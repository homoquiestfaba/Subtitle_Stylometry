A crossing guard?

6
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:33,159
A crossing guard?

7
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:36,728
How did you find out about her?

8
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,670
I almost trusted you.

9
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,946
Just a sec.

10
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:05,626

Sweetie, is that water
hot enough foryou?

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,169
Oh, it's fine.
Thankyou.

15
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,074
Stupid.

16
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:30,586
How many times have I told her
a gun's only effective ifloaded?

17
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,262
- Seeyou later, sweetie.
- Okey-dokey.

18
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,965

19
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,367
Oh, no.

20
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,230
Ican'tbelieve
IaccidentallykilledDick.

21
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,827
Sure wehadourproblems, but,
come on, whatcouple doesn't?

22
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:52,964
Dick wasbasically
aprettyniceguy...

23
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,473
sometimes.

24
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:59,478
You wanna know another thing
I love about this little filly?

25
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:00,571
Not really.

26
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:04,175
The way she screams for me to call her
''puddle britches'' while we're in bed.

27
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,345
That's not--
That's not true.

28
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,082
Come on, it's cute.
You're cute.

29
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,591
So cute, I could
just chewyou right up.

30
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,253
Please. I just had
cocktail weenies.

31
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:17,195
Beforeyou chew me up,
I have to use the ladies' room.

32
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,534
So, Tina,
can I come back toyour place?

33
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:25,265
How drunk doyou think I am?

34
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,734
Guess not.

35
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,319
Hello?

36
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,354
Dick? Hello.

37
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,760
What am I gonna do with you?

38
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:10,076
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

39
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,411
Sorry.

40
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:16,780
Hello, 91 1 ?

41
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,225
I just shot my boyfriend,
but it was an accident.

42
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:23,855
I really don't think
thatjail time is a good idea.

43
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,796
That's not right.

44
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,595
Hello, is this 91 1 ?

45
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,969
Oh, hi.

46
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,066
Hey, listen, a stranger
just broke into my house...

47
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,839
and got my purse
and took my gun out ofmy purse...

48
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,780
and shot my boyfriend
and hid him in the basement.

49
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,185
That's not gonna work.

50
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,358
- Hello.
- Mom, I have to talk toyou.

51
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:05,166
Well, I have to talk toyou too.

52
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,503
What I have to tell you
is very important.

53
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,306
Well, Colleen,
mine is important too.

54
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,313
- Is that Colleen?
- Ofcourse it's Colleen.

55
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,645
Ijustsaid, ''Well, Colleen. ''

56
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,378
Tell her to watch out
for dust mites.

57
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,322
I have to tell you something...

58
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,825
very important about Dick.

59
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:29,192
Listen, sweetie. I just sentyou
some clippings from magazines.

60
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,197
You know, different hairstyles.

61
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,792
Some ofthem wouldlook
justdarlingonyou.

62
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,804
Oh, and some,
you know, diets too.

63
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,466
Tell her about the dust mites.

64
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,135
Sweetie, haveyou heard
from Peter recently?

65
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,008
No, Mother, I haven't
heard from Peter...

66
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,641
because he married my former
best friend, Pamela Grinder.

67
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,150
Remember?

68
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,880
Well, maybe ifyou wore
your hair differently--

69
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:57,820
All right, well,
thanks for the advice.

70
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:58,984
Bye.

71
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,554
I think she's mad.

72
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,466
This day was really
goin'down the tubes.

73
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:14,372
Itallstartedwitha visit tomylocal
alcoholicpsychic, Madame Hugonaut.

74
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:23,745
- You have to believe.
- Oh, I believe.

75
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,181
I see a man, a husband.

76
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,381
- A boyfriend?
- Yes, that's it.

77
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:33,120
And, well, he's going on a trip.
A very long trip.

78
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,521
- No.
- Yes.

79
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,964
He's very secretive.
He does not tell you everything.

80
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,969
Well, he's going to Rome.

81
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:46,605
I thinkyou're mistaken.
Dick hates pasta.

82
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,039
Mistaken?

83
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:51,567
Madame Hugonaut is never mistaken.

84
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,806
- And your husband--
- Boyfriend.

85
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:56,577
Whatever he is,
he's not going alone.

86
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,585
He's taking a young woman.

87
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,749
A crossing guard.

88
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,753
A crossing guard? No.

89
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:11,889
- I seriously doubt that Dickwould--
- Yes, a crossing guard.

90
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,331
I call them ''The Sirens
ofthe School System''...

91
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:19,373
with their long legs
and their bright blue eyes...

92
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,103
and the way theywave
those stop signs around.

93
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:26,271
''Oh, stop. Stop. Stop!''

94
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,976
Madame Hugonaut?

95
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,257
A few days ago...

96
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:41,556
he got into...

97
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,620
a mishap with a car.

98
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:44,857
Yes!

99
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:48,959
Yes. A fender bender
in the parking lot.

100
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,970
Doyou see the other man?

101
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,666
The handsome man
in the black car?

102
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:58,671
Idiot! I'll handle this.

103
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,141
What in the hell wereyou doin'?

104
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:09,019
Obeying the law.
What wereyou doing?

105
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,957
I was backin' out.
You were driving like a maniac.

106
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,051
Wow! Cool car.

107
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:17,359
-Colleen, mind your own business.
-You were the one driving like a maniac.

108
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,831
Yeah? Why don't we get
the cops here and see?

109
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,960
There's no need to get the cops here.
It's a little fender bender.

110
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,629
Oh, no, look.

111
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:28,072
See, your light thingy
is all crushed.

112
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:31,373
Doyou understand that ''mind your
own business'' means ''shut up''?

113
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,242
Why don't we leave her out ofit?

114
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,579
She's innocent.
She's cute too.

115
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,321
Stop trying to change the subject.

116
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,917
There's no subject, buddy.
I'm getting in my car, and I'm leaving.

117
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:51,488
It was nice meeting you.

118
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,302
Hope I run intoyou again soon.

119
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:03,066
I seeyour husband
and the crossing guard...

120
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,078
having an affair.

121
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,171
They're running offto Rome
together. Capisce?

122
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:09,978
Ifyou went home this second, you would
see her standing at the doorway...

123
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,245
with the bags all packed
waiting to leaveyou.

124
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,050
Mark mywords.
Go. Go.

125
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:36,367
That so-and-so
was taking my clothes.

126
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:42,074
I suppose his crossing guard
was my size too.

127
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,485
I could kill him again.

128
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:49,923
Hello?

129
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,892
Iknow who this is.

130
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,124
You verymeanlady! You'renever

00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,736

- This woman I metyesterday.

132
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,145
Hope to run intoyou again.

133
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,442
- Danny.
- Hey, Sis.

134
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,815
I've got something to tell you.

135
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,857
-Jared, he's--
- Danny!

136
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,329
Why don'tyoujoin me

137
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:06,992
Some ofthe boys have
a game offootball goin'.

138
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,370
Seeya, Sis.

139
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,806
Hey, Danny!

140
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:29,215
Would you be so kind as to favor us
with one ofyour beautiful songs?

141
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,224
- Not today, Mike.
- Come on.

142
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,226
Sorry, Mike.
I don't sing anymore.

143
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,228
Back toyour game, boys.

144
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,130
Did you rub Dick Rasmusson yet?

145
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,599
- He ran into me.
- What?

146
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,900
I was trailing him, you know,
trying to get a good shot at him...

147
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,941
and he backed into my car
not more than 20 minutes ago.

148
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,942
Did you rub him?

149
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,343
No, I didn't have an opportunity to.
He was with a woman.

150
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,542
In the name ofthe wee man, I asked you
to pop this guy over a week ago.

151
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:59,677
- I need this to happen now!
- I know.

152
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:02,916
I'll do it.
I'll ''X'' him tomorrow.

153
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,595
I transferred you from
the accounting department...

154
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,427
to the hit man department,
what, twoyears ago.

155
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,966
Yes. So?

156
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:18,232
So in that time, how many people
doyou thinkyou've actually killed?

157
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:21,035
- Technically?
- Sure, technically.

158
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,167
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you: none.

159
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:25,575
Rien. Nada. Nothin'. Zilch.

160
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:28,080
In twoyears, you haven't
doled out so much as a black eye.

161
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:31,379
Frankly, I'm disappointed.
I expected more from an American.

162
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:34,182
Senator Dove.
What about him? He's dead.

163
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:37,155
Senator Dove
died ofa heart attack.

164
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,921
He had a heart attackwhile I was hiding
in his closet waiting to kill him.

165
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:44,259
- Not a true rub.
- Areyou saying I'm yellow?

166
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:48,199
I'm not sayin' you're any color.
I'm sayin' maybeyour heart isn't in it.

167
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:51,931
Maybeyou should get back to accounting
whereyou don't have to kill people.

168
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,064
I can kill people
as good as the next guy.

169
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:58,009
Aye, Danny, care to favor us with
one ofyour beautiful songs today?

170
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,478
I haven't sang in twoyears.

171
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:04,881
Come on, Patrick. You know our Danny
hasn't sang since Mary broke his heart.

172
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:08,115
Ah, yes, the Mary incident.

173
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:12,147
Oh, Dannyboy

174
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:17,562
Iloveyouso

175
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:32,767
Could we please forget
about the Mary incident?

176
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,871
Jesus. Don't bite
the head offus.

177
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:38,975
We wasjust sayin' you could be
one ofthe great singers ofour time.

178
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,385
All the great singers are Italian:
Frank, Dino, Tony--

179
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,889
That'sjustyour opinion.

180
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:47,393
It's also my opinion you should shut
your gob! All great singers are Italian.

181
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:50,294
-Just like the mobsters.
- You watch it, Tommy.

182
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:52,059
I'm Patrick.

183
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,066
I'm sorry.
You watch it, Patrick.

184
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,398
- What did I do?
- Notyou, Patrick!

185
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,633
Ifthe Irish can't sing,
then what about Bing Crosby?

186
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,903
Oh, forget Bing Crosby. The man
talked his way through every song.

187
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:06,076
- What aboutJohn McCormick?
- Yeah.

188
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,046
Our Danny can sing
as good as him.

189
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,811
Sure. He should be
up on the stage singing.

190
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:13,352
Yeah, I'm not a singer.
I'm a hit man.

191
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,945
And I'm gonna kill Dick Rasmusson.

192
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:19,254
- I'll implement my new plan tomorrow.
- What's that?

193
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:22,261
I'm gonna get to him
through his girlfriend.

194
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,662
Oh, whoop-dee-do.
Seems like quite a plan.

195
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:52,684
- You're not pressing charges, areyou?
- What a coincidence.

196
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,284
You and your boyfriend...

197
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,796
ran into me at Target.

198
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:02,223
Ex-boyfriend, actually.

199
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,770
- Ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.

200
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,706
Things reallyweren't
working out verywell.

201
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:10,743
You are Colleen Gibson, right?

202
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,405
- Yes.
- The artist?

203
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:15,608
Yes.

204
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,353
I'm Daniel Gallagher.
I'm an art dealer.

205
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,948
I just thought I'd stop by
and take a look at some ofyour stuff.

206
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,256
- Oh.
- Can we go toyour studio?

207
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,796
I don't have a studio.

208
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,889
Doyou paint
down in your basement?

209
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:36,493
Well, yes,
but we can't go down there.

210
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,561
Why not?

211
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,473
Just 'cause it's messy
and there's rats.

212
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,670
But I'll tell you what.

213
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:48,306
I have other paintings in the garage
ifyou'd like to see those.

214
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,644
Sure.

215
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:56,948
Welcome to the
Colleen Gibson collection.

216
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,457
This is nice.

217
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,821
So, I call this one Red.

218
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,489
I see.

219
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,260
This is Green.

220
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:11,770
Makes sense.

221
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,570
Let me guess. Blue.

222
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,702
Yes. How'd you know?

223
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,271
A lucky guess.
You have a very distinctive style.

224
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,785
Well, yes, but...

225
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,844
as you can see, I'm sort of...

226
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,117
running low on ideas.

227
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:35,651
Yeah? Why don'tyou buy
a 64-box ofCrayolas?

228
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,166
I know art, and these are--

229
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:46,729
Well, they're pretty great.
They're truly neat.

230
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:50,971
And they're great.
They're really great.

231
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,306
Blue is my favorite one.

232
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:58,909
Mine too.
There's a lot ofblue in there.

233
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:02,080
Guess I kind ofdid it
in my blue period.

234
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,593
You know, like Picasso
had a blue period.

235
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,220
You know, I love his stufftoo.

236
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,668
Well, how much
doyou want for this one?

237
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:19,570
I don't know.
I've never sold a painting.

238
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,341
Two hundred dollars.

239
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,346
Sounds about right.

240
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,250
Thankyou.

241
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,292
- I have one more thing to askyou.
- What's that?

242
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,190
- Out.
- Out?

243
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:46,096
Out. I wanna askyou out, seeing
as your boyfriend is an ''ex'' and all.

244
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,067
Well, it'sjust that...

245
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:52,196
you know, the breakup
is still so new.

246
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:56,742
I'm just sort of
getting used to it.

247
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,802
Well, you have two hours
to get used to it.

248
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,644
I'll be back around 6:00.

249
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,708
I've got some errands
to attend to. Okay?

250
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:20,559
- Bye.
- Seeyou.

251
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,874
- Who is it?
- It's me.

252
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:37,041
- Who?
- It's me, Colin.

253
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,320
- Sorry.
- Howyou doin'?

254
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,322
- I'm okay.
- Good.

255
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,966
- Where'd you get that painting?
- I just bought it.

256
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,597
- That sure is blue.
- It is, isn't it?

257
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:02,107
I didn't want to leave it out
in the car in this neighborhood.

258
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,768
That would look really good
over the new sofa Mollyjust got.

259
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,439
How much doyou want for that?

260
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,915
- Wanna buy it?
- Sure.

261
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,612
I think I'm gonna keep it.
Sentimental reasons.

262
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,383
- I'll giveyou 500 bucks for that.
- Five hundred?

263
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:19,789
Yep. There is
a lot ofblue in there.

264
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,489
No, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna hang on to it.

265
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:25,861
Think ofit as
my retirement gift.

266
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,526
Retirement gift?
What, areyou retiring?

267
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,696
I'm goin' back
to get my genealogy degree.

268
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,037
Lot less dangerous
than this Mafia business.

269
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:39,010
You know, Colin,
we're not in the Mafia.

270
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,341
We're Irish.

271
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:44,645
You know what?

272
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:47,619
Just take the painting.
It's fine.

273
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,088
I know where I can get
another onejust like it.

274
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,025
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's fine.

275
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,429
What doyou know?

276
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,488
I'm an art dealer
after all, huh?

277
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,932
- I'm an art collector.
- That's good.

278
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,936
Molly's gonna love this.
She loves blue.

279
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,938
That's great, Colin.

280
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:10,209
You Scotch-taped him to a chair?

281
00:21:10,277 --> 00:21:12,837
Can you believe
I forgot the rope?

282
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:15,108
I had to use Scotch--
Look how sticky that is.

283
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:17,776
- It sticks to the wool.
- Yeah, it's sticky.

284
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:22,044
Hey, Pee Wee.
I'm sorry.

285
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:26,024
Wejust got caught up
in a little gangland small talk.

286
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,923
Howyou doin'?

287
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:34,896
- Okay. Colin?
- Yeah?

288
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,902
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

289
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,528
Let's do it.

290
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:41,469
Let's go.

291
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:48,180
Went to mass this morning, right?
Had my gun.

292
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:51,684
Then, a couple minutes agoyou came in
the door, and I gotyou with a painting.

293
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:55,312
Looked again-- gone.
Believe that?

294
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:59,758
You're offthe hook, Pee Wee.

295
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,953
Don't do it again, because--

296
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:04,087
No. Wait, wait.

297
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:07,463
One second.Jared said
we have to ''X'' this guy today.

298
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,468
- We don't have a gun.
- I know that.

299
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,699
But what I can do is
I'll find something...

300
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:18,142
with which we can bludgeon our
good old friend Pee Wee to death with.

301
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:30,318
I know this sounds
terrible, Dick...

302
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,654
butyour death...

303
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,093
has really opened me up.

304
00:22:36,162 --> 00:22:38,357
Creatively, I mean.

305
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,200
Crossing guard?

306
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:46,037
Where in the world
did you meet a crossing guard?

307
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:54,939
Crossing guard, remember me?

308
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,880
Last week, back ofmy car?

309
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,680
That loose spring
took a chunk out ofyour ass.

310
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:04,680
Oh, you little siren.

311
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:14,131
You guys are cops, aren'tyou?

312
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,998
We are, in fact,
plainclothes detectives.

313
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,063
I knew it. I can smell a cop
with one nostril tied behind my back.

314
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:24,406
I myselfam a private dick.
Name's Dick Rasmusson.

315
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,037
You've probably seen
my television commercials.

316
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:29,047
Areyou trying to findsomeone?

317
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:33,449

327
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:05,512
You guys here on some kind ofstakeout?
A prostitution ring or somethin'?

328
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,177
- Nope.
- We'rejust horny.

329
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:09,744
- Like everybody else.
- I'm workin' right now.

330
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,917
Doin' a little tail job.
The adultery thing.

331
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,427
I'm tailin' a big-time mobster.

332
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,794
Ain't nobody here
but us and that nurse.

333
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,732
He's not here today.
He usually is, though.

334
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:26,101
He comes here almost every other day
for a different woman. Fantasy thing.

335
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:30,871
Takes them to the Pink Flamingo for
the old ten toes up and ten toes down.

336
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:32,673
A real romantic guy.

337
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:36,045
Eitheryou fellas attached?
You know, lady-wise?

338
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:38,584
Ifwe were married,
doyou thinkwe'd be here?

339
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,643
Well, I got a girlfriend,
but I got a big surprise for her.

340
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:43,746
She's not gonna be
my girlfriend for long.

341
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:47,623
- Why not?
- Well, I'll tell you--

342
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:53,965
- The sad thing is, I've seen his ads.
- Me too.

343
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,127
- And I kinda like 'em.
- Me too.

344
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,308
- Hello?
- You over him yet?

345
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:10,941
- Is this Daniel Gallagher, art dealer?
- Youknowit.

346
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:12,951
I'll be there in an hour.

347
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:16,250
- Found some murdering devices.
- Gotta go.

348
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,267
That's nice.

349
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:36,368
Informants.
Always have the best stuff.

350
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,873
Not for long, though.

351
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:42,141
Okay, now...

352
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,013
everybody's gotta be real quiet
while I drive.

353
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,017
Just wanna say that this is your
first legit rub, and I'm proud ofyou.

354
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,686
Go get him.

355
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:58,753
Wait a minute.

356
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,401
You got any last requests, Pee Wee?
You want a cigarette or somethin'?

357
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:10,705
I've always liked the wayyou sang
''When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.''

358
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:13,343
Come on.

359
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:16,075
- I don't sing anymore.
- Come on, man!

360
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:18,674
You gotta do it!
Come on, Danny!

361
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,185
Hello? I just asked you.
That's what I want.

362
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:24,485
It's part ofthejob!
You wanna be a murderer now!

363
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,354
This once, okay?

364
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:41,540

That was beautiful, Danny.
Simply beautiful.

374
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:29,686
Thankyou. Thanks.

375
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:36,625
Sorry. It's gettin' late.
I gotta go. I got a date.

376
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:41,728
It'd be great ifyou could
play through for me.

377
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:45,897
Yeah. You were so close though, Dan.
Just bash his head in.

378
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:47,803
You can do it.

379
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,676
I got some things I gotta do.

380
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:55,942
And maybeyou could
tellJared that I did it.

381
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,148
- Break the eighth?
- The eighth?

382
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,088
The eighth commandment:
Thou shall not lie.

383
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:06,717
That doesn't sit
too well with me.

384
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:09,284
Right. Okay.

385
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:13,124
- You'll do it though, right?
- Yeah.

386
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,100
Okay. I'll--
I'll seeyou guys later.

387
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,702
Thanks for the song, man.

388
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,100
Yeah, sure, Pee Wee.

389
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,053
- These are nice.
- Thanks.

390
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:36,383
My set is shit.

391
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:42,819
Ifyou can-- ifyou can't,
you can't, but ifyou can--

392
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:46,160
right before I make contact...

393
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:48,962
let me know ifmy left arm
is straight.

394
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:54,573
You know what?

395
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:58,202
Whywould I waste a perfectly
good driver on your thick skull?

396
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:18,926
Molly don't love blue
as much as I love golf.

397
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:39,475
Wow. It's beautiful.

398
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:43,352
Come here tojog or fish?

399
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:46,915
Oh, my family. They like
to come out here and shoot.

400
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,358
Shoot?

401
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,558
Wow. An armed art dealer.

402
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:04,505
- See that target down there?
- Yeah.

403
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:06,909
- Showyou how it's done.
- Okay.

404
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,550
That's not that bad.

405
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:23,151
- Wanna try?
- Oh, no.

406
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:25,663
Not really, no.

407
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:28,633
Haveyou ever fired
a gun before?

408
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,534
- Not really, no.
- It's simple.

409
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:33,663
Youjust aim and shoot,
that's all.

410
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,901
- Kind oflike hair spray.
- Yeah.

411
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:38,808
Here. Give it a try.

412
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,311
Go on.

413
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:57,559
Thereyou go.

414
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:04,664
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

415
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,364
I don't know.

416
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,771
Shooting targets sure can work up
an appetite. You know what I could eat?

417
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:14,745
- What?
- A big red, bloody steak.

418
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,550
I can probably arrange that.

419
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,495
So tell me more about Dick.

420
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,869
- Where is he?
- No, not Dick.

421
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,337
I don't even want
to think about him.

422
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:44,866
I'm just curious, that's all.
Like, where areyou sending his mail?

423
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,744
Why doyou ask
so many questions about Dick?

424
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:50,976
What areyou,
a cop or something?

425
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:55,214
I'm the opposite ofa cop.

426
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,489
An art dealer's
the opposite ofa cop?

427
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,959
No, I wasjust curious...

428
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:06,089
as to why Dickwould
leaveyou, you know?

429
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:10,101
I mean, you seem like
a really nice person.

430
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:14,500
Thankyou.
That's very flattering.

431
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:17,933
What doyou saywe go
start having a little fun?

432
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,103
Oh. More shooting?

433
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,615
No. No more shooting.

434
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:26,618
Somethin' more romantic.

435
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,652
You know what I don't
understand about Dick?

436
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:38,288
Oh, forget Dick.
He's gone.

437
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:40,559
You make it sound like he's dead.

438
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,395
I wish he were.

439
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:48,506
Hey, you know what
this party is missing? Music.

440
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:51,008
Oh, sure.
I've got some tapes in there.

441
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,242
What's this?
It says ''Me.''

442
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:05,822
- What is it?
- It's nothing. It's a secret.

443
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:08,452
IfI had a secret,
I'd tell you.

444
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,622
Areyou tryin' to tell me
you don't have any secrets?

445
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:14,188
You're changing the subject.
We're talking about that tape.

446
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:16,963
- No dice.
- I'm not above tickling.

447
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,561
Oh, no.
Please, please.

448
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:27,880
I used to fancy myself
something ofa singer.

449
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:30,415
Oh, cool.
So let's hear it.

450
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,447
Why not?

451
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:35,487
Because it'sjust not
a part ofmy life anymore.

452
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,082
It'sjust a stupid dream,
that's all.

453
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:42,321
Don't say that.
What happened?

454
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,965
I had this girlfriend.

455
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:50,969
Really serious girlfriend.

456
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,028
Her name was Mary.

457
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,836
She thought my singing
was silly, so...

458
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,571
she finally left me
for another guy.

459
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,507
I thought I'd change careers,
try somethin'...

460
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:09,246
more manly, you know?

461
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,589
Art?

462
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:21,091
Yeah, well,
I mostly deal in...

463
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:24,364
like really manly art.

464
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:31,466
And I don't sing.

465
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:34,980
Ifthat's the wayyou wanna be.
But I still wanna hear that tape.

466
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,537
Sorry.

467
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,847
I think singing is very manly.

468
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:46,950
Really?

469
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:49,119
Really.

470
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,555
So, please,
can I hear the tape?

471
00:34:56,335 --> 00:34:58,895
Butyou have to promise me
not to laugh.

472
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,565
I promise. I cross my heart.
I hope to die.

473
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,804
Well, let's hope nothing
that drastic has to happen.

474
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:09,539
Oh, boy.

475
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,509
Oh, man.

476
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,951
Here we go.

477
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:21,190
In Banbridge Town
in the CountyDown

478
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,923
Onemorning lastJuly

479
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,592
From aboreengreen
cameasweetcolleen

480
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:32,269
You're good!

481
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,501
You're really, really good!

482
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:38,407
You shouldn't be an art dealer.
You should be a professional singer.

483
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:42,813
- That's really sweet ofyou to say.
- I'm not being sweet.

484
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:44,315
I mean it.

485
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:47,552
It's never gonna happen,
but thanks.

486
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,248
Never say never.

487
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:53,891
So I told you
one ofmy secrets.

488
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:58,953
Nowyou have to tell me one of
your secrets thatyou don't have.

489
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,504
Well, here's one.

490
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:13,170
I think I'm falling foryou.

491
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,487
I have another secret.

492
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:28,618
It's a little harder than
the ''I'm falling foryou'' variety.

493
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,324
What is it?

494
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:43,298
I know this looks really bad.

495
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,275
That's Dick. He's--

496
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:47,904
- Wereyou gonna say dead?
- Yeah.

497
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,815
I'm just gonna tell you
the whole truth, okay?

498
00:36:53,886 --> 00:36:58,186
I killed him.
But it was in self-defense.

499
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,749
Well, I guess self-defense
really isn't the proper term...

500
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:04,660
but it was--
it was an accident.

501
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,633
Soyoujust pointed the gun
at him and bang, right?

502
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:12,227
Well, it wasn't that simple.

503
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:15,000
That's really--
That's amazing.

504
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:20,506
It's amazing.
Wow, what a coincidence.

505
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,638
Why doyou say
it's a coincidence?

506
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,384
You and Dick, you know?
And you killing Dick.

507
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,856
When you put it like that,
you make it sound so mean.

508
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,359
Well, hey, listen.

509
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,488
Dickwas a grade-A asshole,
Colleen.

510
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,866
- I guess you're right.
- Ofcourse.

511
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:00,485
Colleen, this is--

512
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:05,384
This is really great, but...

513
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,449
maybe not right here.

514
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,642
Daniel?

515
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:32,347
''Dearest Colleen,
sorry to leave so early...

516
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:34,750
but I had some business
to take care of.

517
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,846
I will be back soon. Daniel.

518
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,948
PS I took Dickwith me.''

519
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:42,855
Ilook up

520
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:46,386
Yoursmile fills
myheart with glee

521
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:52,028

522
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:59,269

00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,813
AndIhope thatIcan
offeryouenough

524
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,753
I've been keepin' track.

525
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:14,619
- Hi, Hurley.
- I've been keepin' track.

526
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:18,322
This here's the 37th corpse that
Jared and the O'Reilly family boys...

527
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,991
left here in my dump,
and it don't make me too proud.

528
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,092
Don't tell meyou've accidentally
stumbled upon a conscience.

529
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:29,436
Well, recently I've been gettin'
a feeling that someone or...

530
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:34,241
something's been watching over me,
watchin' everything I do.

531
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:36,042
Maybe it's God.

532
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:39,949
Don't go all nutty on me
and the O'Reilly family, okay?

533
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:43,455
We payyou good money to useyour dump
as our private graveyard.

534
00:39:43,522 --> 00:39:46,320
I know. I'm just
out-loud thinkin'.

535
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:48,326
Just out-loud thinkin',
that's all.

536
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:51,693
Hey, what variety is this?
Is it a snitch?

537
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:55,860
Turncoat? Some three-time loser
couldn't come up with the cash?

538
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,894
Private dick.

539
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,342
That's a first.
Why'd you plug a dick?

540
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:09,705
I don't know.
Jared wanted it done.

541
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,773
Don'tyou ask questions, boy?

542
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,978
What ifJared wanted your grandmother
done? Would you ask him why?

543
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:17,488
What areyou getting at?

544
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:20,491
I'm just sayin' I don't trustJared
any further than I can throw ajukebox.

545
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,686
And I can't throw
ajukebox too far.

546
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:25,321
Now why doyou figure
he wanted a dick killed?

547
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:28,161
I don't know.
Just doing myjob.

548
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:30,997
Maybeyou oughta think
about whatyou're doin'.

549
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:36,937
I'll think about that.

550
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:39,409
Have a nice day.

551
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,275
Oh, Hurley?

552
00:40:41,347 --> 00:40:44,714
Ifyou see God around,
tell Him to have a nice day too.

553
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,735
Hold your fuckin' horses.

554
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:14,134
- Hello,Jared.
- It's you.

555
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:20,082
I did it.
I got Dick.

556
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,280
You don't believe me?
Go ask Dick.

557
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,450
I'd like to.
Take me to the dearly departed.

558
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,994
- Areyou doubting me?
- I'm doubtin' nothin'.

559
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:31,996
You and me will go look
at the dead fella...

560
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:34,828
then grab a bite
ofbrunch or somethin'.

561
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:39,329
Okay, but I wantyou to know
I'm hurt in here.

562
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:42,135
Ah, you're hurt in here.
I feel your pain.

563
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:43,640
Now...

564
00:41:45,477 --> 00:41:48,105
let's you and me go look at
that dead body, hmm?

565
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:55,280
He's gone to the saints,
all right.

566
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:57,754
- Goodjob.
- Thankyou.

567
00:41:57,823 --> 00:42:00,348
It's about time
I got a little respect.

568
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:03,156
Don't be so sensitive.
I loveyou like a brother.

569
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:06,197
Pay no mind to me.
I'm justjaw whackin'.

570
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:09,666
Let's get out ofhere.
I gotta dump Dick's car.

571
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,465
Hold on toyour pint.
Did you check him for dough?

572
00:42:12,538 --> 00:42:15,029
- Dough?
- Backwhen I was a hitter...

573
00:42:15,107 --> 00:42:18,975
I got an extra hundred a weekjust
from goin' through dead guys' wallets.

574
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:20,807
Typical dick. No green.

575
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:25,644
Some ofthese guys work their
tails off for nothin', you know?

576
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:29,209
Look at this.
One punch away from a free latte.

577
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,519
Some guys have no luck.

578
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,024
Doyou like them lattes?

579
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,791
Fair play toyou.
Only idiots like that stuff.

580
00:42:38,864 --> 00:42:40,832
What else we got?

581
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:42,867
Jesus Himself.

582
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,130
An engagement ring.

583
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,069
The stupid bastard.

584
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:49,539
This guy's a regular
CrackerJack box.

585
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,008
What else we got?
Air tickets.

586
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:54,341
He was goin' somewhere.

587
00:42:55,547 --> 00:42:58,209
- Rome!
- Rome, Georgia?

588
00:42:58,283 --> 00:43:00,808
No. Pope-y Rome.

589
00:43:00,886 --> 00:43:02,820
Come on.
Get me outta here.

590
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:15,025
So, why'd you want
this Dick fella killed anyway?

591
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,092
I wanted him killed
because I wanted him killed.

592
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,661
Is that good enough foryou,
question boy?

593
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,673
Come here. Here.

594
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:28,537
What is this?

595
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:33,381
That's an envelope, brains.
Inside is the prize: three names.

596
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,420
Windsor, Stuart and Tudor.
Who are they?

597
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,946
- Three big-time drug dealers.
- Oh, they're bad.

598
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:43,426
They stiffed me last week. I want them
turned into stiffs this week.

599
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:47,295
They hang out in the warehouse by
dock five all the time, playin' cards.

600
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:49,732
I'd like them killed
by the end ofthe week.

601
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:52,770
I can't.
I have things to do.

602
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,965
Like what?
You're a hit man. You kill.

603
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:02,102
- No. Sorry.
- Danny, let's face it.

604
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,140
You seem to have developed a nose
for this kind ofbusiness.

605
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:09,949
I need you, Danny.
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

606
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:16,622
Ayear ago,
what was your big dream?

607
00:44:17,496 --> 00:44:18,929
What does this have to do--

608
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:22,660
You wanted to be a great Irish singer.
Here's the deal.

609
00:44:22,734 --> 00:44:27,330
You make five hits for me, and
I will install you, as the headliner...

610
00:44:27,406 --> 00:44:29,499
at the Shillelagh Room.

611
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,044
Shillelagh Room.

612
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,950
- I don't wanna be a singer.
- Ofcourseyou want to be a singer.

613
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,316
When I said,
''the Shillelagh Room''...

614
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:45,481
a wee light went on in your eye
I haven't seen in quite some time.

615
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,854
You want to sing.

616
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:51,890
Okay, okay, I wanna sing.

617
00:44:51,964 --> 00:44:55,923
Ofcourseyou do.
So make the hits and get the gig.

618
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,497
What ifI don't?

619
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,636
Then I'll have to kill you.

620
00:45:22,427 --> 00:45:25,988
- Whereyou been?
- I dumped him.

621
00:45:26,064 --> 00:45:27,895
Dick?

622
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:30,662
- Yeah, Dick.
- Where?

623
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:34,001
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna find him.

624
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:39,939
That is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

625
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,342
You know,
I never meant to kill him.

626
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,385
But he reallywas ajerk.

627
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:49,386
He was a liar.

628
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,924
You'd never lie to me, right?

629
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,659
No, I neverwould.

630
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,925
What am I gonna do about Dick?

631
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:04,992
We are going to act
as ifnothing's wrong.

632
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,564
'Cause when the cops come, and they
will, they'll come packin' questions.

633
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,603
Is there a social event or something
you and Dickwere planning to go to...

634
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:18,946
like a play or--

635
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:22,475
Well, I was planning on throwing him
a surprise party tonight...

636
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:24,488
but I guess that's
right out the window.

637
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:28,515
No, that's perfect.
Go ahead and have it.

638
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:30,891
- But Dick is dead.
- I know.

639
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:33,556
Who throws a party
for a dead man?

640
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:37,625
Somebodywho doesn't know he's dead,
right? Go ahead and throw him a party.

641
00:46:37,703 --> 00:46:40,035
You're right off
the suspect list.

642
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:13,598
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah, Colleen.

643
00:47:13,672 --> 00:47:16,937
-I'm going to marry her.
-I wish I had some rice to throw atyou.

644
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:20,844
Take a gander at this.

645
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:23,176
Ever seen a rock this big before?

646
00:47:23,248 --> 00:47:26,274
How can some two-bit gumshoe such
as yourselfafford such a luxury item?

647
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:29,582
Haven't been selling
your body, haveyou, Dick?

648
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:32,623
That big mobster I was
tellin' you about, the tail job?

649
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:35,524
He's got a wife who's willing
to pay through the nose for the truth.

650
00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:39,155
And, ofcourse,
I don't have anything against that.

651
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:43,031
- So I bought Colleen this ring.
- Sounds like real love.

652
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:46,093
Call it whatyou want.
I call it securing my investment.

653
00:47:46,171 --> 00:47:49,140
- Not following you.
- Colleen's worth a mint.

654
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:52,608
Or should I say someday
she's gonna be worth a mint.

655
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:56,135
Her old man invented
the rosy-red grapefruit.

656
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:58,682
- I love those.
- Once he kicks...

657
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,618
hervalue goes through the roof,
and I wanna get in on the ground floor.

658
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:05,747
I got an appointment with ajudge,
and then we're offto Rome.

659
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,485
Rome, Italy?

660
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,017
- What other Rome is there?
- There's a Rome, Georgia.

661
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,257
Who the hell would honeymoon
in Rome, Georgia?

662
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:15,265
I bet it happens.

663
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:18,598
Anyway, tomorrow I'm gonna
come home in the middle ofthe day...

664
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,662
when she's not expecting me,
and without saying nothin'...

665
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,709
I'm gonna play ''Leavin' On aJet Plane''
on the guitar.

666
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,404
Afterwhich, I'm gonna
ask her to marry me.

667
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:29,572
''Leavin' On aJet Plane''?

668
00:48:29,648 --> 00:48:32,344
Oh, man, that's a classic.
I love that song.

669
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,885
Sad song for a happy occasion.

670
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,319
Admittedly.
It's the only song I know.

671
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:39,880
Maybe she'll thinkyou're
runnin' offwith anotherwoman.

672
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,654
Colleen's not that smart,
and even ifshe did think that...

673
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:45,628
she'd probably run offcrying.

674
00:48:45,697 --> 00:48:48,860
- You don't know Colleen.
- Women are unpredictable.

675
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:51,864
Ifyou'll excuse me...

676
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:54,405
I have some compromising
pictures to mail.

677
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:01,575
I entered you.

678
00:49:03,515 --> 00:49:04,948
Excuse me?

679
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,688
I saw a poster
at the grocery store.

680
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:13,223
You know that
radio station, WXI U?

681
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,225
They're having
a talent contest...

682
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:18,729
and the winner gets
a thousand dollars...

683
00:49:18,797 --> 00:49:21,197
and a recording contract.

684
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:24,292
Colleen, I'm not ''singer guy.''

685
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:26,769
I'm ''art dealer guy.''

686
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:30,365
Butyou have
such a beautiful voice.

687
00:49:31,676 --> 00:49:33,974
You have a talent.

688
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:36,445
It'd be criminal not to use it.

689
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,449
I can't.

690
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:42,880
Forget that old girlfriend.

691
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,788
Mary.

692
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,381
Yes, Mary.

693
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:50,954
Forget about her.
She's the past.

694
00:49:58,303 --> 00:50:00,237
I wantyou to sing.

695
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,136
You have to believe in yourself,
'cause I believe in you...

696
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,405
and I don't want to be wrong.

697
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:13,879
Good.

698
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:21,053
Now that that's settled,
let's get some brunch.

699
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:25,830
- I can't.
- Why not?

700
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,457
'Cause I have to get rid
ofthe murderweapon.

701
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:38,071
Hey, cuz.

702
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:40,873
How did I know I'd find you drinking
in the middle ofthe afternoon?

703
00:50:40,946 --> 00:50:42,538
I don't know, cuz.

704
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,012
I guess you're one
ofthose clairvoyants, huh?

705
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,848
Hey, how's the hit man
business doing?

706
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,514
Would you keep
yourvoice down, please?

707
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,123
Look, I got a favor to askyou.

708
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:59,527
''Mr. Fancy Pants'' has to ask
old ''Mr. Down And Out'' for a favor.

709
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,465
- This ought to be rich.
- Shut up.

710
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:04,058
Here.

711
00:51:05,503 --> 00:51:06,834
A gun.

712
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:11,967
And to think those damn nuns
wouldn't letyou out ofseventh grade.

713
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:15,440
That's hilarious.
Wait a second.

714
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:18,744
Don't tell meyou finally
went and killed somebody.

715
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:20,910
Look, I need you
to ditch this for me, okay?

716
00:51:23,488 --> 00:51:25,786
Why don'tyou ditch it?
You're the hit man.

717
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:28,087
I just sell sinks
for a living, remember?

718
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:31,759
Don't kid yourself, Rex.
You assist a man who sells sinks.

719
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,390
I can't ditch it 'cause
I have a lot to do today.

720
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,128
Why don'tyou have one of
your Mafia friends ditch it foryou?

721
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:41,670
How many times do I have
to tell you we're not the Mafia?

722
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:44,072
We're Irish.

723
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,975
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

724
00:51:47,045 --> 00:51:49,570
Look, I don't want to get
involved with any ofthis crap.

725
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,913
Maybe this will alleviate
some ofyour fears.

726
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,146
Two hundred dollars?

727
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:00,483
Good.

728
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:02,549
Take the gun and throw it
in a lake or something.

729
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:05,687
Nothing's gonna happen
unless you screw it up.

730
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,531
- Colleen.
- Yeah?

731
00:52:13,605 --> 00:52:17,200
I hate to be a party pooper,
but my legs are getting cramped.

732
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:19,903
All right.
We don't have to hide anymore.

733
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,879
Something must have
happened to Dick.

734
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:31,444
- Can we eat the cake?
- Sure.

735
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:35,225
I got it.

736
00:52:35,293 --> 00:52:36,692
Hello?

737
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:39,992
Hi, Danny? You told me
to call this number at 9:00.

738
00:52:40,065 --> 00:52:41,225
What?

739
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:45,395
- You said to call at 9:00.
- What the hell areyou talking about?

740
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,166
It's 9:00 and you said to call.

741
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,537
Oh, yeah?

742
00:52:50,608 --> 00:52:52,940
Screwyou too, then, Dick!

743
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:02,878
Boy, you're not gonna believe this.

744
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:07,054
That was Dick.
He is at the airport.

745
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:11,694
He's running away
with anotherwoman.

746
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:14,323
Guess the surprise party's off.

747
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,732
Wow, look at the time.

748
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:25,866
Seeyou.

749
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:32,239
Night.

750
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,216
- Seeyou.
- Yeah.

751
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:50,490
- Gosh, that was really smart.
- It was, wasn't it?

752
00:53:50,568 --> 00:53:53,503
Now the police won't suspect
anything when Dick turns up missing.

753
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:55,562
I don't know.
Something could go wrong.

754
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,201
No, nothing's gonna go wrong.
Everything is gonna go right.

755
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,268
We got awaywith it.

756
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,416
- But I'm a killer.
- Butyou're really good at it.

757
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:11,981
- I am?
- Yeah!

758
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:14,490
You should be proud ofyourself.
You're a natural.

759
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,153
- Lots ofpeople can't do whatyou do.
- Really?

760
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:20,095
- Yeah, really.
- Who's that?

761
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:22,360
I don't know.
Somebody probably forgot something.

762
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:23,923
Let me get it.

763
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:25,993
- Hurry back.
- Okay.

764
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:32,603
Yes?

765
00:54:32,677 --> 00:54:34,440
You Colleen Gibson?

766
00:54:35,113 --> 00:54:36,273
Yes.

767
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:38,838
- O'Halloran.
- Murphy.

768
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:40,509
May I helpyou?

769
00:54:40,585 --> 00:54:43,520
You're on the wrong side
ofthe fence to be asking questions.

770
00:54:44,422 --> 00:54:46,083
What side am I on?

771
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,093
- The wrong side.
- How well you know Pee Wee Greelitch?

772
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,026
- Who?
-John Greelitch.

773
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:55,122
Nicknamed ''Pee Wee''
due to his immense girth.

774
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,363
- I don't know anyone named Pee Wee.
- Funny.

775
00:54:58,436 --> 00:54:59,869
He knewyou.

776
00:54:59,938 --> 00:55:03,339
At least well enough to be beaten
to death by one ofyour paintings.

777
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:04,636
What?

778
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:06,768
Just spill your guts
about Pee Wee Greelitch.

779
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,437
I don't understand.

780
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,378
Pee Wee was beaten to death
byyour painting.

781
00:55:10,448 --> 00:55:13,679
Perhaps you could shed some light
on this interesting scenario.

782
00:55:13,751 --> 00:55:16,879
- Painting was blue.
- Real blue.

783
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,585
I sold that painting.

784
00:55:19,657 --> 00:55:23,354
I sold it a long time ago
at an art fair.

785
00:55:23,428 --> 00:55:26,795
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- To whom?

786
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,528
I don't remember.

787
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:33,127
Ifthere's one thing I hate,
it's a poor memory.

788
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,331
He was a large man.

789
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:38,204
- With brown hair?
- Yes.

790
00:55:38,276 --> 00:55:42,007
- Brown eyes?
- I believe, yes.

791
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,048
Perfectly round head?

792
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:49,813
- Yes, it was a spherical-shaped head.
- Damn!

793
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,482
- That's Pee Wee all right.
- You described him to a tee.

794
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,492
Sorry to disturbyou, ma'am.
I guess our hunch was wrong.

795
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:58,553
That's all right.

796
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,621
All right, ifthat's it--

797
00:56:01,466 --> 00:56:02,956
Good night.

798
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:16,077
You were great.
You handled those cops like a real pro.

799
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:18,741
You really led them
down the wrong path.

800
00:56:19,784 --> 00:56:23,185
I don't supposeyou can tell me why
the painting I sold you yesterday...

801
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:26,781
ended up in the head
ofsome dead thug.

802
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:30,018
I sold that painting at my gallery.

803
00:56:30,094 --> 00:56:34,053
- Where is your gallery?
- It's down by all the other galleries.

804
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:36,293
- I want to go.
- Now?

805
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:40,133
- Yeah, I want to go now.
- It's closed.

806
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:43,439
- But I assumeyou have a key.
- Yes.

807
00:56:43,508 --> 00:56:45,169
I have a key.

808
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:48,308
No.

809
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,077
- You're not a gallery owner, areyou?
- I don't want to makeyou mad.

810
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:55,142
You have ajob that's
gonna make me mad?

811
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,578
We have to go somewhere private.
Then I'll tell you.

812
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:02,626
We're in my house.
How much more privacy doyou need?

813
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,392
This is private?

814
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,268
I'm sensing something is wrong.

815
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,036
Yes, something is wrong.

816
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:20,134
I've had a pretty crummyweek.

817
00:57:20,211 --> 00:57:24,477
I accidentally killed my boyfriend
because he was cheating on me...

818
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:28,815
and now I found out
thatyou're not an art dealer.

819
00:57:28,886 --> 00:57:32,515
- I can explain.
- Areyou a porn star?

820
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,286
- No!
- Areyou a Republican senator?

821
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,453
Areyou in the Mafia?

822
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:41,153
Yes.

823
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:46,667
Yes, but we're not the Mafia.
We're Irish.

824
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,697
Areyoujoking?

825
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:54,143
I'm a hit man, but I swear I have
never killed a person in my life.

826
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:56,942
That's a good one. You're a hit man
who's never killed anyone?

827
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,610
Doyou think it's easy to admit
I'm a hit man who can't kill?

828
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,016
It's embarrassing.

829
00:58:03,554 --> 00:58:06,216
I hopeyou see the irony here.
I am a hit man, okay?

830
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,123
I have never broken a law
in my entire life...

831
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:11,787
and you, the innocent artist...

832
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,854
just killed her boyfriend!

833
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,434
To compare my murder,
which was an act oflove--

834
00:58:18,503 --> 00:58:21,734
Wait, oflove?
You didn't love Dick.

835
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:24,434
He sure as hell didn't loveyou,
but I do.

836
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:26,801
Do what?

837
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,813
Loveyou. Okay?

838
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:33,680
I loveyou.

839
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:37,553
- You said, ''I loveyou.''
- Yes.

840
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:40,056
I loveyou.

841
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:42,115
There, I said it.
I loveyou.

842
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:44,985
Really?

843
00:58:46,097 --> 00:58:48,998
I dumped a body foryou.
I got rid ofa murderweapon.

844
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,433
Where I'm from,
that's love.

845
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:53,667
I loveyou.

846
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:10,646
Excuse me.

847
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:13,622
I have to go talk
to a wayward relative, okay?

848
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:25,268
What areyou doing?
Get rid ofthat thing.

849
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:28,169
No, listen.
I'm beginning to grow attached to it.

850
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:30,639
I think it has special powers.

851
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:33,370
Just get rid ofit
or I'll kill you.

852
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,537
All right,
it's gonna make Christmas...

853
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,309
real uncomfortable
for the families, huh?

854
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:40,543
Stop being such a dick.

855
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,249
Asshole.

856
00:59:49,227 --> 00:59:50,990
That was fun.

857
00:59:51,062 --> 00:59:53,053
I could do that
every night ofmy life.

858
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,658
That's a nice thought.
It's probably not gonna happen.

859
00:59:56,734 --> 00:59:58,998
I'm in dutch with my boss.

860
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,594
How dutch?

861
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:06,304
- Dutch dutch.
- What's this?

862
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:09,141
They're drug dealers.
Scum ofthe earth.

863
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:11,374
They sell crack
to schoolchildren.

864
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,749
You're supposed to kill them?

865
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,254
Yes.

866
01:00:18,956 --> 01:00:20,947
But I can't do it.

867
01:00:21,025 --> 01:00:23,084
Yes, you can!

868
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,288
Yes, you can.
It's not that hard.

869
01:00:25,363 --> 01:00:27,957
It's likejumping off
the high board.

870
01:00:28,032 --> 01:00:30,432
Youjust have to decide to do it.

871
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,492
Sure, that's easy foryou to say.
You're a natural.

872
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,801
I can't do it.
I'd take the gun, and I'd...

873
01:00:35,873 --> 01:00:39,001
point the gun
and it makes that...

874
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:41,704
horrible exploding sound.

875
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:43,508
That's all right.

876
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:47,210
It's all right.
You're still a good person.

877
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:50,721
AndJared, he's my boss
and he's my brother-in-law.

878
01:00:50,788 --> 01:00:53,279
He threatened to kill me
ifI don't kill these people.

879
01:00:54,058 --> 01:00:57,050
Jeez.
Think he's serious?

880
01:00:57,128 --> 01:01:00,325
I once saw him stab a guy
to death with a soup spoon.

881
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:06,225
We'll just go run away somewhere.
SomewhereJared won't find us.

882
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:09,865
- I have some family money.
- He's gonna find us whereverwe go.

883
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:12,307
I just have to face the fact...

884
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:15,072
that I'vejust got
a few days to live.

885
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:17,740
But I'm gonna make them
the best few days ofyour life.

886
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:20,546
There has to be some way out.

887
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:25,852
I got it.

888
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:28,323
- What?
- I'll doyour hits.

889
01:01:28,392 --> 01:01:30,758
- No.
- Yeah, I'll doyour hits.

890
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,057
I'm not gonna haveyou
do my killing for me.

891
01:01:34,131 --> 01:01:36,258
I'd do anything foryou.

892
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:39,528
Come on, it's the least
I can do foryou.

893
01:01:41,706 --> 01:01:43,230
Come on.

894
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:46,739
I loveyou.

895
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:49,677
Really?

896
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,916
Now, when you kill them,
you have to make sure they're dead.

897
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,981
Yeah, I know.
You told me that already.

898
01:02:01,058 --> 01:02:03,049
Just make sure
to put a bullet in their brain.

899
01:02:03,127 --> 01:02:05,061
You told me that already too.

900
01:02:05,129 --> 01:02:08,530
- And ifanything goes wrong--
- I get the hell out. I know.

901
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,829
All right, give me the gun.

902
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:13,197
Give me the gun.

903
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,535
It has a silencer attached.

904
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,471
So I don't wake up
the whole neighborhood.

905
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,372
All right. I know.

906
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,840
I'll seeyou later.

907
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:24,380
- Colleen.
- Yes?

908
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:27,244
Just be careful.

909
01:02:58,683 --> 01:03:01,846
- Let's go get some dinner.
- What?

910
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:03,784
Maybe Chinese or something?

911
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:06,448
- Were they there?
- Oh, yeah.

912
01:03:06,524 --> 01:03:08,424
Did you--

913
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,984
Oh, yeah.

914
01:03:11,062 --> 01:03:15,123
- Areyou sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

915
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,434
Come on. Let's go.
I'm starving.

916
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:20,197
Whateveryou say.

917
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:36,779
''WallyLemon.:
kiddiepornographer. ''

918
01:04:43,487 --> 01:04:45,478
Is this whereyou put Dick?

919
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:48,886
Yes.

920
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:50,620
It's fitting.

921
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:54,255
- Oh, God!
- What's wrong?

922
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:56,561
Look at my dress.

923
01:04:57,234 --> 01:05:00,863
This is the third good dress
I've ruined doing thisjob.

924
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:03,700
Blood doesn't wash out so easily.

925
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:07,335
Don't worry about it.
We're done. You're done.

926
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,606
That's five.
That's the deal I made withJared.

927
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,170
Good.

928
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:15,543
Nowyou can headline
at the Shillelagh Room...

929
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:18,520
and win the WXI U talent contest.

930
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:20,955
Yes, and we'll be on...

931
01:05:21,826 --> 01:05:23,487
Easy Street.

932
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,635
You know what I think?

933
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:37,435
Would you please stop doing that?

934
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:40,671
I think that day ofreckoning
I was talking about is coming.

935
01:05:40,744 --> 01:05:42,507
I can feel it.

936
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,807
Who is that man?

937
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:47,316
Just a crazy old man.
Let'sjust go.

938
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,176
He's dirty.

939
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,855
It's gonna come.

940
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,168
That's it.

941
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,536
Five.

942
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,476
I'm through.

943
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:14,937
Here's number six.

944
01:06:16,881 --> 01:06:19,679
No,Jared.

945
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,945
You said after five I'm done.

946
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,115
I meant after six.

947
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,282
You know, this whole...

948
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,349
killing thing--

949
01:06:29,426 --> 01:06:32,361
It's really getting on my nerves.

950
01:06:34,064 --> 01:06:36,828
Well, ifthat's the way
you want to play it.

951
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,528
You love Ivy, don'tyou, Danny?

952
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:45,235
What areyou getting at?

953
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,743
Be a shame ifanything
was to happen to her.

954
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,570
Besides, I thought
you'd want this one...

955
01:06:51,615 --> 01:06:55,551
with this being the man that stole
away the lovely Mary's heart.

956
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:00,012
You want me to whack the Tuner?

957
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,526
Tony ''the Tuner'' Moretti
has been muscling in...

958
01:07:03,594 --> 01:07:06,927
on my salmon-poaching racket,
and he has to pay.

959
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:12,467
See, life is fair sometimes,
isn't it, Danny?

960
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:15,662
Just do this last hit.

961
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:17,570
Pick up the envelope.

962
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,438
Saveyour sister.

963
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,985
Daniel, I really loveyou.

964
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:35,787
I just don't know ifI can
keep on killing foryou.

965
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,293
Colleen,just one last hit.

966
01:07:39,964 --> 01:07:41,955
And we're through.
Jared promised.

967
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,958
All right.
What's his name?

968
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:48,400
Tony ''the Tuner'' Moretti.

969
01:07:48,472 --> 01:07:51,600
DidJared tell you
why he wanted him killed?

970
01:07:51,675 --> 01:07:55,111
I don't know why he wants him killed.
Hejust wants him killed.

971
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:57,909
Well,jeez, Daniel...

972
01:07:57,982 --> 01:08:00,212
doyou ever ask any questions?

973
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,616
Ifthey asked you to go
kill your own grandmother...

974
01:08:02,686 --> 01:08:05,211
you thinkyou'd bother to askwhy?

975
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:09,623
- What areyou, a ''question-aholic''?
- What's that supposed to mean?

976
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:15,121
- Hello?
- Danny, this isJared.

977
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:17,997
Yoursisterhadanother
one ofheraccidents.

978
01:08:18,068 --> 01:08:21,299
The doctorsaidshe'dbe fine,
butyoubettercome outhere.

979
01:08:22,172 --> 01:08:23,298
Okay.

980
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:25,899
I'll be there as soon as I can.

981
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:45,155
- Hey, Ivy.
- Doyou love me, Danny?

982
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:47,094
Sure I do.

983
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:49,029
Then killJared.

984
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:57,303
I don't think that would be
a wise career move on my part.

985
01:08:57,374 --> 01:09:00,810
I want him dead, Danny.
He's fooling around behind my back.

986
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:02,539
He wouldn't do that toyou.

987
01:09:02,613 --> 01:09:06,379
Stop taking his side.
He treats you like an idiot.

988
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:11,544
Doyou really think he's gonna
letyou headline at the Shillelagh Room?

989
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,956
How doyou know
he's fooling around on you?

990
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,018
I hired a detective.
Some clown named Rasmusson.

991
01:09:19,096 --> 01:09:22,463
Who's apparently skipped town,
because I can't get ahold ofhim.

992
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,866
Anyway, he mailed me
these pictures...

993
01:09:25,936 --> 01:09:28,962
taken at the Pink Flamingo Motel.

994
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,906
That's when
I took the sleeping pills.

995
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,073
He's doing a nun?

996
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,141
She's not a real nun.

997
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:46,853
According to Rasmusson,Jared likes
to go to this fantasy strip club...

998
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:50,553
and pick up these strippers
who dress in these kinky costumes.

999
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:52,660
All right.

1000
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:54,661
All right.

1001
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,724
I'll do it.
I'll rubJared.

1002
01:09:57,801 --> 01:10:01,897
Danny, that's the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

1003
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:09,978
Would it be fair to say thatyou're not
the best lunch companion right now?

1004
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:14,882
I've been neglecting you.
I know it.

1005
01:10:14,952 --> 01:10:18,115
I'm really sorry. Let's try to enjoy
the rest ofour meal, okay?

1006
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:19,621
Okay.

1007
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:32,767
This is Mary, my old girlfriend.

1008
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:34,599
Yeah, I know.

1009
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:38,437
- Danny, I'm sureyou know the Tuner.
- Hi. Howyou doing?

1010
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:43,104
So doyou want to sit down?

1011
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,478
Wejust ate, butyeah, sure.

1012
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:46,948
What, Tuner?

1013
01:10:47,718 --> 01:10:50,243
Doyou want to go to the restroom?

1014
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,221
You want to use the phone.
Yeah, sure.

1015
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:02,331
The Tuner--

1016
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,358
He's gone to a dark,
secluded part ofthe restaurant.

1017
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,429
Yeah. Alone.

1018
01:11:21,385 --> 01:11:24,752
I guess I'd better powder my nose.

1019
01:11:31,094 --> 01:11:33,187
So, how areyou, Danny?

1020
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:36,662
Great. Fine.
How areyou?

1021
01:11:40,003 --> 01:11:41,994
I can't take it anymore.

1022
01:11:43,307 --> 01:11:45,502
It's so awful
living with the Tuner.

1023
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:48,144
I never understand
a word he says.

1024
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:51,345
He's so violent.

1025
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:54,313
Unlikeyou, Danny.

1026
01:11:54,384 --> 01:11:56,716
You were always so gentle.

1027
01:11:58,622 --> 01:12:01,386
I guess I made a big mistake
when I leftyou.

1028
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,484
- Yep, I guess you did.
- Yeah.

1029
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:08,387
Is there anyway
I can win you back?

1030
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,047
Use the phone?

1031
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,752
No.

1032
01:12:36,827 --> 01:12:38,886
Just be a minute.

1033
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:44,058
I'm sorry.
This is the wrong secluded hallway.

1034
01:12:51,008 --> 01:12:52,635
Sorry, Mary.

1035
01:12:54,044 --> 01:12:56,205
See, I found a really special gal.

1036
01:12:57,814 --> 01:13:00,977
I understand.
I guess this is good-bye, then.

1037
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:05,010
- Yeah.
- I'm moving to Nebraska to find myself.

1038
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:08,014
- Yeah.
- Great, yeah.

1039
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:28,072
Did you--

1040
01:13:28,145 --> 01:13:31,740
No, I didn't,
and I want to go home.

1041
01:13:34,851 --> 01:13:38,014
There'sbeenamisunderstanding.

1042
01:13:38,088 --> 01:13:40,283
There'snomisunderstanding.

1043
01:13:40,357 --> 01:13:43,019
You're leaving, and you're never
coming back as long as you live.

1044
01:13:43,093 --> 01:13:45,721
You're not gonna visit me.

1045
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,560
You're not gonna call me.
You're not even gonna think about me.

1046
01:13:49,566 --> 01:13:53,263
This killing is making you
a little bit temperamental.

1047
01:13:53,337 --> 01:13:57,137
I'm not temperamental, I'm mad.
There's a difference.

1048
01:13:58,842 --> 01:14:02,539
You asked me to kill
your ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.

1049
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:06,942
That's not a normal
relationship request.

1050
01:14:07,017 --> 01:14:09,144
That was a coincidence.

1051
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,187
Yeah, sure.

1052
01:14:11,254 --> 01:14:13,245
Just like the rest ofthem.

1053
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:16,019
You'rejust using me
to get whatyou want.

1054
01:14:17,094 --> 01:14:19,460
I almost trusted you.

1055
01:14:21,798 --> 01:14:24,665
Good-bye, good luck
and get out.

1056
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,133
And Daniel?

1057
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,434
Yes?

1058
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:39,107
I hopeyou do really crummy
at the talent show tonight.

1059
01:14:49,993 --> 01:14:52,826
Hi, I'm sorry to disturbyou, sir,
but did you know...

1060
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:56,923
that the LordJesus Christ
watches your every move?

1061
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,194
Yes.

1062
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:01,965
Yes. You're a brother in the spirit,
just like me.

1063
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:06,840
- Forty-two.
- Psalm 42 is one ofmy favorites too.

1064
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,470
- ''The deer that--''
- Forty-two.

1065
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:13,141
There's 42 dead bodies
buried out there in thatyard.

1066
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:16,242
You know what? Brother, I think
I'm gonna come back tomorrow.

1067
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,083
- There's 42 dead bodies out there.
- Let go ofme.

1068
01:15:19,156 --> 01:15:21,147
- You need to sober up.
- You take me.

1069
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:23,692
No! Let go ofme! Help!

1070
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,751
Let go ofme, you fat retard!

1071
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:31,194
That's it, hurt me!

1072
01:15:31,268 --> 01:15:33,998
Spank me!
Call me Cheesy-weezy!

1073
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,402
Come on!

1074
01:15:36,273 --> 01:15:39,572
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Danny, what areyou doing here?

1075
01:15:39,643 --> 01:15:42,339
Now I see whyyou wanted
Dick Rasmusson killed.

1076
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,011
All right, Danny.
I'll giveyou $2,000 not to tell Ivy.

1077
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:50,611
Whatyou don't understand is you're
just my boss, but Ivy's my sister.

1078
01:15:51,288 --> 01:15:52,778
Oh, my God!

1079
01:15:52,856 --> 01:15:55,051
- Put the gun away, Danny.
- No.

1080
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:56,956
Danny, I orderyou.
Put the gun--

1081
01:15:57,027 --> 01:15:59,291
You always told me the one
with the gun gave the orders.

1082
01:15:59,362 --> 01:16:01,990
- Oh, my God. He's gonna kill us.
- No, he's not.

1083
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:03,726
He doesn't have the guts.

1084
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,134
- That's whatyou think.
- You can kill him,just don't kill me.

1085
01:16:08,205 --> 01:16:10,196
- I'm premed.
- Shut up!

1086
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:13,838
What is the deal
with crossing guards?

1087
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:16,401
They're the sirens
ofthe school system.

1088
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,071
You know what
your problem is,Jared?

1089
01:16:19,149 --> 01:16:21,208
You can't see what's
right in front ofyou.

1090
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:24,481
What's right in front ofme,
Danny, is a dead man.

1091
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:27,489
I'm talking about love.
Ivy loved you!

1092
01:16:27,557 --> 01:16:30,651
- Who's Ivy?
- Shut up! Love is a rare thing,Jared.

1093
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:32,991
You ought to hold onto it
when you get an opportunity.

1094
01:16:33,063 --> 01:16:35,224
What the hell
areyou talking about?

1095
01:16:35,298 --> 01:16:38,597
I'm talking about killing you.
And her!

1096
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:46,767
Go on. Pull the trigger.
You don't have the guts. Go on!

1097
01:16:46,843 --> 01:16:49,004
- I will.
- Do it!

1098
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:51,070
- I will.
- Go ahead!

1099
01:16:54,751 --> 01:16:57,447
I knewyou didn't have the guts.

1100
01:16:57,521 --> 01:16:59,352
Who's been making your hits?

1101
01:17:30,954 --> 01:17:33,821
- We're back.
- You remember us.

1102
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,859
- Ofcourse I rememberyou.
- We got an anonymous tip.

1103
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:38,588
From some guy.

1104
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:42,460
So I guess Daniel did find
a way to get back at me.

1105
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:43,965
Excuse me?

1106
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,399
Nothing.

1107
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:49,370
- This tip led us to ajunkyard.
- Ajunkyard with 42 bodies in it.

1108
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,636
- All dead.
- One ofthem was Dick Rasmusson.

1109
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:56,475
- A PI.
- And one punch short ofa free latte.

1110
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:59,174
Sad, really.
And his death too.

1111
01:17:59,249 --> 01:18:01,046
But here's where
the story gets weird.

1112
01:18:01,117 --> 01:18:03,210
A few days ago, me and Murphy
were in a strip bar.

1113
01:18:03,286 --> 01:18:05,880
- We get horny like everyone else.
- And we meet this PI.

1114
01:18:05,956 --> 01:18:08,550
- A real clown named Rasmusson.
- Said he had a gal.

1115
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,719
- A gal named Colleen.
- A gal he was going to marry.

1116
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:13,589
What?

1117
01:18:13,663 --> 01:18:16,393
Ofcourse, we didn't put
two and two together until after 5:00.

1118
01:18:16,466 --> 01:18:18,229
And that's quitting time.

1119
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:20,531
You don't seem real surprised
that Dick's dead.

1120
01:18:20,604 --> 01:18:22,231
I am surprised.

1121
01:18:24,975 --> 01:18:26,704
I'm just shocked.

1122
01:18:26,776 --> 01:18:29,006
Don'tyou think it's strange
that one day some mob goon...

1123
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,070
is killed byyour painting,
and the next day...

1124
01:18:31,147 --> 01:18:34,048
we're digging the body ofyour fianc
out ofa pile ofpop cans?

1125
01:18:34,784 --> 01:18:36,376
There's even more.

1126
01:18:36,453 --> 01:18:40,219
We found this punk sink salesman
shot to death in the park.

1127
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:43,020
And the slug the lab pulled out ofhim
matched the slug in the PI.

1128
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,788
We haven't found the gun.

1129
01:18:46,463 --> 01:18:48,693
I thinkithas specialpowers.

1130
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,803
Don'tscrewitup.

1131
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,906
Oh, man.

1132
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:23,756
Two bodies. One gun.

1133
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:25,824
That's whywe want
to search your house.

1134
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:28,132
Well, you'll need a search warrant.

1135
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:37,702
First place we check in any suspicious
murder case is the basement.

1136
01:19:37,781 --> 01:19:40,181
All novice killers hide
theirvictims in the basement.

1137
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,014
- Some psychological thing, like burial.
- I think it symbolizes hell.

1138
01:19:43,086 --> 01:19:46,078
It's burial.
Hey, cool, a guitar!

1139
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,522
This thing's out oftune.

1140
01:19:52,195 --> 01:19:54,493
Probably has something to do
with this bullet hole in the back.

1141
01:19:54,564 --> 01:19:58,022
That would do it.
Hey, there's blood on this guitar.

1142
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:01,468
- A little vinegarwould take that out.
- I'd use dish soap.

1143
01:20:01,538 --> 01:20:03,836
I hear the teakettle boiling.

1144
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:13,306
That was a door locking,
wasn't it?

1145
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:15,749
Yeah. I think so.

1146
01:20:35,905 --> 01:20:38,032
Did you do it?
Did you kill him?

1147
01:20:38,108 --> 01:20:39,735
Not quite.

1148
01:20:39,809 --> 01:20:42,141
But I detained him...

1149
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:45,409
and when he wakes up...

1150
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:48,474
he's gonna be pissed.

1151
01:20:48,551 --> 01:20:50,348
Soyou gotta get out oftown.

1152
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:54,254
- Two tickets to Rome.
- Areyou coming with me?

1153
01:20:54,324 --> 01:20:57,782
No, I'm going to the talent show
to sing my heart out.

1154
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:01,194
Then I'm gonna find the woman I love
and ask her to marry me.

1155
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,908
Good-bye, Daniel Gallagher.

1156
01:21:29,025 --> 01:21:31,084

- Isn't that Daniel Gallagher?
- One ofJared O'Reilly's boys.

1190
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:40,405
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

1191
01:24:40,483 --> 01:24:42,974
Let's arrest him
and ask questions later.

1192
01:24:43,052 --> 01:24:45,577
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1193
01:24:45,655 --> 01:24:47,418
It's ''Danny Boy.''

01:25:23,192 --> 01:25:26,423
So then I discover that not only
does he want me to bump off...

1202
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:30,933
his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend,
he's gonna turn me over to the cops.

1203
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,900
Probably so he can, you know...

1204
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:36,097
live happily ever after
with his angel, Mary.

1205
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,002
- Wow, that does suck.
- See, I told you.

1209
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,722
Thankyou very much.

1210
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:05,493
Well, that's the big finish.
I better go plug him.

1211
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:09,531
Thankyou very much.

1212
01:26:09,605 --> 01:26:14,167
That song is dedicated
to the woman I love.

1213
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:16,803
- Yeah, Mary.
- Colleen Gibson.

1214
01:26:22,418 --> 01:26:24,648
Keepyour metal
in your pockets, boys.

1215
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:28,020
I'm only here for one chicken.
Oh, Danny boy.

1216
01:26:28,925 --> 01:26:31,519
You can sing,
butyou sure can't kill.

1217
01:26:31,594 --> 01:26:35,724
I knewyou never made any ofthose hits,
starting with Dick Rasmusson.

1218
01:26:38,468 --> 01:26:40,698
Say hello to Saint Patrick.

1219
01:26:43,606 --> 01:26:45,198
Who areyou?

1220
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:48,711
I'm Colleen Gibson.

1221
01:26:49,378 --> 01:26:51,243
And I'm a hit man.

1222
01:26:51,314 --> 01:26:54,112
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Sorry about that.

1223
01:26:54,183 --> 01:26:57,346
And I'm a very,
very dangerous woman.

1224
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:05,219
-Jared O'Reilly, you're under arrest.
- For the murder of Dick Rasmusson.

1225
01:27:05,294 --> 01:27:07,057
I didn't kill Dick Rasmusson.

1226
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,894
He did kill Dick Rasmusson.
He told me so himself.

1227
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,729
A confession.

1228
01:27:12,802 --> 01:27:16,067
No, no, wait a minute.
I killed Dick Rasmusson.

1229
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:20,235
- I'm a very dangerous hit man!
- She didn't kill anyone.

1230
01:27:20,309 --> 01:27:22,140
- She's nothing.
- Oh, yeah?

1231
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:24,304
I've done it before.
What's one more?

1232
01:27:26,349 --> 01:27:29,375
- What areyou so angry about?
- Well, for one, there's Mary.

1233
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:32,012
- That's a nice place to start.
- She means nothing to me.

1234
01:27:32,088 --> 01:27:35,421
Besides, she moved
to Nebraska to find herself.

1235
01:27:36,759 --> 01:27:39,421
All right, but there's also...

1236
01:27:39,495 --> 01:27:43,454
the anonymous tip the police got
about the bodies in the dump.

1237
01:27:43,533 --> 01:27:47,902
Sorry to interrupt, but the anonymous
tip was from a guy named Hurley.

1238
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,302
Okay, so I guessed wrong
on that one.

1239
01:27:50,373 --> 01:27:53,433
All right, O'Reilly.
Down to the station house with you.

1240
01:27:54,544 --> 01:27:56,239
What happened toyour eye?

1241
01:27:56,312 --> 01:28:00,271
I was ironing a shirt,
and someone telephoned me.

1242
01:28:00,349 --> 01:28:03,318
I would never turn you in.
I loveyou.

1243
01:28:03,386 --> 01:28:06,082
- You don't love me.
- I do loveyou.

1244
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:07,986
IfI didn't loveyou,
would I giveyou this?

1245
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:12,120
It's not a gun.

1246
01:28:18,134 --> 01:28:21,433
Colleen Gibson,
will you marry me?

1247
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,335
Should I kill you...

1248
01:28:30,413 --> 01:28:31,937
or marryyou?

1249
01:28:32,014 --> 01:28:34,744
- Marry him!
- Marry me.

1250
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:37,877
I loveyou.
I honestly loveyou.

1251
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:41,412
You said the most important thing
in the world is trust.

1252
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:45,517
It's what every relationship is made of.
You gotta trust me on this.

1253
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:49,554
I loveyou.
I loveyou with all my heart, Colleen.

1254
01:28:53,236 --> 01:28:55,227
You gotta believe.

1255
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:05,905
I wasn't really gonna kill you.
I wasjust really mad.

1256
01:29:05,982 --> 01:29:07,745
That's understandable.

1257
01:29:07,817 --> 01:29:10,752
And the winner is Daniel Gallagher.

1258
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,617
I won!

1259
01:29:16,993 --> 01:29:18,756
Thankyou.
Thankyou.

1260
01:29:23,599 --> 01:29:27,433
That's our show.
WXI U, I'm Dash Davis.

1261
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:30,430
I parked out back
for the quick getaway.

1262
01:29:30,506 --> 01:29:34,966
Colleen! Greatjob.
I am so proud ofyou.

1263
01:29:35,645 --> 01:29:39,012
You know, you really do have
a gift for this whole killing thing.

1264
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:40,639
I know!

1265
01:29:45,021 --> 01:29:47,888
Maybeyou could directyour talents
in otherways, though.

1266
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:51,825
You know?
Something more artistic, less deadly.

1267
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:01,426
- How about opening a dress shop?
- No.

1268
01:30:01,504 --> 01:30:03,529
I want to fence stolen goods.

1269
01:30:03,606 --> 01:30:06,439
- People always like a good soap store.
- Numbers running!

1270
01:30:06,509 --> 01:30:08,670
- Flower stall?
- Racketeering?

1271
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:11,679
- Doyou even know what racketeering is?
- No, what is it?

1272
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:14,341
I don't know.
Anyway, no more killing.

1273
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:17,386
- But I'm good at it.
- No more killing!

1274
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:20,149
Okay, no more killing.

1275
01:30:20,222 --> 01:30:22,213
How about extortion?
