1
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,973
    Summer.

2
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,808
    Honey.

3
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,476
                You may approach
                the bench.

4
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,844
We're nearly there.

5
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,147
Do you want
the hummus sandwich
I made you?

6
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,581
                I told you
                I'm not hungry.

7
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,582
It's vegan.

8
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,818
    Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,587
    we expect to land
    in about 15 minutes.

10
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,923
    Thank you for flying
    with Alitalia,

11
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,826
and we hope to see you
again in the near future

12
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,528
 onboard our flights.
<i> Arrivederci.</i>

13
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,664
Summer, look.

14
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,201
        Wait. They have
        geological formations
        in Europe, too?

15
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,670
Look, honey,
there's nothing

16
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,772
you can do for him
right now, OK?

17
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,441
So in the meantime,
you have 2 weeks

18
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,844
to just simply relax.

19
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,512
And I'm telling you,

20
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,514
you're gonna love
this country,

21
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,683
the people, the food,
the gelato.

22
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,685
        I should be
        by Tyler's side
        fighting for his rights,

23
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,687
        and you're trying
        to buy me off
        with ice cream?

24
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,022
        This is about injustice.

25
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,723
There's injustice here,
too, trust me.

26
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,292
                Oh, I'm pleased.

27
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,528
No, seriously,
this country is, like,
famously corrupt.

28
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,197
They have fascism,
social inequality.

29
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,399
People are eating
out of garbage cans.

30
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,301
        I thought you said
        the food was good.

31
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,703
It is. It--It's so good

32
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,941
that people are eating it
out of the garbage cans.

33
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,546
All I know is
that when I was your age,

34
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,215
I loved being here.

35
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,883
        When you were my age,
        you were a virgin

36
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:38,884
        with a Prozac
        dependency.

37
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,552
That's not true.

38
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,654
        Yeah, I've seen
        the photos of the zits
        and the braces.

39
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,089
That was
junior high school.

40
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,891
And actually,
when I was here,

41
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,161
I had a boyfriend,
and he was very handsome.

42
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:14,086
¶ Someone to watch over me ¶

43
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:19,291
    ¶ I couldn't ask you
    for more ¶

44
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,926
¶ Oh oh,
oh oh, oh oh ¶

45
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:27,432
    ¶ Why do I long
    to be free ¶

46
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:34,106
    ¶ But cry when you
    walk out the door? ¶

47
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,943
¶ You got me going round
like a record now ¶

48
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,380
    ¶ I wanna show my love,
    but I don't know how ¶

49
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,881
¶ I know that I'm a mess ¶

50
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:46,285
¶ But I pray
you'll stick around... ¶

51
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,655
        I got it. I got it.
        Thank you.

52
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,658
        Check the tag. The tag.
        Check the tag.

53
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,825
        That's mine.

54
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,993
        Oh.
                    Hey.

55
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,328
    Oh, is this yours?

56
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,462
                    Yes.
        I'm sorry.

57
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,131
        Looks--Take it.

58
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,799
                    OK.
Looks like my old bag.

59
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,504
¶ Take me to your treetops
growing up... ¶

60
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,673
            Excuse me. It looks
            like my old one.

61
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,874
            Sorry.

62
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,245
        Come on, little duck.

63
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,581
¶ But we'll both go slow ¶

64
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,819
    ¶ Ooh, ooh ooh ooh,
    ooh ooh ooh ¶

65
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,256
    ¶ Ooh, ooh ooh ooh,
    ooh ooh ooh ¶

66
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,591
            <i> Signorina, scusi.</i>
            <i> Per favore.</i>

67
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,561
        Oh, you've gotta
        be kidding me.

68
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,438
                Can I have
                your passport,
                please?

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,405
            Sure.

70
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,780
            Purpose of visit?
I'm being kidnapped...

71
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,116
    We're on vacation.
by my own mother.

72
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,718
    She's making a joke.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,219
            Wait a second,
            please.

74
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,021
        Jesus, Summer.

75
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,022
    Mm?

76
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,124
        Take your glasses off.

77
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,194
                    Yeah?

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,899
            Do you have
            any criminal record?

79
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,703
        N-No, and she's
        not about to get one
        right now, either.

80
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,905
You just lied
to an agent of the law.

81
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,207
        It's a juvenile record.

82
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,042
        It's in the process
        of being expunged,

83
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,044
        and it's really just
        an administrative
        thing now.

84
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,379
You told an untruth.

85
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,980
        Well, technically
        I did not.

86
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,387
                Ah. See?

87
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,623
            Ah, it's so relaxing
            in Italy.

88
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,260
            People are
            so laid-back.

89
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,430
        Ah,<i> buongiorno.</i>

90
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,232
        <i> Buongiorno. Ciao.</i>

91
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,067
            Hello. I have a--

92
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,570
            <i> una--una</i>
            <i> reservazione.</i>

93
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,906
Just have to...

94
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,941
            find the number.

95
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,511
            But I know
            it's under the name
            Mrs. Falk.

96
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,512
            Marg--Well, Maggie.

97
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,679
        Yes.
                Maggie.

98
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,248
    I will need
    the reservation number.

99
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,183
            Yes, but I also
            have the, um--

100
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,118
        That's the credit card
        that I booked on.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,453
    I'm sorry.
    No number, no booking.

102
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,755
            Come on.
            What's a little--

103
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,358
            What's
            a little number
            between<i> amici,</i> huh?

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,693
             I'm sure
             you can scrounge up

105
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,431
            a little
            convertible,
            you know, um...

106
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,600
            <i> una Fiat bella.</i>

107
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,436
            <i> Tutto e bellissima.</i>

108
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,437
    I'm sorry.

109
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,942
That is the least
<i> bellissima</i> car ever.

110
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,943
That is
antique<i> bellissima.</i>

111
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:25,944
            It's eighties.

112
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,279
            You love
            the eighties.

113
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,281
The eighties revival
is totally over.

114
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,284
            Well, can't you
            like it ironically

115
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,286
            or whatever it is
            you kids do?

116
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,288
The irony revival
is totally over, too.

117
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,523
You have to like things
sincerely now.

118
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,026
                Mm.

119
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,728
            I like it sincerely.

120
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,135
            On the road,
            just the two of us,

121
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,671
            sisters doing it
            for ourselves.

122
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,738
Ah, seriously.

123
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,907
        "Thelma and Louise."

124
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,676
Thelma and Louise
drove off a cliff
and killed themselves.

125
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:58,977
Oh! God!

126
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,978
            Sorry.

127
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,180
    Yep, super relaxed here.

128
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,316
    Unlike Dad's new pile
    in the Hamptons,

129
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,318
    where I should
    totally be instead.

130
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,652
        Last time
        you stayed with him,

131
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,020
        he took you
        out drinking.

132
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,157
I try to see him taking me
as an act of trust.

133
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,825
            Oh, God.
            Please don't tell me

134
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,827
            what his
            less trustworthy
            acts are.

135
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,163
    Exactly. I won't.
    I'm not telling you
    anything about anything,

136
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,165
     which is why you don't know
     anything about my life

137
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,600
    and you keep trying
    to protect me

138
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,169
from things I don't need
to be protected from.

139
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,170
        Is your seat belt on?

140
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,271
    Yes.

141
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,859
Tranquility.

142
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,861
Yep, pure tranquility

143
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,731
with Tyler unjustly rotting
in the penal system.

144
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,133
            Ah, brother.

145
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,536
It's a harmless
medicinal herb.

146
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:02,207
5 kilos
   of a harmless
   medicinal herb.

147
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,310
        Marijuana laws are
        a tool for the state

148
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,711
        to oppress
        the underclass.

149
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,480
            Underclass?
            His mother owns
            a gallery

150
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,881
            on the Upper
            East Side.

151
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,882
You're so racist!

152
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,484
            He's white!

153
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,252
No, he's not.
He's 1/8 Native American.

154
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,387
There was a genocide.

155
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,222
        Summer, honey, baby,

156
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,891
        I just don't want you
        dragged into this.

157
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,561
        He wants you
        to pretend that they
        were your drugs.

158
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,896
He never asked me
to do that.

159
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,398
        Well, that's not
        the impression you gave.

160
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,934
        The impression you gave
        is that he wants you

161
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,570
        to go back
        on your deposition,
        to perjure yourself,

162
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,406
        and to say that it
        was you all along.

163
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,074
No! I was speaking
hypothetically.

164
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,777
If I took the rap,
it'd just be
a juvenile sentence,

165
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,278
which doesn't count,
technically speaking.

166
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,013
        Do you have any idea
        how hard it was

167
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,415
        to get your record
        for theft overturned?

168
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,017
It wasn't theft.
It was liberation.

169
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,786
Those rabbits
needed to be free.

170
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,855
        Summer, Summer,
        this is drug dealing.
        It would be perjury,

171
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,358
        and it would
        look awful on your
        college application.

172
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,359
I hate you!

173
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,794
        I know you do.
        I know you do.

174
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,762
Summer. Whoa, Summer!

175
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,298
Get off!

176
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,866
        Don't--That's not safe.
    Ow!

177
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,368
        That's really dangerous!
Ow! My foot's stuck!

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,703
            I don't care.

179
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,272
You're so controlling!

180
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,678
No wonder Dad left you...

181
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,450
for his 23-year-old
legal secretary
called Amber.

182
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,884
        I'm sorry. What, honey?
Whatever.

183
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,988
Just give me my bag.
I need my phone.

184
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,556
Give me my bag!

185
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,196
Fine.
I'll get it myself.

186
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,409
Where's my stupid phone?

187
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,045
    Aah!

188
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,154
            Oh, honey, look.

189
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,590
It's--Wow.

190
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,392
            It's gotta be here
            somewhere.

191
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,565
    I'm sorry.
    Sorry, sorry.

192
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,237
            Where the hell's
            my phone?

193
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,008
        Oh, sorry, Ms. lady,
        but we're almost there.

194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,176
            Sorry.

195
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,688
        Wow.
        It's exactly the same.

196
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,357
        20 years
        in the blink of an eye.

197
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,797
                Ohh.

198
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,766
            It's really
            something, isn't it?

199
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,772
                Oh.

200
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,143
Where is it?

201
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,712
        Where's what?
        Oh, you know what?

202
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,247
        I have to remember
        to write to Uncle George

203
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,382
        and thank him--
My cell phone,

204
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,883
which I strongly
suspect you stole.

205
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,920
        Well, that would be
        very uncharacteristic
        of me.

206
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,922
        I am someone
        people steal from.

207
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,390
Give it to me!

208
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,392
        I don't have it.

209
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,460
            Gosh.

210
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,663
            Oh, calm dow--

211
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,398
            Calm down.
Please!

212
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,599
            I don't have it.

213
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,267
    Give it to me!
                I don't...

214
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,502
<i> Buongiorno.</i>

215
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,504
You rented
the cottage
from George?

216
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,906
I live opposite, so...

217
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,842
            Luca?

218
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,744
    Maggie?

219
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,745
        I thought--

220
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,580
        I thought
        you moved to France.

221
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,014
I moved back.

222
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,951
I bought the old farm,
the villa.

223
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:33,952
        The big villa?

224
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,587
                This cannot
                be happening.

225
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,088
She must be your sister?

226
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,089
                She wishes.

227
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,959
        This is--
        This is Summer.

228
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:41,960
        She's my daughter.

229
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,928
Your daughter.

230
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,601
I can't believe this.

231
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,803
        I know.
        Me neither. It's--

232
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,775
May I invite you
for a drink in--
in my garden?

233
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,143
        Oh, that's--
        that's very nice,

234
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,811
        but we just got here,

235
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,813
        and we haven't
        even unpacked, and--

236
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,114
I understand.

237
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,049
But if you change
your mind,

238
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,851
you are very welcome.

239
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,622
    Bye.

240
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,724
                Bye.

241
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,293
                Ma.

242
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,294
                Ma!

243
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,295
        Yep?

244
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,631
                Is he
                why we're here?

245
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,499
        No.

246
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,002
    No, no, God, no. I--

247
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,005
    I had no idea.
    I thought he moved away.

248
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,740
                You knew
                he was back.

249
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:32,310
    I haven't thought of him
    in 20 years.

250
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,012
                Yeah, right.

251
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,213
            Sheez.

252
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,567
                    Yo.

253
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,202
Oh, my God.
Tyler, you're out.

254
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,303
You made bail?

255
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,873
            Didn't you, uh,
            get my text?

256
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,908
My--My mom's such a bitch.

257
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,211
I think she stole my phone.
How crazy is that?

258
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,380
            Babe, you have got
            to get back here.

259
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,316
            If you don't
            get back and take
            the rap for this,

260
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,818
            I am going down,

261
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,486
            like down to a place

262
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,556
            even lower down
            than, like,
            Chinatown low.

263
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,992
I know,
but it's complicated.

264
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,393
        Complicated is
        how I'm gonna feel...

265
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,928
    Tyler.
        if I go down for this.

266
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,431
I'll try and
get home, OK? I--

267
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,235
I love you, Tyler.

268
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,737
                    Stop it.

269
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,238
                    You do?

270
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,075
I'll find a way.

271
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,911
I promise.

272
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:13,912
                OK.

273
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,973
            Maybe we should go
            say hello, you know?

274
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,875
            Might seem rude
            not to.

275
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,779
            You settling in?

276
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,147
        Mm-hmm.

277
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,148
It's nice, isn't it?

278
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,349
                Yeah.

279
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,624
        Oh, see? This must
        be his pottery.

280
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,028
        It's pretty colors.

281
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,397
            Wow.

282
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,470
                    Hey.
            Hey.

283
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,372
                You came
                after all.

284
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,177
            Come. Let me
            offer you something.

285
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,580
        Oh, no. I mean,
        you don't need to go
        to any trouble.

286
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,681
            Ah, come on.
            I insist.

287
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,717
    You are my guests.
    Come on.

288
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,152
Wow.

289
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,654
                The villa.
    The villa, yes.

290
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,588
                The villa.

291
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,492
                So...

292
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,830
            you married--
            What was it? Jock?

293
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,164
Jack. Jack.
                Oh, Jack.

294
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,166
    I'm happy
    everything worked out.

295
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,167
            I mean, actually,
            we were--

296
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,703
we were divorced
last year,

297
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,772
so i-it didn't...

298
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,440
                I'm sorry
                to hear that.

299
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,075
No, no, no.
It's OK.

300
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,713
                Just--
Please, sit down.

301
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,348
            I'll bring some food

302
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,883
            and something
            to drink.

303
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,184
            Wine, that's OK?

304
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,352
        Sure. Sure.

305
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,454
                    Amarone?

306
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,556
Oh.

307
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,091
        <i> Grazie.</i>
                    <i> Prego.</i>

308
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,368
"Actually, we were
divorced last year."

309
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,704
"Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, baby."

310
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,905
                    What?

311
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,206
                    No.

312
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,308
                Honey, no. No.

313
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,710
                He's--

314
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,145
            he's being polite.

315
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,546
By sexing you?

316
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,914
Ah.

317
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,083
            I'm fairly certain
            he isn't,

318
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,886
            and, um,
            sexing people

319
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,789
            is a form
            of politeness here.

320
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,226
                <i> Ciao.</i>

321
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,062
        <i> Ciao.</i>

322
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,897
                    Ah.

323
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,232
                    This is
                    my darling
                    Valentina.

324
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,001
            Maggie and Summer.

325
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,571
I will
   wake Mamma as well

326
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,673
            so she can meet you.
            You remember Carmen?

327
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,412
        <i> Non è possibile.</i>

328
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,852
            <i> Grazie, Antonio.</i>

329
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,931
            <i> Grazie, Antonio.</i>

330
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,603
    It gets worse and worse.

331
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,338
            And now she tries
            to run away.

332
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,774
            Lucky she
            does not drive,

333
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,275
            otherwise,
            I would have to lock

334
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,844
            the garage as well.

335
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,948
    <i> Buongiorno, Carmen.</i>

336
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,518
        Her memory
        is not so good.

337
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,693
        Excuse me one second.

338
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,141
    <i> Sei l'Americana.</i>

339
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,542
                <i> Sì.</i>

340
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,044
            <i> Sì, l'Americana.</i>

341
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,015
                <i> Ciao.</i>

342
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,049
            <i> Ciao.</i>

343
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,424
    Well, it's wonderful to see
    how your art has developed.

344
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,494
            Oh, no, these pieces
            are just rustic
            for tourists.

345
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,164
            In the village,
            I have a small shop.

346
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,199
             In Firenze,
             I have a gallery.

347
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,835
"Fine Art Ceramics."

348
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,838
        For collectors with
        more money than sense.

349
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,443
            Would you like
            to see my studio?

350
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,279
    Oh, we should probably
    head back, right?

351
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,713
No, no. You go ahead.

352
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,782
I'll watch Mamma for you.

353
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,785
    All right, I'll just take
    a very fast look around, OK?

354
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,528
        Where's the garage?

355
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,199
        Whatever, dude.
        I'll find it myself.

356
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,708
                    Whoa.
My studio.

357
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,310
                Incredible.

358
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,811
Do you like it?

359
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,646
            Yeah, it's--

360
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,281
            it's fantastic.

361
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,422
    Ah, yes,
    the trophy wall.

362
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,594
            I draw inspiration
            from all kinds
            of people.

363
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,829
    But largely female
    and attractive.

364
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,266
            You are really
            living the dream.

365
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:36,934
Sure, I do.

366
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,669
And the journalism?

367
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,605
            Journalism? Mm.

368
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,074
        I teach journalism...
Mm.

369
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,775
        at city college.

370
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,912
        You know, just between
        now and, um,

371
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,580
        my next Pulitzer.

372
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,748
Of course.

373
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,687
So you have the career,

374
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,356
a wonderful daughter--

375
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,458
        I have
        a wonderful daughter

376
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,461
        with radical
        anarchist leanings.

377
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,463
            And I, um--

378
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,031
            I have
            an ex-husband

379
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:10,968
        who has lawyered himself
        out of his alimony,

380
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,138
        and, uh, whatever
        meager free time I have

381
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,109
        I spend perfecting
        my online sudoku game.

382
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,110
    Oh.

383
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,350
                    Awesome.

384
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,328
            You help me,
            I help you.

385
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,629
Whatever, Grandma.

386
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,997
Let's get out of here.

387
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,166
        Those are
        pretty colors.

388
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,468
Ah.

389
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,737
            This is great.

390
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,509
            Maggie.
        Sweet.

391
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,911
            I just wanted
            to say that,

392
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,079
            after all
            these years,

393
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,981
            I'm very happy
            to see you again.

394
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,149
Oh!

395
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,152
                Oh, my God.
    It's OK. It's OK.

396
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,653
It's OK. Maggie.
    Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.

397
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,654
I'm so sorry.

398
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:05,890
    My God.

399
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,997
                    Summer!

400
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,265
    She took my mamma.

401
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,667
        I don't under--
        Where are they going?

402
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,202
I don't know. Call her.

403
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,005
            I can't call her.
            She doesn't
            have a phone.

404
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,606
A teenage girl
with no phone?

405
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:26,010
            I--I sort of
            confiscated it.

406
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,278
You stole her phone?

407
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,346
Let me drive.

408
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,348
    No, no.
    I'm OK to drive.

409
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,615
            Are you sure?
    Yes.

410
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,458
            I hope Mamma
            can take all this.

411
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
            You know her heart
            is not very strong.

412
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,861
        I'm sorry.
        It's my fault.

413
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,197
What's wrong
with your daughter, anyway?

414
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,865
            Like I said,
            it's complicated.

415
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,034
        Her boyfriend is
        in trouble for drugs,

416
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,370
        and he wants her
        to take the blame.

417
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,637
        He wants to use her.

418
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,909
        She's easily led.

419
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,212
            <i> Grazie.</i>

420
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,546
        They've left
        the village,

421
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,215
        took off
        to the west.

422
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,384
            All right, so
            she's heading back
            to the airport,

423
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,986
so we'll just
meet her there, right?
Can you hand me my bag?

424
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,221
Can you just get
the passports?

425
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,389
                    Here?
They're in my purse, yeah.

426
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,723
                Just get
                the passports.

427
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,395
There is
only one passport.

428
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,563
                What?
Yeah. I think it's yours.

429
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,665
            Well, you just--
OK, but--

430
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,403
No. No.

431
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,737
            My credit card's
            missing.

432
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,439
OK, let me drive.

433
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,074
            Her passport's gone,
            and my credit card's
            missing.

434
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,742
            No, I can drive!
OK, let me drive.

435
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,310
You control
the passports and...

436
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,750
            I'll drop you
            at the next place.

437
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,085
<i> Devo andare a Roma.</i>

438
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,087
        I'm not going
        to Rome, dearie.

439
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,022
        Trust me, I'm going
        straight to NYC.

440
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,791
            <i> Aeroporto.</i>

441
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,592
    Roma.
            <i> Aeroporto.</i>

442
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,294
    Roma.

443
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,163
        <i> Aeroporto,</i> comrade.

444
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,366
    Roma!

445
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,537
            You psycho!
            You broke my face!

446
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,439
            This is my face
            you broke!

447
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,506
    Seat belt.

448
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,613
        Hold on.
        That's airport, right,

449
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,781
        <i> "aeroporto"?</i>
         To the right.

450
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:11,882
            Yeah, yeah, yeah.
        No?

451
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:12,883
            But my mother,
            God bless,

452
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,452
            she wants
            to go to Rome.

453
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,454
    Well, my daughter,
    God bless her,
    occupied Wall Street.

454
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,222
    I tell you, they're
    going to the airport.

455
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,624
You know, your daughter
will give in to my mamma,

456
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,460
and they will go to Rome.
Please.

457
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,062
        Wow. Now you know
        my daughter better
        than I know my daughter.

458
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,997
Insofar as it is
truly possible--

459
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,732
        I just meant that as
        a rhetorical question.

460
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,134
Rhetorical question,
it is Italian, so...

461
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,802
        Listen to me.
        I am 100% positive

462
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,371
        they are going
        to the airport.

463
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:39,310
    You wanna go
    to the airport
    or to Rome?

464
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,911
            You must feel
            pretty freaking good
            about yourself.

465
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:41,879
    Yes.

466
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,835
            I think we should
            call the police.

467
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:05,836
        No.

468
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,004
Why not?

469
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,175
        Look, she's a good kid.

470
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,011
        I just don't want her
        to get in trouble again.

471
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,013
She had run-ins
with the police before?

472
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,348
            No, no, no.

473
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,350
        Well, yes, but...

474
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,685
        I mean, it wasn't
        anything, you know--

475
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,686
        It wasn't serious.

476
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,624
        She just liberated
        some rabbits,

477
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,292
        you know,
        for ethical reasons.

478
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,360
    Oh.

479
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,462
From an experimental
laboratory?

480
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,064
        Well, from a pet store,

481
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,533
        but the conditions
        were dep--

482
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,368
        Look, they'll stop soon,
        right?

483
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,538
        I mean, they'll get
        hungry, and you guys
        have siesta, right?

484
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,705
        So they'll just...

485
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,374
This plan sucks.

486
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,144
                Wow.

487
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,901
            Look.
            There's a snack bar
            up ahead.

488
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,169
            I reckon we've
            got some distance,

489
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,571
            and I could really
            use a coffee.

490
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,916
First time in Italy?

491
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,351
            Yep. Uh-huh.

492
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,953
You like it?

493
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,254
        It's everything
        I dreamed of.

494
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,463
You staying
for long time?

495
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,532
        No, as a matter of fact.

496
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:44,201
        I'd like
        to get out of here
        as quickly as possible.

497
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,436
        Do you think
        you can check

498
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,937
        when the next flight
        to New York leaves?

499
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,772
        On your computer.

500
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:49,873
    Please. It's important.

501
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,484
Ah, we've lost them.

502
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,287
        No, no, no. Trust me.
        Take that small road.

503
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,822
                What, that one?

504
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,223
Yeah, that one.
                    Why?

505
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,891
        Because it's quicker.
        Turn. Turn.

506
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:08,959
I am.

507
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,728
        Yeah, we will have
        the advantage.

508
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,729
    OK.

509
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,903
                Voilà.

510
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,871
                Or whatever.

511
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,077
        <i> Arrivederci,</i> grandma!

512
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,153
What the...

513
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,336
    Roma.

514
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,671
                Fine.

515
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,006
            Rome first, and then
            I'll fly from there.

516
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,007
                Deal?

517
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,428
            How far is it
            to Rome, anyway?

518
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,532
    300<i> chilometri.</i>

519
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,901
            300 kilometers?
            It'll be the middle
            of the night

520
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,203
            before we get there
            if we don't take
            the<i> autostrada.</i>

521
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,773
<i> No autostrada.</i> No hurry.

522
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:34,311
3:00 tomorrow.

523
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,114
            You're supposed
            to be there
            at 3:00 tomorrow?

524
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,650
            Why is it
            so important?

525
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:42,119
            What is it
            you have to do?

526
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,559
            I hope you realize
            what a sacrifice
            I'm making here.

527
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,395
        I have someone
        waiting for me
        in New York, you know.

528
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,497
        He needs help, or
        he's gonna go to jail,

529
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,666
        and I'm the only one
        who can save him.

530
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,735
        I guess you wouldn't
        understand that.

531
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,670
    Why?

532
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,171
        Because I love him.

533
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,740
And he loves me, too.

534
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,342
But he says that if
I don't help him now,

535
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,643
we'll have
no future together.

536
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,247
            You know,
            he's desperate.

537
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,182
            He's been waiting
            for days already.

538
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,155
<i> Ho aspettato 50 anni.</i>

539
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,056
        Hey, that's...

540
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,065
I needed.

541
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,984
You're sure they're gonna
come by here, right?

542
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,719
                Yes. 100%.

543
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,369
    What's that,

544
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,504
    that picture?

545
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,207
            Nothing.

546
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,274
        Hey, you.

547
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,343
        I tell you
        about me and Tyler,

548
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,544
        and you say, "Nothing."

549
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,912
            How's that fair?

550
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,620
            Who's that?

551
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,557
            "Candy & Marcel."

552
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,693
Candy, Carmen.

553
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,094
            Is this you?

554
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,464
<i> E Marcellino.</i>

555
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:11,201
        What were you,
        part of some pop group
        or something?

556
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,536
    <i> Sì.</i>

557
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,905
We were very young,

558
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:18,141
and Marcello Gaspari--

559
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,043
...arrive in my town,

560
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:24,214
and we sing together.

561
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,986
We made a tour
in Napoli, Roma, Firenze,

562
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,722
and I felt
in love with him,

563
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:35,058
but I had to go home.

564
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,394
I was supposed
to get married.

565
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,829
<i> Avevo promesso.</i>

566
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,066
            To Luca's father?

567
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,301
    Yes.

568
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:52,743
            So what happened?

569
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,810
        What?

570
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,815
            I mean, why did you
            marry an asshole
            like Jack?

571
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,788
I guess I didn't
think he was that big
of an asshole.

572
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,624
What about you? Hmm?

573
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,926
                What?

574
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:12,262
Tell me you were serious
about one woman,

575
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,597
one woman...
                    Ohh.

576
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,265
in your entire life.

577
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,266
                    Heh.

578
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,101
Yeah, I'd like to hear this.

579
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,870
                I take all women
                seriously.

580
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:22,606
                This is
                my most serious
                subject.

581
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,607
                Really.

582
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:31,181
            But, see,
            there was one woman.

583
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,686
    Yeah, what?
    It didn't work out?

584
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,790
             She had, um--
            <i> Come se dice?</i>

585
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,458
            A fistfight
            with my mother.

586
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,962
Heh. She had a fistfight
with your mother?

587
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,230
                Yes.
Wow. Who won?

588
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,135
                    My mother.

589
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,136
        Your mother.

590
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,140
            Anyway, her nose
            was too fat.

591
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,408
    What? W-Wow.

592
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,409
    What? Really?

593
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,510
            Yes.

594
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,079
Really?
Here I am.

595
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,748
I'm trying to have, like,
a sincere conversation,

596
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,351
but it's with this guy,
this so--

597
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,086
he's this
superficial guy...

598
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,154
            Oh, my God.
very superficial guy.

599
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,423
            That's it.
            That's why, no?

600
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,926
            Because I was
            too superficial?

601
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:20,364
        No.

602
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:24,334
    Actually, they were
    two of the nicest months
    of my life.

603
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,509
        Last year,
        my husband died.

604
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,745
        I cry a lot.

605
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:38,181
But one day,
I receive letter.

606
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,183
                From Marcellino?

607
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,353
1, 2, 3 letters.

608
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,354
<i> Segreto.</i>

609
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,123
        <i> Segreto?</i> Secret?

610
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,593
Big, big secret.

611
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,405
        Oh, my God.

612
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,873
        You're getting married?

613
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,042
Tomorrow, 3:00.

614
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,477
Santa Caterina
dei Funari.

615
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,213
        So we're the same,
        you and Marcellino,
        me and Tyler.

616
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,315
It's not comparable.

617
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:15,052
Tyler is trouble.

618
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,086
He's asshole.

619
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,220
                No.

620
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,955
            He's just kinda...

621
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,426
Asshole.

622
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,895
Heh. Use you.

623
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,897
No honor.

624
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,299
            <i> Eh! La strada</i>
            <i> è libero.</i>

625
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,505
<i> ¶ E tutta a un tratto ¶</i>

626
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,241
<i> ¶ Mi son messa a ballar ¶</i>

627
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,242
    <i> ¶ Twist, twist ¶</i>

628
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,844
    <i> ¶ Ho pensato a te ¶</i>

629
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,245
<i> ¶ Yeah, twist, twist ¶</i>

630
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,947
    <i> ¶ Se tu stavi con me ¶</i>

631
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,449
    <i> ¶ Twist, twist ¶</i>

632
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:48,452
<i> ¶ Avresti ballato anche tu ¶</i>

633
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:51,421
        Anyway, it would
        never have worked.

634
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:55,258
        I'm an artist,
        and I need a woman
        who is not so uptight.

635
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,426
I'm not uptight?
            No?

636
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,762
No, just unlike
some people,

637
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,197
I have responsibilities.

638
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,600
        That's what people say
        when they have

639
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,769
        a pathological need
        to be in control.

640
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,472
Then how come I always
feel out of control?

641
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,974
        You controlling types
        always feel like that.

642
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,277
That's why you don't--

643
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,046
        you don't let me drive.

644
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,114
That's not why.

645
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,448
                No?
    Mm-mmm.

646
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,453
        So give me the kiss.

647
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,623
    What?
            Give me the kiss.

648
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,792
I'm not gonna give you the kiss.
            Come on.

649
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,128
            Come here.
Oh! Luca, oh, my God.

650
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,896
<i> ¶ Ho visto ballare</i>
<i> il twist... ¶</i>

651
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,398
        Don't flatter yourself.
        The keys.

652
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,567
Oh.

653
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,837
        <i> ¶ Twist, Twist ¶</i>
 Oh, no!

654
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,906
    <i> ¶ Ho pensato a te,</i>
    <i> twist, twist... ¶</i>

655
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,407

656

    <i> ¶ Twist, twist... ¶</i>

657
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,678
        No! Now what?!

658
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,814
Let's go.

659
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,816
                Let's go!
Yeah. Let's go.

660
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,651
Now we better
call the police.

661
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,154
    Oh, no. There must be
    another option. Please.

662
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:58,989
            Another option.
            Oh, another option.

663
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,258
            I've got a friend
            who is a TV
            presenter.

664
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,826
            Maybe if they
            mention it on TV,

665
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,495
            someone is
            bound to notice
            an old Alfa, no?

666
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,497
        Is there--
        Is there a "but"?

667
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,932
    No, no. No.

668
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,567
OK. Well,
then let's go.

669
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,131
            Giulia?

670
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,365
        <i> Luca, tesoro!</i>

671
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,035
        <i> Sono qui in piscina.</i>

672
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,037
<i> Grazie.</i>

673
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,911
            This is Maggie.

674
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,279
            She's a journalist,
            too.

675
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,752
Um...

676
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,721
Giulia Carni.
Please sit down.

677
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,256
So you have
a picture?

678
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,724
        Oh, yes.
    Yes.

679
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,493
        Just, um, here.

680
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,262
            Um...

681
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:15,165
        Here's--That's
        my daughter Summer.

682
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,272
<i> Ah, bella Carmen.</i>

683
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,909
            You carry a picture
            of your mother?

684
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,445
                    Yeah.
It's sweet, no?

685
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,281
Ah.

686
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,582
Paola.

687
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,917
<i> Sì? Arrivo.</i>

688
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,585
                Send the picture
                to the station

689
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,686
                so they
                are prepared

690
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,255
when I get there.
        <i> Va bene.</i>

691
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,926
I'm sure Giulia
will do her very best.

692
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,928
        Oh, I'm sure she will.
    Yeah.

693
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,197
She seems very, um...

694
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,765
dedicated,

695
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,468
no matter what she does.

696
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,836
What?

697
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,474
            Are you jealous?

698
00:37:57,476 --> 00:38:00,443
 I'm not jealous, just--

699
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,313
Ah, actually I guess
I'm not surprised.

700
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:06,116
A lady in every town.

701
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,784
            Oh, come on.

702
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,121
        OK, what can I say?

703
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,723
        When love calls,
        a man must act.

704
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,058
Are you kidding me?

705
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,459
No.

706
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,396
            A man takes
            what he wants
            when he wants.

707
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,167
"A man--"

708
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:26,469
            "A man takes

709
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,805
            what he wants
            when he wants it"?

710
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,006
                    Wow.

711
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,008
I'm joking. Come on.

712
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,344
What happened
to your sense of humor?

713
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,651
I like it
when you're jealous.

714
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,332
            Oh, my God.

715
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,500
            Where are we,
            the spaghetti
            western frontier?

716
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,369
        ¶ Who's ¶

717
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:03,239
¶ Gonna let you down tonight? ¶

718
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,712
        ¶ Who's... ¶

719
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:11,014
Wow. Check it out.

720
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,852
        I got a mighty thirst,
        partner.

721
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,253
        How's the sarsaparilla?

722
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:23,193
            Ooh. This town
            ain't big enough
            for the both of us.

723
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,895
<i> Cosa hai detto?</i>

724
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,364
        You seriously
        don't speak any English?

725
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:30,033
        That's
        so cross-culturally
        awesome.

726
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,302
        <i> Due panini, per favore.</i>

727
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,603
            <i> Due.</i>

728
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,214
<i> ...americana, Summer Falk...</i>

729
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,226
            "Nonna-napper"?
            What does it mean?

730
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,227
<i> Sbrigati.</i>

731
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,462
                Hey!
Hurry!

732
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,254
            <i> Va bene. Va bene.</i>
            <i> Grazie.</i>

733
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,488

00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,093
        There have already
        been several reports

735
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,763
        from people who thinks
        they've seen the car
        in this area.

736
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,931
Oh, thank God.

737
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,267
OK, so what do we do now?

738
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,301
            We wait.

739
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,303
Shouldn't we
go after them?

740
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,306
I mean, why don't
we go meet them
at the airport in Rome?

741
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:46,276
        No, no, no. If they
        go to the airport,
        they will be caught.

742
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,045
            They will not allow
            a minor on a flight

743
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,347
            without permission
            from a parent
            or guardian.

744
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,951
        Relax.
        It will soon be dark,

745
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,554
        and, uh--and we
        need to rest.

746
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,355
        So will they.

747
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:02,826
<i> Sono stanca.</i>

748
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:04,294
We stop for night.

749
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,963
            We can't, Carmen.
            I'm all over the TV,

750
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,965
            wanted by police
            as a Nonna-napper,

751
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,133
            which is a joke.

752
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,302
We stop to sleep.

753
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,636
            Don't you get it?

754
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,638
            They'll recognize us
            at any hotel.

755
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,140
No hotel.

756
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,708
Just sleep.

757
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,760
I was expecting a motel.

758
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:40,864
        This is how we do.

759
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:42,432
"This is how we do"?

760
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:43,933
                Yeah.

761
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,001
Well...

762
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,336
        This is
        idiomatic expression.

763
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,172
Yeah. No, I--
I know what it is.

764
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,173
I'm just...

765
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,448
    Feel sort of
    underdressed.

766
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,449
            A little.

767
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,718
        Excuse us.

768
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,419
                <i> Buonasera.</i>
                <i> Buonasera.</i>

769
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,857
            You want to try?

770
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,292
What? No.
            Come here.

771
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,127
    How do you mean no?

772
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,795
        I'm very good
        with that, eh,

773
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,364
         with the waltz?

774
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,865
Are you good?

775
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,433
Good enough.

776
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,970
Separate rooms, please.

777
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:22,705
    I'm sorry, madam,

778
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,408
    but we do have
    only one room left tonight.

779
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,609
            Are you kidding me?

780
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:30,813
                    Oh.

781
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:33,049
                Oh, oh, oh, my.

782
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,484
                    Oh.

783
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,055
        It's OK.

784
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,790
        I'll sleep on the floor.

785
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,604
        Oh! Valentina.

786
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,606
                    Oh.

787
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:31,274
    She must be
    worried by now.

788
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,376
                Of course.

789
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,378
<i> Valentina, tesoro.</i>

790
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,546
<i> Sì, scusa, amore...</i>

791
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,306
            Good night, Carmen.

792
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,574
<i> Buona note.</i>

793
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:35,271
Oh! What?

794
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,206
        You said you were
        sleeping on the floor.

795
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,508
Oh, my God. Yes.

796
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,510
        You said you were
        sleeping on the floor.

797
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,345
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it
was too uncomfortable.

798
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:58,695
        Maggie, I have
        to tell you something
        very important.

799
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,264
            Yeah?

800
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:06,369
            Your body
            still look banging.

801
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,704
            Really.

802
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:08,871
                    Ow.

803
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,574
                What--What did--
                Oh! Oh, my God!

804
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:12,642
    Oh!
        Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

805
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:13,876
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

806
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,211
                Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Did I--

807
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,546
Did I do that?

808
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:17,547
            Yes, you did it.
            You did it.

809
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:18,548
Let me see. Are you OK?

810
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,051
I hope it hurts.

811
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,052
Hope it hurts.

812
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,921
            Ow! My God,

813
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,823
you're terrible.

814
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,970
                Wow.

815
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,694
                    Wow.

816
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:17,206
A red Alfa has been
spotted near a lake
not far from here.

817
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,842
            They have probably
            camped overnight.

818
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,449
                What?

819
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,054
Your eye,

820
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,956
it's a little red.

821
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,291
Does it still hurt?

822
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,559
                Oh.

823
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,494
 Here.

824
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,029
Here you are.

825
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,498
Ay, yeah.

826
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,200
    Ah.

827
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,205
It's better, right?

828
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,375
            You're a bad person.

829
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,547
            Good body,
            but bad person.

00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:50,820
    Mm.

897
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,755
        Not as nervous

898

899

        as long as you

904
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,105

00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,210
        just as much as you

00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,379

920
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:41,537
        we should call
        the police,

I'm such

00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,882
I tried. I tried.
I really tried.

926
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,551
I don't know.
Where did I go wrong?

927
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,887
        First you stole
        her phone, and then--

928
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,422
Yes, I know that.

929
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:02,224
I'm talking about

930
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,794
How did it
all come to this?

931
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,832
                I think
                he is right.

932
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,001
                You should call
                the police.

00:51:12,003 --> 00:51:15,237

00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:13,462
Here, there's nothing,
nothing.

944
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,309

00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,203
<i> E' tanto difficile?</i>

950
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,672
You go to the tractor,
open tank,

951
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,674
and steal<i> benzina.</i>

952
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,244
                Great.

953
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:18,487

00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,626
    Come on!

956
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,661
                Eh!

    Nonna-napper is kidnapper?

958
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,795
No. No, no, no.

959
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,830
It's just about
telling a story.

960
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,632
        What did you tell them?

961
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,900
Nothing.

962
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,902
        Well, she's describing
        Summer as if--

963
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,171
        as if she's, like,
        this dangerous criminal,

964
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:11,307
        and your mother
        is, like,

965
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:13,575
    "Oh, she's
    this helpless woman

966
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:16,011
    who was tragically
    stolen against her will."

967
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:21,083
At this rate, Summer will
rot in an Italian jail
for years.

968
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:23,152
        Heh. If we don't
        find them in time,

969
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:24,987
        she will rot
        in an American jail.

970
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,021
        Same deal, worse food.

971
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,256
Oh, ha ha.

972
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:28,691
Yeah, make a joke.
It's hilarious.

973
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:30,159
You don't seem
to get it!

974
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,095
Your mother is as much
a part of this as Summer!

975
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,998
She has manipulated
this whole thing.

976
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,166
            Oh, my mother?

977
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,268
Yes, your mother...
            My mother.

978
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,036
is one serious bitch,

979
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,838
and she
always has been.

980
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,006
            Don't say that--

981
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,341
It's true.

982
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,575
It's true.

983
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:50,546
It's true.

984
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,383
            Valentina.

985
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:55,851
            <i> Sì, pronto.</i>

986
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,692
        ...Marcellino Gaspari.

987
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,035
You're not gonna
believe this.

988
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,071
My mother thinks
she's getting married
today at 3:00.

989
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,706
            What? To who?

990
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,309
There was a man
who filled her head

991
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,911
with a lot of nonsense
when she was young.

992
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:25,214
He got her
to run away from home,

993
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,149
and now he's
after her again.

994
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:30,919
She must have been
totally brainwashed.

995
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:34,490
            Oh, I think
            she knows exactly
            what she's doing.

996
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:35,824
            Do you know where?

997
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,593
No, I don't know.
In Rome,

998
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,829
but Valentina's
trying to find out more.

999
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,744
            What time is it?

1000
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,079
Almost 2:00.

1001
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,580
<i> E' impossibile</i>

1002
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,083
        I'm so sorry, Carmen.

1003
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,285
Marcellino,
what he think?

1004
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:04,353
<i> Non lo so.</i>

1005
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,759
<i> Che fortuna.</i>

1006
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,128
        I'm gonna get this guy
        to stop, no matter what.

1007
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,763
Good. Show leg.

1008
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,131
        Show my leg?
Yes.

1009
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,633
        Is that
        a cultural thing?

1010
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:20,369
Sexual,
cross-cultural,
cross--

1011
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:22,438
        I think
        my natural charms
        will be enough.

1012
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,640
        Hey! Stop!

1013
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:25,774
<i> Mamma mia.</i>

1014
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,376
        What? What?! No.

1015
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,481
        And now what?

1016
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:35,451
        I supposed
        to let a greasy farmer
        feel me up?

1017
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,523
            <i> Ciao.</i>

1018
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,364
Sorry about
the, uh, "Whoo."

1019
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,169
Actually,
it was her idea.

1020
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,338
            Don't apologize.

1021
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,739
            I liked it.

1022
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,326
<i> Salve.</i>
                    <i> Salve.</i>

1023
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,163
And you are
the mother of...

1024
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,098
Summer Falk.
                Yes.

1025
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,869
The same woman
featured in the news
as a Nonna-napper?

1026
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:29,838
        Well,
        that's not accurate.

1027
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,008
But she did take
this man's car
without his consent,

1028
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,610
and at the same time,

1029
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,512
she kidnapped his mother.

1030
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,547
        Well, no. No, she wanted
        to be kidnapped.

1031
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:40,682
        No, I mean,
        she didn't want to be--

1032
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:41,884
        She didn't want
        to be kidnapped,

1033
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:43,719
        but she's been
        trying to get--

1034
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:47,456
It says here that she
claimed to be a kidnapper
at the airport.

1035
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:48,457
            What?

1036
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,559
            No. No, no, no,
            no, no, no.

1037
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:52,194
No.

1038
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:55,697
            I said
            I kidnapped her.

1039
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,865
Oh, you kidnapped her.

1040
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:57,966
        Yes. No, no, no.

1041
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,201
        I mean,
        I didn't kidnap her.

1042
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,702
        I was saying it,
        like, as a--

1043
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,204
        you know,
        just as a joke.

1044
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,239
         You know, as a joke.
         You know, like--

1045
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,307
As a joke.

1046
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,042
            It's funny.
            Like ha ha ha.

1047
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,044
Can you please
provide her physical
characteristics, please?

1048
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,379
            Sure. Sure. Um...

1049
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:13,215
            she's, um--
            She's 5'3",

1050
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:18,053
             and, um,
             she has blue eyes.

1051
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,323
        Uh, she has
        a couple of piercings.

1052
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,258
        I mean,
        they're very minor,

1053
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,260
        not as bad as it sounds.

1054
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:26,762
        Um, and, uh...

1055
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,830
        she has a tattoo.

1056
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:29,998
A tattoo?

1057
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,400
            One or two,

1058
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,101
            but they're
            very innocuous
            thematically.

1059
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,336
            You know,
            she has a--

1060
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,004
            It's, like--
            She has a butterfly,

1061
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,673
            and she has
            a cute little...

1062
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:39,274
            skull.

1063
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:40,576
Yeah.
            I mean, it's--

1064
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:41,743
            They're teenagers,

1065
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,745
            so you--What are
            you gonna do?

1066
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,914
Yeah.
Uh, criminal records?

1067
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:50,686
            Well, um,
            it's a little bit
            of a gray area,

1068
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,754
            I mean,
            legally speaking,
            'cause she's not a--

1069
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,023
At the airport,
she claimed to have
no criminal past.

1070
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:58,093
        Look, are you
        going to help me?

1071
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,697
Criminal records, please.

1072
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,031
                Um...

1073
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:06,602
            all right,
            there were
            these rabbits.

1074
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,270
    Rabbits?

1075
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:11,506
            Yes, and they needed
            to be liberated.

1076
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,458
         Hello.

1077
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,459
Maggie.
  Hello.

1078
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:31,793
            The marriage will be

1079
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,729
            at the Chiesa
            Santa Caterina
            dei Funari.

1080
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,896
        OK.
            Tell Luca.

1081
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:37,466
            He must hurry.
        Yeah.

1082
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,467
<i> Grazie.</i>

1083
01:00:52,016 --> 01:00:54,549
Chiesa Santa Caterina
dei Funari.

1084
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,322
            Maggie!

1085
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,912
            Look. Roma.

1086
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,516
Wow.

1087
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:32,187
        Perfect hiding place
        for the kidnapper
        of<i> la nonna,</i> right?

1088
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,855
What?
            Relax.

1089
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,457
            I admire you.

1090
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:38,960
    You do?

1091
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,529
                    Yeah.

1092
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:43,031
        You know
        those farmer dudes
        with the chickens?

1093
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,700
        They are my neighbors.

1094
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,803
        I run an ecological farm
        in the next valley,

1095
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:51,973
        but those men,
        they are assholes,

1096
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,608
        treat their chickens
        like shit.

1097
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,045
        I'm glad
        you liberated them.

1098
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,548
Actually, it wasn't
planned this time.

1099
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,551
We just needed some gas
so we could get to Rome.

1100
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:05,287
She's got a hot date
at some<i> chiesa,</i> you know?

1101
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:10,926
But I guess, in a way,

1102
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,228
you could say
that's a higher purpose.

1103
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,496
        And what about you?

1104
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:19,234
            You also have
            a hot date?

1105
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,569
    No.

1106
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,270
    I...

1107
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:25,240
kinda got a boyfriend
back home, but...

1108
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,142
                    Too bad.

1109
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,712
        Here we are.

1110
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,858
Do you--

1111
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,261
Are you on Facebook,
by any chance?

1112
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,230
            I'll find you.

1113
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,516
Hey, Rome, huh?

1114
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,352
            Let's do
            as the Romans don't.

1115
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,520
            I know I will.

1116
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,222
            Do you know
            your way around?

1117
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:22,023
<i> Sì, sì.</i>
 It's not so far.

1118
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,193
        That's great.
        Marcellino will be
        so buzzed to see you.

1119
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,295
Tyler will be buzzed,
too, no?

1120
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:30,699
                    Yeah.

1121
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,903
            Now I guess
            I'll go find

1122
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,605
            an airport bus
            or something.

1123
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,717
        Come on.
        Let's get out of here.

1124
01:04:58,095 --> 01:04:59,828
    Oh,<i> scusi. Scusi.</i>

1125
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,763
    Uh, Chiesa--

1126
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:03,732
    Chiesa Santa Caterina?

1127
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:04,833
    It's a church.

1128
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:06,768
    Excuse me.
    Chiesa Santa Cat--

1129
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,570
    Thanks.
    Santa Caterina?

1130
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:16,111
    Oh, um,<i> dove--</i>

1131
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,079
    uh, you know where,

1132
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,249
    uh, Chiesa Santa Caterina
    dei Funari--

1133
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,285
    Chiesa--It's a church.

1134
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:24,686
    This way?

1135
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,354
    Ah,<i> grazie, grazie.</i>

1136
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,290
    <i> Uh, molto bella, grazie.</i>

1137
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:30,425
Don't worry
   about it, lady.

1138
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,427
Oh, thank you.

1139
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:34,930
            Hello.

1140
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,097
Maggie.

1141

OK.

1148
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,634
                Is this it?

1149
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:20,308
    OK. Eh?

1150
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,410
                    Yeah.
    Yes?

1151
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,916
            Is it OK if I
            come with you?

1152
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,592

Oh, Carmen.

01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,837
Sorry.

1162
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,405
            Hi. Ah, honey.
What are you doing?

1163
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,107
You're totally screwing up
this beautiful thing.

1164
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:00,675
        Listen to me.
        You listen to me, OK?

1165
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,243
        The police are coming,
        but it's OK.

1166
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,611
        I'm gonna fix
        everything, all right?
Fix what?

1167
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,246
        I need you
        to come with me now.

1168
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,848
No, Mom,
I am not leaving.

1173
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,760
No. Stop it.
            We have to go.

1174
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,362
            Seriously, you have
            to come with me now.
            I'm serious.

1175
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:22,697
I'm not moving.

1176
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,138

        No. No, no, no.
        You can't do this.

1185
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,024
Yes, we can, madam.

1186
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:25,160
        'Cause your daughter
        has stolen a car,

1187

        kidnapped
        a defenseless old--

No, she didn't kidnap--

1189
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,331
        She's driven without
        a valid driving license.

1190
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,367
         She forged
         your signature

1191
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,369
        and caused damage
        to a hire car,

1192
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:37,205
        stolen gasoline,
        broken a fence,
        released chickens,

1193
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:38,940
        and caused what
        could have developed...

1194
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:40,942
For crying out loud.
        into a major fire

1195
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,510
        if the firemen hadn't
        come very quickly.

1196
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,346
        And all of the above
        in less than 24 hours.

1197
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,683
Summer, Summer, Summer.

1198
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,051
    Stop, no! Mom!
                No, no, no.

1199
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:52,353
        Can't just take her.
        I have to be with her.

1200
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,189
        What are you doing?
        Where are you
        taking her?

1201
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:55,723
         I don't even know
         where you're
         taking her.

1202
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:56,724
                To the police
                station, madam.

1203
01:09:56,726 --> 01:09:58,026
            Hey, gentle! Gentle!

1204
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,530
            Stop it! Don't be
            so rough with her!

1205
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,566
            She's not
            a hardened criminal.
            What are you doing?

1206
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,368
There will be a hearing
tomorrow morning at 9:00
at the police station.

1207
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,704
That will be
your opportunity
to state your case.

1208
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,239
<i> - Arrivederci. </i>
-   Mom.

1209
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,541
            Honey, I'm coming,
            OK? I'll be
            right there.

1210
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,809
            I'll be right there.
            I'll be--

1211
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,085
    Hey.

1212
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,087
I'm sorry.

1213
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,822
Maybe things got
a little out of hand.

1214
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,724
        W-Why are you sorry?

1215
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:32,393
        You got your story.
        That's what you wanted,
        wasn't it?

1216
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,728
I wanted to help you.

1217
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:37,899
            Luca. You wanted
            to help Luca.

1218
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:47,075
Call me if there's
anything I can do for you.

1219
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,643
Please.

1220
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,035
                    Hi.

1221
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:35,623
Candy and Marcel. Heh.

1222
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,393
The way we were.

1223
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,667
    It would
    have been so cool

1224
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:48,970
    just to have had
    one more chance,
    you know?

1225
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,769
        Uh, she's in
        room 103.

1226
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:23,271
                This one.
                Thank you.

1227
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:24,739
                <i> Grazie.</i> Thanks.

1228
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:40,955
<i> Sì.</i>

1229
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,458
    Maggie.

1230
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:46,694
                    Hey.
    Hi.

1231
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,297
        I wanted to see
        how Carmen was, and--

1232
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:50,365
She was lucky.

1233
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:53,401
She has a mild concussion

1234
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:57,071
from when she fell
and hit her head
on the floor.

1235
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,706
She's recovering well.

1236
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,809
        Oh, my God, I'm glad.
        I'm so glad.

1237
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,880
            I really wanted
            to apologize

1238
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,317
            for being
            so selfish.

1239
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:11,219
What should I expect
from a woman

1240
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:14,155
who just runs away
when it suits her?

1241
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:16,157
It was the same
back then.

1242
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,658
You just...

1243
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,727
packed your bags and left.

1244
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,729
You act unilaterally.

1245
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,664
 You cut off communication.

1246
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:26,000
That's fine. Heh.

1247
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,102
 The message is clear,
<i> chiaro.</i>

1248
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:29,837
            But, Luca,
            back then, I--

1249
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:30,972
    What?

1250
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:34,442
            I thought
            you would forget it.

1251
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:35,576
    Sure.

1252
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,812
Just because I...

1253
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:41,416
I tell every girl I meet
that I love her?

1254
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,520
Don't worry about it.

1255
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,522
I'm fine.
My mother is fine.

1256
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:48,856
 My daughter is fine.

1257
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,425
                Daughter?

1258
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,097
                    Oh.

1259
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,101
                    So OK.

1260
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:02,003
Goodbye, Maggie.

1261
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:42,643
Giulia Carni.

1262
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,379
    Giulia, it's Maggie Falk.

1263
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,753
Giulia.

1264
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,222
                Oh.

1265
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,365
Look, I've told you
I'm so sorry.

1266
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:05,867
        No, you said every story

1267
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:08,102
        can be viewed
        from different angles,

1268
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,571
        and I would
        like to give you
        another opportunity.

1269
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,347
What is this all about?

1270
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:23,351
            Well, if you
            will listen,
            I will tell you.

1271
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:27,054
    OK.

1272
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,524
I suppose I owe you that.

1273
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,926
But I need a drink first.

1274
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:35,530
<i> Ragazzo,</i>
<i> martini per favore.</i>

1275
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:44,739
            Thank you
            for helping me.

1276
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:47,375
            I was concerned
            you might...

1277
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:50,811
        have a negative attitude
        because of him, Luca.

1278
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:53,080
Luca? No.

1279
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,416
I gave him up
long time ago.

1280
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,952
Too hard to get.

1281
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,623
Well, we dated some...

1282
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:07,128
but there was always
someone else in the way...

1283
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,933
some woman
a long, long time ago

1284
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:14,068
who he couldn't forget.

1285
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,736
I think
she was American.

1286
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:21,242
I wish the two of you
all luck.

1287
01:16:32,522 --> 01:16:35,523
    ...comprising 17 infractions

1288
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:38,359
    to be sentenced
    under the juvenile court

1289
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:41,963
    with the expected outcome
    of a significant fine,

1290
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:46,100
        criminal record,
        and proceeding
        for deportation.

1291
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,604
    I'm--

1292
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:50,871
I'm sorry.

1293
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:52,707
 I'm sorry I'm late.

1294
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,475
            Mom, where were you?
Sorry, honey.

1295
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:57,211
    Oh, yeah, that's all right.
    We'll soon be finished here.

1296
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,046
    Since your daughter
    is a minor,

1297
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:01,716
    you'll be called
    to a separate meeting
    with social services,

1298
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:04,619
    um, so we can go through
    details and--

1299
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,788
        and, uh, discuss--

1300
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,124
        I'm sorry.
        I have to take this.

1301
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,225
        <i> Pronto, Comandante.</i>

1302
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:15,229
        <i> Sì. Sì--</i>

1303
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:16,497
        <i> Scusi?</i>

1304
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,303
        <i> Grazie. Grazie.</i>

1305
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:50,531
            ¶ Mmm ¶

1306
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:52,400
    ¶ I know I'm gonna make it ¶

1307
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,005
¶ ...and look at the sun ¶

1308
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,175
¶ See your life
from the other side ¶

1309
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,010
¶ Watch the world
passing by ¶

1310
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,345
¶ Grab a seat in the sky ¶

1311
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:06,847
¶ Grab a ride,
grab a ride in the sky ¶

1312
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,683
    ¶ 'Cause all roads ¶

1313
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:11,552
¶ All roads lead to Rome... ¶

1314
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:46,387
        Wow, Mom,
        that was amazing.

1315
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:49,090
        How'd you get her
        to go along with you?

1316
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:52,059
Oh, I appealed
to her sense of...

1317
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,494
journalistic sisterhood.

1318
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:54,995
        Well, you journalized
        the hell out of it.

1319
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:56,263
Did I?
            Totally.

1320
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,599
        You were like, "I came,
        I saw, I crushed."

1321
01:18:58,601 --> 01:18:59,834
        You were Caesar.

1322
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:02,002
Wow. If you say so.

1323
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,738
        You were
        like the mother
        of all Caesars.

1324
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,406
         You really--
         a Caesarian section.

1325
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:08,075
        You operated.
        You liberated Caesar
        from your womb.

1326
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,077
Oh, I did.

1327
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,112
    Mmm.

1328
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:13,848
I liberated
my little rabbit.

1329
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,182
        Don't call me that.

1330
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:16,417
Well, it's true.

1331
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,452
You're free.

1332
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:20,121
And when I say free,

1333
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,289
I mean free.

1334
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:26,293
        You mean I can do
        whatever I want and
        call Tyler free?

1335
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:28,963
I am backing you 100%.

1336
01:19:28,965 --> 01:19:31,298
        Even if I drive
        off a cliff?

1337
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,200
Yes.
I mean, not physically.

1338
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,302
        In that case,

1339
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:37,037
        can I borrow your phone?

1340
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:40,608
I'm getting you
a new one.

1341
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,842
            Thanks.

1342
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,053
        Tyler?

1343
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,622
            Summer. Heh.

1344
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,490
            Baby, yo,
            how'd it go?

1345
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:59,627
            Um, are you--Are you
            cool to head back?

1346
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:02,296
Yeah. I can do
whatever I want.

1347
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:05,166
            That is awesome.
So that's settled.

1348
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:08,302
It turns out I'm not going
to be able to help you.

1349
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,737
            But you promised.

1350
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:10,971
I did,

1351
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,573
but I'm breaking
that promise,

1352
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,809
'cause I realized
you have no honor.

1353
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:15,843
                    Honor?

1354
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:17,912
Yeah, honor,

1355
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:20,981
an apparently outmoded
patriarchal concept
that I'm--

1356
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,017
                    I'm...

1357
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:27,822
    That I'm--
    I'm reappropriating
    as a nongender term

1358
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,991
    for the furtherance
    of individual
    responsibility.

1359
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,259
            Can you just
            tell him that?

1360
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:34,995
    No, no. It's better
    coming from you.

1361
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,831
            What I mean is,

1362
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,266
        Tyler, you're a dick.

1363
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:49,777
            What are you
            gonna do now?

1364
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:51,512
            Go back
            to Uncle George's
            cottage?

1365
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,881
Nah, nah, nah.
We're gonna stay in Rome
for a few days,

1366
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:56,016
'cause there's
something that I promised
to make right.

1367
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,251
                Hmm.

1368
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:13,767
        <i> Grazie.</i>

1369
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:19,640
        OK.

1370
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:22,610
                Hey.

1371
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:27,114
        <i> Grazie.</i>

1372
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:30,718
    Hi.

1373
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:35,756
            You're right.

1374
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:38,792
            I do cut people off
            when I'm scared.

1375
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:41,395
Maggie, I--
            I wish--

1376
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:45,599
            I wish I had been
            straight with you.

1377
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,568
            I wish I had stayed

1378
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,937
            instead of
            running away.

1379
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:51,672
Yeah, but--
                You don't have
                to explain.

1380
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:54,475
            Honestly, it
            doesn't matter now.

1381
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:57,745
            I just came
            because I want

1382
01:21:57,747 --> 01:22:01,515
            to return the favor
            you did me when you
            opened my eyes,

1383
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:04,919
            because your mother
            is genuinely

1384
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:07,588
            very much in love
            with that man,

1385
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,925
            and she is
            gonna do what she
            wants to do

1386
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:13,260
            with or without
            your say-so.

1387
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,828
                So...

1388
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,767
                say so.

1389
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:25,306
        Maybe.

1390
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:26,840
        I don't know.

1391
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:30,945
            By the way, how old
            is your daughter?

1392
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:32,112
        23.

1393
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,381
            So you already
            had her back then.

1394
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:36,951
            I mean
            when we were...

1395
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,018
            when we
            were together.

1396
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:44,391
        Why didn't you tell me?

1397
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:47,628
Would you have gone
with a divorced guy

1398
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,197
 with a young daughter?

1399
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:55,235
        I'm gonna take that
        as rhetorical.

1400
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,039
        Hey.

1401
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,644
    Could you...

1402
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,746
    accept one now?

1403
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:14,588
        See how you feel
        about that thought
        in 20 minutes' time.

1404
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,926
What?

1405
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,763
Where are you going?

1406
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:24,231
            Shh.

1407
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:36,343
    Oh.

1408
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,116
Did you arrange this?

1409
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,221
        A woman takes
        what she wants

1410
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:49,256
        when she wants it,
        right, Carmen?

1411
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,751
<i> Marcellino e Carmen...</i>

1412
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,263
    <i> Sì.</i>
                    <i> Sì.</i>

1413
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,040
<i> Sì.</i>

1414
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,775
<i> Sì.</i>

1415
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:19,379
            <i> A la mia</i>
            <i> bellissima sposa.</i>

1416
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:20,981
                <i> Sposa.</i> Hey!

1417
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:24,785
            She looks so happy.

1418
01:25:29,492 --> 01:25:32,826
        I think you're
        gonna have to
        get used to that.

1419
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:36,063
        And this as well.

1420
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:37,397
            Maybe.

1421
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:51,979
    Hmm.

1422
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:54,848
I think, with the use
of all my strength...

1423
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,017
I think I'll manage.

1424
01:25:58,587 --> 01:25:59,920
1, 2...

    ¶ Why do I long
    to be free ¶

1504
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:05,232
    ¶ But cry when you
    walk out the door? ¶

1505
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:08,668

like a record now ¶

to your downtown rivers ¶

1510

¶ In your dried-out cities ¶

1511
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:30,257
    ¶ I could compromise
    my rhythm ¶

1512
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:33,693
    ¶ So we both go slow ¶

1513
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:37,531
¶ Take me to your treetops
growing up ¶

1514
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:40,434
¶ In your dried-out cities ¶

1515
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:44,271
¶ If you get my heart,
it'll never stop ¶

1516
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:48,308

of an eye ¶

01:31:07,296 --> 01:31:08,962
¶ Oh oh,
oh oh, oh oh ¶

1522
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:14,367
    ¶ Let's make
    our own legacy ¶

1523
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:22,409
    ¶ Chiseled in stone,
    we will be ¶

1524
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:25,979
¶ You've got me going round
like a record, babe... ¶
