1
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:04,691
(majestic music)

2
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:18,432
(seagulls calling)
(waves rumbling)

3
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:35,736
(classical piano music)

4
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,820
- My fingers just don't seem
to get the message anymore.

5
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,642
- That's just temporary, Bill.

6
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:12,475
- No, Mom.

7
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,789
Teeth, hair, 20/20 vision,

8
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:18,804
breath to run up three flights of stairs,

9
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,471
those are temporary.

10
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,872
- Sweetheart, please,

11
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,647
won't you change your mind and stay?

12
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,480
- (chuckling) We've been through this,

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,797
it's not what I want.

14
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:30,833
Now, I'll see you on Thanksgiving,

15
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,753
I'll speak to you often,

16
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,129
all right?

17
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:36,099
If Millard calls,

18
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,933
will you tell him that
I tried to reach him?

19
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:38,933
- Of course.

20
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:42,849
- How is he, have you heard?

21
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,297
- No.

22
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,169
- You're not exactly a
charity case, you know,

23
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,017
there's no need to move
clear across the country

24
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:50,049
into some halfway house in Seattle

25
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,132
crowded with sick people.

26
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,353
- Well, I'm quite lucky, actually.

27
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,769
I can't work, but I feel useful.

28
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,457
It's a place that I need

29
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:00,513
where I feel needed,

30
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,346
okay?

31
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:03,881
- Bill, Barbara's right.

32
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,381
If, if it's a matter of money-

33
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,137
- Thanks, but I figure from kindergarten

34
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:11,423
through six years of college,

35
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:13,755
I'm already overdrawn.

36
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:16,761
- (chuckling) Well, nevermind that.

37
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,594
If things get too bad-

38
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,337
- Well, you know what they say?

39
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:25,897
You never know until you're there.

40
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:26,730
Goodbye.

41
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,601
- Here, let me help you with those.

42
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,877
- Thanks.

43
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:32,969
- I remember when your Uncle Phil

44
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,481
bought these pieces-
- Oh, yes.

45
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,906
for a trip to Spain.

46
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:38,017
- My inheritance.

47
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,433
- Been all over the world, these pieces.

48
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:43,001
Your Uncle Phil, he was something else.

49
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,251
- Yes, Uncle Phil was a $3 bill, right?

50
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:52,041
- Oh, God, what's in here, bricks?

51
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,393
- Books.
(Barbara laughing)

52
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,346
- Teaching you to read,

53
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:57,505
that was my first mistake.

54
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,681
- Older sisters are a form of punishment,

55
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,977
you know that?
- Hah.

56
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:02,810
(glass banging)
(TV referee whistles tweeting)

57
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,696
- [Barney] Oh, all right, forget about it.

58
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:08,136
- No, you've been doing
this to me for 30 years.

59
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:10,680
First you tell me there's
a snake in my boot

60
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,072
and then you say forget I said anything.

61
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:14,800
You know, I really needed this.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,800
(faint jukebox music)
(TV football murmuring)

63
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:22,363
- Should you be drinking?
(glass thumping)

64
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,691
- I shouldn't be breathing.

65
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,811
- I'm not talking about your health,

66
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:26,556
I'm talking about your parole officer.

67
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:28,611
- He thinks I shouldn't
be breathing, either.

68
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:30,275
- Four years you were inside.

69
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,907
I keep telling people, "Bum rap,

70
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,592
they picked the wrong
Irishman out of the lineup."

71
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:34,785
Now this.

72
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:36,888
- Yeah, bum rap. (breath exhaling)

73
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:40,216
Jim Reilly, the greatest lover
in the whole neighborhood

74
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,299
has got AIDS!

75
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:44,600
Bad rap.

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
- Hey, do you mind?

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,682
You wanna empty out the place?

78
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,849
(faint jukebox music)

79
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:54,806
- I spend half my time now

80
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:56,870
trying to convince
people you aren't a fag.

81
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,510
- And the other half wondering, right?

82
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,798
- Mickey, when he asked me where you been,

83
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,926
I gotta tell him.

84
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,702
You moved into that convent
with a bunch of queers!

85
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:06,590
- Oh, so that's the reason
he ain't been around.

86
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,590
- What do you expect?

87
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,207
Moving in with a bunch of fags,

88
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:10,678
nobody's gonna be around.

89
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,342
- I don't really care.

90
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:15,198
The rents right and I got
the place all to myself.

91
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:17,718
They got nine queers,
two hookers and a junkie,

92
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,390
nobody bothers me. (laughing)

93
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,798
Ain't about to move no
fruitcake in with me. (laughing)

94
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:26,696
(glass clinking)

95
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:31,494
(faint jukebox music)
(TV football fans cheering)

96
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:33,327
- Jimmy, are you okay?

97
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,934
What does the doctor say?

98
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,926
- He says I'm right,

99
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:46,735
they're headaches.
(bar stool scrapping)

100
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,254
Oh.
(cigarette pack rustling)

101
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:51,590
- I'll see ya, Logan.

102
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,590
(jukebox music)
(feet shuffling)

103
00:05:57,006 --> 00:06:00,582
(beer glass shattering)

104
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:02,662
- All right, let it be.

105
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,662
Look here, come on, Jim!

106
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,302
Come on, now, cut it out!

107
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:09,969
(jukebox music)

108
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:15,052
- Gimme a glass of water, Logan.

109
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:23,826
(water gurgling)

110
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,948
(glass thumping)

111
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:29,799
To your health.

112
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,466
(jukebox music)

113
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,358
(glasses clinking)

114
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,150
You better break those, too.

115
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,334
- What's the matter with you!

116
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,167
(glass shattering)

117
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,558
You got no right to treat Logan like that!

118
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:47,342
I still like to come in
here once in a while!

119
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:48,702
- Yeah, well, do me a favor,

120
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,974
go back there and tell Logan I'm adopted!

121
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:51,807
There's no reason you shouldn't

122
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,918
still be allowed in this toilet!

123
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,022
(door squeaking)
(jukebox music)

124
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:58,854
- Hey, Jimmy, where ya going?

125
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:01,437
(car rumbling)

126
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:10,758
(car humming)
(car horn blaring)

127
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:13,758
- Ah, quit blowing you're diddy bag!

128
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:17,549
- Oh, damn, damn, wait!
(car horn honking)

129
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,333
- [Car Driver] Watch it, lady!

130
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,237
(car horn blaring)

131
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:22,421
- Oh, wait, oh, my God!

132
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,813
I'm glad you don't have
a driver's license.

133
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,685
- It's the pill, I took it.

134
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,757
- Yeah, well, the pill
has a faint smell of beer.

135
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:30,453
- Oh. (laughing)

136
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,117
You noticed that, too, huh?
(traffic humming)

137
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,757
- I just got a couple of job listings

138
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,093
you might be interested in.

139
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,237
It wouldn't hurt you-
- Oh. (groaning)

140
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,685
- To try and pay some rent, you know.

141
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,648
- Don't you ever give up.
(police siren wailing)

142
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:44,536
- An electronics warehouse
needs an inventory control man.

143
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:45,768
- Oh, great.

144
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,552
First VCR that turns up missing,

145
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,280
guess who gets to wear handcuffs?

146
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,872
- Well, a print shop needs a compositor.

147
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:52,705
- I'm too old,

148
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,208
those places are all
into computers nowadays.

149
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,576
- Oh no, this is a
letterpress shop. (laughing)

150
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:00,288
Oh, Eldon, ah, (throat clearing)

151
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,392
the clinic van will be swinging by here

152
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:05,112
Monday, Wednesdays and Saturday mornings.

153
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:05,945
- Thank God.

154
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:10,040
- Gee, Eldon, you finally get
to rest your little wings.

155
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,217
Woo-oo, Eldon, woo! (laughing)

156
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:15,720
- He doesn't belong here.

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,576
- You have to know how to take him.

158
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:18,736
- How?

159
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,720
Half stewed most of the time,

160
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,592
TV blaring all night

161
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:23,592
and then he's got the nerve

162
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,592
to try to borrow pain pills.

163
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,392
Enough is enough,

164
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:29,352
and I'm not the only one.

165
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:32,320
- Things may be about to change, Eldon.

166
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,344
Give it a chance.

167
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:34,177
Hi, Norma.

168
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,608
Okay, what about the print shop?

169
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:37,896
- Have a lovely evening, Eldon.

170
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:40,512
- C'mon, what about the print shop?

171
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,856
- Actually, I'm thinking
of entering the priesthood.

172
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,397
Hm?
- Oh, that's good,

173
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,392
good priest.

174
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,108
Come on, in.

175
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,858
Hup, 2-3-4!

176
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:56,329
- Come on in.
(feet shuffling)

177
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:02,280
- Jim, you keep this place
looking like a swap meet.

178
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,886
- Yeah?
(TV basketball game murmuring)

179
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:05,814
What can I interest you in, huh?

180
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,147
Ball cap, one size fits all.

181
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:11,174
Oh, it's you.

182
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,502
- Do you remember what
I told you last week?

183
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:14,438
- What?
(TV basketball game murmuring)

184
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,878
Hey, come on, line, it's a foul!

185
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:20,767
He was going for the basket.

186
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,006
Hey, Lisa, don't do that.

187
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,943
Hey, Lisa!
(TV referees whistling)

188
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:29,166
Come on, administrators
don't do maid's work!

189
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:29,999
- Uh!

190
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,751
- Come on, you're trying to shame me, huh?

191
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,430
All right, it worked.

192
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,263
- Good!

193
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,096
Then do me a favor,

194
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,814
try and keep this
apartment halfway sanitary,

195
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:39,481
you're about to have a roommate.

196
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:41,231
- What?

197
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:43,766
No, you can't do this to me.

198
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:44,926
- Yes, I can.

199
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:47,214
I'm not a maid, I'm the administrator

200
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,326
and I told you about this a week ago.

201
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:52,262
- This, this is not going to happen.

202
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:53,654
- It's happened

203
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,102
and don't sound like I'm
asking you for a favor.

204
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:58,214
This is something you've needed, Jim.

205
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,806
- You're asking for bloodshed!

206
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:02,038
You ready for that, huh?
(luggage thumping)

207
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,623
There's no way I'm gonna share this place

208
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:08,094
with some damn fairy!
(Lisa throat clearing)

209
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:10,927
- Jim Reilly, this is Bill Thomas.

210
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:15,598
Um, in the last year
Bill has been helping us

211
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,934
addressing civic and professional groups

212
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:20,134
on the ramifications of AIDS.

213
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:23,478
- Well, I think that's just wonderful!

214
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:24,334
- Other than that,

215
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:25,510
I think people should say

216
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,118
what they want about themselves, right?

217
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,814
- All right, I'll go first.

218
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:34,231
I'm an ex-con on parole for bank robbery.

219
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:39,179
- Well, I certainly can't top that.

220
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:43,902
- Look, we might as well get
something straight up front.

221
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,790
I ain't no fag.

222
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,214
I got AIDS from a blood transfusion

223
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,047
and I don't really care

224
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,494
what kinda crap you hand 'em

225
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,662
at those civic and professional groups.

226
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,230
It is my firm conviction

227
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,686
that AIDS is God's way of cleaning house,

228
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,102
including me, pal.

229
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,852
It's God's way of cleaning house.

230
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:05,830
- Well, I see even God doesn't do windows.

231
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,838
- That's good,

232
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,422
you've opened up lines of communication.

233
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,022
I'll check in on you tomorrow.

234
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,422
You look tired.

235
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,127
- We'll speak tomorrow.
(TV basketball murmuring)

236
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,735
Ciao.
- Ciao.

237
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:16,782
- Ciao.

238
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:19,886
(door knocking)

239
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,886
- Hi, is there a William Thomas here?

240
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:22,958
- Yes, that's me.

241
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,486
- Where do you want this stuff?

242
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:25,526
- Right in there,

243
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,790
the little room with all the noise.

244
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,510
I took the big one in back.

245
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,742
First come, first serve, right?

246
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,214
- Well, it's exactly what I would've done.

247
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,150
(luggage thumping)

248
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,067
Of course, I have a selfish nature.

249
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:39,015
Thank you.

250
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:43,353
(door slamming)

251
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,827
(TV basketball game murmuring)

252
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:51,577
- I can tell you right now,

253
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,386
there ain't gonna be no gay rights parades

254
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,886
in and outta here!

255
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,177
You hear me?

256
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,017
- How could I not.

257
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,145
- [Jim] Ya hear me?

258
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,897
- Quite clearly.

259
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:03,690
- Good!
(TV basketball game murmuring)

260
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,857
Quite clearly.

261
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:10,089
And don't expect the world
to stop around here, either,

262
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,589
just because you decide to go night-night.

263
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:20,105
You like basketball?
(quiet piano music)

264
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:21,188
- Not really.

265
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,673
- [Jim] Football?

266
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:24,506
- Nope.

267
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,626
- [Jim] No baseball either, right?

268
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:29,459
- Right.

269
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,153
- [Jim] Golf, I suppose.

270
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,594
- Tennis.

271
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,761
- [Jim] Well, if you
plan on sticking around,

272
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,233
you better get your own TV.

273
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,400
I don't watch much tennis.

274
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:50,296
(Bill sighing)

275
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:56,394
(garbage truck rumbling)

276
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,402
Mm, ah. (sighing)

277
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:15,490
Uh.

278
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:21,930
Ah.

279
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,748
(garbage truck rumbling)

280
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:43,953
Yo, you up!

281
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:50,627
All right, reveille, rise and shine!

282
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,210
Here's how it goes.

283
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:54,048
Number one,

284
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:59,651
don't wake up all bright and cheerful

285
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:01,339
and expect a lotta conversation

286
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,907
because I don't do much
talking before noon.

287
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:09,075
Number two, if you see any
of my stuff lying around,

288
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,907
don't do me any favors by putting 'em away

289
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,963
'cause it's hands off
private property around here.

290
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,046
Number three,

291
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:19,410
hey, you gettin' all this?

292
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:23,243
You hear me?

293
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:25,499
(foot stomping)

294
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,832
All right, look,

295
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,843
if you're still a little put out

296
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,467
'cause I was kinda rough on ya last night,

297
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,743
don't be.

298
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:34,907
I get these headaches, see,

299
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,574
and well, when I do,

300
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:38,348
I'm just warning ya,

301
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:39,955
stay the hell outta my way.

302
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:40,955
Fair enough?

303
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:50,793
(door squeaking)

304
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:58,579
(door slamming)

305
00:14:58,579 --> 00:14:59,451
- [Receptionist] Thank you for calling,

306
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:00,819
Seattle AIDS Alliance, can I help you?

307
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,514
- It was a rather disastrous
first night in the apartment.

308
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:03,347
- What happened?

309
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:05,079
- I'm going to move out.

310
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,271
- You just moved in yesterday.

311
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,351
- I know, I know, but look,
(door clicking)

312
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,487
you can call it snobbery

313
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,919
but I call it self preservation.

314
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,735
I just don't think that
it's fair to him or to me.

315
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,047
The vibe is just too awful

316
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,855
and I can still get my old
apartment back if I hurry

317
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:23,295
and maybe you'll have another
opening before too long,

318
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:24,128
right?

319
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:27,479
- Look, I've got a problem with Jim.

320
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,255
Nobody really wants to room with him

321
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:30,575
or even have him there.

322
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,255
- That doesn't really stun me.

323
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,191
- It's a protective coloration he puts on.

324
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:38,007
- Yes, it's quite effective, too.

325
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,615
- I thought if anyone could get behind it,

326
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,319
it would be you.

327
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,087
He really needs the help.

328
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:48,015
- Ah, you overestimate me.
(hand slapping)

329
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,182
- No, I don't.

330
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:53,460
You see, I think you need him, too.

331
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:57,767
- One more time?

332
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,503
- I've watched you,

333
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,879
when you speak about straights with AIDS,

334
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,727
there's an edge to your voice.

335
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,329
It's, it's like a bitterness

336
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,577
that maybe you're glad
that this terrible thing

337
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:12,160
seeped over to the
other side of the fence.

338
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:22,589
- (sighing) That's a, that's
a horrible thing to say.

339
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,422
(door clicking)

340
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:24,255
- [Receptionist] Sir, sir-

341
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,088
- Yeah, just like I thought!

342
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:25,921
- Sir, you can't go in there!
(door slamming)

343
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,863
You couldn't wait to
get your heads together

344
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,983
to find a way to put old
Jim out in a dumpster!

345
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:31,816
- Hold it.

346
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:32,791
- No, you hold it!

347
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,255
You think just because I'm living there

348
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,815
on a temporarily rent free basis,

349
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:37,991
you can just waltz in there

350
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,447
with a wad of bucks in your pocket-

351
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:40,280
- Oh, please.

352
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,287
- And take the place over for yourself!

353
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,983
Well, no way, Billy boy-
- When you get through-

354
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:43,975
- No way!
- Frothing at the mouth,

355
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:44,808
will you just open your ears

356
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,015
and listen for a minute.

357
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,928
There is no way I'm spending
two consecutive days

358
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,967
under the same roof as some
John Dillinger wanna be!

359
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,623
- Good, because I don't wanna-
- Stop it, stop it!

360
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,391
Stop it, stop it, both of you!

361
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,775
I am not the reservation
clerk at the Ritz!

362
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,072
That is a two bedroom apartment,

363
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,143
and I've got a waiting
list from here to the ocean

364
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:02,607
of people who wish they were so lucky.

365
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,310
Now, either you both give it a try

366
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,517
or you can both take a walk.

367
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,397
Take it or leave it right now.

368
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:13,314
(distant police siren wailing)

369
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,285
- (sighing) All right, Lisa,

370
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,717
in the spirit of fairness,

371
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,221
I was thinking that I should allow Jim

372
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,611
to be a little bit closer to
his beloved television set

373
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:30,933
by giving him the smaller front bedroom.

374
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,085
- No!
(hand slamming)

375
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,173
N-O!

376
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:34,277
- [Bill] Why not?

377
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:36,373
- Because as I was there
first, that's why not.

378
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:37,381
- Oh, very mature.

379
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:38,214
Very mature.

380
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:40,184
- Listen, you, you ever been away?

381
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,048
Huh, you ever done time?

382
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:42,584
- Ah, what does that
have to do with anything?

383
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:44,504
- Because if you had you'd know,

384
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,600
in stir you don't just walk in,

385
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,928
you gotta earn your place, Billy!

386
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,200
- Yeah, well, we're not in stir, Jimmy.

387
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,033
- Aw, screw this,

388
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,158
I can't talk to this guy!
- Forget about this, Lisa.

389
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,840
- Why, why don't we flip a coin

390
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,448
to see who gets the front bedroom?

391
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,480
- Because it's my bedroom!
- Just drop it, okay?

392
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,980
- Think how smug you'll feel when you win.

393
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,104
(Bill sighing)

394
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,520
- (sighing) You gotta coin?

395
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,248
- I've got a coin.

396
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:15,165
(traffic rumbling)

397
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,336
- You know, actually, I'm
gonna like it up there

398
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:24,840
in that little front room.
(luggage wheels rumbling)

399
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,488
I haven't been sleeping
worth a hoot back here.

400
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:30,112
Oh, when I was in stir

401
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:32,792
one of the things I missed
most were the sounds,

402
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,456
you know, the traffic noises.

403
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,520
That's the kinda music
I can go to sleep by.

404
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,784
- I'm happy to oblige
a fellow music lover.

405
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:44,784
- Ah, so, ah, what kind of
degree did you say you had?

406
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:46,152
- Master's degree.

407
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,568
- Mm, Master of what?

408
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:50,688
- Government policy.

409
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:52,688
Actually, I help groups and individuals

410
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,256
apply for government grants.

411
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:55,712
- Oh.

412
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,760
You and me, we're in
the same line of work,

413
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,608
stealing from the public.

414
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,848
Mr. Neat.

415
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,123
- That's right.

416
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:05,432
I also hang my shirts with
their collars buttoned.

417
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,000
- Hey, your secret's safe with me.

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
(blankets thumping)

419
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,073
Hm?

420
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:18,640
Oh, it was a knife fight three years ago.

421
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,192
The other guy had the knife.

422
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,608
- Oh.

423
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,740
- When they were sewing me back up,

424
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,980
I had an out of body experience.

425
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,692
Yeah, it's like I, I came out of my body

426
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,284
and I hovered over them

427
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:32,452
and I could see 'em working on me

428
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,684
and I heard this voice say,

429
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,601
"Not yet, Jim, not yet"

430
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,167
and then I floated back down to,

431
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,100
what, you don't believe me?

432
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,437
- Ah, I believe that you believe it.

433
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,270
(bag rattling)

434
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,852
It's the best that I can do.

435
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,572
- Well, it happened.

436
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:48,739
- Sure it did.

437
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,588
You know how to work one of these?

438
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:53,308
- What's to know?

439
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:54,975
I hate those things.

440
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,647
- What's the matter?

441
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:04,676
- Oh, the jackhammers are starting again.

442
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:07,660
- Do you have any pills for that?

443
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,188
- Yeah, I got one.

444
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,748
I don't wanna take it till I'm dying!

445
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:14,852
Lisa, she hides the rest of 'em for me.

446
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:15,685
When it gets too bad,

447
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:19,518
I call her and she tells
me where to find one.

448
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:23,860
(laughing) She's got the
map to Treasure Island.

449
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,884
- Why don't you take one now?

450
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,301
- No, sometimes it goes away.

451
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:36,681
(sighing) Oh, God!

452
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,413
(telephone beeping)

453
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,246
Oh!

454
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,195
(sighing) Mm.

455
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:51,028
What about you, Billy?

456
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:54,699
What's lowered you to
this station in life?

457
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:57,396
(hand thumping)

458
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:59,505
That pneumonia stuff, huh?

459
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:01,489
- Yeah, I've been taking
aerosolized pentamidine

460
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:03,897
trying to keep it from coming back.

461
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:06,962
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

462
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,681
- Well, look on the bright side,

463
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,945
at least you can pronounce it.

464
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:16,745
- Don't they know what's
causing your headaches?

465
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:18,674
- I don't wanna know.

466
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:22,257
Talking about illness makes people sick.

467
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:24,660
Let's go, let's get outta here.

468
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,660
(traffic rumbling)
(shoppers murmuring)

469
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:31,349
- What's in here.

470
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:36,740
There's enough salt in this
to start your own ocean.

471
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,400
- Man does not live by cauliflower alone.

472
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,716
(traffic rumbling)

473
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,506
- [Male Shopper] Look at
that, some horseradish.

474
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,399
- [Female Shopper] Oh,
yeah, I see what you mean.

475
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:52,495
(traffic rumbling)
(shoppers murmuring)

476
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:53,662
- Hey, Mickey!

477
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,727
- Hey, Jim.

478
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,011
Hey, how you been?

479
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,095
- Well, pick up a phone and find out.

480
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:01,319
- Yeah, well, you know.

481
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,569
- Yeah, I know.

482
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:06,122
You're getting a belly!
(hand thumping)

483
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:08,789
(both laughing)

484
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,049
- So, what gives?

485
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,873
You know, your dad says
you moved into that place,

486
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:16,770
you know, with those guys.

487
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,474
What, are you nuts?

488
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:21,769
- Bill Thomas, Mickey O'Neill.

489
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:23,184
- Hi.

490
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:25,514
- [Male Shopper] Pete,
where's the broccoli?

491
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,643
- So, when we gonna shoot some pool?

492
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,658
Yeah, I need, I need donations.

493
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:31,419
- I left my cue over my old man's.

494
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,834
We had a fight and I haven't been back.

495
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:34,667
- Oh, man.

496
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,868
Oh, you know, eat some crow.

497
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:36,763
You know, go get your cue,

498
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:38,955
I'll see you on the table.

499
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:43,038
Look, I gotta go.
(hand thumping)

500
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:45,819
- See you at the table.
(keys jingling)

501
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:47,411
- [Mickey] Yeah.

502
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:50,491
(door thumping)
(car revving)

503
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,867
(car rumbling)
(wheels squealing)

504
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:55,140
- Sorry if I tainted your reputation.

505
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,963
- Well, I don't taint easy.
(door thumping)

506
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:59,630
(phone ringing)

507
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,420
(feet shuffling)
(door clicking)

508
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,891
(phone message bleeping)

509
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,531
- [Barbara] Hi, Bill.

510
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,563
Bill?
(buttons clicking)

511
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,347
Bill, are ya there?
(door clicking)

512
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:15,115
It's Barbara, surprise.
(phone message bleeping)

513
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:16,420
- What are you doing?

514
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,763
- This thing is screwy.
(tape rewind squealing)

515
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,132
Some dame was talking,

516
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:19,965
a Barbara somebody.

517
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:20,798
- My sister.

518
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,049
What'd she say?

519
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:22,882
- I don't know.

520
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,117
- What did you erase it?
(phone message bleeping)

521
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:24,950
- So, sue me.

522
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,076
- Well, why don't you just
leave this thing alone,

523
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:26,909
all right?

524
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:27,742
Please, just don't touch it.

525
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:28,575
- Hey, you know,

526
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,093
nobody asked you to
bring this thing in here.

527
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:32,740
This is my phone with my number

528
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,780
and I don't really appreciate

529
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,964
having my friends call-
- Really?

530
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:35,797
and get a message-
- And how many-

531
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:36,630
from some stranger!
- Of your friends-

532
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,463
Have bothered to dial your number

533
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:38,565
because your phone hasn't rung once

534
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:39,937
since I've been here!

535
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:40,785
- Shove it!

536
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:42,368
- Oh, how original.

537
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:45,137

(referee whistle tweeting)
(crowd roaring)

539
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,977
- [Game Announcer] It's
Keith, Keith to Johnson.

540
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,729
Johnson with a beautiful pass to Barrows

541
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:56,161
and Barrows from the three point!

542
00:23:56,161 --> 00:24:01,161
(trash can thumping)
(thunder rumbling)

543
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,041
Pete Johnson is on point tonight,

544
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,977
he's already had 12
points in the first half.

545
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,473
(referee whistles tweeting)

546
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:13,209
Okay, Keith to Johnson.
(beer cans rattling)

547
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:14,130
Oh, and floor scrap
(papers rustling)

548
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,797
with seconds to go on the night.

549
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,834
(basketball crowd roaring)

550
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,711
- Oh, man.

551
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:33,029
- [Game Announcer] Johnson's
really taking off here.

552
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,415
Coming in from North Carolina
State, he set's back.

553
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:40,606
He's been on the Seattle's
team for three years.

554
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,189
- Made you a salad.

555
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:46,237
Take it, helps prevent night blindness,

556
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:47,546
beriberi and scurvy.
(thunder rumbling)

557
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:49,290
- [Game Announcer] Up over the center line

558
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,026
and Jackson draws another jumper,

559
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:53,523
great shot.
(basketball crowd murmuring)

560
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:55,810
- How's your stew.

561
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,893
- Needs salt.

562
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,650
(Bill chuckling)
(thunder rumbling)

563
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:08,541
Well, last thing I need
right now is scurvy.

564
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,650
- Listen, I'm sorry about
the telephone business.

565
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,594
- Yeah, forget it.
(basketball game murmuring)

566
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,594
- I never used to have such a short fuse,

567
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:17,011
it's not like me.

568
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:21,667
- People shoulda knew us when, huh?

569
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:25,210
- Seeing people running
around like that, (coughing)

570
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,954
I try to remember what it felt like.

571
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:28,370
- Yeah, look at the ref,

572
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,330
he must run 100 miles a night.

573
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,003
(door buzzing)
(referee whistles tweeting)

574
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,666
- I'll get it.

575
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,674
- [Game Announcer] Hamilton
on the three point line-

576
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:40,722
(feet thumping)
(door squeaking)

577
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:43,002
- [Bill] Barb, what are you doing here?

578
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:43,835
- Didn't you get my message?

579
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,006
- No, not at all.
- Oh.

580
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:45,897
- C'mon in,

581
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,922
the machine's been acting up.

582
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,658
Tim Reilly, this is my
sister, Barbara Thomas.

583
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,202
- Well, I can see you wanna have

584
00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:54,618
a little family titty-tat,

585
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:56,890
so I'm gonna take a walk.

586
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,010
- It's raining.

587
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,298
- Yeah.
(basketball game murmuring)

588
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:00,826
Yeah, when I was in prison,

589
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:01,914
one of the things I missed most

590
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:04,082
was walking in the rain.

591
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,930
- Happy to have met you, Mr. Reilly.

592
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,930
- Same here.

593
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,283
Oh, let me guess.

594
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:14,418
Single lady, attractive,

595
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:19,517
master's degree in business
administration, I'll bet.

596
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:23,349
You're the top rep, 13 Eastern states,

597
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,849
for a bra company.

598
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:28,693
- (laughing) Oh, nothing
quite so sexy, I'm afraid.

599
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:31,797
I work as a customer rep for an airline.

600
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:33,605
- Well, you're still attractive.

601
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,333
At least I got that, right.

602
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,166
- [Game Announcer] So,
to get to the play-off,

603
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,249
from the foul line, three point shot!

604
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,556
- Well. (laughing)

605
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:46,306
(rain splashing)

606
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:52,774

(rain splashing)
(blues saxophone music)

612
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:51,571
- Oh, I haven't got any,

613
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:53,500
if you want some I can maybe get it.

614
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,167
- Yeah, well, I'll let you know.

615
00:27:57,448 --> 00:27:58,281
- Mm.

616
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,575
(rain splashing)
(players murmuring)

617
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:07,158

(car horn blaring)

620
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,407

621
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:34,159
(tires screeching)
(horn honking)

622
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,900
- [2nd Car Driver] Look out, you idiot!

623
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,694
- Ah, shut up!

624
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:40,861
- [2nd Car Driver] Ah, screw you, pal!

625
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,920
(blues saxophone music)
(rain pounding)

626
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:06,106
(Jim choking)
(hand pounding)

627
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:15,506
(door squeaking)
(door slamming)

628
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:18,174

(thunder rumbling)

630
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:27,680

00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,810
(TV remote thumping)
(referee whistles tweeting)

633
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,984
- [Game Announcer]
Perkins, who's the center

634
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:36,108
from North Carolina State,

635
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,091
fourth draft choice,

636
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,298
bringing the ball up over the center line.

637
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:41,566
A top player over these last two years,

638
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:43,492
Perkins passes over to Williams,

639
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:44,444
(Bill coughing)

640
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:45,728
Williams for the lay-up, great shot.

641
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:49,032

- (coughing) Yes.

645
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,400
Hold on.
(door squeaking)

646
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,796
Sorry if I'm disturbing,

647
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,900
my...
(hand thumping)

648
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,917
- I see you've got your own drug store.

649
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,676
- Nothing very good for pain, I'm afraid.

650
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:16,093
- No, I, I was just wondering
if you needed anything?

651
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,445
- No, thanks.

652
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:20,331
- All right.
(basketball game murmuring)

653
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:22,691
- [Game Announcer] Johnson
got off a great shot,

654
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:26,635
right up the middle, it was a great shot.

655
00:30:26,635 --> 00:30:29,218
(Bill sighing)

656
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,064
(Bill coughing)

657
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:39,643
(thunder rumbling)

658
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:41,609
- I've got it turned down
so low now I need captions.

659
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,450
- [Game Announcer] And he has
the ball going all the way-

660
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,283
- Oh, that's fine,

661
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:46,703
I'm just having a little
difficulty breathing tonight.

662
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:47,536
- [Game Announcer] Straight up-

663
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:48,543
- [Jim] Did you take your medicine?

664
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:49,376
That stuff?

665
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:50,209
- Yeah.

666
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:54,976
- I'm sorry about your sister,

667
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,656
I hope I didn't shake her up too bad.

668
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:59,320
- Ah, you did in a way.
- Up for a lay-up-

669
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,873
Surprising, I always think
of her as the ice lady.

670
00:31:02,873 --> 00:31:04,361
- Yeah.

671
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,444
What's the, um, the book?

672
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:09,528
- "Moby Dick", Melville.

673
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:12,184
- You brought a lotta books with ya.

674
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:14,025
- Oh, just the ones that I want around me

675
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:15,275
when I, well...

676
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:18,775
- At the end, huh?

677
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:20,322
Well...

678
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:22,010
- I still have problems saying it.

679
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,843
- Not me, I just don't believe it.

680
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:28,706
- Guess these are my way of escaping.

681
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:30,882
I used to travel quite a bit,

682
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:33,360
it's not so easy anymore.
- Mm.

683
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,841
- (throat clearing) It's
funny how certain books

684
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:38,758
can really, really take you places.

685
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,248
- (laughing) You sound like
an ad for the public library.

686
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:46,353
- (laughing) Yeah.

687
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:47,968
Have you ever been on the ocean?

688
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,081
- Yeah, oh yeah.

689
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,352
Yeah, my old man, he was
a sailmaker back when.

690
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:53,769
- Listen to this.

691
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:58,345
"With the landless gull that
at sunset folds her wings

692
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:01,128
and is rocked to sleep between billows,

693
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,176
so, at nightfall the Nantucketer,

694
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:05,416
out of side of land, furls his sails

695
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,568
and lays him to his rest

696
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:09,425
while under his very pillow

697
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,905
rush herds of walruses and whales."

698
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:17,184
(rain splashing)
(thunder rumbling)

699
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,767
- Hm, yeah, ah, it's all right.

700
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:26,752
(Bill coughing)

701
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:30,835
- Well, I think I'm gonna
try and get some sleep.

702
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:35,759
Good night.
- Night.

703
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,217
- [Game Announcer] Going to King,

704
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,232
King up over the center line.

705
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:42,832
King dances around Johnson

706
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:43,849
and he's up for the lay-up!
(basketball fans cheering)

707
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:45,516
Great shot for King.

708
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:52,561
(quiet music)
(rain splashing)

709
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:12,777
(feet thudding)
(traffic humming)

710
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:23,928
- (whistling) Man, you
look like you just stepped

711
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:26,584
outta one of them clothes catalogs.

712
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:27,584
- Thank you.

713
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:31,577
- In my neighborhood that's
considered an insult.

714
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:34,952
- Oh, ho-ho, that's funny.
(Jim laughing)

715
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:35,800
Listen, if anyone calls,

716
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,368
will you tell 'em at the
University Women's Club.

717
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:39,201
- You know, I don't get it.

718
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,184
You, you get all duded up

719
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,544
so you can look like nothing's wrong,

720
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:42,377
(door thumping)

721
00:33:42,377 --> 00:33:43,624
you can stand up in
front of a buncha people

722
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:44,457
and talk about a disease

723
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,736
that nobody wants to even mention.

724
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:47,569
- Somewhere in there

725
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,056
I think you answered your own question.

726
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,280
Would do you like to come?

727
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,353
- No, thanks.

728
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:52,936
- Hey Jim, hold on!

729
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:56,352
Brought your cue by.

730
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:59,161
- Thanks.
(car door thumping)

731
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:01,994
(traffic humming)

732
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,590
- I was in the neighborhood.

733
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:18,672
- Bill Thomas, my old man, Barney.

734
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:19,755
- Mr. Reilly.

735
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,360
- Well, this is a pretty nice place.

736
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:31,808
I see why you didn't wanna
stay with your old man.

737
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,656
- We don't do well in the same cage.

738
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,184
- Oh, so now my place is a cage.

739
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:36,017
- Oh, for Pete's sake,

740
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:37,040
will you cut it!

741
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,318
- Of course, it's an okay place to crash

742
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:39,151
when you can't see straight,

743
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:40,440
then it's okay.

744
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,960
- (sighing) Look, thanks
for bringing this by.

745
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,785
- Every once in a while I keep thinking

746
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:46,280
you'll catch me by surprise

747
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,057
and act like a son.

748
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:50,888
- I've been hearing the
same song since I was 13.

749
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,721
- Ah.

750
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:55,313
Oh, by the way, the last
time you used the car,

751
00:34:55,313 --> 00:34:56,440
you left the tank empty.

752
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,520
- Yeah?
(dog barking)

753
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,728
Well, I meant to put gas in.

754
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:03,280
- The road to Hell is
paved with good intentions.

755
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,480
- I never saw anyone who knew as much

756
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,513
about the road to Hell as you do.

757
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:08,344
- Always the big mouth.

758
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:10,888
- Look, look, thanks for bringing this by,

759
00:35:10,888 --> 00:35:13,776
I'll, I'll try and be over and see ya.

760
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:14,768
- I figure if you wait much longer

761
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:18,601
you won't have to come over at all, right?

762
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:19,434
Fine.

763
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:26,281
(traffic humming)
(dog barking)

764
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,777
- I take it he's a little put
out that you're living here.

765
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,120
- That's not it really,

766
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,544
mostly he's just scared.

767
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:37,144
See, he's, he's dying of cancer

768
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:40,394
and he's afraid I'll go before he does.

769
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,743
You hit the ball with this end.

770
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:47,976
- Community organizations like this one

771
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:49,368
have proved to be the real pioneers

772
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:50,790
in the struggle against AIDS.

773
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,623
(woman throat clearing)

774
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,312
Seriously, this is not a popular cause

775
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,391
in most levels of government,

776
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:58,327
but people like you in groups like this

777
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:01,503
have raised the issues
and demanded action.

778
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,295
People like you have provided

779
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,720
prevention and care services

780
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,023
to those who need it.

781
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:07,167
Thank you for coming.

782
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,839
I'll answer any questions
if, if you have them.

783
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:11,927
- I have a question.

784
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:12,767
- Yes.

785
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,991
- And I think it should be asked

786
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:16,769
before we continue to let these
hearts and flowers speeches

787
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:19,439
lead us to deplete our resources

788
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:22,720
while the reckless behavior
that spreads this disease

789
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,088
goes on as though nothing has happened.

790
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:28,136
Now I, for one, am quite frankly fed up

791
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,711
with the way these homosexuals persist

792
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:33,327
in flaunting their high risk living habits

793
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:35,047
and then come crying to us

794
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:38,993
once they discover, my oh my,
that they've been infected.

795
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:41,263
- My sentiments exactly!

796
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:43,727
That's exactly the way I felt, ma'am.

797
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:44,560
(women softly exclaiming)

798
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,959
That is, that's the way
I felt until I got AIDS

799
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,176
and believe me,

800
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:51,599
I'm as straight as you
can get without a license.

801
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,919
(women laughing)

802
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,143
I like your dress.

803
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,591
(women laughing)

804
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:57,424
Yeah, that's right,

805
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,816
I got AIDS from a blood transfusion

806
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:02,016
in that wonderful sterile hospital

807
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:04,735
not 20 blocks from where you sit.

808
00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:05,568
Am I mad?

809
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:08,719
You're damn right I'm mad.

810
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,584
Do I need help?

811
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:13,999
Never before in my life until right now.

812
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:14,832
Once you get it,

813
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,135
you start grabbing for
the newspaper every day

814
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,639
to see if they found the answer to AIDS,

815
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,248
the magic bullet.

816
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:22,528
You don't reach for the funnies

817
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:25,407
or the sports page first anymore

818
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:27,455
and then you sorta realize

819
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:29,615
that the answer's gonna come from places

820
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:30,807
just like this.

821
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:33,031
From people like you who wanna know

822
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:33,902
and who aren't ready to take

823
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:36,526
"I don't know" for an answer.

824
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:38,337
You know, my grandma used to say

825
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:39,642
they used to tell kids they got the mumps

826
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:40,938
because they talked too much.

827
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:43,688
(women laughing)

828
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,602
Yeah, I said, "Andy, you
know, I can't find my shoes"

829
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:48,435
you know. (laughing)

830
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,338
- Oh, it was really good, yeah.

831
00:37:49,338 --> 00:37:50,459
(all laughing)

832
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:51,445
Oh, this looks like we're leaving you.

833
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,278
- Oh.

834
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:53,819
- See ya later.
- Nice meeting you.

835
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:56,244
- Good night. (throat clearing)

836
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:58,043
- Hey, come on, lighten-up, will ya?

837
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,252
I'm sorry I crabbed your act.

838
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:00,283
- So you went, "I like your dress."

839
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:01,395
- Hey, it's gonna get a laugh, isn't it?

840
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:03,203
- This is my not the laugh circuit,

841
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:04,435
these meetings are serious business.

842
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:07,435
These people come to be
informed, not amused.

843
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,459
They don't come to hear
some hammy, homey parables

844
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:10,963
about kids with mumps.

845
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:12,267
- It doesn't hurt to let
'em think we're human,

846
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,923
does it?

847
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:15,003
- Get in.
(door clicking)

848
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:15,955
- I tell you what?
(women murmuring)

849
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:17,403
Why don't you just go to hell?

850
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:19,820
I'm gonna go shoot some pool.

851
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:26,808
(car engine rumbling)
(car door slamming)

852
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:34,721
(door squeaking)
(TV basketball murmuring)

853
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:35,994
- [Game Announcer]
Something Seattle's lacking-

854
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:36,827
(briefcase thumping)

855
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,170
Is a strong forward to post up.

856
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,763
Someone who's decent with post passes-

857
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:43,914
(TV remote clicking)

858
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,897
(TV remote clicking)
(basketball game murmuring)

859
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:47,369
(fans cheering)

860
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,297
Something that Seattle's
not been able to do

861
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:50,905
is get the ball into the post area.

862
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,822
(doorbell buzzing)

863
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,863
(footsteps thudding)
(referee whistles tweeting)

864
00:38:59,863 --> 00:39:01,295
Oh, man, look at this,

865
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:02,903
straight-up the floor play-

866
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:04,511
(door squeaking)

867
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,428
- Oh, uh...

868
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:09,271
Mr. Thomas, right?

869
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:10,647
- Right.

870
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,480
- Is, uh, is Jim here?

871
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,495
- No, I'm sorry, he's not.

872
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:19,088
- Oh, is he due back soon,

873
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:19,959
do you know?

874
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:20,792
- Well, he didn't say.

875
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,631
You're welcome to come in

876
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:22,464
and wait if you'd like.

877
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:24,559
- No, ah, no, no, I,

878
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,399
I mean, who knows when
he'll be back, right?

879
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,744
- Can I give him a message?

880
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:29,661
- Um, yeah.

881
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,959
Um, when I was here before

882
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,079
I meant to ask him

883
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,439
where it was I should take the car

884
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,751
to get the, my breaks fixed-

885
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:37,584
- Right.
- On the car, you know.

886
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,034
- Well, I'll ask him to give you a call.

887
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,242
- Uh, you know, I'm sorry I sorta blew up

888
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:46,523
in front of you earlier, Mr. Thomas,

889
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:50,606
but Jim and I used to be
a lotta laughs together.

890
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,850
I don't know what happened.

891
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,322
I, I meant no offense about your place-

892
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:58,643
- Oh, please don't let it
bother you, Mr. Reilly.

893
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:00,978
- The last time I was called Mr. Reilly,

894
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,162
it was a cop giving me a ticket.

895
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:03,995
Barney.

896
00:40:03,995 --> 00:40:04,882
- Bill.

897
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:05,715
- Bill.

898
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:11,387
You know, Jim's a good boy, really,

899
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,394
just never had a helluva
lotta respect for authority.

900
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:14,874
I mean, never!

901
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:17,082
- Barney, you sound
exactly like my father.

902
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,106
(Barney laughing)
(Barney coughing)

903
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:24,189
- Ah, well, sorta like a
club, I guess, father's.

904
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:26,099
- I just remembered,

905
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,618
Jim said that he was
going to shoot some pool.

906
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:31,535
- Oh, well, he'll be a while, then.

907
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:34,986
I hope he doesn't drink too much,

908
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:38,603
on account of those headaches he gets.

909
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,698
Will you do me a favor,

910
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,602
you tell him.

911
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:44,618
I mean, from me it doesn't count.

912
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:46,114
- Do you know where he plays?

913
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:47,490
- Ah, at Grandview's over on Gates,

914
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,058
the old place.

915
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:54,058
(jukebox blues music)
(pool players murmuring)

916
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:03,426
(balls clinking)
(pool players murmuring)

917
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,650
- Will someone hit me with a card?

918
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,522
Don't take all day.

919
00:41:09,522 --> 00:41:11,274
- [Pool Player] Easy one to sink.

920
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:13,131
- [Player 2] Oh, I don't
know, I haven't been there.

921
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:17,010
- [Player 3] It's a town right there.

922
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:21,314
- [Player 4] Oh, good
shot, very good shot.

923
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,810
- [Player 3] I don't anyone
else who would see that.

924
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,082
It'd be great if we played pool together.

925
00:41:27,082 --> 00:41:29,749
Say, don't ya think?
- Oh, c'mon!

926
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:35,612
- [Player 4] Anyway-
- It's a scam, I think.

927
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:36,660
(player laughing)

928
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,870
- Hi there.

929
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,470
- Hi.

930
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,387
- You lost?

931
00:41:42,228 --> 00:41:44,895
- I thought you might need this.

932
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:49,102
- Thanks.

933
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:50,278
(jukebox blues music)
(players murmuring)

934
00:41:50,278 --> 00:41:52,598
- Hey, Jimmy, now you got a partner,

935
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:56,450
whatd'ya say we get down
to some serious betting?

936
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,373
- (laughing) I don't think so.

937
00:41:57,373 --> 00:41:58,229
- Yeah, yeah, no, no, no,

938
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,005
Bill Thomas, right?
- Yeah.

939
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,645
- Yeah, Millard Yanke.

940
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,029
Grab yourself a stick.

941
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:03,862
- Millard?

942
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,998
- No cracks, Millard was
my mother's piano teacher.

943
00:42:07,998 --> 00:42:09,333
I don't play piano.

944
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,973
- No, no, it's, uh, it's a unusual name.

945
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:14,109
Actually, I have a friend named Millard.

946
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:14,942
- Oh, yeah?

947
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:15,775
- Yeah.

948
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:16,957
- Well, now you got two
friends named Millard,

949
00:42:16,957 --> 00:42:18,526
only this one's about to become co-owner

950
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:20,359
of your house and car.

951
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:23,277
- Okay, one game for charity,

952
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:24,445
okay, but that's it.

953
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:27,612
- No way, buck a ball, same as always.

954
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:32,301
- You ever play this before?

955
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,069
- What, what do they call the white ball?

956
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,333
- You break.
(balls clanking)

957
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,666
You, uh, take the white ball

958
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,463
and you put it anywhere you like

959
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:43,517
behind those spots.

960
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:44,941
- [Jim] Yeah, right in there, yeah.

961
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:46,029
- It's fine.
- Johnny!

962
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,109
- Just hit it easy, okay?

963
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:47,942
Don't jab it.

964
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:50,060
- You don't wanna chip
the balls. (laughing)

965
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,038
- [Pool Player] Play to seven?
- Yeah.

966
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:54,705
(both laughing)

967
00:42:56,872 --> 00:42:59,408
(balls clacking)

968
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:02,575
(jukebox blues music)

969
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:05,989
- It's, (sputtering) lucky.
(Jim laughing)

970
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,035
(Bill throat clearing)

971
00:43:07,035 --> 00:43:10,876
- [Pool Player] They've got
a game going over there.

972
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:14,202
(balls thudding)

973
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:16,535
- Jimmy, you set me up, man.

974
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:21,676
- [Bill] Three ball in the side pocket.

975
00:43:24,158 --> 00:43:25,862
- [Mickey] What's this a ringer, Jim?

976
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:28,398
(Jim laughing)

977
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,602
- C'mon, you don't really know

978
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:32,110
another guy named Millard, do ya?

979
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,350
- Five in the side.
(balls clicking)

980
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,799
- [Millard] Jimmy, I
thought we were friends.

981
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:38,632
- [Bill] Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo!
(rain splashing)

982
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:39,845
(Jim laughing)

983
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:41,189
(coughing) Oh!

984
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:44,223
- $23 for me and $23 for you!
- That's it?

985
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:45,807
- 46 bucks, man, you were great.

986
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:46,640
(Bill laughing)

987
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,047
Some of those shots I'm gonna dream about.

988
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:50,263
- Hey, listen, about
what happened tonight?

989
00:43:50,263 --> 00:43:51,367
That meeting?

990
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,359
I'm sorry, I acted like an ass.

991
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,192
I apologize.

992
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,168
- Ah, forget it.
(hand thumping)

993
00:43:55,168 --> 00:43:56,823
"What do they call the white ball?"

994
00:43:56,823 --> 00:43:57,656
(Jim laughing)
(hand thumping)

995
00:43:57,656 --> 00:43:59,455
- I gotcha. (laughing)

996
00:43:59,455 --> 00:44:01,663
Yeah, Jimmy, I had fun tonight!

997
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,039
- Hey, you know what we oughta do?

998
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:03,872
Me and you,
(Bill coughing)

999
00:44:03,872 --> 00:44:04,951
we oughta go across country.

1000
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:05,864
I'll set 'em up,

1001
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:06,929
you run the table, huh?

1002
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:08,447
What a pair we'll be.
- Uh-huh.

1003
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:11,967
- How about Terrible
Thomas and Wiley Reilly.

1004
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:12,800
Huh?
- Ho-ho.

1005
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,262
- That's got a nice ring
to it, don't it, huh?

1006
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:15,095
- Oh, dear.

1007
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:17,126
- We'll clean up coast to coast.

1008
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:19,735
(rain splashing)

1009
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:20,568
C'mon.

1010
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,804
- Oh, hey, your dad came by tonight.

1011
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:27,013
Something about where should
he should get his brakes fixed?

1012
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:30,524
He said you'd know what
he was talking about?

1013
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:31,357
Jim?

1014
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:33,865
What is it?

1015
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:36,700
Is it a headache? (coughing)

1016
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,867
Hey, you okay?

1017
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:43,989
(Jim sobbing)
(thunder rumbling)

1018
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:46,684
You gotta find out what's causing these.

1019
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,164
- Shut up.

1020
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:49,247
Just shut up.

1021
00:44:51,044 --> 00:44:51,932
- I'm only trying to help you.

1022
00:44:51,932 --> 00:44:52,932
- Don't try!

1023
00:44:54,973 --> 00:44:57,260
This isn't my disease,

1024
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,177
it's yours!

1025
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:00,900
I didn't go out bed hopping

1026
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,400
for this fairy virus of yours.

1027
00:45:05,724 --> 00:45:07,444
I'm dying, see?

1028
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:09,860
(rain splashing)

1029
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,780
That make you feel good, sweetie?

1030
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,940
Maybe you'll get even

1031
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,940
for all those queer jokes
I told over the years.

1032
00:45:20,436 --> 00:45:23,708
(sobbing) You think
you're, you're so cool!

1033
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,620
You're so strong,

1034
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,120
a real role model for all the pretty boys.

1035
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:31,725
- Damn you.

1036
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:34,548
What, do you think this is a war

1037
00:45:34,548 --> 00:45:37,580
where you're gonna be
decorated for your wounds

1038
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,747
and I'm gonna be tried for war crimes?

1039
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:45,446
How dare you judge my pain!

1040
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,837
How dare you assume that I'm not hurting.

1041
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:52,140
When I found out,

1042
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,284
I walked out in the woods

1043
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,444
and I screamed, "Why me?"

1044
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:57,620
I scream til I lost my voice,

1045
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,537
I was weak.

1046
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:01,543
I'm no role model!

1047
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:04,383
I'm not strong, I'm terrified!

1048
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:06,050
Every morning I wake up afraid.

1049
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,487
I, I, I look into the mirror

1050
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,063
looking for some new change
in my body since yesterday.

1051
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:12,313
I'm 33, I feel like I'm 80.

1052
00:46:17,064 --> 00:46:19,981
I wanna cry for me but I don't dare

1053
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,240
because it takes lung power to cry

1054
00:46:25,703 --> 00:46:28,216
and when I see you like this, damn you,

1055
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:30,299
I even wanna cry for you,

1056
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:35,927
but I'm afraid of getting
holes in my lungs.

1057
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,920
God, it's pathetic, isn't it?

1058
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,670
Pathetic, I don't even have
the luxury of crying anymore.

1059
00:46:45,343 --> 00:46:50,343
(poignant music)
(rain splashing)

1060
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:55,652
(thunder rumbling)

1061
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:08,550
Let's go home.

1062
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:15,159
(poignant music)
(rain splashing)

1063
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:28,543
(car door thumping)

1064
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:30,135
(traffic humming)

1065
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:32,367
- [Jim] Last time I
was laid out like this,

1066
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,007
they were sewing me up.

1067
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:36,511
- Nothing so drastic today.
(equipment beeping)

1068
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:37,999
- I watched them.

1069
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:38,832
- You did, eh?

1070
00:47:38,832 --> 00:47:42,855
- Yeah, and I had an
out of body experience.

1071
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:44,247
You ever know anybody who had one?

1072
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:45,580
- Now lie still.

1073
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:48,655
- Oh, what are the odds.

1074
00:47:48,655 --> 00:47:50,607
A million pints of blood,

1075
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:53,319
save one for Old Jimmy Reilly.

1076
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:55,287
(equipment beeping)

1077
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:56,704
Beep, beep, beep.

1078
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:02,124
Staring right into my brain.

1079
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:06,742
A man's got no damn
privacy at all anymore.

1080
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:13,207
I should've stayed in the Marine Corps.

1081
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:16,957
First, I should have
joined the Marine Corps.

1082
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:24,535
Ah, me, phew.
(equipment beeping)

1083
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:27,035
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1084
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,237
hallowed be Thy name.

1085
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:36,312
(somber music)
(crow squawking)

1086
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:46,749
(pigeons cooing)

1087
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:52,987
(car humming)

1088
00:48:58,831 --> 00:49:01,831
(car door thumping)

1089
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,511
(somber music)
(traffic humming)

1090
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:08,261
(pigeons cooing)

1091
00:49:11,902 --> 00:49:14,485
(somber music)

1092
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:24,210
You never see a dead pigeon.

1093
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:27,822
- Come to think of it...

1094
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:34,662
- There must be thousands of
'em up there flying around,

1095
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:39,528
(laughing) you never see one
come falling out of the air.

1096
00:49:39,528 --> 00:49:41,528
They can't last forever,

1097
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,847
where do they go?

1098
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,645
- I like little mysteries.

1099
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:50,478
Don't you?

1100
00:49:52,499 --> 00:49:54,249
- Small brain tumors.

1101
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:58,698
That figures,

1102
00:49:58,698 --> 00:50:00,962
they always hit you where your weakest.

1103
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:02,699
- I've read that they've had some success

1104
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,914
with implant radiation.

1105
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:06,247
- Oh, forget it.

1106
00:50:08,898 --> 00:50:12,398
I'm gonna find the secrets of the pigeons.

1107
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:19,546
I kept having these dreams, you know?

1108
00:50:19,546 --> 00:50:21,946
I see these headlines,

1109
00:50:21,946 --> 00:50:24,779
"Total Reverse, Complete Recovery,

1110
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:27,410
First AIDS Survivor,

1111
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,993
Ex-Con Freed Again"

1112
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,002
and it's like walking
out of a movie theater

1113
00:50:33,002 --> 00:50:35,634
in the middle of the afternoon.

1114
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:37,301
It's all real again.

1115
00:50:38,258 --> 00:50:42,758
The popcorn, the Juju Fruit's
are stuck to your teeth,

1116
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:45,954
only there ain't no
great white horse Silver

1117
00:50:45,954 --> 00:50:48,037
to jump on and ride away.

1118
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:52,405
Just small brain tumors growing.

1119
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:00,914
You know, I never really believed

1120
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:04,178
that this was God's way of cleaning house.

1121
00:51:04,178 --> 00:51:06,345
- I never thought you did.

1122
00:51:08,178 --> 00:51:12,678
- Then there's probably
something else you know, Lisa.

1123
00:51:14,986 --> 00:51:16,298
Under other circumstances,

1124
00:51:16,298 --> 00:51:20,715
with me finally getting my
act together a little bit,

1125
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,607
sitting here like this,

1126
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:29,322
(laughing) I'd probably
be trying to find a way

1127
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:31,989
to get you to take me seriously.

1128
00:51:39,018 --> 00:51:41,601
- Mm, if it makes a difference,

1129
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:46,298
I'm honored, Mr. Reilly.

1130
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:56,258
- It makes a difference.

1131
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:07,474
They know we wanna know,
but they're not talking!

1132
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:10,141
(both laughing)

1133
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,034
- Do you think you should
take custody of the pills

1134
00:52:16,034 --> 00:52:18,538
under the circumstances?

1135
00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:22,090
- Oh, the more I take
the less good they do.

1136
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,290
- You feel pain, you call me.

1137
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,210
- [Jim] Please pick up, Lisa.
(phone ringing)

1138
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,226
- [Answering Machine]
Hi, this is Lisa Elliott,

1139
00:52:27,226 --> 00:52:28,059
you can leave a message-
- Oh, God, Lisa!

1140
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:28,892
- [Answering Machine] For me at the beep.

1141
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:29,725
- [Jim] Are you there?

1142
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:30,558
- [Answering Machine] If you're calling

1143
00:52:30,558 --> 00:52:31,391
for the AIDS walkathon,
- [Jim] Hey!

1144
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:34,679
- [Answering Machine] Please
call 555-7979, thanks.

1145
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,512
(answering machine beeping)

1146
00:52:35,512 --> 00:52:37,272
- Lisa, for God's sakes,
pick up the phone!

1147
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:38,871
Call me. (sobbing)

1148
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,191
I need a pill bad.

1149
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,119
Please call me, damn it!

1150
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,233
(receiver banging)

1151
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:48,233
- Ah, oh! (sobbing)

1152
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:52,803
I just need a pill!

1153
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,995
God! (sobbing)

1154

(television murmuring)

1181
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:17,484
- I need a pain pill, man,

1182
00:54:17,484 --> 00:54:19,828
loan me a couple, just,
just one even. (sobbing)

1183
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:21,556
- I don't have any.
(door slamming)

1184
00:54:21,556 --> 00:54:22,501
- For God's sake,
(hands slamming)

1185
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,253
everybody's got a pain pill!

1186

God. (sobbing)

1187
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,221
Hey!

00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:31,275
Hey, c'mon! (sobbing)

1189
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:33,571
- Hey you, are you drunk again?

1190
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:34,987
- Hey, man, I need a pill. (panting)

1191
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:37,172
- You're not supposed to
reside here with a habit!

1192
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:38,523
Go back!
(door slamming)

1193
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:39,627

you jerk!
(hands slamming)

1195
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:43,379
(sobbing) My head's killing me!

1196

1197
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:46,875
what's the big idea?

1198
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:47,772
Are you loaded?
(Jim sobbing)

1199
00:54:47,772 --> 00:54:49,268
- Just listen to me, please! (gasping)

1200
00:54:49,268 --> 00:54:52,060
My head's coming off, honest.
- Yeah, join the club.

1201
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,187
- Loan me a pain pill, please!

1202
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:55,331
- I don't loan pills
or hundred dollar bill!

1203
00:54:55,331 --> 00:54:56,819
- God, don't get cute,
(foot stomping)

I'm dying, c'mon!

1205

- Haven't you heard, we're all dying!

1206
00:54:59,444 --> 00:55:01,283
- Give me a pill!
(door slamming)

1207

1214

- We shouldn't have to put up with this!

1215

00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:11,641
The pain, Billy, it was killing me

1240
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:13,609
and I, I couldn't find the pills

1241
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:17,098
and Lisa wasn't home
(solemn music)

1242
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:18,931
and forgive me, Billy.

1243
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:21,713
Forgive me, I'll get it.

1244
00:57:21,713 --> 00:57:24,057
Let me get it, Billy.

1245
00:57:24,057 --> 00:57:27,673
Let me get it, Billy,-
- Hey, Jim, c'mon.

1246
00:57:27,673 --> 00:57:29,089
- I'll get it, Billy.
- It's not important.

1247
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:30,705
C'mon, it's okay.
(glass grinding)

1248
00:57:30,705 --> 00:57:32,433
Up.
- Billy.

1249
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:34,025
- Let's get up.

1250
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:36,229
- Naw, Billy, I'll get it.

1251
00:57:36,229 --> 00:57:38,697
(solemn music)
(debris crunching)

1252
00:57:38,697 --> 00:57:40,703
- It's okay.
(feet thumping)

1253
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:41,942
All right, take it easy.

1254
00:57:41,942 --> 00:57:42,775
Easy.

1255
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:47,634
(Jim sighing)

1256
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,182
- Don't believe everything
you hear, Billy.

1257
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,320
- Not a chance.

1258
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,158
(poignant music)
(light switch clicking)

1259
00:58:03,158 --> 00:58:05,825
(phone pulsing)

1260
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:09,412
(poignant music)

1261
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:23,022
(phone receiver thumping)

1262
00:58:23,022 --> 00:58:25,772
(poignant music)

1263
00:58:39,006 --> 00:58:41,470
(Bill sobbing)

1264
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,206
- This new program promises
to be very helpful,

1265
00:58:44,206 --> 00:58:46,456
I urge you all to register.

1266
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,382
I'll have new insurance forms by Friday

1267
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:50,215
and you can also pick them up

1268
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:52,286
at the clinic starting Monday.

1269
00:58:52,286 --> 00:58:55,422
Also, the University Health Service

1270
00:58:55,422 --> 00:58:58,318
will be issuing a monthly
AIDS bulletin next month

1271
00:58:58,318 --> 00:58:59,726
with the latest available treatment

1272
00:58:59,726 --> 00:59:00,822
and research data.

1273
00:59:00,822 --> 00:59:04,262
I have cards to put you
on the free mailing list.

1274
00:59:04,262 --> 00:59:05,260
Anything else?

1275
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,300
- Yeah, Lisa?

1276
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,212
What's the grace period for rent?

1277
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,148
- I know.

1278
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:11,269
Um, they sent your check
to the old address again.

1279
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:12,444
I called 'em yesterday

1280
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:14,140
and told them to get up to speed.

1281
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,135
Don't worry about it, Norma.

1282
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:16,968
- Thank you.

1283
00:59:16,968 --> 00:59:18,866
Gee, I love computers, you know?

1284
00:59:18,866 --> 00:59:21,554
- A small matter, but this
should be fair warning.

1285
00:59:21,554 --> 00:59:23,587
Unless we all start cleaning the lint

1286
00:59:23,587 --> 00:59:25,674
out of the dryer after every use,

1287
00:59:25,674 --> 00:59:28,423
we're all gonna be drying
our clothes on clothes lines-

1288
00:59:28,423 --> 00:59:29,297
- [Resident] You got that right, man.

1289
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:30,794
- For the whole world to see.

1290
00:59:30,794 --> 00:59:32,332
Won't that be interesting?

1291
00:59:32,332 --> 00:59:34,019
- Let's watch the lint, folks.

1292
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:36,067
Um, anything else?

1293
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:38,484
- Yes, I have something else.

1294
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:41,642
I think it's time that we enforce

1295
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:44,836
some of the basic rules around here.

1296
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:46,698
- Meaning what specifically, Eldon?

1297
00:59:46,698 --> 00:59:50,242
- Meaning Mr. Jim Reilly, specifically.

1298
00:59:50,242 --> 00:59:52,018
- Who doesn't happen to be here, right?

1299
00:59:52,018 --> 00:59:55,931
- Who doesn't dare happen
to be here, no doubt.

1300
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:57,354
It was made clear to all of us

1301
00:59:57,354 --> 00:59:58,892
when we moved in here

1302
00:59:58,892 --> 01:00:01,075
that the residents would not tolerate

1303
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:04,930
alcoholism, using or disruptive behavior.

1304
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:05,763
- Please.

1305
01:00:05,763 --> 01:00:06,907
- May I finish?

1306
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:08,786
- This last time did it.

1307
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:11,098
- Huh, for me and others, I might add.

1308
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:11,995
- [Stuart] Oh, yeah.

1309
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:14,045
- Now he comes banging on doors,

1310
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:16,493
yelling, cursing, demanding pills,

1311
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:19,150
acting like a drunken crazy man.

1312
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,013
- [Lisa] About the pills,

1313
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:21,781
I'm afraid that's partly my doing,

1314
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:22,614
you see-

1315
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:24,117
- [Eldon] No, we can't let you

1316
01:00:24,117 --> 01:00:26,629
take the blame for his behavior, Lisa.

1317
01:00:26,629 --> 01:00:28,381
- [Stuart] MM-mm, no way.

1318
01:00:28,381 --> 01:00:30,004
- It might help you to know

1319
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:32,285
that he's sometimes in
a great deal of pain.

1320
01:00:32,285 --> 01:00:33,902
- None of us is really blessed

1321
01:00:33,902 --> 01:00:37,061
by the bloom of good health, you know,

1322
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:40,221
and I don't think we
can let a relationship

1323
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:41,949
stand in the way of our decision

1324
01:00:41,949 --> 01:00:44,158
to do something about this.

1325
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:46,541
- (laughing) Relationship?

1326
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,541
The only relationship that
I have with Jim Reilly

1327
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,306
is as a friend.
- Mm, mm.

1328
01:00:51,306 --> 01:00:52,858
- What, what the hell is going on here?

1329
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,282
This is beautiful.

1330
01:00:54,282 --> 01:00:56,170
We are gathered in this
humanitarian shelter,

1331
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:00,035
all eager to vote to shoot a barking dog.

1332
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:01,450
I thought this place was started

1333
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,442
for people who were suffering.

1334
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:03,386
If you you're not hurting,

1335
01:01:03,386 --> 01:01:06,106
then you don't belong here, right?

1336
01:01:06,106 --> 01:01:07,186
So, what, are we gonna gather here

1337
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:09,194
and one by one throw out noise makers

1338
01:01:09,194 --> 01:01:11,277
for disturbing the peace?

1339
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:13,210
Of course it's not perfect,

1340
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,546
but if it's perfection you're looking for,

1341
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,225
you've got the wrong address.

1342
01:01:17,225 --> 01:01:19,105
You know, I, I am quite certain

1343
01:01:19,105 --> 01:01:20,729
that I'm the last person in the world

1344
01:01:20,729 --> 01:01:21,970
that Jim Reilly would think about

1345
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,089
living his final days with,

1346
01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:25,153
and yet I was the one

1347
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:27,903
that wanted to duck and run first

1348
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:31,025
and we're all going to
need more and more help

1349
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:33,275
as time goes on, all of us,

1350
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:37,849
and the next time that Jim
comes banging on your doors,

1351
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:40,041
crying out for help,

1352
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,873
why don't you think about
what you can do for him

1353
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:46,373
instead of how fast you can slam the door?

1354
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:49,465
- Compromise,
(traffic humming)

1355
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:50,873
I'll give you three pills at a time,

1356
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,465
when you're down to one, you call me

1357
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:53,937
and I'll give you three more.

1358
01:01:53,937 --> 01:01:56,129
That way you'll always have a spare.

1359
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,849
We can't have you banging
on doors begging pills.

1360
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:00,636
- I know, that was dumb.

1361
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:02,237
I should've known they'd
climb on ya for it.

1362
01:02:02,237 --> 01:02:03,868
- Oh, I'm not complaining,

1363
01:02:03,868 --> 01:02:05,021
I'm explaining.

1364
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,189
- Well anyway, thanks
for coming to my defense.

1365
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:10,590
- Oh, it wasn't me, it was Bill.

1366
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:12,020
- You're kidding me?

1367
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,836
- Why would I make up something like that?

1368
01:02:14,836 --> 01:02:16,645
- What'd he say?

1369
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:19,222
- Nevermind what he said. (laughing)

1370
01:02:19,222 --> 01:02:20,245
- C'mon, what'd he say?

1371
01:02:20,245 --> 01:02:22,173
- If you wanna know what
goes on at meetings,

1372
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,581
show up!
(hand thumping)

1373
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:24,414
(Jim laughing)

1374
01:02:24,414 --> 01:02:25,247
You know, all I can say,

1375
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:26,933
if you had Bill as a lawyer,

1376
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:29,462
I'd bet the ranch you'd
never have served time.

1377
01:02:29,462 --> 01:02:34,462
(Jim laughing)
(car horn honking)

1378
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:40,621
(door clicking)
(footsteps thudding)

1379
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,213
- Hey man, I, I, I just heard

1380
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:44,046
and I appreciate it,

1381
01:02:44,046 --> 01:02:45,317
I, I really do.

1382
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:46,150
- Forget it.

1383
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,869
- No, (laughing) I owe you one now.

1384
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:51,717
- Look, I said, forget it, all right!

1385
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:52,717
- All right.

1386
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:59,234
- Look, I'm, I'm sorry.

1387
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:07,448
(footsteps thudding)

1388
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:10,046
I'm sorry.

1389
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:14,565
Don't know why I just can't say thank you

1390
01:03:14,565 --> 01:03:16,732
or you're welcome anymore.

1391
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,605
- So where you preaching
tonight, Reverend?

1392
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:24,597
- No, these are my guest-of-honor clothes.

1393
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:26,373
Buncha friends of mine are
throwing me a birthday party

1394
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:28,540
down at the Hastings Club.

1395
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:31,291
- Hm.

1396
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,360
- Look, the, the party wasn't my idea but-

1397
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,184
- Yeah, but the last party
I'd wanna go to anyways

1398
01:03:38,184 --> 01:03:40,313
is where they count birthdays.

1399
01:03:40,313 --> 01:03:43,136
You have a good time.
(thunder rumbling)

1400
01:03:43,136 --> 01:03:44,219
- Good night.

1401
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:56,060
(door thumping)

1402
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,500
(guests murmuring)

1403
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,276
It was actually my birthday yesterday

1404
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:02,045
but we're celebrating it today.

1405
01:04:02,045 --> 01:04:03,580
- [Woman Guest] Yeah, yeah.

1406
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,546
- [Bill] It's all behind.

1407
01:04:05,546 --> 01:04:06,916
- [Woman Guest] Remember last year?

1408
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:07,852
- But thank you,

1409
01:04:07,852 --> 01:04:09,037
thank you very much.
- Nice.

1410
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:09,870
- See you later.

1411
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:10,703
- [Male Guest] Can I please have a Scotch?

1412
01:04:10,703 --> 01:04:11,536
- [Female Guest] No way-

1413
01:04:11,536 --> 01:04:13,748
- It's awful news about Millard, huh?

1414
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:15,236
- Millard?

1415
01:04:15,236 --> 01:04:17,421
Millard Evans?
(guest laughing)

1416
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:18,932
When?

1417
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:20,788
- God, Bill, I thought
you heard this morning.

1418
01:04:20,788 --> 01:04:22,596
- No, I, I, my sister told me

1419
01:04:22,596 --> 01:04:24,852
he was in Houston for radiation.

1420
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:26,084
- Here, let me take that for ya.

1421
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:29,829
- God, I've known him since kindergarten.

1422
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:31,676
- Honestly, Bill, I, I thought you knew

1423
01:04:31,676 --> 01:04:33,220
or I never would've said anything.

1424
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,220
- He's dead.

1425
01:04:38,764 --> 01:04:40,357
(sighing) I'm not feeling very well.

1426
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:42,236
- Look do you wanna take a
walk outside or something?

1427
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:44,580
I-
- No, I'm sorry, Phil,

1428
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,756
I can't handle this,

1429
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,772
will you make my apologies?

1430
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:48,668
- Oh, sure, sure-
- Thank you.

1431
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:49,501
- It's no problem.

1432
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:52,205
Look, why don't I get someone to, uh,

1433
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:54,435
to drive you home?
- Bill, are you okay?

1434
01:04:54,435 --> 01:04:55,910
- Some birthday, huh?

1435
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:56,827
Forgive me.

1450

so we brought the surprise.

(Jim and Mickey laughing)

1452
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:36,821
- [Woman Guest] Blow out the candles.

1453
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:38,685
- Told you I didn't play piano,

1454
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,877
but I hear you do.

1455
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:40,725
- Yeah.
- He sure does.

1456
01:05:40,725 --> 01:05:43,453
- Well, c'mon, get over there!
- Yeah!

1457
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:44,949

(guests applauding)

1458
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:46,501
- Yeah, c'mon!
- Play something.

1459
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:47,623
- Oh, dear.

1460
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:50,725
- So, uh, name your poison, pal.

1461
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:53,413
- You just start playing,
Millard, and I'll catch up.

1462
01:05:53,413 --> 01:05:55,229
- Okay.
- Woo!

1463
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:58,613
(saxophone swing music)

1464
01:05:58,613 --> 01:06:00,446

1469
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:25,326

(tires screeching)

1481
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:43,737
- Um, right there.

1482
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:52,006
Okay, you know,

1483
01:07:52,006 --> 01:07:55,859
we've got this taken care of.
(Bill coughing)

1484
01:07:55,859 --> 01:07:56,795
Great.

1485
01:07:56,795 --> 01:07:58,571
Good doing business with you.
- Nice to see you.

1486
01:07:58,571 --> 01:07:59,404
Bye, now.

1487
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:02,253
- Hey, what's that?

1488
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:03,086
A summons?

1489
01:08:03,086 --> 01:08:04,169
- No, a deed.

1490
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,408
- A deed?
- Mm-hm.

1491
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:08,509
A little place I've had my eye on.

1492
01:08:08,509 --> 01:08:10,972
- Why, I thought you liked it here.

1493
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:13,458
- You can't be serious!

1494
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:14,624
- Well, where is this little place

1495
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:15,800
you've had your eye on?

1496
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,089
- Oh, sorta out in the country.

1497
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:19,736
- A country place?
- Yep.

1498
01:08:19,736 --> 01:08:20,980
- You have a country place?
- Mm-hm.

1499
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,940
- This I must see.

1500
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,773
C'mon, let's-

1501
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:23,629
- (laughing) Naw, some other day.

1502
01:08:23,629 --> 01:08:25,412
- No, no, let's go and see it,

1503
01:08:25,412 --> 01:08:27,937
ah, please, my car's right here.

1504
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,760
- Okay, but don't expect me

1505
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,368
to ask you to move in with me.

1506
01:08:32,368 --> 01:08:34,568
- (sputtering) Surely you jest.

1507
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:35,704
The day you seek other quarters

1508
01:08:35,704 --> 01:08:38,081
I will immediately
become 10 years younger.

1509
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:39,520
(Jim laughing)

1510
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,660
Please.
- Why, thank you, sir.

1511
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,267
- "A country place",

1512
01:08:43,267 --> 01:08:46,659
that's the title of a
Francis Farmer movie.

1513
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:47,571
So, this is it, huh?

1514
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:50,227
- [Jim] Yeah, right
here under these trees.

1515
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:53,628
It's a little cramped but it's all mine.

1516
01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:55,731
- Ah, it's a nice neighborhood, actually.

1517
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,371
- Look at the view, huh?

1518
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:59,621
Nice trees, big lawn.
- Yep.

1519
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,163
- It's peaceful.
(crows cawing)

1520
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:04,787
Some of the funerals I've seen here.

1521
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:05,947
Nine blocks of black limos,

1522
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:07,243
you wouldn't believe it.

1523
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,527
- You sound like a regular.

1524
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:10,888
- Yeah. (Jim laughing)

1525
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:14,431
I used to come here a
lot as a kid, you know,

1526
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:16,447
whenever I needed somebody to talk to.

1527
01:09:16,447 --> 01:09:18,991
My mother, she's buried right over there.

1528
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:20,303
- You know, geologically speaking,

1529
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:24,345
this whole area was at one
point totally underwater.

1530
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:25,178
- Really?

1531
01:09:25,178 --> 01:09:26,011
- Right where you're sitting,

1532
01:09:26,011 --> 01:09:27,423
this was the bottom of the ocean.

1533
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,472
- My lot right here?

1534
01:09:28,472 --> 01:09:29,535
- Yep.

1535
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:31,631
Bottom of the ocean.

1536
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:35,631
- Man they drained it
just in time, didn't they?

1537
01:09:36,728 --> 01:09:41,728
(both laughing)
(poignant music)

1538
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:42,836
- Yeah.

1539
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:49,923
- [Lisa] May I make a suggestion?

1540
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:50,843
- [Jim] No!

1541
01:09:50,843 --> 01:09:53,439
- You can't wind up taking
pills by the bowlful, Jim,

1542
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,663
I think you should at least
consider radiation treatments!

1543
01:09:56,663 --> 01:09:58,535
- (sobbing) You first!

1544
01:09:58,535 --> 01:09:59,887
Let 'em drill holes in your head,

1545
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:01,599
tell me how it feels! (sobbing)

1546
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:03,231
- That's not quite how it works,

1547
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,631
I've been reading up on this, it's-

1548
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:07,391
- No one asked you to study my case!

1549
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:08,776
If I wanted a second opinion,

1550
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:10,343
I'd ask for it! (sobbing)

1551
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:11,583
- We're not attacking you, Jim,

1552
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:15,591
we're only trying to help you
make an informed decision!

1553
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,258
- The hell with you!

1554
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:20,390
The hell with both of you!

1555
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:22,963
(body slamming)

1556
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:24,213
And this place!

1557
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,440
Get off my back and stay off!

1558
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:33,711
(door slamming)

1559
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:34,679
(Bill coughing)

1560
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:36,727
- Any suggestions?

1561
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:37,560
- We've gotta speak to him

1562
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,975
when he's not in so much pain.

1563
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:40,308
He's irrational.

1564
01:10:41,823 --> 01:10:43,663
- Oh, my God!

1565
01:10:43,663 --> 01:10:45,151
Oh, my God, he took my car keys!

1566
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:47,151
He drives like a maniac!

1567
01:10:48,856 --> 01:10:51,343
(car door thumping)
(car rumbling)

1568
01:10:51,343 --> 01:10:52,176
- We gotta get him,

1569
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:57,076
he'll kill himself.
(tires squealing)

1570
01:10:57,076 --> 01:11:02,076
(urgent music)
(traffic humming)

1571
01:11:10,169 --> 01:11:11,747
- It's no use.

1572
01:11:11,747 --> 01:11:15,235
- Try Gates, he may have
gone over by the pool hall.

1573
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:17,818
(urgent music)

1574
01:11:20,587 --> 01:11:23,420
(tires squealing)

1575
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:28,667
(water splashing)

1576
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:29,500
Oh, God.

1577
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:31,899
- No.

1578
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:35,947
(tires squealing)
(sirens wailing)

1579
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:38,614
(ominous music)

1580
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:49,301
Don't move him.

1581
01:11:50,747 --> 01:11:55,747
(ominous music)
(water splashing)

1582
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:02,889
(monitors beeping)

1583
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:07,545
- [P.A. announcer] Paging Dr.
Charles to operating theater.

1584
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:11,792
Please report to the theater, Dr. Charles.

1585
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:12,985
- Well, he suffered a concussion,

1586
01:12:12,985 --> 01:12:16,137
which I'm sure you know
he doesn't really need.

1587
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:18,689
He needs around the clock observation

1588
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:21,522
but there's just no one available.

1589
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:23,822
- I'm available.

1590
01:12:27,273 --> 01:12:30,023
(poignant music)

1591
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,562
(blinds rattling)

1592
01:12:52,488 --> 01:12:55,238
(poignant music)

1593
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,125
(IV dripping)

1594
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:10,255
(poignant music)

1595
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:36,390
Oo, ah! (Bill groaning)

1596
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:42,502
(poignant music)

1597
01:14:13,637 --> 01:14:16,387
(poignant music)

1598
01:14:36,216 --> 01:14:38,966
(poignant music)

1599
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:26,234
- Bill?

1600
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:29,058
- Huh?

1601
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,209
- You can't keep this up.

1602
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:32,425
Go get some air.

1603
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:33,625
Go down and get a cup of coffee, maybe.

1604
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:35,321
(Bill coughing)

1605
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:36,290
- All right.

1606
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,000
- I'll sit with him.

1607
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,981
- Mm! (groaning)

1608
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:40,669
If he wakes up just call a nurse.

1609
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:41,502
- Right.

1610
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:57,697
(ambulance siren wailing)

1611
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:04,387
(Barney sighing)

1612
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:08,050
I got the brakes fixed.

1613
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:12,114
So, what else is new, right?

1614
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:18,846
Mickey tells me that you and your friend

1615
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:22,373
really burned up the
felt at the pool hall.

1616
01:16:22,373 --> 01:16:24,540
Who would've guessed, huh?

1617
01:16:26,397 --> 01:16:29,647
Life is full of surprises, sure enough.

1618
01:16:34,213 --> 01:16:35,925
You know, I was reading the other day

1619
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,927
(poignant music)

1620
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,061
that people who are unconscious,

1621
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,253
even on the operating table

1622
01:16:41,253 --> 01:16:43,920
can hear when someone's talking.

1623
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:47,336
I found that interesting.

1624
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:53,666
So, if you tell me in a week

1625
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:59,533
that you heard I got my brakes fixed,

1626
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:01,033
we'll know, right?

1627
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,659
(poignant music)

1628
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,774
Come on, Jim Boy,

1629
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:15,141
You can't go before me.

1630
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:17,391
Show a little respect, huh?

1631
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,844
Your old man needs you at his funeral.

1632
01:17:23,629 --> 01:17:25,129
See, it'd be nice,

1633
01:17:28,037 --> 01:17:30,285
a few people standing around,

1634
01:17:30,285 --> 01:17:33,368
have 'em say, "Yeah, that's his boy."

1635
01:17:39,545 --> 01:17:42,378
You gotta be there, don't you see?

1636
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,689
That's how it's supposed to work.

1637
01:17:46,689 --> 01:17:47,522
You hear?

1638
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:51,455
(poignant music)

1639
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:16,653
- Ah, how long I've been here?

1640
01:18:19,817 --> 01:18:22,900
- Oh, you've been here two days, I...

1641
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:29,420
- How about this guy,

1642
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,979
huh, Billy?

1643
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:32,646
- What'd you expect?

1644
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,669
- And where in the hell have you been?

1645
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:41,155
- Well, he-

1646
01:18:41,155 --> 01:18:42,651
- I will say this for you,

1647
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,235
you bring fresh meaning to the phrase

1648
01:18:44,235 --> 01:18:45,568
pain in the ass.

1649
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:49,290
(Jim laughing)

1650
01:18:51,284 --> 01:18:53,595
(traffic humming)
(horn honking)

1651
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:54,435
- [Lisa] Come on, Jim, I'm serious.

1652
01:18:54,435 --> 01:18:56,003
You've been in the hospital for two weeks,

1653
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,492
you're not back to normal yet.

1654
01:18:57,492 --> 01:18:59,067
The doctor said you have to take it easy

1655
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,817
for at least a month.

1656
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:04,603
- [Jim] Sorry about your car,

1657
01:19:04,603 --> 01:19:06,211
but actually I was doing you a favor.

1658
01:19:06,211 --> 01:19:08,961
- Mm, how could I ever thank you?

1659
01:19:15,328 --> 01:19:18,078
(doors thumping)

1660
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:19,976
Norma?

1661
01:19:20,855 --> 01:19:22,170
What's up, where's Bill?

1662
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:24,010
- Uh, he asked me to
drive him to the doctor,

1663
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:25,355
he wasn't up to it.

1664
01:19:25,355 --> 01:19:26,810
- The doctor?

1665
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,698
- Hey Jimmy, sorry about your bang up.

1666
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:29,578
- Thanks.

1667
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:31,106
- So, I'll go pick him up in an hour

1668
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:32,266
unless you're going that way?

1669
01:19:32,266 --> 01:19:33,362
- Oh, I'm going that way.

1670
01:19:33,362 --> 01:19:34,666
Come on, I'll get you to bed.

1671
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:35,499
- I just got outta bed,

1672
01:19:35,499 --> 01:19:36,332
let's go.

1673
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:43,730
- You can see these
small cystic areas here.

1674
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:45,474
They could mean any number
of things, of course,

1675
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:47,532
but-
- None of them cheerful.

1676
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:48,554
- (sighing) You know the book on it

1677
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:49,978
as well as I do, Bill.

1678
01:19:49,978 --> 01:19:52,586
The chills and shortness of
breath gives us no choice.

1679
01:19:52,586 --> 01:19:54,170
I've got to do a bronchoscopy

1680
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:56,370
and get some tissue from the lungs.

1681
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:57,649
- When?

1682
01:19:57,649 --> 01:20:00,178
- Well, day before yesterday
would've been preferable.

1683
01:20:00,178 --> 01:20:02,674
Hi, Lisa, come to see the picture show?

1684
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:05,290
- I never see anything in these.

1685
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:07,106
So, what's your story?

1686
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:09,522
- He's gotta do a biopsy for BCP.

1687
01:20:09,522 --> 01:20:12,272
- Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

1688
01:20:13,706 --> 01:20:18,010
Oh, yeah, it's not exactly a
vacant room up here, you know.

1689
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:20,843
(traffic humming)

1690
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:25,247
(monitors beeping)

1691
01:20:32,396 --> 01:20:33,362
- Are you family?

1692
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:34,779
- I'm his mother.

1693
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:36,770
You think I'm too young to be his mother,

1694
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:37,603
don't you?

1695
01:20:38,506 --> 01:20:39,589
- Not really.

1696
01:20:45,994 --> 01:20:47,442
- Hey, Billy.

1697
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:48,359
- Hi, Mom.

1698
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:52,501
- So, what's the good word?

1699
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,723
- Pain.

1700
01:20:56,474 --> 01:21:00,754
I feel like I have an
elephant sitting on my chest.

1701
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:03,658
- Oh, well, that's a good sign, elephants.

1702
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,386
Elephants and little people.

1703
01:21:05,386 --> 01:21:06,219
- Uh-huh.

1704
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:11,098
- I, uh, I brought the book you asked for,

1705
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:13,234
uh, "Huckleberry Finn".

1706
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:14,570
- Thanks.

1707
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,434
- Seems sorta like kid stuff
if you ask me, (laughing)

1708
01:21:17,434 --> 01:21:18,644
I mean for grown men.

1709
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:21,106
- You'll surprise yourself.

1710
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:23,330
- Me? (laughing)

1711
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:24,830
- [Bill] Go ahead.

1712
01:21:27,338 --> 01:21:29,554
- Well, all right, but remember,

1713
01:21:29,554 --> 01:21:33,290
you, uh, you asked for it. (laughing)

1714
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,714
"You don't know about me

1715
01:21:34,714 --> 01:21:36,770
without you have read a book by the name

1716
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:39,730
of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer",

1717
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:41,914
but that ain't no matter.

1718
01:21:41,914 --> 01:21:44,290
That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain

1719
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:47,506
and he told the truth, mainly.

1720
01:21:47,506 --> 01:21:49,002
There was things which he stretched

1721
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:51,578
but mainly he told the truth."

1722
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,530
Oh, well, it's gonna be fun.

1723
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,666
- [Bill] Keep, keep reading.

1724
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,058
- "That is nothing.
(poignant music)

1725
01:21:57,058 --> 01:22:00,938
I never seen anybody but
lied one time or another

1726
01:22:00,938 --> 01:22:02,698
without it was Aunt Polly

1727
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:05,474
or the Widow or maybe Mary.

1728
01:22:05,474 --> 01:22:08,538
Aunt Polly, Tom's Aunt Polly she is,

1729
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:10,490
and Mary and the Widow Douglas

1730
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,991
is all told about in that book,

1731
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:16,703
which is mostly a true book, I suspect."

1732
01:22:16,703 --> 01:22:18,055
- Keep, keep reading.

1733
01:22:18,055 --> 01:22:21,064
- "Now, the way that the
book winds up is this:

1734
01:22:21,064 --> 01:22:22,464
Tom and me found the money

1735
01:22:22,464 --> 01:22:24,295
that the robbers hid in the cave

1736
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:26,511
and it made us rich."

1737
01:22:26,511 --> 01:22:31,511
(pump hissing)
(Bill coughing)

1738
01:22:38,672 --> 01:22:43,672
(monitors beeping)
(Bill coughing)

1739
01:22:54,126 --> 01:22:59,028
(Bill choking)
(Bill gasping)

1740
01:22:59,028 --> 01:23:02,737
(monitors beeping)

1741
01:23:02,737 --> 01:23:07,737
(Bill coughing)
(Bill gasping)

1742
01:23:08,036 --> 01:23:09,923
- The air leak in the lung is not healing.

1743
01:23:09,923 --> 01:23:12,347
It will have to be closed surgically.

1744
01:23:12,347 --> 01:23:15,387
Also, the liver was sending
out some abnormal readings.

1745
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:16,915
We took an ultrasound scan

1746
01:23:16,915 --> 01:23:19,556
and it shows tuberculosis of the liver.

1747
01:23:19,556 --> 01:23:21,763
We have to do this without delay.

1748
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,204
Bill has already given his consent.

1749
01:23:24,204 --> 01:23:25,493
- But now?

1750
01:23:25,493 --> 01:23:27,027
- Well, I'd like to do it at 6:00 AM,

1751
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:29,531
I can get the O.R. and
the nurses I prefer then.

1752
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:31,448
Dr. Morgan will assist.

1753
01:23:32,612 --> 01:23:34,291
- Well, he's been an early riser

1754
01:23:34,291 --> 01:23:36,458
as long as I've known him.

1755
01:23:41,163 --> 01:23:44,580
(gurney wheels clacking)

1756
01:23:52,188 --> 01:23:54,021
- You'll be just fine.

1757
01:23:55,851 --> 01:23:58,075
- Anything happens, (gasping)

1758
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,908
you take the books and the towels.

1759
01:24:02,836 --> 01:24:05,115
- Boy, have you turned into a con artist.

1760
01:24:05,115 --> 01:24:05,948
You're just testing me

1761
01:24:05,948 --> 01:24:08,811
to see if I'm gonna leave
you my cue stick and TV.

1762
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:11,323
We'll settle our estates
when you get home.

1763
01:24:11,323 --> 01:24:12,156
- Home.

1764
01:24:13,404 --> 01:24:15,237
- Give em hell, Billy.

1765
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:20,884
(gurney wheels clacking)

1766
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:30,987
- I'm going to wait with Bill's parents.

1767
01:24:30,987 --> 01:24:33,515
- God, I hate these places.

1768
01:24:33,515 --> 01:24:35,432
I'm gonna get some air.

1769
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:43,289
(poignant music)

1770
01:24:46,275 --> 01:24:49,192
(thunder rumbling)

1771
01:24:51,356 --> 01:24:54,023
(siren wailing)

1772
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:58,609
(poignant music)

1773
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:02,545
(pigeons cooing)

1774
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:10,290
(poignant music)

1775
01:25:33,524 --> 01:25:36,191
(door thumping)

1776
01:25:50,832 --> 01:25:55,832
(poignant music)
(footsteps thumping)

1777
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,547
(doorbell buzzing)

1778
01:26:22,454 --> 01:26:25,537
(footsteps thudding)

1779
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:39,100
(poignant music)

1780
01:26:45,414 --> 01:26:47,603
(door thumping)

1781
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:48,436
(Lisa sighing)

1782
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:50,088
- I should've stayed at the hospital.

1783
01:26:50,088 --> 01:26:53,005
- No, he wouldn't have expected it.

1784
01:26:56,457 --> 01:26:58,784
- Dad said that he,

1785
01:26:58,784 --> 01:27:00,633
he sat by my bed for two days and nights

1786
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,056
when I was out of it. (laughing)

1787
01:27:02,056 --> 01:27:02,889
- Yes.

1788
01:27:08,105 --> 01:27:08,938
- His mother wants to know

1789
01:27:08,938 --> 01:27:12,188
if you'll say something at the service.

1790
01:27:15,769 --> 01:27:18,289
(poignant music)

1791
01:27:18,289 --> 01:27:20,706
(Jim crying)

1792
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:24,848
(birds singing)

1793
01:27:24,848 --> 01:27:28,489
- I'm proud that I was asked
to say something here today,

1794
01:27:28,489 --> 01:27:30,906
it feels good to get it said.

1795
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:35,422
Me and Bill, we only knew each other

1796
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:36,916
lately in our lives.

1797
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:40,068
Actually, we knew very
little about each other,

1798
01:27:40,068 --> 01:27:44,485
but it seems we understood
what needed understanding.

1799
01:27:45,429 --> 01:27:47,512
I wasn't like him at all,

1800
01:27:48,508 --> 01:27:50,591
but I, I liked him a lot.

1801
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:55,291
I think we were friends

1802
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,867
but, you know,

1803
01:27:56,867 --> 01:27:59,284
if we hadn't both been dying,

1804
01:28:00,163 --> 01:28:02,211
I don't think we would've
taken the trouble

1805
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:04,388
to become friends at all.

1806
01:28:04,388 --> 01:28:07,531
Maybe that says something about the world.

1807
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:10,448
I'm not grateful for my affliction,

1808
01:28:13,275 --> 01:28:14,731
But honest to God,

1809
01:28:14,731 --> 01:28:17,314
I feel that I'm a better person

1810
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:21,147
because my illness led me

1811
01:28:21,147 --> 01:28:25,875
to meet this man we're
saying goodbye to today.

1812
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:29,100
Not too long ago Bill told me

1813
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,083
that this whole place here

1814
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:34,583
was at the bottom of the ocean

1815
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:38,211
and it reminded me of one

1816
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:40,939
of his favorite pieces from a book

1817
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:45,356
and I thought he might like
to hear it one last time.

1818
01:28:47,507 --> 01:28:52,007
"With the landless gull that
at sunset folds her wings

1819
01:28:53,491 --> 01:28:56,435
and is rocked to sleep between billows,

1820
01:28:56,435 --> 01:28:59,185
so, at nightfall the Nantucketer,

1821
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,998
out of sight of land,

1822
01:29:01,998 --> 01:29:05,331
furls his sails and lays him to his rest

1823
01:29:06,256 --> 01:29:08,463
while under his very pillow

1824
01:29:08,463 --> 01:29:11,380
rush herds of walruses and whales."

1825
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,820
Sleep well, Billy,

1826
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,736
it's growing dark for all of us.

1827
01:29:19,736 --> 01:29:22,486
(poignant music)

1828
01:29:57,552 --> 01:30:00,455
- Um, I hope you folks don't mind,

1829
01:30:00,455 --> 01:30:02,271
I'm Jim's father.

1830
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:06,352
I, uh, I used to work for
a sailmaker years back

1831
01:30:06,352 --> 01:30:08,888
and I remembered a few stitches.

1832
01:30:08,888 --> 01:30:13,087
I, I sewed one of those big
quilt pieces for your son.

1833
01:30:13,087 --> 01:30:17,088
You know, one of those,
the big, big AIDS quilt.

1834
01:30:17,088 --> 01:30:20,921
It just says, "Bill T,
he cared and so do we."

1835
01:30:26,312 --> 01:30:28,231
Here.
(distant church bell tolling)

1836
01:30:28,231 --> 01:30:30,399
- Thank you so much.

1837
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:32,899
- Your son was quite a laddie.

1838
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:35,902
- Yes, he was.

1839
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:40,515
Thank you. (sobbing)

1840
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:47,333
(church bells tolling)
(crows cawing)

1841
01:30:59,135 --> 01:30:59,968
(TV tennis crowd murmuring)

1842
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:04,968
- [Tennis Commentator] 15/love,
James is the 17th seed.

1843
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:08,008
And the serve.

1844
01:31:10,037 --> 01:31:11,584
(door knocking)
(door bell buzzing)

1845
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,584
- Yeah, Lisa, it's open!

1846
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:17,356
- Jim Reilly, this is David Morgan.

1847
01:31:21,496 --> 01:31:23,231
- Davey, how is it going?

1848
01:31:23,231 --> 01:31:26,335
- Look, I know all about seniority.

1849
01:31:26,335 --> 01:31:29,343
See, all my life, wherever I've gone,

1850
01:31:29,343 --> 01:31:30,887
always been the newcomer.

1851
01:31:30,887 --> 01:31:33,815
I'm not really impressed with rank, okay?

1852
01:31:33,815 --> 01:31:36,471
So, let's get one thing straight

1853
01:31:36,471 --> 01:31:38,215
right from the start.

1854
01:31:38,215 --> 01:31:40,199
I'm gonna make it, you hear?

1855
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:41,671
I'm not gonna lie down and give up

1856
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:42,504
and I don't wanna hear

1857
01:31:42,504 --> 01:31:45,287
any doom and gloom
speeches from old timers.

1858
01:31:45,287 --> 01:31:46,648
I'm gonna beat this thing

1859
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:48,487
and I don't wanna hear otherwise.

1860
01:31:48,487 --> 01:31:50,070
Is that acceptable?

1861
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:59,319
- You walked in the right door, Davey Boy,

1862
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:02,679
you're looking at your biggest
fan and strongest rooter.

1863
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:03,991
I hope you live next to forever

1864
01:32:03,991 --> 01:32:06,839
and that I'm still around to cheer you on.

1865
01:32:06,839 --> 01:32:08,015
You like tennis?

1866
01:32:08,015 --> 01:32:11,199
- Yeah, all but women's doubles.

1867
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,047
- What's wrong with women's doubles?

1868
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:15,224
Well, we'll talk about it.
(hopeful music)

1869
01:32:15,224 --> 01:32:17,640
- So, uh, how come you
get the front bedroom

1870
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,095
where all the action is?

1871
01:32:19,095 --> 01:32:20,392
- [Jim] You wouldn't
like it in there, Davey,

1872
01:32:20,392 --> 01:32:22,807
it's noisy, cramped-

1873
01:32:22,807 --> 01:32:26,023
- {David] Which means the other
one's dark and stuffy, huh?

1874
01:32:26,023 --> 01:32:28,255
- [Jim] Trust me, Davey.

1875
01:32:28,255 --> 01:32:30,175
- [Lisa] Why don't you two flip

1876
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:32,327
to see who gets the front bedroom?

1877
01:32:32,327 --> 01:32:34,880
- [David] Yeah, any objections?

1878
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,223
- [Jim] You gotta coin, Davey Boy?

1879
01:32:38,223 --> 01:32:41,056
(uplifting music)

1880
01:32:51,594 --> 01:32:55,177
(peaceful classical music)
