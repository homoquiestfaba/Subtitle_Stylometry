181
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,188
I need you to cover it.

182
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:47,075
- But don't we have a social
page reporter or something?

183
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:49,448
- [chuckles] You know we
cover everything around here.

184
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:50,727
This isn't New York.

185
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:52,368
- You're right about that.

186
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:56,178
- Kyle, we newspaper men
are lucky to be employed.

187
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:57,288
The world is changing.

188
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,727
People want their news
now, not tomorrow morning.

189
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:00,607
- Yeah, you're right.

190
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:04,509
But I still say nothing
compares to holding a newspaper.

191
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,918
- I agree with you,

192
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:09,038
but you and I are dinosaurs
facing extinction.

193
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:13,288
- Well, I'm not dead yet and
good stories can change that.

194
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:15,361
- By the way,

195
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,018
great piece on the house
burning down last week.

196
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:18,998
- Well, thanks.

197
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,928
Hey, since it was so good,

198
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,717
why don't I do a followup
on the fire fights?

199
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:24,978
- That's a great idea.

200
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:25,811
- [Kyle] I'll get started--

201
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:27,727
- Just as soon as you
cover the fundraiser.

202
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:30,528
By the way,

203
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,338
my ex is hosting.

204
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:35,728
- Okay.

205
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:37,148
How do you guys get along?

206
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:40,238
Will I be thrown out for
mentioning the paper?

207
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:43,345
- She's my ex for a reason.

208
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:46,168
But actually we're civil.

209
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:47,358
We run in the same circles.

210
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:50,748
She comes from old money, I
run the only town newspaper.

211
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:55,028
- Are you sure Susan
can't handle the story?

212
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:56,928
- Susan's covering another story.

213
00:10:56,995 --> 00:11:00,468
Besides, I like the thought of
you covering a social event.

214
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,707
It makes me smile.

215
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:03,547
- You're killing me.

216
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:04,498
- Have fun, Kyle.

217
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:15,443
[soft classical music]
[guests chattering]

218
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,493
- Well, actually education

219
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,294
is one of the very important
parts of my platform.

220
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,564
You know, if there is
anything at all that you need.

221
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:25,048
- I don't know about my husband.

222
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,018
- Well, we'll worry about
that a little bit later.

223
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:28,851
Oh, excuse me.

224
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:29,898
- Mr. Mayor.

225
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:30,798
- Excuse me.

226
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,888
- Kyle Deeders, Clarksburg Gazette.

227
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:35,878
Can I get a statement about the gala?

228
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,778
- Of course.

229
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,958
This fundraiser is of huge importance

230
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:41,408
for improving the quality of life

231
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,068
of every citizen of Clarksburg.

232
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,690
This plan will impact all of
our citizens in a great way.

233
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,668
I want to thank the lady behind the gala.

234
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:50,818
The lady who opened up
her beautiful home to us,

235
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,088
Mrs. Carrie Andrews.

236
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:53,283
- Hello, nice to meet you.

237
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,138
- Nice to meet you.

238
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,148
Thank you, Mayor.

239
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,798
May I take a few photos?

240
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:00,214
- Absolutely, just make
sure you get my good side.

241
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,114
- Right.

242
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,017
You got it.

243
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:07,477
[soft classical music]
[camera shutter clicking]

244
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:08,553
Thank you.

245
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,698
Mrs. Andrews, Clarksburg Gazette.

246
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,557
You have a lovely house here.

247
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:14,158
- Why thank you.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,228
- I feel this fundraiser

249
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:17,527
is going to help everyone
in the community,

250
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:19,728
from the homeless to the upper crust.

251
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,148
People have been so generous.

252
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,178
In fact, we just received
our largest contribution yet.

253
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,408
- Oh really?
- Yes.

254
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,940
Come with me and I'll introduce
you to the benefactor.

255
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:31,257
[soft classical music]

256
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,251
[guests chattering]

257
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,055
- I think that your
mission is very important.

258
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,527
- Why thank you so much.

259
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,298
I appreciate you very much.

260
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:40,265
- Father Michaels.

261
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:44,198
This is a reporter from our local paper.

262
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,688
I was just telling him about
your generous contribution.

263
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:48,778
- Hmm, nice meeting you, Mister...

264
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:49,611
- Deeders, Kyle Deeders.

265
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:50,888
- Mr. Deeders.

266
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:51,721
- Nice to meet you.

267
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,628
Can I get your full name for the paper?

268
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:57,108
- Of course, Father
Sebastian Roderick Michaels.

269
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,908
- Which church are you assigned to?

270
00:12:58,975 --> 00:12:59,928
- None at the moment.

271
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,298
I just recently moved here.

272
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,328
- Well, Mrs. Andrews said you

273
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:04,253
made the biggest
contribution to the cause.

274
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,776
- Did I?

275
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:07,268
- Indeed you did.

276
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:09,288
- Can I get a picture of the both of you?

277
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,738
- I'm afraid not.

278
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,268
- Oh, come on.

279
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:13,487
It's just one picture.

280
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:14,321
- No.

281
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:16,457
- Everybody loves to see the
generous people in the paper.

282
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:17,467
- I said no.

283
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:19,467
- Okay.

284
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,507
- I'm terribly sorry if we've
offended you, Father Michaels.

285
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:25,848
- It is I who am sorry.

286
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,108
In the past, I was a missionary in Africa.

287
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,288
Most people there believed

288
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:31,638
that photographs steal
a part of your soul.

289
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:35,007
I'm afraid the superstition
rubbed off on me. [chuckles]

290
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:38,457
- Father, you sound like
a very interesting man.

291
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:40,808
I was wondering if I could interview you

292
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,572
sometime for the paper.

293
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,377
- Hmm, as long as there
are no photographs.

294
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,768
- No, no photos.

295
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:48,928
- That'll be fine then.

296
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,768
Ms. Andrews has my contact information.

297
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:52,547
- Great, I'll be in touch.

298
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,248
Well, I better get back
to earning my keep.

299
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:58,571
Mrs. Andrews, thank you for allowing me

300
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,533
into your beautiful home.
- You're welcome.

301
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,467
Good evening.

302
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:02,621
- Good to meet you, Father.

303
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:03,888
- Likewise.

304
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,268
- I'm surprised they let you in there.

305
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:12,101
- Funny.

306
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:16,698
You know, Barry, I must say I
prefer the atmosphere in here,

307
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,238
even though Jack is here.

308
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:19,905
- That's why I keep coming back.

309
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,268
- Deeders, I've got more
class than you'll ever have.

310
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:28,498
- Jack, you've got plenty of class.

311
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,298
It's just all low. [chuckles]

312
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:31,198
- Asshole.

313
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:36,168
- You know, I've been in here a few times,

314
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:39,447
and you always seem to be
running your mouth with this guy.

315
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,238
- Mister, what's your problem?

316
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,307
- My problem is I don't like loudmouths

317
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:46,228
who think they're better
then everybody else.

318
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,397
- Than.

319
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:48,658
- What?

320
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:50,958
- It's better than everybody else.

321
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:54,457
Not then, T-H-A-N.

322
00:14:55,345 --> 00:15:00,100
[fist bashing]
[Kyle groaning]

323
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,948
- How do you like that,
you egotistical prick?

324
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:04,268
- Honestly?

325
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,543
Jack, you can hit harder than this.

326
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,658
[fist bashing]
[Kyle groaning]

327
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:08,558
Ow!

328
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,048
[attacker groaning]

329
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:17,838
- Hi, I'm Detective Smith, Clarksburg PD.

330
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:18,958
Kyle, are you okay?

331
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:22,417
- Yeah, I'm okay.

332
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:25,688
- You wanna press charges
against this son of a bitch?

333
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:28,347
- Nah, just get him outta here.

334
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:29,610
- You heard the man.

335
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,678
[attacker grunting]

336
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:34,018
Find somewhere else to drink.

337
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:37,252
[rhythmic rock music]

338
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:45,574
[Kyle groaning]

339
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:50,038
- Well, that was fun.

340
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:53,968
Well boys, I got a deadline to meet.

341
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:56,258
Jonesy.

342
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,352
Thank you.

343
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:02,771
Night all.

344
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:17,958
[dramatic music]
[Kyle shouting]

345
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:20,578
Oh, how's it goin' tonight, Jimmy?

346
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,367
- I might have somethin'
for you to look into.

347
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,217
Hey, what happened to you?

348
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,678
- Ah, don't worry about it.

349
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:27,948
What have you got?

350
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,648
- The homeless in town, they're missing.

351
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,528
- Jimmy, you're one of
them, and you're right here.

352
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:33,478
- No, the others.

353
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,207
Over half of them are gone.

354
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,589
- Gone, gone where?

355
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:37,422
- I don't know.

356
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,187
They keep disappearing over
the past couple nights.

357
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:41,738
The rest of us are worried.

358
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,078
- Maybe they left town.

359
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:46,187
- No, some of them were friends of mine.

360
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:47,598
Something's wrong, I tell you.

361
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:48,828
Something's happenin'.

362
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,638
- Okay, okay, okay.

363
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:51,608
How many are missing?

364
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:52,708
- 30 or 40.

365
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:53,858
- 30 or 40?

366
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,167
And nobody's noticed that they're gone?

367
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:57,098
- How?

368
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:58,668
Nobody cares.

369
00:16:58,735 --> 00:16:59,818
We're invisible.

370
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,207
- Okay, I'll look into it.

371
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:03,478
See what I can dig up.

372
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:04,348
- Thanks, Kyle.

373
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:05,408
- You stay safe.

374
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:07,618
- Will do, I've been hidin' at night.

375
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:08,451
- Good.

376
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,008
Oh, here you go.

377
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:12,167
- Thanks, Kyle.

378
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,767
- I'll let you know when I find 'em.

379
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,417
[tense music]

380
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:38,778
[box thudding]

381
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:40,287
How's it goin'?

382
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:43,598
- Good, until you showed up, Deeders.

383
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:47,227
- Brady, saying such things,
and I bring you gifts.

384
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:48,348
Six of 'em.

385
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,428
Well, five.

386
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:51,207
I was hungry on the way over.

387
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,146
- What do you want?

388
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:57,131
- [sighs] I hear there's
a bunch of homeless

389
00:17:57,198 --> 00:18:00,278
around Clarksburg that have gone missing.

390
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,110
- Where'd you hear that?

391
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,998
- I have my sources.

392
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:04,988
- Well.

393
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:08,828
Your sources are right.

394
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,088
- Well, what is the police's take on it?

395
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:15,562
- You have to talk to
Captain Hayes about that.

396
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:17,938
- Off the record.

397
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,578
- They've moved on.

398
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:24,638
- Oh, come on, 40 people just moved on?

399
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,708
- Look, they're homeless.

400
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,758
Does anybody really give a
shit if there's less of them?

401
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,118
- They are also people, Brady.

402
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,488
- The matter is under investigation.

403
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:37,768
We do our jobs, Deeders.

404
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:39,287
- I never said you didn't.

405
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,530
[sighs] Anything else you can give me.

406
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,588
- We don't have anything else.

407
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:46,698
- Okay, thanks.

408
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:50,068
Oh, you've got some stuff on your shirt.

409
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,157
- Asshole.

410
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,849
[man whistles]

411
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:06,071
[coffee splashing]

412
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,687
[playful music]

413
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:20,215
[spoon clanging]

414
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:25,998
- No, no, do it.

415
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:26,863
No, you don't.

416
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,763
No, no.

417
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,831
- [Together] George, I gotta scoop.

418
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:32,558
- [sighs] Okay.

419
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,224
- It's a bombshell, I'm serious.

420
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:37,435
- There's something goin'
on with the homeless

421
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:38,268
people in town.

422
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:39,100
They're going missing.

423
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,007
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies first.

424
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:42,378
- But! [groans]

425
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,388
- I just got off the phone.

426
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:44,878
The homeless in town are vanishing.

427
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:45,748
- That's my story.

428
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,518
I've been working on it since last night!

429
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:48,518
- Back off, Deeders.

430
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:49,438
This one is mine.

431
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:52,418
You've pushed me outta stories
before, but not this time.

432
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,147
- Easy, easy.

433
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,568
This sounds like a big story.

434
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:56,949
I want you two to work on it together.

435
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:57,782
- No.
- No fucking way.

436
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:59,507
- No, I can't work with him.

437
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,773
He's just gonna try to take
all the credit for my story.

438
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,077
- [George] I want you to
take the personal angle.

439
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,758
Learn more about the missing persons.

440
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,808
Kyle, I want you to do police procedure.

441
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,221
- I can do police procedures too.

442
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,178
- Kyle does it better.

443
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,558
Just like you're better than Kyle at

444
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,934
making the reader feel the story.

445
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:15,827
- Hey!

446
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:17,288
- Enough, children.

447
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,187
Get the story.

448
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:30,491
[George exhales]

449
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,057
[tense music]

450
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:46,213
[camera shutter clicking]

451
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:59,017
- Hey, please don't run.

452
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,288
Please, I just want to talk to you.

453
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,518
Just talk, I swear.

454
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:09,668
Look, how would you
like to have a $20 bill

455
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,997
for just talking to me?

456
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,138
What's your name?

457
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:17,037
- Ronnie.

458
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:18,878
- Ronnie.

459
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,037
Do you live here?

460
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,168
- Not any more.

461
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:22,324
- Why not?

462
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:23,224
- 'Cause.

463
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,415
- Did something happen here?

464
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,558
Did you see it?

465
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:42,545
I know this is rough, but can
you tell me what happened?

466
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:44,528
- I was sleeping.

467
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:47,097
I used to sleep over there.

468
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:51,388
I heard Billy and them yelling,
but I stayed covered up.

469
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,888
They started fighting and screaming.

470
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:59,542
Screaming just went on and on.

471
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,408
I was too afraid to move.

472
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,728
Then it got real quiet,

473
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:11,063
but I could still hear
people moving around.

474
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,418
I finally peeked out,
and I saw them leaving.

475
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:16,495
- What did you see?

476
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:20,927
- I saw women in dresses
and a man in robes.

477
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:24,498
- Robes.

478
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:25,528
Like bath robes?

479
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:29,518
- No, like they wear at St. Vincent.

480
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:31,278
- [Kyle] Like a priest.

481
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:33,638
- Yeah, I guess so.

482
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:35,577
- Do you remember anything else?

483
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:36,477
- No.

484
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,348
Stayed they're real quiet all night.

485
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:41,618
Got outta there at sunup.

486
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:44,028
Ran as fast as I could to the food line.

487
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:45,118
- Did you tell anybody?

488
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,268
- A few of my friends.

489
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:48,947
Nobody really believed me.

490
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:50,887
They do now.

491
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,505
- Why is that?

492
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,418
- A lot more are gone now.

493
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:56,658
They get them at night.

494
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:00,328
I sleep at the shelter.

495
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,065
- At St. Vincent.

496
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:07,728
Thanks, kid.

497
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:08,628
You did good.

498
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,035
- Thanks, Mister.

499
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:17,486
[somber rock music]

500
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:27,047
[cameras shutter clicking]

501
00:23:28,435 --> 00:23:29,777
- Look at this guy.

502
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:32,428
Rummaging through our crime
scene like it's a yard sale.

503
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,738
- Kyle, don't you have any
respect for the job we try to do?

504
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:36,708
- Crime scene?

505
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:37,850
Oh, I'm sorry.

506
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,884
I must have missed the
police tape you guys put up.

507
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:45,158
And you two are some of
the few I do have respect

508
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,294
for in your department.

509
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,548
- Just 'cause we give you exclusives,

510
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:52,154
and I yank drunk guys
off your ass in bars.

511
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,278
- Larry. [laughs]

512
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,887
That's not, well that
is kind of true, yeah.

513
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,658
But I still respect you guys.

514
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,608
- So did you find anything?

515
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,028
- You mean I'm really
here before any cops?

516
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:06,604
- We just got hint of
the case this morning.

517
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:08,978
- Apparently the other guys were busy,

518
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:10,438
so we got stuck with it.

519
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,148
- But these people have been missing

520
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,479
for the past couple of days.

521
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:15,941
Are you saying that no
one's been down here?

522
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:18,178
- That's not what we're saying.

523
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:20,088
- Other detectives have been here.

524
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:21,128
- They find anything?

525
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:23,248
- No, which is why we're here now.

526
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,567
- I'm thinking some guy
pulls up in a truck,

527
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,520
offers them food and stuff.

528
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:32,695
If they get in, he hauls 'em off.

529
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,608
- Wrong.

530
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:37,488
- It's as good a reason as anybody's.

531
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:41,298
- How about they were
attacked and carried off

532
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:45,034
by a group of women and
some guy in priest robes?

533
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:46,978
- That's pretty specific, Kyle.

534
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:49,678
- Because, Dom, that's
exactly what happened.

535
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:51,278
- [Larry] And how do you know this?

536
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:52,817
- An eyewitness.

537
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:54,458
- A sober eyewitness?

538
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,438
- Yes, she was sober.

539
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:58,398
- And do you believe her story?

540
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,311
- She says she was here.

541
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:02,908
And quite frankly, it's as good a theory

542
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:04,378
as some guy in a truck.

543
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:06,188
- Fair enough.

544
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,418
- Hey!

545
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,978
- So where is this witness?

546
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:10,918
- Kid's name is Ronnie.

547
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:14,341
You'll find her probably at St. Vincent's.

548
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:16,348
- We'll check out her story.

549
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:21,025
- So what's the switch up with
the detectives on this case?

550
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:22,737
- [Larry] Off the record?

551
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:24,128
- Sure.

552
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:26,278
- Nobody wants the case.

553
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:29,108
People don't care if the
homeless aren't around anymore.

554
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:30,618
- We were told to do the bare minimum

555
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:33,028
just so we could say it was
thoroughly investigated.

556
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,358
- Are you serious?

557
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:36,268
- That comes from higher
ups in the department.

558
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,288
- But the homeless are still people.

559
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:40,958
- I know that, and we're
gonna do the best job we can

560
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:41,790
to help find these people.

561
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,558
- Well, how did you get
stuck with this job?

562
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,398
- We're in the dog house.

563
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,141
Well, Larry is.

564
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,638
- What did you do?

565
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:55,948
- The rumor is, and I stress rumor,

566
00:25:57,675 --> 00:26:00,325
that I slept with the
captain's 19-year-old daughter.

567
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:03,208
- And did you?

568
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:06,837
- Without evidence, it's just a rumor.

569
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,208
- Captain can't do anything without proof,

570
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:13,548
but he can give us every shit
detail nobody else wants.

571
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,068
- Maybe if you crack this case,

572
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,122
it'll get you back in his good graces.

573
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:19,373
- [Dom] You're a funny guy.

574
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,607
- I hope it was worth it.

575
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:22,631
- It was.

576
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:24,548
[cops chuckle]

577
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:25,647
- I'll keep in touch.

578
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:26,548
- Thanks, Kyle.

579
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:33,421
- Damn, I knew I came in too late.

580
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:35,045
- Come here.

581
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:37,218
I didn't expect to see you here today.

582
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,925
- Oh, I knew you were going in early,

583
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,737
but I just wanted to come by and see

584
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:42,138
that beautiful face for a minute.

585
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:43,923
- Aw, that's so sweet.

586
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,756
Thank you.

587
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:46,758
- It's the truth.
[lips smacking]

588
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:47,697
- But I've gotta hurry.

589
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:48,531
I'm running late.

590
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,338
- I know, I just wanted
to come by and say hi.

591
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,028
- [Rachel] How's your story coming?

592
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,298
- Oh, it's got its twists.

593
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,764
I think it could be the one.

594
00:26:57,905 --> 00:26:59,298
Have there been any homeless people

595
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,645
coming into the ER lately?

596
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,667
- Not that I've heard, no.

597
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,878
- [Kyle] So nothing strange?

598
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:08,445
- Just the medical supply
building got broke into.

599
00:27:09,315 --> 00:27:11,098
- Yeah, what was taken?

600
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:14,577
- Nothing that I know of,
I just thought it was odd.

601
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:17,758
- Hmm, sounds like
something to check into.

602
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:18,677
- I've got to go.

603
00:27:18,744 --> 00:27:19,895
I am running very late.

604
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:22,920
[lips smacking]

605
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:23,918
But I am late.

606
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:24,751
I love you.

607
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:26,577
I gotta go.
- Okay, go, go.

608
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,707
- I'll call you later.

609
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:29,258
- All right, bye.

610
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:39,557
- Abducted by a group of women and a man

611
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,928
wearing priest robes.

612
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:42,637
- That's what the witness said.

613
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,544
- Did the cops corroborate any of this?

614
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:46,938
- No, they're doing bare bones on it.

615
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,868
They think no one cares.

616
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,868
- I'm not running this part of the story.

617
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,640
- Come on.
- Kyle, I like the rest of it.

618
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:55,058
I don't even mind the digs at the cops.

619
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,838
Although you may want
to tread lightly there.

620
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:59,318
Getting on the bad side of
the police can get dicey.

621
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,369
- I've been there more
times than I care to count.

622
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:03,018
- I bet you have.

623
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:05,176
Didn't you get run outta Vegas one time?

624
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:06,488
- [sighs] That wasn't me.

625
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:08,218
I've never been to Vegas.

626
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:13,285
- Oh, regardless, the police
aren't gonna be happy.

627
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:16,548
- Well, I wouldn't write
it if they did their jobs.

628
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,898
- Why are you so concerned
about these people?

629
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,400
- 'Cause they are people.

630
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,848
- [chuckles] I think you smell your ticket

631
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:27,778
back to New York if you can
break this as a big story.

632
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:31,557
- There isn't anything
wrong with that, is there?

633
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:32,391
- No.

634
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:35,337
- But think of this, when
the homeless are all gone,

635
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,984
more people will start to vanish.

636
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,088
People that will be missed.

637
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,458
This isn't going away.

638
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:42,438
- How do you know?

639
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:47,338
- I've got a sense when a
story is bigger than it seems.

640
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:50,068
- Well, for the sake of
the people in this town,

641
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,708
I hope you're wrong.

642

[soft instrumental music]

643
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:02,882
- Checkmate.

644
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,938
- Oh, excuse you.

645
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:05,771
- Sorry, Deeders.

646
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:06,658
Working on a big story.

647
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:07,918
- Yeah, I know.

648
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:09,638
My story that you horned in on.

649
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:11,359
- You pushed your way into my story.

650
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:13,058
- Facts like yours, your story will

651
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,408
never see the life of day.

652
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:17,148
- Listen here, Deeders.

653
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,527
I don't like you, I never have.

654
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:20,751
I can out-write you every day of the week.

655
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:23,517
And I'm gonna use this story
to prove it to everybody!

656
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:27,288
- Did you have Italian for lunch?

657
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:29,604
I'm smelling garlic, maybe some fish.

658
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,557
- Really?

659
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:31,882

[car horn honks]

664
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:51,818
- So what did the thieves take?

665
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:52,981
- It was weird what they took.

666
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:54,988
- What do you mean?

667
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:58,128
- Well, they took IVs,
plasma and rubber tubing.

668
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:59,361
- How's that strange?

669
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:01,915
- Well, we've been broken into a lot.

670
00:30:01,982 --> 00:30:05,811
They always take needles
and such for drug use.

671
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:08,598
This time, they took a few needles.

672
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,018
But why the plasma?

673
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:13,208
- You had video surveillance, right?

674
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:14,434
Did you look at it?

675
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,938
- No, no video at all.

676
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:16,771
- Why is that?

677
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:17,671
- Look.

678
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:24,412

683
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,467
I'm telling you, those security cameras

684
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:59,788
are 12 to 15 feet in the air,

685
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:02,454
and they look like they've
been grabbed and crushed.

686
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,298
- I think you've had one too many.

687

And, uh.

And where's that guy that
punched you in the mouth

when we need him?

Your talents are being wasted.

692
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:17,578
- How did they crush them?

- Who cares?

I've got this feeling that it's somehow

696
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,878
connected with the missing homeless.

697
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:25,778
- How?

698
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:28,948

Thank you, Mrs. Andrews, for the number.

While I still have you on the line,

711
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,473
could I ask you a few questions

712
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,938
for the story on Father Michaels?

713
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:07,267
- Of course.

714
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:09,267
- How long have you known the father?

715
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:10,678
- Just a couple of weeks.

716
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:11,808
- [Kyle] How did you meet him?

717
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,948
- He came to a function I was attending,

718
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,648
and he enlightened my world.

- How so?

720
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:18,578
- With his teachings, he opened my eyes

721
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:21,167
to what the world is and
what the world could be.

722
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:22,167
- [Kyle] What could it be?

723
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,197
- All the pain and hurt
in the world can be gone,

724
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,788
and it can be a world
where the darkest night

725
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,755
could be as bright as the noonday sun.

726
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:29,648
- Okay.

727
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:31,418
- Well, I'm not doing it justice.

728
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,058
You'll just have to get him to explain it.

729
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,643
- So you think a lot of Father Michaels?

730
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,868
- Oh yes, very much so.

731
00:34:38,935 --> 00:34:40,468
I would do anything for him.

732
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:42,698
- Well, Mrs. Andrews,
thank you for your time.

733
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:46,257
If I have any further
questions, I'll be in touch.

734
00:34:46,324 --> 00:34:47,158
Bye.

735
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,100
[buttons punching softly]

736
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:08,648
- Michaels' residence.

737
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,082
- Is Father Michaels available?

738
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,328
This is Kyle Deeders with the Gazette.

739
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:14,839
- Father Michaels is currently
unavailable right now.

740
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:16,548
- With whom am I speaking?

741
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,508
- I'm Boris, his personal assistant.

742
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,578
- Boris, Father Michaels
said I should call

743
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:23,508
and make an appointment to interview him.

744
00:35:23,575 --> 00:35:26,436
- He's free tomorrow
evening, at say 8:00 PM.

745
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:27,588
- [Kyle] That would be great.

746
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:30,147
- The address is 796 Roanoke Road.

747
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,167
- Got it.

748
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,829
I'll be there.

749
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:35,729
Thank you.

750
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:42,187
[phone ringing]

751
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,298
Deeders.

752
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:46,798
Oh, hi, Larry.

753
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:48,048
Did you find that kid?

754
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,178
Not there, huh?

755
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:53,018
I hope she's okay.

756
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,858
Oh?

757
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:58,105
Why would I be interested in a homicide

758
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:00,418
when I'm working on this homeless story?

759
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:02,187
Attacked by a group of women?

760
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,548
Yeah.

761
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:05,688
What's the address?

762
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:11,171
Got it, I'll see you there.

763
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:26,668
Kyle Deeders with the Gazette.

764
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,072
- No.

765
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:29,368
- Do you know who I am?

766
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:31,057
- Yes, and still no.

767
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,438
Dom, hey Dom!

768
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:36,822
- Let him in.

769
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:37,722
- Thanks.

770
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,398
- Asshole.

771
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:46,548
- Victim is one Dawn Shaw, age 36.

772
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:49,918
Time of death is approximately 3:26 AM.

773
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:52,518
Cause of death is unknown at this time.

774
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,568
- Here, here, here, here.

775
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:03,488
- Did she die here?

776
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,388
- Yep.

777
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:12,103
[camera shutter clicking]

778
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:21,458
- What's with the puncture marks?

779
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:24,468
- We'll have to have the
coroner tell us about that.

780
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,431
- Larry said she was
attacked by a group of women.

781
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,278
- Let the witness tell you.

782
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,228
Whack job, if you ask me.

783
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:32,908
Name's Chris Shaw, the husband.

784
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:34,868
This way.

785
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:35,768
Watch your step.

786
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,630
[footsteps thudding]

787
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:48,219
- Kyle.
- Larry.

788
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:51,168
- This is Mr. Shaw, he's
the victim's husband.

789
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:56,698
- Mr. Shaw, I am very sorry for your loss.

790
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,787
My name is Kyle Deeders with the Gazette.

791
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:01,588
Can you tell me what happened?

792
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:05,368
- Dawn was out with her friends.

793
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:09,778
Every couple of months they
would have a girls' night out.

794
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,798
I'd always wait up and make sure she

795
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,548
made it home before going to bed.

796
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:23,585
Anyway, Dawn started
screaming and yelling for me.

797
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:30,064
So I ran into the living room
and they were all over her.

798
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:31,611
- Who was?

799
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:33,248
- Those women.

800
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:37,298
There were seven or eight of them.

801
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,897
They were biting her.

802
00:38:38,964 --> 00:38:43,572
I tried to pull them away,
but they were so strong.

803
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:47,997
I punched one as hard as I could,

804
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,828
but she just looked at me.

805
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,987
She grabbed me and she
threw me down the hallway.

806
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:57,654
- Threw you?

807
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:59,608
- I made that crack in the wall.

808
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,458
- That's gotta be a good 10 feet.

809
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,024
- And when I hit, this fell off the wall.

810
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:11,111
I grabbed it and it saved my life.

811
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:14,238
- How, did you use it like a weapon?

812
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:18,168
- No, It was the power of God.

813
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,365
It kept them away.

814
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:23,715
- Why is that?

815
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:27,854
- It's obvious.

816
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,672
[dramatic music]

817
00:39:31,565 --> 00:39:33,005
They're vampires.

818
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:33,904
- Vam...

819
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:43,568
Mr. Shaw, are you saying that your wife

820
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:47,867
was killed by the undead?

821
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:49,623
By vampires?

822
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,598
- [cries] I wasn't able to save her.

823
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,225
Yes.

824
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:58,292
Yes, they were vampires.

825
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:03,378
- Okay, thank you.

826
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:06,798
If you can think of anything
else, give me a call.

827
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,084
[door creaking]

828
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:33,011
Funny.

829
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:33,843
[officers laughing]

830
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,078
You guys are a laugh riot.

831
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:39,757
- When he said vampires,
I told Larry to call you.

832
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:41,418
- Ah, your face was priceless.

833
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,488
It was all I could do to keep
from cracking up in there.

834
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,777
- So what killed the woman?

835
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,628
- Don't know, but I'm ruling out vampires.

836
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:50,528
- [Kyle] Yeah.

837
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:55,188
- I don't know what happened
but it traumatized Mr. Shaw

838
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:57,138
so much that he made that story up.

839
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,298
- It could be the people that are

840
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:00,108
taking the homeless though.

841
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:02,456
Bunch of women attacking someone?

842
00:41:02,523 --> 00:41:04,408
- That's a long shot.

843
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:10,158
- Maybe.

844
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,039
[cars whooshing]
[distant radio music]

845
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:30,338
Huh, spot up front.

846
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:32,328
My lucky night.

847
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:37,669
[cellphone ringing]

848
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:43,930
Deeders?

849
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:46,378
- [Chris] Mr. Deeders, you have
to get over here right now.

850
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:48,228
- Get over where?

851
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,205
- [Chris] This is Chris Shaw.

852
00:41:50,272 --> 00:41:51,854
Dawn, Dawn is back.

853
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:53,898
Please come.

854
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:56,474
- Wait, your dead wife is back?

855
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,773
- [Chris] Yes, I told
you they were vampires.

856
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,488
Could you please come?

857
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,655
- I'll be right there.

858
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:08,938
Hi, Larry.

859
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:12,448
Yes, I know what time it is.

860
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:16,258
Shaw just called me.

861
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:20,777
Says his dead wife just
came back as a vampire.

862
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:26,208
He says he has her trapped.

863
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,098
Yep, I'll meet you there.

864
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:35,277
[suspenseful music]

865
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:04,088
You boys are fast.

866
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:07,868
- We got here a little faster when we

867
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:10,948
found out Mrs. Shaw's body
is missing from the morgue.

868
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:12,798
- You gotta be shitting me?

869
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:13,958
- Nope.

870
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,948
- Is it possible she wasn't dead?

871
00:43:16,015 --> 00:43:17,731
- Kyle, you saw her.

872
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:27,908
[hand knocking]

873
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:28,928
- This way, hurry!

874
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:32,737
I have her trapped in the basement.

875
00:43:32,804 --> 00:43:35,458
- Mr. Shaw, who do you have
trapped in the basement?

876
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:36,358
- Dawn.

877
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:38,069
- Mr. Shaw, your wife is dead.

878
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:42,808
- I know that, she's one
of those, those things.

879
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,075
- Tell us what happened.

880
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:46,837
- I was in bed.

881
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:49,058
I heard a noise.

882
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,251
I knew it was her, she was coming for me.

883
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:52,855
She, she wanted to...

884
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:58,158
I used the cross and backed
her up into the basement.

885
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:00,150
I locked the door and called you guys.

886
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:01,278
Up until you knocked,

887
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:03,758
she's been talking to me through the door,

888
00:44:03,825 --> 00:44:05,180
begging me to let her out.

889
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,218
- Okay, we'll check it out.

890
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:07,235
You stay back here.

891
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,990
[suspenseful music]

892
00:44:25,148 --> 00:44:27,550
Mrs. Shaw, are you down there?

893
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:29,118
This is the police.

894
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:34,637
If anybody's down there,
make your presence known.

895
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:36,488
We're armed, and we will fire.

896
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:42,222
We're coming down now.

897
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:47,504
[suspenseful music]

898
00:45:04,763 --> 00:45:07,096
Deeders, stay at the stairs.

899
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:19,312

Jesus!

913
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,773
- You shot her in the fucking head!

914
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,378
- Well, that's how you
kill vampires, isn't it?

915
00:46:10,445 --> 00:46:11,648
- That's zombies.

916
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:13,968
- Well, it looks like it fucking worked.

917
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:19,257
[sighs] So we all need
to be on the same page

918
00:46:19,324 --> 00:46:21,288
to explain this.

919
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:23,437
I mean, we saw her dead this afternoon.

920
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:25,477
- [Larry] You shot her
in the fucking head!

921
00:46:25,544 --> 00:46:27,068
- [Dom] Stop stating the obvious.

922
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:28,908
- [Kyle] But that's not
how you kill a vampire.

923
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:30,858
- [Dom] A bullet to the
head will kill a zombie,

924
00:46:30,925 --> 00:46:33,588
a vampire or fucking Mother Teresa.

925
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:35,407
Can we get on with how to explain this?

926
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,128
- [Kyle] What is there to explain?

927
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,818
She is a vampire!

928
00:46:38,885 --> 00:46:41,758
- [Dom] Right, we'll just tell
the captain she's a vampire.

929
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:44,058
He'll buy that, no fucking problem.

930
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,358
- [Kyle] Do you have a better answer?

931
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:48,318
- [Dom] No, but I'm not telling anybody

932
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:49,998
she's a fucking vampire.

933
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:51,688
- [Kyle] Was she really dead?

934
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:55,725
- Obviously not, but she
is not a fucking vamp...

935
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,913
Oh fuck.

- What the fuck do we do now?

940
00:47:17,215 --> 00:47:19,178
- It didn't happen.

941
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:20,108
- What?

942
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:22,738
- Did we get our asses
kicked by a dead woman.

943
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,427
- It happened.

944
00:47:24,494 --> 00:47:26,238
- No, it didn't.

945
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,978
Nobody will believe it.

946
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,028
We forget about it.

947
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:31,928
- What do I do?

948
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:33,978
- If I were you, I would move.

949
00:47:37,725 --> 00:47:41,855
- So you're telling me she's a vampire.

950
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:43,578
- I don't want to say that,

951
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:46,198
but all the facts point in that direction.

952
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:48,068
- Well, maybe you don't have all the facts

953
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:50,664
or the facts are different
from what you think.

954
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:53,518
- You're telling me she isn't a vampire.

955
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:55,477
- I'm telling you to dig deeper.

956
00:47:55,544 --> 00:47:57,148
Don't just stop at one angle.

957
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:58,628
We don't know all the facts.

958
00:47:58,695 --> 00:47:59,998
For example, how do we know she was

959
00:48:00,065 --> 00:48:01,444
really dead to begin with?

960
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,268
- She laid there all afternoon.

961
00:48:04,335 --> 00:48:06,377
No pulse, not breathing.

962
00:48:06,444 --> 00:48:09,068
I'd say that was a fair indicator.

963
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:10,858
- There are drugs that can simulate death.

964
00:48:10,925 --> 00:48:12,357
- George.
- I'm just saying.

965
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:14,198
Check all the possibilities.

966
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,838
For example, these people
taking the missing homeless.

967
00:48:16,905 --> 00:48:19,382
How do we know the guy was even a priest?

968
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:21,688
- I suppose.

969
00:48:21,755 --> 00:48:23,337
Oh shit, that reminds me.

970
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:25,407
I need to do some research
on Father Michaels

971
00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:27,098
before my interview tonight.

972
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:31,638
Okay, let's see what we can find out

973
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:36,705
about Father Sebastian Roderick Michaels.

974
00:48:41,905 --> 00:48:43,297
Here we go.

975
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:48,364
Michaels and his loyal followers
move around quite a bit.

Halloween come early?

978
00:48:59,925 --> 00:49:01,988
- Ha ha, very funny.

979
00:49:04,085 --> 00:49:04,868
I'm going undercover.

980
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:08,257
I'm spending the night on the
street as a homeless person.

981
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:09,828
- You shouldn't do that.

982
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:10,661
- Why not?

983
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:12,925
Afraid my story will have
more depth than yours?

984
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:17,148
- Oh yeah, that's it, I'm so afraid.

985
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:20,668
No, really, It's too dangerous out there.

986
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:23,428
- I'm a big girl, I can handle myself.

987
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:26,437
- I'm sure you can, but
I don't think you should.

988
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:30,028
Look, Susan, I'm not kidding.

989
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:32,208
There are things you don't know.

990
00:49:32,275 --> 00:49:33,728
- Then I'm going to find out.

991
00:49:33,795 --> 00:49:36,168
You can't stop me, I'm doing this.

992
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:38,068
- Okay, I tried.

993
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:40,257
- And as usual, you failed.

994
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:41,488
- Whatever.

995
00:49:41,555 --> 00:49:42,387
Have fun.

996
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,438

997
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,832
I'll be bringing back a great article.

No I don't, uh, uh.

1011
00:50:40,324 --> 00:50:42,141
I have to get back to
work, I don't have time.

1012
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,331
- I know you don't have time.

1013
00:50:43,398 --> 00:50:45,150
- But you texted me to come over.

1014
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:47,358
- Because we're gonna celebrate tonight.

1015
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:48,545
- Really, what for?

1016
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,868
- The story about the
disappearing homeless people.

1017
00:50:50,935 --> 00:50:52,867
- Mm-hmm.
- I blew it wide open.

1018
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:53,838
- Did you really?

1019
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:55,335
- After tonight's exclusive interview.

1020
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:56,428
- Uh huh.

1021
00:50:56,495 --> 00:50:58,805
- It's gonna be everywhere,
and it's gonna be big.

1022
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:00,868
- That'd be so wonderful for you.

1023
00:51:01,815 --> 00:51:03,348
- So.
- Hmm.

1024
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:04,638
- Why don't you come there after work.

1025
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:05,471
- Mm-hmm.

1026
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:06,808
- I'll swing by and pick up dinner

1027
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,658
at Tavola's and some wine.

1028
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:11,338

- Maybe even some champagne.

I have an appointment
with Father Michaels.

- Father Michaels?

1055

- Don't understand why
people fear zombies.

They're so slow and weak.

to see you now, sir.

00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:33,709
- What are your causes?

1079
00:54:33,776 --> 00:54:37,007
- I like to help
communities grow and thrive.

1080
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,858
I like to help the less fortunate.

1081
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:42,057
- Like the homeless?

1082
00:54:42,124 --> 00:54:43,468
- Hmm.

1083
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:45,188
Yes, the homeless.

1084
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:47,838
I like to take the
lifeblood of the community

1085
00:54:47,905 --> 00:54:51,258
and mold it into a
better living situation.

1086
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:54,828
- Are you affiliated
with a church somewhere?

1087
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:58,478
- My congregation follows me.

1088
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,258
They live here with me.

1089
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:02,258
- Wow, how many are there?

1090
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:06,108
- We have 12 currently,
but we're always growing.

1091
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:08,138
- May I interview some of them?

1092
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:10,937
- Mm, I'm afraid not.

1093
00:55:11,004 --> 00:55:12,848
Most have physical disfigurements,

1094
00:55:12,915 --> 00:55:15,688
and they don't like to be around others.

1095
00:55:15,755 --> 00:55:17,004
- I understand.

1096
00:55:17,986 --> 00:55:20,258
So I did some research.

1097
00:55:20,325 --> 00:55:22,128
You move around every few months.

1098
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:26,718
- Hmm, yes, I like to help
as many people as possible.

1099
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:28,298
Don't you think, hmm?

1100
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:30,338
So yes, we do move often.

1101
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:33,368
- McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

1102
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,408
Easley, South Carolina.

1103
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:37,178
North Little Rock, Arkansas.

1104
00:55:37,245 --> 00:55:40,318
Beaumont, Texas, and
the list goes on and on.

1105
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:41,710
Very impressive.

1106
00:55:41,777 --> 00:55:43,493
- As is your research.

1107
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,917
Thank you.

1108
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:49,588
- I also noticed that in those cities

1109
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:52,628
there was a sharp decline
in the homeless population.

1110
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:56,318
- Really, hmm?

1111
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:57,818
Well, I'd assume the work we did

1112
00:55:57,885 --> 00:55:59,578
had something to do with it.

1113
00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:00,678
- Oh, I'm sure of it.

1114
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:02,248
The homeless population practically

1115
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,984
disappeared from each city.

1116
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:05,558
[Father Michaels laughs]

1117
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:10,625
I think that credit belongs to you, 100%.

1118
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:15,158
- [laughs] I can't take
full credit for it.

1119
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:17,608
- Father, you're being too modest.

1120
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:20,248
I've got a gut feeling that you

1121
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:22,488
are the driving force behind it all.

1122
00:56:23,924 --> 00:56:27,758
- Mr. Deeders, I find you to
be a very interesting man.

1123
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:31,508
And I look forward to
continuing this conversation

1124
00:56:31,575 --> 00:56:32,778
in the near future.

1125
00:56:32,845 --> 00:56:35,166
- Continuing the conversation?

1126
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:38,308
- I have a prior engagement
that slipped my mind

1127
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,969
until this very moment.

1128
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:41,732
Boris will show you out.

1129
00:56:45,052 --> 00:56:48,158
- Well, Father, I appreciate your time.

1130
00:56:49,485 --> 00:56:53,238
- We'll finish this
conversation in the near future.

1131
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:56,358
- Have a good night, Father.

1132
00:56:58,065 --> 00:56:59,935
- Likewise.

1133
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:03,003
[suspenseful music]

1134
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,841

[suspenseful music]

1136
00:57:22,585 --> 00:57:23,978
- I did it.

1137
00:57:24,045 --> 00:57:27,030
I got him dead to rights, and he knows it.

1138
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:30,098
I walked out of there all in one piece.

1139
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:35,258
Celebrate tonight, write the story

1140
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:37,877
that's gonna blow this case wide open.

1141
00:57:37,944 --> 00:57:41,328
Start looking for New
York job offers next week!

1142
00:57:49,005 --> 00:57:50,418
Hi, babe.

1143
00:57:50,485 --> 00:57:52,138
I'm on my way to La Tavola's.

1144
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:53,854
Should be there in about an hour.

1145
00:57:55,425 --> 00:57:57,678
Yes, it's definitely a celebration.

1146
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,448
Love you.

1147
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:02,418
See you in a few.

1148
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:06,606

[door bangs]

1151
00:58:26,914 --> 00:58:29,978
- Interesting interview,
don't you think, hmm?

1152
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:30,877
- Yes, Master.

1153
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:35,048
- I believe Mr. Deeders thinks
he knows all my secrets.

1154
00:58:36,784 --> 00:58:37,618
- Yes, Master.

1155
00:58:48,515 --> 00:58:49,912
- Summon the girls.

1156
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:52,418
- Yes, Master.

1157
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:57,583
[suspenseful music]

1158
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:07,956
[Kyle whistles]

1159
00:59:12,813 --> 00:59:13,647
- Fuck.

1160

[vampires hissing]

1161
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,548
- Take them to his house.

1162
00:59:24,505 --> 00:59:28,198
I want you to bring the reporter
to me and I want him alive.

1163
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:32,428
Kat, you're in charge.

1164
00:59:33,551 --> 00:59:34,823
[vampires hissing]

1165
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,268
- I will not let you down, Master.

1166
00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:41,868
- Yes, it's just going very slowly.

1167
00:59:41,935 --> 00:59:44,878
These lugnuts seem like they're rusted on.

1168
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:47,486
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

1169
00:59:47,553 --> 00:59:50,588
The restaurant is keeping
the food warm for us.

1170
00:59:53,095 --> 00:59:54,438
Probably another hour.

1171
00:59:56,235 --> 00:59:57,068
Okay.

1172
00:59:58,915 --> 00:59:59,747
Love you too.

1173
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:01,508
Bye.

1174
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:04,734
Fucking cars.

[Rachel cries]

1198
01:02:21,925 --> 01:02:23,148
- It is his woman.

1199
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:27,058
- Did I ask you for his woman?

1200
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:29,182
- No Master, but he was not there.

1201
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,058
So I thought if we took
her, he would come to us.

1202
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:37,188
- So you thought, did you?

1203
01:02:38,703 --> 01:02:40,878
Hmm.

1204
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,607
Did I ask you to think?

1205
01:02:44,466 --> 01:02:45,299
Did I?

Yes, he will come for you.

1212

We need to get you ready for
him, don't you think, hmm?

Rachel!

1219

- Okay, one more fucking time.

1220
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:55,814
You can't think of anybody
else out to get you.

1221
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:57,848
- Why are we still going over this?

1222
01:03:57,915 --> 01:04:00,808
You two have kept me
here for over 10 hours.

1223
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,018
- Deeders, we need the truth in order

1224
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:03,948
to find your girlfriend, man.

1225
01:04:04,015 --> 01:04:07,397
- I've told you the truth
over and over again.

1226
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:10,708
- Bullshit, I think you know
more than you're telling us.

1227
01:04:10,775 --> 01:04:11,788
- I'm done talking.

1228
01:04:11,855 --> 01:04:15,467
Unless you charge me with
something, I'm outta here!

1229
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:18,648
- You're not being charged,
but don't leave town.

1230
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:19,918
- No problem.

1231
01:04:24,645 --> 01:04:25,477
- Fucking prick.

[suspenseful music]

1234
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,512
- Kyle, wait up.

1235
01:04:40,145 --> 01:04:41,345
- We heard about Rachel.

1236
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:43,728
- I need your help.

1237
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:46,728
- What do you need from us?

1238
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:48,407
- I know who has her.

1239
01:04:48,474 --> 01:04:50,738
- Great, did you tell the detectives?

1240
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:52,447
- No, because you two are the only ones

1241
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:53,748
that will believe me.

1242
01:04:55,384 --> 01:04:57,618
The leader of the vampires has her.

1243
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,517
- Oh, come on.

1244
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:02,397
- You saw one of them, you
shot her in the fucking head.

1245
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:03,665
- Hey, quiet about that.

1246
01:05:07,745 --> 01:05:09,347
- Look, I need your help.

1247
01:05:09,414 --> 01:05:12,678
If you don't help me, I'm
still going in by myself.

1248
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,518
- What do you need from us?

1249
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:17,417
- They have her in a
mansion up by Mulberry Hill.

1250
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,788
I need you two to help
me search the place.

1251
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:22,238
We need to be in and out before sundown.

1252
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,545
- We'll follow you up there.

1253
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:29,968
- But we're not doing anything
that can cost us our jobs.

1254
01:05:30,035 --> 01:05:31,128
- Fine, whatever.

1255
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:32,058
We need to move.

[zipper clattering]

1257
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:49,210
Holy water.

1258
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:53,708
Here.

1259
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,397
- What are we supposed to do with this?

1260
01:05:55,464 --> 01:05:56,848
- You use it to kill a vampire.

1261
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:58,208
You drive it through it's heart.

1262
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:00,347
- No way, we're not killing anybody.

1263
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:04,158
- Take it or don't, but it
might end up saving your life.

1264
01:06:05,245 --> 01:06:06,953
- Where did you even get these?

1265
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:10,648
- I had these made before I
had my interview with Michaels.

1266
01:06:10,715 --> 01:06:12,758
- Okay, what's the plan?

1267
01:06:13,725 --> 01:06:16,306
- We find a way in, find Rachel,

1268
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:18,738
and kill any vampire who gets in our way.

1269
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:21,307
- We can't go in there
without a search warrant.

1270
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:22,518
- What about probable cause?

1271
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:24,588
- You don't have any reason
to believe she's in there.

1272
01:06:24,655 --> 01:06:26,578
We could lose our badges.

1273
01:06:26,645 --> 01:06:29,048
- How about we just go
up and knock politely.

1274
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:30,728
See if we gain access that way.

1275
01:06:30,795 --> 01:06:31,638
- Do what you want.

1276
01:06:31,705 --> 01:06:33,855
I'm gonna go around
back and try to get in.

1277
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:35,828
The sun's going down.

1278
01:06:37,523 --> 01:06:39,558
They're going to be waking up.

1279
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:44,387
We don't have much time.

[fist banging]

1291
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:37,332
Maybe there's no one home.

1292
01:07:41,715 --> 01:07:43,088
- Or maybe there is.

[door creaking]

1294
01:07:47,665 --> 01:07:50,318
- Hi, my name's Detective Smith.

1295
01:07:50,385 --> 01:07:51,738
This is Detective Jones.

1296
01:07:51,805 --> 01:07:53,774
May we come inside?

1297
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:55,048
- Of course.

1298
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:08,988
How can I help you?

1299
01:08:09,055 --> 01:08:11,648
- We have a report that a
missing woman may be here.

1300
01:08:11,715 --> 01:08:12,948
- I can assure you nobody's here

1301
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:15,318
that's not supposed to be here.

1302
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:16,838
- You won't mind if we
take a look around then.

1303
01:08:16,905 --> 01:08:17,978
- Actually I would.

1304
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:20,558
You see, Father Michaels
and the congregation

1305
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:23,079
are currently in deep meditation,

1306
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:25,114
and they cannot be disturbed at this time.

1307
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:26,625
- We'll be really quiet.

1308
01:08:26,692 --> 01:08:27,458
- I'm sorry.

1309
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:29,488
It's my job to make sure
they're not to be bothered.

1310
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:31,318
I'm gonna have to ask
the two of you to leave.

1311
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:32,978
- My job is to find that woman,

1312
01:08:33,045 --> 01:08:34,798
and I'm going to search this house.

1313
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:36,408
- Not without a search warrant.

1314
01:08:36,475 --> 01:08:38,768
Do you have a search warrant, detective?

1315
01:08:38,835 --> 01:08:41,217
- No, but I've got probable cause.

1316
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,117
- I don't think so, nothing
that'll hold up in court.

1317
01:08:44,184 --> 01:08:45,491
If you try to search this house,

1318
01:08:45,558 --> 01:08:46,898
I will have your badge.

1319
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:48,018
- Listen here, you son of a bitch.

1320
01:08:48,085 --> 01:08:50,341
- No, let's go.

1321
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:51,883
We'll get a warrant.

1322
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,898
[door creaking]
- We will be back.

1323
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:57,668

- So what now?

1327
01:09:10,095 --> 01:09:12,858
- I don't think we can get a
warrant based on what we have.

1328
01:09:12,925 --> 01:09:15,005
- No, I don't think we can either.

1329
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:16,672
But we can't leave Kyle hanging.

1330
01:09:18,505 --> 01:09:20,048
- Wait, you see that?

1331
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:22,438
- What?

1332
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:25,177
- Somebody's breaking into
the back of that mansion.

1333
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,624
We need to check that out.

1334
01:09:26,691 --> 01:09:27,774
- Absolutely.

1335
01:09:29,435 --> 01:09:30,268
Oh shit.

1336
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,606
- What?

1337
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:35,172
- Look at the sun.

1338
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:37,033

1346
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,628
- You still want to go in?

1347
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,248
- No, but we've got no choice.

1348
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:57,318
- You got your cross?

1349
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:02,238

Please don't.

- Do you, you think you could walk?

1357

- I can damn well try.

Susan, can you hear me?

Where's the rest?

this was too dangerous.

Are you not leaving?

01:12:59,185 --> 01:13:00,037
I can stay.

- You guys are too weak to help.

1383
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,751
Just get them outta here.

1384
01:13:04,818 --> 01:13:05,618
- Okay.

1385
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:06,735
- I came in that way,

1386
01:13:06,802 --> 01:13:09,518
but I can't remember the way after that.

1387
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,351

You just go get Rachel, okay.

1389
01:13:14,525 --> 01:13:16,978
- Kyle, thank you for saving us.

1390
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:18,298
- Oh, you would've done the same.

1391
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:21,228
- I want to give you something.

1392
01:13:21,295 --> 01:13:22,778
It might come in handy.

1393
01:13:26,425 --> 01:13:27,748
- You had this all the time.

1394
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:29,418
Why didn't you try to use it?

1395
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:30,585
- I couldn't reach it.

1396
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:33,058
Good luck, my friend.
