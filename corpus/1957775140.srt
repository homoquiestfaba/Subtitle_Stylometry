00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:34,444
I just wish...

188
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:38,153
Momma.

189
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:40,986
Nothin son.

190
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:44,778
Thinking about Daddy right?

191
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:49,861
It's just too bad he couldn't
be here when you came home.

192
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:53,819
Did he suffer much before he died?

193
00:23:53,869 --> 00:24:01,111
Well, it wasn't easy for him,
but he did the best he could.

194
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:05,069
He had a lot of regrets.

195
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,903
Things he..

196
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,486
He couldn't change.

197
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:13,236
Was he disappointed in me?

198
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:18,694
Oh, No. He was more worried that
he wasn't a good Father.

199
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:19,778
Well, it wasn't his fault.

200
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:23,819
I know son.

201
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,403
Just you know he...

202
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:32,736
He came from a long line of well...

203
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:35,236
Troubled people.

204
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:36,819
Looks like I'm following him
right along huh?

205
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:39,736
Don't you dare say that.

206
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:42,028
This is your chance.

207
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:46,986
To do something different.

208
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:49,194
It's up to you son.

209
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:50,861
Not sure where to start.

210
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:53,069
Well...

211
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,611
You just have to take some time,

212
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:59,069
and uh..

213
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,903
Just keep moving.

214
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:05,819
That's what I did when your daddy died.

215
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,528
I just kept living.

216
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:14,528
One day at a time.

217
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:17,653
Some nights I would...

218
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:21,194
I'd pull out empty boxes and...

219
00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:26,361
Id start to pack all of his stuff.

220
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:33,028
And other nights I'd just
drink my self to sleep.

221
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,736
Well I'm sorry Mom.

222
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:38,403
You don't ever have to be sorry.

223
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:43,611
You just have to be ok.

224
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:53,194
Not a bad looking horse.

225
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:55,944
Got some age on him, but still
looks pretty good.

226
00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:57,944
Where'd you get him?

227
00:25:57,994 --> 00:25:59,903
Traded some old boy my guitar.

228
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:01,236
Is that right?

229
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:03,569
Yea, he was either going to turn
him loose or turn him into dog food,

230
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:04,861
and I couldn't let that happen.

231
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,778
No sir.

232
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:09,611
Hm.

233
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:13,444
I am downright ashamed the way I
let this place go.

234

Hm.

236
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:24,986
Well I hope you'd do me a favor
and help me put it back in order.

237
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:27,569
Yea, well I'd be happy to Mom.

238
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:32,319
It'll keep me busy while I'm
figuring some things out.

239
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,361
Also I got something for you.

240
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,653
Oh, hey Mom I'm fine, I'm
getting money in a few weeks.

241
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,403
Well you're going to need some until then,

242
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:44,278
so don't argue with me just take it.

243
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:45,944
And uh..

244
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:49,111
I got something else for you.

245
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:52,486
Keys to your Daddy's truck.

246
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:57,361
It may need a battery, but I bet
you it still runs pretty good.

247
00:26:57,411 --> 00:27:00,361
I bet your Daddy's going to
look down and get a big chuckle.

248
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,861
Cause you were always so
embarrassed when he drove it.

249
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:05,194
Remember that?

250
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:07,444
Serves me right I guess, huh?

251
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:09,819
Yea it does.

252
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,278

258
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,528
I stepped on a rake.

I need ten bales of alfalfa.

I think we can manage that.
Anything else?

265
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,444
Yea I don't know what kind of
horse feed you have,

266
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:30,819
but I need something that would
be good for an old horse.

267
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:33,611
Well we have a lot of products with
glucose amine, it's good for older horses.

Glucosa what?

269
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,611
Glucose amine.

270
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:39,861
It's a feed supplement.

271
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:40,986
Ok.

272
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:43,319

Well as a matter of fact I have.

It wasn't murder Larry, it was
vehicular homicide.

369
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:35,719
What are you defending him?

370
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,302
No.

371
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:39,719
I'm just saying...

372
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:42,260
Trust me, I don't think its right.

373
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,510
Him walking around a free man
after what he did.

374
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,344
Well what are we going to do about it?

375
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:52,344
I don't think I know what you mean.

376
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,594
See you guys.

377
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:55,844
See you boys in church Sunday.

378
00:35:55,894 --> 00:35:59,135
Alright.

379
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:02,385
I'm not a big fan of Eden Jackson ok?

380
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,052
But if he don't do nothing wrong..

381
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:08,677
We can keep bothering him.

382
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:11,052
Ahem.

383
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,969
Let me ask you a question Gerry.

384
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:17,510
I mean correct me if I'm wrong but..

385
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,969
Didn't I have something to do
with you becoming Sheriff?

386
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,760
You know you did.

387
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,510
Yea.

388
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,385
Well I need a little help here, ya see?

389
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:32,552
I don't need this Eden
Jackson, this ex con, in my life.

390
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:34,385
You hear what I'm saying?

391
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,385
Can I get you boys anything else?

392
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:40,219
I'll tell you what sweetheart.

393
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,552
How about...

394
00:36:42,602 --> 00:36:46,844
A slice of that delicious apple
pie, and a cup of coffee.

395
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:48,510
Sure thing Mr. Hannigan.

396
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,052
Oh you call me Larry, ok?

397
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:50,678
Ok.

398
00:36:50,738 --> 00:36:51,559
Ok.

399
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:00,760
You understand what I'm saying here?

400
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,760
Whats the matter Larry, you
think that pretty young wife of yours

401
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,927
is just going to pack up and leave?

402
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,719
You watch your mouth, Baker.

403
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm sorry I'm just trying...

404
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,094
No, you're just nothing.

405
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:14,760
I don't need this son of a
gun marching in here,

406
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,344
and screwing up my life.

407
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:18,469
It's not going to happen, understand?

408
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,885
It's not going to happen.

409
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:26,385
I'm sure between the three of
us we can figure something out.

410
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:29,010
Here you go Larry.

411
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,552
Wow.

412
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:33,219
Why thank you Violet.

413
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:40,760
Almost as pretty as you.

414
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,302
What are you looking at a bird, Dog?

415
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:48,427
You wouldn't know what to do with that.

416
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,635
Hey buddy, good morning.

417
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:00,469
How are you?

418
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:04,719
Big fella...

419
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:05,409
Alright.

420
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:20,608
Hello Eden.

421
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:23,427
Hmm, your uh...

422
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:27,677
You're Momma told me you picked up
a horse on your way back from prison.

423
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:32,385
Yea, I guess you can say that.

424
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,696
What brings you out here?

425
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,344
Just wanted to see you.

426
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,810
Could of seen me plenty over the
last 8 years, why now?

427
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:43,885
Curious I guess.

428
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:45,635
Curious.

429
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:47,260
Curious about what?

430
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,344
Maybe curious to see how you
made it through.

431
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,052
Couldn't have been easy.

432
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:55,677
Nope.

433
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:57,719
So you mad at me?

434
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,385
Mad at you for what?

435
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:01,318
Come on Eden you know what I'm
talking about.

436
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:02,673
You moved on, what can I say?

437
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:05,177
I had no choice.

438
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:08,177
If you say so.

439
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:11,344
I was devastated Eden, you have
no idea what I went through.

440
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:14,927
The sheets weren't even cold before
Larry Hannigan moved in my bed.

441
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,159
What do you expect me to do
after what happened?

442
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:18,574
It was an accident Pam.

443
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:22,286
Oh right, cheating on me was no accident.

444
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,719
I didn't come here to argue with you.

445
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,552
Yea, well why did you come?

446
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:29,844
I came to tell you something.

447
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:31,177
Well than say it.

448
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:34,177
You got something to say, say it!!

449
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,594
You want to tell me what a no
good piece of garbage I am,

450
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:38,885
and how I deserve all of this?

451
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,802
I know that’s what you're thinking.

452
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:45,594
Never mind, it's no use talking to you.

453
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:46,760
You know what...

454
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,969
I feel sorry for you Eden, I really do.

455
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,844
You had everything.

456
00:39:52,894 --> 00:40:00,894
You pushed it away.

457
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:09,677
-Music-

458
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:30,427
Can I get you something?

459
00:41:30,477 --> 00:41:32,469
Uh, soda please.

460
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,302
Sure.

461
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:51,360
Hello.

462
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:53,931
Hello Dad.

463
00:43:22,253 --> 00:43:25,649
How you doing?

464
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:33,661
Bout the same.

465
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:37,916
I brought you something.

466
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:43,911
Huh?

467
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:46,620
They gave me permission.

468
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,161
You can keep it.

469
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:57,828
It's a classic 1962 Martin.

470
00:43:57,878 --> 00:44:00,203
Your pal Jake helped me pick it out.

471
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:03,161
Sounds pretty good.

472
00:44:03,211 --> 00:44:05,870
It is beautiful Dad.

473
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,120
[Guitar strumming]

474
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,995
He said to say hello.

475
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:14,036
[Sigh]

476
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:19,078
Sent you a license plate with
his name on it.

477
00:44:19,128 --> 00:44:26,828
That rotten son of a gun.

478
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:31,433
Well I thought it would help the
time pass here.

479
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:36,286
I don't know what to say.

480
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:38,453
Oh you don't have to say nothin,
just write some pretty music,

481
00:44:38,503 --> 00:44:42,745
so I can tap my foot to it.

482
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:46,036
Alright.

483
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:48,411
Ok I will.

484
00:44:53,086 --> 00:44:55,411
Hi.

485
00:44:55,461 --> 00:44:58,453
Hello.

486
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:00,411
Hi.

487
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:02,536
I thought that was you over here.

488
00:45:02,586 --> 00:45:03,495
I hope I'm not bothering.

489
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:06,870
No, not at all.

490
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,745
I just came by to listen to my
old buddy play some music.

491
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:10,870
They're really good.

492
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,411
Yea, yea they are.

493
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,286
Why don't you have a seat.

494
00:45:16,336 --> 00:45:18,495
Sure.

495
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:19,911
I'll sit down for a sec.

496
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:21,786
I um...

497
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:24,620
I really just wanted to apologize
for what I said the other day.

498
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,203
I had no idea.

499
00:45:27,253 --> 00:45:32,161
No worries, it is what it is ya know?

500
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:35,495
I'm Eden Jackson by the way.

501
00:45:35,545 --> 00:45:36,286
Shelly.

502
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:37,536
Nice to meet you Shelly.

503
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,036
Likewise.

504
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:40,661
So uh..

505
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,786
How long have you worked down at
the feed store.

506
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:46,786
Well actually, I bought it about
three years ago.

507
00:45:46,836 --> 00:45:48,078
Really?

508
00:45:48,128 --> 00:45:48,995
Good for you.

509
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:52,036
Yea, I enjoy it.

510
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:54,370
I’ve always had a thing for
taking care of animals.

511
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,495
Is that right?

512
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,411
Yea.

513
00:45:57,461 --> 00:46:01,953
I thought Id be a vet, but it
didn't really work out.

514
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:10,003
You know what they say it's
never too late.

515
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:15,870
Well, I don't want to intrude.
I just want to apologize.

516
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,828
Tell your friend I think he's really good.

517
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:21,161
Yea, I'll tell him.

518
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,995
I'm sure I'll see you around, sometime.

519
00:46:25,045 --> 00:46:29,203
And you know, if you need
anything for your horse, whatever...

520
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,786
You know where I am.

521
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:33,703
I do.

522
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:35,411
Um...

523
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:37,536
Look Eden, I don't want to...

524
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,411
Put my foot in my mouth again but...

525
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:42,786
I heard that you might be
looking for work,

526
00:46:42,836 --> 00:46:48,120
and I could actually use a lot
of help down at the feed store.

527
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,995
Well that's very kind of you Shelly,
but I will find something somewhere.

528
00:46:52,045 --> 00:46:53,745
Well I'm not asking to be kind.

529
00:46:53,795 --> 00:46:56,578
I could really use the help.

530
00:46:56,628 --> 00:47:00,786
So, think about it.

531
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:05,578
I will.

532
00:47:05,628 --> 00:47:10,328
Ok.

533
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,855
What the hell are you doing seeing him?

534
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:24,745
How did you know?

535
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:29,245
It's a small town Pam,
haven't you noticed.

536
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:31,495
News travels fast.

537
00:47:31,545 --> 00:47:37,036
You know not only is he an ex
con, but he's your ex husband.

538
00:47:37,086 --> 00:47:41,745
I mean what did you think
you'd accomplish by seeing him?

539
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:44,786
I don't know.

540
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:48,411
You don't know?

541
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:52,370
What kind of answer is that?

542
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,036
You still have feelings for him,
is that what this is?

543
00:47:56,086 --> 00:48:03,161
How dare you say that to me.

544
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:06,328
Well why'd you go see him?

545
00:48:06,378 --> 00:48:10,870
You know why I saw him.

546
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,328
Well, why didn't you tell me?

547
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:14,870
I saw him for Christopher.

548
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,786
I'm Christopher's father, you don't talk
to anyone about my son unless I know.

549
00:48:18,836 --> 00:48:22,286
Do you really think that this is
something we could keep from Eden?

550
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:25,703
Scratch Eden, I was a father to
that kid for 8 years.

551
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:28,328
I know, I'm not denying that.

552
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:32,370
But you and I both know you've
always wanted something back.

553
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,245
I mean he doesn't even call
you Dad for heavens sake,

554
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:39,328
is that a little boys fault?

555
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:43,328
You hardly touch him, you never
tell him that you love him.

556
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,953
I understand that he didn't
come from you...

557
00:48:45,003 --> 00:48:47,578
Ok.

558
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:49,745
You made your point.

I got it.

561
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:04,661
There’s no sense in making a big
deal out of this.

562
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:08,620
You know, I doubt Eden will want
anything to do with him anyway.

563
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:11,953
Well, what if he does?

564
00:49:12,003 --> 00:49:13,911
How are we going to include Eden
into our lives?

565
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:15,828
I don't know.

00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:17,245
I mean how is that going to work?

567
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:20,370
I don't know, I thought we
would just figure it out!

568
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,036
Oh we'd just figure it out?

569
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:29,495
You think the world works like that?

570
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:33,370
I don't want you to see him anymore.

type of garbage in his life.

for Christopher.

low profile.

I wanted to ask you if you don't mind.

I wrote while I was locked up.

just take a look at them,

me one thing...

Whats that?

701
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:32,045

out of here, and you will...

You do your best to leave it behind ya.

to eat you up,

and you ain’t going to be no good
for nobody.

705
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:49,628
Remember that time I took you
hunting, you were in high school,

706
00:58:49,678 --> 00:58:51,962
and we went up to hells canyon?

Yea.

708
00:58:53,053 --> 00:59:01,053
You shot a buck, and I went on
ahead to find that deer I wounded.

709
00:59:01,262 --> 00:59:06,837
I told you to follow that ridge all the
way back and you'd get to the camp.

710
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:11,462
You remember that?

711
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:12,795
Yea, how could I forget.

712
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:17,337
Well you knew better, you went off down
through that canyon darn near killed ya.

713
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:25,387
Found you the next day scared, beat silly.

714
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:32,492

kill me than you surely would.

715
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:35,156

did that night.

Well, I'm going to tell you
now what I told you then.

720
00:59:57,512 --> 01:00:02,170
You get on top of that ridge and
you follow it right out of here.

And you try real hard to find
something real good in all this mess,

722

and more importantly...

723
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:18,212
the good in yourself.

724
01:00:18,262 --> 01:00:21,795
I couldn't do that myself.

01:00:21,845 --> 01:00:24,378
What do you mean, you did fine.

726
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:28,087
I didn't do fine.

727
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:31,587
I wasted a lot of precious time.

728
01:00:31,637 --> 01:00:37,878
I lost sight in what was
important in life.

729
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:40,878
Huh.

730
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:48,928
But the time has passed now and I
don't have time to think about that.

731
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,878
Anymore.

732
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:59,928
But you can...

733
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:10,378
Dad, you're talking like you're not
going to see me when I get out of here.

734
01:01:10,428 --> 01:01:15,878
Eden my health hasn't been so good lately.

735
01:01:15,928 --> 01:01:23,212
Doctors think I should go down
to Salt Lake for more testing,

736
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:26,795
but it don't look good.

737
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:29,878
What?

738
01:01:29,928 --> 01:01:35,003
What are you talking about?

739
01:01:35,053 --> 01:01:36,587
No.

740
01:01:36,637 --> 01:01:37,753
No.

741
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:43,462
You'll be fine, Dad you are as
strong as an ox.

742
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:48,712
This old ox is on its last legs.

743
01:01:48,762 --> 01:01:54,212
No don't say that you are a
fighter, you got to fight this.

744
01:01:54,262 --> 01:02:00,087
Visiting hours are over, wrap it up.

745
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:00,737
-Music-

746
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,712
Hey.

747
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:02,337
Don't you have people to do that?

748
01:05:02,387 --> 01:05:04,795
You'd be surprised how hard it
is to find good help these days.

749
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,337
Is that right?

750
01:05:06,387 --> 01:05:08,556
If you know anybody with a strong back who

751
01:05:08,586 --> 01:05:10,837
likes long hours and
hard work let me know.

752
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:14,087
Well you know what, I might know
just the guy.

753
01:05:14,137 --> 01:05:14,737
-Music-

754
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:22,170
Hey Shelly.

755
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,545
Hey.

756
01:06:24,595 --> 01:06:25,712
How was your day?

757
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:27,628
It was good.

758
01:06:27,678 --> 01:06:31,837
Feels good to work, ya know?

759
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,587
Listen I uh..

760
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:38,462
I want to thank you for giving
me this job.

761
01:06:38,512 --> 01:06:42,503
Like I said I really needed the help.

762
01:06:42,553 --> 01:06:46,503
I know, but not everyone in this
town would give me that chance.

763
01:06:46,553 --> 01:06:50,587
I never really was too concerned
about what other people think.

764
01:06:50,637 --> 01:06:53,670
You know you might take some heat for it.

765
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,795
Ill deal with it.

766
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,712
Ok.

767
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:03,170
So how did you end up in this
one horse town anyway?

768
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:09,003
Well, that’s kind of a long story.

769
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:12,587
You really want to know?

770
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,795
I was living in Salt Lake.

771
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:15,920
And...

772
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,378
I decided that I needed to make a change,

773
01:07:18,428 --> 01:07:23,837
and I took off one morning to visit a
friend in Boise and I made a wrong turn,

774
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:29,128
and I ended up here.

775
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,837
I thought you said it was a long story?

776
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:34,295
Well...

777
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:35,545
I gave you the short version.

778
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:38,920
I see.

779
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,920
But it um..

780
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:42,337
It just felt right.

781
01:07:42,387 --> 01:07:44,587
Ya know?

782
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:48,420
And hey with a name like Soda
Springs I thought...

783
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:52,128
It must be a pretty good place to live.

784
01:07:52,178 --> 01:07:54,670
Hm, so much for your woman's intuition.

785
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,128
It's not that bad.

786
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:00,337
You know I've actually grown
to love it here.

787
01:08:00,387 --> 01:08:04,920
Well, what made you want to
leave Salt Lake?

788
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:07,337
Typical story.

789
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:10,795
My husband decided that he
needed the younger version.

790
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:13,003
I won't bore you with those details.

791
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:15,753
I'm sorry about that.

792
01:08:15,803 --> 01:08:17,920
Ok.

793
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:22,795
It was difficult for a while,
but I'm getting there.

794
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:26,087
That's good.

795
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:28,003
What about you?

796
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:30,628
Whats it like being back home?

797
01:08:30,678 --> 01:08:32,628
It's different.

798
01:08:32,678 --> 01:08:36,087
I bet.

799
01:08:36,137 --> 01:08:40,337
You know why I went away don't you?

800
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:42,170
It's a small town.

801
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:45,837
Yea.

802
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:47,753
And you're ok with it?

803
01:08:47,803 --> 01:08:51,753
I gave you a job didn't I?

804
01:08:51,803 --> 01:08:55,003
Yes you did, and I appreciate it.

805
01:08:55,053 --> 01:08:57,837
Well it was my pleasure.

806
01:08:57,887 --> 01:08:58,545
See you tomorrow.

807
01:08:58,595 --> 01:09:00,212
Yea.

808
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:04,628
And you know for what it's
worth, your ex husband...

809
01:09:04,678 --> 01:09:08,962
He should have his head examined.

810
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:11,795
Goodnight.

811
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:15,795
Goodnight.

812
01:09:24,228 --> 01:09:25,512
Alright is that going to do it?

813
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:26,428
That'll do it.

814
01:09:26,478 --> 01:09:27,470
Ok.

815
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,262
I think you're going to be
happy with this one.

816
01:09:30,312 --> 01:09:34,262
That is $31.79.

817
01:09:34,312 --> 01:09:35,178
32...

818
01:09:35,228 --> 01:09:37,470
Ok out of 32.

819
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,887
Alright Kirk, 21 cents is your change.

820
01:09:39,937 --> 01:09:40,762
You take care.

821
01:09:40,812 --> 01:09:42,512
Thank you, say hi to your mother too.

822
01:09:42,562 --> 01:09:49,887
I'll do that.

823
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:54,470
Hi Eden, how are you?

824
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,262
I'm ok.

825
01:09:57,312 --> 01:09:58,720
You?

826
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,595
I'm good.

827
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:02,470
Heard you were working here.

828
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,887
Yea.

829
01:10:03,937 --> 01:10:10,970
Got to pay the bills.

830
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,845
These your kids?

831
01:10:11,895 --> 01:10:14,220
Yea these are them.

832
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:17,553
I’ve got my hands full.

833
01:10:17,603 --> 01:10:18,428
They are cute kids.

834
01:10:18,478 --> 01:10:22,012
Thanks.

835
01:10:22,062 --> 01:10:24,345
Uh...

836
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:26,220
That's um..

837
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:30,137
That's $16.95 please.

838
01:10:30,187 --> 01:10:33,303
20?

839
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:40,053
5 makes 17, 18, 19 and 20.

840
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:41,845
It's good to see you.

841
01:10:41,895 --> 01:10:44,845
Good to see you.

842
01:10:44,895 --> 01:10:46,137
Take care.

843
01:10:46,187 --> 01:10:46,787
I will.

844
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,648
Hello?

845
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:02,262
Hello there.

846
01:11:02,312 --> 01:11:04,387
How are you ladies today?

847
01:11:04,437 --> 01:11:08,428
Ok is that going to be it?

848
01:11:23,728 --> 01:11:28,512
Eden Jackson, working for a living.

849
01:11:28,562 --> 01:11:31,887
Got to admit, looks pretty good on you.

850
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:34,720
Well thank you.

851
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:37,887
Listen Eden...

852
01:11:37,937 --> 01:11:41,637
I just want you to know that when I
came by your house the other day...

853
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:45,220
I had every intention telling
you about your son.

854
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:49,887
Look I know this is a whole lot
for you to take right now but...

855
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:57,937
I was wondering if maybe you'd
want to meet Christopher?

856
01:12:02,687 --> 01:12:06,512
Why don't you just come over and say hi?

857
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:14,562
He's here now?

858
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,595
I don't know Pam.

859
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:20,428
Look Eden I'm not trying to
put you on the spot,

860
01:12:20,478 --> 01:12:28,478
but Larry is at work and it could be a
good time for you to at least meet him.

861
01:12:30,437 --> 01:12:34,595
What do I say?

862
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:38,095
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

863
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,720
Come on.

864
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:07,637
Hey Chris honey...

865
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:13,928
I want you to meet somebody.

866
01:13:16,228 --> 01:13:18,095
Hi Mr. Eden.

867
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:19,845
Hi Chris, It's nice to meet you.

868
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,178
It's nice to meet you too.

869
01:13:22,228 --> 01:13:23,637
Is that your truck.

870
01:13:23,687 --> 01:13:26,220
Yea that's my truck.

871
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,553
It could use a coat a paint couldn't it?

872
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,012
I like it.

873
01:13:29,062 --> 01:13:34,178
Well thank you.

874
01:13:34,228 --> 01:13:36,803
You know I saw you play in a
baseball game the other day.

875
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:37,637
Really?

876
01:13:37,687 --> 01:13:39,470
Yea.

877
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,095
You are really good.

878
01:13:41,145 --> 01:13:43,762
I've hit 6 home runs so far.

879
01:13:43,812 --> 01:13:46,720
6 home runs?

880
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,387
That is incredible.

881
01:13:48,437 --> 01:13:51,387
Do you play baseball?

882
01:13:51,437 --> 01:13:53,345
You know I used to.

883
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:54,887
A long time ago.

884
01:13:54,937 --> 01:13:56,678
You know, I was a falcon just like you.

885
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:57,637
Really?

886
01:13:57,687 --> 01:13:59,262
Yea.

887
01:13:59,312 --> 01:14:01,470
Had a hat just like yours.

888
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,220
You did?

889
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,637
Yea.

890
01:14:03,687 --> 01:14:07,762
Only mine, it was all worn out
cause I never took it off.

891
01:14:07,812 --> 01:14:10,803
My mom thought it was
permanently attached to my head.

892
01:14:10,853 --> 01:14:16,137
I slept with mine on once.

893
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:20,387
Did you go to my school?

894
01:14:20,437 --> 01:14:21,137
Yea.

895
01:14:21,187 --> 01:14:22,553
Valleyview Elementary right?

896
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:23,595
Yea.

897
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:25,720
Do you still live here?

898
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:29,262
You know I just moved back.

899
01:14:29,312 --> 01:14:30,595
We got to get going ok.

900
01:14:30,645 --> 01:14:33,428
Why don't you say goodbye and
meet mommy in the car ok?

901
01:14:33,478 --> 01:14:36,220
Goodbye Mr. Eden.

902
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:44,270
Goodbye Chris.

903
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:46,095
Nice to meet you Chris.

904
01:14:46,145 --> 01:14:51,484
Nice to meet you too.

905
01:14:55,478 --> 01:14:57,220
You ok?

906
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:00,428
Yea.

907
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:05,095
I just really wanted you to meet him.

908
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:08,137
Thank you.

909
01:15:08,187 --> 01:15:13,387
You did good Eden.

910
01:16:11,478 --> 01:16:18,720
Look what I found.

913
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,103
Hey Eden.

914
01:16:57,164 --> 01:16:58,870
Hey.

915
01:16:59,665 --> 01:17:01,699
How was the day?

916
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:03,365
Not bad.

917
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:08,532
That's good.

918
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,740
So um, was there something you
wanted to ask me?

919
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:15,032
Why would you think that?

920
01:17:15,082 --> 01:17:21,407
I don't know because you're
acting strange.

921
01:17:21,457 --> 01:17:23,324
Well you know...

922
01:17:23,374 --> 01:17:28,324
I was wondering uh, I know you
like to ride,

923
01:17:28,374 --> 01:17:30,615
and I just thought...

924
01:17:30,665 --> 01:17:33,449
You know, I know some good
places just outside of town.

925
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:36,907
Maybe we can take off one of
these days and ride.

926
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,324
I would like that.

927
01:17:38,374 --> 01:17:40,990
Very much.

928
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,032
Great.

929
01:17:43,082 --> 01:17:44,699
Uhh, how about Sunday?

930
01:17:44,749 --> 01:17:48,282
Sunday would be perfect.

931
01:17:48,332 --> 01:17:50,615
Alright, great.

932
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:51,407
Goodnight.

933
01:17:51,457 --> 01:17:56,032
Goodnight.

935
01:19:01,332 --> 01:19:03,240
I like this.

936
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,990
What's that?

937
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:12,907
Being here... with you.

938
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,424
I agree.

940

941
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:11,574
What do you want?

942
01:20:11,624 --> 01:20:13,657
I'd just like to talk to you for a minute.

943
01:20:13,707 --> 01:20:16,365
I ain’t got nothing to say to you.

944
01:20:16,415 --> 01:20:18,699
I thought we might be able to
work this out man to man.

945
01:20:18,749 --> 01:20:20,407
Listen.

946
01:20:20,457 --> 01:20:22,157
There ain’t nothing to work out here.

947
01:20:22,207 --> 01:20:24,657
I told you to stay away from my family.

948
01:20:24,707 --> 01:20:26,449
That’s all you need to know.

949
01:20:26,499 --> 01:20:29,157
I don't want to get in the way
of you and your family, I'd just...

950
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:32,240
I'd like a chance to come and see
Chris once in a while and maybe...

951
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,657
Take him to a game or...

952
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:37,490
You just don't get it do you,
you know what...

953
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:41,199
Call the cops and tell them to
come down here.

954
01:20:41,249 --> 01:20:42,824
Yea.

955
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:46,240
What?

956
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,407
What?

957
01:20:48,457 --> 01:20:52,282
Well that's right get back in
that fancy truck of yours.

958
01:20:52,332 --> 01:20:56,574
Run back to mommy, she'll protect you.

959
01:21:28,165 --> 01:21:29,907
Didn't go so well?

960
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:33,157
What's it matter anyway, I'm
not cut out to be a Dad.

961
01:21:33,207 --> 01:21:35,157
Who says?

962
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:38,115
I say.

963
01:21:38,165 --> 01:21:38,990
Eden...

964
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,324
Shelly look..

965
01:21:41,374 --> 01:21:44,490
I appreciate everything I really do,

966
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,264
but what do I have to offer this kid huh?

967
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:47,907
He's better off right where he is.

968
01:21:47,957 --> 01:21:49,740
Come on you really think that?

969
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:51,365
Yea.

970
01:21:51,415 --> 01:21:52,946
I probably just screw him up anyway,

971
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:57,091
and then he'd just be another
one in a long line of screw ups.

972
01:21:58,183 --> 01:22:06,183
So why don't you be the one to
change things?

973
01:22:21,624 --> 01:22:26,782
Look Eden I don't know what
you're afraid of.

974
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:29,054
But I really think that
Christopher would be

975
01:22:29,084 --> 01:22:31,284
a lucky boy to have
you a part of his life.

976

-Music-

977
01:23:29,374 --> 01:23:32,240
You think this is a good idea?

978
01:23:32,528 --> 01:23:35,353
Probably not.

979
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,336
Larry at work?

980
01:23:36,397 --> 01:23:38,135
Yea.

981
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:43,119
He's going to have to come to
terms with it somehow right.

982
01:23:46,472 --> 01:23:52,006
Chris knows your his dad.

983
01:23:52,056 --> 01:23:54,631
Did you tell him?

984
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:57,131
He just figured it out on his own.

985
01:23:57,181 --> 01:24:02,381
Kids just pick up on things.

986
01:24:02,431 --> 01:24:04,089
How does he feel about it?

987
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,172
He hasn't said anything, but...

988
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:07,756
I know my kid.

989
01:24:07,806 --> 01:24:13,797
He's thrilled.

990
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:16,339
I just don't know why you didn't
say something to me before...

991
01:24:16,389 --> 01:24:20,589
Eden, it would have only made
things worse for you.

992
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:27,670
I honestly thought that I was doing
the right thing by not telling you.

993
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:29,733
Larry's not going to like this one bit.

994
01:24:29,924 --> 01:24:31,060
I know.

995
01:24:36,056 --> 01:24:37,589
Of all the people you could've
gotten involved with...

996
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:43,214
Eden, just stop. Don't start.

997
01:24:43,264 --> 01:24:48,797
He was there for us when you
weren't, like it or not.

998
01:24:48,847 --> 01:24:51,006
How does he treat Chris?

999
01:24:51,056 --> 01:24:53,214
He's fine.

1000
01:24:53,264 --> 01:24:55,797
He tried, ya know?

1001
01:24:55,847 --> 01:25:00,381
He's never been mean to him or
anything but...

1002
01:25:00,431 --> 01:25:03,089
There was just something missing.

1003
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:04,506
It's hard to explain.

1004
01:25:04,556 --> 01:25:09,089
As a mom, it kind of breaks your
heart sometimes.

1005
01:25:09,139 --> 01:25:11,922
What about you?

1006
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:16,964
Are you happy?

1007
01:25:17,014 --> 01:25:22,089
Depends what you define as being happy.

1008
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:23,047
For the most part yea.

1009
01:25:23,097 --> 01:25:26,672
I guess I'm happy.

1010
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,381
But there is always that one
part of me that will wonder

1011
01:25:29,431 --> 01:25:35,089
what things would of been like, ya know?

1012
01:25:35,139 --> 01:25:39,006
Yea.

1013
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:43,464
Hey Mr. Eden, can you come hit
us some ground balls please?

1014
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,547
Yea Mr. Eden can you come help me
out and hit some ground balls please,

1015
01:25:46,597 --> 01:25:54,589
I'd sure appreciate it.

1016
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,172
We'll always have a bond.

1017
01:25:58,222 --> 01:26:00,164

01:28:08,556 --> 01:28:10,214
Ahh, I sing that good.

Well this stupid piece of junk
won't start.

1051
01:29:05,867 --> 01:29:06,942

reputation around here.

to party with.

1067

That was a long time ago.

1068
01:30:05,284 --> 01:30:07,025
Don't give me that.

1069
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:09,650
I'm sure you still have it in you.

1070
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:13,650

You keep driving through town,

1074

flirting, much more.

1075
