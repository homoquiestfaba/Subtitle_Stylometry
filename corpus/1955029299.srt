1
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:30,510
Death.

2
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:46,486
That's how life is.

3
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:17,906
Good morning lady.

4
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,125
I have a terrible toothache!
I need the dentist immediately!

5
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:23,236
Did you call for an appointment?

6
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,976
I have no phone.

7
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,906
Well, then,
You must wait.

8
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,825
Wait?
My lady, please!

9
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,046
There is a vacancy
in two hours.

10
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,885
My Lady! It's not possible
to expect me...

11
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,245
... to endure this
horrible pain for two hours!

12
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,075
Very well. I'll wait.

13
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,325
And let's hope I don't
fall apart from the agony!

14
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,435
Good morning sir. You are well?

15
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,445
And I'm happy to meet you too!

16
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:56,426
My son, the circus clown...

17
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,556
What are you doing on my rigging?

18
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,575
Get down from there!

19
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:26,105
Get down from my rigging!

20
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:29,355
You want to kill yourself? You idiot!

21
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,996
Faster!

22
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,575
Otherwise I will climb up
and throw you off!

23
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,466
Philippe!

24
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,886
Can you hear me?

25
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,906
Yes I can, but I don't speak Czech.

26
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:26,008
Sorry, I will speak English.

27
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:19,166
You will never become anything
from doing stupid circus tricks!

28
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:21,886
Walking on a wire will not
put bread on your table!

29
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,115
- Edmond, you need to reconsider!
Give him a chance!

30
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:25,536
No!
His carrots are cooked!

31
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,965
Exactly!

32
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,085
Carrots cooked!

33
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,685
You know, I was doing fine
until you came along!

34
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,315
Are you proud
of yourself?

35
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,735
Since when do mimes speak?

36
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,835
No. I am not a mime. Nor do I
hide behind an imaginary wall!

37
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:49,465
Please do not offend my circle.
It is a sacred place.

38
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,806
You are a thief!

39
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,476
Who do you think you are, stupid?

40
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,269
Do you mind if
I take a few photos?

41
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,776
- Why?

42
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,006
I am Philippe.

43
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:56,630
Hello. Jean-Louis.

44
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,925
You need to know how to knock!

45
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:47,573
It's completely ridiculous!

46
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:18,435
- You're crazy!
Yes, I'm totally crazy!

47
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:20,008
Completely!
- Yes, but that's why I love you!

48
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:03,000
Philippe, you should hear yourselves.
Both of you are behaving like children!

49
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,551
Okay, Jeff.
Welcome to 'the crime'.

50
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:11,605
You will make a great accomplice!

51
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:15,789
Exactly. 110 floors.

52
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:18,198
That's how tall the towers are.

53
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:05,459
Hey Jeff, why are
you trembling?

54
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:07,709
I'm scared of heights.

55
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,059
There's no need to panic.

56
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:12,459
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

57
00:50:57,795 --> 00:50:59,195
This guy thinks we're stupid...

58
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:00,839
... he's trying to rip us off.

59
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:03,102
What's wrong with the walkie-talkie?

60
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,021
We need wired so the cops can't hear us.

61
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:09,859
Guys! If you're selling drugs, or...

62
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,776
robbing a bank,
less attention, right?

63
00:51:22,368 --> 00:51:24,639
I know fuck all about robbing a bank.

64
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:32,313
This is bad. I don't trust these idiots.

65
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:34,549
...especially Grumpy over there.

66
00:52:37,812 --> 00:52:39,582
Do you trust these guys?

67
00:52:39,632 --> 00:52:42,032
Trust them?
It's these two,

68
00:52:42,085 --> 00:52:43,301
or who else?

69
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:05,071
...have something to eat.

70
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:07,732
I don't want food!
I want to go over the plan!

71
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,301
...and find some more
skilled partners.

72
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,205
The carrots are cooked!

73
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:16,962
It's now or never, my friend.

74
00:54:20,832 --> 00:54:22,030
The carrots are cooked.

75
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:50,339
The carrots are cooked.

76
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:39,982
Be careful.

77
00:59:41,351 --> 00:59:42,471
I love you.

78
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,582
You hear that?
Did you hear that guy?
There's no way in today!

79
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:13,382
We have to stay here
and think of another way.

80
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:16,752
All right? Take a break.
Take a break.

81
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:37,152
When we reach the 110th floor...

82
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:39,172
invite this guy
downstairs for a drink.

83
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:41,201
He has to be
hungry or thirsty.

84
01:03:41,201 --> 01:03:42,814
- <i>That'll be difficult.</i>

85
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:44,467
<i>I need him out of here!</i>

86
01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:46,658
<i>I don't want to be disturbed!</i>

87
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:09,039
How long were we under there?

88
01:11:13,497 --> 01:11:14,952
Three and a half hours.

89
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,401
What's he doing?

90
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:50,932
A little nap maybe?

91
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:24,030
I don't believe it!
Go watch the guard.
And be quiet!

92
01:13:17,078 --> 01:13:18,859
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

93
01:13:27,082 --> 01:13:28,082
Did you find it?

94
01:13:28,849 --> 01:13:30,193
No! Watch the guard!

95
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:03,348
Look, the guard has gone.

96
01:16:12,262 --> 01:16:13,682
This is very special to me.

97
01:17:52,052 --> 01:17:53,752
You think he's gone?

98
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:12,922
You know what they say?
It's just you and me, my friend.

99
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,981
Hey! The wheel!

100
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,474
Quick, come with me!

101
01:23:13,082 --> 01:23:14,882
We need to go down here
and tighten these guide ropes!

102
01:23:15,395 --> 01:23:18,102
It's too high! I can't do it!
It's too dangerous!

103
01:23:18,151 --> 01:23:20,332
We need to tighten the carabinas!
- <i>I'm scared out of my mind!</i>

104
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:22,392
Philippe, I can't do it!

105
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:25,462
Jeff, my friend?
Listen!

106
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:27,187
You need to climb down
or we just worked for nothing!

107
01:23:29,012 --> 01:23:31,311
Yes, you can!
You can do it!

108
01:23:31,728 --> 01:23:34,161
Here, I'll help you!

109
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,521
I'm just going to fix the
other one over there, okay?

110
01:23:55,642 --> 01:23:57,682
- <i>Don't leave me here by myself!</i>

111
01:24:20,031 --> 01:24:21,521
You did well, thank you.

112
01:26:19,031 --> 01:26:20,981
What are you going to do with that?

113
01:26:21,065 --> 01:26:21,975
What?

114
01:27:41,462 --> 01:27:44,332
I lost my costume! I cannot perform without it!

115
01:44:06,634 --> 01:44:08,525
You've got to come in!

116
01:44:08,941 --> 01:44:10,664
- <i>You've made your point!</i>

117
01:44:15,492 --> 01:44:17,672
Please come in now! It's over!

118
01:44:18,378 --> 01:44:19,733
You've done it!

119
01:44:25,722 --> 01:44:29,722
Please! You need to come in!
It's over! It's not worth it!

120
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:43,111
Wait, wait.

121
01:52:46,142 --> 01:52:47,382
Are you sure?

122
01:52:47,981 --> 01:52:49,336
Yes, sure.

123
01:53:00,862 --> 01:53:02,209
Bye now.

124
01:53:08,082 --> 01:53:09,496
Goodbye.
