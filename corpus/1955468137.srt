(helicopter whirring)

3
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:26,772
Bring in the team.

4
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:33,338
(hawk screeches)

5
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:38,931
They're coming out, with the ambassador.

6
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,586
Crunch, get the escort in sight.

7
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:55,684
They're getting close.

8
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:56,517
Hang on.

9
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:57,757
We got to go!

10
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,590
Hold!

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,452
This is it, man.

12
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:05,410
[Aldo] There's no more time.

13
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,573
They're at the cars.

14
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,028
Hold.

15
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:09,028
Easy, son.

16
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,683
[Aldo] Damn it, I need to go!

17
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:13,516
Go, go!

18
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:14,349
[Aldo] Go!

19
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,736

(men grunting)

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,339
Stop them!

23
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,988
(moves to somber music)

24
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:58,020
(muffled gunfire)

25
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,245
Papa!

26
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,300
Papa!

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Pa, wake up!

28
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,746
Papa! Papa!

29
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,508
Papa, Papa.

30
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:32,008
Don't die, please!

Cookies?

36
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,840
Aldo, it's been over a year.

00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:28,743
Beep.

43
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:32,326
Jaz, you don't have
an answering machine.

44
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,049
Hey, darlin' how ya doin'?

45
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,369
I didn't know it was you.

46
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,104
I'm, (exhales) well,

47
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,790
right in the middle of
a really big workout.

48
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,623
What's up?

49
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,203
Would you like me to call back?

50
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,206
No, no, it's cool.

51
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:45,587
What's goin' on?

52
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,587
It's Aldo.

53
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,900
I'll be right there.

54

(heavy breathing)

57
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:24,783
What's the matter, Sparky?

58
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:28,665
You couldn't get a seat in the front row?

59
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:29,498
Look.

60
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,160
I know why you're here.

61
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:36,802
You gotta let it go, Aldo.

62
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,025
It was my fault.

63
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,084
It wasn't your fault.

64
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,763
It wasn't anybody's fault.

65
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:47,570
I was in command, remember?

66
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,813
Yeah, you were in command,

67
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:52,418
you gave the order, but it was a mission.

68
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,168
We all knew the risks,
including your father.

69
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,575
I didn't even react.

70
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:01,242
I let the car go by.

71
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:04,703
You, let the car go by.

72
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,370
You were there all
alone, I wasn't with you?

73
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:12,282
You think I don't have nightmares?

74
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:15,865
You think I don't feel
like I let you down?

75
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:17,955
I do.

76
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:24,187
Look.

77
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:25,979
Aldo.

78
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,109
You gotta move forward.

79
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,305
Move on in life, Aldo.

80
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:36,412
You got a beautiful wife,
a wonderful daughter.

81
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:37,711
Think of the positive things.

82
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:40,794
The work you're doing for the school.

83
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,420
You gonna be all right?

84
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,126
I'm fine.

85
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,043
See you in the morning.

86
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,113
Hey, Sparky.

87
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,208
You know, I, uh...

88
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,331
Like a brother, I mean.

89
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,148
I know.

90
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:21,104
[Jaz] Whoa, whoa, ah.

91
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,651
Whoa, ah, ah.

92
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,068
I don't care if they
did annex the security.

93
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:34,080
The subbasement is the perfect target.

94
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,915
Those chemical weapons better be ready.

95
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,675
I don't want anymore delays.

96
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,425
(dramatic music)

97
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,573
(coughing heavily)

98
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:58,625
I'm fine.

99
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,616
It's Drey.

100
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,797
What?

101
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:13,047
He wants to know our ETA.

102
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,674
(phone rings)

103
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,384
Drey?

104
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,374
Say again.

105
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,218
In about 10 minutes.

106
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,577
All right.

107
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:33,910
All right, fine.

108
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:48,563
(explosion rumbles)

109
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:04,483
(helicopter whirring distantly)

110
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:07,150
(ominous music)

111
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:45,816
How'd it go?

112
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:49,367
They've added extra
security at the sub base.

113
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,972
A few new dignitaries must've
been added to the guest list.

114
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:53,109
American, I hope.

115
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,454
Among others.

116
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,152
You get Carlos on it.

117
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:58,262
I don't want anything to screw up.

118
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,451
How far away are we?

119
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,046
Don't worry, we'll be ready.

120
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,343
Don't worry?

121
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,463
We're on a timeframe.

122
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,457
What's so difficult about
building a chemical weapon?

123
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,180
Third-world nations do it all the time.

124
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,430
(coughing)

125
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:14,558
Jesus Christ, are you all right?

126
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,475
I'm fine.

127
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:19,195
Over 2,000 years ago,

128
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:22,533
a tribe of powerful men
lived all over the island.

129
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:26,366
These warriors dug caves
and mines everywhere.

130
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:31,323
It took them hundreds
and hundreds of years

131
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,001
to carve these tunnels out of solid rock.

132
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:38,996
It was difficult, and the
task was almost impossible,

133
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:42,820
but these warriors, with
the help of a great spirit,

134
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,092
they could do almost anything.

135
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:48,484
Legend has it, that a
special tribal council

136
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:52,651
would gather if any of the
elder was sick or near death.

137
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:57,690
For only they knew the secret
to unlock the magical potion.

138
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:05,397
The high priest would
take the holy chalice

139
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:08,810
and give thanks to the great spirit above.

140
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,727
(speaking in foreign language)

141
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,758
(ghostly whispers)

142
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:19,508
(dramatic music)

143
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:30,800
Then he would give the
elder the mystical medicine.

144
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:39,503
One drink from the sacred
cup, and the elder was healed.

145
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,583
(speaking foreign language)

146
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,837
Then one day, they just disappeared.

147
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,087
(rumbling)

148
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,877
(men screaming)

149
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:03,649
No one knows what happened.

150
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,781
Some say the warriors protect

151
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:08,494
the cup from ever being found.

152
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,537
And if you listen carefully,

153
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:13,704
you can hear the whispers in the wind.

154
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:16,867
Papa?

155
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,038
Can you see them?

156
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:21,788
You can if you close your eyes.

157
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:26,019
You can sense them all around you.

158
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,192
(explosion roars)

159
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,778
Ooh, is that them, Papa?

160
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,885
(laughing)
Maybe, maybe.

161
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:36,205
(school bell ringing)
(laughing)

162
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,038
You're funny, Papa.

163
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:42,981
What's more important is that

164
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,011
we're still digging in section seven.

165
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,374
Yeah, but maybe being in the mines

166
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:47,980
isn't so good for you right now.

167
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,813
Now?

168
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:49,707
Now is all I've got.

169
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,475
I've gotta find that ancient medicine.

170
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,577
How many times I gotta tell
you my life depends on it?

171
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:54,771
I know, Dad, I'm just saying.

172
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,938
Look, just keep digging.

173
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,719
We did have another accident.

174
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,552
What?

175
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:01,736
Two dead.

176
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,213
How the hell do you know that?

177
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,908
I'm in tune.

178
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,118
In tune, my ass.

179
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:07,680
You're a psychic sideshow circus freak,

180
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,958
who belongs in a fuckin' zoo...

181
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,634
All right, enough, enough.

182
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,801
What happened?

183
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:14,948
They fell down a mineshaft.

184
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,334
Nobody can figure it out.

185
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,654
Any of our people?

186
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,462
No, just some locals.

187
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:20,824
Some of 'em are getting spooked though.

188
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:24,071
They say they're starting to see things.

189
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,217
Let's just forget about it.

190
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:29,550
(coughs) Where's Braga?

191
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:37,159
Ancient fucking medicine, my ass.

192
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,755
(somber orchestral music)

193
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,913
I've spoken with Luigi.

194
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:46,366
The lease was up and an offer was made.

195
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,866
They're gonna lose the school.

196
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:51,865
The mining company?

197
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:57,442
What they want with this property anyway?

198
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,692
I don't know.

199
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:02,717
Talk to Luigi, Aldo.

200
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,440
Maybe there is something you can do.

201
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,054
It's no use.

202
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:06,887
Try.

203
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:11,511
Why should he listen to me?

204
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,953
He respected your father.

205
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,837
As you can see from this last test,

206
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,573
we've had a bit of a mixed result,

207
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:22,932
but with the addition of palladium,

208
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,079
which should be arriving
in the next few days,

209
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,749
I should be able to up
the potency by a good 30%.

210
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,469
But of course, the mice
are just the first phase.

211
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:33,469
No, look, look, just make it work.

212
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,203
Look, I reexamined the map.

213
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,873
I think we're digging in the wrong place.

214
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:44,091
Now, I don't have much time.

215
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:45,989
I gotta find that tomb.

216
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:47,306
Where do you wanna dig now?

217
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,065
I want you to hire more men.

218
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,232
Work 'em around the clock.

219
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:01,502
(ghostly whispers)

220
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,949
What's our actual timeframe?

221
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,003
Well, that depends.

222
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,211
Listen to me.

223
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,106
I got one sick fuck of
a delusional father,

224
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:22,732
who thinks he's gonna be healed
by some bullshit holy grail,

225
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,448
wasting my time in this
goddamn hole in the wall.

226
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,251
I don't wanna hear that depends.

227
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,577
Now, what's our actual timeframe?

228
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:34,912
I'm going to need at least three weeks.

229
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,930
Well, you got two.

230
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,243
No, no, no, no, no, no.

231
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:42,114
You don't understand, it's
not as simple as that.

232
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,670
I can't just snap my fingers and poof,

233
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,686
whip up some magical killing
potion out of thin air.

234
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:50,255
I need time, not to mention the fact

235
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:52,088
that you haven't exactly equipped me

236
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,336
with a state-of-the-art facility here.

237
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,942
I mean, look at this place.

238
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,629
I can't work like this, in this dark,

239
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:00,099
disgusting, subterranean hell.

240
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,788
I mean, it's cold, it's damp,

241
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,138
I can barely breathe,
I feel claustrophobic,

242
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,024
and you've handed me these
blithering, bloody idiots,

243
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:10,770
who barely speak English
and don't do a thing I say.

244
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,020
You finished?

245
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,601
Two weeks.

246
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,268
Now you got a week and a half.

247
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:39,465
[Anna] Dylan, time for dinner.

248
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:43,361
Let's go get you a treat. (Laughs)

249
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:47,028
(swelling orchestral music)

250
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,377
Papa, papa.

251
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,983
Papa!

252
00:17:57,983 --> 00:17:58,816
Papa?

253
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:00,501
Papa?

254
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:02,846
Papa?

255
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:05,321
Zorro threw up.

256
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:08,285
Okay, baby.

257
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:13,062
(moves to ominous music)

258
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,347
(ghostly whispers)

259
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,113
[Aldo] But you're the mayor, Luigi.

260
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,679
Can't you do something?

261
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:37,704
Sorry, Aldo.

262
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:39,845
You know I would'a blocked
it if I could have.

263
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:42,025
But after all, they're employing

264
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:44,490
a great number of people from our town,

265
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,553
which is helping our economy.

266
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,359
And as far as the school goes,

267
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,692
their offer has been more than generous.

268
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,133
Sorry.

269
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,590
Think about the kids.

270
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,771
What they want to do
with the school anyway?

271
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,252
It's not just the school.

272
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:11,389
They're buying the entire block.

273
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:12,997
It's a safety issue.

274
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,344
With all of the blasting that's going on,

275
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,849
all they want to do is
make sure the whole area

276
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:20,030
is safe and secure, that's all.

277
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,799
Well, pardon me there, Your Eminence,

278
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,448
but I was under the impression that

279
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:25,546
that mine was closed down because

280
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,192
they'd gotten everything
out of there already.

281
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:30,594
They have new technology,
they also have new equipment.

282
00:19:30,594 --> 00:19:32,531
There must be something we can do.

283
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,506
I'll tell ya what we can do.

284
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,398
I have to meet with them this afternoon.

285
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,378
Why don't you two come along?

286
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,211
Perfect.

287
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,479
And don't forget the parade tomorrow.

288
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,869
I happen to be the grand marshal.

289
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,036
I'm excited.

290
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:54,478
Gentlemen, if you follow me,

291
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:57,956
I think you'll find this interesting.

292
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:01,335
As you can see, we're mining
for numerous natural resources.

293
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:03,252
Iron ore, coal, silver.

294
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:07,191
We're going further and
deeper than anyone ever has.

295
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:08,673
With picks and shovels?

296
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:09,636
Well, yeah, we have to clear away

297
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,903
the debris from the blasting area.

298
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,705
Aren't you guys a little
bit concerned about cave-ins?

299
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:16,148
We've been doing this for a long time.

300
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,793
We know what we're doing.

301
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,430
Follow me.

302
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,930
(gloomy orchestral music)

303
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,205
[Aldo] No!

304
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,302
Sparky.

305
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:43,987
A lot of tunnels around here,

306
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:47,090
really easy to get lost, let's go.

307
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,805
You know, Drey, I've been thinking.

308
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:53,588
For all of my efforts I believe
I've been grossly underpaid.

309
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:54,421
Really?

310
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,465
If you wanna continue to
have the town's support,

311
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,361
we're gonna have to up the ante.

312
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,570
Say, an additional 100,000?

313
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,802
A hundred thousand.

314
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,635
Yeah.

315
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,408
All right, we'll take care of it.

316
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,681
I thought so.

317
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,931
Have a good day, gentlemen.

318
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,350
Take care of it.

319
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:42,914
(moves to festive music)

320
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,333
(Dylan laughing)

321
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,909
(screaming)

322
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:34,683
[Mayor's Wife] Luigi, Luigi!

323
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:37,622
(shouting in foreign language)

324
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,289
Luigi, Luigi, Luigi.

325
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:42,525
[Woman] Hey, attento!

326
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:46,923
(exciting dramatic music)

327
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:13,273
(speaking in foreign language)

328
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,633
(grunts)

329
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:55,949
(gunfire)

330
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:08,579
(church bell chiming)

331
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:20,959
(dramatic music)

332
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:43,384
Hey, man, what's going on?

333
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,534
It was him!

334
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:47,644
I know it was him!

335
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:50,199
I'm telling you, no one run through here.

336
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,040
I don't care what he said.

337
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,957
It was him!

338
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,067
That lying sonofabitch.

339
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:02,340
Where?

340
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:04,730
Where?

341
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,212
Where is it?

342
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:08,562
It's gotta be here.

343
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:10,704
I know it, I know it's here.

344
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:12,121
I know it's here.

345
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:17,527
I'm never gonna find it, it's useless.

346
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,365
What makes me think I'm any
different from all the people

347
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:21,299
who've gone through
miles and miles of rock?

348
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,648
And you, what the hell did I hire you for?

349
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,910
You're supposed to help me
find where I'm supposed to dig,

350
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,791
and all you do is this useless bullshit,

351
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,685
that don't mean shit to me.

352
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:34,596
You're worthless, and I don't have time...

353
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:35,429
There.

354
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:53,883
(exciting music)

355
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:47,891
I'm telling you, this guys
wasn't just a local with a gun.

356
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:49,200
He knew what he was doing.

357
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,158
Then who was he?

358
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:51,353
I don't know, Italian Special Forces,

359
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:52,657
CIA, I don't know.

360
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:57,144
Well, I think it might
be wise to find out.

361
00:27:57,144 --> 00:28:01,311
I don't want anything to
jeopardize my operation, you know.

362
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,196
(ghostly whispers)

363
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:24,085
Oh, and by the way, taking out the mayor

364
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:28,252
in front of the town, now
that was a stroke of genius.

365
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:35,807
You said take care of
it, I took care of it.

366
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:37,891
He is here.

367
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:41,910
(people coughing)

368
00:28:58,227 --> 00:29:00,644
(door slams)

369
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,753
Hello.

370
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,836
Drop the gun.

371
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:21,978
Found him, sector seven, level five.

372
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:26,543
Hold him at the elevator.

373
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:27,460
Let's go.

374
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,029
I'm on it.

375
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:44,379
(ghostly whispers)

376
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,676
(grunting)

377
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:54,929
You, idiots, secure the elevator.

378
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:56,247
Wait, you stay with me.

379
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,026
Go, go, come on.

380
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,782
(grunting shouts)

381
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,414
Milius.

382
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:03,959
Milius, do you copy?

383
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,138
Milius.

384
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,471
(grunting and shouting)

385
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,895
Milius, where are you?

386
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,437
(screams)

387
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,580
(splashes)

388
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,217
What just happened?

389
00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:38,518
I have no idea.

390
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:40,685
Well, you wanna get one?

391
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:47,839
So, what'd ya think it was?

392
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,098
Chemical compartments.

393
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,090
Some kind of medical experiment.

394
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,201
I need to find out more
about this operation.

395
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,147
How, I mean, you were
already in there once.

396
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:56,939
You had guys chasing
you around with AK-47s.

397
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,517
I mean, for all we know they could be

398
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,238
developing biochemical weapons.

399
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,497
I need to do this.

400
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:02,455
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:04,307
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

402
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:06,502
This isn't about the guy with the tattoo?

403
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,366
Hey, you don't even know if it was him.

404
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,785
It's him.

405
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,415
Let's just pull the team together.

406
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:14,049
No, I need a little more time.

407
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:18,446
His name is Aldo Paccione,
Italian Special Forces.

408
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:22,228
He served in Somalia, Kuwait and Albania.

409
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:26,238
His father was killed
in Operation Daybreak.

410
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:27,458
Really?

411
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,678
The one's name is
Jasper Harding, American.

412
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:34,205
Retired from Alpha Forces.

413
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:36,675
He was also at Operation Daybreak.

414
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:37,855
They're dangerous.

415
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,772
Yeah, very dangerous.

416
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:45,125
(gentle music)

417
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,333
(singing in foreign language)

418
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:10,589
(church bell chiming)

419
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,970
(exciting music)

420
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:34,472
The mayor was a good man.

421
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:43,449
How's Dylan?
Thank you.

422
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,264
Dylan, stop.

423
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,568
(screams)

424
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:56,501
(silencer whizzing)

425
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:59,418
(people screaming)

426
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:04,574
(gunfire)

427
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:15,119
(praying in foreign language)

428
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:18,989
Anna.

429
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:20,536
Anna.

430
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,369
Guardami.

431
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,410
Stai con me.

432
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:27,452
Stay awake, keep your eyes open!

433
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:29,885
Anna, Anna, don't close your eyes!

434
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,427
No, no!

435
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,590
Anna!

436
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,423
No!

437
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,308
(dramatic music)

438
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:12,860
You know, they're still
gonna come after your daughter.

439
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,693
I know.

440
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:29,268
We're gonna get through this.

441
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:34,089
(moves into suspenseful music)

442
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:41,764
Want some soup?

443
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,783
Not hungry.

444
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:49,926
(planter shatters)

445
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:52,426
(dog barking)

446
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,791
(electronic beeping)

447
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,765
(door clicks)

448
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:37,432
Did you hear that?

449
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:45,427
(beeps)

450
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:57,372
Ah, the soup's ready.

451
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,623
Uncle Sylvan, did you bring 'em?

452
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:22,225
Oh, I forgot what you wanted.

453
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:24,219
Was it cookies?

454
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,302
(laughs)

455
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:33,752
Thank you for letting us
stay here, Uncle Sylvan.

456
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,693
Anytime, sweetheart.

457
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:49,258
You got anything in there for me?

458
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:50,925
You're fat enough.

459
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,197
How's she doing?

460
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,030
Same.

461
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:01,206
Doctor says she could be
in a coma indefinitely.

462
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:02,835
Something's going down here.

463
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:04,894
These guys mean business.

464
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:06,932
Why don't you go through channels?

465
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:08,265
Local authorities?

466
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:09,507
No, no, no, no.

467
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:10,970
These guys are wired in.

468
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,817
Who knows who's on the take?

469
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,770
They've gotta be eliminated another way.

470
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,130
So, what'd ya gonna do?

471
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,797
Round up the boys.

472
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:22,845
(bright techno music)

473
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:05,504
Jaz.

474
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:09,718
Hank, how ya doin', man?

475
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:12,237
You look, you look great.

476
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:13,320
What is it?

477
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,789
It's about an operation.

478
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:20,516
No, no way.

479
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:21,735
No, no way.
(bell rings)

480
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,909
Hank, Hank, Hank, hold on, will ya?

481
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:25,202
[Hank] This way please.

482
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,380
[Jaz] Will ya relax?

483
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,965
I got all the boys
together, the whole band.

484
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,873
We need ya, Hank.
I'm done with that.

485
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:31,137
I'm out, Jaz.

486
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:32,520
I got a good job.

487
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,593
I don't get blown up.

488
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:36,054
I'm happy.

489
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:38,637
You're happy being a bellboy?

490
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:43,439
I'm a bellman.

491
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,538
Ah, sorry.

492
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:50,849
Well, hey, bellman, this
mission includes Aldo.

493
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:57,752
What's going on?

494
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,643
(funky techno music)

495
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:02,893
(grunting)

496
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:15,457
Hey, Crunchy.

497
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:16,707
[Crunch] Hey!

498
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:20,376
Cut, cut, cut.

499
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:22,199
What the hell is goin' on here?

500
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,949
Somebody get him out of the pool.

501
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,227
I'm working with idiots.

502
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:30,064
Jasper my friend, what's up?

503
00:39:30,064 --> 00:39:31,000
- How ya doin', bro?
- Good.

504
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,547
Hankie, big five. (Cheers)

505
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:34,413
Hey, hey, hey, ya mind?

506
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,143
I'm trying to make a video here.

507
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,226
(laughs)

508
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:43,702
Take five.

509
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:45,445
Dry him off.

510
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:47,583
Grab anything you want, guys, it's free.

511
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,314
You still chewing the coffee beans?

512
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:50,778
[Crunch] Always, man.

513
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:52,568
(crunching)

514
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:53,961
You eat this shit?

515
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:55,427
Little bit.

516
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,079
Jesus.

517
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,196
You figured out why we're here yet?

518
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,169
Must be something serious.

519
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:03,252
Let me guess.

520
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:06,853
You're putting the band back together.

521
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:08,766
We're all invited back to your place

522
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,425
for a little rock and roll.

523
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:12,525
Something like that.

524
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:14,702
(crunching)

525
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:16,285
How's Anna doin'?

526
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:21,310
My name is Dexter Heath.

527
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:27,580
Before we begin, how many of
you truly love your mouse?

528
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:31,839
Good, because you have to love it

529
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,589
and treat it with great respect.

530
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:37,578
If you push it or squeeze it too hard,

531
00:40:37,578 --> 00:40:39,841
it will not respond to your touch.

532
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:42,362
Now, let's turn on our computers.

533
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:45,529
One, two...
(whistles)

534
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:47,749
Crunch.

535
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,422
Figure it out yourselves.

536
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,745
Yeah, that's good, man.

537
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:55,912
We gotta talk.

538
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,940
♫ Ooh, I'm rockin' baby

539
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,605
♫ Ooh, and I'm rockin' baby

540
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,521
♫ Whoa, I'm rockin' baby

541
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:04,310
♫ Oh, but I'm rockin' baby

542
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,185
♫ Uh, but I'm rockin' baby

543
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:07,775
♫ Oh, but I'm rockin' girl

544
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:08,608
Brock.

545
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,193
♫ Girl, yeah, baby

546
00:41:10,193 --> 00:41:11,284
Brock!

547
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,117
Hey!

548
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:14,418
Hey.

549
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,044
Hey.

550
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:21,127
(funky techno music)

551
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,531
Yo, yo, yo, I got next, baby.

552
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,781
(cheering)

553
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:36,018
Put me down, please.

554
00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:38,339
Hankie, you're as white as ever, baby.

555
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,645
Yo, my friend, what's up! (Cheers)

556
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:43,234
Hug that nut.

557
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,836
Come on, what's up?

558
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,076
[Brock] Come on, baby.

559
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:47,659
Up in, there ya go.

560
00:41:48,558 --> 00:41:51,891
Come on, baby, shoot it up, shoot it up.

561
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:54,920
Timeout.

562
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:06,207
Kim.

563
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:12,535
I thought you said you'd brief them.

564
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,165
You're right, I did.

565
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,809
I just didn't say when.

566
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,897
Gentlemen, this is Kim Barnes,

567
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:21,814
new member of our team.

568
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:30,307
[Crunch] Jaz, can I
have a word with you?

569
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:31,140
Sure.

570
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:37,755
We need a sniper.

571
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,071
What the hell am I?

572
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:41,494
Well, you're stunningly handsome,

573
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:42,548
and a great beach volleyball player...

574
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:43,381
Jaz.

575
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:48,857
Okay, when's the last
time you saw action?

576
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,901
Just did this war movie.

577
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:54,141
All right, all right.

578
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:56,334
She comes highly recommended.

579
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,634
By whom?

580
00:42:57,634 --> 00:42:58,467
Sylvan.

581
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:07,182
So who's Buffy?

582
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:10,899
She's part of the team.

583
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:16,431
I think they like you.

584
00:43:19,572 --> 00:43:21,905
(moves to dramatic music)

585
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:22,738
Braga!

586
00:43:24,178 --> 00:43:27,123
Braga, are we ready or what?

587
00:43:27,123 --> 00:43:28,964
Well, I've had difficulty increasing

588
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:30,914
the potency factor with the palladium,

589
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:33,185
so I introduced lead into the mixture.

590
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:36,318
However, the behavior of
lead is not 100% predictable.

591
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:38,799
On top of that, we also can't be 100% sure

592
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:40,746
of a constant expiration time,

593
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:42,085
due to the nature of human genetic...

594
00:43:42,085 --> 00:43:43,884
Blah, blah, blah.

595
00:43:43,884 --> 00:43:45,218
Was there a yes or a no in there?

596
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:47,125
What the fuck is it, a yes or a no?

597
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,590
Well, we're close.

598
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,134
No, listen to me you little bugger,

599
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:53,143
or whatever the fuck you guys
call yourselves over there.

600
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:53,976
Yes or no?

601
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:59,233
Yes, but I need to conduct a test.

602
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:00,066
Fine.

603
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:01,818
Set it up.

604
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:07,391
(hawk screeching)

605
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:09,516
(waves crashing)

606
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:12,358
(gentle music)

607
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,441
So, you wanted to see me?

608
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,770
It's beautiful, isn't it?

609
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:23,211
How long does a man
live, what, 70, 80 years?

610
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:27,373
I want that.

611
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:31,248
Dad, they're digging where you said.

612
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:34,056
Still haven't found anything.

613
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:36,536
I'm very disappointed.

614
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:38,246
[Drey] I know.

615
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:39,079
In you.

616
00:44:41,786 --> 00:44:42,997
What?

617
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:44,474
The one thing that could jeopardize

618
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,292
the success of this operation,

619
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,625
I gave you to take care
of and you failed me.

620
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,042
What are you talking about?

621
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,935
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
wait a fuckin' minute.

622
00:44:54,935 --> 00:44:57,822
I blew that sonofabitch
off the face of the earth.

623
00:44:57,822 --> 00:44:59,239
Apparently not.

624
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:04,447
Oh, Jesus Christ!

625
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:07,376
Don't tell me the fuckin'
psychic hotline called.

626
00:45:07,376 --> 00:45:09,344
I was there, I fuckin'
blew him up, he's dead!

627
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:10,177
All right, all right.

628
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:12,469
Take it easy, take it easy, I apologize.

629
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:16,552
The medication sometimes
makes me a little crazy.

630
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:21,529
I got some shit to take care of.

631
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,192
Damn it!

632
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:31,512
He's not dead.

633
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,095
I know, find him.

634
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:38,574
Find the sonofabitch.

635
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:44,606
(coughing)

636
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:54,201
(moans)

637
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:59,114
Could you open the
door a little, sweetie?

638
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:00,531
It's hot in here.

639
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:02,569
Okay.

640
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:12,405
Anna!

641
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:24,710
Where is Aldo Paccione?

642
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,782
I don't know.

643
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,453
I don't believe you.

644
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:29,529
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

645
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:30,994
(groans)

646
00:46:30,994 --> 00:46:33,244
(laughing)

647
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,416
(grunts)

648
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:40,006
Idiot.

649
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,718
(metal scraping)

650
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:57,478
It's delicious, what is it?

651
00:46:57,478 --> 00:46:58,395
Dog food.

652
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,083
(dog whimpers)

653
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:06,779
Here.

654
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:12,420
So what are your plans, Aldo?

655
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,665
Finish business.

656
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,169
You can't do it alone.

657
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:17,169
What choice do I have?

658
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:26,254
(dramatic music)

659
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:32,037
(hawk screeches)

660
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:02,295
(bright techno music)

661
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:09,763
No!

662
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,263
No good, too slow.

663
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,670
Do it again.

664
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,853
Work it out, Aldo.

665
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,686
Real nice, work it out.

666
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:20,513
Oh, there you go, all right.

667
00:48:20,513 --> 00:48:21,682
(clapping)

668
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:22,515
All right, big Hank.

669
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:23,868
Let's go, Hankie!
Work it out, Hank.

670
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,076
Hankie, all right.

671
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:26,501
[Brock] Up and over, come on, buddy!

672
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:27,529
(shouting)

673
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,862
[Hank] No, swing too much!

674
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:32,899
(gunfire)

675
00:48:39,488 --> 00:48:40,905
Bugger, bugger.

676
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,509
You're out.

677
00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:49,486
Damn.

678
00:49:24,653 --> 00:49:27,570
Get ready for a little explosion.

679
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,382
(fire roaring)

680
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:35,706
[Aldo] Was that really necessary?

681
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,539
What the?

682
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:37,539
Yeah, boy!

683
00:49:39,427 --> 00:49:41,760
(owl hoots)

684
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:48,184
Man, I am too old for this shit.

685
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:50,351
[Dex] Hey, look at that.

686
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,993
Hey, Crunch, what's
Hankie over there thinking?

687
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:08,364
(laughing)

688
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,846
So, how do you do it?

689
00:50:17,462 --> 00:50:18,682
What'd ya mean?

690
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,240
You know, the telepathic stuff.

691
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,490
Coffee beans.

692
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:25,514
For me it's the gun.

693
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:36,317
Maybe you can help me understand this.

694
00:50:36,317 --> 00:50:40,317
When I get a target in
my sights, I hear voices.

695
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:42,979
What do they say?

696
00:50:42,979 --> 00:50:44,495
It's okay.

697
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:46,012
Go ahead.

698
00:50:46,012 --> 00:50:47,164
Things like that.

699
00:50:47,164 --> 00:50:49,199
You know, once I heard a voice.

700
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:51,523
It took me a while to realize

701
00:50:51,523 --> 00:50:54,414
the voices must be from the future.

702
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:56,889
It's like the guy's already dead

703
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,203
and he's been waiting for me.

704
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:01,277
It's words already spoken.

705
00:51:01,277 --> 00:51:04,194
But it's not them, it's my voice.

706
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,733
As if...

707
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:10,615
I don't know.

708
00:51:10,615 --> 00:51:11,448
As if...

709
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:13,698
As if you were connected.

710
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,184
Is that it?

711
00:51:18,184 --> 00:51:19,017
Yeah.

712
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:22,172
You know, I believe a piece of each of us

713
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:24,302
lives in everyone else.

714
00:51:24,302 --> 00:51:28,687
Hey, Crunch, what piece of
you lives inside of me, huh?

715
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:31,329
He's talking about filling the infinite,

716
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:33,647
and you're still measuring it in inches.

717
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:35,601
Man, what are you talking about?

718
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:38,524
Crunch is your real name?

719
00:51:38,524 --> 00:51:42,691
No, no, it's Kenny, but
nobody ever calls me that.

720
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:49,953
[Kim] Come on, Kenny.

721
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,376
Oh my god.

722
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:57,206
Where are you guys going?

723
00:51:57,206 --> 00:51:59,405
I'll tell you more.

724
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:03,405
That is the best damn
pickup I have ever seen.

725
00:52:06,352 --> 00:52:09,185
Do you realize how old they are?

726
00:52:11,315 --> 00:52:12,732
Ancient warriors.

727
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:17,244
(ominous music)

728
00:52:17,244 --> 00:52:18,436
We're getting close.

729
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:20,892
What does the seismograph tell you?

730
00:52:20,892 --> 00:52:25,559
There is something there,
but I don't know what.

731
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,392
Good, keep digging, you find it.

732
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,125
Good job.

733
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,664
It's just a field test.

734
00:52:40,664 --> 00:52:43,331
Tiny village, middle of nowhere.

735
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:46,797
How many people?

736
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:50,743
Hundred or so.

737
00:52:50,743 --> 00:52:52,048
Is that enough?

738
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:54,048
For our purposes, yes.

739
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:01,925
Prego.

740
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:02,758
Grazie.

741
00:53:05,593 --> 00:53:08,260
He must have failed a student.

742
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:11,858
(laughs)

743
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:13,364
You know what's great
about this restaurant

744
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:15,527
is they have an excellent calamari.

745
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:16,360
Mm-hmm.

746
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:20,470
My wife loved calamari.

747
00:53:21,757 --> 00:53:24,855
She was a beautiful
woman, we were soulmates.

748
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,128
Lived in New Mexico, you
ever been to New Mexico?

749
00:53:27,128 --> 00:53:28,878
Yeah, Roswell once.

750
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:35,357
She worked for the government
lab down in Los Alamos,

751
00:53:35,357 --> 00:53:37,575
became exposed to some damn thing.

752
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:40,120
Sooner or later, it got to her.

753
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,071
She died a painful death.

754
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:44,388
Of course, the bastards
denied responsibility.

755
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,602
They always do, but I know better.

756
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:50,269
So, this isn't about politics.

757
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:56,478
Killing the American ambassador
was just a wake-up call.

758
00:53:56,478 --> 00:53:59,404
Taking out a U.S. sub base
during a presidential visit,

759
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,422
now that's really...

760
00:54:00,422 --> 00:54:01,733
Justice.

761
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:03,197
(laughs)

762
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,783
What about you?

763
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,883
[Sonya] What?

764
00:54:05,883 --> 00:54:06,995
Were you ever married?

765
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:08,415
Yeah.

766
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:09,795
And?

767
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:11,055
He died.

768
00:54:11,055 --> 00:54:12,600
I'm sorry to hear that.

769
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,683
Don't be, I killed him.

770
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,415
The lab is about there.

771
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:30,533
What about manpower,
what do you think they got?

772
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,450
I don't know, 50, 60.

773
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,784
Sounds like we could
use some more intel.

774
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:39,034
Hey, chaps, have a look at this.

775
00:54:39,034 --> 00:54:40,298
[Reporter] I'm here with you live

776
00:54:40,298 --> 00:54:43,186
in the small town of
Ollolai in Central Sardinia,

777
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:45,915
where over 100 people
have been found dead.

778
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,661
The area has been cordoned off,

779
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:50,223
and a state of emergency
has been declared.

780
00:54:50,223 --> 00:54:53,717
We'll have more information
for you as events develop.

781
00:54:53,717 --> 00:54:56,119
I knew people in that town.

782
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,119
It won't happen again.

783
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,283
(dramatic music)

784
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:09,060
[Drey] Did we double check the time?

785
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,560
4:00 p.m. sharp, the day after tomorrow.

786
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,274
I think it's time we get the stuff

787
00:55:17,274 --> 00:55:19,441
over here from the island.

788
00:55:20,636 --> 00:55:22,469
Ain't that just sweet?

789
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:30,858
I'm glad you could all join me

790
00:55:30,858 --> 00:55:33,658
for this little celebration.

791
00:55:33,658 --> 00:55:35,322
(laughs)

792
00:55:35,322 --> 00:55:36,155
All right.

793
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:39,197
Here's to a job well done.

794
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,229
(group cheering)

795
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:45,794
I'm sorry it took such
a long time to perfect.

796
00:55:45,794 --> 00:55:47,258
Oh, don't be so modest.

797
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:50,258
Come on, you did it right, it works.

798
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:53,124
I don't drink.

799
00:55:53,124 --> 00:55:54,506
I don't care.

800
00:55:54,506 --> 00:55:55,809
Now, listen up, everybody.

801
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,052
We've had a good trial run.

802
00:55:58,052 --> 00:55:59,801
Now let's do it for real.

803
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:01,051
[Group] Yeah.

804
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:06,125
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

805
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,540
(exciting orchestral music)

806
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,707
(man speaking in foreign language)

807
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:18,064
Hey, hey, what the fuck?

808
00:56:18,064 --> 00:56:21,647
Come on, shithead, you
know what's in that?

809
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:25,826
That ain't olive oil they're
moving down there, boys.

810
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:27,826
Uh-oh, check this out.

811
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:37,572
They must be getting ready transport.

812
00:56:37,572 --> 00:56:39,545
Hankie, can you rig something up

813
00:56:39,545 --> 00:56:42,269
with enough C-4 to blow up the entrance?

814
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:43,102
Can do.

815
00:56:43,102 --> 00:56:44,625
Kim, back up Hankie.

816
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,661
Dex, set up surveillance here.

817
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:48,632
The rest of you, let's go.

818
00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:51,382
(exciting music)

819
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:12,361
[Kim] Hold.

820
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:13,210
What?

821
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,627
We've got company, hang on.

822
00:57:18,044 --> 00:57:19,127
You're clear.

823
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:37,166
You are a black man, it's night,

824
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,166
we're going into a mine.

825
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:42,043
And your point?

826
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,220
Looks good, man.

827
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,187
Thank you.

828
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:47,395
You about done?

829
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:49,053
[Brock] Yeah.

830
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:49,970
Let's go.

831
00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:11,587
(gunfire)

832
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:12,894
(grunts)

833
00:58:12,894 --> 00:58:14,477
Fan out, fan out!

834
00:58:21,549 --> 00:58:23,882
What the hell is going on?

835
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:26,532
They're trying to take us out.

836
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:27,615
Someone is trying to take us out.

837
00:58:27,615 --> 00:58:28,943
I have no fuckin' idea who it is.

838
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:30,771
Well, think, son of a bitch.

839
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:32,293
Who do you think it is?

840
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:33,126
Fuck.

841
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:38,333
(shushing)
(man shouts)

842
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,189
Someone's coming.

843
00:58:40,189 --> 00:58:42,727
(alarm blaring)

844
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,894
(gunfire)

845
00:58:52,978 --> 00:58:54,890
Hankie, time.

846
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,890
I need another minute.

847
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,583
This is the part I hate.

848
00:59:07,056 --> 00:59:08,473
Explosives set.

849
00:59:11,203 --> 00:59:14,255
[Mercenary] It's gonna blow!

850
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:16,838
(fire roaring)

851
00:59:24,016 --> 00:59:26,466
You're fucking dead!

852
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:28,976
(alarm blaring)

853
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:30,976
Hankie, where are you?

854
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,328
I'm heading toward you.

855
00:59:35,328 --> 00:59:37,359
Dex, what's my 20?

856
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,249
You need to move ahead
until the first intersection,

857
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:43,012
and look out for the bad guys.

858
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,193
Where are they?

859
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:45,643
I don't know.

860
00:59:45,643 --> 00:59:47,431
They're not on my screen.

861
00:59:47,431 --> 00:59:48,264
Great.

862
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:50,728
(gunfire)

863
00:59:50,728 --> 00:59:51,561
Shit.

864
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,680
My computer!

865
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,022
You bastards!

866
00:59:56,022 --> 00:59:57,772
You bastards, nobody,

867
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:01,151
nobody messes with my computer!

868
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:05,159
I'll teach you to mess with my technology!

869
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,106
(suspenseful music)

870
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:10,189
No, no, no, no, no, no!

871
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:14,658
(fire rumbling)

872
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:18,571
(exciting music)

873
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:21,427
Oh, that can't be good.

874
01:00:21,427 --> 01:00:23,235
Let's get out of here.

875
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:25,619
(alarm blaring)

876
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:29,119
Secure the lab, and turn that thing off.

877
01:00:30,383 --> 01:00:31,216
Which way?

878
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,272
Which way?

879
01:00:33,272 --> 01:00:34,189
This way.

880
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,303
Dex, talk to me.

881
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:43,817
Aldo, where is everybody?

882
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:46,091
[Aldo] They're on the way to the lab.

883
01:00:46,091 --> 01:00:48,369
Find an elevator shaft.

884
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:50,952
Find an elevator shaft, yeah.

885
01:00:54,595 --> 01:00:57,303
I can't even find my feet.

886
01:00:57,303 --> 01:01:00,303
(suspenseful music)

887
01:01:08,976 --> 01:01:11,559
I suggest you drop your guns.

888
01:01:14,347 --> 01:01:16,930
Well, well, well, well, well,

889
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:19,862
Aldo Paccione,

890
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:22,906
and Jasper Harding.

891
01:01:22,906 --> 01:01:24,845
What the hell are you doin'?

892
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:26,518
I mean, everything was going fine until

893
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:29,621
you decided to crash our little party.

894
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:32,261
We've been looking all over for you.

895
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:34,297
Where have you been hiding?

896
01:01:34,297 --> 01:01:38,078
And look at this little
group of yours, how cute.

897
01:01:38,078 --> 01:01:42,101
Did you really think
you were gonna stop us?

898
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:43,770
We're not dead yet, pal.

899
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,393
No you are not, yet.

900
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:48,752
A little glitch in the
operation of course,

901
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:51,815
kinda like the first time
when we didn't get the money,

902
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:55,230
but oh my god, I mean, when
that ambassador's car blew up,

903
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:58,446
I mean, that was pure genius.

904
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,607
You killed my father.

905
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:01,867
What?

906
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:04,867
What the hell are you talkin' about?

907
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,220
That was your father?

908
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,861
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

909
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:15,126
I really feel terrible.

910
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:16,266
You're going down.

911
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,266
No, you're going down.

912
01:02:20,622 --> 01:02:22,205
Get 'em outta here.

913
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:29,448
You are wrong.

914
01:02:29,448 --> 01:02:30,448
We'll see.

915
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:34,611
(suspenseful music)

916
01:02:49,444 --> 01:02:51,600
(rumbling)

917
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,850
(grunting)

918
01:02:56,358 --> 01:02:57,275
Oh, shit.

919
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,311
(whistling)

920
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,168
[Hank] Guys!

921
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:09,714
Nice boomage, Hankie.

922
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:11,411
You wouldn't believe what I ran into.

923
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:13,527
I saw skeletons, rats the size of dogs!

924
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:15,071
Yeah, we're moving, Hank.

925
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:15,924
Okay.

926
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:17,734
Which way?

927
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:19,851
(crunching)

928
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:22,409
This way feels good, let's go.

929
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:23,837
[Mercenary] They escaped.

930
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:27,124
They're heading toward the cliff.

931
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:30,791
Block off the other
tunnel, I'm on my way.

932
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:47,789
Uh, fellas?

933
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,457
I don't think so.

934
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,153
Shit.

935
01:04:04,688 --> 01:04:07,105
Whoa, we've got to go back.

936
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:11,799
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

937
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:13,225
We have to jump.

938
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:17,116
Yeah, right, jump, that's a good one.

939
01:04:17,116 --> 01:04:18,297
I'm not jumping.

940
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:19,392
We did not cover this in training.

941
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:20,613
Did we cover this in training?

942
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:22,118
Oh, this way feels good.

943
01:04:22,118 --> 01:04:23,462
What are you chewin' on, decaf?

944
01:04:23,462 --> 01:04:24,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

945
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:26,143
What's the worse thing
that can happen, boys?

946
01:04:26,143 --> 01:04:27,394
We could die.

947
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:30,237
(helicopter thwapping)

948
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:33,207
(gunfire)

949
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,790
Or we could jump.

950
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:43,359
Get me down there.

951
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,109
(exciting music)

952
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,576
Jesus Christ, they're jumping.

953
01:04:57,576 --> 01:04:59,743
(gunfire)

954
01:05:08,395 --> 01:05:11,562
(screaming excitedly)

955
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,518
Whoa, whoa, where you going?

956
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:16,515
Come on, take me there, get me!

957
01:05:16,515 --> 01:05:18,206
There is thermal coming off the cliff.

958
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,539
Fuck the thermal, come on.

959
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,009
Come on, let's go.

960
01:05:30,873 --> 01:05:33,040
Do you need a little help?

961
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:35,678
I can do it, I can do it.

962
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:37,299
[Aldo] You jump first!

963
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:40,049
(prolonged yell)

964
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,866
(helicopter thwapping)

965
01:06:01,864 --> 01:06:04,781
(muttering curses)

966
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:07,945
Fucking geez fuck.

967
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:16,084
No, no, no, no, no, no!

968
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:18,379
Come on, take me back in there, come on!

969
01:06:18,379 --> 01:06:20,879
I can't, thermal too strong.

970
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:23,572
Fuck!

971
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:28,551
(moves to gloomy dramatic music)

972
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:08,909
Vaya con Dios.

973
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:14,413
(machine buzzing and whirring)

974
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:25,020
(gloomy music)

975
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,937
(speaking in foreign language)

976
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:40,175
(ghostly whispers)

977
01:08:40,175 --> 01:08:42,342
(screams)

978
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,170
(coughing heavily)

979
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,137
(gagging)

980
01:08:58,444 --> 01:09:00,802
[Aldo] If the team
wants to leave, let them.

981
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:02,022
No questions asked.

982
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:03,538
I'm going back.

983
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:04,704
Aldo, we just lost Hank.

984
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:06,296
You can't do that.

985
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:07,871
He's right, Aldo.

986
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:09,207
If we go back there,
we're as good as dead.

987
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:10,552
Is that what you want?

988
01:09:10,552 --> 01:09:12,907
Sylvan, call our friends in Rome.

989
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:16,527
Request reinforcements,
you know who you can trust.

990
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,096
Now you're thinkin'.

991
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:20,336
They can back us up.

992
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:22,007
I have a plan.

993
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:23,924
It was a premonition.

994
01:09:24,817 --> 01:09:25,650
A warning.

995
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:31,077
(soft orchestral music)

996
01:09:31,077 --> 01:09:31,910
You...

997
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,078
You want me to stop digging.

998
01:09:36,078 --> 01:09:37,245
[Sonya] Yes.

999
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,940
You know that I trust you,
you know that I believe in you,

1000
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,357
but this, this is about life.

1001
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:49,269
Life is on the line.

1002
01:09:50,655 --> 01:09:51,488
My life!

1003
01:09:52,532 --> 01:09:53,615
I can't stop!

1004
01:09:55,873 --> 01:09:56,873
And I won't.

1005
01:10:20,428 --> 01:10:22,428
That's the gist of it.

1006
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:25,693
What do you guys think?

1007
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:29,508
I don't care, I'm not going back.

1008
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:30,933
He's right, man.

1009
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:32,285
I mean, what's the point?

1010
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:33,950
Hold on, hold on.

1011
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,920
Jaz, you said we got more
people coming, right?

1012
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,087
I say we wait.

1013
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:41,697
Kim?

1014
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:45,501
I'm with Kenny on this one.

1015
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:47,167
Jaz, talk to him, you know him better...

1016
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:49,250
What'd you want me to...

1017
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:16,610
The ventilation tunnels go everywhere.

1018
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,357
They're built by the ancient warriors

1019
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,923
who used them to fight off the enemy.

1020
01:11:20,923 --> 01:11:23,407
I never thought I'd have to use them,

1021
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:26,296
but I have no choice,
it's the only way in.

1022
01:11:26,296 --> 01:11:27,850
Are you really gonna do this?

1023
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,722
The lab has to be destroyed.

1024
01:11:29,722 --> 01:11:32,573
Aldo, what about waiting for backup?

1025
01:11:32,573 --> 01:11:35,741
It takes them a day to get organized.

1026
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:38,670
The element of surprise is on my side.

1027
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,740
They'll never expect me to go back in.

1028
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,248
He's right.

1029
01:11:42,248 --> 01:11:45,581
I'm not asking anything of any of you.

1030
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:53,005
(dramatic orchestral music)

1031
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:03,936
I must finish this.

1032
01:12:03,936 --> 01:12:05,569
I don't wanna hear this.

1033
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:07,872
Anna, you have to understand.

1034
01:12:07,872 --> 01:12:10,839
No, Aldo, enough is enough.

1035
01:12:10,839 --> 01:12:14,006
(helicopter whirring)

1036
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,136
Where is Dylan?

1037
01:12:19,136 --> 01:12:22,469
She's on the beach playing with Zorro.

1038
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:51,057
Oh, Papa.

1039
01:12:51,057 --> 01:12:51,890
Dylan.

1040
01:12:53,126 --> 01:12:54,043
Big boom.

1041
01:12:56,057 --> 01:12:59,724
(swelling orchestral music)

1042
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:16,496
It's small.

1043
01:13:16,496 --> 01:13:17,329
It's tiny.

1044
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:18,727
It's impossible!

1045
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,359
There's no way a man of my girth

1046
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:21,834
is gonna make it down that hole.

1047
01:13:21,834 --> 01:13:24,358
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hang on there, big man.

1048
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,762
I'm not exactly a Welterweight, but,

1049
01:13:26,762 --> 01:13:30,330
give it a little shimmy
and a little shammy.

1050
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:31,556
[Dex] Are you sure?

1051
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:32,473
Oh, yeah.

1052
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:36,290
What is it that the more
you take away from it,

1053
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,322
the bigger it gets?

1054
01:13:38,322 --> 01:13:39,538
A hole.

1055
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:41,565
(laughing)
[Dex] Jaz, Jaz?

1056
01:13:41,565 --> 01:13:42,798
Stuck there, buddy?

1057
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,130
Christ. (Laughs)

1058
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,367
Are you stuck, Jaz?

1059
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:47,167
Yes, I'm stuck, you
idiots, get me outta here.

1060
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:48,631
Come on, help him out.

1061
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:49,922
Pooh bear, maybe you should
cut back on the honey.

1062
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:51,798
[Jaz] Agh, who's grabbin' my underwear?

1063
01:13:51,798 --> 01:13:53,009
[Crunch] Come on, get him up.

1064
01:13:53,009 --> 01:13:55,259
(grunting)

1065
01:13:57,613 --> 01:13:59,156
We're not going in that way.

1066
01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:01,595
Of course not, that's a rabbit hole.

1067
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:04,147
The ventilation shaft is over here.

1068
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:05,419
[Crunch] Big fuckin' rabbit.

1069
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:06,252
Shit.

1070
01:14:07,331 --> 01:14:10,713
Of course not, that is a rabbit hole.

1071
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:13,599
The ventilation shaft is over here.

1072
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:16,182
(gloomy music)

1073
01:14:17,938 --> 01:14:18,778
(knocking)

1074
01:14:18,778 --> 01:14:19,635
What?

1075
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:22,645
Sir, the second chopper
spotted the wreckage.

1076
01:14:22,645 --> 01:14:24,026
They're all dead.

1077
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:24,859
What?

1078
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:31,121
Get out.

1079
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:32,912
Get out!

1080
01:14:41,968 --> 01:14:44,218
(coughing)

1081
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:06,697
Come on, let's go, hurry up.

1082
01:15:06,697 --> 01:15:09,197
We don't have all fuckin' day.

1083
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:11,090
Damn it.

1084
01:15:15,046 --> 01:15:17,078
What the hell is goin' on here?

1085
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:18,420
We're evacuating.

1086
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,253
What?

1087
01:15:19,253 --> 01:15:20,522
Oh, no, we're not. Who
gave you the right...

1088
01:15:20,522 --> 01:15:23,646
Dad! It's over we're done.

1089
01:15:23,646 --> 01:15:26,058
Not until I say so.

1090
01:15:26,058 --> 01:15:29,488
Look, I'm sorry you didn't
find your miracle cure,

1091
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,488
but we need to relocate.

1092
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:33,898
Relocate?

1093
01:15:33,898 --> 01:15:35,931
Jesus Christ, don't you get it?

1094
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,127
We don't know where the
fuck those guys are,

1095
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:38,386
or who they told.

1096
01:15:38,386 --> 01:15:40,457
We're leaving, we can't stay here.

1097
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:41,290
We.

1098
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,042
Are not

1099
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:45,972
going anywhere.

1100
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:48,470
This is my project.

1101
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:54,903
You stupid old man.

1102
01:15:54,903 --> 01:15:56,653
If you stay, you die.

1103
01:15:59,463 --> 01:16:00,296
If I go,

1104
01:16:01,701 --> 01:16:02,534
I die.

1105
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:07,686
(dramatic orchestral music)

1106
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,479
Get out of my way.

1107
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:37,684
Whatever he tells you,
you don't listen to him,

1108
01:16:37,684 --> 01:16:40,101
you listen to me now, got it?

1109
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:44,174
Keep it movin'.

1110
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:01,951
Which way?

1111
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,381
[Dex] I think it's this way.

1112
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:05,141
You think?

1113
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:08,165
Would anybody else
like to read this map?

1114
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:08,998
Right.

1115
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:25,317
(coughs)

1116
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:33,860
(coughing heavily)

1117
01:18:06,151 --> 01:18:07,151
Oh, Jesus.

1118
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,033
Crunch?

1119
01:18:23,004 --> 01:18:23,837
Crunch?

1120
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:27,201
Crunch?

1121
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:28,845
Yeah?

1122
01:18:28,845 --> 01:18:30,095
Are you okay?

1123
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,822
Yeah, I'm fine.

1124
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:35,197
You and Kim, check out the tunnel.

1125
01:18:35,197 --> 01:18:36,538
We'll meet you back here.

1126
01:18:36,538 --> 01:18:37,371
Let's go.

1127
01:18:38,657 --> 01:18:39,615
I don't care.

1128
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,920
He's got nothing to do with
this operation anymore.

1129
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,753
I am in charge, you do what I say.

1130
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:47,050
He's lost his mind.

1131
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,050
I know, he won't listen to reason.

1132
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:54,314
Did you get our insurance?

1133
01:18:57,385 --> 01:19:00,468
(frightened breaths)

1134
01:19:12,603 --> 01:19:15,603
(suspenseful music)

1135
01:19:30,177 --> 01:19:33,406
I'm gonna ask you this once
and I'm not fuckin' around.

1136
01:19:33,406 --> 01:19:38,151
We're not playing the
I'll-ask-you-one-more-time game.

1137
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:40,724
It's a two-part question, okay?

1138
01:19:40,724 --> 01:19:41,974
Where are they?

1139
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:48,459
(gasping)

1140
01:19:48,459 --> 01:19:50,376
And who have they told?

1141
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:54,569
No!

1142
01:19:55,773 --> 01:19:57,773
That's the wrong answer.

1143
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:02,230
(Dylan crying out)

1144
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,589
(cries out mockingly)

1145
01:20:04,589 --> 01:20:07,089
What fucking language is that?

1146
01:20:09,616 --> 01:20:12,655
Mommy doesn't wanna talk, but maybe...

1147
01:20:12,655 --> 01:20:14,375
(screams painfully)

1148
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,792
Don't you dare.

1149
01:20:16,804 --> 01:20:19,461
Let's see if we can make Mommy remember.

1150
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:20,294
Please.

1151
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:25,997
(humming)
(crying)

1152
01:20:25,997 --> 01:20:27,914
All right! All right!

1153
01:20:30,081 --> 01:20:30,914
Just stop.

1154
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:37,069
He's coming here. He's coming here.

1155
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:39,319
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

1156
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:42,059
And that's the right answer!

1157
01:20:42,059 --> 01:20:45,059
(explosion rumbles)

1158
01:20:46,018 --> 01:20:49,935
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1159
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:55,458
(gunfire)

1160
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:58,482
(yelling)

1161
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:11,305
Yeah!

1162
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:14,173
Go, go, go, now, now, go!

1163
01:21:14,173 --> 01:21:15,006
Go!

1164
01:21:31,243 --> 01:21:32,472
Hey, boys.

1165
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:33,888
Where the hell you been,
you missed all the fun.

1166
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:35,388
Not all the fun.

1167
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,439
[Drey] Move, move!

1168
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:09,189
(exciting music)

1169
01:22:49,723 --> 01:22:50,723
Follow me.

1170
01:23:39,696 --> 01:23:40,801
Which way?

1171
01:23:40,801 --> 01:23:41,896
I'm not sure.

1172
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:43,121
Just look at the damn map.

1173
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:44,223
I can't.

1174
01:23:44,223 --> 01:23:45,056
Why not?

1175
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:47,657
I lost it.

1176
01:23:47,657 --> 01:23:51,127
Shit, you stupid ass
computer fuckin' Urkel geek!

1177
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:53,710
Well, fuck you, you fat fuck!

1178
01:23:55,258 --> 01:23:58,008
Ooh, I'm gonna, ooh, I'm gonna.

1179
01:24:00,707 --> 01:24:02,624
No one came this way.

1180
01:24:25,378 --> 01:24:27,628
(grunting)

1181
01:24:44,551 --> 01:24:46,884
(crunching)

1182
01:24:50,866 --> 01:24:52,456
Shit.

1183
01:24:52,456 --> 01:24:56,206
(moves to suspenseful music)

1184
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,067
A worthy opponent.

1185
01:25:04,924 --> 01:25:08,424
But unfortunately, you are out of bullets.

1186
01:25:09,665 --> 01:25:12,248
(gun clicking)

1187
01:25:14,862 --> 01:25:19,029
You're right, (crunches) but she's not.

1188
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:30,166
She talks too much.

1189
01:25:34,953 --> 01:25:37,061
[Brock] Hey, slow your ass down, man!

1190
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:39,143
Where are you taking me,
to the devil's basement?

1191
01:25:39,143 --> 01:25:40,177
[Dex] Just because
you're physically dense,

1192
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,459
doesn't mean you make mental sense!

1193
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:44,503
[Brock] I'm book smart,
brother, I went to high school.

1194
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:47,399
I got a big gun and I will shoot your ass!

1195
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:50,982
(bickering simultaneously)

1196
01:25:52,048 --> 01:25:53,119
[Mercenary] We're under attack.

1197
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:55,516
(gunfire)
We can't hold out.

1198
01:25:55,516 --> 01:25:57,477
Everyone is deserting.

1199
01:25:57,477 --> 01:25:58,620
Cosimo.

1200
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,453
Cosimo!

1201
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:01,482
God damn it!

1202
01:26:02,482 --> 01:26:05,050
Where are you going, ya pussies!

1203
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:05,883
Pussies!

1204
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:14,946
(screams)

1205
01:26:24,395 --> 01:26:25,478
Whoa, whoa!

1206
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,969
You guys all right?

1207
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:30,802
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1208
01:26:30,802 --> 01:26:32,162
Where is Dex and Brock?

1209
01:26:32,162 --> 01:26:35,140
They went up top, we lost them.

1210
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,207
All right, we're heading for Mayhew.

1211
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:38,290
Hey, Chief.

1212
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:40,292
Anna's here.

1213
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:44,699
So's Dylan.

1214
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:49,177
Anna.

1215
01:26:49,177 --> 01:26:50,944
[Drey] Aldo!

1216
01:26:50,944 --> 01:26:52,775
I'll find you!
Get out now.

1217
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:54,108
That's an order.

1218
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,014
I'll cover him, you guys watch his back.

1219
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:03,181
All right, you go this
way, I'll go up that way.

1220
01:27:04,044 --> 01:27:04,877
Anna!

1221
01:27:05,772 --> 01:27:06,880
Aldo!

1222
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,713
Aldo.

1223
01:27:17,486 --> 01:27:19,922
Ah, nice of you to drop by.

1224
01:27:19,922 --> 01:27:20,755
Do you know, if you were dead,

1225
01:27:20,755 --> 01:27:22,896
this whole thing could've been avoided.

1226
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:27,023
Let her go, if you want to stay alive.

1227
01:27:27,023 --> 01:27:28,425
Tempting.

1228
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:29,891
But no!

1229
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:32,541
You've destroyed everything I worked for!

1230
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:34,091
What, mass murder?

1231
01:27:34,091 --> 01:27:35,814
It's very profitable.

1232
01:27:35,814 --> 01:27:36,981
Not anymore.

1233
01:27:38,312 --> 01:27:39,931
Fuck you!

1234
01:27:39,931 --> 01:27:41,348
No, no, no, no!

1235
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:45,598
Let her go, and you can have me.

1236
01:27:45,598 --> 01:27:46,992
You?

1237
01:27:46,992 --> 01:27:49,930
What the fuck am I gonna do with you?

1238
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,513
We're in love, man.

1239
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,392
(laughs maniacally)

1240
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:58,472
Throw the gun over here.

1241
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:01,908
Now, let her go.

1242
01:28:01,908 --> 01:28:02,741
Shut up!

1243
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:10,665
(dramatic music)

1244
01:28:11,838 --> 01:28:14,088
(grunting)

1245
01:28:33,579 --> 01:28:36,079
(screams out)

1246
01:28:55,716 --> 01:28:58,544
[Anna] Baby, thank God.

1247
01:28:58,544 --> 01:28:59,544
Excuse me.

1248
01:29:02,221 --> 01:29:03,638
Little help here.

1249
01:29:04,712 --> 01:29:06,997
Okay, sweetie, come on out.

1250
01:29:06,997 --> 01:29:07,830
Papa!

1251
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:13,517
Let's get the hell outta here.

1252
01:29:13,517 --> 01:29:17,628
I have one more thing to take care of.

1253
01:29:17,628 --> 01:29:19,670
Come here, he'll be fine, he'll be fine.

1254
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:20,503
Are you all right?

1255
01:29:20,503 --> 01:29:21,753
Yeah, Kevlar.

1256
01:29:22,606 --> 01:29:25,606
(suspenseful music)

1257
01:29:27,706 --> 01:29:30,623
(ghostly whispers)

1258
01:29:49,295 --> 01:29:51,378
(coughs)

1259
01:30:39,182 --> 01:30:41,349
(gasping)

1260
01:30:44,876 --> 01:30:47,126
(laughing)

1261
01:30:52,471 --> 01:30:55,388
(ghostly whispers)

1262
01:31:05,643 --> 01:31:06,476
No!

1263
01:31:07,487 --> 01:31:08,320
No!

1264
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:17,375
(gun clicks)

1265
01:31:32,956 --> 01:31:33,789
It works.

1266
01:31:34,793 --> 01:31:35,626
It works.

1267
01:31:36,626 --> 01:31:38,793
You think you can stop me?

1268
01:31:47,498 --> 01:31:49,248
You'll never stop me.

1269
01:31:50,197 --> 01:31:52,447
(rumbling)

1270
01:32:06,269 --> 01:32:09,186
(ghostly whispers)

1271
01:32:18,368 --> 01:32:20,701
Consider yourself stopped.

1272
01:32:30,056 --> 01:32:33,556
(moves to peaceful music)

1273
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:37,422
We're gonna try this one more time.

1274
01:32:37,422 --> 01:32:39,005
Get yourself ready.

1275
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:43,197
All right, now, what am I thinking?

1276
01:32:45,639 --> 01:32:46,472
Future.

1277
01:32:47,643 --> 01:32:48,476
Yes.

1278
01:32:49,971 --> 01:32:51,606
Two people.

1279
01:32:51,606 --> 01:32:52,913
Yeah.

1280
01:32:52,913 --> 01:32:53,746
Us?

1281
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:56,885
You're good.

1282
01:32:56,885 --> 01:32:59,968
Now, what are these two people doing?

1283
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:11,236
You're very good.

1284
01:33:12,225 --> 01:33:14,016
(laughing)
[Kim] Come on.

1285
01:33:14,016 --> 01:33:14,849
Come on.

1286
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:17,660
[Crunch] Ow, sweetie, you're on my leg.

1287
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,921
All right, my man, hot dog.

1288
01:33:19,921 --> 01:33:22,921
Hook me up, I'm hungry as a hostage.

1289
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:25,910
(laughs heartily)

1290
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,381
That's funny, man, give me some meat.

1291
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:28,214
That is meat.

1292
01:33:28,214 --> 01:33:30,534
No, man, that ain't no
meat, that's charcoal.

1293
01:33:30,534 --> 01:33:31,596
Charcoal, eh?

1294
01:33:31,596 --> 01:33:33,222
Well, then learn to draw.

1295
01:33:33,222 --> 01:33:34,886
That's it, that's all I've got.

1296
01:33:34,886 --> 01:33:36,995
Well, okay, Stanley.

1297
01:33:36,995 --> 01:33:39,031
Where are the dogs at?

1298
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:41,609
I don't know, I lost them.

1299
01:33:41,609 --> 01:33:44,421
Well, maybe they're with the map.

1300
01:33:44,421 --> 01:33:46,051
Oh, the map, eh?

1301
01:33:46,051 --> 01:33:47,796
You're not gonna let that drop, are you?

1302
01:33:47,796 --> 01:33:48,629
No.

1303
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:49,558
Well, do you know something?

1304
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:51,920
If it wasn't for me, Stanley here,

1305
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,586
you'd all be in that mess still!

1306
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,738
Two days, two days, I haven't eaten!

1307
01:33:55,738 --> 01:33:57,163
Well, go on a diet then!

1308
01:33:57,163 --> 01:34:00,764
(bickering simultaneously)

1309
01:34:00,764 --> 01:34:03,407
Crunch, probably the
second-most feared warrior

1310
01:34:03,407 --> 01:34:05,604
in the history of the U.S. Military.

1311
01:34:05,604 --> 01:34:08,980
Of course, you're looking
at the most feared.

1312
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,730
Do you speak English?

1313
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,545
Huh.

1314
01:34:13,545 --> 01:34:16,882
Sometimes there are no
words, are there, dear?

1315
01:34:16,882 --> 01:34:18,299
Please, continue.

1316
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:26,750
Our family.

1317
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:30,207
(Brock and Dex bickering)

1318
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:31,645
(moaning)

1319
01:34:31,645 --> 01:34:32,883
Go on a diet!

1320
01:34:32,883 --> 01:34:33,853
On a diet?

1321
01:34:33,853 --> 01:34:36,001
Our dysfunctional family.

1322
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:38,584
(Dylan laughs)

1323
01:34:56,221 --> 01:35:00,054
("Su Mare" by Colin O'Malley)

1324
01:35:32,624 --> 01:35:36,041
("Paxi" by Mauro Palmas)

1325
01:35:37,094 --> 01:35:40,927
