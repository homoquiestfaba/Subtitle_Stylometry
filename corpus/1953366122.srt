2
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:00,263
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,674
I never thought
I'd marry a woman

4
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,907
who thought cranberries
were an acceptable thing

5
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,505
to put in bagels.

6
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,949
Of course, I never thought
I'd marry at all,

7
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:47,510
but especially someone
from the West Ooast.

8
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:50,955
I'm from the East Ooast myself...
New York Oity to be exact...

9
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,653
and...

10
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:56,127
I think people that go in
for this mixed-marriage craze

11
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:58,188
are just asking for trouble.

12
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,860
But it just shows to go you,
here I am.

13
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,029
But perhaps
you're asking yourself now

14
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,731
or disturbing
your fellow travelers

15
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:07,865
and asking
your movie companion:

16
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,240
"She seems to be a woman,

17
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:13,610
"and I distinctly heard her say,
'marry a woman.'

18
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,114
"How could this be?

19
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,445
"What's going on here?

20
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:19,919
Did I myself miss something
already?"

21
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:22,251
Well, rest assured

22
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,226
your comprehension
of this movie so far is fine.

23
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,663
Uh!

24
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:35,964
This is what is known
as a lesbian-themed movie.

25
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,765
There are some characters
in this movie

26
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,671
who are gay and lesbian.

27
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:44,438
Of course,
not at the same time.

28
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:45,809
Please quietly leave now

29
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,837
if you mistakenly
went into the wrong theater

30
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,542
at your multiplex.

31
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,574
I'll wait for a moment.

32
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,222
I am glad they left.

33
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,963
They were freaking me out.

34
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,801
Now, this is the point
in the movie where I give you,

35
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,605
the paying audience,
a tad of childhood background.

36
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,476
I've known I was gay
ever since I was DNA.

37
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:22,676
Congratulations, Mrs. Rosen.
It's a baby lesbian.

38
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,612
Well, actually,

39
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:31,886
my coming out
didn't go quite so well.

40
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,790
In Jewish tradition,
when someone dies,

41
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,385
you sit shivah.

42
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,191
It's kind of like a wake,

43
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,130
except there's no body,

44
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,224
you do it after the funeral,

45
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:44,203
and it lasts a week.

46
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:46,364
After I came out
to my parents,

47
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:50,137
it felt like my mom,
the drama queen,

48
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:53,304
wanted to have one for me.

49
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:58,045
Why, why, why couldn't she
go to law school

50
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,518
like her brother?

51
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,627
But after moving
out to California and...

52
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,656
It happens.

53
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,396
Anyhow, after several doses
of The Ellen Show

54
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:18,267
and experiencing
righteous indignation

55
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,034
upon watching
the made-for-TV film

56
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,007
The Margarethe Cammermeyer
Story...

57
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:26,411
produced by the Jewish goddess
herself, Babs Streisand...

58
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:29,279
my mother had
a radical transformation.

59
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:32,877
Now she's the head
of her local PFLAG chapter.

60
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,079
For the uninitiated,

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,849
that's Parents, Families,
and Friends

62
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,823
of Lesbians and Gays.

63
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,451
She marches in parades;
she writes letters;

64
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,393
she leads protests.

65
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,397
Basically, she's on a mission.

66
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,697
So when I broke up
with my girlfriend...

67
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,703
or rather,

68
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,864
when I was left for dead
by the side of the road

69
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,875
after my ex
destroyed everything

70
00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:00,903
I held near and dear
to my heart,

71
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,973
grinding her spiked high heel
into the remains

72
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,542
of any self-respect
I had left over

73
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:11,285
after a tumultuous 13 years
of our on-again/off-again affair

74
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,690
or whatever it was...

75
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,237
my mom told me to come out...

76
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,296
hey, no pun intended...

77
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,035
to California.

78
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:33,479
It's warm.

79
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:34,605
It's sunny.

80
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:36,775
Everyone's friendly.

81
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:40,081
Everyone's happy, happy, happy.

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,648
So I brought my dark self
out to the Wild, Wild West.

83
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,864
What's this?

84
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,132
It's a California blintz...

85
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,332
avocado and sprouts.

86
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,803
It's good for you.

87
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:09,442
Forget about that woman.

88
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:10,676
She has had a hold on you

89
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,082
for too long.

90
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,380
She loves you;
she hates you.

91
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,786
She's gay; she's bi;
she's God-knows-what.

92
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:19,155
And every time she calls,
you come running.

93
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:22,628
Mom, enough.

94
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:25,597
Okay, okay.
Who am I anyway?

95
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:27,099
Just your mother.

96
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,303
Do you want me ask
some of the other PFLAG mothers

97
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:33,464
about their daughters?

98
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:35,633
I mean, maybe you could meet
one of them.

99
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,664
No, Mom.

100
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,610
Thanks, really.

101
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,169
I appreciate your concern,

102
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,239
but I can handle
the dating thing myself.

103
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,218
Well, you don't seem to be
doing such a hot job

104
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,015
by yourself.

105
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,852
Ah, it's none of my business.

106
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,049
Anyway,
you'll start out

107
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,028
all over again here, fresh.

108
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,359
You'll see.

109
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,490
You'll love it here.

110
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,228
And it's about time
you settled down

111
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,701
with a nice girl.

112
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:08,006
I'd like to write your address
in my address book

113
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,736
in pen, not pencil.

114
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:10,936
Mom.

115
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,969
Well, I never heard of anybody
moving around so much.

116
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,608
Okay, okay,

117
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,617
I won't say anything.

118
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:20,016
You have to live
your own life.

119
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,851
Thank you.

120
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,151
One thing, though.

121
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,983
The Gay Pride Parade
is tomorrow.

122
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,358
Your father and I

123
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,657
will be carrying
the banner

124
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,927
for the PFLAG
contingent.

125
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,695
It's a big honor.

126
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:39,535
It would be very nice if...
if you could march with us.

127
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,268
I don't know, Mom.

128
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:45,402
Well, it would mean a lot
to your father.

129
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,308
I'll think about it, Mom.

130
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,720
Well, you do what you feel,

131
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,747
but I think
it would be nice

132
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:02,592
if the family could do
something together.

133
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,430
(Rachel)
I realized my mother's
entire retirement career

134
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:11,233
rested on my sexual orientation.

135
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,535
Well, I was just glad
someone was getting something

136
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,700
out of my sexual orientation.

137
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,869
Everyone needs a hobby.

138
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:29,854
So you'll come?

139
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:46,136
(Rachel)
But, you know,
I adjusted to California.

140
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,265
I found some friends
who understood sarcasm.

141
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:53,507
I learned that in clothing,
layering was rarely an option.

142
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,275
I explored the lighter,
brighter side

143
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,306
of the color spectrum.

144
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,978
But it struck me
all my friends were male.

145
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:04,046
Gay, straight...
but of the male variety.

146
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,650
Ultimately my identity
as a gay female

147
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,992
hinged on me finding
another female to be gay with,

148
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,964
otherwise the whole membership
thing was in jeopardy.

149
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,934
I was still a member
of the tribe,

150
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:20,963
but my family status
might be put into question.

151
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,443
My friends, however fun,
were of limited use.

152
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:25,466
So what about
that girl

153
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,001
Steve set you up with?

154
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,139
Oh, that was a no go.

155
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:30,979
What was the problem
this time?

156
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,314
She was just too tan.

157
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:33,478
What?

158
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,919
She had that
healthy-leathery-skin-

159
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:37,513
bordering-on-skin-cancer
look.

160
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,218
Mmm, sounds attractive.

161
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,022
See, my goal used to be
meeting someone

162
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,493
who was
psychologically sound.

163
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:43,688
That's a lofty goal.

164
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,426
Well, this, I realized,
was asking for far too much.

165
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,026
Now I'm just hoping
for not completely psycho.

166
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,366
This also could be asking
for too much.

167
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,371
Listen.

168
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,963
You might
have to settle.

169
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,998
Everyone has to settle.

170
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,404
Except me, of course.

171
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,607
Oh, Norman,

172
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,109
you've always been
my knight in shining armor.

173
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:09,087
Rachel, sweetie,
tell me...

174
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,384
is your apartment
still done

175
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:13,358
in early American
moving boxes?

176
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,954
Well, maybe.

177
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:18,623
You know, Rach,
girls usually like it

178
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,633
if they feel you're gonna
stick around for a while.

179
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,157
Have you got
any furniture yet...

180
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,361
I mean,
besides that table

181
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,337
that props up
your word processor?

182
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:26,633
Hey, don't scoff.

183
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:29,073
I process words
to keep food on the table.

184
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,668
Actually, more accurately...

185
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,736
to keep food
on the moving box.

186
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,180
Besides, none of you
will go antiquing with me.

187
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,513
Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel,

188
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,610
we'll never
marry you off.

189
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,245
Mama,
enough already

190
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,846
with the marriage talk.

191
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,585
A mother can dream.

192
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,624
(Rachel)
Once more unto the breach,
dear Rachel, once more.

193
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:51,630
Thanks.

194
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:53,928
You're welcome.

195
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:57,300
(Rachel)
Rachel continues her pursuit
of Ms. Rightowitz.

196
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,614
(woman)
Wow, hey.

197
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,638
You must be Rachel.

198
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,277
Hi, I'm Kathy,
Bobby's friend.

199
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,479
Um, well, actually,

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,388
Bobby's roommate Oarl's
sister's friend.

201
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,187
I'm sorry I'm so late.
L...

202
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,955
I just lost track
of the time.

203
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,326
Do you want anything
to drink?

204
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,728
I'll just have
some hot water.

205
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,268
I brought my own herbs.

206
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:36,506
So I was sharing with my ex,
you know...

207
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,170
just ordinary stuff,
you know,

208
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:42,079
like what we needed
from the store

209
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:47,644
and, um, whose turn it was
to do laundry.

210
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:54,820
And then our sharing
got more intense.

211
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,795
(Rachel)
What is this "share" bit?

212
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,889
When did the word tell
become such a taboo?

213
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,628
What is wrong with just telling
somebody something?

214
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,159
Is it somehow less sincere?

215
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:06,432
So I shared with her

216
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:09,066
that I felt perhaps she was
needing something

217
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:13,169
that I couldn't
or was not able to give her

218
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,770
at the present time.

219
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:18,045
You know,
I just wanted her to feel

220
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,917
that she could share with me,

221
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,944
if she felt comfortable,

222
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,480
whatever she was going through...

223
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,016
of course, in her own time...

224
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:34,057
and I wouldn't at all
be judgmental.

225
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,968
We all have our own space.

226
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,404
She was sleeping
with someone else?

227
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,930
Well, yeah.

228
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:48,277
(Rachel)
I got to know that cafe
very well.

229
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,941
There was Debi.

230
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:52,780
She'd mistaken my pasty-white
New York City skin color

231
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,652
for a fellow member
of the Gothic tribe.

232
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,180
I corrected her impression.

233
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,886
Then there was Suzi.

234
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,724
She loved surfing...

235
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,195
a lot.

236
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,494
And certainly
it was fascinating for me

237
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,160
to hear her describe
her surfing experiences...

238
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,194
in detail.

239
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:13,830
Then I met Teri.

240
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:16,706
She served in the Navy
for seven years.

241
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,040
I don't know if anyone
asked or told,

242
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,536
but I certainly
wasn't going to.

243
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,777
I was getting
a little desperate.

244
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,217
I just wanted to meet someone
without an "e" sound

245
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:28,880
at the end of her name.

246
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:32,152
I actually let my mother
set me up with a girl.

247
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:34,853
I still find this sad and scary.

248
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,293
But there you go.

249
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,856
Loneliness is a dangerous thing.

250
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,925
Basically I knew
she had blonde hair,

251
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,130
she was slim,
and she'd be wearing...

252
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:53,006
This is a Swedish nightmare.

253
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,103
(woman)
Rachel?

254
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,114
Yeah?

255
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,139
Hi, I'm Christine,
your mom's friend.

256
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,083
(Rachel)
Friend?

257
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,450
Now I'm going out
with my mother's friend?

258
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,512
When will this madness end?

259
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,717
Iced tea, please.

260
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,129
I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

261
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,133
Oh, no, I got here
about five minutes ago.

262
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,293
I hate being late.

263
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,632
I hate the idea
of keeping people waiting.

264
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,968
Oh, so you're not
from California.

265
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:24,306
No, no, I was born and raised
in San Diego County.

266
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,140
What's that have to do
with being on time?

267
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,443
Well, don't they revoke
your California residency

268
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,470
if you're too punctual?

269
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,676
Well, if they do,

270
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,413
I've managed to slip past
the system so far.

271
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:38,149
So how long have you been
in California?

272
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,751
Well, I guess it's been
nine months now.

273
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,852
Practically a native.

274
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,193
I don't think
that could ever happen,

275
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,755
even under threat
of torture.

276
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, is living in California
so bad?

277
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,727
Try not to get
into an argument.

278
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,103
Well, it's different.

279
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,735
How is it different?

280
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,039
(Rachel)
Be diplomatic.

281
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,808
Well, just do your best.

282
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,405
Well, people
are less direct here.

283
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,417
In what way?

284
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,079
Well, they never really
tell you what they want.

285
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,315
I mean, they go over here;
they go over there,

286
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,880
you know,
and I feel like...

287
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,794
You know, people are so busy
trying not to offend anybody,

288
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:17,625
they never really
say anything.

289
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,756
And in New York,

290
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,199
people tell you
exactly what they want?

291
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,135
At 100 decibels.

292
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,831
That sounds pleasant.

293
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,566
If people here
weren't so passive

294
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,598
and nonaggressive
in their conversations,

295
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,075
maybe there'd be
less road rage.

296
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,202
Ever thought of that?

297
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,907
Have you ever been
in a cab in New York?

298
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:39,878
Okay, point well taken.

299
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,443
When were you in New York?

300
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:42,818
Oh, I haven't been.

301
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,823
I just watch Law and Order
a lot.

302
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:49,021
Oh, well,
that's practically the same.

303
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:56,429
I hate to jinx it, but, um,

304
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,164
I think this is going okay.

305
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,105
I would say so.

306
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,342
Well, when I first started
going out with my ex,

307
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,216
she only played softball
on the weekends.

308
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,777
And then she got
really into it.

309
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,153
She set up this pitching mound
in the backyard,

310
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,987
and she nearly killed
the neighbor's cat

311
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:21,823
with a wild pitch.

312
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,624
Eventually
she went professional.

313
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,255
Now she travels
all over the country

314
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:26,265
playing softball.

315
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,425
That's incredible.

316
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:30,367
Yeah, well, she's doing
what she loves.

317
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,337
What's the name
of her team?

318
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:33,736
Xena's Warriors.

319
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,173
Oh, I should have known.

320
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,608
Must get lots of coverage
on ESPN.

321
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:39,872
Right.

322
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,278
So what about your ex?

323
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,374
Uh,

324
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,544
she left me
for her gynecologist.

325
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,745
Wow.

326
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:48,754
Yeah.

327
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,278
No competing there.

328
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,347
God, that's weird.

329
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,187
Yeah, I should have
seen it coming.

330
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,853
No one needs a Pap smear
once a week.

331
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,795
How long had you
been together?

332
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,797
The last time?

333
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,696
What do you mean,
"the last time"?

334
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,758
Well, we kind of
went out and broke up

335
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,202
and went out and broke up
a few times.

336
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:07,000
How many times?

337
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,301
Four of each.

338
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,832
Going out and breaking up,
I mean.

339
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,002
Wow.

340
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,773
Well, I think this one
will stick.

341
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,405
I sealed it
by moving cross-country

342
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,473
and not leaving
a forwarding address.

343
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:20,076
I stopped short of putting
an obituary in the paper.

344
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,916
I thought that might be
tempting fate.

345
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:24,320
She sounds like
quite the tornado.

346
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,188
More like a hurricane...

347
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,522
Hurricane Reggie.

348
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,323
Reggie?

349
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,330
Like in the Archies?

350
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,229
Actually,
it's short for Regina.

351
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,165
She was named
for the Bette Davis character

352
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,327
in The Little Foxes.

353
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:39,361
[Imitating Bette Davis]
Oscar, you should know me

354
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,463
well enough by now

355
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,996
to know that I don't ask
for things

356
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,872
I don't think I can get.

357
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:47,310
Well, that's impressive...

358
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,109
the quote,
not the imitation.

359
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:50,615
Thanks.

360
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:52,640
You know,
I love classic movies.

361
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,949
See, even Californians
can have a sense of history,

362
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,852
even if it is only
Hollywood history.

363
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,858
But my Dad has this amazing
video library,

364
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,826
if you ever want
to borrow something.

365
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,257
So your, uh, ex was named
for Regina Giddens?

366
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:07,663
Yeah, scary, huh?

367
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,497
It was strangely prophetic.

368
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,662
Reggie is quite
the cutthroat.

369
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,604
Whatever Reggie wants...

370
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,936
Reggie gets?

371
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,768
Yeah, she's not coming back
to reclaim you, is she?

372
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,972
Uh, you never know,

373
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:24,073
but, uh,
not if I can help it.

374
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:28,913
Well, this is
where I live.

375
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:31,149
Oh, cute house.

376
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,090
Thanks.

377
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,251
How long
you lived here?

378
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,194
Um, two years now.

379
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,060
Wow, time flies, huh?

380
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:40,759
When you're having fun
or not.

381
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,789
Yeah.

382
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,930
I had a great time tonight.

383
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,498
Yeah, me too.

384
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:53,842
Would you like to get together
again sometime?

385
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:57,007
That'd be great.

386
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:01,419
Could I see you
in the morning?

387
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:04,252
That'd be even better.

388
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:26,141
(Rachel)
Private Rachel Rosen
awoke alone in the jungle.

389
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,203
She was unaware
of the danger she was in

390
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,738
and who had removed
her clothing.

391
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,410
She decided to stay put

392
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,978
until she ascertained
more information.

393
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,717
A native entered
bearing sustenance.

394
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:41,886
Or was it?

395
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,299
You know,
all last night,

396
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,733
I felt like there were
lots of tiny green eyes

397
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:50,928
staring at me,

398
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,403
and I swear, at one point,

399
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,906
I even heard some tittering.

400
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,965
Now, I thought it might be
the neighbors,

401
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:59,000
but now I understand.

402
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:01,740
Do you have something
against plants?

403
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,008
No, I just kill them,

404
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:04,447
but I never mean it.

405
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:05,848
It's involuntary man-,

406
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,580
I mean,

407
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,588
plant-slaughter.

408
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:12,056
Well, try not to kill mine.
I really like them.

409
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,218
I can see that.

410
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,228
So do you have any plans
for today?

411
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,321
Other than reading
the Sunday New York Times,

412
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:20,127
I'm basically available.

413
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,068
What'd you have
in mind?

414
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:26,594
Well...

415
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:35,370
I hope you're kidding.

416
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,642
No. What size do you wear?

417
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,149
Seven.

418
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:39,844
Well, it just so happens
so was my ex,

419
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,046
and since she abandoned
all other sports

420
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,419
when she dedicated her life
to softball,

421
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:47,823
I believe these babies
have your name on them.

422
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,497
Great.

423
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,411
Come on, Rachel!

424
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,355
No, no, you go on ahead.

425
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:22,991
What's the matter?

426
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,155
It just violates

427
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,858
one of my principal rules
of dating:

428
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:28,491
Try not to look
like a complete idiot

429
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:29,501
on the first date.

430
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:31,400
This isn't
our first date.

431
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:32,768
Last night
was our first date.

432
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,739
Don't you know
that for lesbians,

433
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,365
a date is a 24-hour thing?

434
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,807
What kind of lesbo are you?

435
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,470
Come on.
I'll help you.

436
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:40,739
Oh, this is not
a good thing.

437
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:41,746
Yeah, it is.

438
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,747
No.

439
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:37,025
Hey, Joe, guess what.

440
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,331
[Joe over telephone]
What?

441
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,962
I met a nice girl.

442
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:41,029
Impossible.

443
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,234
No. By golly, it's true.

444
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,505
How could this have happened?

445
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:48,240
Well, it's very embarrassing
for me to admit it,

446
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,009
so I'm sure you'll enjoy this.

447
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,041
She's actually the girl
my mother set me up with.

448
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,313
You're kidding.

449
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:55,320
I kid not.

450
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,254
Well,

451
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,723
come on...
details, details.

452
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:00,725
Well,

453
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,193
her name is Christine.

454
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:06,197
Oh, a nice Jewish girl.

455
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:09,860
She's a massage therapist,
and she laughs at my jokes.

456
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,369
[Singing]
Say hallelujah.

457
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:12,700
Can I get a witness?

458
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:13,727
Anyway,

459
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:15,467
I'm gonna try
to really behave myself

460
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:16,701
and not screw this up.

461
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,937
Hmm, that would be different.

462
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,137
Thanks, Joe.

463
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:22,010
You know how much
your support means to me.

464
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,810
What are friends for?

465
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,552
(Rachel)
I don't know how it is
for you heterosexuals,

466
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:32,023
but in the gay world,
exes never die.

467
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:34,582
They simply fade into friends...

468
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,355
very concerned friends,

469
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:37,987
friends who feel
they have the right

470
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,295
to interfere in your business.

471
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,893
So the official committee
of my ex-girlfriends

472
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,369
and various sundry friends

473
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,304
would not permit Christine

474
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,740
to have the official title
of "my girlfriend"

475
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:54,303
until she passed
their examination.

476
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:00,140
Do you describe yourself
as "gay" or "lesbian"?

477
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,153
I-I go either way.

478
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:05,416
That's just unacceptable.

479
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,948
I don't think
that's a good an...

480
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:10,860
No, no, I mean,
I use either word.

481
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,027
It says here
on your application

482
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,499
that you're
still friends

483
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:16,831
with your
ex-girlfriend.

484
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,394
Yes, that's true.

485
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,463
Mm-hmm.

486
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:23,532
If you were to fill out
a job application,

487
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,941
would you use
aforementioned ex-girlfriend

488
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:29,175
as one of your
emergency contact persons?

489
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:30,841
No, of course not.

490
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,814
I like that.

491
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:39,153
Is she still
on speed dial?

492
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:42,456
Oh, good question.

493
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,825
Good question.

494
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,831
No, I hardly talk to her.

495
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,425
She isn't a potential stalker,
is she?

496
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,163
Of me?

497
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,262
Or Rachel.

498
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:56,297
No, her... her softball schedule
is way too intense.

499
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,865
And off season?

500
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,641
No.

501
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,648
Anan,
what do you think?

502
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:04,649
Did you like her?

503
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,413
Well...

504
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,728
(Rachel)
Oh, she passed...

505
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,460
barely.

506
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:28,536
A year passes,
and they fall deeply in love.

507
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:29,836
Trust me.

508
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,277
Do I look okay?

509
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,338
Yeah, you look great.

510
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:11,849
Why are you so nervous?

511
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:13,715
I've just never been
to a seder before.

512
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:14,719
It's no big deal.

513
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:16,345
It's just
the Jewish Thanksgiving.

514
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,856
Only you have to sit through
a long story at the beginning

515
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:19,983
while the food gets cold.

516
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,084
I just... I just don't want
to say anything wrong

517
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,185
and embarrass myself.

518
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:26,220
Don't worry about it.
You'll be fine.

519
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:27,755
Hey.

520
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,469
Oh, and here's
the happy couple.

521
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:37,304
Oh, and don't you both
look beautiful?

522
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:40,243
Come in.
Come in.

523
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,246
Hi, Mom.

524
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,474
Oh, hi, baby.

525
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:43,481
Hi, Mom.

526
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,813
(Rachel)
Did she call her "Mom"?

527
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:48,149
Come. I want to introduce you
to everybody.

528
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:53,087
Of course, you know
Matthew and Carol.

529
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,092
Nice to see you.

530
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,093
Hi, Christine.

531
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:56,094
Hi.

532
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,028
And this is Nancy
and Cindy.

533
00:26:58,063 --> 00:26:59,394
Hi, Christine.
How you doing?

534
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:00,398
It's nice
to meet you.

535
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:01,558
Nice to meet you.

536
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,195
And this is Steve
and Barry.

537
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:07,205
Barry comes
to PFLAG meetings.

538
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,206
Hi.

539
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,639
Hi, guys.

540
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:12,143
Oh, and, of course, Sam.

541
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,077
Hi, Sam.

542
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:16,910
(Carol)
Jacob, honey!

543
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,974
Okay, everybody,

544
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:22,248
it's time for us to start
the festival of freedom

545
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:26,553
for all our GLBT
loved ones.

546
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,041
(Barry)
"The wise son asked,

547
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:47,477
"'What is the meaning
of the rules, laws, and customs

548
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:50,208
"which the Eternal, our God,
has commanded us? '

549
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:52,580
"'You shall explain to him
all the laws of Passover,

550
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:55,347
to the very last detail
about the Afikoman. "'

551
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:58,546
"The contrary son asks,

552
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,717
"'What is the meaning
of this service to you? '

553
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,556
"Saying 'you,'
he excludes himself."

554
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:04,755
"Rabbi Yehuda used to refer
to the ten plagues

555
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:06,388
"by their Hebrew initials:

556
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,366
D'Tzach, Adash, B'Achav."

557
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,575
"Rabbi Jose
the Galilean said"...

558
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:18,576
Honey,

559
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,908
it's pronounced "Yosi."

560
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:24,347
The "j" is said like a "y."

561
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,317
Oh.

562
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:29,047
This didn't happen
in Mexico.

563
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:31,578
It's okay, dear.
How could you know?

564
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:32,612
Go on.

565
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:40,392
"Rabbi Jose
the Galilean said:

566
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,161
"'How can one show that,

567
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,930
"'following the ten plagues
in Egypt itself,

568
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,198
"'the Egyptians

569
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,832
"were smitten with 50 plagues
at the Red Sea? '

570
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,437
'They suffered 200."'

571
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:32,714
Very nice, dear.

572
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:34,082
Welcome to the family.

573
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:46,291
This is Sam's
and my ketubah.

574
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:49,494
It's actually
a wedding contract.

575
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:50,626
It's beautiful.

576
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,571
It's a very old tradition
of the Jewish people.

577
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:56,938
Matthew and his wife
have one,

578
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,535
Barry and Steve have one,

579
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:02,138
and I hope one day,

580
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,045
my Rachel will have one too.

581
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:13,724
Rach?

582
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:14,725
What?

583
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,817
How's it going?

584
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,352
Oh, fine.

585
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:19,658
Fine.

586
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,359
Adjusting to California?

587
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:22,366
What?

588
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's great.

589
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,596
Work's okay?

590
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:26,763
Well, it comes and goes,

591
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:29,968
but I'm getting enough
to keep me out of trouble.

592
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:33,500
Certainly has been
an informative seder this year.

593
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:34,910
Excuse me?

594
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,140
Well, I didn't know

595
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:37,808
that the lost tribe
of the Israelites

596
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,477
was actually
the GLBT tribe.

597
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,851
Our mother is just a fountain
of knowledge.

598
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:44,014
You know, she tells me

599
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,852
she's not going to use
the word straight

600
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,119
for heterosexuals anymore.

601
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,751
Now she says
I'm "nongay."

602
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,055
You go, girl.

603
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:51,357
She gets
any more accepting,

604
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:53,694
I'll have to rebel
and go straight.

605
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,962
Oh, I mean, nongay.

606
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:58,060
The only time
she ever calls me anymore

607
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,331
is when she wants my opinion

608
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:01,202
on some article
she's written for PFLAG.

609
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,206
Well, you see?

610
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,229
This is the price you pay

611
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:05,835
for choosing
the heterosexual lifestyle.

612
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,902
New research proves
that heterosexuality

613
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:09,880
is biologically based.

614
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:10,973
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:12,506
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

616
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,950
I barely see Mom myself.

617
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,385
She's far too busy
being supportive.

618
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,582
Go, team, go.

619
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:19,681
Exactly.

620
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,715
Look at this over here.

621
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,388
Christine is sure a change
from that Reggie.

622
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,627
Yup, she sure is.

623
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,761
How are things
between you two?

624
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,828
Fine.

625
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,033
What's the matter, Rach?

626
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,905
Nothing.

627
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,774
That was convincing.

628
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:45,010
Come on.
Tell your big brother.

629
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,541
She called Mom "Mom."

630
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:48,848
So what?

631
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,650
You should be glad
she gets along so well

632
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:51,656
with the family.

633
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,658
Yeah, I'm thrilled.

634
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:54,989
What's the matter?

635
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:56,550
I thought you wanted
a girlfriend.

636
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,324
Well, yeah,
I wanted a girlfriend,

637
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,888
not a wife.

638
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,797
I mean,
look at them together.

639
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:06,736
(Matthew)
I think it's nice.

640
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:07,738
Oh, Carol.

641
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:08,739
Hey, look.

642
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:10,070
It's the first wives club.

643
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:12,838
That's not funny, Matt.

644
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,180
(Nancy)
What should I do
with these?

645
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,017
Oh, just put them
on the counter, I guess.

646
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,181
Can I give you a hand?

647
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:28,351
Oh, no, I just snuck in
to try to finish up.

648
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:29,417
Um, Nancy,

649
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:30,985
can I ask you a question?

650
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:32,826
Yeah, sure.

651
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,491
Were you born Jewish?

652
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:37,262
Oh, yeah,
I've always been Jewish.

653
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,668
I only became African American
ten years ago.

654
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,466
I'm sorry.
I converted ten years ago.

655
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,475
Really?

656
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:45,476
Yeah.

657
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,239
I was never really religious
growing up,

658
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,578
and when I went to college,
my first girlfriend was Jewish.

659
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:53,049
I started going to Friday night
services with her,

660
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,483
and on the holidays,

661
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,079
we'd go together
to her parents' home.

662
00:32:57,122 --> 00:32:58,180
It was really nice.

663
00:32:58,223 --> 00:32:59,747
Wow.

664
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,089
So how did your parents
take your conversion?

665
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:05,426
Well, my mom was worried,

666
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,090
because I had already
come out to her,

667
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:10,533
and she thought,
"Well, okay, you're black"...

668
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,535
And this is before

669
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,264
"African-American"
came into vogue.

670
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:16,297
"You're a lesbian,
and now you're Jewish.

671
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:19,139
You're going to have to start
your own support group!"

672
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:22,010
Is, um, Cindy
also Jewish?

673
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,344
No.

674
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:26,578
It's hard enough finding one
African-American Jewish lesbian.

675
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,677
Two would be
bucking the odds.

676
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:34,422
I really enjoyed
the seder.

677
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,553
I like the whole idea
of a festival of our freedom.

678
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,859
Do you all get together
every year?

679
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,695
What did you say?

680
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,791
What's the matter, hon?

681
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,802
You've hardly said a word
the whole way home.

682
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:45,803
Nothing. I'm...

683
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,099
I'm just tired.
That's all.

684
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,299
Well, you just seem
kind of quiet.

685
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:59,344
No, no, I'm fine.
It's just been a long day.

686
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,981
What's that you said
about the seder?

687
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:09,892
Well, I was just saying
that it really struck me,

688
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:13,694
you know, the idea that we were
all once strangers in Egypt

689
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:15,666
and that we should
remember that

690
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,190
and treat the strangers
among us

691
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,465
with dignity and justice.

692
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:23,201
Yeah, I don't think God knows
about trickle-down economics.

693
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:28,243
Rach,

694
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:31,009
how hard is it
to become a Jew?

695
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:34,212
What do you mean?

696
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,447
Well, I don't know anything
about conversion.

697
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,615
You can convert to Judaism,
can't you?

698
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:41,454
Well, yeah,

699
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,791
but we never really
been big on that.

700
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:45,420
People usually
have trouble enough

701
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,488
without adding the burden
of Jewdom.

702
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:49,466
Rach, I'm serious.

703
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,594
I thought you'd be happy
that I would think of it.

704
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:53,536
Happy?

705
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:54,697
Well, you know,

706
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,833
that we could share holidays
together as a family.

707
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:01,642
Well, you were there tonight.

708
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,011
You didn't have to convert.

709
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:09,680
I mean, you and me
as a family.

710
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:14,024
Oh.
[Swallows]

711
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:15,616
Well...

712
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,820
What's the matter, Rachel?

713
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:20,297
Do you not want me
to convert?

714
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,196
I didn't say that.

715
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,723
Well, you hardly
seem enthused.

716
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,828
I just don't think
it's necessary.

717
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,963
Not necessary?

718
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:29,234
Yeah.

719
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:31,538
I don't want you to convert
just because I'm Jewish.

720
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:34,374
That's not why I want
to convert.

721
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:37,040
So why do you?

722
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:41,074
For one thing,
just for myself,

723
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,919
because it strikes
a chord in me.

724
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:49,325
But also because I think
ceremonies like tonight

725
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,558
could help bring us
closer together,

726
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:58,058
and I want to build
a home with you.

727
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,036
I want to build
a family with you.

728
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,270
Oh.

729
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:05,435
Well...

730
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:06,944
What's the matter, honey?

731
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:09,446
You're not having doubts
about us, are you?

732
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,881
No, of course not.

733
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,043
It's just I find
this idea of converting

734
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,019
a little stunning.

735
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:18,614
Well, I didn't say it
to upset you.

736
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:20,920
Oh, I know, babe,

737
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:24,224
and if you want to convert,
I mean...

738
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:26,389
well, that's great.

739
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,228
I just don't want to think
you're doing it

740
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,460
just because I'm Jewish.

741
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,629
No, honey,

742
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,264
that's not why.

743
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:38,969
Okay.

744
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,276
Do you think I could ask
your mother's rabbi about it?

745
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:44,440
Sure.

746
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:50,147
Then when we retire,

747
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:51,553
we can move to Miami
together.

748
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:56,151
It would be the fulfillment
of a life's dream.

749
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:05,235
Oh, honey, you know,
I meant to ask you.

750
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,704
When I was, um, putting away
the serving dishes,

751
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,503
I noticed some old photos
of your family in the drawer.

752
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:15,206
Who was the other little girl
in them?

753
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:17,510
Uh, that was my sister.

754
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:18,880
Your sister?

755
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,853
You never mentioned
you had a sister.

756
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:26,414
She died when I was 13.

757
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:29,119
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

758
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,991
Yeah.

759
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:31,996
Well.

760
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,158
What did she die of?

761
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,134
Uh, car accident.

762
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:41,104
A drunk driver went through
a red light.

763
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:43,004
Oh, my God.

764
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,010
Yeah.

767
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:53,882
I really don't want
to talk about it.

Please.

770
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:03,153
I'm sorry.

00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:08,527
Listen, I'm...
I'm gonna do some work.

Parents, Friends, and Families
of Lesbians and Gays...

778
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:32,378
have organized
yet another protest

779
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:35,586
against the initiative
which would make it a state law

780
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:39,028
that marriage is only valid
between a man and a woman.

781
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:45,226
I have a gay daughter
and a nongay son.

to have the same rights

to marry and commit to a partner
as my son.

This is Kelly Neill

in Hillcrest
for Channel 2 News.

786
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:03,845
Hey, have you ever thought
that you'd like to get married?

787
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,749
Aaahhhhhhh!

788
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,886
You know, when I first
told my mom I was gay,

789
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:12,520
I told her
one of the advantages was,

790
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:13,996
at least she wouldn't
have to pay

791
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:15,124
for an expensive wedding.

792
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,327
Now, of course,
she'll just be tickled lavender,

793
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,563
and I know somehow
she'll manage to get it featured

794
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:21,299
on every local
and national newscast.

795
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:22,670

Do you think Christine
was really serious about it?

798
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,613
Oh, yeah, and there is
no stopping that woman

799
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:31,239
when she sets her mind
on something.

800
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:32,374
Well, why not get married?

801
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,475
Why not?

802
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:34,485
Well, I mean,

803
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:37,113
she is madly in love with you,

804
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:40,022
and I am emphasizing "madly."

805
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,525
And you've led me to believe

806
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,823
that you're not
completely indifferent to her.

807
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:45,055
Okay, I love her.

808
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,222
I think she's great.

809
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:49,199
She loves me, which I give her
immense credit for.

810
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:51,133
But, you know,
I have squirming room.

811
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:53,103
The U-Haul is just a call away.

812
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,332
Marriage is that's it.

813
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,238
I believe
that's the idea.

814
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,436
Okay, I know no one
takes gay marriage seriously,

815
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:02,605
but gay marriage is still
like a real commitment.

816
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,706
I believe that's why
it's known in the gay world

817
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,478
as a commitment ceremony.

818
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,178
You and Danny
never got married.

for nine years.

822
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:15,791
So why don't you get married?

823
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,294
I don't know.

824
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:19,523
Maybe gay men
naturally find it easier

825
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:21,828
to commit to long-term
relationships.

826
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,061
You know how I feel
about commitment.

00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:00,009
Listen, I got to go out.

899
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,780
I'll be back in an hour or so.

900
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:03,343
What's the matter?

901
00:44:03,387 --> 00:44:04,581
Nothing, nothing.

902
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:06,886
I just got to get some air.

903
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:56,439
Rachel?

904
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:58,669
Where have you been?

905
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:00,904
I was just out walking
by the bay.

906
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:05,238
You've been gone
for four hours.

907
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:07,182
I thought maybe
something had happened.

908
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:10,619
No, no, I just lost track
of time.

909
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:12,417
Sorry.

910
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:16,516
Do you want to break up?

911
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,221
No, of course not.

912
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:20,196
I just get the sense lately

913
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:22,062
that you don't want
to be around me.

914
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,468
Oh, no, honey.
It's... it's just...

915
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:28,404
l...

916
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:31,465
You know, maybe it's
a midlife crisis.

917
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,807
You're 34.

918
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:37,302
I've always been advanced
for my age.

919
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:38,679
I need you to talk to me.

920
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:41,583
I feel like
you're shutting me out.

921
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,845
Christine,

922
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:47,449
you are the best thing
that ever happened to me,

923
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,051
and I'm not letting you go.

924
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:53,393
I want to be with you.

925
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:57,263
And I want to be with you.

926
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:02,432
I'm trying, honey.
I'm really trying.

927
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:04,202
It's just...

928
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:06,607
I have a problem
making commitments.

929
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:08,703
Well, that's why I can't shop
at the price club.

930
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:10,373
The quantities
are too large.

931
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:14,111
I can't even commit
to a product.

932
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:17,712
We don't have to figure
all the future out today.

933
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:20,019
We can take one day at a time,

934
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:23,083
but I want to take
every one of them with you.

935
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:25,425
You foolish, foolish girl.

936
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:26,896
I'm serious.

937
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,365
I know.

938
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,027
And there's no one
I'd rather be with.

939
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:33,935
So what's the problem?

940
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,899
There is no problem.

941
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:46,011
So you really want
to get married?

942
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,577
I think it could be nice,
don't you?

943
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,212
Do I get a bachelor party?

944
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:56,016
Only kidding, honey.

945
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,960
Only kidding.

946
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:02,791
(Rachel)
Then it was time for dinner
with the parents.

947
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,529
The brisket
is great, Mom.

948
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,400
Yes,
it's delicious.

949
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:08,666
Thank you.

950
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:10,139
It's Sam's
mother's recipe.

951
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:15,202
So, Leah, tell us
about this PFLAG thing

952
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,737
you do.

953
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:21,148
PFLAG is the only nongay
gay activist group

954
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:22,880
in San Diego County.

955
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,115
Excuse me.

956
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:27,716
Did you say "nongay"?

957
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:29,191
Yes, yes.

958
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:31,558
I don't like
the word straight.

959
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:35,031
I think it makes it sound
like to be heterosexual

960
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:38,523
is correct
and anything else is crooked.

961
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:40,696
How interesting.

962
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:43,104
Just what does PFLAG do?

963
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,075
Some parents
have a problem

964
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,738
dealing with their kids
being gay.

965
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:50,371
I can't imagine.

966
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:51,881
(man)
Dear.

967
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:55,852
(Leah)
So parents come to PFLAG
for support and,

968
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:57,877
we hope,
eventually come to acceptance

969
00:47:57,922 --> 00:48:00,618
of their children as they are...

970
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:02,785
beautiful human beings.

971
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,953
(man)
Well, that sounds great.

972
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,122
Maybe we should go
sometime, dear,

973
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:10,099
and show our support.

974
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:11,863
Oh, that would be wonderful.

975
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:13,870
So many kids
come to our meetings

976
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:15,599
whose parents
have rejected them.

977
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,937
It's great for them
to talk to parents

978
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:22,036
who accept
their GLB T children.

979
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,446
I'm sorry..."GLBT"?

980
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:28,246
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual,
and Transgendered.

981
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:32,153
Oh... gelbt.

982
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:35,522
(man)
So, Sam,
do you play golf?

983
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,220
I belong to a wonderful club

984
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:38,285
in North County.

985
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:40,661
I try to get out
as often as I can.

986
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:42,290
You should come along sometime.

987
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,131
I mean, well,
we're practically family now.

988
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:48,627
How do you feel
about your daughter

989
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:50,799
converting?

990
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,502
That must be hard for you.

991
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,476
Converting to what?

992
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:01,814
Oh, my God.

993
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:02,910
Oh, my God,

994
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:04,580
did I say something
I shouldn't have?

995
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:07,352
Now, that would be unusual
for you, Mom.

996
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:11,118
(man)
Pumpkin,

997
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,526
is this true?

998
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:18,824
Um, yes, Dad, it's true.

999
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:21,064
I'm, um,

1000
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,437
taking conversion classes,

1001
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:24,998
um, to convert to Judaism.

1002
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:31,807
And in November,
we will be married by a rabbi.

1003
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:37,547
Well, my goodness,

1004
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:41,888
so much to absorb
in one evening.

1005
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:43,187
Mom, I'm sorry.

1006
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:46,788
I should have told you before.

1007
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,730
You know, darling,

1008
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:51,826
you're making
this unflappable image of mine

1009
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:52,836
harder and harder

1010
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,269
to maintain.

1011
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:55,397
Mom.

1012
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:56,804
Seriously, darling,

1013
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,832
sometimes I think
you only do these things

1014
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:01,845
to see if you can
make me crack.

1015
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:06,248
Mom, it's got nothing
to do with you.

1016
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,114
Well, let me tell you
something, darling.

1017
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:09,119
I am a WASP,

1018
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:11,883
a full-fledged,
card-carrying WASP,

1019
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:15,358
and so are you,
as much as you fight against it.

1020
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:19,089
And as a WASP,
I refuse to break down

1021
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:21,393
in front
of perfect strangers...

1022
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:24,026
no offense intended.

1023
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:25,899
None taken.

1024
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:28,496
Mom, there are some things
that happen in this world

1025
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:30,666
that have nothing
to do with you.

1026
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:34,735
They are few and far between.

1027
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:35,938
(man)
Honey, what I think

1028
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:36,946
you meant to say

1029
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,504
was that we support you,
Christine,

1030
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:41,916
no matter what you do.

1031
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:45,183
Oh, of course.

1032
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:47,190
But tell me, dear.

1033
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:49,692
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

1034
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,821
but I don't think you can have
the name Christine

1035
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:54,353
and be Jewish.

1036
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:58,232
So what should your father
and I call you now?

1037
00:50:58,268 --> 00:50:59,633
Meshuggener.

1038
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,100
Rachel!

1039
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:06,609
Rach.

1040
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:09,077
(Christine)
You ready, Matt?

1041
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:10,375
(Carol)
Jacob, it's yours!

1042
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:11,506
(all)
Whoo!

1043
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:13,379
(Rachel)
All right.

1044
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,384
He's good.

1045
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:15,385
He's getting better.

1046
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:17,216
So, um,

1047
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:19,154
are you getting excited
about the wedding?

1048
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:22,681
Actually,
much to my surprise, I am.

1049
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:25,251
I'm developing a new attitude.

1050
00:51:25,295 --> 00:51:26,592
Really?

1051
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,927
Yeah.

1052
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:31,196
I try to focus on the present
in short-term spurts,

1053
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:33,601
'cause thinking long-term
freaks me out.

1054
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:37,198
Uh, you know, Rachel,
most people think of marriage

1055
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:39,334
as a kind of long-term thing

1056
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:41,344
even if it hardly ever
makes it there.

1057
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:42,811
Yeah, yeah, I know,

1058
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:45,440
but I'm trying to pull the wool
over that part of my brain.

1059
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:47,279
Anyway, I'm going
full steam ahead

1060
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,478
no matter what my inner child says.

1061
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,284
Actually, Rachel, with you,

1062
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:55,723
it's more of an outer child
kind of thing.

1063
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:57,158
How true.

1064
00:51:57,194 --> 00:52:00,163
And, of course,
you love Ohristine.

1065
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,164
Well, yeah.

1066
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:03,257
I can't believe
she puts up with me,

1067
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,029
but for some reason,
she does.

1068
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:08,231
All shiksas
want a Jewish husband.

1069
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,330
(Christine)
It's out!

1070
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,342
Okay, come here.

1071
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:13,343
Here's the idea.

1072
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:16,005
Christine is really great
with the kids.

1073
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:19,948
Yeah, she is, isn't she?

1074
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:22,713
You two ever talked
about having kids?

1075
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,649
Having kids for what?

1076
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:27,281
You know what I mean.

1077
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,656
Do you two want to make babies?

1078
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:32,161
Well, I been trying my best
for more than a year now,

1079
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:34,221
and no results as of yet.

1080
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:37,165
Can you answer a question
without being flippant?

1081
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:39,999
I shall certainly try.

1082
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:42,335
We never really
talked about it.

1083
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:45,773
I stand corrected...
or rather... sit corrected.

1084
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:48,573
Christine has on occasion
alluded to it,

1085
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:53,242
but I cleverly avoided
the topic.

1086
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:54,716
So suppose she does.

1087
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:57,117
I guess it's not
such a bad idea.

1088
00:52:57,154 --> 00:52:59,088
(Christine)
This is for the championship.

1089
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:00,146
You ready,
Jacob?

1090
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,757
(Rachel)
Come on.
Come on, girl.

1091
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:02,818
Whoo!

1092
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,827
Attagirl!

1093
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:05,089
Sorry, Jacob.

1094
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:07,596
Hey, Matt, you know,
I guess you just can't beat us.

1095
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,168
So, Matt, has my little woman
beat you again?

1096
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:13,226
It's not fair.

1097
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,669
She's a native Californian.

1098
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:17,435
Being good at outdoor sports
is in their DNA.

1099
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:18,805
I think you'd be
more gracious

1100
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:19,809
about losing, Matt.

1101
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:20,810
You do it so often.

1102
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:21,902
(Matthew)
Christine,

1103
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:23,276
you're not allowed
to abuse me

1104
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:24,940
until we've actually
become family.

1105
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:26,449
You're supposed
to be polite now.

1106
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:28,713
(Carol)
Don't you listen to him,
Christine.

1107
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:31,516
Feel free to abuse him
all you want.

1108
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:32,954
It makes him strong.

1109
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,288
(Matthew)
Honey, you're supposed to be
on my side.

1110
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:38,761
Hey, all bets are off
since our Pictionary debacle.

1111
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,387
Ah!

1112
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,419
Speaking of which...

1113
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:42,727
(Matthew)
Forget it, Rach.

1114
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,859
One humiliation
in front of a man's progeny

1115
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:47,268
is enough.

1116
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:48,566
No more Pictionary.

1117
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:49,833
Maybe one
or two more.

1118
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:54,807
I'm exhausted.
I'm going straight to bed.

1119
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:55,834
Me too.

1120
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,148
[Woman over answering machine]
God, you're hard to track down.

1121
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:08,749
It's Reg, if you haven't
figured out by now,

1122
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,316
but I haven't seen you
in so long,

1123
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,225
maybe you've forgotten.

1124
00:54:12,262 --> 00:54:15,663
Anyway, I just wanted
to hear your voice.

1125
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:19,829
I hope you're okay
and surviving California.

1126
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,269
"Christine and Rachel

1127
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:23,398
can't answer the phone
right now"...

1128
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,704
I guess you are doing okay.

1129
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:27,642
Anyway, call me.

1130
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:28,645
You know the number.

1131
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,737
Hey, any calls?

1132
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,714
Uh, just the editor
about some corrections.

1133
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,375
I need to call him back, okay?

1134
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:34,645
Sure. Love you.

1135
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:35,879
Love you too.

1136
00:55:15,592 --> 00:55:17,719
[Reggie over telephone]
Hello.

1137
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:19,194
Hello.

1138
00:55:19,229 --> 00:55:20,196
Hey, Reg.

1139
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,721
Oh, my God, Rachel!

1140
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,028
How you doing?

1141
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:25,967
Simply fabulous.

1142
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:26,992
There you go.

1143
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:28,561
Where the hell have you been?

1144
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:31,369
And when did you move
to California?

1145
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,399
I mean, I know I'm awful,

1146
00:55:33,443 --> 00:55:36,469
but you shouldn't have to run
so far away.

1147
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:38,879
I got out here
more than a year and a half ago.

1148
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,405
Has it been that long?

1149
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,384
I'm afraid it has.

1150
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:43,716
Oh, don't be afraid, sweetie.

1151
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:45,847
Just accept it for what it is.

1152
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:49,086
I didn't wake you up, did I?

1153
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:51,356
Oh, what's the matter
with you, Rach?

1154
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:54,057
You know me.
I'm a night owl, baby.

1155
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:56,258
Oh, how silly of me.

1156
00:55:56,299 --> 00:55:58,563
What is it out there, 10:00?

1157
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:00,297
I know that's late
for Californians.

1158
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:03,363
You're all a bunch
of pagan sun worshippers.

1159
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:05,034
Now, Reg, you know
you shouldn't talk

1160
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:06,599
about religion or politics.

1161
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:09,703
Speaking of religion,
how's your mother?

1162
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:11,907
Taking over the world.

1163
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:14,473
Does she still spit
when she says my name?

1164
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:16,884
I think she's blocked you out.

1165
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,047
So easily forgotten.

1166
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:22,718
No one could ever forget you,
Reg.

1167
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:26,058
If only that were true.

1168
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:28,121
Uh, so what's going on, Reg?

1169
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:30,099
How's it going with Marc?

1170
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,998
Oh, he's long gone.

1171
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:33,593
Boring.

1172
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:37,198
No, little Reg
is all by herself.

1173
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,572
I find that hard to believe.

1174
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,440
You always have
the next one lined up.

1175
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:42,740
Well, it's true.

1176
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:46,977
So who's this Christine
that you're shacking up with?

1177
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:48,644
Is she the woman of your dreams?

1178
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:50,482
Well, we've been
seeing each other

1179
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,044
for more than a year now.

1180
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:54,250
You moved in together.

1181
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,657
Well, you know lesbians
don't understand the concept

1182
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:58,354
of dating
without living together.

1183
00:56:58,395 --> 00:56:59,760
How true.

1184
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:01,730
So is it serious?

1185
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:04,131
No, we often joke around.

1186

Rachel, try to stay on point.

1187
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:08,671
Well, I'm not seeing
anyone else.

1188
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:10,400
So it is serious.

1189
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,409
Well, yeah.

1190
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:15,035
It's like pulling teeth.

1191
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:17,410
It's not like
we don't have problems.

1192
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:19,381
What kind of problems?

1193
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,714
Just stuff.

1194
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:24,619
Jesus, Rachel, sometimes
having a conversation with you

1195
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:27,282
is like not having
a conversation with you.

1196
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:31,656
Actually, uh,

1197
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,391
we're talking
about getting married.

1198
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:36,399
Really?

1199
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:37,457
Yeah.

1200
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:38,832
Oh.

1201
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:40,063
You never asked me.

All those years together?

1204
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:47,208
Actually,
I-I think she asked me.

1205
00:57:47,244 --> 00:57:49,474
Really?

1206
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:52,243
Listen, Reg, uh,
I got to get going.

1207
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:53,613
Okay, darling.

1209
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:56,115
Yeah?

1210
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:58,644
You know I'm still
in love with you.

1211
00:57:58,688 --> 00:57:59,848
I thought it was over,

1212
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:05,089
but I think about you
all the time.

1213
00:58:05,128 --> 00:58:08,757
Yeah.

1214
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,290
I got to get going.

1215
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:14,303
I'll... I'll talk to you
real soon.

1216
00:58:14,337 --> 00:58:17,795
Good-bye, honey.
Kisses.

[Woman singing]
What you gave me,

1218
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:24,208
what you stole

1219
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:30,550
can't hold a candle
to the things you'll never know.

1220
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,817
Fate, a fool could find.

1221
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:35,347
Words, I would waste.

1222
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:37,019
When there's nothing
in this world

1223
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,459
that will make you mine

1224
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:41,760
and there's nothing
to take your place,

1225
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:45,598
does it matter what I say?

1226
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:48,832
Does it matter what I do?

1227
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:52,239
Does it matter
what I tell myself

1228
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:55,711
when what I want is you?

1229
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:58,236
What I want

1230
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:01,216
is you.

1231
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:03,685

Is everything okay?

1232
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,687
What?

Oh, yeah.

1236
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:10,886
It wasn't a big deal.

1237
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:11,916
Oh, good.

1238

Oh, hey,

00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:15,861
um, your mom wants us
to get together

1240

sometime next week
to start planning the wedding.

1241
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:20,465
When would be good for you?

1242
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:22,300
Oh, whenever.

1243
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:24,034
You schedule
whatever's best for you.

1244
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:25,939
Is Wednesday okay?

1245
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:28,877
Sure.

1246
00:59:28,912 --> 00:59:30,243
She wants Carol
to be there,

1247
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,578
and she also wants to see
if Barry and Steve can come,

1248
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:34,777
'cause they got married
last year.

1249
00:59:34,818 --> 00:59:36,615
Great.

will be fun, don't you?

00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:41,785
Oh, yeah.

1252
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:50,090
Rachel, you schmuck.

1253
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:52,727
What the hell is wrong
with you?

1254
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:54,669
I don't know.

1255
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,638
She sounded so sad,

1256
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:59,267
and then she said
she was still in love with me.

1257
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:02,039
Yes, and of course
you believed her,

1258
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:03,272
because up till now,

1259
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:06,805
she's been so straightforward
and honest with you.

1260
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,249
Well, she sounded sincere.

1261
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:12,619
Rachel, this woman's
a piranha.

1262
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:15,625
And you, my friend,
are a little guppy.

1263
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:16,626
Joe...

1264
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,423
No, no, not even a guppy...

1265
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:21,089
the unfertilized egg
of a guppy,

1266
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:23,531
the twinkle in an eye
of a guppy.

1267
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:24,533
Okay, Joe.

1268
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:26,501
I can't believe you,
Rachel.

1269
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:27,867
Maybe Rob is right.

1270
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:30,498
Maybe you don't really want
a relationship.

1271
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,007
What do you mean?

1272
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:34,306
It seems to me that you're
actually trying to screw up

1273
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:36,107
your relationship
with Ohristine.

1274
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:37,613
Hey, it's not my fault.

1275
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:38,978
Reggie called me.

1276
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:41,040
It has nothing to do
with Reggie.

1277
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:42,483
What are you saying?

1278
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,316
I am saying that you're
always gonna look

1279
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:45,719
for a reason not to commit,

1280
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:47,882
and if it's not Reggie,
it'll be something else.

1281
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:49,755
That's not true.

1282
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:52,489
Do you understand
how lucky you are

1283
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:54,258
to have met Ohristine?

1284
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:55,958
Of course.

1285
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:59,833
Well, do you understand
that if you run after Reggie,

1286
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:02,064
eventually she's gonna
break your heart again,

1287
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,834
and in the process
of pursuing her,

1288
01:01:03,873 --> 01:01:05,773
you'll lose Christine?

1289
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:10,337
Joe, whatever your theories
about Reggie,

1290
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,508
I know I can't even
look at her photo

1291
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:17,179
without having a crisis.

1292
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:21,714
I ache
just when I hear her voice.

1293
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:22,952
And, yeah,

1294
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:25,018
I know it's partly because
I just miss New York

1295
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:29,191
and people who can sustain
a conversation.

1296
01:01:29,232 --> 01:01:31,393
But part of it is her.

1297
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:33,766
And Ohristine?

1298
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:37,068
[Sighs]

1299
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:40,440
Joe, I don't know what to do.

1300
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:43,071
She's everything to me.

1301
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:44,341
Rachel,

1302
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:48,681
you have a wonderful woman

1303
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:52,518
with whom you can build
a beautiful life.

1304
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:56,013
Think about what she means
to you,

1305
01:01:56,059 --> 01:01:59,358
how she's always there
for you.

1306
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:02,229
Forget about Reggie.

1307
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:03,823
She's just an excuse.

1308
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:07,030
She's just a fantasy.

1309
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,268
Ohristine is real.

1310
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:16,039
Now, you can hire
a wedding consultant

1311
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,046
to plan the wedding,

1312
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,877
but they're expensive,

1313
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:20,815
and really
you want to do it yourself

1314
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,909
to make sure you get
exactly what you want.

1315
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:25,477
Have you decided where you're
going to have the ceremony?

1316
01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:26,489
Well, honey,

1317
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:28,150
you know
you could have it here,

1318
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:31,888
but our patio's so small,
you couldn't have many guests.

1319
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:33,259
Don't be silly, Leah.

1320
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:34,888
We'll have it at our house

1321
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:35,989
in the backyard.

1322
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:37,260
Are you sure, Oarol?

1323
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,961
Of course.

1324
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:39,969
That's so great.
Isn't that great, Rachel?

1325
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:41,994
Yeah, it's incredible.

1326
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:44,063
(Steve)
Have you two decided
what you're going to wear yet?

1327
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:46,632
I thought about a hot little
off-the-shoulder thing,

1328
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:47,802
maybe leopard skin.

1329
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:50,278
Oh, Rach, you are
such the little kidder.

1330
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:53,539
Actually,
we haven't decided yet,

1331
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:54,845
but we both agree...
no tuxes.

1332
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:56,112
Thank God.

1333
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:58,279
You, on the other hand, Oarol,
will be in tails.

1334
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:00,482
Uh, maybe we'll be busy
that weekend.

1335
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:02,252
Where are you gals
gonna register?

1336
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:04,760
Xena. Com.

1337
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:06,091
Just ignore her.

1338
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:07,096
Seriously, Rachel,

1339
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,688
where do you think
we should register?

1340
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:13,930
Lacroix, sweetie,
Lacroix.

1341
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:26,238
[Telephone ringing]

1342
01:03:32,755 --> 01:03:33,722
Hello.

1343
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:35,451
[Water running]

1344
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:37,084
Hi, Rachel.

1345
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:38,617
Reg?

1346
01:03:38,661 --> 01:03:40,788
It is I, my furry friend.

1347
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,422
How you doing?

1348
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:44,228
Well, pretty well,

1349
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:45,734
except for that God-awful
flight,

1350
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:47,565
but I don't know
any other kind of flight.

1351
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:49,231
Flight?

1352
01:03:49,272 --> 01:03:50,830
Where are you?

1353
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:53,809
San Diego, my love.

1354
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:57,074
If Mohammed
will not come to New York Oity,

1355
01:03:57,113 --> 01:04:00,446
then New York Oity
shall come to Rachel.

1356
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:02,974
You're in San Diego?

1357
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:04,748
Yeah, sweetie,
that's what I just said.

1358
01:04:04,787 --> 01:04:06,152
Has senility set in already?

1359
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:09,586
I can't believe you're here.

1360
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,218
Me too.

1361
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:12,455
And here you are.

1362
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:14,395
It certainly warms
the cockles of my heart

1363
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,263
to be welcomed so warmly
in the Sunshine State.

1364
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,598
No, no, Reg,
that's Florida.

1365
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,831
California's the Golden State.

1366
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:22,929
Oh, that's right.

1367
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:24,997
They count votes here.

1368
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,668
I'm sorry, Reg.

1369
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:29,007
I just didn't expect you
to come here.

1370
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:31,206
Well, I have.

1371
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,078
They let me on planes now.

1372
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:34,083
So when do I see you?

1373
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:35,880
Shall I come over there?

1374
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:37,147
No.

1375
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,417
Um...

1376
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:42,253
Do you want to come
to my hotel room?

1377
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:45,693
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1378
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:48,697
Listen, I'll meet you
at this coffee shop,

1379
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:50,323
uh, the Living Room.

1380
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:52,664
I'd rather meet you
in another room.

1381
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,636
Reg, focus.

1382
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,366
Where is it?

1383
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:59,375
It's, um, in Hillcrest
on University Avenue.

1384
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:01,775
Do you think you can find it?

1385
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:04,575
When? Now?

1386
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:05,876
Yeah, okay.

1387
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:08,213
Just give me an hour
to finish up here, okay?

1388
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,310
Whatever you want, my love.

1389
01:05:10,353 --> 01:05:11,718
I'll see you there.

1390
01:05:11,754 --> 01:05:15,349
I'll have a rose in my teeth
in case you don't recognize me.

1391
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:17,791
Yeah, sure.

1392
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:19,454
I'll see you there.

1393
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,540
Hey, Reg.

1394
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:11,206
Rachel!

1395
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,242
Let's take a look at you.

1396
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:19,812
Just as cute as ever.

1397
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:21,016
Reg, you look great.

1398
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:22,752
And I am.

1399
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:26,795
So, Reg, um,
what's going on?

1400
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:27,887
Just the usual...

1401
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,125
keeping my head
above the water.

1402
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:33,465
It's so strange to see you
after all this time.

1403
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:37,269
Just a little worse
for wear and tear is all.

1404
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:42,702
Reggie,

1405
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:44,372
why are you here?

1406
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:47,906
I've come to fetch you home.

1407
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,719
What?

1408
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,779
I miss you, Rachel.

1409
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,950
I want you home with me.

1410
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,996
You... you can't say that to me.

1411
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:05,091
I already have.

1412
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:08,626
But I live here now.

1413
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,730
I'm gonna marry Christine.

1414
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:13,367
No, you're not.

1415
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:14,967
Yes, I am.

1416
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:17,479
Oh, come on, Rachel.

1417
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:20,346
I know you still love me.

1418
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:21,816
I can tell
just by looking at you.

1419
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:23,113
I know you too well.

1420
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,151
I love Christine.

1421
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:30,421
No, you love me,

1422
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,394
and you're gonna marry me.

1423
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:36,723
And now you're gonna kiss me.

1424
01:09:10,793 --> 01:09:12,886
(Christine)
Rachel.

1425
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:41,219
(Leah)
More, more, more!

1426
01:10:00,109 --> 01:10:02,407
(Reggie)
Do you want to come
to my hotel room?

1427
01:10:02,445 --> 01:10:05,346
(Rachel)
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1428
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:20,995
I'd like to make a toast.

1429
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,793
To Christine,

1430
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:27,030
whose Hebrew name is now
Karen bat Avraham Avinu.

1431
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:28,036
L'Chaim!

1432
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,334
(all)
L'Chaim!

1433
01:10:30,373 --> 01:10:31,533
Way to go, Christine.

1434
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:33,371
Welcome to the tribe.

1435
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:34,569
(man)
Congratulations,

1436
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,577
sweetheart.

1437
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:36,873
Thank you.

1438
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:39,108
I-I appreciate
all the support you've given me

1439
01:10:39,148 --> 01:10:40,775
over the past six months.

1440
01:10:40,816 --> 01:10:42,443
Christine, darling,
we still hold on

1441
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:44,214
to our parental rights,
don't we?

1442
01:10:44,253 --> 01:10:45,242
You'll still come by

1443
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:47,518
when we're eating
through straws?

1444
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:49,821
Mother, stop that.

1445
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,486
I'm only asking, dear.

1446
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:53,256
Of course she will.

1447
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:57,096
She's a wonderful daughter
and a terrific person.

1448
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,290
(Carol)
Rachel,

1449
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,360
you're being strangely silent.

1450
01:11:01,404 --> 01:11:04,134
You can't be out
of witty repartee.

1451
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:05,731
I'm just absorbing
the profundity

1452
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:07,242
of this awesome experience.

1453
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:10,006
(man)
I'd like to make a toast
to my daughter.

1454
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:11,013
Well, Pumpkin,

1455
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:13,641
you never cease to amaze me.

1456
01:11:13,683 --> 01:11:17,141
Whatever you set out to do
gets done.

1457
01:11:17,186 --> 01:11:19,518
Now, I've never been
a religious man,

1458
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:22,490
but I am so proud of you,

1459
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:26,222
and I wish you
all the happiness in the world.

1460
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:29,561
Thanks, Dad.

1461
01:11:29,599 --> 01:11:32,329
So you're going to make
my daughter an honest woman.

1462
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:34,393
Well, not being one myself,

1463
01:11:34,437 --> 01:11:36,268
I thought I'd give it a try
with Christine.

1464
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:38,773
We're very attached
to her, you know,

1465
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:41,936
so behave yourself.

1466
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:45,414
Yes, ma'am.

1467
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,115
Hey, hon.

1468
01:11:54,156 --> 01:11:55,714
It's Sky.

1469
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:57,851
She has to reschedule
her massage appointment.

1470
01:11:57,893 --> 01:11:59,383
Her inner child's in town.

1471
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:00,725
Oh, thanks,
honey.

1472
01:12:00,763 --> 01:12:02,924
Can you grab the mail for me?
I'm loaded with stuff.

1473
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:04,455
Sure.

1474
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:29,582
Hey, anything interesting?

1475
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:33,686
(Rachel)
Now, what would be
your definition of interesting?

1476
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,458
Come on.

1477
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:46,068
[Woman singing]
I don't know
what it means...

1478
01:12:46,108 --> 01:12:48,668
Sorry I'm late.

1479
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:51,805
I been running around
trying to cram everything in.

1480
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:53,144
That's all right, dear.

1481
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:54,979
I can't stay long.

1482
01:12:55,017 --> 01:12:56,848
I have to pick up the dress
in an hour.

1483
01:12:56,886 --> 01:13:00,083
Any attention you pay
your dear old mother

1484
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:01,589
is greatly appreciated.

1485
01:13:01,624 --> 01:13:03,615
Mother.

1486
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:05,889
Well, I guess
I ought to get straight... -

1487
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:08,294
sorry... nongay

1488
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,298
to the point.

1489
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:14,792
This is your grandmother's
wedding ring.

1490
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:18,363
I want you to have it.

1491
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:21,467
I know you already have rings,

1492
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,137
but being it's
your grandmother's...

1493
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:24,771
It's beautiful.

1494
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:27,442
Of course,
it's not rainbow colors,

1495
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:29,849
but I believe
it works the same.

1496
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:32,752
Mom, are you sure?

1497
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:33,812
Yes.

1498
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:36,484
Well, you seem
bound and determined

1499
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:38,993
to test my abilities to adapt.

1500
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:41,019
And I can, you know.

1501
01:13:41,063 --> 01:13:45,397
And the Rosens seem like
perfectly lovely people, so...

1502
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:47,493
I knew you'd like them.

1503
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:50,403
Rachel seems okay too.

1504
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:53,704
Thanks, Mom.

1505
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:58,146
She has the driest
sense of humor...

1506
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,149
very important
in a daughter-in-law.

1507
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:04,084
I'm proud of you, Mom.

1508
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:08,523
Well, I'm quite proud
of you, too,

1509
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:10,957
my little rebel.

1510
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:18,395
Oh, I'm sorry.

1511
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:19,423
Christine.

1512
01:14:19,468 --> 01:14:20,492
Rob!

1513
01:14:20,536 --> 01:14:22,367
I was just thinking about you
the other day.

1514
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:23,928
What's all this?

1515
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:25,770
Oh, just a bunch of stuff
for the wedding.

1516
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:27,366
It's coming down to the wire.

1517
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:28,842
Oh, that's right.
So when's the lucky day again?

1518
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:30,539
Sunday.

1519
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:33,480
Oh, so that's why Reggie's
in town.

1520
01:14:33,516 --> 01:14:34,642
What?

1521
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:36,048
Reggie's in town?

1522
01:14:36,085 --> 01:14:38,246
You didn't know?

1523
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:39,254
I think it was her.

1524
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:41,756
Of course, I've only
seen her in photos.

1525
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
Of course.

1526
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:45,053
I saw them the other day
at the Living Room.

1527
01:14:45,094 --> 01:14:47,085
I thought for sure you knew.

1528
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:48,926
Anyway, they didn't seem
to notice me.

1529
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:54,425
It looked like they were having
one intense conversation.

1530
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:55,437
I got to go.

1531
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:57,336
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1532
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:04,770
[Driving rock music]

1533
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:15,457
Where are you?

1534
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:18,585
Rachel!

1535
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:20,356
I'm here. I'm here.
What's the matter?

1536
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:22,125
Okay, Rachel,
what the hell is going on?

1537
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:23,961
Why didn't you tell me
Reggie was in town?

1538
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:24,966
Who told you that?

1539
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,467
Rob.

1540
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,697
He saw you having a t?te-?-t?te
at the Living Room.

1541
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:29,795
What's going on, Rachel?

1542
01:15:29,839 --> 01:15:31,636
She just came for the wedding.
That's all.

1543
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:32,641
Why didn't you tell me?

1544
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:33,767
I didn't want to upset you.

1545
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:35,003
So you're waiting

1546
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:36,978
till she showed up
at the wedding to upset me?

1547
01:15:37,012 --> 01:15:38,104
No, I was gonna tell you.

1548
01:15:38,147 --> 01:15:40,308
It was just with
the conversion ceremony and all,

1549
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:41,873
it didn't seem
like the right time.

1550
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:43,111
I don't like this.

1551
01:15:43,152 --> 01:15:44,949
I don't like you
keeping this from me.

1552
01:15:44,987 --> 01:15:46,386
I wasn't keeping it from you.

1553
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:48,720
I just wanted to find
an appropriate time to tell you.

1554
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:50,691
Oh, and just when
would that have been?

1555
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:53,995
Okay, I was nervous
about telling you

1556
01:15:54,029 --> 01:15:55,963
because exactly
what's happening now.

1557
01:15:55,998 --> 01:15:58,330
You know how much
I hate confrontations.

1558
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:00,699
But her coming here
doesn't change anything.

1559
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:02,101
Believe me, it doesn't.

1560
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:05,129
I really don't know
what to believe.

1561
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:08,007
Well, you can believe me
when I tell you

1562
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:11,809
it doesn't change anything
that Reggie's here.

1563
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:14,281
Don't do this again.

1564
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:16,147
If you have something
like this to tell me,

1565
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:21,213
I want you to tell me
right away.

1566
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:24,351
Christine,

1567
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:26,793
I love you.

1568
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:28,729
I'm sorry.

1569
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:30,994
I should have told you
right away.

1570
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,729
I was wrong.

1571
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:36,203
I'm serious.

1572
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:38,832
I don't want you to keep secrets
from me again.

1573
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:40,102
It wasn't a secret.

1574
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:41,109
But you're right.

1575
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,078
I should have told you
right away.

1576
01:16:44,113 --> 01:16:46,673
But I love you.

1577
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:49,809
Okay?

1578
01:16:49,852 --> 01:16:51,945
Okay.

1579
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:02,396
So when do I get to meet her?

1580
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:03,420
What?

1581
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,795
Reggie...

1582
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:09,030
when will I get to meet her?

1583
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:12,939
Whenever you want.

1584
01:17:12,975 --> 01:17:16,206
How's tomorrow night
for dinner?

1585
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:18,110
Sure.

1586
01:17:18,147 --> 01:17:20,843
I'll give her a call.

1587
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:22,373
Good.

1588
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:26,378
So what do you do again,
Reggie?

1589
01:17:26,422 --> 01:17:29,118
I'm a professor of physics
at Columbia University.

1590
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:31,149
What's that, like P. E?

1591
01:17:33,896 --> 01:17:37,093
Yes, I teach dodgeball.

1592
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,727
Oh, I think it was
Woody Allen who said,

1593
01:17:40,769 --> 01:17:43,932
"Those who can't do teach,

1594
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:47,875
"and those who can't teach

1595
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,605
teach physics."

1596
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:53,581
I believe he was referring
to gym teachers.

1597
01:17:53,615 --> 01:17:55,344
My mistake.

1598
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:57,249
And what is it that you do,
Christine?

1599
01:17:57,286 --> 01:18:01,086
I'm a massage therapist.

1600
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:05,287
You know, I don't believe
they teach that particular art

1601
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:06,954
at Columbia.

1602
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:10,227
Or would that be a science?

1603
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:13,098
Would anybody like anything
from the kitchen?

1604
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,330
No thanks, honey.

1605
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:18,306
Perhaps a little more wine,
sweetie.

1606
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:23,478
O-kay.

1607
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,811
So why are you here, Reggie?

1608
01:18:36,358 --> 01:18:39,521
I believe it's the cheese.

1609
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:40,858
Hmm.

1610
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:41,885
Now, you see,

1611
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,659
I thought it was
because of the Rachel.

1612
01:18:48,637 --> 01:18:52,073
You're a charming,
darling girl,Christine,

1613
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,438
but remember,

1614
01:18:53,475 --> 01:18:57,707
I can take Rachel from you
whenever I want.

1615
01:18:57,746 --> 01:19:01,079
You are a selfish,
arrogant girl, Reggie,

1616
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:04,517
but you even try,
and I'll snap you like a twig.

1617
01:19:12,194 --> 01:19:14,094
Oh, my goodness.

1618
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:16,222
Such language, Christine.

1619
01:19:16,265 --> 01:19:18,995
To quote my namesake
in The Little Foxes:

1620
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:21,400
"And I thought you were
all sugar water."

1621
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:24,668
Out the pretension, Reggie.

1622
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:26,537
You are no Regina Giddens.

1623
01:19:26,575 --> 01:19:28,543
You may think you eat the earth,

1624
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:31,011
but I will hardly stand around
and watch you do it.

1625
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:33,310
Really?

1626
01:19:33,348 --> 01:19:37,011
Well, Christine, F.Y.I.,
Rachel and...

1627
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:39,452
(Rachel)
Here's the wine.

1628
01:19:46,962 --> 01:19:48,953
Think I'll have some more
myself.

1629
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,838
How you gals
getting along?

1630
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,206
Fabulously.

1631
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:03,575
The best of friends.

1632
01:20:03,612 --> 01:20:05,671
[Softly]
Oh, great.

1633
01:20:13,288 --> 01:20:15,483
Great.

1634
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:26,898
She's a darling girl, Rach,

1635
01:20:26,935 --> 01:20:29,768
and quite the tigress
when it comes to you.

1636
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:31,966
She's no pushover.

1637
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:35,067
So you thought about
my marriage proposal?

1638
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,543
You weren't serious.

1639
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:38,671
Oh, yes, I was.

1640
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:40,477
Bought rings and everything.

1641
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:46,077
Well, Reg,
we enjoyed having you.

1642
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:48,646
You should come by again
next time you're in town.

1643
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,624
Yeah, I'll be sure
to do that.

1644
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:52,889
So long, Rach.

1645
01:20:52,928 --> 01:20:54,259
Bye, Reg.

1646
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:02,103
Okay, Dad,

1647
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:03,661
I finished
with the air filter.

1648
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:05,605
Do you need
anything else done?

1649
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:16,578
The wedding is Sunday.

1650
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:19,382
Everything seems
to be getting done.

1651
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:21,514
Here and there,
there are things to do, but...

1652
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:25,420
I'm just a little nervous.

1653
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,897
It's no big deal,

1654
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:32,059
except Reggie.

1655
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:38,796
I-I don't know what to do.

1656
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,367
Rachel, it's all gonna work out
for the best.

1657
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:44,845
What's that supposed to mean?

1658
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,906
Now, sweetheart, you know
you don't really love Reggie.

1659
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,850
You're just scared
of marrying Christine.

1660
01:21:49,885 --> 01:21:53,685
"I can't marry Christine.
I'm still in love with Reggie."

1661
01:21:53,722 --> 01:21:55,690
We both know
that isn't really true.

1662
01:21:55,724 --> 01:21:57,351
Oh, we do?

1663
01:21:57,392 --> 01:21:59,053
How can you be so sure?

1664
01:21:59,094 --> 01:22:01,324
'Cause I'm a lot older
than you.

1665
01:22:01,363 --> 01:22:03,456
You're too busy
running around

1666
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:06,228
to pay attention
to what's really going on.

1667
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:09,032
So what is going on,
O, Wise One?

1668
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:11,403
Well, the bottom line is,

1669
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,534
you have to stop
wasting your time waffling.

1670
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:16,544
Are you insinuating
that I am a waffler?

1671
01:22:16,578 --> 01:22:18,102
I most certainly am.

1672
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:19,807
You're my baby,
and I love you,

1673
01:22:19,848 --> 01:22:22,646
but you, my Rachel,
are a waffler.

1674
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:24,709
I'm devastated.

1675
01:22:24,753 --> 01:22:25,720
You're young.

1676
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:27,085
You'll get over it.

1677
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:29,386
If only I could be sure.

1678
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:33,053
Rachel, let me tell you
something.

1679
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:35,063
It might be a little hard
for you to hear.

1680
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:37,531
This isn't my sex talk, is it?

1681
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:38,533
God forbid.

1682
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:41,536
I want to talk to you
about your sister.

1683
01:22:44,873 --> 01:22:46,534
Oh.

1684
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:48,372
We never really
talked about it,

1685
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:52,073
but I think
we finally should.

1686
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:53,445
Why?

1687
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:56,883
'Cause you're a big girl now,
and it's time.

1688
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,016
All right.

1689
01:23:04,593 --> 01:23:06,823
I relive that day
so many times,

1690
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,330
everything about it.

1691
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:12,197
I said good-bye to Naomi
before she left for the game,

1692
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:15,795
and that was it.

1693
01:23:15,837 --> 01:23:18,465
She was just wiped away.

1694
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:21,100
Yeah.

1695
01:23:21,143 --> 01:23:25,045
All the worrying you do
for a child

1696
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,514
and the pride you feel
watching your child grow

1697
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:30,575
day by day, year by year.

1698
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:32,883
You invest all your life,
all your heart,

1699
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:40,623
and in a moment's inattention,
your child is gone.

1700
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:43,995
Never knew I could hurt
so badly.

1701
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:48,860
Yeah, me too.

1702
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,701
I know, honey.

1703
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:54,038
But, you know, over time,
I came to understand

1704
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:55,976
the measure of a life
is not in its length

1705
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:57,740
but in its quality.

1706
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:01,579
What quality my Naomi had.

1707
01:24:01,616 --> 01:24:05,177
How much she added to my life,
to our lives.

1708
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,586
I began to just feel grateful

1709
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:09,055
for the time we did have
with her,

1710
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,491
even though it was too short.

1711
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:12,857
What was I supposed to do,

1712
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:15,624
wish I had loved her less
so it wouldn't hurt so much?

1713
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:20,762
I never wanted to feel pain
like that again.

1714
01:24:20,802 --> 01:24:21,928
I know, honey.

1715
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:24,336
That's why
I'm telling you this.

1716
01:24:24,373 --> 01:24:26,341
When you told us
you were a lesbian,

1717
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:28,343
no, I did not
jump up and down for joy,

1718
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:30,641
but never for a moment
did I think,

1719
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,806
"You're not my daughter."

1720
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:33,940
I already learned

1721
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:36,109
that what you hold dear
to your heart

1722
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:39,018
can be taken away in a second,

1723
01:24:39,054 --> 01:24:40,612
so you just better love

1724
01:24:40,655 --> 01:24:43,021
and be grateful
for what you have,

1725
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:45,026
and pay attention.

1726
01:24:47,863 --> 01:24:50,832
[Softly]
I'm scared.

1727
01:24:50,866 --> 01:24:53,699
Honey, there is no way
to avoid getting hurt.

1728
01:24:53,735 --> 01:24:56,932
But unless you make
some commitments in life,

1729
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:58,667
unless you take
some responsibility,

1730
01:24:58,707 --> 01:25:00,436
you're not really living.

1731
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,409
You're only a shadow

1732
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:05,140
passing through.

1733
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:08,013
The last thing I want
is responsibility.

1734
01:25:08,049 --> 01:25:10,108
Honey, the more responsibility
you take,

1735
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,710
the freer you are.

1736
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:17,749
Everything becomes a choice.

1737
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:21,251
Naomi didn't have
much of a choice,

1738
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:22,627
did she?

1739
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:29,200
No, she didn't.

1740
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:31,501
But you do.

1741
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,601
And she wouldn't want to be
your excuse for not living.

1742
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:41,810
You know,

1743
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,750
I really loved her.

1744
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:45,480
I know, honey,

1745
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,353
and she knew.

1746
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,357
Yeah?

1747
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:51,621
Yes.

1748
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:02,294
Dad, how'd you get
so smart?

1749
01:26:02,337 --> 01:26:04,032
Public television.

1750
01:26:04,072 --> 01:26:05,369
It's a wonderful thing.

1751
01:26:05,407 --> 01:26:08,274
You see such interesting
programs.

1752
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,437
Now, you go get married

1753
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:13,642
and make me some more
grandchildren.

1754
01:26:13,682 --> 01:26:15,650
I'll see what I can do.

1755
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:34,263
Hello, Rachel, darling.

1756
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:36,998
Why the urgent call?

1757
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:38,505
Are we eloping?

1758
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,065
Do you want anything
to drink?

1759
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:42,474
Sure, I'll have a coffee.

1760
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:43,500
What's up?

1761
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:48,181
Listen, Reg...

1762
01:26:48,216 --> 01:26:51,743
I don't like the sound of this.

1763
01:26:51,786 --> 01:26:54,152
Reg,

1764
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:55,417
you know I love you and all,

1765
01:26:55,457 --> 01:26:57,254
and... and I guess I learned

1766
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:59,783
that I'm not
completely over you,

1767
01:26:59,828 --> 01:27:03,025
but I belong with Christine.

1768
01:27:03,064 --> 01:27:04,190
I love her.

1769
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,702
I don't want to be
without her.

1770
01:27:09,738 --> 01:27:11,296
Well,

1771
01:27:11,339 --> 01:27:13,534
such a dramatic little speech,

1772
01:27:13,575 --> 01:27:16,100
and me without my coffee.

1773
01:27:16,144 --> 01:27:19,443
I'm sorry, Reg,

1774
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:23,008
but it's really clear
to me now.

1775
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:25,383
My life is with Christine.

1776
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:30,690
So that's it?

1777
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:35,555
Yeah.

1778
01:27:41,002 --> 01:27:44,563
What am I supposed to do
with the rings?

1779
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:54,748
I'm sorry, Reg.

1780
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:58,918
It's because she's blonde,
isn't it?

1781
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:01,514
And a massage therapist to boot.

1782
01:28:01,556 --> 01:28:05,014
No benefits
being with a physics professor.

1783
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,584
Reg...

1784
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:08,755
I know it's not that, okay?

1785
01:28:08,797 --> 01:28:10,992
I'm just trying
to give myself an out

1786
01:28:11,032 --> 01:28:14,593
so I can leave gracefully.

1787
01:28:14,636 --> 01:28:19,266
But that's not really
an option, is it?

1788
01:28:20,976 --> 01:28:23,501
Reg,

1789
01:28:23,545 --> 01:28:27,140
you know I'll always love you

1790
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:31,482
in my own little way.

1791
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:34,511
Yeah, me too.

1792
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:40,627
So, um,

1793
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:42,459
you're not coming back
to New York?

1794
01:28:42,497 --> 01:28:44,556
You're gonna die out here.

1795
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:49,529
Don't know if I can, Reg.

1796
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:52,870
Our families are out here.

1797
01:28:52,907 --> 01:28:54,306
Never bothered you before.

1798
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:55,809
You're not, perchance,

1799
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:58,972
developing family values,
are you?

1800
01:29:00,982 --> 01:29:02,643
Perhaps.

1801
01:29:02,684 --> 01:29:05,118
PFLAG and all.

1802
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:07,451
Yeah,

1803
01:29:07,489 --> 01:29:11,255
Mama Leah.

1804
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:14,819
What are you going to do?

1805
01:29:14,863 --> 01:29:16,228
I don't know.

1806
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:18,755
I think, um, I should get back
to New York,

1807
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,792
hold on to a little dignity
and all.

1808
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:39,549
(Rachel)
Oh, my God!

1809
01:29:43,058 --> 01:29:44,320
Christine!

1810
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:46,452
Christine, hold up!

1811
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:47,483
It's not what you think.

1812
01:29:47,529 --> 01:29:49,019
I was telling her good-bye!

1813
01:29:49,064 --> 01:29:50,691
I was telling her
that I love you,

1814
01:29:50,732 --> 01:29:52,097
that I'm marrying you!

1815
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:55,034
Well, you can turn around
and tell her the wedding is off!

1816
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:56,298
I can't believe you, Rachel.

1817
01:29:56,337 --> 01:29:58,168
Do you have any respect
for me at all?

1818
01:29:58,206 --> 01:30:00,003
Of course I do.

1819
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:02,009
I feel so stupid!

1820
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:03,635
God, how she must have
laughed at me!

1821
01:30:03,678 --> 01:30:05,111
Damn you!

1822
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:07,205
I thought you loved me!
You told me you loved me!

1823
01:30:07,248 --> 01:30:09,375
I do love you.
I do want to marry you.

1824
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:10,884
Please... I know I've been stupid,

1825
01:30:10,919 --> 01:30:13,217
but please, please, marry me.

1826
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:16,154
Did you sleep with her, Rachel?

1827
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:21,453
Did you jump from our bed
to hers?

1828
01:30:21,496 --> 01:30:22,554
God, I am such an idiot!!

1829
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:23,586
Honey, please.

1830
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:25,189
I'll do anything.
Don't leave me.

1831
01:30:25,233 --> 01:30:26,700
Leave you?
What's wrong with you?

1832
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:27,827
You were just kissing her!

1833
01:30:27,869 --> 01:30:28,836
On the cheek!

1834
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:30,804
I was telling her good-bye!

1835
01:30:30,839 --> 01:30:32,397
I told her that I love you,

1836
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,840
that I'm not myself anymore
without you.

1837
01:30:34,876 --> 01:30:36,275
Who I am is tied with you.

1838
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:39,007
I can't be me without you.

1839
01:30:41,883 --> 01:30:44,215
So why, Rachel?

1840
01:30:44,252 --> 01:30:46,243
Why did you do this to us?

1841
01:30:47,589 --> 01:30:50,285
I don't know.

1842
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:52,657
I was afraid.

1843
01:30:52,694 --> 01:30:54,559
I was afraid
if I needed you too badly,

1844
01:30:54,596 --> 01:30:56,621
I would lose you.

1845
01:30:56,664 --> 01:30:59,155
I always had excuses
not to care too much

1846
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,668
so I wouldn't get hurt.

1847
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:04,103
It was my sister.

1848
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:05,868
It was Reggie.

1849
01:31:05,907 --> 01:31:11,777
Really, it was just me.

1850
01:31:11,813 --> 01:31:14,247
I just didn't want
to hurt anymore.

1851
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:17,750
I don't know
if I can trust you.

1852
01:31:17,786 --> 01:31:20,186
Christine, there hasn't been
anyone else.

1853
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:22,382
Reggie is, well, Reggie.

1854
01:31:22,423 --> 01:31:25,187
She just pushed
a lot of the right buttons

1855
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:27,353
from my past.

1856
01:31:27,395 --> 01:31:31,092
She was my excuse to run away
from making a commitment to you,

1857
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:32,861
because you are the one
that has touched

1858
01:31:32,901 --> 01:31:33,890
the deepest part of me,

1859
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,301
the person
that I'm most scared of

1860
01:31:36,337 --> 01:31:39,272
because you're the person
I'm most vulnerable to.

1861
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:41,241
But I needed Reggie
to come here

1862
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:44,507
to realize what I want
for my life.

1863
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:47,743
I want stop spending my life
just avoiding pain.

1864
01:31:47,782 --> 01:31:52,310
I've already wasted
too much time.

1865
01:31:52,353 --> 01:31:53,911
I want to start living.

1866
01:31:53,955 --> 01:31:57,857
And all I really want

1867
01:31:57,892 --> 01:31:59,917
is to live my life with you.

1868
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:04,058
I don't know, Rachel.

1869
01:32:04,098 --> 01:32:06,089
Honey, please.

1870
01:32:06,134 --> 01:32:08,329
I'll give you everything
that's inside of me.

1871
01:32:08,369 --> 01:32:13,102
I commit to you 100%

1872
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:15,939
You're the only one
that I want.

1873
01:32:17,278 --> 01:32:19,439
Rachel.

1874
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:22,278
Christine,

1875
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:24,512
marry me.

1876
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:30,886
Come on, honey.

1877
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:34,088
I'll keep a kosher kitchen.

1878
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:36,961
I'll go to services with you.

1879
01:32:36,998 --> 01:32:38,727
I'll knock you up.

1880
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:42,460
Promises, promises.

1881
01:32:42,503 --> 01:32:43,595
I mean it.

1882
01:32:43,638 --> 01:32:45,572
Wouldn't you like to have
a Rachel, Jr.,

1883
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:47,370
crawling around the house?

1884
01:32:49,143 --> 01:32:50,667
Well, I already have
a Rachel, Sr.,

1885
01:32:50,712 --> 01:32:51,872
crawling around the house.

1886
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:55,349
So you've had practice.

1887
01:32:57,151 --> 01:32:59,051
Marry me, Christine,

1888
01:32:59,087 --> 01:33:02,386
and I promise you all my heart.

1889
01:33:02,423 --> 01:33:06,189
I won't hold one iota
of me back.

1890
01:33:06,227 --> 01:33:08,058
You have me totally.

1891
01:33:10,498 --> 01:33:12,489
Oh, sounds immense.

1892
01:33:14,502 --> 01:33:16,436
But I think you should
get down on your knee.

1893
01:33:26,514 --> 01:33:28,539
Christine Peterson,

1894
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:33,646
otherwise known
as Karen bat Avraham Avinu,

1895
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:37,124
will you marry Rachel Rosen,

1896
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:41,026
otherwise known
as Leah Rosen's gay daughter?

1897
01:33:43,097 --> 01:33:44,621
I do.

1898
01:33:49,037 --> 01:33:53,064
Well, with the power
vested in me,

1899
01:33:53,107 --> 01:33:58,704
I most humbly and gratefully
take you

1900
01:33:58,746 --> 01:34:01,613
as my significant other.

1901
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:03,173
Amen.

1902
01:34:10,892 --> 01:34:13,986
And she bought it!

1903
01:34:14,028 --> 01:34:17,589
Oh, only kidding folks.

1904
01:34:17,632 --> 01:34:21,329
What do you think of the outfit?

1905
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:22,631
Oh.

1906
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,035
Thanks.

1907
01:34:27,008 --> 01:34:28,839
Well, I got to get going.

1908
01:34:50,598 --> 01:34:53,726
No more excuses.

1909
01:34:53,768 --> 01:34:55,929
V'Yasem Lecha Shalom.

1910
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:59,736
May the Lord bless you
and guard you.

1911
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:02,072
May the Lord show you favor
and be gracious to you.

1912
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:05,637
May the Lord show you kindness
and grant you peace.

1913
01:35:06,948 --> 01:35:07,915
Amen.

1914
01:35:07,949 --> 01:35:09,610
(all)
Amen.

1915
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:19,487
(all)
Mazel Tov!

1916
01:35:24,132 --> 01:35:27,226
(man)
Mazel Tov.

1917
01:36:02,703 --> 01:36:04,830
(all)
Proud of our gay children!

1918
01:36:04,872 --> 01:36:06,203
Mazel Tov!

1919
01:36:19,887 --> 01:36:22,014
You know,
I-I just wanted her to feel

1920
01:36:22,056 --> 01:36:23,546
that she could share with me,

1921
01:36:23,591 --> 01:36:26,526
you know, whatever she was
going through,

1922
01:36:26,561 --> 01:36:27,550
that... you know,

1923
01:36:27,595 --> 01:36:29,620
if she felt comfortable
to do so,

1924
01:36:29,664 --> 01:36:33,225
and I wouldn't at all
be judgmental.

1925
01:36:33,267 --> 01:36:35,235
I have a present for you.

1926
01:36:35,269 --> 01:36:36,258
This!

1927
01:36:38,306 --> 01:36:41,002
Yes, and you have
to wear it right now.

1928
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:42,236
Wonderful!

1929
01:36:42,276 --> 01:36:44,574
You look so beautiful!

1930
01:36:44,612 --> 01:36:46,045
Thank you, thank you!

1931
01:37:20,715 --> 01:37:21,841
Hi.

1932
01:37:21,883 --> 01:37:23,111
How you doing?

1933
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:24,277
I'm doing well.
