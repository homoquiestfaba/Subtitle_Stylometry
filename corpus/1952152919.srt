1
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,744
<i>There is one graduate here today</i>

2
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:47,619
<i>that has won every single honor
and award this school gives out.</i>

3
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:54,287
<i>That graduate,
our friend, is Van Wilder!</i>

4
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:18,448
<i>Standing here today,
l cannot help but wish l could stay</i>

5
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:20,543
<i>in high school forever.</i>

6
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,286
<i>l mean, there are
so many warm mammories...</i>

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,186
<i>Memories l have of this place.</i>

8
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,857
<i>But, you see, change, like life,</i>

9
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,566
<i>has a way of sneaking up on us.</i>

10
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:47,443
<i>When we least expect it, yeah.</i>

11
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,144
<i>Sure, the timing may seem
very, very bad,</i>

12
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:02,524
<i>but yet it feels good, so good,</i>

13
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,898
<i>to be graduating
with some of the sharpest minds</i>

14
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:12,268
<i>and swiftly darting tongues
that this school has to offer.</i>

15
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,840
<i>Listen to me ramble.
l am really giving you a mouthful.</i>

16
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:22,143
<i>But before l'm finished,
it is my extreme pleasure</i>

17
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:28,051
<i>to recognize someone who has aced
her oral exams,</i>

18
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,416
<i>who has always been head of the class,</i>

19
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:38,192
<i>graduating summa cum</i>

20
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:49,338
<i>laude. Our very own valedictorian.</i>

21
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:03,447
<i>Congratulations, graduates!</i>

22
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,696
-Congratulations, Son.
-Thanks.

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,166
Now, let's get out of here.
The sooner we get to Amsterdam,

24
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,760
the sooner we won't be able
to remember it.

25
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:18,929
Yeah.

26
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,376
-You're not going to Amsterdam.
-l can't.

27
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,312
Sheik Mohammad is building
an island outside of Dubai.

28
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:31,350
And l'm gonna help him
import a million tons of sand.

29
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:33,647
lt's a huge opportunity, Van.

30
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,450
Come on. You're gonna have
a great time without me.

31
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,787
Exploring nether regions
in the Netherlands

32
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:42,225
is not a bad way to spend
your summer before college.

33
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,991
l still don't know why l can't
just skip college and come work for you.

34
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,794
l mean, l know the business,
we could hang out...

35
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,563
Van, every Wilder man
has graduated from Coolidge.

36
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:54,903
lt's tradition. And tradition
is something you just don't break.

37
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,771
l gotta run. Hey, have a great time,

38
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,641
do everything l wouldn't do,
and remember,

39
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,807
-''Banging, broke or blitzed...''
-''A Wilder never quits.''

40
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,542
Write that down.

41
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:09,470
Well, well. Look who just arrived.

42
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,785
Van, do you have
to go back to the college?

43
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:26,257
Come back to Amsterdam with us.

44
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:32,532
Dulia, Babette, l'm sorry, ladies,
but l must.

45
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:46,471
l've been waiting 30 years for this.

46
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,191
lt's a little small, but l can work with it.

47
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,678
Van Wilder. l'm your new roommate.

48
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:28,080
All right. Farley.

49
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,385
Smoke?

50
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,463
Man, am l glad
we are roommates, man!

51
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,964
This place is a pimper's paradise.

52
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,900
l'm gonna make
some of my special brownies.

53
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:12,098
My God!
We've been invaded by Supercuts!

54
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,295
-Lieutenant Dirk Arnold, ROTC.
-Corporal Benedict, ROTC.

55
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,262
Van Wilder, WTF?

56
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,310
The Honorable Dean Charles Reardon
requests your presence immediately.

57
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,606
But l just put my slippers on.

58
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,481
Van Wilder, sir, as you ordered.

59
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,384
Return to your squad.

60
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,823
Well, well, Mr. Wilder.

61
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,656
Nice of you to join us.

62
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,286
Colonel Charles Reardon,
Dean, Coolidge College.

63
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,126
How's it hanging, Chuck?

64
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,257
You see these fine young men, Wilder?

65
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,028
These are Reardon's Raiders.

66
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:51,969
They've won every ROTC war game
for the past three years.

67
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,040
They're my pride and joy.

68
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:59,903
Good doggies.
l especially like your Chihuahua.

69
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:05,375
Lady Liberty is a purebred
ltalian greyhound.

70
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:08,416
Actually, l was talking about that guy.

71
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,651
Arnold!

72
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,387
Secure Lady Liberty.

73
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:16,991
Let's you and me take a little ride, son.

74
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,391
Stay.

75
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:25,763
<i>-Good dog.
-Get the lead out, Wilder!</i>

76
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,968
You know, l went to school here
with your father.

77
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:32,067
He acted like he owned the place,

78
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,512
just 'cause his family's name
was on that building over there.

79
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,378
You know what that name
means to me?

80
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:40,920
About as much as titties on a mule, son.
l run this outfit now.

81
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:44,218
And while you're here,
you'll follow Reardon's Rules.

82
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:47,816
No drinking, no fornicating,
and no partying, period.

83
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,590
Or you'll be the first Wilder
who fails to graduate from Coolidge.

84
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,428
Now, do you follow me?

85
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:57,401
Yes, sir! You prefer your mules titless!

86
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,571
Let's get one thing straight, son.

87
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:05,076
l may not be able to kick you out of here
'cause of your daddy and his dough.

88
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:09,137
But you screw with me,
and l'll make it so you'll pray to leave.

89
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:10,911
Out.

90
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,548
l'm glad we had this talk.

91
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:17,714
Means there won't be
any problems in the future.

92
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:24,328
Party tonight, party tonight.
Party tonight, party tonight, thank you.

93
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:29,198
You smell that, Farley?
That's the smell of opportunity.

94
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:33,261
The smell of thousands of new girls.
The... Hello.

95
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:36,831
Van Wilder, Chairman
of Freshman Relations, self-appointed.

96
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:38,570
This is my partner, Farley Marley.

97
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:42,580
-Jah Rastafari.
-He's from Jamaica.

98
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,343
-Right.
-We're having a little

99
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:47,386
room-warming soiree tonight.
Nothing big, just a few hundred friends,

100
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,945
foam machine, nitrous, frappuccinos.
We would love it if you ladies came.

101
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,389
-A party?
-You're joking, right?

102
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:03,169
No!

103
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:05,969
lt's okay.

104
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,770
Wow. This is embarrassing.

105
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:16,214
l can't believe nobody showed up.

106
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,744
Well, it's about time.

107
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,451
Party?

108
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:35,326
So, Yu Dum Fok! You came all the way
here from China.

109
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:39,235
Yes. Village l grow up in boring as shit.

110
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:45,710
No party. l dream of beer bong,
bimbos, and boob on my butt.

111
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:49,705
So, l work in sweatshop,
save money, come here.

112
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:53,582
Cannot even afford room,
have to sleep in janitor closet.

113
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:58,115
That's one of the most beautiful things
l've ever heard, Yu Dum Fok.

114
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:03,060
No offense to your ancestors,
but maybe we'll just call you Yu, Yu.

115
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:07,091
Van, how come no hot,
young, American cat?

116
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,725
Coolidge is number one party school!

117
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:13,736
1979. Wow!

118
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,300
Girls used to have hair?

119
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:23,045
l hate to break it to you, Yu,

120
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:26,280
but l don't think
that's the case anymore.

121
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:28,643
No party?

122
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,323
No beer bong?

123
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:35,286
-No boob on butt?
-No.

124
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:39,363
l go to janitor closet now.
Drink ''breach.''

125
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,360
Forget the ''breach.''

126
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:50,409
Boys, it's toga time.

127
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:22,569
Friends, Romans, grunting women,
lend me your beers.

128
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,598
Welcome.

129
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,667
Nice jugs.

130
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,539
They contain the sacred blood
of the lamb.

131
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,704
Do you wish to be purified?

132
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:03,248
We here for boob on butt.

133
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,612
Actually, l think we're lost.

134
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:12,357
Come with me. My sisters
will take care of your friends.

135
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,552
l'm not sure if you're aware,
but in the past few years

136
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:20,963
Coolidge has become a more
religious and conservative campus

137
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,830
than it used to be.

138
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:26,269
l'd better take these.

139
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,005
Alcohol is the devil's mouthwash.

140
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,277
At Coolidge, we're dry.

141
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,138
You know, science has made
incredible advancements

142
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,147
in personal lubrication.

143
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,740
You won't be needing these, either.

144
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:43,582
Orgasms are the devil's heroin.
Just once, and you're hooked.

145
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:51,965
''O daughters of Jerusalem,
do not awaken love until it is ready.''

146
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,555
-Amen.
-Amen.

147
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,867
Song of Solomon, 8:4.

148
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:02,298
Let she who is without sin
grasp the first bone.

149
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:07,136
Wilder, 69.

150
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,249
Perhaps you and your friends
should look into a different school.

151
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:15,184
We have enough sinners here.

152
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:17,779
You wouldn't happen to have
their phone numbers, would you?

153
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,121
You have a very impure spirit.

154
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:25,790
There's a dark, wretched hole
waiting for you.

155
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,964
Okay, but you have to buy me
a drink first.

156
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,831
l think that can be arranged.

157
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:36,398
Now l know what a tampon feels like.

158
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,976
This is a complete fuckery,
you know, man.

159
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,378
No poom poom, no ganja.

160
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:46,444
Vampires for Jesus,
throwing blood on us?

161
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:50,580
-l can't take four years of this bullshit.
-We drink ''breach,'' get sent home.

162
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,389
Hey! No one's drinking ''breach!''
And no one's going home.

163
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,423
So what did you have in mind?

164
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,200
We shake things up a bit.

165
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,211
Why don't we just buy some?

166
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:24,156
Where's the fun in that?

167
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:28,356
This almost as good as boob on butt.

168
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,623
Say hello to my little friend.

169
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,940
Sorry.

170
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,309
Don't forget to floss.

171
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:06,788
Hi, Dirk. How's that big gun of yours?

172
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,794
-Hey, honeybear.
-Hey, honeybear!

173
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:15,260
Kaitlin. So nice you could make it.
We missed you in Bible study again.

174
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,663
-Hymnal?
-Whoa!

175
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,403
Nice arm, Jezebel.

176
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:25,103
-l believe this is yours.
-Thanks.

177
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:28,237
Van Wilder, hopeless romantic.

178
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,110
-Kaitlin Hayes.
-My girlfriend.

179
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,349
Well, it's nice to see there are
some Christians

180
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,514
who still do charity work.

181
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,984
Come on, Kaitlin, let's go.

182
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,559
Yeah, before all the good seats
are taken!

183
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:48,633
No, thanks. l brought my own.

184
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:52,662
Thank you.

185
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:56,901
Today, l wanna talk about
something that's all over this school,

186
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,107
and it isn't pencils, no.
And it isn't books. But it's sin.

187
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,073
S-l-N. Sin.

188
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:10,180
You know, it seems like they'll let just
about anybody in school these days.

189
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,155
Except Jesus.

190
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:15,489
And, you know, l took the time
to check Jesus' transcripts,

191
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:19,497
and l find out that Jesus has
a perfect GPA.

192
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:22,528
Yeah, that stands
for God Point Average.

193
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,271
Amen, amen.

194
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,773
-Amen.
-Amen.

195
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:33,778
But what is the number one sin
on campus today?

196
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,349
Quite plainly, it's sex.

197
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:39,982
-Sex.
-S-E-X.

198
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:41,485
-Sex.
-Sex.

199
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:46,355
Even as we're speaking,
the sinning is beginning. Amen!

200
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,188
-Amen.
-Amen.

201
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:49,318
Amen, sisters.

202
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,226
-Gentlemen, the Lord is...
-Hallelujah, sister!

203
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:52,593
-...about to work in very...
-Hallelujah!

204
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:53,927
-...mysterious ways.
-Hallelujah!

205
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:57,901
That's right, sisters.
l want you to feel the Lord inside you.

206
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:05,201
Because fornication, copulation
and the king of all sins, masturbation,

207
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:09,304
is happening all around us,
even at this very moment.

208
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,576
-Amen!
-Amen!

209
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:17,621
But we've got a secret because
we've got Jesus on our side.

210
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,420
Can l get an amen?

211
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:21,891
-Amen!
-Amen!

212
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,191
Amen, sisters!
Yes, they're feeling it right now!

213
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:28,631
They got the power of the Lord
deep down inside them.

214
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,100
-Amen!
-Amen!

215
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:32,930
Hallelujah, sister, hallelujah.

216
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,973
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

217
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,539
-l want each of you out there to pray.
-Amen.

218
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:41,511
Pray that you might be
feeling what they're feeling.

219
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,774
-Amen!
-Amen!

220
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:45,248
Yes, they're talking to the big guy.

221
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:46,841
-Amen!
-Amen!

222
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,421
Oh, the sisters are feeling
mighty good right now.

223
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:51,888
-Amen, sisters!
-Amen!

224
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:54,391
lt's time for some tits and mass.

225
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,497
-Amen!
-Amen!

226
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,294
-Amen!
-Amen!

227
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:02,663
Amen, sisters!

228
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,327
That's what l'm talking about!

229
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,064
-Amen!
-Amen!

230
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,039
You might as well open up
your pearly gates, dear Lord.

231
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,509
'Cause these sisters are coming!
These sisters are coming!

232
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,546
These sisters are coming!

233
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:16,046
-Amen!
-Amen!

234
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,318
You know what these are?

235
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:19,875
You know what these are?

236
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:22,885
Yes, sir.

237
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:27,559
And l think experimentation
is healthy for any marriage.

238
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,892
You listen to me, funny man.
l can't prove it, but l know it was you.

239
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:36,226
And you can rest assured,
l will get to the bottom of this.

240
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:39,634
ln this case, Chuck,
may l recommend some Vaseline.

241
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:47,645
You know, nowadays,
the Dean has much more influence

242
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,474
over a student's curriculum.

243
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:54,014
And l have got something special
in store for you.

244
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,647
Something to build character.
Something to make you a man.

245
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:03,825
-Left, left, left, left, left, left...
-Left, left, left, left, left, left...

246
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,591
l'm gonna take a stab in the dark
and say

247
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:08,565
that none of you signed up
for this, either.

248
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:15,172
Well, if they think
that we came to college

249
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:18,072
to waste our time playing soldier

250
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:23,274
to some slack-jawed, pituitary-pumping,
testosterone-tweaking Neanderthal,

251
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,043
then they...

252
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,922
Are 100% correct.

253
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:33,856
Attention! Straight line! Eyes forward!

254
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:38,986
l'm Corporal Hayes.
l will be your drill instructor.

255
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:42,795
lt's my job to guide you
through your ROTC physical training,

256
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:46,167
which is required to graduate
from this institution.

257
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,640
Are there any questions?

258
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,270
Yes, soldier.

259
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:54,813
Do you, by chance, drill in private?

260
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:57,280
Well, Mr. Wilder, if you'd like,

261
00:22:57,383 --> 00:23:01,820
l'm sure l can arrange for us to spend
a little one-on-one time together.

262
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:05,217
This a new experience for you?

263
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:07,750
Yeah.

264
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:12,291
l usually go electric.
Helps get those hard-to-reach spots.

265
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,067
Hilarious. l've met guys like you before.

266
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:20,401
The only person you care about
is yourself.

267
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:23,672
-Something funny?
-Yeah.

268
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,304
l just can't wait to prove you wrong.

269
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,112
We'll see.

270
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:31,843
Oh, and by the way, you missed a spot.

271
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,247
Enjoy.

272
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:46,994
l'm sorry. l ordered mine well-done.

273
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,904
l have better food in sweatshop.

274
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,200
Oh, it can't be that bad, Yu.

275
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:11,779
-What? l had the munchies.
-Well, look what we have here.

276
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:14,420
l haven't seen this many turds

277
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:17,587
since l won
that campus hot-dog eating contest.

278
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:23,300
Yeah, l haven't seen this many pansies
since l was picking flowers yesterday.

279
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:26,337
Remember, l was making
that arrangement, and the...

280
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,532
So how's the chow, ladies?

281
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,099
l give the presentation three stars,
l really do,

282
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:34,873
but the pseudo meat, it's a little dry.

283
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,955
-There you go. All better.
-Yum, yum, yum.

284
00:24:58,004 --> 00:25:00,063
You know, l heard they were looking
for a few good men,

285
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:03,232
but l guess they'll take
whatever they can get.

286
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:10,075
-Hey, Dirk.
-Kaitlin! Hey, honeybear, hi!

287
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:12,375
What are you boys up to?

288
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:15,682
Well, we were just congratulating
these fine young soldiers here

289
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:19,554
on their first day of duty.
You know me, Lieutenant Friendly.

290
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:23,684
Lieutenant Friendly here even
volunteered to switch meals with me.

291
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:25,559
Oh, what a nice guy.

292
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,908
Yum, yum. That is so good.

293
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:40,438
How's yours, Dirk?

294
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,748
Oh, God.

295
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:00,890
Well, how was it?

296
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,662
Always leading by example.

297
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,071
-So, are we still going to the game?
-Oh, l...

298
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:14,703
You bet we are!

299
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,807
What game?

300
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,544
-There's a football game this weekend.
-Really?

301
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:21,779
These losers haven't won
a game in years.

302
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:23,013
Come on, it's not about winning
or losing.

303
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:25,317
lt's about supporting your school.

304
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:28,325
You know what? You are so right, babe.
School spirit.

305
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:29,689
Okay, well l'm gonna get back to class.

306
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,319
Okay. Bye.

307
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:37,094
All right, guess what, queerbait?
You're officially on my bad side.

308
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:53,350
The team's a joke, but the concessions
will probably buy me a new Humvee.

309
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:58,148
Right.

310
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:01,522
l take bigger hits than these guys
for breakfast.

311
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,820
No, it's not the team's fault.

312
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,057
-You guys, come on!
-They've got no inspiration.

313
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,600
<i>lt looks like the cheerleaders are
asking for a little divine intervention.</i>

314
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:12,398
l'll be right back.

315
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:15,369
Where you going, man?

316
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,573
To fix this.

317
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:26,073
l have never seen
such a sorry display in all my life.

318
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:28,984
l mean, where's the fire?
Where is the intensity?

319
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:32,922
And for God's sake,
where are the tight ends?

320
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:35,693
Your team needs you out there.

321
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:40,231
Okay, being a cheerleader isn't
about pigtails and pompoms.

322
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:43,824
lt's about standing by your team,
even when they suck.

323
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:47,201
Especially when they suck.

324
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:48,295
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

325
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,738
Now, do you think you can do that?

326
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:50,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

327
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,638
Do you think you can give it
the old college try?

328
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:54,770
-Yes.
-Yes.

329
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,408
Do you think maybe, just maybe,
you can help those guys score?

330
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:00,815
-Yes!
-Yes!

331
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,115
That's what l'm talking about.

332
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:08,052
But first, we're gonna have
to make a few cuts.

333
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:19,700
Who knew our cheerleaders were hot?

334
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:22,296
Who knew our cheerleaders
were women?

335
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:26,406
Hey, guys.
The girls have done their part.

336
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,642
Now it's your turn.

337
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:33,717
Oh, and they said
that if you win this thing,

338
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,413
they're throwing you a victory party.

339
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:41,617
Victory party, guys. All right, let's go.
One, two, three...

340
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,456
-Coolidge!
-Coolidge!

341
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:48,360
Come on! l know you can do it, now.

342
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:50,893
<i>l tell you,
l don't know whose idea it was,</i>

343
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:55,337
<i>but these cheerleaders are grinding it
harder than Juan Valdez.</i>

344
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,474
What the...

345
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,478
Sweet Jesus!

346
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:31,242
Now, that's what l'm talking about!

347
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:45,910
Watch your head!

348
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,822
Guys, give me a ride.

349
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:14,369
Hey!

350
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:17,508
-School spirit?
-No, thanks.

351
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,742
How about a beer?

352
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,222
ln a bottle.

353
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:32,058
l shouldn't be here.

354
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:50,948
Hey, wait up!

355
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:54,783
l'll walk you back to your dorm.

356
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:58,345
l'm sorry. l just... l can't afford to do
anything that might jeopardize

357
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,915
-getting into officer-training school.
-Understandable.

358
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:05,187
l must seem
like such a Goody Two-shoes.

359
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:06,355
No.

360
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:08,897
l was gonna say prude.

361
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:20,872
<i>You know, you should read
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.</i>

362
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:26,449
He say, ''All great warfare
is based on deception.

363
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:30,086
''Offer the enemy bait to lure him.

364
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:33,888
''Feign disorder and crush him.''

365
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,356
Or her.

366
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:41,566
He also says we cannot enter alliances

367
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:45,125
until we know the designs
of our neighbors. Good night.

368
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:52,202
You're not even going to let me
escort you to your room?

369
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:55,246
Now, what kind of a prude
would that make me?

370
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,751
Hey, where'd you come from?

371
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,291
Broke out of your little cage, huh?

372
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,751
What the hell?

373
00:33:45,597 --> 00:33:47,428
Oh, my God.

374
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:51,760
You're my new best friend.

375
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:53,871
Here's to you.

376
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,703
Colossus.

377
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,342
-Hey.
-Hey.

378
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:00,877
Hi! Great party.

379
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:03,709
Don't thank me. Thank tequila.
What's up?

380
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,276
Found your pants.

381
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:17,058
Van, l took your advice about shaving
my excess body hair, and it worked.

382
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:18,993
She said l'd get laid tonight.

383
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:21,156
-What's her major?
-Pre-law.

384
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:24,629
-Get it in writing.
-Hey, Van.

385
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:30,475
Hey, guys, guys, guys,
l will get to all of you later, l promise.

386
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,135
Wow!

387
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:39,507
Hey, big man on campus.

388
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:46,119
-A blessing and a curse.
-Van! Van, l need your help.

389
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:48,293
-Calm down, Yu.
-l meet girl in class, ''berry'' sexy.

390
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:51,785
-Calm down, Yu.
-l meet girl in class, ''berry'' sexy.

391
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:56,165
So l say she beautiful.
She say, ''Get lost!''

392
00:34:56,268 --> 00:35:00,227
So l say she smart. She say, ''Get lost!''

393
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:05,834
So l say, ''l know Van Wilder,''
and she say, ''Where your room?''

394
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:09,840
Things heating up,
but first l give her Connie ring ass.

395
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:12,246
-Connie who?
-Connie ring ass!

396
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,285
-Ring ass?
-Ring ass!

397
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:17,446
-Cunnilingus!
-Oh, right!

398
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,817
So next thing, she cry, she run out!

399
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,727
Show me what you did.

400
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:48,049
Jesus, man! You're lucky you didn't
send her to the fucking hospital.

401
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,723
Where did you learn that?

402
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:57,020
-Sex ''crass.''
-What sex ''crass''?

403
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:01,729
Now, sex is achieved when
a male's sin stick is in, on,

404
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,733
or in the same room as

405
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:05,928
a female's hell hole.

406
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,699
Now, no matter what the woman says,

407
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:11,435
the act of procreation should only last
for a few seconds.

408
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:15,747
And remember, if it feels good,
you're doing it wrong.

409
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:20,248
Professor Downs!
There's an emergency phone call.

410
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,152
-Your wife was in an accident.
-Tell her l'll call her later.

411
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:27,054
-And she totaled your Mustang.
-That bitch!

412
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:31,359
-Class, turn to pages 20 to 22 and...
-Hello.

413
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,225
Wake up!

414
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:39,766
My name is Professor Wilder.

415
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:46,307
l have BA, an MA and a PhD.
And l received a BJ from a double-D.

416
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:52,348
These are my teaching assistants.

417
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:57,150
Welcome to Sex 101 .

418
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,319
This is hot.

419
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,790
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

420
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:04,922
This is not.

421
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,395
-No!
-No!

422
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:09,993
Hand?

423
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:12,294
Bad!

424
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:16,369
We call this maneuver ''flanking.''

425
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:23,539
Who can name this position?

426
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,246
-Yu.
-Glass Bottom Boat!

427
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:29,820
And this one.

428
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:33,150
Analingus!

429
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:36,921
-And that one.
-Mississippi Kiss the Gypsy.

430
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:42,163
Spraying Mantis.
Horny Dancer. Superman.

431
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,631
The Gizzard of Oz!

432
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,633
That's my favorite.

433
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:54,072
-Ladies.
-Hello, hands, meet the glans.

434
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:57,409
-And?
-Don't be daft, work the shaft.

435
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:02,310
-Guys.
-Don't be a twit, rub that clit.

436
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:04,613
You're learning!

437
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,423
Now, remember,
always practice safe sex.

438
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:12,463
But clean up after yourselves.
Condoms are like newspapers.

439
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,088
They may be filled
with important stuff now,

440
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,657
but you don't want them lying around
tomorrow morning.

441
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:19,728
Write that down.

442
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:25,440
Miss Hayes.

443
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:30,642
l'll let it slide this time,
but if you plan on being teacher's pet

444
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:33,718
-you really should stay after class.
-Class?

445
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:36,314
You're kidding, right?

446
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:40,653
Nothing from that soft-core seminar
would actually work in real life.

447
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,586
Okay, l give you tongue if you like.

448
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:48,855
The point is you put on
a disgusting display of vulgar anatomy,

449
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,662
crude stereotypes and dirty limericks.

450
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,067
Which you took copious notes on.

451
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:55,704
This is all a game to you.

452
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:59,106
lt's a lot of smooth talk, and then it's
wham, bam, thank you, Van.

453
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,907
Well, my father taught me,
if it's something worth doing,

454
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:03,947
it's worth doing right.

455
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,574
Well, my father taught me
that the best things in life

456
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:08,516
are worth waiting for.

457
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,955
-Wait.
-Catch you later, teach.

458
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:19,453
Van! Van! Okay, thank you, thank you.

459
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:28,068
-l'm Yu.
-l'm Dongmei.

460
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:42,682
You know, l am not sure what it is,
but there is something in the air tonight.

461
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:44,814
Something called...

462
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:46,254
Love, girl.

463
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:50,021
See, that's what the reggae music
is all about.

464
00:39:50,128 --> 00:39:51,152
Love and...

465
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,423
Shrimp?

466
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,008
Look at those.

467
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,674
Flamethrowers! Use the flamethrowers!

468
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,586
Permission to come inside, sir?

469
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,558
Kaitlin, you look like a...

470
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,888
Tramp!

471
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,029
That's what l feel like sometimes.

472
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,930
l mean, l know she has a boyfriend,
but it's like...

473
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:34,634
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't be boring you with all this.

474
00:40:36,908 --> 00:40:40,036
Here. l have a little surprise for us.

475
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,191
Sweet and sour.

476
00:40:56,828 --> 00:41:00,286
Ready, aim, fire!

477
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:09,498
Kaitlin, what's gotten into you?

478
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:12,975
Let's just say l learned
a few things in class today.

479
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,448
Kaitlin, l need my energy.

480
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:20,177
l have to pass
that obstacle course in the morning.

481
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:22,276
l'll give you an obstacle.

482
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:26,084
Don't.

483
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,720
l am so glad you weren't busy tonight.

484
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,832
Go ahead.

485
00:42:38,897 --> 00:42:40,228
God.

486
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:46,729
Put some of Professor Van's
methods to the test last night?

487
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:48,567
You wish. What about you?

488
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:52,803
l figured you'd be in Wilder Hall
sucking beers with Susie Sorority.

489
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,878
Travel books.

490
00:42:56,915 --> 00:43:00,043
<i>l always had you pegged
as more of a Soldier of Fortune girl.</i>

491
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:02,847
Traveling's one of the reasons
why l wanna be in the military.

492
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:04,251
To see the world.

493
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:08,189
You know, there are vacations
that don't involve machine guns.

494
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:10,090
Oh, right.

495
00:43:10,628 --> 00:43:12,994
Spring break in Mexico,
winters in the Caribbean.

496
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:15,692
You probably spent summer
in Amsterdam.

497
00:43:17,368 --> 00:43:22,601
l think it's important to familiarize
oneself with international tongues.

498
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:27,872
-Life's just one big party, isn't it?
-Why shouldn't it be?

499
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:31,277
Last time l checked,
we only go around once, right?

500
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,748
Unless you believe in reincarnation.

501
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:37,948
ln that case, l wanna come back
as a ThighMaster.

502
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:41,618
What?

503
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,357
Hey! Wait up!

504
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:50,593
You know, you could be
a great leader if you just learned

505
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:52,192
how to follow orders first.

506
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,794
Not a big fan
of authority figures, actually.

507
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:57,966
-Someone has father issues.
-That makes two of us.

508
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:00,010
-Excuse me?
-Come on.

509
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:03,976
The whole military routine,
the tough exterior.

510
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,073
You don't know anything
about my father or me.

511
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:08,846
-You just see a uniform and...
-You just see a name on a building.

512
00:44:08,953 --> 00:44:11,513
Well, why don't you surprise me?

513
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:16,026
All right. First of all,
l've never even been in Wilder Hall.

514
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:20,191
And secondly,
for someone who's so big on rules,

515
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:24,662
here it is.

516
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:27,169
''Student undergarments should be
as modest

517
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,706
''and unrevealing as possible.''

518
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:33,844
-So?
-So my sixth sense is telling me...

519
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,849
-You're a thong girl.
-What? No, l'm not.

520
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:43,444
-My sixth sense does not lie.
-Well, it does this time.

521
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,455
And in the future,
you might want to keep it,

522
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:50,051
and the rest of your senses to yourself.
Some things are private, Private.

523
00:44:55,633 --> 00:45:00,764
Corporal, l think it's time we take things
to the next level.

524
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:04,207
l have waited so long
to hear you say that.

525
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:06,277
-What?
-Nothing, l...

526
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:10,810
Eve! Jesus, you almost scared
the courage out of me.

527
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,679
Hey, Dirk, l was just wondering
if you could help me.

528
00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:16,276
-With what?
-l need to talk to God.

529
00:45:16,387 --> 00:45:17,979
So go talk to him. l'm busy.

530
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:20,557
l need to feel him inside of me.

531
00:45:23,661 --> 00:45:25,754
Don't you wanna help me find God?

532
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:29,300
-Listen. l don't know what you're on...
-Just fuck me!

533
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,234
Get away from me, devil woman!

534
00:45:32,337 --> 00:45:33,361
-Dirk!
-Faster!

535
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:34,438
You get back here!

536
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,471
Yes, l bought you toilet paper.

537
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:40,305
No, it's not quilted. Golly!

538
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:47,113
l won't ask if you don't tell?

539
00:45:50,488 --> 00:45:53,582
What the... Hey, put me down!

540
00:45:57,896 --> 00:46:00,126
ls this where you bring all the boys?

541
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:02,563
Oh, yeah, you're a real comedian.

542
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:06,398
You like cracking your jokes,
throwing your little parties,

543
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:09,738
sticking your tongue
in other people's property?

544
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:12,309
Can someone get this guy a Tic Tac?

545
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:16,512
Well, l got news for you, Mr. Cool Guy,

546
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:21,517
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll, Mr. Hot Crotch!

547
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:28,124
Your party-boy bullshit
has no place here at Coolidge.

548
00:46:28,226 --> 00:46:30,626
And you're about to find out
the hard way.

549
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:31,717
l wanna watch!

550
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,855
This should teach you
not to mess with my girl.

551
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:40,932
Hold him!

552
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:46,167
Come on, Wilder. Drink up!

553
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:52,448
Had enough?

554
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:56,913
You wouldn't happen to have
a pale ale on tap, would you?

555
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:00,285
Screw it.

556
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,570
How your face feel?

557
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:09,110
Like a punching bag.

558
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,276
Maybe you should find another girl.

559
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:15,489
No, it's not just the girl, Farley.

560
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,652
Dirk and Reardon and all the rest
of those Cro-Magnon crotch diggers

561
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:24,357
need to learn they can't run
this place like Guantanamo U.

562
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,740
Oh, man! Who's been feeding
that dog corn again?

563
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:40,481
Farley, get some gloves.

564
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:46,380
All right, girls!

565
00:47:49,124 --> 00:47:52,855
This is covert ops! l want it by the book!

566
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:54,292
Now camo up! Let's go!

567
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:56,591
-Sir, yes, sir!
-Sir, yes, sir!

568
00:47:57,732 --> 00:48:00,963
-Jesus, it smells.
-Come on! Faster! Move! Yeah!

569
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:02,833
Put it on!

570
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:05,567
Mother of God!

571
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:09,107
Sir, he's right. lt smells like...

572
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,940
What do you want it
to smell like? Roses?

573
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,711
Put it on!

574
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:26,985
All right, troops, one mile left.
Double time! Let's go!

575
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:33,064
-What happened to your face?
-l ran into a tool.

576
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:41,765
Oh, Dirk!

577
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:45,334
Not now, honeybear,
we're in the middle of covert ops!

578
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,314
-What's that smell?
-That smell?

579
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:50,714
-Yeah.
-lt's the smell of war!

580
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:55,579
Well, it smells like crap.

581
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:05,123
-ls that corn?
-Back to base showers now!

582
00:49:07,635 --> 00:49:09,398
Ran into a tool, huh?

583
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,640
-Wilder is dead!
-Dirk, what are you doing here?

584
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,651
-lt's against the rules.
-l don't care about the rules.

585
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,221
-Now you sound like Van.
-No. No, no, no.

586
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:30,052
Don't you dare say that name to me!
l don't even wanna...

587
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:34,322
l don't even wanna hear that name!

588
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,830
-Dirk, calm down.
-You're forbidden to see him again.

589
00:49:37,932 --> 00:49:39,957
Excuse me?
You can't tell me who to see.

590
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:41,365
Oh, you heard me, Corporal.

591
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:44,905
l don't want you to see him.
You don't talk to him. Period!

592
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:48,342
Or what? You'll beat him up again?

593
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:51,710
He's not one of us, Kaitlin!

594
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:54,371
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

595
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,314
Well, then, l don't wanna be one of us,
either. Get out, Dirk!
