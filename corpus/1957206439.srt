ALL THOSE EXPERTS.

56
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,424
NO, NO,
I'M JUST PLAYING.

57
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,208
NO, SERIOUSLY,
I'M HONORED

58
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,515
THAT PEOPLE LOVE
MY GAME THAT MUCH.

59
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,125
BUT THERE WILL BE
A LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,170
IN THE DRAFT TOMORROW,

61
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,388
AND THE FIRST PICK
COULD BE ANYBODY.

62
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:52,737
NOW, TODD,
YOU WERE RAISED

63
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,217
IN THE GHETTO,
THE HOOD,

64
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,828
DRAGGED UP
IN THE STREETS

65
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,744
AFTER YOUR FATHER
ABANDONED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.

66
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,138
MY DAD NEVER LEFT.
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

67
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,705
THIS IS MY DAD.

68
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,229
NO GOVERNMENT
CHEESE?

69
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,404
NO WELFARE?

70
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:08,275
NO.

71
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,493
MY PARENTS
WORKED VERY HARD

72
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,191
TO PAY THE BILLS
AND KEEP CLOTHES ON MY BACK.

73
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,975
SO, MR. AND MRS.
ANDERSEN,

74
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,716
ONCE TODD IS SELECTED
IN THE DRAFT,

75
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,196
HE STANDS
TO MAKE MILLIONS.

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,459
DO YOU THINK THINGS WILL
CHANGE FOR YOUR FAMILY?

77
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,549
WE'RE A DOWN-HOME
KIND OF PEOPLE.

78
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,246
WE RAISED TODD
TO KNOW

79
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,421
THAT FAMILY VALUES

80
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,380
ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MONEY.

81
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,381
WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOLISM,

82
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:31,167
DRUG ABUSE,
THE SMOKE, THE DRINK?

83
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,604
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE?

84
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,910
NO?

85
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,999
ANYTHING?

86
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,261
TOMORROW
WILL PROBABLY BE

87
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,523
A HISTORICAL DAY
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

88
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,785
HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON CELEBRATING?

89
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,745
WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE IT
THE WAY THE ANDERSENS

90
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,095
HAVE ALWAYS CELEBRATED
FOR GENERATIONS.

91
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,618
WE'RE HAVING
A FAMILY...

92
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,838

COOKOUT!

93
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,622
WELL, THAT'S ALL
OUR TIME FOR NOW.

94
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,668
TODD, MR. AND MRS.
ANDERSEN, THANK YOU.

95
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,844
AND GOOD LUCK
TOMORROW IN THE DRAFT.

96
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:59,369

98
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,416

99
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,156
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHO THE...

100
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,855
YOU CAN STOP
ALL THAT SMILING.

101
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,335
THE CAMERA'S OFF.

102
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,293
THE CAMERA
LOVES ME, WOMAN.

103
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,209
I OUGHT TO HAVE
MY OWN TV SHOW.

104
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
HOW WAS I?

105
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,995
I DIDN'T COME OFF
TOO STIFF, DID I?

106
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,475
SANFORD AND JOJO.

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,911
JOJO AND THE SEX.

108
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:21,303
NO, BABY,
YOU WERE FINE.

109
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,219
YOU GO ON UP
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

110
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,308
YOU GOT A BIG DAY
TOMORROW.

111
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,615
EVERYBODY
LOVES JOJO.

112
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,312
I GOT IT! AH!

113
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,749
WHO WANTS
TO MARRY JOJO?

114
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:35,318
I GOT A PERFECT SHOW
FOR YOU, JOJO.

115
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,667
HUH?

116
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,191
JACKASS.

117
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,063
I DO NOT CARE
WHAT IT TAKES.

118
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:42,847
THERE IS NO WAY
HE'S GOING TO NEW JERSEY.

119
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,154
YO, DUDE, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
THE NUMBER-ONE PICK,

120
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:46,764
AND THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

121
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,375
I WANT HIM TAKING US
TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

122
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,116
AND HE CAN'T DO THAT
ANYWHERE ELSE. IS THAT CLEAR?

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,294
TODD ANDERSEN IS COMING
TO DALLAS. ARE WE STRAIGHT?

124
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,773
GET HIS ASS HERE.

125
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,688
Marv Albert: WE ARE
IN NEW YORK CITY,

126
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,342
THE MECCA
OF PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL,

127
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,039
WHERE LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN MADE.

128
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,390
LIVE FROM MADISON
SQUARE GARDEN,

129
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:07,176
IT'S THE 38th ANNUAL
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL DRAFT,

130
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:10,527
WHERE THE NEXT CROP
OF YOUNG SUPERSTARS,

131
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:15,053
LED BY 3-TIME ALL-AMERICAN
TODD ANDERSEN OUT OF RUTGERS,

132
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:19,014
WILL TAKE THAT NEXT STEP
INTO THE PROFESSIONAL RANKS.

133
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:22,496
HI, EVERYBODY. I'M MARV ALBERT
HERE ON THE FLOOR

134
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,149
WITH A COUPLE
OF THE GAME'S BEST--

135
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,326
ELTON BRAND
AND BARON DAVIS.

136
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,545
NOW, ELTON,
IS THIS KID TODD ANDERSEN

137
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,546
AS GOOD AS THE HYPE,

138
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,331
AND CAN HE TURN AROUND
A FRANCHISE?

139
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,071
WELL, MARV,
IF NEW JERSEY SELECTS

140
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:35,160
TODD ANDERSEN WITH
THE NUMBER-ONE PICK,

141
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,858
THEY'LL BE GETTING A KID
WITH TONS OF POTENTIAL.

142
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,164
GUYS THAT ARE IN THE PROS
LIKE MYSELF, BARON DAVIS,

143
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,341
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT THIS KID HAS

144
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,038
AND REALLY WANT
TO TAKE IT TO HIM.

145
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,996
A CANDID STATEMENT
FROM ONE OF THE GAME'S BEST.

146
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,783
NOW, BARON, DOES NEW JERSEY
KEEP THAT NUMBER-ONE PICK

147
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:49,914
AND TAKE TODD ANDERSEN?

148
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,176
THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF RUMORS CIRCULATING

149
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,091
THAT MARK CUBAN
WANTS TO MOVE UP

150
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,485
AND TAKE TODD ANDERSEN
WITH THE NUMBER-ONE PICK.

151
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,445
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN
MARK CUBAN WANTS SOMETHING,

152
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,620
HE USUALLY GETS IT.

153
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,404
SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

154
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,666
YES, IT IS
ALWAYS INTERESTING

155
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,801
TO SEE IF CUBAN'S
WHATEVER-IT-TAKES ATTITUDE

156
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:07,541
PAYS OFF.

157
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,064
WE'RE JUST MOMENTS AWAY

158
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:12,981
FOR THE DOORS TO SWING OPEN
FOR THE LEAGUE'S FUTURE STARS.

159
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,417
NEW JERSEY
IS ON THE CLOCK.

160
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:19,335
WE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT
FIRST PICK AFTER THESE WORDS.

161
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,777
I GOT TO USE
THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

162
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,606
WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST RELAX? NOW COME ON.

163
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,434
YOU'RE GONNA BE
FINE, ALL RIGHT?

164
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,568
TODD, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS HERE TODAY,

165
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,786
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

166
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,745
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE NUMBER ONE

167
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:40,051
IN ME AND YOUR DADDY'S EYES.
YOU HEAR ME?

168
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,749
THAT'S RIGHT.

169
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:42,576
WHOO!

170
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,794
SORRY I'M LATE.

171
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,926
I HAD TO PUT ON MY FACE

172
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,449
IN CASE THERE'S ANY CAMERAS

COME ON IN AND JOIN US.

1385
00:52:11,693 --> 00:52:13,956
I'M LADY EM.

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,742
AND THIS IS LIL DEE.

1387
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:17,612
HEY.

00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:19,614
AND THESE ARE
HER CHILDREN.

1389
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:21,747
THIS IS SONNY RAY,
LITTLE RAY, D.J.,

1390
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,184
SONNY D., D.Q.R.S.,
WHATEVER.

1391
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,447
SO MANY OF YOU.

1392
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:30,843
WHOO.

1393
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,192
IT'S SO HOT
IN HERE.

1394
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,586
HERE'S YOUR HAM, WITH ALL
THE SALT AND THE FAT

1395
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:37,371
AND THE ARTERY-CLOGGING
GOODNESS THAT YOU LOVE.

1396
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:40,548
AND NOW MY DRESS
SMELLS LIKE HAM.

1397
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:42,289
SO EXCUSE ME.

1398
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,334
OH, HONEY.

1399
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:44,726
THIS IS
A BONELESS HAM.

1400
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,208
YES. YES. THAT IS
A BONELESS HAM.

1401
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,210
OH, HONEY,
IT'S THE BONE

1402
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:51,559
THAT GIVES THE HAM
THE FLAVOR.

1403
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,257
THIS WILL NEVER DO.

1404
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,215
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

1405
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,565
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.
NOW LISTEN.

1406
00:52:57,609 --> 00:52:59,350
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TODD TO LOSE THIS DEAL

1407
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:02,962
BECAUSE OF THE WRONG HAM
NOW, WOULD YOU? HA HA.

1408
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:04,442
NO, I WOULDN'T.

1409
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:06,444
NO, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

1410
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:07,662
NOW LISTEN, SWEETIE.

1411
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,708
ABOUT 25 MILES
DOWN THE ROAD THERE,

1412
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:11,449
THERE'S A GOOD BUTCHER.

1413
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:14,974
GET YOU A GOOD HAM,
ALL RIGHT?

1414
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:16,715
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT?

1415
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:18,020
NOW, I'M
NOT QUITE SURE

1416
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,848
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

1417
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:22,111
OK, LADY, LET ME
BREAK IT DOWN

1418
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:23,330
FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

1419
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,680
IF A BLACK CAT
CROSSES YOUR PATH,

1420
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:26,768
THAT MEANS WHAT?

1421
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:28,683
7 YEARS BAD LUCK,
RIGHT? ALL RIGHT.

1422
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:31,817
NOW, WHAT'S SLANG
FOR A DUDE? A CAT.

1423
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,950
SO ERGO, I.E.,
I AM A BLACK CAT.

1424
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:37,039
SO IF I CROSS
YOUR PATH,

1425
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,258
YOU SUBLIMINALLY
THINK

1426
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:40,521
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
GET BAD LUCK.

1427
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,567
THAT IS WHY
MY WIFE LEFT ME,

1428
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,221
BECAUSE I'M BLACK.

1429
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:45,657
IS HE SERIOUS?

1430
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,746
OH, YEAH. SEE,
AT EVERY FAMILY COOKOUT,

1431
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:50,009
WE GET CAUGHT UP
ON EACH OTHER'S LIVES,

1432
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,054
NO MATTER
HOW SAD THEY ARE.

1433
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:54,796
SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES--
THEY'RE ALL AROUND US.

1434
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,668
YOU KNOW,
LIKE IN SPORTS.

1435
00:53:56,711 --> 00:53:58,278
LIKE HOCKEY.
WHY IS THERE

1436
00:53:58,322 --> 00:53:59,584
A BUNCH OF WHITE GUYS

1437
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:01,281
SMACKING A BLACK PUCK
AROUND THE ICE?

1438
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,892
WHY CAN'T THE PUCK
BE WHITE?

1439
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:06,330
WELL, BEING IN
SPORTS MANAGEMENT,

1440
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:08,767
I'D VENTURE TO SAY
THAT ON ICE,

1441
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:12,423
A WHITE PUCK MIGHT
BE DIFFICULT TO SEE.

1442
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:15,382
I'D EXPECT YOU TO SAY THAT.

1443
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:17,471
WAIT A MINUTE, LEROY.
WHAT ABOUT GOLF?

1444
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:19,386
I MEAN, THE BALL
IS WHITE.

1445
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,170
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1446
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:22,520
AND I THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

1447
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:23,912
IN GOLF, YOU
GOT TO DO WHAT?

1448
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:26,828
GET THAT WHITE BALL
IN THE HOLE.

1449
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:29,831
WHERE'S THE HOLE?
ON THE GREEN.

1450
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:31,442
GREEN. "FERTILITY."

1451
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:33,226
YOU SEE WHAT I'M
GETTING AT HERE?

1452
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,837
WHERE'S THAT HOLE?

1455
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:43,236
THEIR WHITE BALLS
IN MOTHER EARTH,

1456
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,022
SYMBOLIZING HOW THEY
WANT TO RAPE THE PLANET.

1457
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:51,288
I SHOULD WRITE
A BOOK, MAN.

1458
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:53,333
"THAT HAM HAS
TOO MUCH SALT IN IT.

1459
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,335
"NO, THAT HAM
HAS TOO MUCH BONE IN IT.

1460
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:59,426
NO, THAT HAM HAS
TOO MUCH PORK IN IT."

1461
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,691
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

1462

YOU'RE GONNA GO GET

1465
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:11,395
AND ONCE ALL THESE GHETTO
HOOD RATS ARE OUT OF MY HOUSE,

1466
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:13,353
WE'RE GONNA GET IT
FUMIGATED.

1467
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,791
THEN I WILL HAVE TODD
ALL TO MYSELF.

1468
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:26,888
WHAT'S UP,

1469
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:33,634
EXCUSE ME...

LET ME TELL YOU
