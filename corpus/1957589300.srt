1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,704
(glass breaking)

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,880
(uplifting electronic music)

3
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,487
- [Sophia Voiceover] This is me, Sophia.

4
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,258
Welcome to my shtetl, my village, Boston.

5
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,194
I work here at Lubinsky's Market,

6
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,862
selling goods to the locals.

7
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,633
These village people belong

8
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,703
to an ancient population called Russian Jews.

9
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,940
I started working here in college,

10
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,209
and I haven't left.

11
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:18,945
- Hi.

12
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,980
(speaks foreign language)

13
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,449
- 14.98.

14
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,286
Where'd you learn Russian?

15
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,154
- An ex, I only know a few words.

16
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,259
Thanks.

17
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,896
I don't need a bag.

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,097
- [Sophia] Oh.

19
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,467
- What's going on with that guy?

20
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,170
- [Sophia] He's Russian.

21
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,672
- So?

22
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,109
- So he's gonna stare at our only black customer.

23
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:50,910
- That's a good thing,

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,145
I thought he was giving me the sex eyes.

25
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,980
I was gonna tell you let him down easy for me.

26
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,317
By the way, that redhead pocketed a few oranges.

27
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,220
- Bye.

28
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,521
- [Sophia Voiceover] And why the shitty techno music?

29
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,890
Russians like it, so we play it all the time.

30
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,425
Welcome to my life.

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,392
- Dina!

32
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,296
Remind me why I'm still working at the bazaar.

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,431
- [Sophia Voiceover] I live with my girlfriend, Dina.

34
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,966
- I'm this close to quitting.

35
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,470
Hello!

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,343
Dina?

37
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,646
- [Sophia Voiceover] Correction, lived.

38
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,950
(sobs)

39
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,388
I don't know, maybe I was possessive and crazy,

40
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,423
or maybe I was just more in love with her

41
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,192
than she was with me.

42
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,699
(phone rings)

43
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,783
- Hello.

44
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,820
- Are you crying?

45
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,124
- Vicky, do you think I'm self-victimizing?

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,259
- Maybe.

47
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,596
No, absolutely not.

48
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,100
What do you mean exactly?

49
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,635
- Dina broke up with me.

50
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,006
- [Sophia Voiceover] This is my brother Vicky, he loves me.

51
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,242
But he loves everyone.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,311
- Dedushka's dead.

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,281
- What?

54
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,319
- He collapsed on the street.

55
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,541
- Okay.

56
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:22,462
- Okay.

57
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,468
- Dina broke up with me, so that won't be a problem.

58
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,240
Do I hear you smiling?

59
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,647
- [Sophia Voiceover] The day Dina and I started dating

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,116
is the day my grandmother stopped speaking to me.

61
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,152
We haven't talked in three years.

62
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,020
- Yep, yep.

63
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,455
Come on, a little more.

64
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,125
Okay.

65
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,259
- [Sophia Voiceover] That's Kiki,

66
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,262
part of the Selibovsky family, close family friends.

67
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,033
Too close.

68
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,869
(whimsical music)

69
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,471
- Go Sox!

70
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,641
- [Sophia Voiceover] I grew up in Boston,

71
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,010
but I wouldn't say I'm from here.

72
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,048
I would say that I'm from this house, 112 Murdoch Street.

73
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,386
Welcome to the Russian Embassy of Massachusetts.

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,822
Here's the shiva, the funeral after party

75
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,459
that lasts seven long days and nights.

76
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,194
(family chats)

77
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,629
- My little girl.

78
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,598
- [Sophia Voiceover] And this is my papochka.

79
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,134
The only thing he loves more than his mamochka

80
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,171
is his ballroom dancing partner, Ilanachka.

81
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,012
Look who is here.

82
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,247
- [Sophia Voiceover] Meet the Selibovskys.

83
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,083
Natasha was cheated on by her husband

84
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,152
with my grandmother's slutty dental hygienist,

85
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,723
and now we're fused at the hip forever.

86
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,393
And that's Trevor, Natasha's son and Kiki's brother.

87
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,429
He's not so bad. - So do you still do

88
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,066
the...

89
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,369
- Nothing, yeah.

90
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,337
- No, I...

91
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,376
- What do you do with your life?

92
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,846
- Well, I'm working in a lab,

93
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,517
doing research on the impaired venous drainage of the foot.

94
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,854
It's varicose veins.

95
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,694
I hear you're still dating that girl from college, Dina.

96
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,998
- We just broke up.

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,067
- I'm sorry.

98
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,802
- No, it's fine, actually,

99
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,537
all I had to do was read a letter.

100
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,709
(classical piano music)

101
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,677
- I love you so much, Sophiachka.

102
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,545
- Calm down.

103
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,215
- Trevor, how's the new apartment?

104
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,216
- It's beautiful.

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,684
I like the new facial hair.

106
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,787
- Just trimmed it, actually.

107
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,121
- Yeah, it looks good, man.

108
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:02,989
- Not really.

109
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,459
Can you talk to Babushka, please?

110
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,027
- Your breath is hideous.

111
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,203
- [Sophia Voiceover] This is the Rabbi,

112
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,838
the good soul who picked up my family

113
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,439
and the Selibovskys, fresh off the boat

114
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,843
during the great Russian Jewish migration of 1982.

115
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,348
(knocks)

116
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,150
- Would you please just let me in?

117
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,385
- [Natasha] Gonna be a minute.

118
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,619
- I'm gonna shit myself!

119
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,827
I can't believe you've survived this long

120
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,261
with just one bathroom.

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,398
- Thank god for the kitchen sink.

122
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,300
(laughs)

123
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,801
- Stop, it's gonna come out my mouth.

124
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,137
(knocks)

125
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,573
- I raised you with manners, don't embarrass me!

126
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,915
- You look nice.

127
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,950
- [Kiki] No I don't.

128
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,486
You don't look good at all.

129
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,423
- I know.

130
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,892
- [Kiki] You never change.

131
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,594
- I am timeless.

132
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,662
- [Kiki] (laughs) Sure.

133
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,701
- KK, I have news.

134
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,738
I'm gonna be a policeman.

135
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,974
- [Kiki] What, they're gonna give you a gun?

136
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,343
- Of course.

137
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,577
- [Kiki] You know what, Vicky?

138
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,346
You have a good voice.

139
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,881
Stick to the guitar.

140
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,848
- No I don't.

141
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,551
- [Kiki] Yeah you do.

142
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,586
- I could sing to you.

143
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,322
- [Kiki] Do it.

144
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,057
- Really? - Really.

145
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,937
- Gonna love you like before. - Intro to Kiki

146
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,472
and Vicky love nest.

147
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,208
These two love birds met when they were kids together.

148
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,513
Everyone remembers Sasha Kalinsky's bar mitzvah,

149
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,515
where Kiki dry humped the shit out of my brother

150
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,685
during an Usher song, and then he splooged all over himself.

151
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,989
We don't mention that. - Though they take me

152
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,190
for a toad.

153
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:26,232
And snap on my synapses, electrode.

154
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,473
Until the amygdala corrodes.

155
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,745
And I twitch and croak

156
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,216
as my head explodes.

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,519
(chuckles)

158
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,556
(toilet flushes)

159
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,294
- [Sophia Voiceover] So this used to be my room,

160
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,331
but my babushka sort of colonized it for herself.

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,934
Where's my grandfather's watch?

162
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,739
When I was a kid, instead of reading me bedtime stories,

163
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,075
my grandfather and I would act out Zolushka,

164
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,812
the Russian Cinderella, and I'd giggle myself to sleep.

165
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,783
Oh shit, that's probably her.

166
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,989
Babushka loves Benjamin Netanyahu,

167
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,991
Bach, and anything fermented.

168
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,960
- [Sophia Voiceover] She survived Stalin,

169
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,363
and I survived her.

170
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,766
- [Sophia] I'm not moving back.

171
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,469
- Get out of the closet.

172
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,876
- Can I have the watch?

173
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,743
- No.

174
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,216
- Papa's just gonna sell it.

175
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,092
- [Sophia Voiceover] He wore it my entire childhood.

176
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,860
- Well I'm almost 30 years old,

177
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,463
and you're just gonna throw away everything anyway.

178
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,035
- Yeah? - Yeah.

179
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,705
- [Sophia] That's fine.

180
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,943
- [Sophia Voiceover] You know, you can be from a place,

181
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,845
but it's a lot harder to find a home.

182
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,416
Home is where my fridge is, full of salmon,

183
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,785
almond milk, and light.

184
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,456
(polka music)

185
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,359
- If you're not a liberal by the age of 21,

186
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,794
you have no heart.

187
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,798
If you're a liberal after the age of 21, you have no head.

188
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,301
(derisive laughter)

189
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,003
- Who invited this loser?

190
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,907
Get off the stage, get off the stage!

191
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,476
- If you weren't such a bitch,

192
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,778
I might think about being part of your life.

193
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,584
(phone rings)

194
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,960
Hi.

195
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,328
- [Sophia] Fine.

196
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,866
- I just saw you.

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,468
- Three days ago.

198
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,472
We are almost done with the leftovers.

199
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:58,210
- [Sophia] So what?

200
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,015
- [Victor] Meeting friends.

201
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,252
- Babushka said you had a good talk the other day.

202
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,753
- I have friends, they're all American,

203
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,288
so I don't bring them here.

204
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,625
- Not exactly.

205
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,230
- Sophia.

206
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,541
- I don't believe you.

207
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,423
(polka music)

208
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,972
- I gotta get right size.

209
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:07,046
So I'm showing up here to hear from all of you people.

210
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,416
Thank you all for being here.

211
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,856
You set this right.

212
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,991
Thank you.

213
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,526
- Thank you, Mike.

214
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:26,699
- So, have any folks here with a burning desire to share?

215
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,600
Speak up.

216
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,435
- [Sophia Voiceover] My brother's been going

217
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,769
to these AA meetings.

218
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,740
- Hi, I'm Victor, I'm an alcoholic.

219
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,708
- [Group] Hi Victor.

220
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,743
- Maybe.

221
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,579
- [Sophia Voiceover] He thinks he's a drunk.

222
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,684
- Sometimes I feel like I'm the type of person who

223
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,554
isn't meant to be happy.

224
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,267
- Thanks, Victor.

225
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,636
- My grandfather just dropped dead.

226
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,041
No one's talking about it.

227
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,947
And he was the only one

228
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,752
who kept things sane in the house.

229
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:26,158
There is a difference between someone who is an alcoholic

230
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,896
and someone who self-medicates every now and then.

231
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,933
I'd like to know what that difference is.

232
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,851
- Thanks, Victor.

233
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,094
- [Sophia Voiceover] I don't really have a family right now.

234
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,029
I don't really have friends, either.

235
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,731
They were all pretty much Dina's.

236
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,600
- [Sam] You know what I'm saying?

237
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,135
- [Dominic] Yeah, I know how it is.

238
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,337
- [Sam] We got this shit, boo.

239
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,505
- Yeah, yeah we do.

240
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,874
I feel like I'm Pikachu,

241
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,544
and Liberace is like my evolved form.

242
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,245
- I guess, what happens when you evolve,

243
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,748
you gain more chest hair and rhinestones?

244
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,582
- Yeah.

245
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:27,119
(upbeat electronic music)

246
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,422
Whatever, I think the pole will end it.

247
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,925
- All I'm saying is, pick one metaphor and stick with it.

248
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,593
- They all connect.

249
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,263
- Dominic, I know you're a boss, you know you're a boss.

250
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,131
- Yeah.

251
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:44,937
- You want a receipt?

252
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,871
- No thanks.

253
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,207
- I think I'm gonna do a new one tonight.

254
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,542
Hey, can I actually have an extra spoon for the caviar?

255
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,611
- No, I'm not sharing.

256
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm working on new material tonight, too.

257
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,349
- Cyanobacteria.

258
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:05,491
You thrive in hot water like cyanobacteria.

259
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,761
Blue-green algae, the bluest eye,

260
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,831
the eye of the hot springs snake, growling.

261
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,369
Dip me, dip we, evermore.

262
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,005
Blessed is he who comes in the mouth of the lord,

263
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,076
spermatic exultation, Old Faithful's girlish exhalation,

264
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,545
yelling Old Yeller, howl at the moon

265
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,481
as I implore your rump with my pump.

266
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,886
The frenulum of the national park system

267
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,889
opens itself to you, citizens of America.

268
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:42,227
Consider purchasing a national park pass for only $80.

269
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,796
Imagine what awaits.

270
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,533
- Wow.

271
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,271
That was really emotional.

272
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,072
- Would you say it landed?

273
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,276
- Yeah, yeah, I'd say that landed, for sure.

274
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:04,149
I really liked how you rhymed rump with pump.

275
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,284
- Thanks.

276
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,653
- I gotta go set up.

277
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,755
- Oh, we have a weekly open mic at Jacque's,

278
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,523
if you wanna see more of my poetry.

279
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,391
- [Sophia] Yeah?

280
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,028
- Has anybody ever told you you look like Gloria Estefan?

281
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,229
- [Sophia] No.

282
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,098
- He thinks everyone he likes looks like Gloria Estefan,

283
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,799
including himself, let's go.

284
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,267
- She does, see you.

285
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,135
- Bye.

286
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,774
- [Sophia Voiceover] No, I'm gonna go to this,

287
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,342
I need to go to the show.

288
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,543
I really need to go.

289
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,912
I need to move home and make some shekels.

290
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,914
Oh my god, if I died tomorrow,

291
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,617
I'd have like five people at my funeral.

292
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,185
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to the show.

293
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,520
I need friends.

294
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,222
I need to move home, I need to make some shekels.

295
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,291
Shit, if I had a funeral tomorrow, nobody would show up.

296
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,659
I need to do this, I need to just go, shut up, Sophia.

297
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,864
Shut up, I need friends.

298
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,100
You just need friends, just walk in.

299
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,069
Shut up, just walk in.

300
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,403
Follow the...

301
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,806
Dina, fuck you, motherfucker.

302
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,608
Sophia, stop wasting your fucking life

303
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,977
like you did for the last three goddamn years.

304
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,313
Just walk in, stop wasting your fucking life

305
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,283
like you did for the last three goddamn years.

306
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,585
Dina, fuck you, Dina!

307
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,553
Fuck you, Dina, fuck you.

308
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,954
Fuck you, you don't get to break up with me,

309
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,656
you fucking cunt, just walk in, Sophia.

310
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,824
I'm not depressed.

311
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,526
Fuck you, Dina, walk in, Sophia.

312
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,927
Fuck you, Dina, I'm not depressed.

313
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,428
- No white people could ask me for miles,

314
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,031
I'd go all the way from JFK to LA in peace.

315
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,900
(audience laughs)

316
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:28,867
You gotta embrace your stereotypes, right?

317
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,435
We think Asians are magical,

318
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,703
we think one touch will knock you out.

319
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,838
No one's running up on Asians,

320
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,506
we leave them alone for the most part.

321
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,241
White women have the power of tears, right?

322
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,645
You guys cry and get whatever you want, beautiful.

323
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,746
Beautiful.

324
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,447
Every time I tell that joke, there's a white woman

325
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,448
in the audience like mm-mm,

326
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,517
there's a white guy next to her like yeah, yeah.

327
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,451
They cry.

328
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,456
It's fine, embrace your thing.

329
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,158
I wish people cared when I cried.

330
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,494
I'd do it more often, but they don't.

331
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,628
No one cares when women of color,

332
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,097
I don't even care when a woman of color cries.

333
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,566
I see a woman of color cry, I'm like,

334
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,100
times are hard, what do you want from me?

335
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,201
(audience laughs)

336
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,136
Whole world.

337
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,039
I see a white woman cry, I'm like,

338
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,442
oh my god, we gotta do something, look at her!

339
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,478
She's distressed, she doesn't deserve this.

340
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,380
- [Sophia Voiceover] I hate myself.

341
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,316
I should've stayed home.

342
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,184
(crowd cheers) - Yeah.

343
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,086
Now let's get this mic started off right

344
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,288
by welcoming everyone's favorite Italian sissy

345
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,792
from the south shore, Dominic Galliano!

346
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,460
Bring that ass up here, Galliano!

347
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,462
- [Sophia Voiceover] Who am I?

348
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,930
The biggest achievement I ever made

349
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,266
was eating a whole pizza when I wasn't high.

350
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,368
- Hey everybody, how's it going?

351
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,472
I'm Dominic Galliano, and

352
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,810
I'm gonna play a little song for you

353
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,813
while I do a poem.

354
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,716
(plays classical tune)

355
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,652
And the poem is called Nature's Calamari.

356
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,923
- [Sophia Voiceover] I have my father's hairy arms.

357
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,159
Sexy.

358
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,763
- [Dominic] Like seashells scattered along the shore.

359
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,299
The ocean's spray froths to a head

360
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,301
to feed my bitter gloom, weeping.

361
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,836
- Oh, excuse me.

362
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,705
- [Dominic] Speak to me, Poseidon...

363
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,973
- You're really funny.

364
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,041
- Thanks.

365
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,376
- What's your name, again?

366
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,846
- [Sophia Voiceover] Sam.

367
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,848
- I'm Sophia.

368
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,182
- Thought you had to work.

369
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,786
- I've never been to one of these before.

370
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,121
- An open mic?

371
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,156
Happens every Tuesday.

372
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,493
- So you just sign up, and if you have something,

373
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,528
then you just show up?

374
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,964
- Yeah, why, what do you wanna do, standup?

375
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,501
- Maybe, I don't know.

376
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,170
- There's been a flood of you guys lately.

377
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,940
- Well, I guess I'm always a step behind the trend.

378
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,908
- Apparently.

379
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,543
- [Sophia Voiceover] Should I be embarrassed?

380
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,046
Just like middle school.

381
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,182
My boobs are even about the same size.

382
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,185
Fucker.

383
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,788
- (yelps) That hurts.

384
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
- [Sophia Voiceover] I've decided to move home

385
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,124
and look for unconditional love.

386
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,559
- It's beautiful.

387
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,827
- [Sophia Voiceover] Where I'm most likely to find it.

388
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,861
(phone rings)

389
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,229
Here's to regressing.

390
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,231
- Hello?

391
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,701
Hi, Ilana.

392
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,372
- You need to have your eyebrows done.

393
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,573
- [Sophia Voiceover] I remember when they put me into

394
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,910
that ugly debuncus and this Russian poofy jacket thing,

395
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,212
and I walk into school and there was Casey Rothcop

396
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,282
wearing her red North Face and Uggs, and was like,

397
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,751
"You look fresh off the boat."

398
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,187
At least I'm not alone with my thoughts anymore.

399
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,972
- That's enough, Mama, give me a break!

400
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,675
- Ilana, goodbye.

401
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,944
- Mama!

402
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,837
And I am a grown man, with my pants down,

403
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,873
letting my mom yell at me.

404
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,661
- [Natasha] Oi, Marina.

405
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,163
- Oi, Marina.

406
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,264
- What, Marina?

407
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,665
- You actually have a nice voice.

408
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,033
- [Natasha] What are you going to make for dinner?

409
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,968
- I don't know.

410
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,837
(strums guitar)

411
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,038
- Victor.

412
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,340
When are you going to ask my Kiki out?

413
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,475
- Maybe cutlets.

414
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,077
- Never.

415
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,412
- Never.

416
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,815
You've been flirting with her since the third grade.

417
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,150
- Not at all, no I haven't.

418
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,293
(knocking)

419
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:27,766
- Hi.

420
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,171
- We saw you next to each other at the shiva

421
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,873
and thought it's time.

422
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,142
- Exactly. (sneezes)

423
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,044
It's time. - It's time for the wedding.

424
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,280
- Imagine, why wouldn't I?

425
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,649
- [Sophia Voiceover] Why me?

426
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,153
- This is, I'm sorry.

427
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,059
(upbeat music)

428
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,260
- [Sophia] No.

429
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,643
(singing in foreign language)

430
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,391
- Oh my god.

431
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,225
- You have to get that.

432
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,260
- Yeah I do.

433
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,864
And you have to get that.

434
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,732
- Amazing.

435
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,001
- Thank you.

436
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,068
- [Trevor] Thanks so much.

437
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,536
- Oh, you're welcome. - Thank you.

438
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,072
- Thank you. - Have a good one.

439
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,015
We should have bought more stuff at the toy store.

440
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,751
- I guess so.

441
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,489
- Do you wanna swing?

442
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,257
- Sure.

443
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,997
- Can't believe I'm on a date with Fran Drescher's double,

444
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,833
this is like a dream come true for me.

445
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,136
- I can't believe this.

446
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,275
Two weeks ago, I had my own apartment

447
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,011
and I was in a relationship with somebody who knew me.

448
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,416
- Don't do that.

449
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,954
- And now I'm on a date with a dude.

450
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,523
- A dude?

451
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,461
- Your hair is so square.

452
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,963
- Look Sophia, I didn't wanna do this either,

453
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,297
I still have a girlfriend.

454
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,901
- You have a girlfriend?

455
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,436
- Yeah, my mother's insane.

456
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,771
Catherine knows that.

457
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,476
- Catherine, you have a girlfriend named Catherine?

458
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,079
- Yeah, my mom cries every time I mention her name.

459
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,250
- We should pretend like we're dating

460
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,320
and then have this explosive fight in front of them.

461
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:06,057
- So we'd bicker at dinner,

462
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,127
and then it escalates into me calling you an ugly wench,

463
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,462
and then you start crying?

464
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,932
- And it'll get them to shut up.

465
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,234
- That's true.

466
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,649
- You could've done more with your tongue.

467
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,617
- God.

468
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,219
You know, Catherine loves the way I kiss.

469
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,255
- Well maybe Catherine doesn't know any better.

470
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,390
- She's bisexual.

471
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,092
- Everyone's bisexual.

472
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,528
- Everyone is not bisexual.

473
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,397
- Everyone is bisexual.

474
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,732
They're bisexual or they're sexually repressed dudes

475
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,000
who still get their haircuts at Supercuts.

476
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,568
- Okay, I am not sexually repressed.

477
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,973
- Have you ever had anyone put anything in your ass?

478
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,709
- No, but hey, that doesn't mean I'm self-hating.

479
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,210
- Then you simply haven't lived.

480
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,646
- And you obviously have never had a hemorrhoid.

481
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,785
- Alright. - Alright.

482
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,958
- Please, can we do it?

483
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,528
- Do what, anal sex or me pretending to break up with you?

484
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,696
- Both, one, the other, I don't know,

485
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,830
pick one, please! - Oh my god,

486
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,131
you are relentless.

487
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,700
- If you love me, you'll do it.

488
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,641
- Fine, I'll pretend to break up with you,

489
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,243
if you promise to return my calls from now on.

490
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,313
- I promise to return your calls, right now, all of them.

491
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,086
Can we get a burrito, I'm hungry.

492
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,856
- No, because I am already exhausted by you.

493
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,193
- Okay.

494
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,763
Bye.

495
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:01,206
- [Sophia Voiceover] Mm, chicken burrito with guac

496
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,843
and sour cream and cheese. (sighs)

497
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,545
- [Radio Announcer] (speaks foreign language)

498
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,481
- [Sophia Voiceover] This is Babushka's secret dungeon lair,

499
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,483
where she plots to take over the world.

500
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,252
She comes here to get away,

501
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,354
because she hates planes and can't drive.

502
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,858
She washes everything twice

503
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,693
because my father doesn't like to wipe.

504
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,300
- Hi, it's me.

505
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,771
I need to see you.

506
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,639
I want...

507
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:42,013
Let's have Shabbat dinner this Friday.

508
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,148
Here.

509
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,018
Uh-huh.

510
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,955
Oh, just a minute.

511
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,087
Yeah.

512
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:25,657
Bye.

513
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,965
- [Sophia Voiceover] Oh my god, that was my first date

514
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,832
since Dina.

515
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,905
What if I bump into Dina, what would I say?

516
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,875
It's a small city, I could bump into her, what would I say?

517
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,146
- Hey, how are you?

518
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,449
- How am I?

519
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,718
Let me tell you.

520
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,354
I have no one.

521
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,558
My grandfather's underground, and you left me,

522
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,895
without the decency of breaking up with me in person,

523
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,263
because you're a coward.

524
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:12,370
I wish that I could drop dead right the fuck now,

525
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,341
so that you never had the opportunity to say goodbye to me.

526
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,950
- According to white people,

527
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,187
I look like I wanna be told I look like Jackie Chan.

528
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,557
And here's the thing, I don't mind being told

529
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,861
I look like another Asian, 'cause mistakes happen.

530
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:40,965
What I do mind, being told I look like a 57 year old.

531
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,101
(crowd laughs)

532
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,135
Because that's rude!

533
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,604
- Hi.

534
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,972
- Hey!

535
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,906
You gonna sign up?

536
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:50,975
- It is Tuesday.

537
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,177
- It is.

538
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,446
What happened to your hair?

539
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,517
- Hello.

540
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,620
My name is Sophia Pinsky.

541
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,359
So my grandfather just suddenly died.

542
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,928
- I feel great. - I know what you're thinking,

543
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,698
suddenly, suddenly, don't grandparents predictably die?

544
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,335
It's like buying a goldfish. - Be positive.

545
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,738
- You have seven days, and after seven days go by,

546
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,307
boom, goldfish is bloated,

547
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,208
floating at the top of the fish tank.

548
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,744
- [Sophia Voiceover] I'm special.

549
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,846
- Don't buy goldfish, cultivate ambivalence

550
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,782
about your grandparents.

551
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,017
(crowd chuckles)

552
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,454
My grandfather was my favorite family member.

553
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,760
The rest are my father, who's depressive,

554
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,395
my alcoholic brother,

555
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,731
and my international war criminal grandmother.

556
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,903
- [Man] Very funny.

557
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,146
- Could you actually, do you mind getting,

558
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,247
just give me my bag.

559
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,016
- Sure. - Thanks.

560
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,765
(crowd laughs)

561
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,803
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Vladimir Putin.

562
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,806
I know what you're thinking,

563
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,310
he looks even more muscular in person.

564
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,546
Because I wrestle bears.

565
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,215
I also know what you're thinking.

566
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,852
Hey, how does this man with such masculine confidence

567
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,822
and manly stature, does he have any secrets?

568
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,459
And the answer is yes.

569
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,562
I like to stimulate my prostate.

570
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,337
But everyone says that's gay.

571
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,205
Americans think that's so gay.

572
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,040
Gay, gay, gay, gay.

573
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,310
Not gay.

574
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,148
I am the most heterosexual man in all of Russia.

575
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,319
I couldn't be gay, because we have the most beautiful women

576
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,554
in all the world.

577
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:21,359
Because a woman is beautiful when she cries,

578
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,063
and our women are always crying.

579
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,333
(crowd applauds)

580
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,037
- Hey Spi, we're going to the diner, you in?

581
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,774
It's open mic, I can't just turn people away.

582
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,943
- That would be hitting rock bottom.

583
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,244
- One day we won't have to do these mics,

584
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,480
I'll be selling out stadiums like Dave Chapelle.

585
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,916
I don't know where I'd be without it.

586
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,287
Probably depressed as fuck, no friends, no aspirations.

587
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,789
Getting a bunch of strangers to connect with you,

588
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,193
like really connect, it's like an orgy of the minds.

589
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,060
- Exactly.

590
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,663
I once recited one of my poems

591
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,698
on the T to a bunch of strangers.

592
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,767
It's 'cause it was a shitty day outside,

593
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,769
it was cold and gray.

594
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,003
- I remember this.

595
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,940
- And I got up in the middle of the train and I read a poem,

596
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,174
without even a piano.

597
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,877
And I would say it really landed.

598
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,580
People thought what I was saying.

599
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,350
One person even came to a bunch of shows afterward.

600
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,451
- I remember that guy.

601
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,053
- Yeah.

602
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,056
I just need somebody to hear a line in one of my poems

603
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,826
and say "Yes, that's the kind of sex I wanna have.

604
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,395
"I'm a freak, too."

605
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,099
- So what about you, what's your deal?

606
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,303
- I don't know.

607
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:43,374
It's a free place to go and you're all really nice.

608
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,911
(upbeat electronic music)

609
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:54,752
I don't know.

610
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,927
I want to not give a shit, and you both live your lives

611
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,464
in this objectively humiliating way.

612
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,800
And I want that.

613
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,005
Just trying to figure it out for myself.

614
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,976
- That took some balls.

615
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,080
- Can I have one?

616
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,248
- Sure. - Good.

617
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,187
- Damn it!

618
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,423
I have to go to work.

619
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,824
- Where?

620
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,893
- I'm a barista as starfucks.

621
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,631
See you later. - Bye, D.

622
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,034
- Bye. - See you.

623
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,475
- Maybe your family could come.

624
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,977
My mom occasionally does.

625
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,614
It's not really her thing, but she feels included.

626
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,082
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

627
00:36:59,116 --> 00:36:59,951
- Why not?

628
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,820
- They would never.

629
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,823
And my mom doesn't live around here.

630
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,491
- Where is she?

631
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,463
- Parts of her are scattered across the Atlantic Ocean,

632
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:16,033
and I have the rest of her in tupperware in my bag.

633
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,302
- I'm sorry to hear that.

634
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,605
- I've had decades to get over it,

635
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,406
so there's no reason to be sorry.

636
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,808
- It's still tough.

637
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,284
- [Sophia Voiceover] She wants to have sex with me, right?

638
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,595
Say you have nice eyes.

639
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,299
- You have really pretty eyes.

640
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,236
- That's us.

641
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,750
- What are you doing now?

642
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,617
- Going home.

643
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,953
- To your house?

644
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,388
- Yeah, where you going?

645
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,257
- Same, home.

646
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,294
- Do you need a place to crash?

647
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,729
My girlfriend wouldn't mind.

648
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,766
- No.

649
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,735
I just went through a breakup.

650
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,137
- Sorry.

651
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,307
- It's fine, I just don't really wanna be around couples.

652
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,274
- Course you don't.

653
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,645
- Hey, but at some point, I'd like some friends.

654
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,515
- Nope, sorry, got too many white friends as it is.

655
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,683
I gotta cap it off at four,

656
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,886
otherwise I start doing the Carlton uncontrollably.

657
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,753
- Seriously?

658
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,895
Do you have to go home right now?

659
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,464
- Yeah.

660
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,139
- See you next Tuesday?

661
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,974
- [Sam] It's an open mic, you're in.

662
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,146
(polka music)

663
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,585
(vibrator whirs)

664
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,522
(sighs)

665
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,423
- Let me do it.

666
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,359
Let me do it, I got it.

667
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:27,732
(singing in foreign language)

668
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,072
- Where's the sour cream?

669
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,408
- Aisle one.

670
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,811
- Can you get it for me?

671
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,379
- No.

672
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,915
- Do I have to force you to get it for me?

673
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,922
- Is that enough?

674
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:52,757
(yelps) - You can never

675
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,358
have enough sour cream.

676
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,460
(whoops)

677
00:39:58,796 --> 00:39:59,930
- Fuck!

678
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,799
- [Sam's Girlfriend] So I hear you work at a store.

679
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,936
- Yeah, what do you do?

680
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,173
- I'm a merchandiser at Neiman Marcus.

681
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,142
- Wow.

682
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,779
So we both work at stores.

683
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,088
I'm sorry, I really invited myself over.

684
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,561
- I mean, it is your fantasy.

685
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,466
- I can leave.

686
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,046
(sighs)

687
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,384
So sorry, I almost took this.

688
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,557
Thanks again.

689
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,424
- Whoa.

690
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:04,962
- [Marina] Sophia!

691
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,230
- Morning. - Uh-huh.

692
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,603
- Why, what's wrong with these?

693
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:19,910
Good morning.

694
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,266
- You told me this.

695
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,791
- I know, Baba.

696
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:26,644
- Okay.

697
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,259
- Here we go.

698
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,127
- Don't worry.

699
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:49,566
- Thank god for you.

700
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,624
- Can I invite Trevor?

701
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,862
- I like Trevor.

702
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,130
I love Trevor.

703
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:20,998
- Wow.

704
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,282
- Okay.

705
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:47,057
- Do you ever stop to think before you speak?

706
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,493
Just now, I was gonna tell you that I blame you

707
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,663
for everything that happens in this family that goes wrong.

708
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:59,036
But I didn't, because I thought it might hurt your feelings.

709
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,938
Your feelings.

710
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,808
Other peoples' feelings.

711
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,012
Have you ever heard of those?

712
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,148
(somber guitar music)

713
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,816
- Cut this up.

714
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,518
- I don't want to.

715
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,186
- Cut the chicken.

716
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,054
- No.

717
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,525
- You want to eat, then cut the chicken.

718
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,961
- [Sophia] I'm not gonna cut the chicken.

719
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,963
- Cut the chicken!

720
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,331
- You cut the chicken!

721
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,273
- I need a break.

722
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:38,976
- Already!

723
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,615
- Where did she go?

724
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,169
- [Sophia Voiceover] Vicky.

725
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,938
He's the only person I know who loves unconditionally,

726
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,074
like a puppy.

727
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:10,941
- Welcome home.

728
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,277
- [Sophia Voiceover] So the fact that he loves me

729
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,945
doesn't actually mean much.

730
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,416
- Here, have some.

731
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,284
- No thanks.

732
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,154
- Hey, I know it's early and I need to stop drinking.

733
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,190
- I didn't say anything.

734
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,891
- I can stop when I need to.

735
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,327
- What are you talking about?

736
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,396
- I have a codependent relationship with alcohol,

737
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,764
and I need to clean up my act

738
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,833
if I'm gonna do the police exam thing.

739
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,302
(chuckles)

740
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,071
- What a moralistic, pathetic way to earn money.

741
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,975
- I couldn't be more pathetic right now

742
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,010
by anybody's standards.

743
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,212
- Fuck off.

744
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,081
- I'm becoming a cop because I really wanna be a cop.

745
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,417
Do you care about what I want,

746
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,320
does anybody care about what I want?

747
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,655
- [Sophia Voiceover] I worry I'm becoming my grandmother.

748
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,959
I should be so lucky, I'm not doing anything

749
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,994
with my education, I work at a grocery store

750
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,064
and she was a fucking doctor in the USSR.

751
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,267
You don't know how lucky you are, boy.

752
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,638
Back in the US, back in the US, back in the USSR.

753
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,506
- I'm sorry.

754
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,276
- Okay.

755
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,812
- You wanna be a cop.

756
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,148
- Right. - Okay.

757
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:26,950
- Okay. - You're right.

758
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,453
- Talk about moralistic.

759
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,587
- Sorry.

760
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,565
- What's going on with you?

761
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,432
- Nothing.

762
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,235
- What's going on with you and Trevor?

763
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,637
- Absolutely nothing.

764
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:49,506
- I knew it.

765
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,342
- I'm fine.

766
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,080
- You're fine, I'm fine, we're all fine.

767
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,116
- Yeah, we're just not great.

768
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,585
- Nope.

769
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,853
- Go Sox!

770
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,556
Yankees suck!

771
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,660
(whimsical piano music)

772
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,696
- Well, I'm gonna be a cop.

773
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,603
- And I'm gonna be an adult.

774
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,582
- [Sophia Voiceover] One piece of bread.

775
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,016
Two piece of bread.

776
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:35,919
Three. - Sophia.

777
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,387
- [Sophia Voiceover] I want to kill myself.

778
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,255
- Rabbi.

779
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,724
- How are you, my dear?

780
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,794
- Same as always.

781
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,330
- Same as always, same as always.

782
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,733
Consistency is a very undervalued quality.

783
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,168
- [Sophia Voiceover] How do I kill myself?

784
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,070
Maybe move to Russia so that Vladimir Putin

785
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,571
can do it for me.

786
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,639
- I've been thinking of you, my dear.

787
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,908
- [Sophia Voiceover] Die, American faggot.

788
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,711
No, no, no, I kill you, you American faggot.

789
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,112
- Can I help you? - I kill you

790
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,981
with my bare hands.

791
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,550
- Listen, can you show me where the sour cream is?

792
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,384
I'm in kind of a rush, I have a--

793
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,318
- I'll walk you down.

794
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,920
- Sour cream emergency.

795
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:12,990
- Ah.

796
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,692
It's a pre-button, it's for a party this afternoon.

797
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,327
One of the children of the board,

798
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,363
and I had to get out of there,

799
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,700
so I offered, the mother had so much on her mind.

800
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,869
You should've seen her face when she realized

801
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,938
that she'd forgotten the sour cream.

802
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:35,746
And oh, one extra for Shabbat.

803
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,315
- By all means.

804
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:43,387
- You know it's a special Shabbat.

805
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,254
- Is it?

806
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,225
- Your grandmother invited me.

807
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,726
I thought that was kind of her.

808
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,827
- Yeah?

809
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,462
She likes to feed people.

810
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,764
Like barn animals.

811
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,135
- You look like you could use one.

812
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,603
- Oh yeah, thanks.

813
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:02,105
Oh, oh jeez.

814
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:05,709
Thanks.

815
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,513
Can't have too much sour cream.

816
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,015
- Ew.

817
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,133
- [Sam] Pinsky.

818
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,903
- What are you doing here?

819
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,771
- I came to grab a can, mostly say hi,

820
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,873
make sure you're not dead and such.

821
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,308
- Nope, not dead.

822
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,609
- You off?

823
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,778
- Yeah, I got dinner with the Soviets.

824
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,646
- Take notes.

825
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,616
- I'll just be wallowing in my own self-pity,

826
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,454
while I stuff my face with some soup and meat and wine.

827
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,023
- Which way you headed?

828
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:54,925
Same.

829
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,463
What's in the box?

830
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,597
- Napoleon.

831
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,132
- I love that shit.

832
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,501
- You want some, it's for Shabbat, fuck it.

833
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,555
- You got something on your face.

834
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,801
This cake.

835
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,607
- What?

836
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,342
- Nothing.

837
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:55,752
- Hey!

838
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:00,757
How much?

839
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,728
- Hi.

840
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,299
- Going home? - Yeah.

841
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,300
- Want a ride?

842
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,601
- No, it's okay.

843
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,671
- What, are you gonna walk the whole way there?

844
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,039
Get in the car.

845
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,174
- [Victor] Are you sure?

846
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,975
- Get in the freaking car, Vicky.

847
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,546
- Okay.

848
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,556
(horn honks)

849
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,590
- Alright, go ahead.

850
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,359
Thanks.

851
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,227
Jerk.

852
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,343
I have something to tell you.

853
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,314
I'm pretty sure that it's meant to be,

854
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,683
because you're in my car.

855
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,617
(laughs)

856
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,519
- Since I'm in your car?

857
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,386
- Mmhm.

858
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:09,759
Since I saw you walking near Harbor Street out of nowhere.

859
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,796
- KK, I live near Harbor Street.

860
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,332
- Whatever, Vicky, just listen, okay?

861
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,199
- Okay.

862
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,240
- I'm a virgin.

863
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,412
- You are?

864
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:32,883
I didn't know.

865
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:42,559
- I'm a virgin, and I know that you know

866
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:48,365
that I know that you're a virgin, too.

867
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,906
(moans)

868
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,410
But you don't have to be ashamed.

869
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,012
- I am not ashamed.

870
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,483
- Oh yeah, mama.

871
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,927
(moans)

872
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,939
(sighs)

873
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,882
- I think we're meant to be together, Victor.

874
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,250
I just know it.

875
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,395
- Oh shit, let's go.

876
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,983
(phone rings)

877
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,331
Don't be such a scrotum.

878
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,637
Just get up here, I need you to help me set some boundaries.

879
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,715
What's your problem?

880
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,583
- Look, I wanted to do it, but I can't.

881
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,651
- What's wrong?

882
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,019
- I just don't want to.

883
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:23,987
- Because why?

884
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,822
- I feel sick, I can't do it, okay?

885
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,057
- What?

886
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,359
- And this is so evil.

887
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:31,761
- Evil?

888
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:32,862
- Yeah, they're making this big meal in there,

889
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,297
and you're gonna shit all over it,

890
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,500
because you can't get over childhood or whatever?

891
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,637
- Why are you making this all about you?

892
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,906
- We've known each other since the fucking womb,

893
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,442
and still, you couldn't give a shit about me.

894
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,545
We go with years without speaking,

895
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,680
because you treat me like I'm some kind of cousin

896
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,116
that has nothing in common with you.

897
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,251
But I'm the one who's gonna remember

898
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:58,555
every catastrophic family dinner, every slight,

899
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,957
every word that comes out of your mouth.

900
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,796
I know your family, I know you.

901
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,366
And you know we're all important,

902
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,935
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

903
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,209
Hello.

904
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,812
- I'm just thinking.

905
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,180
- Thinking what?

906
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,917
- Thinking what Catherine would've thought of that speech.

907
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:28,785
- Catherine who?

908
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,758
Okay, fine, I made her up.

909
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,359
- Just stop talking. - I'm sorry.

910
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,627
- So stop. - No, it's fine,

911
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,362
it's just, I didn't want things to get weird

912
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,931
between us pretending, so I made something up.

913

- Weird?

914
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,568
What could get weird?

915
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,737
- You know what could get weird.

916
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,777
- Just leave.

917
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,512
- I don't wanna leave now, I'm not done talking.

918
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,846

919

I'm not a stranger, Sophia.

927
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:39,956

- That's a shame.

948

949

950
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,966
- Trevor, what's your problem?

951
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,234
- I don't have a problem.

952
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,639
- Nope. - Yes.

953
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,908
- They can deal with that themself later.

954

955

- Fine.

956

- So are you gonna get yourself a new dance partner?

957
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,822
- Man proposes, God dispose.

958
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,859
- Well, he doesn't give you much, does he?

959
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,861
- I have a lot on my mind.

960
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:02,565
- He's clinically depressed, like all Pinsky men.

961

962

- Trevor, why don't you tell everybody

964
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,440
about the concert we went to the other night, at Tops.

965
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,542
Do you like music concerts, Sophia?

966
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,611
- Do I like music concerts?

967
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,715
Music concerts, could you be a little more specific?

968
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:19,949
- Don't be a jerk.

969
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,718
- What's with the grape juice, bro?

970
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,089
- I went to an AA meeting today.

971
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,124
- Is there something wrong with the car?

972
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,094
- AA.

973
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,428
- Not Triple A.

974
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,735
Bob, it's time.

975
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,072
- Marinachka, I don't think Victor was done talking.

976

- I actually do have something to share.

977
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,214
- Let me just jump right in.

978
01:00:55,284 --> 01:01:00,390
I remember picking up Marina on behalf of the temple

979
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,859
when she arrived from Russia, right at the airport.

980
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,295
Victor, you were just a few feet tall.

981
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,563
It was a long time ago.

982
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,867
I'm glad you started your recovery.

983
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,069
I'm proud of you, son.

984
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,505
I was still married then.

985
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,109
Marina hardly spoke a lick of English.

986
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:22,879
You were so young.

987
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,917
I wanna tell everyone right now,

988
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,922
your grandmother and I are seeing each other.

989
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,826
- I'm dating the Rabbi.

990
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,960
(laughs)

991
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,229
- Well, Kiki and I are gonna have sex later,

992
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,864
so good for us.

993
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,733

998

I wish for this relationship to be blessed.

1003

To be serene.

1004
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:29,138
To be full of love and appreciation.

1005
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:34,143
Kindness, romance, lovemaking.

1006

I hope that this relationship

1007
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:44,987

1008

- Yeah, Sophia and I are having issues.

1011
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,836

1012

You just said you are dating our Rabbi?

1017

01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,239
when I was seven years old.

1086
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:39,942
You know,

1087
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:46,115
BB came to my palace a few weeks ago.

1088
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,550
Yeah, he did.

1089
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,620
And we danced,

1090
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:55,357
we danced the whole night away, together.

1091
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,226
And I listened, I could hear his heart,

1092
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,728
because he's not a heartless man.

1093
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,063
He's a hero.

1094
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,100
I listened to that man's heart

1095
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,770
as he danced me all the way into my bed.

1096
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:14,944
As he danced me, I heard that beating beautiful heart.

1097
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,148
And he held me all night long.

1098
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:21,951
Caressed me.

1099
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:24,286
Held me tight.

1100
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,168
Okay.

1101
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,006
Maybe I'm a little bit bisexual.

1102
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,611
(crowd laughs and applauds)

1103
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:49,545
Just maybe.

1104
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:53,048
(polka music)

1105
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,852
Thank you.

1106
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:00,723
(singing in foreign language)
