1
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:25,231
(spooky piano music)

2
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:53,919
Good evening.

3
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:57,296
Welcome to the gamble.

4
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,891
I'm sure you're
all familiar with

5
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:02,334
the hood horror stories of old,

6
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:08,065
Blacula, Bones, People
Under the Stairs,

7
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,280
Tales From the Hood,
and (laughs) Candy Man.

8
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,415
But I'm willing to bet
that you've never heard

9
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,155
of this particular story before.

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,688
This is the tell of the
first black serial killer

11
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:30,395
to ever don a mask.

12
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:35,334
His name is Bitch Ass.

13
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:38,271
This is a story of revenge.

14
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:44,277
A story of nightmarish tales
in which the stakes are no less

15
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,313
than your very lives.

16
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:55,013
Are you willing
to play? (laughs)

17
00:01:55,048 --> 00:02:02,460
Good, good. Let the
story begin. (laughs)

18
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,627
(thunder crashes)

19
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:07,828
(eerie piano music)

20
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:16,276
(television clicks)
(static crackles)

21
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,045
(eerie suspenseful music)

22
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,544
(sirens wailing)

23
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,780
(woman breathing heavily)
(footsteps thumping)

24
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,266
(dog barking)

25
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,805
(eerie suspenseful music)

26
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,352
Why you running?
(woman screams)

27
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,013
Do you know who I am?

28
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:08,421
Give me what's in your bag.
- No!

29
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,521
I said give me what's in
your bag and you can go.

30
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:10,786
No.

31
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,084
- Bitch, you know who I am?
- I don't care.

32
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:12,755
I'm X, with the
sixth street gang.

33
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,086
I don't care.

34
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,252
Girl, you need to learn
some fucking manners.

35
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,363
(woman spits)

36
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,430
Bitch, you know who I am!
(girl screams)

37
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,761
(punch thuds)

38
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:19,795
Hey, you ain't gonna
hit me like no bitch, man.

39
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,829
(punch thuds)

40
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:22,798
Yo, you just knocked
my fucking tooth out.

41
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,865
(punch thuds)
(X groans)

42
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,296
Ouch, mother fucker, get off.

43
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:27,374
Get off of me!

44
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,507
You know who I'm with?

45
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,267
Sixth street gang,
mother fucker.

46
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:33,303
Get off me, get
off me. (screams)

47
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,579
(door thuds)

48
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:38,352
(scary dramatic music)

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,317
(high intensity techno music)

50
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:48,956
(Q breathing heavily)

51
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,991
(puzzle cube clicking)

52
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,585
You're late Q.

53
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:15,389
Sorry.

54
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,018
You're sorry.

55
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,531
Can anyone tell me what the
deadliest animal in Africa is?

56
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,325
Lion

57
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,502
Tiger

58
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,536
Elephant

59
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:33,902
No.

60
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,301
What about you, Q?

61
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:40,876
It's the hippo.

62
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:47,080
It's the hippo. (laughs)

63
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:51,557
(claps) That is correct.
Can anybody tell me why?

64
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:58,058
It is because mother
fuckers underestimate,

65
00:05:58,896 --> 00:05:59,895
the hippo.

66
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,067
You see, all they see is some
cute cuddly fat ass water cow.

67
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,774
And they get up and
they get too close.

68
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:13,546
(fist slams on table)

69
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,483
(laughs) You're fucking dead.

70
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:19,310
(heart pumping)

71
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,621
Is that what you're doing?
Underestimating me.

72
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,657
No.

73
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,593
That's good, because
underestimating me

74
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,760
can be just as fucking deadly.

75
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:33,291
(intense eerie music)

76
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,933
Damn tonight, is y'all's
six, six, six night.

77
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:44,005
20 years ago today,
it was my initiation.

78
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:49,274
So, as a little
anniversary celebration,

79
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:52,453
I got a special
task for the group.

80
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:55,313
A rich old bitch down the street

81
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,557
done finally kicked the bucket.

82
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:00,923
The wicked bitch is dead.

83
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,530
Back in my day, rumor had it,

84
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:07,666
she had money and all
types of rich lady shit

85
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,668
stashed away in the house.

86
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:10,636
So, you

87
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:12,968
are gonna break in

88
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,399
and rob the place.

89
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,112
What, Moo?

90
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,718
If there's money in there,

91
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:28,654
how come you never
got it before?

92
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,188
Put your hand down.

93
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:41,326
Robbing old people is fucked up.

94
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,999
Do you think I'm a monster?

95
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:47,167
Um no, naw.

96
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,403
But what about her grandson?
Doesn't he still live there?

97
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,208
[Moo] I heard that
guy worships the devil.

98
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:58,915
Sacrifices animals
and shit like this.

99
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,721
Nah, man, he kidnaps
people and eats them.

100
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:04,657
On some cannibal shit.

101
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,661
Little Bobby, Fat Kevin, Cross
eyed Keisha and Lil' Vernon.

102
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,520
And what about X?

103
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:11,895
He's been missing
for a week and last

104
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,490
anybody's saw him
was over by that house.

105
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,734
Hey, hey, hey,
stop this bull shit.

106
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,870
I grew up with that fat fuck.

107
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,577
Trust me, when I tell
you, he's a bitch.

108
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:25,579
I ain't afraid of him.

109
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,241
Shit, I know you ain't, nephew.

110
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:34,115
We gonna go in that house.
And we gonna handle that shit.

111
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,315
Good,

112
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:39,318
and when y'all done,

113
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,321
come back here

114
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,389
and I will give you

115
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,733
your first cut.

116
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,232
And then, you will officially

117
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:57,468
be members of sixth street.

118
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,470
(laughs)

119
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:02,473
All right, y'all get
the fuck out of here.

120
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,149
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, Q.

121
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,758
Hey look, man, all
this running late shit.

122
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,595
That's got to stop.

123
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,764
Yeah. I'm sorry, Spade.

124
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,096
I had school.

125
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,295
You had school?

126
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,068
Hey, is school putting
money in your pocket?

127
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,267
(suspenseful music)

128
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,741
Goddamn, I'm trying
to help you, man,

129
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,677
but you're not making that easy.

130
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,273
You and your moms,
y'all struggling, right?

131
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,683
Damn man, she's working two
jobs?

132
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,311
You want to help her?

133
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,412
Man, you get serious
about this crew,

134
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,821
you could put some real
money in her pocket.

135
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,626
Go ahead.

136
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:54,459
Yeah, okay, I got it.

137
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,802
All right.
Don't come back till it's done.

138
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:05,602
Hey, it has been a minute
since X came around.

139
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,536
You know anything?

140
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:12,686
Naw, nothing yet.
But X, that kid's stupid.

141
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:16,316
I figured he just got picked
up snatching purses again.

142
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,890
Damn, I told him to stop
doing that petty shit.

143
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,059
All right, if you hear
something, you let me know.

144
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,159
I got you.

145
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,459
(apprehensive rap music)

146
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,967
[Tuck] Shit, I don't
know about y'all.

147
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,134
I can't wait to go to the beach.

148
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,708
Catch some sunsets
and shit, ball out.

149
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,810
[Cricket] Nigga, sunsets?

150
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,713
[Tuck] Yeah, so what.

151
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:42,672
[Cricket] Man with my cut.
I'm trying to marry my girl.

152
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:45,884
So, if y'all find an engagement
ring in there, give it here.

153
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,984
Ya feel me?

154
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,184
(backpack thuds)
- Shit, oh, fuck.

155
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,384
Hey man, why is Q
Ball coming tonight?

156
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,992
Yeah man, he's whack.
Punk's just gonna slow us down.

157
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:57,654
He's fine.
He with me.

158
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,799
Y'all need to worry
about y'all selves.

159
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:03,704
You ready?

160
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,037
Bro, I don't know, man.

161
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,006
What you mean, you don't know?

162
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,942
Haven't I always
looked out for you?

163
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,042
Yeah.

164
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,747
Made sure nobody
messing with you.

165
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,673
Yeah.

166
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,114
And when we got
caught shoplifting,

167
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,951
who took the blame for that?

168
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:20,952
You did.

169
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:22,184
That's right?

170
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:24,417
Cause you like a brother
to me, man.

171
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,717
Now I need you to have my back.

172
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:30,291
Wait, why the locks on
the outside of the house?

173
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:31,798
Old lady had dementia

174
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,723
and would wonder the streets
in the middle of the night.

175
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,660
Yo, I think I see
something in the window.

176
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:38,970
You think that's him?

177
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:45,372
(pager beeps)
- Ah! Oh shit!

178
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,243
Relax man.
It's just my pager.

179
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,445
Oh, shit, it's my mom.

180
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,087
Hey yo, look, I gotta go.
She's gonna flip out.

181
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:59,485
I think your momma fine as hell.

182
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,323
Shit, me too, actually.

183
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,722
Thanks. I guess.

184
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,867
(creepy keyboard music)
- All right, I'm out.

185
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,774
Yo Q, make sure you
be here at midnight.

186
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,506
20 he don't show.

187
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,309
40.

188
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,851
Don't worry. He'll be here.

189
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:29,317
(eerie screechy music)

190
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:33,893
(gate squeaks)

191
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,755
(eerie somber music)

192
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,933
(door creeks)

193
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,693
(door clicks)

194
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,465
Mom?

195
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:50,272
Mom, I thought you quit.

196
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,978
I thought you were
supposed to be home on time.

197
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,277
Mom.

198
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:56,311
Don't, mom, me.

199
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,050
I want you to explain to me

200
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,481
why I have to page
you to come home.

201
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:03,857
On 6, 6, 6 night, no less.

202
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:07,421
You know how dangerous that is?

203
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:13,295
Sorry, I stopped by
a friend's house and

204
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,835
I lost track of time.

205
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,696
Whose? Tucks?

206
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:21,138
No, it was.

207
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,007
Quentin.

208
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:27,144
We're gonna pick this
conversation up later.

209
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,608
Right now, you have company.

210
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,352
Ms. Jacobs.

211
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:41,554
Quentin, hey, yeah I wanted
to come by and talk to you.

212
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,162
This is delicious, Miss Gatson.

213
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:46,933
- Oh, call me Marsia.
- Mm

214
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:49,562
Is this about the scholarship?

215
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:52,268
Yes.

216
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:54,600
So I got it?

217
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:57,911
No.

218
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,079
But, you said I was a shoe-in.

219
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,886
I know, but truth is
I say that to everyone.

220
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:09,615
Excuse me?

221
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,123
I got to tell them something
to get them to apply.

222
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,520
You understand?

223
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:16,886
But, there's gotta be
more that I can apply for.

224
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:17,964
Let's face it.

225
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,758
Your grades are good,
but not great.

226
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,036
It's not like you're
trying to be a doctor.

227
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,666
I am trying to be a doctor.

228
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,569
Oh.

229
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,409
I think it's time you leave.

230
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:37,115
Before I go, where can
I get the recipe for this?

231
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,877
I bought it at the store.

232
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:45,156
Ooh, I got to go to
that store. (laughs)

233
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:48,753
(eerie humming music)

234
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,624
(dishes clanking)

235
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:01,073
Man, why do I gotta do dishes?

236
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,272
I didn't even eat.

237
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:04,505
I don't recall that
being a requirement.

238
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,610
Maybe now you can tell me why
you came in my house late.

239
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:14,812
We talked about this Q.

240
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,991
I do not want you hanging
out with Spade and those

241
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:19,454
sixth street ass-holes.

242
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,621
Spade's not a bad guy.
He's just looking out for me.

243
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,590
Okay, that's the way it seems.

244
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,593
But Spade is always
looking out for himself.

245
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,792
No, he's just

246
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,167
I grew up with
people like Spade.

247
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,532
You are not like them.

248
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,172
You are going to college.

249
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:39,177
Come on mom, you
heard Ms. Jacobs.

250
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,148
Okay, Q.

251
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,745
I'm sorry about
the scholarship baby,

252
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,188
but I don't give a
damn what she said.

253
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:55,952
Maybe I could just
get a job and you know,

254
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:58,295
earn some money and
I'll do college later.

255
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,033
No, Quentin,

256
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:05,170
because later becomes never.

257
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,012
I will figure out a
way to pay for college.

258
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:17,710
I don't care if I have to
work a third and a fourth job.

259
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,085
I'll take care of it.

260
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,683
Thanks mom.

261
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,852
I love you.

262
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,064
I love you too.

263
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,629
Does this mean I don't
have to put away any dishes?

264
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,798
(both laugh)

265
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:41,734
I'll tell you what.

266
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:46,277
I'll play you for it.

267
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:47,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:49,676
All right, let's go.

269
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:52,085
- 1, 2, 3, shoot.
- 1, 2, 3, shoot.

270
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,217
I got you.

271
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:56,782
Yeah, you know I
let you win, right?

272
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,785
- No you didn't.
- You didn't win.

273
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,229
(eerie humming music)

274
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,960
(jar clanks)

275
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:23,083
(jar thuds)

276
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:27,912
Oh shit.

277
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:34,655
(spooky tech music)

278
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:39,396
I knew your boy
was gonna bitch out.

279
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:41,299
Shit, more money for us.

280
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:46,238
Shut up, he'll be here.
We good?

281
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,734
Yeah, yeah, I'm just saying.

282
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,604
We ain't got all night.
You know?

283
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,344
You late.

284
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,071
My bad.

285
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:55,940
You good?

286
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,283
Yeah, I'm good.

287
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,484
If all the windows
and doors are locked,

288
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,683
how are we gonna get in?

289
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:05,455
Don't trip.
I can pick locks.

290
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,985
No, you can't, fucking liar.

291
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,261
Of course I can.

292
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,361
I learned it from mom.

293
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:14,090
Right there.
There's your locked door.

294
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,860
Show me.

295
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,125
No, wait a minute, okay,

296
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,995
maybe we should just
- I got you. I got you.

297
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,864
I got you.

298
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:21,834
He can pick locks?

299
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:25,178
Hell no, he can't.
His uncle's in jail.

300
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:29,446
[Moo] Shit, ouch.
Ouch, shit.

301
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,679
(Cricket, Q and Tuck sigh)

302
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,288
Couldn't pick it.

303
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,619
Stupid ass.

304
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:39,324
Let's go around the back.

305
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,053
(eerie suspenseful music)

306
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,179
What's up?

307
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:02,545
What do you thinks in there?

308
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,646
Who cares?
It's the Gushinson house.

309
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,319
[Cricket] Hey yo, I
think I found a way in.

310
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,782
[Tuck] Come on.

311
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:16,053
(door squeaks)

312
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,697
Moo, go in there.

313
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:25,205
Man, what if they got
raccoons in there man.

314
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,671
I don't want rabies.
90% of raccoons got rabies.

315
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:31,442
That's a fact.

316
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:32,311
Move.

317
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,907
I'll do it.

318
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:45,423
(tense suspenseful music)

319
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,186
[Grandma] What is your
new game called again?

320
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,189
It's called Shopopoly.
It's life Monopoly.

321
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:54,696
But instead of hotels
you buy snacks.

322
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:56,863
Leave it to you to invent a game

323
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,700
where you get to buy snacks.

324
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:00,438
(Cecil & Grandma laugh)

325
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:02,231
Good old snacks.

326
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,937
(dice clanking)

327
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,249
(game piece tapping)

328
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:14,815
Where did you get this piece?

329
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,048
The museum room.
Grandma, you're hurting me.

330
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,018
That belonged to your Grandpa.

331
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:22,922
You aren't supposed
to touch them.

332
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:25,331
I'm sorry, Grandma.

333
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,564
You disobeyed me, Cecil.

334
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,732
No, I said, I said, I'm sorry.

335
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,965
Pain is penance,

336
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:35,264
and penance

337
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,265
(lighter clicks)

338
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,838
Is a gift to God.

339
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:41,105
No, no! (screams)

340
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,811
(flame sizzling)

341
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:47,287
(intense spooky music)

342
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,039
Damn,

343
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,844
look at all the board games.

344
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,615
This some hoarder shit.

345
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,848
[Tuck] Nah, this
shit is fucked is up.

346
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,455
[Moo] Woo.

347
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,621
You found something?

348
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:25,457
Yeah.

349
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,458
What?

350
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,525
Mouse trap.

351
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,219
So.

352
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,528
So we could play it after.

353
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,025
You too stupid to play the game.

354
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,960
(tense dramatic music)

355
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,225
Yo, you find a way out here?

356
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,832
[Q] I think so.
There's some stairs up here.

357
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:39,372
[Tuck] Watch your ass.

358
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:43,002
If you knock anything down,
they're gonna know we down here.

359
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,353
(cards thumping)

360
00:21:56,688 --> 00:22:00,459
(spooky suspenseful music)

361
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:06,366
Jesus Christ.

362
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,369
Man, I told y'all this
place was creepy.

363
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,229
I bet you they got some
nice plasmas around here.

364
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,869
We ain't here for the TV man.

365
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:16,871
[Q] So what's the plan?

366
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:19,368
Cricket, you stay
here on the first floor.

367
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:21,205
Me and Q gonna go
to the second floor.

368
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,339
And Moo, you go to the basement.

369
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:24,714
Why the fuck I gotta
go to the basement

370
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:25,946
and you get to go upstairs?

371
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:28,718
Cause I'm the one that got this.

372
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:30,522
What the fuck is that?

373
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,249
If his bitch ass wakes up,

374
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,493
I'm gonna make sure
he go back down.

375

Gotcha. (laughs)
It ain't even loaded.

378
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,073
Don't play like that.

379
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:58,176
Relax, man.
We just having a little fun.

380
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:01,949
All right. Split up.
Let's get this shit done.

381
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:05,051
(stair creaking)

382
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:08,285
(eerie somber music)

383
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,371
Hey, you go in there.

384
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,145
Come get me if you anything.

385
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,955
[Moo] Hey Moo, why don't
you go down to the basement?

386
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:44,761
Why don't you go down
to the basement, bitch.

387
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:47,192
Damn, I should have said that.

388
00:23:54,707 --> 00:23:56,366
(light clicks)

389
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:03,549
Yo.

390
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:09,049
(plastic crinkling)

391
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:12,492
What the fuck?

392
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:22,700
Huh, this is one creepy
mother fucker here.

393
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,097
(light thuds)

394
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,067
Tuck?
Cricket is that you?

395
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,071
If that's you, I'm gonna
beat the shit out of you.

396
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:34,547
(scary dramatic music)

397
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:41,521
Yo, who's there?

398

(door creaks)

402
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,667
(door clicks)

403
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,751
I get it.
Y'all like Jesus.

404
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,769
Thou shall not disobey.

405
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,562
Thou shall not swear.

406
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,773
Thou shall not drink.
- [Grandma]<i> The most important</i>

407
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,104
Thou shall not do drugs.

408
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:11,468
[Grandma]<i> Thou shall not lust</i>.

409
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,843
[Cecil] She's just my friend.

410
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:15,406
That little trollop means
to corrupt you, Cecil.

411
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,278
Tempt you, and I won't allow it.

412
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:21,313
No, she's an angel.

413
00:26:22,118 --> 00:26:23,623
Hand me the switch.

414
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,691
Grandma.

415
00:26:25,726 --> 00:26:26,791
The switch.

416
00:26:29,158 --> 00:26:31,829
I, I won't talk to her anymore.

417
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:37,131
I wish I could
believe that, Cecil.

418
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,463
I really do.

419
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,741
Hand it to me.

420
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:57,888
Now, take off your shirt.
(music intensifies)

421
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:04,059
(stick thumps)

422
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:08,294
This is for your own good.
(stick thumps)

Ahh!

424
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:13,563
(Grandma grunts)
Ahh!

425
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,173
This whole family is crazy.

426
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,849
(suspenseful music)

427
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:31,350
Whoa.

428
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,355
A black cat?

429
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,930
What they want bad luck?

430
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,364
A dinosaur.

431
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,775
How the fuck they
get that up in here?

432
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:52,811
This shit is wild.

433
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:58,883
Come on lady, where'd
you put all the good stuff?

434
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:00,951
All right.

435
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:09,894
(paper rustling)

436
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:13,293
[Moo] Yo, help!
Help!

437
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,868

438
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,069

(sinister dramatic music)

440
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,635
Yo, what kind of shit
is going on, man?

441
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,669
What you do with X?

442
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:30,750
Yo, what kind of
shit is this man?

443
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,576
Help!

444
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:34,512
Help!

445
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:39,990
(lever creaks)

446
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:44,621
Do you like games?

447
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:46,590
[Moo] Just let me go.

448
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,231
I call this surgeon.
(electricity crackling)

449
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,905
Remove the body
parts with the tongs.

450
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,170
Fuck you.

451
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:57,535
Grandma didn't like cursing.

452
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:01,605
You will get a chance to
play me for your life.

453
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:06,445
First, with three misses, dies.

454
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,714
No you fucking retard.

455
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:15,025
(bones cracking)

456
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,290
Ahh!

457
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,492
I said no cursing.

458
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,464
All right.

459
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,005
I should go first.

460
00:29:42,923 --> 00:29:45,319
(Moo coughs)

461
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,125
- Mm mm. Mm mm.
- Your turn.

462
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,654
All right.

463
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:51,996
I got it.

464
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:56,360

(electricity buzzing)
(Moo screaming)

466
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,082
I forgot to mention,

467
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:14,953
don't touch the sides.

468
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:18,616
Hold up.

469
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:23,654
Hey, Queen Cricket.

470
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,822
Hey, that's why
bitches want kick it.

471
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:29,869
But I'm in this house
looking for some riches.

472
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:33,334
Man, that was dope.

473
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,831
I gotta remember
to write that down.

474
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,535
(electricity buzzing)

475
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,338

479
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,948
(electricity buzzing)

480
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:16,806
Fuck!

481
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:29,852
(tongs crashing)

482
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,065
I ain't playing no more.

483
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,431
It seems you have forfeited.

484
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:39,433
(lever thuds)

485
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:42,139
(electricity crackles)
(Moo screams)

486
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:45,142

487
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:52,248
Thanks for playing.

491
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,144
Psst, rich people and
some fake ass flowers.

492
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,911
(somber music)

493
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:37,491
Hold up.

494
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,824
Um, black Jesus,
please don't judge me.

495
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:44,234
A sister just trying
to get paid. (laughs)

496
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:47,171
(footsteps thumping)

497
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:54,079

(Cricket mumbling)

498
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:58,842

(footsteps clacking)

500
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:04,012
Did you hear that?

501
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:04,848
Yeah.

502
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:07,620
Wait.

503
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,062
Wait, wait.

504
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:10,887
What?

505
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,163
What do you want me to do?

506
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,660
Just stay here.
I'm gonna go check it out.

507

(stairs creaking)

508
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,134
Cricket.

509
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,279

(stairs squeaking)

515
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:03,115
What's up?

516
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,282
Nothing.
Those two got spooked

517
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:07,152
and took off like some bitches.

518
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:08,252
They left?

519
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,321
What are we gonna do?

520
00:34:11,356 --> 00:34:12,586
What we came here to do.

521
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:15,919
We gonna get this money.
Come on.

522
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,331
Come on, man.

Help!

528
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,632
Why you doing this?

529
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,306
What do you want from me?

530
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:04,704
To play?

531
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:10,072
And if I win?

532
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:14,010
[Bitch Ass] You get to leave.

533
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:16,815
Deal.

534
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:20,984
(knives clanking)

535
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,627
Lucky for me,

536
00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:29,366
(block thuds)

537
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,665
This my game.

538
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:38,342
(sheets rustling)

539
00:35:40,841 --> 00:35:43,941
All right.
Where is this shit at?

540
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:48,352
Yeah, right there.

541
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,782
Fucking jackpot.

542

(blocks thud)

543
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:13,443
(giggles) Looks like
they're no more pieces.

544
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,039
Guess it's a tie.

545
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,681
I guess we both leave. (laughs)

546
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:23,255
There are no ties.

547
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,147
Now we use our hands.

548
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,151
(sinister music)

549
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,065
No.

550
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,872
No, nah I ain't doing that man.

551
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:49,908
(Cricket gasping)

552
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:56,816
I'll play.

553
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:01,392
I'll play. (coughs)

554
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,154
(sinister music intensifies)

555
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,420
No, no, no, god no!
- You lost.

556
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,752
(Cricket screams)

557
00:37:31,787 --> 00:37:33,853
Please, no!
No!

558
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:36,823
(blood dripping)

559
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,958
(bell gongs)

560
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:47,064
(eerie suspenseful music)

561
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,037
God.

562
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,974
I mean no disrespect.

563
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:03,817
(metal clanking)

564
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:14,223
(hinges squeaking)

565
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:24,376
This is fucking junk.

566
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:30,107
Yeah, this is some
Titanic shit right here.

567
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,421
(water dripping)

568
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,021
Q?

569
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:46,530
You taking a piss, nigga?

570
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,534
Q?

571
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:05,208
(tense thrilling music)

572
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,374
Moo.

573
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,584
Moo.

574
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,278
Moo, man.

575
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,554
Wake up.
Wake up.

576
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:18,562
(door thudding)
(Tuck grunting)

577
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:28,231
(eerie music)

578
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,623
Junk.

579
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:49,494
(papers rustling)

580
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,305
I spit somewhere
in your yearbook.

581
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,616
See if you can find it.
Gross.

582
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:18,050
Hey, Bitch Ass, hope you
drown this summer, Jayden.

583
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,956
Kill yourself, Juan.

584
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:25,629
Jesus.

585
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:36,299
What the fuck.
Mom, you knew Bitch Ass?

586
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:39,709
(upbeat music)

587
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:44,516
[Man] I know him.
I don't know this fool.

588
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:47,046
Hey, Hey.
Check me out bro.

589
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,721
Hey Bitch Ass, you playing
a little game over there?

590
00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:54,449
(group laughing)

591
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:55,692
Shaking in his boots.

592
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:58,486
Hey, hey bro, you heard me?

593
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:01,533
Hey, why don't you
play with us Bitch Ass?

594
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,799
Are you afraid you're
gonna ruin your little suit?

595
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,570
(group laughing)

596
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:06,604
This dude.

597
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:12,742
Hey Cecil, hey.

598
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,075
Forget those guys.

599
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,144
Don't let them bother you.
They're idiots.

600
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:21,685
(puzzle cube clicks)

601
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,554
What's that?

602
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,020
It's a puzzle cube.

603
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,088
You like games, huh?

604
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,487
Yeah, I do.

605
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:35,061
I play them all the time
with my grandmother.

606
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,734
So how many games you got?

607
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:41,738
300.
Maybe more.

608
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:45,038
Damn, that's a lot of games.

609
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:47,843
I, I built a game
house in my backyard.

610
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:50,109
I make my own games
back there and

611
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:53,310
that's what I want
to go to college for.

612
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,279
That's cool.

613
00:41:56,788 --> 00:42:00,053
(gentle romantic music)

614
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:05,388
Would you like to come
over and play sometime?

615
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:07,566
Yeah.
Why not?

616
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,702
Boo.

617
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,737
Jesus.
That's not funny Spade.

618
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:18,269
Well, if it isn't
the spoiled rich boy

619
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:19,908
from down the street.

620
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:21,646
It's it's not like that.

621
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,274
Oh, I don't know, Bitch Ass.

622
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:25,881
You live in a big house and
your grandma drives a caddy.

623
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,586
Seem pretty fucking rich to me.

624
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:29,819
So what's going on here, Marsia?

625
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:33,317
Nothing, Cecil and I were
just talking about college.

626
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:34,549
You hear that, Boots?

627
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:36,320
He plans on leaving
us all behind.

628
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:38,256
Yo, maybe he thinking about
taking my girl with him.

629
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,896
- Spade it's not like that.
- Let him answer.

630
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:42,634
Is that what you're thinking?

631
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:45,329
No, I was asking
her if she wanted to

632
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:47,232
come over and play sometime.

633
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:48,937
You know she would never
go out with you, right?

634
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:50,136
Please stop.

635
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,643
Nah, this nigga need
to hear the truth.

636
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,239
She wouldn't fuck you
if you had a $20 bill

637
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,680
hanging out your zipper.

638
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:58,573
Lincoln couldn't get
your fat ass laid.

639
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:01,778
Abraham Lincoln is
on the five actually.

640
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:05,723
You like school?

641
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:08,726
Well, I'm about to
teach you a lesson.

642
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,795
Every action has consequences.

643
00:43:15,658 --> 00:43:18,197
(puzzle cube clicking)

644
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:20,804
Grandma says, thou
shall not steal.

645
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:21,838
What?

646
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:22,674
Give it back.

647
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:24,236
Oh shit.

648
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:28,009
Yo, fuck him up.
- Yo, you gonna die

649
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:31,540
you fat fuck.
(car horn honking)

650
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,311
Ooh, you're lucky
you're bitch grandma's

651
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:34,752
here to save your ass.

652
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:37,854
See you later, Bitch Ass.

653
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,955
We gonna get that
nigger later, bro.

654
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,957
Yo, why'd you
have to do all that.

655
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:43,552
Why you with him anyway?

656
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:47,325
(car door slams)

657
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:56,565
(ominous music)
(paper rustling)

658
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,907
Holy shit.

659
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:08,852
The crosses. (laughs)

660
00:44:12,055 --> 00:44:13,857
(floor creaks)

661
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:14,726
Tuck?

662
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:19,192
Tuck!

663
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:22,195
Man, where the fuck you at?

664
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,163
(tense ominous music)

665
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:27,266
(chains rattle)
(Tuck groans)

666
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,499
Get me the fuck out of here!

667
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,809
You know who you fucking with?

668
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:36,275
Do you know who
you fucking with?

669
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,609
(drill whirs)
(Tuck screams)

670
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:49,321
(Tuck breathing heavily)

671
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:53,897
(chains rattle)

672
00:44:58,761 --> 00:44:59,595
Your turn.

673
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:03,401
Don't touch the red.

674
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,041
(Tuck groans)

675
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:09,847

676
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,937
(Tuck groans)

677
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,541
(rope crackling)

678
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:48,017
Tuck.

679
00:45:49,856 --> 00:45:50,822
Tuck.

680
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:53,858
(suspenseful music)

681
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,872
(coins rattle)

682
00:46:07,907 --> 00:46:11,304
(intense eerie music)

683
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:20,544
(coins rattle)

684
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:35,790
(keys clank)

685
00:46:35,825 --> 00:46:37,594
(door creaks)

686
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,976
Damn it, Q.

687
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:49,507
(sinister dramatic music)

688
00:46:56,351 --> 00:46:58,714
Tuck, where are you man?

689
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,037
(lid clanks)

690
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,724
(ladder creaks)

691
00:47:55,575 --> 00:48:00,743
(eerie music)
(Tuck groaning)

692
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:11,996

694
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:30,949

696
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,267
(stick thuds)

697
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:55,963
(Tuck gurgling)
(Q stammering)

00:49:18,328 --> 00:49:21,692
(intense eerie music)

702
00:49:25,401 --> 00:49:26,598
[Q] No.

703
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:29,304
No.

704
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:30,833
No. no!

705
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,208
No!

706
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:37,213
Please, stop.
(panic hollering)

707
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,183
(body thuds)

708
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:43,549
(Q gasping and moaning)

709
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:59,070
(plastic crinkles)

710
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,403
(music abruptly stops)

711
00:50:02,438 --> 00:50:05,076
(bell gongs)

712
00:50:07,113 --> 00:50:09,377
(beads rattle)
- [Marsia] Where is Spade?

713
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,347
Hey, I told her
not to come in here.

714
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:13,612
It's all good.

715
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:17,715
Look who it is.

716
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:21,015
How can I help you?

717
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,688
Cut the shit, Spade.
Where the fuck is my son?

718
00:50:23,723 --> 00:50:24,887
You have a child?

719
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:27,230
You know who he is.

720
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:29,727
Yeah, I do know who he is.

721
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,960
It's too bad.

722
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,304
He is in the middle of
6, 6, 6 night right now.

723
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:36,965
My god, goddammit.

724
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,209
I told you to stay the
fuck away from him.

725
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,035
Hey, hey, it is not my fault,

726
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,807
your son doesn't
stay away from me.

727
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:46,612
He probably needs a
father figure in his life.

728
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,318
Who is his daddy, anyway?

729
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:50,286
Not you.

730
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,322
I bet his daddy's a bum.

731
00:50:53,357 --> 00:50:55,390
(Boots laughs)

732
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:58,723
I'd rather a bum
than a wanna be thug.

733
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:00,956
Hey, who you think
you talking to?

734
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,267
You cage nigga, back up.
(Spade laughs)

735
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:05,961
It's all good.

736
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:09,096
Listen, I'm a, I'm
gonna let that slide.

737
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:11,670
Cause you and I, we do
have history, right?

738
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:15,212
But hey, don't forget
who house you in.

739
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:20,250
Please tell me where my son is.

740
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:25,684
He is out, robbing
somebody's house right now.

741
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:31,195
Who's?

742
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,592
You gonna love this shit.

743
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:36,728
Wait for it (laughs)
hold on, Bitch Ass.

744
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,302
Cecil's fucking house.

745
00:51:39,337 --> 00:51:41,128
I forgot his name was Cecil.

746
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:42,437
Spade, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

747
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:43,966
Hasn't he suffered enough?

748
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:47,376
You fucking pathetic ass hole.

749
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,007
Who the fuck you
think you're talking to?

750
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,812
I told you to show me
some fucking respect.

751
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,321
I decide when somebody
has suffered enough.

752
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:02,391
I told your boy, Bitch
Ass, we was gonna be back.

753
00:52:02,426 --> 00:52:04,393
And I'm a man of
my fucking word.

754
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,028
Now, they should have
been back already.

755
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,371
And we was just about
to go check on that.

756
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:18,341
Would you like to roll?

757
00:52:23,513 --> 00:52:26,778
You just take me
to my fucking son.

758
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,716
Okay.

759
00:52:31,587 --> 00:52:33,752
Boots, grab that
heat and let's go.

760
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:36,920
You do see why I like
her though, right?

761
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,329
I don't get it.
That bitch mean.

762
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,297
It's the bald head.

763
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:45,159
(suspenseful music)

764
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:47,436
(Q groans)

765
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:55,169
(fist thuds)

766
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:57,710
[Spade] Let's hurry up
and get this kid, man.

767
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:06,455
Sure nobody in there?

768
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,621
Nope.

769
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:08,721
Is it locked?

770
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:09,821
[Boots] Yes.

771
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:12,593
You know what, just
kick the door in.

772
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:16,091
Wait, can we knock first?

773
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,092
And say what?

774
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,368
We sent some kids
here to rob you

775
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,336
have you seen them?

776
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,471
Hey, you wanna find Q or not?

777
00:53:23,606 --> 00:53:25,705
Okay, fine.

778
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,773
Just kick it down, man.

779
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:29,478
Back up.
- Oh.

780
00:53:29,513 --> 00:53:30,545
(door thuds)

781
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,414
[Spade] There it is.

782
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:38,487
Hey look, I know what
your grandma did to you.

783
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:41,919
It was fucked up, man.

784
00:53:42,493 --> 00:53:44,262
But you don't have to do this.

785
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,794
I saw your yearbook.

786
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:52,226
You knew my mom, Marsia.

787
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:55,273
(suspenseful music)

788
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:05,349
So, can I ask you
a weird question?

789
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:06,416
(ethereal music)

790
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,648
Yeah, I guess.

791
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:09,353
Yo, what's up with the suit.

792
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:12,818
Grandma says treat
every day, like Sunday

793
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:14,787
and the Lord will
always be with you.

794
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,327
It's kind of her saying.

795
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,825
Okay, I like that.

796
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,828
So uh, we're your parents?

797
00:54:24,326 --> 00:54:27,129
They died in a car
accident when I was little.

798
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:32,200
You know my parents
aren't around either.

799
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,840
I never really knew my
dad and my mom, well,

800
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:37,073
she ain't around.

801
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:40,351
Spade and his mom took me in.

802
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:42,177
They looked out for me.

803
00:54:42,685 --> 00:54:44,553
Is that why you with that jerk?

804
00:54:44,588 --> 00:54:47,358
No, I love him.

805
00:54:48,724 --> 00:54:51,285
You know, he's not
such a bad guy.

806
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,528
He just acts that way,

807
00:54:52,563 --> 00:54:54,024
cause his dad is the
leader of sixth street.

808
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:56,290
You know, we're gonna
get a place together

809
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:57,225
and get outta here.

810
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,096
If you say so.

811
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:04,199
So, why you like games so much?

812
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:08,907
Because anyone can play, it
doesn't matter who you are.

813
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:10,546
There's a game for everyone.

814
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,175
Okay, then what's your game?

815
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,518
All right.

816
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:19,687
Don't laugh.
Rock, paper, scissors.

817
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:22,019
Rock, paper, scissors.
Really?

818
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:23,823
Ain't that kind of boring?

819
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,055
I mean there's no board,

820
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,430
there's no pieces,
there ain't shit.

821
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:28,828
That's why it's great.
You can play it anywhere.

822
00:55:28,863 --> 00:55:31,160
Plus it's part
instinct, part luck,

823
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:34,537
which makes it the purest
game ever invented.

824
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:36,770
Okay, then let's do it.

825
00:55:36,805 --> 00:55:37,672
All right.

826
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,608
So we'll go 1, 2, 3.

827
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:41,335
Yeah, I got it.

828
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,380
All right.

829
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,911
1, 2, 3, shoot.

830
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:54,887
But, you don't have to do this.

831
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:00,563
(door thuds)

832
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:02,290
Man, you still smoke cigarettes?

833
00:56:03,964 --> 00:56:05,700
Shit gonna kill you.

834
00:56:05,735 --> 00:56:07,064
Shut up.

835
00:56:08,903 --> 00:56:11,904
(alarm buzzes)

836
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,609
Ladies first.

837
00:56:15,074 --> 00:56:16,579
Got a stank attitude.

838
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:19,615
Just need to get in here and
find my baby, stop playing.

839
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,947
[Spade] Always did wanna
come inside this house.

840
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:22,981
[Marsia] Spade!

841
00:56:23,016 --> 00:56:24,488
[Spade] Let's go upstairs, man.

842
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:27,623
(alarm buzzes)

843
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:29,592
Wait, hey, wait!

844
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:31,462
Hey wait!
Let me go!

845
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:42,231
(eerie suspenseful music)
(door creaks)

846
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:43,001
Q?

847
00:56:46,512 --> 00:56:47,170
Where is he?

848
00:56:47,205 --> 00:56:48,578
Will you chill out?

849
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,777
Look, maybe they left already

850
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:51,647
or just waiting for
us back at the house.

851
00:56:51,682 --> 00:56:53,176
Well, then where is Cecil?

852
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:55,079
Yeah, the hell if I know.

853
00:56:55,114 --> 00:56:57,851
His bitch ass probably ran
away or he hiding somewhere.

854
00:56:57,886 --> 00:57:00,051
Why do you hate him so much?

855
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:02,625
Because he disrespected me.

856
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,960
(Marsia sighs)

857
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,004
Oh god.

858
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,483
I remember this photo.

859
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,052
It was before you were so
concerned about respect.

860
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:35,658
Outta here, man.

861
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:44,997
I miss this kid.

862
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:48,363
Help me!

863
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,170
Somebody help, please!

864
00:57:54,877 --> 00:57:57,647
(eerie spooky music)

865
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,749
(Q breathing heavily)

866
00:58:13,797 --> 00:58:15,027
So what?

867
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,064
So what happened?

868
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,099
What happened?

869
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:24,707
I grew up, is what happened.

870
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,578
You didn't have to become this.

871
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,613
I didn't have no choice.

872
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:31,373
You knew my dad
was counting on me.

873
00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:36,620
I was counting on you.

874
00:58:39,658 --> 00:58:41,592
(chess piece clanks)

875
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:53,703
(keys rattle)

876
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,398
(door creaks)

877
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,749
That's a dope mask.

878
00:59:08,687 --> 00:59:10,918
You know, I should have
just fucking killed your fat

879
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:12,755
board game head ass that day.

880
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,626
What's the matter stutter mouth,

881
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:17,485
cat go your tu, tu, tu.
- Shut up!

882
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,323
(intense spooky music)
(Boots grunts)

883
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:23,557
All right, got that
retarded strength, huh?

884
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:28,771
(Bitch Ass grunts)
(punches thud)

885
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:32,566
Get your bitch ass up.

886
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:35,602
(punches thud)

887
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:37,505
(table crashes)

888
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,814
Come on.

889
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:39,848
Q.

890
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:42,719
(footsteps stomp)

891
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,451
Yo, go this way.
I'm gonna go that way.

892
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:55,391
(punch thuds)
(men groaning)

893
01:00:08,747 --> 01:00:10,780
(Bitch Ass howls)

894
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:14,146
(Bitch Ass growls)

895
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:19,789
(somber music)

896
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,658
Cecil?

897
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:46,178
Oh my god, what
did they do to you?

898
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:51,150
(gun clicks)

899
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:52,184
Surprise.

900
01:00:54,188 --> 01:00:56,386
Damn, Bitch Ass Cecil.

901
01:00:57,356 --> 01:00:58,322
(punch thuds)
(Marsia screams)

902
01:00:58,357 --> 01:01:00,555
Where the fuck is my crew?

903
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:04,427
I'm not asking you again.
Where the fuck is my...

904
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:05,461
Spade.

905
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,563
Just let me talk to him.

906
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,906
Then hurry up and talk to him.

907
01:01:12,976 --> 01:01:14,206
Shit.

908
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:19,112
Please, my son
came here tonight.

909
01:01:19,147 --> 01:01:21,708
His name is Q.

910
01:01:21,743 --> 01:01:22,720
Where is he?

911
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:25,217
Is he still here?

912
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,551
Please, Cecil.

913
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:33,027
Look, man, enough of
this dumb shit, man.

914
01:01:33,062 --> 01:01:34,688
No!

915
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:36,393
I'm not gonna let you
do this to him again.

916
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:37,559
Wait you not gonna let me?

917
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,296
No.

918
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:39,495
You not gonna let me.

919
01:01:41,004 --> 01:01:43,037
You were just as guilty as I
was for what happened to him

920
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:45,534
back in the day
or did you forget?

921
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:48,944
(bells chiming)
(suspenseful music)

922
01:01:48,979 --> 01:01:50,704
I need your help.

923
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:51,782
What is it?

924
01:01:51,817 --> 01:01:53,707
I need you to get
Bitch Ass alone.

925
01:01:53,742 --> 01:01:55,709
Nah, nah man.

926
01:01:55,744 --> 01:01:57,953
Babe, listen, he,
he made look stupid.

927
01:01:57,988 --> 01:01:59,251
I can't just let that go.

928
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,418
Look, I'm not gonna hurt him.

929
01:02:01,453 --> 01:02:02,793
I just wanna scare him.

930
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:06,258
I love you.

931
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:08,326
Don't you love me?

932
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,296
Yeah.

933
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:12,902
Then will you do it?

934
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,904
You promise you're not
gonna hurt him, right?

935
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,136
I swear.

936
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:18,875
(eerie music)

937
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:38,521
(laughs) Shit, wait,
you didn't know, did you?

938
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:45,099
Yeah, you need to hear this.

939
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:48,102
Did you really think
it was a coincidence

940
01:02:48,137 --> 01:02:50,005
that you went down
the alley that day?

941
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:53,811
(cars whooshing)

942
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:58,574
Where are we?

943
01:02:59,247 --> 01:03:00,444
Oh, it's a shortcut.

944
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:01,643
Let's go that way.

945
01:03:01,678 --> 01:03:02,446
All right.

946
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:05,647
(suspenseful music)

947
01:03:15,164 --> 01:03:16,823
Think you forgot
this, Bitch Ass.

948
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:18,066
You thought you was
gonna get away with

949
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:19,826
making me look stupid.

950
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:22,664
I, I said, sorry.

951
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,303
Well, that ain't good enough.

952
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:25,403
And now you with my girl, again.

953
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:27,042
We weren't doing anything.

954
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:28,472
Funny, cause whenever I see you,

955
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:29,913
it look like you're
doing a lot of something.

956
01:03:29,948 --> 01:03:31,981
I just want to get outta here.

957
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,081
Yo, Boots, grab this nigga.

958
01:03:33,116 --> 01:03:34,841
Again, I'm tired
of this nigga, man.

959
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,018
(eerie music)

960
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,481
(feet rustling)
(punches thud)

961
01:03:37,516 --> 01:03:39,714
Spade, come on, don't.

962
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,862
No, don't, leave him alone.
That's enough.

963
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,162
No, please, don't do it.

964
01:03:48,197 --> 01:03:50,362
Don't, don't do that.

965
01:03:51,266 --> 01:03:52,100
Please.

966
01:03:52,135 --> 01:03:52,969
Do it.

967
01:03:54,302 --> 01:03:55,598
(Blade slashing)

968
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:57,072
Stop!

969
01:03:57,107 --> 01:03:58,634
Leave him alone.

970
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:01,505
[Man] Stop it, that's enough.

971
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,243
[Marsia] Stop! That's enough.

972
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:06,015
(car tires screeching)
(car horn honks)

973
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,842
Oh shit, it's his grandma.

974
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:11,548
(Marsia crying)

975
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:18,093
Babe, come on, we gotta go.

976
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:19,358
Yo, come on.

977
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,393
We gotta get outta here.
- I'm so sorry.

978
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:24,462
(Grandma wailing)

979
01:04:27,137 --> 01:04:29,302
(Bitch Ass grunting)

980
01:04:29,337 --> 01:04:31,799
Cecil, I'm so sorry.

981
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:32,800
You sorry to him?

982
01:04:34,276 --> 01:04:37,310
We're here looking for your
kid and you're sorry to him?

983
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:38,146
You sorry.
(intense eerie music)

984
01:04:38,181 --> 01:04:38,982
[Spade] Ahh!

985
01:04:39,017 --> 01:04:41,413
No, no Cecil.
Cecil.

986
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:43,811
(Marsia screams)

987
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,922
Stop!

988
01:04:47,157 --> 01:04:50,158
(Bitch Ass grunting)

989
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:51,929
I'm sorry.

990
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:58,529
(punch thuds)
(thud on the floor)

991
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,037
(bell gongs)

992
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:07,142
(suspenseful eerie music)

993
01:05:10,048 --> 01:05:12,609
(Marsia moans)

994
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:32,266
Spade.
(Spade whimpers)

995
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:35,137
Spade!
(Spade gasps)

996
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:36,765
You all right?
- What the fuck.

997
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,535
(table clatters)

998
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:39,042
Are you all right?

999
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:40,835
What kind of shit is this?

1000
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:51,153
What are you doing?

1001
01:05:52,981 --> 01:05:53,815
Cecil?

1002
01:05:56,193 --> 01:05:58,193
Let us the hell outta here, man.

1003
01:05:58,228 --> 01:05:59,656
Where's my son?

1004
01:06:01,396 --> 01:06:02,692
Where's Quentin?

1005
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,895
Your son is alive,

1006
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:10,502
for now.

1007
01:06:11,604 --> 01:06:13,241
We must play.

1008
01:06:13,276 --> 01:06:14,407
You know what fine?

1009
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,113
Cause after I beat
you, I swear to God.

1010
01:06:18,215 --> 01:06:19,511
I'm gonna kill your ass.

1011
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:23,515
The game is called Mayday.

1012
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,254
The objective of this game

1013
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:28,520
is to shoot down
the opponents plane.

1014
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:33,030
Marsia, you will tell
us if there's a hit

1015
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:35,758
or a miss.

1016
01:06:35,793 --> 01:06:39,234
You lie, your son dies.

1017
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,897
You mother fucker.

1018
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:45,768
Let's play.

1019
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:47,440
Promise you, I ain't gonna lose.

1020
01:06:47,475 --> 01:06:50,575
(cards clack)
(dice clatter)

1021
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,809
(suspenseful music)

1022
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,127
D four.

1023
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:10,562
Miss.

1024
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:12,894
Your turn.

1025
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:16,634
E three.

1026
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,242
Miss

1027
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:24,004
B four.

1028
01:07:30,452 --> 01:07:31,616
Hit.

1029
01:07:37,624 --> 01:07:38,821
Stab him.

1030
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:41,131
What?

1031
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:41,989
No.

1032
01:07:42,662 --> 01:07:44,827
Every hit gets a knife.

1033
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,765
It's either him, or Q.

1034
01:07:50,098 --> 01:07:51,273
You choose.

1035
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,067
[Spade] Marsia, don't do this.

1036
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:56,311
Don't listen to him.
He's fucking crazy.

1037
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,611
Marsia, you ain't
got to do this.

1038
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:03,318
(chair creaks)

1039
01:08:03,353 --> 01:08:04,981
Marsia, don't listen to him.

1040
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:08,851
Marsia.

1041
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,855
Don't do this, man.
- I'm sorry

1042
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,087
You don't even know if he got Q.

1043
01:08:14,122 --> 01:08:17,827
(Spade screams)
(tense eerie music)

1044
01:08:17,862 --> 01:08:18,696
Fuck!

1045
01:08:28,411 --> 01:08:29,872
Come on

1046
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:30,873
Come on!

1047
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:37,220
Help (moans) please.
(rope scraping)

1048
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,327
A six

1049
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:47,989
Miss.

1050
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:55,062
D four.

1051
01:08:58,408 --> 01:08:59,341
No.

1052
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:06,183
(heavy breathing) No Marsia.

1053
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:17,183
(Marsia screams)

1054
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:19,691
(Q grunting)

1055
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:31,736

1056
01:09:48,986 --> 01:09:49,985
C one

1057
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,691
Hit.

1058
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:54,396
Fucking finally.

1059
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:10,071
What the fuck.

1060
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,141
A two.

1061
01:10:16,948 --> 01:10:20,147
(suspenseful music)

1062
01:10:25,253 --> 01:10:26,087
No.

1063
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:34,436
Hit.

1064
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:40,904
There are no more spaces.

1065
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:44,314
(intense eerie music)

1066
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,449
Game

1067
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:49,484

1068
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:21,912
(eerie piano music)

1069
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:29,084
Spade

1070
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:33,891
You was right.

1071
01:11:38,601 --> 01:11:40,370
I should have just
left with you.

1072
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:44,264
It's okay.

1073
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,415
(intense eerie music)

1074
01:11:55,684 --> 01:11:57,486
What are you doing?
- It's okay.

1075
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,421
What is that?

1076
01:11:58,456 --> 01:11:59,653
[Bitch Ass] Mayday.
Mayday.

1077
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:00,489
- No please!
- Oh my god.

1078
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:02,359
You're going down.

1079
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:11,192
Spade

1080
01:12:19,642 --> 01:12:22,104
Who's the bitch ass now?

1081
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:26,339
Cecil, what the fuck, Cecil!

1082
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:27,450
Spade!

1083
01:12:28,882 --> 01:12:32,246
(Q breathing heavily)

1084
01:12:36,626 --> 01:12:37,889
Okay.

1085
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:39,891
[Marsia] No!

1086
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:42,355
(eerie music)

1087
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,466
Mom?

1088
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:47,228
(intense eerie music)

1089
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:54,576
I'm so sorry.

1090
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:56,611
Look at you.

1091
01:13:01,981 --> 01:13:03,981
I was a kid.

1092
01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:07,622
I made a bad decision.

1093
01:13:10,924 --> 01:13:13,529
I didn't know what they
were gonna do to you.

1094
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,602
(bell gongs)

1095
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:27,510
(Grandma groans)

1096
01:13:33,947 --> 01:13:35,342
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1097
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,685
Okay, I'm going to set you free.
- Thank you, help me.

1098
01:13:38,886 --> 01:13:40,523
My Cecil,

1099
01:13:40,558 --> 01:13:42,316
he's gone crazy.

1100
01:13:43,726 --> 01:13:45,561
I can't believe
you're still alive.

1101
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:50,159
He made it look like I was dead.

1102
01:13:50,194 --> 01:13:51,457
What?

1103
01:13:51,492 --> 01:13:53,470
Cause he knew you all
were trying to rob us.

1104
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:57,672
He tied me up. (whimpers)

1105
01:13:57,707 --> 01:13:59,707
He left me here.

1106
01:14:01,678 --> 01:14:03,337
I can't reason with him anymore.

1107
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,647
Please, okay, okay,
please, please, please

1108
01:14:05,682 --> 01:14:08,144
I need you to go save my mother.

1109
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:09,585
She's in your living room.

1110
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:14,315
Over there, by
the door, (gasping)

1111
01:14:16,022 --> 01:14:17,692
There's an old knife.

1112
01:14:19,487 --> 01:14:22,499
(suspenseful music)

1113
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:25,700
(gun clicks)

1114
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:34,907
Now, I told Cecil
y'all weren't right.

1115
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:35,743
(gun clicks)

1116
01:14:35,778 --> 01:14:36,744
Okay.

1117
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:42,178
You knew?

1118
01:14:45,183 --> 01:14:48,217
That boy means everything to me.

1119
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:52,529
And I'd do anything
to protect him.

1120
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:55,697
Mom!

1121
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:57,765
Mom!

1122
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,601
Q!

1123
01:14:58,636 --> 01:15:00,064
(eerie tech music)

1124
01:15:00,099 --> 01:15:02,429
(Grandma laughing)

1125
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,265
Mom!

1126
01:15:05,643 --> 01:15:07,544
[Marsia] No, Q!

1127
01:15:08,206 --> 01:15:09,535
Q!

1128
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,746
Ahh! My baby! (screams)

1129
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:14,749
(laughs) You want your mommy?

1130
01:15:14,784 --> 01:15:17,686
Cecil, let me go!
Cecil!

1131
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,116
Here she comes.

1132
01:15:20,086 --> 01:15:22,548
[Marsia] Where's my baby?

1133
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:26,288
[Q] Mom, mom are you okay?
Are you okay?

1134
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:30,765
Get them baby.
Kill them!

1135
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,427
Shut up, goddammit!

1136
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,639
(Grandma laughs)

1137
01:15:36,674 --> 01:15:38,102
Let it wait.

1138
01:15:41,338 --> 01:15:44,240
Let him play for his life!

1139
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:48,783
Choose your game.

1140
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,218
Rock, paper, scissors.

1141
01:15:55,253 --> 01:15:57,792
(suspenseful music)

1142
01:15:57,827 --> 01:16:00,421
(Bitch Ass laughs)

1143
01:16:13,711 --> 01:16:14,842
Come on Q.

1144
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:18,813
Best two outta three.

1145
01:16:20,883 --> 01:16:23,851
1, 2, 3, shoot.

1146
01:16:24,887 --> 01:16:25,820
Yes.

1147
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:37,634
(rock thuds)
(Bitch Ass screams)

1148
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:42,133
Do not lose this.

1149
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:50,438
Come on Q, baby come on.

1150
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:51,648
Okay, momma.

1151
01:16:56,919 --> 01:17:00,690
1, 2, 3, shoot.

1152
01:17:01,352 --> 01:17:02,483
No!

1153
01:17:04,762 --> 01:17:06,828
(Grandma laughing)

1154
01:17:06,863 --> 01:17:08,027
Wait.

1155
01:17:08,062 --> 01:17:09,325
Wait.

1156
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,832
Wait.
- Get him baby!

1157
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:11,833
Wait.

1158
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:13,802
(Q screams)

1159
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,673
(blood squelches)

1160
01:17:22,175 --> 01:17:24,681
(Grandma laughing)

1161
01:17:25,915 --> 01:17:27,376
Final round.

1162
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:29,686
To the death.

1163
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:32,414
Fine

1164
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:38,387
1, 2, 3 shoot.

1165
01:17:39,687 --> 01:17:41,225
No, no, no, no, no.

1166
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:44,624
Get him baby. (laughs)

1167
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,771
[Marsia] No, no, no, no, no.

1168
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:51,532
No, no.
(Q wailing in agony)

1169
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:54,238
(skin singeing)

1170
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,512
[Marsia] Stop!

1171
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:08,054
Put the lighter the
fuck down right now!

1172
01:18:08,089 --> 01:18:09,858
I will kill this
bitch, I swear to god.

1173
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,619
(Grandma gasping)

1174
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:13,389
Stop

1175
01:18:13,424 --> 01:18:15,556
No, you fucking stop!

1176
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:18,262
[Bitch Ass] No, grandma!
(tape ripping)

1177
01:18:18,297 --> 01:18:19,527
(intense eerie music)

1178
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:22,431
Grandma, grandma!
- Look here, you okay?

1179
01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:25,236
Grandma, grandma, grandma.

1180
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:27,876
(rock thudding)

1181
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:28,877
You mother fucker!

1182
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,209
You mother fucker, die!

1183
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:36,412
Mom! Mom!
(Marsia screaming)

1184
01:18:38,086 --> 01:18:40,823
Mom, please no.

1185
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:42,286
No.

1186
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:47,764
(heavy breathing)
- No baby, you go first.

1187
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:00,502
Yes.

1188
01:19:01,802 --> 01:19:02,339
Hey!

1189
01:19:02,374 --> 01:19:03,208
Mom!

1190
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:11,711
Oh, I thought you quit.

1191
01:19:16,784 --> 01:19:18,388
(music abruptly stops)
- I just did.

1192
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,621
(intense eerie music)

1193
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:22,491
Run, run!

1194
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,982
(bell gongs)

1195
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:45,987
(gentle music)

1196
01:19:54,063 --> 01:19:55,997
(door clicks)

1197
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:06,304
Hey.

1198
01:20:06,339 --> 01:20:07,338
Hey.

1199
01:20:09,078 --> 01:20:09,912
Well.

1200
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:12,508
Can't believe you're leaving.

1201
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:16,644
What am I gonna do without
my dishwasher? (laughs)

1202
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,921
Maybe get an actual dishwasher.

1203
01:20:18,956 --> 01:20:21,418
(laughing)

1204
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,025
You hungry baby?

1205
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,224
- Oh no. No, no, no.
- Want something to eat?

1206
01:20:25,259 --> 01:20:26,522
I'm not hungry.

1207
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:29,360
Not even some goodbye cake.

1208
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:30,867
Ma.

1209
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,904
Okay, okay.

1210
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:39,799
I know, I said I
wasn't gonna do this.

1211
01:20:42,243 --> 01:20:43,539
I'm just,

1212
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,443
I'm so proud of you.

1213
01:20:54,882 --> 01:20:56,420
I'm gonna miss you.

1214
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:02,525
Hey, can I come home
Friday for laundry?

1215
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,857
My house is not
your laundry mat.

1216
01:21:04,892 --> 01:21:06,793
(laughing)

1217
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:07,937
Okay.

1218
01:21:07,972 --> 01:21:09,906
Tell you what,
I'll play you for it.

1219
01:21:10,975 --> 01:21:11,908
Really?

1220
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,043
All right.

1221
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:16,407
You know what to do.

1222
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:20,081
You about to get
your ass kicked.

1223
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:23,777
1, 2, 3 shoot.

1224
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:29,420
Looks like I'm coming
home Friday with laundry.

1225
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:32,291
You know I let you
win again, right?

1226
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:35,789
(laughs) Yeah, whatever.

1227
01:21:36,594 --> 01:21:38,132
Okay.
All right.

1228
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:40,596
I'm out.

1229
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,863
- I'm proud of you.
- All right.

1230
01:21:44,536 --> 01:21:46,107
- Okay.
- All right.

1231
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:47,944
Bye.

1232
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:06,963
(Marsia sighs)

1233
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:23,474
(eerie suspenseful music)

1234
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:50,072
(static buzzing)

1235
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:52,965
(eerie piano music)

1236
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,177
(puzzle cube clicking)

1237
01:22:59,116 --> 01:23:03,217
Ah. (laughs)

1238
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:07,716
Fortune can change
in an instant.

1239
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:10,323
Roll of the dice.

1240
01:23:10,358 --> 01:23:12,589
The next card pull

1241
01:23:12,624 --> 01:23:16,230
can win you all.

1242
01:23:16,265 --> 01:23:19,167
Or cost you everything.

1243
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:24,271
And while our story is
now at it's conclusion,

1244
01:23:24,306 --> 01:23:27,835
Bitch Ass will play again.

1245
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:32,543
The question is which one
of you will he choose?

1246
01:23:33,117 --> 01:23:38,549
Which one of you will
be next? (laughs)

1247
01:23:39,288 --> 01:23:41,354
Till the next time. (laughs)

1248
01:23:41,389 --> 01:23:44,258
(eerie beat music)

1249
01:23:47,296 --> 01:23:50,627
(upbeat suspenseful music)
