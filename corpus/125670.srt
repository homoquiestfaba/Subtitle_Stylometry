- Glad you could come, Doctor.
- Hello.

357
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,309
Right this way.

00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,785
Constantly.

Oppenheimer used to say, "A genius

Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr. Parcher.

JOHN: I like to think it's because I'm a Ione wolf.

470
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:54,160
