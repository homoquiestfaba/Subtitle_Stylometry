1
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:44,149
BEWARE THE DOG KILLER

2
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,625
WHO ARE... JESUS AND THE BRIDES OF DRACULA?

3
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,625
Your rent is seriously overdue.
You have 5 days to pay or be evicted.

4
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,666
- Hey, mom.
- <i>Hi, honey. How are you?</i>

5
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:22,089
- I'm okay.
- <i>Good.</i>

6
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:27,000
- <i>Good. Are you at work?</i>
- Uh, yeah, it's kind of a busy day.

7
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:32,208
<i>Oh, I wanted to tell you this:
7th Heaven is playing on TCM tonight.</i>

8
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:38,375
- Mom, I don't have cable.
- <i>Aw, shoot, that's too bad.</i>

9
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,272
<i>It's a great Janet Gaynor movie from 1927.</i>

10
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:46,958
- She's one of your favorites, right?
- <i>Janet Gaynor? Yes!</i>

11
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,649
<i>Since I was a little girl, I've always admired her.</i>

12
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:54,763
- <i>She's so talented and beautiful...</i>
- Yeah. Well...

13
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,000
- I better get back to work.
- <i>Okay.</i>

14
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,416
- <i>I'm giving you a big hug over the phone.</i>
- Thanks.

15
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:04,274
- Love you.
- <i>I love you.</i>

16
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:05,808
- <i>Have a good week, honey.</i>
- Bye.

17
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:07,024
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

18
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,432
Come on, my little sweety pup.

19
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,434
It's swimming time.

20
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,863
<i>Hey!</i>

21
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,496
Hey, could you please turn your music down?

22
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,377
It's quiet as it gets.

23
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,177
Thanks, all right.

24
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,583
Come here, Coca Cola. Oh, we love this song, don't we?

25
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,418
Mmm, we love this song.

26
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,077
Fuck!

27
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:24,942
- Hey.
- Hi.

28
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,458
Good to see you, um...

29
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,877
- It's... for the role.
- Oh, cool.

30
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,911
- Uh, come in, come in.
- Oh, thanks.

31
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:38,591
So, weirdly, I had an audition around the corner,
and I thought you might wanna've lunch together.

32
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,563
You like sushi, right?

33
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,003
Yeah. Wow. Thanks.

34
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:45,670
Thanks.

35
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,212
What's that smell?

36
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,752
Well...

37
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,000
- There're a lot of skunks around here...
- Oh.

38
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,291
...in the woods by the golf course. So...

39
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,347
- always spraying. Can't do anything about it.
- Oh.

40
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,290
- I love your poster.
- Thanks.

41
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,988
I actually saw him perform in a concert,
believe it or not.

42
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,017
- Wow. Is it signed?
- Yeah. Recently and actually,

43
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,375
I know a girl who knows his daughter.
So I have his signature.

44
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,064
It's really cool.

45
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:39,659
<i>We're reporting live outside the Hollywood Estate
of Billionaire Mogul Jefferson Sevence.</i>

46
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:45,806
<i>Sevence has apparently gone missing after a
late night fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island.</i>

47
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,249
- <i>Witnesses claim...</i>
- Unbelievable.

48
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,212
<i>...they have seen him returning to the mainland,</i>

49
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:53,415
<i>and his car, a 1935 Duesenberg, has yet to be located.</i>

50
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,580
<i>Jeff, I love you.</i>

51
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:59,113
<i>Your family loves you.</i>

52
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,339
<i>- We love you, dad.
- We love you, daddy.</i>

53
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,550
Aw.

54
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,559
<i>I know we're gonna see you again soon.</i>

55
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:07,953
<i>I know you're alive. I can feel it.</i>

56
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,771
<i>We're offering a $ 2 million reward for any
information that helps us find my husband.</i>

57
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:15,633
<i>I beg you for your help.</i>

58
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,126
<i>Please, bring daddy home.</i>

59
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:33,776
What is that?

60
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,488
- It's the neighbors, they've a parrot.
- Oh.

61
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,258
- What's it saying?
- I'm not sure.

62
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,444
"Not a friend"?

63
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,332
Maybe.

64
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,923
- Hard to say.
- Hm.

65
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,368
My favorite issue.

66
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,174
Why this one?

67
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:11,714
Oh... I found it in my, uh...

68
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:16,829
in my dad's tool box when I was really young.

69
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,291
- Did you steal it?
- Hm-mm.

71
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,074
I, um...

72
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:26,147
The girl on the cover was the first I ever masturbated to.

73
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,278
Hm-mmm.

74
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,146
- She's pretty.
- I know, huh.

75
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,746
The first thing I ever masturbated to

76
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,154
was probably a rerun of Charles in Charge.

77
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,794
Oh, my god, that's awesome.

78
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,240
Yep, I'm pretty cool.

79
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,250
What are these?

80
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,375
Hey, no, don't. Oh...

81
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,684
No, don't. Don't. I'll wrap it up.

82
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,487
Okay.

83
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,812
Sorry. I, uh...

84
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,956
<i>Come on. Go on.</i>

85
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:07,444
<i>Good dog.</i>

86
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,231
"Rotterdam"?

87
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:13,893
I don't think so.

88
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:20,675
<i>Come on.</i>

89
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,228
What you're looking at?

90
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,700
That damn bird.

91
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:58,168
"Only I know the secrets of Silver Lake.

92
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:03,492
"In time I will reveal the truth behind the
mysterious crimes, murders and disappearances

93
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,000
"within this cursed community.

94
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,636
"I have the answers.

95
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,530
"I will reveal all...

96
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,418
under the Silver Lake."

97
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,630
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

98
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:17,253
You know who writes that?

99
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:19,583
Yeah, a local guy.

100
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,240
Strange, but nice.

101
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,480
Did he come in here ever?

102
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,708
Sure. I've seen him.

103
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,306
I give you, like, 5 bucks,
if you pass my number on to him.

104
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,483
I don't know.

105
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:34,264
Come on. I like his working.

106
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:35,773
I'd like to meet him.

107
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,365
You're just passing on a number, it's not...

108
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:43,541
Okay, sure, but I don't need your 5 dollars.

109
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,760
Hello.

110
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:25,953
Hey.

111
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:37,219
Hm, look at that, Coca Cola,
this nice man bought you a treat.

112
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,811
Will you say thank you?

113
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:43,808
- His name is Coca Cola?
- Yeah. Dependable as sunshine.

114
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,337
- Is that a coke's lady?
- Yeah.

115
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,001
An old one, I think.

116
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:53,074
My great-great-grandma used to say
that she was a pretty smart lady.

117
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,204
What kind of dog do you have?

118
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,392
Oh, um...

119
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,478
my dog died recently.

120
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,559
Oh.

121
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:05,118
I'm so sorry.

122
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:07,726
Thanks.

123
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,383
Well, it was nice meeting you.

124
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:11,863
Yeah.

125
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,103
- Yeah, I liked meeting you.
- Um...

126
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,604
Do you want to come in for a moment, have a drink?

127
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:32,456
What?

128
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,234
I saw you spying on me earlier.

129
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:39,535
No, I was not...

130
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,932
At the pool.

131
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,011
- Were you masturbating?
- No!

132
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:47,872
No.

133
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,924
- It's not that strange. I masturbate.
- Me too, but...

134
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,237
- Doesn't everyone?
- Yeah, but...

135
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,862
I was just looking.

136
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,890
Okay.

137
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,243
I believe you.

138
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,171
You wanna get stoned?

139
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:07,758
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

140
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:13,367
<i>I think this is it, kids.</i>

141
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,750
<i>A great big room full of nothing
but rich millionaires and us.</i>

142
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:33,166
That's pretty. What is that? Is there an engraving there?

143
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,711
- Yeah, from an old boyfriend.
- Mmm.

144
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:38,350
Old boyfriend?

145
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,358
- Hm-mm.
- Hm.

146
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,902
Do you like my tattoo?

147
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:51,174
- Is that real?
- No, just temporary. Came with a pack of gum.

148
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:52,736
Thank God, it's temporary.

149
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,916
<i>- You like that, monsieur?
- Comme ci, comme ça.</i>

150
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,333
<i>- That guy's really the end of the line.
- Still think he's kind of cute.</i>

151
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,507
<i>Who is he?</i>

152
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,844
I know you think it's gross.

153
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,510
Like, when I was sick in day school...

154
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:26,475
I ate my saltines and not my chicken noodles,

155
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:28,887
and with orange juice it was delicious.

156
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,468
It's like I've discovered an...

157
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,066
unknown combination...

158
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:39,770
that no one should die without trying.

159
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,469
<i>Sarah, were home...</i>

160
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,704
- and we brought somebody.
- Okay!

161
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,845
Don't you wanna go to a bar or anything?

162
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,224
I should probably call it a night.

163
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,317
Oh. Really?

164
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,542
Yeah.

165
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:23,130
I just want a drink.
I mean I don't wanna go home right now.

166
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:27,916
Um, not tonight. But, come over tomorrow.
Actually, we can lay here.

167
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:45,005
Look.

168
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,705
<i>What do you think?</i>

169
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,218
That's weird.

170
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:08,316
A little late in the summer to do fireworks, isn't it?

171
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:17,263
The leftovers, I guess.

172
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,757
Yeah.

173
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:23,512
Okay.

174
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,101
- Good night.
- Good night.

175
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:32,341
See you tomorrow?

176
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:33,921
Okay.

177
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,252
Better.

178
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,344
Fuck.

179
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:23,848
Fuck!

180
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,951
<i>That one's for you.</i>

181
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,240
<i>I write my name on this car.</i>

182
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,673
<i>I like this.</i>

183
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,366
<i>It is so hard, you could not erase.</i>

184
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,032
<i>Oh, man.</i>

185
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:51,923
Hey, come on, let's go!

186
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,229
What the hell, man?!

187
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,906
<i>Everyone in L.A. is wondering, where is Jefferson Sevence?</i>

188
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,666
<i>This man had literally been the face
of the city for decades,</i>

189
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,051
<i>with his charity work, his death defying daredevil antics,</i>

190
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,007
<i>his Hollywood production company,</i>

191
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:34,166
<i>the New York Eve's telecast, his public appearances
and award shows, the Rose Parade...</i>

192
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,125
<i>and that list just goes on and on.</i>

193
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:39,464
"Silver Lake and the east side of Los Angeles...

00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,954

00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,339
"Back then the area was known as Edendale.

00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:52,500
"In 1978 a Silverlake resident discovered a
can of film in his basement.

00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:57,003
"In the movie a young man holds a note
in front of the camera.

198
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:03,458
"It reads: 'No one will ever be happy here
until all the dogs are dead.'

"The man was an aspiring actor

201
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,446
"He was said to have been jealous of animals,

202

"specifically citing a deep contempt

203
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:27,531
"He resented the dog's success

"This author believes the suicide
of this obscure and failed actor

205

- Huh?!</i>

213
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,705
<i>You can take them to the dog home, are you, pa?</i>

214
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:12,084
They moved out.

215
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:14,406
How does that not make sense?

216
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,698
Who moves out in the middle of the night?

217
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,304
They wanted to leave.

218
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,144
They've forfeited their deposit, paid the lease,

219
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:24,157
they moved out. Nothing strange about it.

220
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:28,037
I don't understand why she didn't tell me.

221
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,291
I don't know. Maybe she didn't like you.

222
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:34,012
Maybe she knows your poor and haven't paid your rent.

223
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,966
Maybe she doesn't want to date a homeless man.

224
00:22:37,678 --> 00:22:40,071
Speaking of rent: This isn't personal,

225
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:45,867
but I want you to know you'll be forcibly removed
if you can't pay in the next 4 days.

226
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:48,903
Yeah, I couldn't even find her online.

227
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:50,843
Huh.

228
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:54,758
- That's weird, huh?
- I know.

229
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:58,235
- What you're gonna do?
- I'm not sure.

230
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,742
Have you heard about these dog killers?

231
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,751
Um... Are there more than one?

232
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:11,676
Who knows? It's just...

233
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,929
It's creepy.

234
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:21,321
I mean it's bad enough to get mugged,
but that someone stabs your dog...

235
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:25,833
- in front of your eyes, it's traumatizing.
- Yeah, totally, huh?

236
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:44,216
Ow.

237
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,541
LOST DOG

240
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,175
Fuck.

241
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,041
Welcome to purgatory.

242
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,911
Good to be here.

243
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,431
- Yeah, sometimes I think about things.
- Use it wisely.

244
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:13,458
All these holy trinities of women,
thriving like plants under the heat...

245
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:18,307
of the cities male gaze.
Three, three, three... three, three...

246
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:47,487
Jesus, we love you!

247
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,991
- Is Jesus still here, or did he leave already?
- I'm not sure.

248
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:19,144
- He's with one of the brides, I think.
- Romantically? - Probably.

249
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:22,534
He sure does seem to be making us
await for our hour with him.

250
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,987
- One bride at a time.
- He's a romantic.

251
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:29,117
You don't become a bride without fucking Jesus.

252
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:33,208
If he wasn't so handsome he'd never get around with it.

253
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:35,831
Blessed by the Holy Father, I guess.

254
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:49,750
Hey, do you know this girl?

255
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,188
Do you know where she is?

256
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Hey! Fuck you! Seriously!

257
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:11,200
Get the fuck out of here! It's the ladies room.

258
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,495
Piece of shit! Asshole!

259
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,416
Why we won't name ourselves
"Jesus and the brides of Frankenstein".

260
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:41,458
Because there is so much aphorism and pop-culture,
we were worried the whole thing might tire someone.

261
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:44,055
Yeah, I can see why you were worried.

262
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,583
- What you're doing here?
- Hey, Allen.

263
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,458
Nice to see you.

264
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:55,825
- Is that a woman's blouse?
- I guess so. - Guess?!

265
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,388
- What you're doing? Working?
- Yes, of course. How about you?

266
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:02,750
Yeah... working... thinking about things... a lot.
How does the world work?

267
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:06,122
Why we're swimming on roof tops
when there's an ocean right over there?

268
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,791
- Uh, I don't have the answers.
- Who does? Nobody does.

269
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:12,665
Hey, do you know a red-haired, a blonde and a brunette...

270
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:16,583
- that drive a white convertible rabbit?
- No, but I'm looking forward to meeting them.

271
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,794
I gonna see if I can track them down.

272
00:33:18,837 --> 00:33:22,583
- I like that dress. Hi.
- Hi. Thanks, Allen.

273
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,759
Oh, my god. Take a look.

274
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,046
- Isn't that Millicent Sevence?
- I think it is.

275
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:33,601
What is she doing here?
Isn't her dad kidnapped or something?

276
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:37,007
- It's not, like, a classy move.
- Well, hard to know, uh, hard to know

277
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,448
what a person might do when they're in pain.

278
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:43,403
I'm doing a secret solo show tomorrow at
Hollywood Forever. If you wanna come...

279
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,663
Yes. I'd love to.

280
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,966
This is your ticket.

281
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:53,492
Don't eat or break it. If it's missing anything,
even a crumb, they won't let you in.

282
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:54,546
Thank you.

283
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:56,799
I'm doing a secret solo show tomorrow...

284
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,312
- Oh, my god.
- What?

285
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:02,066
- Looks like they've found Millicent's dad.
- Hm? Really?

286
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,516
His body was burned or something.

287
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:08,137
He's dead?

288
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,294
Yeah.

289
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,147
Does she know?

290
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:09,598
Hello?

291
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,375
<i>Hi. One of the guys of the bookstore gave me your number.
You said you wanted to talk to me?</i>

292
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,413
Oh, sure. Yeah. Hi. Uh...

293
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,957
Yeah, I read your magazine and I wanted
to ask you some more questions about it.

294
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,606
Is there a good time for us to meet?

295
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,586
<i>Sure, of course. I'm actually writing all day tomorrow.
I'm finishing a new issue of "Under the Silver Lake".</i>

296
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,792
<i>But you're welcome to stop at the house.</i>

297
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:35,500
- Uh, well, can you text me your address?
- <i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

298
00:35:35,582 --> 00:35:37,928
Okay, great. I'll see you then.

299
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,142
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

300
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:58,565
Fuck.

301
00:36:33,808 --> 00:36:36,791
<i>We're looking at the footage
of the crime scene discovered earlier tonight.</i>

302
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:42,567
<i>The burning car, a 1935 Duesenberg, was spotted
by a resident who immediately called the authorities.</i>

303
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:48,373
<i>Now, it's hard to believe that the L.A. police chief has
confirmed that the remains are those of Jefferson Sevence.</i>

304
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:52,166
<i>As reported earlier, Sevence was found dead in his car</i>

305
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:55,353
<i>with the bodies of three women, believed to be prostitutes.</i>

306
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,736
<i>In addition, some unnamed sources have leaked
a very odd detail about the case.</i>

307
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:01,729
<i>Apparently the remains of a dog,</i>

308
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:03,693
<i>a breed known as Bichon Frise,</i>

309
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:06,429
<i>were found in the purse of one of the victims.</i>

310
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,376
<i>This has officially become a very grizzling
and puzzling murder investigation.</i>

311
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:11,516
<i>I'm joined now by...</i>

312
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:28,115
Fuck.

313
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,247
Who is the Owl's Kiss?

314
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:34,220
<i>The Owl's Kiss is a lost legend of folklore.</i>

315
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:38,311
<i>Just as terrifying as the Wolfman
or Frankenstein's Monster.</i>

316
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,541
<i>She is a woman who arrives in the night,
through windows and locked doors,</i>

317
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:48,125
<i>naked except for her mask of taxidermied owl skin.</i>

318
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,166
<i>She seduces men and women alike,
killing them in their sleep.</i>

319
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:57,625
<i>This beautiful spectre is responsible for
dozens of deaths within the Los Angeles basin,</i>

320
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,583
<i>though she has yet to be mentioned by mainstream media.</i>

321
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:03,000
<i>Theories abound as to her motives.</i>

322
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:09,333
<i>This author believes she may be a member of a longstanding
American cult with origins in trade and finance.</i>

323
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:14,208
<i>It's the unlucky soul who finds himself
the recipient of an owl's kiss.</i>

324
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,636
What a bunch of bullshit.

325
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,060
I can't believe Jefferson Sevence is dead.

326
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,176
It looks like every year more and more celebrities
decease. People I grew up with just die.

327
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:39,117
Dick Clark, Elizabeth Taylor, Johnny Carson...

328
00:38:39,204 --> 00:38:40,708
Everybody dies.

329
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:44,717
Even those people that you think would be here forever.

330
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,173
What were those pages on your nightstand?

331
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:51,497
- The ones with the scribbles on it.
- Aw, it was nothing.

332
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,252
Come on, tell me, I wanna know.

333
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:56,365
Well, have you ever heard about, um, old

334
00:38:56,932 --> 00:39:01,582
record albums having satanic messages on 'em
if you play them backwards?

335
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:02,928
Sure.

336
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:08,084
Well, I was watching Wheel of Fortune,
and I noticed that Vanna White did this...

337
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:13,833
a little pattern of glance that I saw of her.

338
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:20,500
She looked straight ahead, to the right,
to the left, and then back again.

339
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:28,039
I was wondering: Is that random?
Is there a reason, like a pattern behind it?

340
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,757
And if there is, maybe there's something new
in that pattern, so...

341
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:33,795
I started taking notes while it happened.

342
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,888
Passed seven month that I keep record.

343
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,728
I've just be thinking:

344
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:45,578
Why do we just assume that all this

345
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:52,038
infrastructure and entertainment
and open information and this beaming

346
00:39:52,545 --> 00:39:58,091
all over the place, all the time,
and every single home on the planet

347
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:01,404
is exactly what we're told it is?

348
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:06,353
Maybe there're people out there who are more important
than us, more powerful and wealthier than us,

349
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:11,069
that are communicating things and seeing things in the
world that are meant only for them, and not for us?

350
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:17,318
I think it's fucking ridiculous to assume
that media has just purpose, right?

351
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:20,718
Hm, yeah.

352
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:23,344
Oh, you think that's weird.

353
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,977
- A little.
- Okay.

354
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:29,888
Don't you ever think that maybe rich people
know something that you and I don't?

355
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,546
A good restaurant... maybe.

356
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:40,570
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but you smell so bad...

357
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:43,458
- Yeah.
- ...and I... I think I should get going.

358
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:48,833
- Don't you want thanks for the juice?
- I'll be back when the smell goes away.

359
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:54,000
<i>Now Vanna White. Vanna is from Atlanta,</i>

360
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,672
<i>and she is...</i>

361
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:59,052
<i>a professional model.</i>

362
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:15,708
Come on in! The water is still refreshing.

363
00:43:13,002 --> 00:43:16,002
MOVIE AUDITIONS

364
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:18,362
- Christ!
- Ough!

365
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:24,856
- It's truly creepy, huh?
- Yeah.

366
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,296
I don't even walk my dog anymore.

367
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:29,243
- We use a litter box.
- Hell.

368
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,756
What's that smell?

369
00:43:32,262 --> 00:43:33,882
Oh! I don't know.

370
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:37,969
- I smell it, too.
- Oh, god! Aw!

371
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,023
Fuck!

372
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:43,629
Hey, that's my car!

373
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:46,258
- Hey, don't! You can't take my car! Please!
- It's my job, man.

374
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:48,785
You can't keep it if you can't make the payments.

375
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,958
I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW

376
00:44:32,064 --> 00:44:33,145
- Hey.
- Hey.

377
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:34,524
Come on in.

378
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:37,184
- Thanks.
- You want a beer?

379
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:40,166
- Yeah, please.
- Hot day and a cold beer.

380
00:45:03,348 --> 00:45:04,741
What are these masks?

381
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:08,908
They're life masks.

382
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:12,717
What's a life mask?

383
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:18,854
Um, it's a resin casting of famous people's faces.

384
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:24,750
Th... They're all real, and truly life
representations of these amazing people.

385
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:34,287
Most of them are from film productions, some were cast
by a sculpture or statue construction, like, um, Lincoln's.

386
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:37,048
That's his real face?

387
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:39,892
And this is, um...

388
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:42,372
Johnny Depp next to...

389
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:43,952
Grace Kelly.

390
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,251
Hm.

391
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,792
I really need to get a family.

392
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,344
So that I have somebody to leave this to, right?

393
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:55,386
These people, they...

394
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:58,406
they need to be remembered.

395
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:05,441
Stay quiet.

396
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:08,764
- What?
- It means "stay quiet".

397
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,298
It's, uh, a hobo-code.

398
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:12,745
- Really?
- Yeah.

399
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,359
Hobos and rail riders used it a lot in the 1930's.

400
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:19,386
Here.

401
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,169
Take a look.

402
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:26,410
They used it to let people know who was cool, who wasn't...

403
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,573
what houses offered food, if there was a doctor in town
that might be sympathetic to travelers. That sort of thing.

404
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,854
Okay. So why is it in Sarah's room?

405
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:36,338
And...

406
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:40,231
- who they're telling to be quiet?
- I don't know.

407
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:42,477
Maybe you.

408
00:46:45,566 --> 00:46:47,893
There's been this rash of

409
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,607
lost and found signs

410
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:51,053
for dogs,

411
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,253
humans,

412
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,027
musical instruments...

413
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,887
All over the past 2 years.

414
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:58,399
Something really big is going on.

415
00:46:58,533 --> 00:46:59,546
I know it.

416
00:46:59,806 --> 00:47:03,406
- And you think any of this could be connected to Sarah?
- Of course.

417
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,783
It could be a lot of things. Um...

418
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:08,556
sex and drug trafficking, the cult of whale,

419
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,992
the dog killer... I don't know.

420
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,266
Lately, I just assume that

421
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:15,791
the Owl's Kiss has something to do with everything.

422
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:20,130
Mmm, I'm not so sure about that.

423
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,411
Do you have a dollar bill on you?

424
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,855
I might.

425
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:45,114
Here.

426
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:47,007
Take a look.

427
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,780
That's the sign from the Owl's Kiss. Right there,

428
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,913
on every dollar bill in this country.

429
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,007
With every transaction we're interact by her law.

430
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:00,216
Any household that eats, lives or trades under
her eyes is subject to her jurisdiction.

431
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:02,932
Our world is filled with codes, pacts,

432
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:05,473
user agreements, subliminal messages...

433
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,764
Here.

434
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:17,154
Here. Here.

435
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:22,529
Words and symbols, hidden in printed advertising,
sexual innuendo connected to corporations.

436
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:47,893
Ideologies used when we're adapted to free will,
but are actually a result of hidden messages.

437
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:51,112
Okay. So if there're messages that aren't subliminal

438
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:54,791
but that are meant only for certain people?

439
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:55,931
Of course.

440
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,258
That's as common as tits and hamburgers.

441
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:12,471
- What's with all the cameras?
- I'm trying to protect myself.

442
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,511
Do you know how many people have died from the Owl's Kiss?

443
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,910
No, I don't.

444
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:19,462
I got the place all wired up.

445
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:22,043
Nobody gets in here without me knowing, right?

446
00:49:33,396 --> 00:49:35,776
Here it is. Here it is.

447
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:38,780
I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it.

448
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:42,382
I bought this from another collector 5 years ago.

449
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:48,220
I'm convinced that map

450
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,340
is the key to everything I've been searching for
my whole life.

451
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:54,361
Seriously?

452
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:55,928
Seriously.

453
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,621
Well, I think all you have to do

454
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:01,821
is mark now where the characters are hiding

455
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:04,573
and then send them this contest card right here.

456
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,516
No, it's not about this piece of toy.
It's the map. It's geographically the scale

457
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,830
from Silver Lake to the Hollywood Hills.

458
00:50:11,316 --> 00:50:14,356
It is guiding me somewhere important.

459
00:50:14,555 --> 00:50:17,316
And one of these days I will crack it.

460
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:28,051
<i>Hey, man.</i>

461
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:30,214
<i>Where is your car?</i>

462
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:33,614
Oh, it's in the shop.

463
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,821
It'll be painted over all the graffiti.

464
00:50:36,137 --> 00:50:37,150
I told you.

465
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,590
That's what you get for driving a cart model.

466
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,150
I like my car.

467
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:45,810
And I like my cock, but I don't have to compensate for it.

468
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,327
- Where the hell do you get something like that?
- You can get everything. Amazon.

469
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:58,782
Check it out, man.

470
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,756
Silver Lake from above.

471
00:51:15,715 --> 00:51:16,768
How is it going?

472
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:19,781
I'm, like, scaring out these houses.

473
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,584
I think to god this chick used to be, like, a lingerie
model or something. Insane body.

474
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:31,116
I mean, you know, you gotta be patient.

475
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:38,102
Dude, I feel like you've fucked up some very long time ago

476
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:43,726
and that you lead a wrong life, like a bad version of

477
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:48,045
- the life you was supposed to have.
- Come on, that wouldn't be fine.

478
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:52,638
I used to think that I was gonna be someone that, like...

479
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,279
that people cared about.

480
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,518
Like, maybe do something...

481
00:51:57,912 --> 00:51:58,958
really important.

482
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:00,572
God, man.

483
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,142
Everyone thinks that.

484
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,822
That's narcissism and entitlement one on one.

485
00:52:06,948 --> 00:52:09,134
I feel like somebody is following me.

486
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,304
Yeah, probably.

487
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:15,161
Let's say, who's not being followed these days?

488
00:52:15,211 --> 00:52:21,037
What I meant, I'm getting that a lot lately,
like, hm, even before all this craziness.

489
00:52:24,732 --> 00:52:27,093
That's the modern persecution complex.

490
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:33,096
Who needs witches and werewolves anymore, right?
Now we have... computers.

491
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,979
I swear to god, if they're released

492
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:39,656
the entire population is suffering from mild paranoia.

493
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,245
See, our little monkey brains,

494
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:46,209
they're comfortable knowing that we're all interlinked
and routed together now in some kind of

495
00:52:46,252 --> 00:52:48,522
all-knowing alien mind hive.

496
00:52:48,571 --> 00:52:52,291
And that shit is, as a straight-up says,
a pit for delusion, for fear...

497
00:52:52,365 --> 00:52:53,405
Oh!

498
00:52:58,652 --> 00:53:00,101
Looks like somebody's home.

499
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,455
♪ Come with me ♪

500
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:08,852
♪ And you'll be ♪

501
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:13,352
- ♪ In a world of pure imagination ♪
- You're sick.

502
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:08,052
- I'm gonna take off. See you soon.
- Yeah, be careful out there, buddy.

503
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,777
<i>I think it would've gone further, but here mom came home.</i>

504
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,331
<i>She realized that I had a boy in the living room,</i>

505
00:54:17,374 --> 00:54:20,684
<i>so she actually closed the doors to the den
to give us some privacy.</i>

506
00:54:21,255 --> 00:54:23,222
<i>Then did anything happen?</i>

507
00:54:23,562 --> 00:54:27,727
<i>I finally gave up, and we just watched cartoons.</i>

508
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:36,939
<i>Can I have one?</i>

509
00:54:37,847 --> 00:54:39,059
<i>No.</i>

510
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:44,518
I say dumb her.

511
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:47,938
- You're just a dumb rat.
- Can we just shut up and try to watch the movie?

512
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:50,327
Yeah, I want to see my close-up.

513
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:54,114
Wow, there it is. I'm impressed!

514
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:58,274
<i>I have never seen such a big forehead.</i>

515
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:01,556
<i>All right, one cigarette. Then you got to go.</i>

516
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:08,144
<i>It looks like 20 meters high.</i>

517
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:10,465
- Shhh.
- Film stars.

518
00:55:12,848 --> 00:55:15,821
- Yes.
- Yeah, on the big screen and boom.

519
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:20,261
Hey, are you the girls in the movie?

520
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,708
- Yeah. Yeah, that's us.
- Oh.

521
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:25,015
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

522
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:29,844
- Do you like the movie?
- Um, I just got here, so I...

523
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:32,746
But it seems like a nice movie.

524
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:34,981
Do you smell that?

525
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:39,837
- Smells like skunk.
- And pot.

526
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,880
There're a lot of skunks in Los Angeles.

527
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,800
Especially on the east side.

528
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:49,035
- We have to go. Let's go.
- Nice to meet you.

529
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:51,977
- Go. Go.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.

530
00:55:52,795 --> 00:55:56,388
- Easy, easy.
- I'll get that ass. You know I'll get that ass. Come here!

531
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:21,880
You've to take a bite before I can let you in.

Record.

550
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:53,741
- Hi!
- <i>Record.</i>

551
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:58,034
- How you're doing?
- Work is good. I'm just floating on.

552
00:57:58,089 --> 00:58:01,219
Hm. Yeah, I get it. Jack and Coke, please.

553
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,591
Hey, did you find those girls you're looking for?

554
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:07,050
- Uh, no. Not yet.
- Hm-mm. I'll keep an eye on it.

555
00:58:07,137 --> 00:58:09,577
- Three hot girls in a Rabbit.
- Yeah.

556
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:16,772
Hey, have you noticed anything... like, um...
strange happening with this group of friends?

557
00:58:16,815 --> 00:58:20,375
- Well, that's... that's kind of a everyday scene, right?
- Something out of the ordinary?

558
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:24,798
Right, yeah, but I'm just... I mean...
I guess I mean, like extra strange.

559
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:28,181
- Last week I hooked up with this chick. She was...
- Thank you.

560
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:33,019
...fucked up out of her mind. But she said
some weird stuff about Jesus and the Brides.

561
00:58:33,062 --> 00:58:34,075
Like what?

562
00:58:34,289 --> 00:58:36,849
That there's a message in the music.

563
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:41,991
A secret message?

564
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:43,531
Hm-mm.

565
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:47,977
- So what does it say?
- I've no clue, dude.

566
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:51,017
- Who's the girl?
- She's one of the many.

567
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,220
- All right.
- Crazy makes for good sex. Remember that.

568
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:28,376
I liked your dance last night. It was great.

569
00:59:29,142 --> 00:59:30,688
- You saw me?
- Uh-hum.

570
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:33,909
Would you buy me one?

571
00:59:36,437 --> 00:59:39,379
Uh-hum. Can I get one more, please?

572
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:40,595
- Sure.
- Thank you.

573
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:43,582
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Um...

574
00:59:44,675 --> 00:59:46,508
Hey, can I ask you a...

575
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:48,795
question...

576
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:50,662
Yes.

577
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,170
Um... Have you ever seen her around?

578
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:57,249
That's Sarah.

579
00:59:57,529 --> 00:59:59,269
Yeah. You know what happened to her?

580
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:08,181
Come with me.

581
01:00:09,185 --> 01:00:11,574
- Come on.
- Where are we going? - To the basement.

582
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:14,724
<i>Record.</i>

583
01:00:20,425 --> 01:00:21,425
Come on.

584
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:24,012
It's old music night in the Crypt Club.

585
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:39,358
I don't know her very well, but she was around.

586
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:42,185
Soirees, parties, and shows and stuff.

587
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:46,894
I don't know what happened to her, but I can tell you
that it nothing to do with my friends.

588
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:50,057
We're just enjoying our world.

589
01:00:50,683 --> 01:00:53,924
Enjoying our bodies, enjoying our music.

590
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:58,681
I heard there's some type of code, like, secret message

591
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:00,242
in their music.

592
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:03,615
I'm pretty sure that's not true.

593
01:01:04,195 --> 01:01:06,448
Jesus wouldn't hide a message in a message.

594
01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:09,222
There is nothing to solve, you know.

595
01:01:10,175 --> 01:01:13,688
It's silly wasting your energy
on something that doesn't matter.

596
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:27,264
We have this tiny little window

597
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,547
where we can have fun,

598
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,524
fuck,

599
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,284
be free.

600
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,663
Life is too short, right?

601
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,224
I wanna dance to this.

602
01:01:43,675 --> 01:01:45,656
- Come on.
- I don't know this song.

603
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,296
Come on!

604
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:40,289
We should fuck!

605
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:43,009
Yeah!

606
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:50,436
What? What's wrong? What's wrong?

607
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,674
I'm... I'm feeling really strange.

608
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:01,067
Jesus.

609
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,707
How much of that cookie did you eat?

610
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:06,835
All of it.

611
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:09,514
Shit. Oh, fuck.

612
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:10,841
Sorry.

613
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:34,406
Fuck.

614
01:03:50,313 --> 01:03:51,333
Hey.

615
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,919
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait!

616
01:03:57,044 --> 01:03:59,164
Hey! Hey.

617
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:01,650
Wait!

618
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:03,570
Wait!

619
01:04:04,504 --> 01:04:05,510
Wait!

620
01:04:05,697 --> 01:04:06,744
Hey!

621
01:04:40,246 --> 01:04:41,446
Hi, mom.

622
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:44,207
<i>Hello! I'm so glad you picked up.</i>

623
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,926
<i>I have good news.</i>

624
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,287
<i>Remember I told you about that Janet Gaynor movie?</i>

625
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:50,686
Uh-hum.

626
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:55,196
<i>Well, I taped it for you,
and I'm gonna send it in the mail,</i>

627
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:57,846
<i>but I wanted to make sure you had a VCR.</i>

628
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:01,004
Oh, yeah.

629
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:06,148
I... got a machine. It's just not hooked up.

630
01:05:06,191 --> 01:05:08,056
But if you send me the tape, I can watch it.

631
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,180
<i>Oh, good!</i>

632
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:12,440
<i>I just thought it would be something nice to share.</i>

633
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:14,849
<i>She's so lovely.</i>

634
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:18,510
<i>I... I feel connected to here. Is that silly?</i>

635
01:05:18,555 --> 01:05:20,790
No, mom, it's not silly.

636
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:22,968
<i>Well...</i>

637
01:05:23,034 --> 01:05:27,208
<i>I won't keep you. I know how busy you are. But I love you.</i>

638
01:05:28,206 --> 01:05:29,432
Love you.

639
01:05:30,014 --> 01:05:31,627
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

640
01:05:51,775 --> 01:05:54,095
I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW

641
01:06:00,563 --> 01:06:06,573
Hey, man, do you really you gonna find
a hidden message in a pop song?

642
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:07,622
I don't know.

643
01:06:07,665 --> 01:06:10,755
I just remember being in my room when I was, like, ten,

644
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:15,954
and created all this weird little codes
and secret languages.

645
01:06:15,997 --> 01:06:20,980
This entire generation of men is obsessed
with video games, secret codes...

646
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,144
- Yeah.
- ...space aliens...

647
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,250
Fuck!

648
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:30,042
It used to be a hundred years ago...

649
01:06:31,095 --> 01:06:34,625
you know, any moron could wander through the woods and

650
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:39,158
look behind a rock or some shit
and discover some cool new thing.

651
01:06:39,201 --> 01:06:40,535
Not anymore.

652
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,298
Where's the mystery that make everything worthwhile?

653
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,810
We crave mysteries, because there's none left.

654
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:15,222
YOU, ALL ALONE, YOU AND I, THE TWO OF US,
TURNING LIKE TEETH, SIGH, OH, DEAR

655
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,461
Fuck.

656
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:04,941
Okay.

657
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:20,369
JEFFERSON SEVENCE DEAD. WHY IS HE GONE?

658
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:49,269
ENJOY THE COMPANY OF HOLLYWOOD'S
UP AND CUMMING INGENIOUS! TONIGHT.

659
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:57,295
CALL NOW!

660
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:17,701
Hey, it's you.

661
01:09:19,052 --> 01:09:20,059
Hey.

662
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:22,839
What do you do?

663
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:25,412
Nothing.

664
01:09:26,592 --> 01:09:27,765
I meant your work.

665
01:09:27,808 --> 01:09:29,848
Oh, god. All I'm ever hearing is:

666
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:36,256
What do I do for work? Do you have work?
Where you work? Working good? Working hard?

667
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:40,165
- People have to work.
- What about you? You're in a movie. Why you're...

668
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:41,372
doing this?

669
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:46,003
It was only one movie and... I didn't earn a penny.

670
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:49,509
- Do you know how expensive it is here?
- Yeah, I do.

671
01:09:51,015 --> 01:09:56,668
Do you want a blow-job from the supporting actress
Academy Award nominee from last year?

672
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,420
Call Shooting Star.

673
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:08,992
Or do you want to do it with girlfriend
of the lead in the biggest sitcom?

674
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:11,765
Call Shooting Star.

675
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:16,458
You wanna fuck an It-Girl? It's not that hard.

676
01:10:20,206 --> 01:10:24,940
You are a patron for the arts and I can pay my bill.

677
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:30,486
- You pay me with credit card, right?
- Uh...

678
01:10:36,246 --> 01:10:39,138
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

679
01:10:42,586 --> 01:10:43,974
I was wondering...

680
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:49,359
last night at the cemetery, who was
that paranoid looking guy in the limo?

681
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,213
No idea.

682
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:54,280
You don't know his name?

683
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,027
No, he's anonymous.

684
01:10:59,077 --> 01:11:00,840
You don't know anything about him?

685
01:11:04,187 --> 01:11:05,200
Okay.

686
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,390
Do you have anything to eat?

687
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:22,895
I know this girl.

688
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:26,922
- Really?
- Uh-hum.

689
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:30,462
- How'd you know her?
- Sex, a party a few years ago.

690
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:32,422
- Oh, yeah?
- Hm-mm.

691
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,515
- Did you talk to her?
- No, that was not possible.

692
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:43,227
- Why?
- Um...

693
01:11:43,827 --> 01:11:45,874
She was on this glass cube

694
01:11:46,353 --> 01:11:51,486
in the middle of the living room.
It was like some pop performance, I guess.

695
01:11:52,426 --> 01:11:57,352
And she was just sitting there
wearing a dalmatian fur bathing suit,

696
01:11:57,773 --> 01:12:00,493
not moving nor making eye contact.

697
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:04,873
All these drunk old men were tapping on the glass,

698
01:12:05,725 --> 01:12:06,825
but she didn't move.

699
01:12:10,207 --> 01:12:11,260
Who took you there?

700
01:12:12,685 --> 01:12:17,560
Some nasty producer.
He brought me and some girls as dates.

701
01:12:18,765 --> 01:12:19,818
What is his name?

702
01:12:20,852 --> 01:12:21,865
I don't remember.

703
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:27,991
He makes these big action films
based on household cleaning products.

704
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,691
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

705
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:36,599
Yeah. So, we get there,

706
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:38,730
we get through the gate,

707
01:12:39,797 --> 01:12:41,824
they check our IDs,

708
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:43,863
and...

709
01:12:44,677 --> 01:12:48,077
then we're just free to go wherever we want
in that luxury neighborhood.

710
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,264
We just can go in any house we want, any room we want.

711
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:54,876
There's food everywhere, and music,

712
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:57,476
dancing, craziness...

713
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:02,316
Just a big open party like than ones that Gatsby gave.

714
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:08,749
- So, who's place was it?
- Nobody really said. That was weird.

715
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,150
But...

716
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,591
there's this one house,

717
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:18,474
the biggest house of the block, this big stone mansion.

718
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:22,900
And we were not allowed to go there.
It was the only place off limits.

719
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:28,013
I heard some girls in the bathroom talking about

720
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:31,072
how it belonged to some songwriter.

721
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:34,212
Must've been a famous song.

722
01:13:34,559 --> 01:13:35,946
Hm, no shit.

723
01:14:10,169 --> 01:14:11,209
Okay.

724
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:14,629

725
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:18,232

01:14:24,684 --> 01:14:26,481

"Rub Deans head and wait under Newton."

756
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:13,532
Okay. "Rub Deans head and wait under Newton."
What the fuck does that mean?

757
01:16:13,592 --> 01:16:19,039
Dean Martin, Harry Dean Stanton,
Dean Koontz, Richard Dean Anderson,

758
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:23,857
Dean of Admissions, Dean Stockwell, James Dean.

759
01:16:23,923 --> 01:16:25,650
Rub Deans head... Rub Deans head...

760
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:44,714

01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:46,187
Huh!

762
01:17:00,086 --> 01:17:01,629
Rub Deans head.

763
01:17:14,113 --> 01:17:15,199

01:17:16,912 --> 01:17:18,152
Galileo.

765
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,903
Kepler.

766
01:17:21,157 --> 01:17:22,257
Where are you?

767
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:28,813
Newton. Okay. Rub Deans head and wait under Newton.

768
01:17:29,947 --> 01:17:30,947
Okay.

769
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:05,547
I saw you...

770
01:18:07,134 --> 01:18:08,927
rubbing the statue's head.

771
01:18:11,498 --> 01:18:12,504
Uh-huh.

772
01:18:13,826 --> 01:18:16,517
Here. Put that over your eyes.

773
01:18:16,904 --> 01:18:18,610

I'm a homeless king.

Really?

777
01:18:31,598 --> 01:18:32,605
Yes.

778
01:18:33,971 --> 01:18:35,131
Where we're going?

779
01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:38,964
Just concentrate on walking, okay?

780
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:43,352
Some people don't realize the smell about themselves,

781
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:46,339
but you...

782
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,704

Is that a dog?

786
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:02,698
It's a coyote.

787
01:19:02,986 --> 01:19:04,479
But it won't gonna bite me, right?

788
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:06,071
No.

789
01:19:06,419 --> 01:19:09,794
Coyotes are... blessed creatures.

790
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:13,844
If you ever find yourself alone with a coyote,

791
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:16,644
you don't run away.

792
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:21,651
You follow it, see where it takes you.

793
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:28,747
People say that we own land.

794
01:19:29,468 --> 01:19:30,734
The streets,

795
01:19:31,353 --> 01:19:33,139
the gardens, the hills,

796
01:19:34,897 --> 01:19:37,039
the houses and the caves...

797
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:42,143
everything belongs to the coyotes.

798
01:19:43,782 --> 01:19:45,742
They just let us use it.

799
01:19:55,498 --> 01:19:56,632
Where are we?

800
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:00,689
You know I can't tell you that.

801
01:20:01,849 --> 01:20:03,322
Sure. Of course.

802
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:05,316
Okay, though.

803
01:20:05,876 --> 01:20:07,009
This way?

804
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:15,230
Fuck.

805
01:21:37,438 --> 01:21:39,618
It's a fucking bomb shelter.

806
01:22:13,336 --> 01:22:17,410
<i>Dear customers, the discounted cleaning products
are located in aisle 2.</i>

807
01:22:23,983 --> 01:22:27,336
<i>I need the price of 5 hamburgers, ma'am.</i>

808
01:22:32,933 --> 01:22:34,758
- Can I help you?
- What's going on?

809
01:22:35,598 --> 01:22:37,031
You're a friend with the family?

810
01:22:37,311 --> 01:22:40,031
I just know him, but not very well.

811
01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:42,388
The neighbor found him.

812
01:22:43,048 --> 01:22:44,408
Committed suicide.

813
01:22:45,855 --> 01:22:46,875
God.

814
01:22:49,594 --> 01:22:51,367
He didn't seem suicidal.

815
01:22:51,573 --> 01:22:54,619
Yeah. I spent two hours in the man's house.

816
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,573
There's something's wrong about him.

817
01:23:55,521 --> 01:23:56,534
Okay.

818
01:24:10,493 --> 01:24:13,576
TREASURE HUNT!

819
01:24:22,798 --> 01:24:23,825
Okay.

820
01:25:00,753 --> 01:25:01,800
Oh, fuck.

821
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:18,820
Oh, fuck!

822
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:36,326
- Allen.
- <i>Hey, sir, how are you?</i>

823
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:38,622
Hey. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

824
01:25:38,665 --> 01:25:42,718
Um, I were wondering if you might know
how I can get in touch with Jesus?

825
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:45,761
- <i>I'm the wrong guy to ask.</i>
- All right. I mean the lead singer in the band.

826
01:25:45,804 --> 01:25:47,326
<i>Yeah, I'm fucking with you, man.</i>

827
01:25:47,369 --> 01:25:49,802
- <i>What are you doing right now?</i>
- Walking home.

828
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:51,451
- <i>Can you play chess?</i>
- Not really.

829
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:53,587
That'll work. I'll be at your place in ten minutes.

830
01:25:54,807 --> 01:25:59,743
This is an cable TV actor who likes to have people around,
so he throws these chess parties

831
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:01,940
with hot chicks and guys who like to play chess.

832
01:26:06,993 --> 01:26:10,289
Hm, that is... a terrible move.

833
01:27:26,066 --> 01:27:28,664
- I'll be right back.
- You sure you wanna do that? - Yeah.

834
01:27:38,766 --> 01:27:41,137
What the fuck, man! I'm taking a shit!

835
01:27:41,392 --> 01:27:43,285
Just let go off me!

836
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,651
- Why did you put a code in the song?
- What you're talking about?

837
01:27:51,701 --> 01:27:53,563
- What are the tunnels for?
- What?

838
01:27:55,326 --> 01:27:57,972
- Why are you beating me?
- You understand "Turning Teeth".

839
01:27:58,015 --> 01:28:03,035
The fuck you coded. I need to know why you
put it there and what the fuck it means!

840
01:28:03,092 --> 01:28:04,152
Help!

841
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:09,404
- Fucking tell me!
- I don't know anything about a code.

842
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,438
- How could you not know? You wrote the fucking song.
- No, I didn't.

843
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:15,814
- I wrote most of them, but not that one.
- Bullshit.

844
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:18,694
Honestly! The label gave me a few songs to record.

845
01:28:18,785 --> 01:28:20,198
And the rest are all mine.

846
01:28:20,438 --> 01:28:22,224
Which songs they gave you?

847
01:28:22,267 --> 01:28:26,606
"Turning Teeth", "Wire Mountain", and
"Waltz of the Christian Shit Farmers".

848
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:30,706
- That's all of your hits.
- There's no reason to belittle me.

849
01:28:32,028 --> 01:28:35,431
- All right. So, who wrote the songs?
- I don't know. There're delivered anonymously.

850
01:28:35,473 --> 01:28:37,380
I got a call from someone of the label.

851
01:28:37,423 --> 01:28:41,103
They said not to ask any questions, but if I didn’t
record the songs I would lose my contract.

852
01:28:41,145 --> 01:28:43,626
Are you telling me you don't know
who wrote your own hit songs?

853
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:44,709
He didn’t give a name! No!

854
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:47,928
He just said it was an important piece of music
by the songwriter.

855
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,710
The songwriter?

856
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:53,286
Yeah! The songwriter!

857
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:56,300
Hey.

858
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:57,780
Hey.

859
01:28:58,581 --> 01:29:00,688
- Hey.
- Hm, what is it?

860
01:29:00,874 --> 01:29:03,568
Uh, you remember that party you told me about?

861
01:29:04,313 --> 01:29:07,407
A place in a neighborhood owned by some songwriter.

862
01:29:08,826 --> 01:29:10,439
Can you take me there?

863
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:14,124
Okay.

864
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:16,884
How do you all know each other?

865
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:18,858
We're roommates.

866
01:29:18,951 --> 01:29:20,144
We work together.

867
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:22,284
We're all Shooting Stars.

868
01:29:23,973 --> 01:29:25,644
- You too?
- Yeah.

869
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:28,302
I didn't know you're an actress.

870
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,489
I was on a soap opera between
the ages of five to six months.

871
01:30:26,091 --> 01:30:27,457
Come in, son.

872
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:38,443
Did you write the song "Turning Teeth"
for Jesus and the Brides of Dracula?

873
01:30:38,863 --> 01:30:40,476
And the codes in the music?

874
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,763
I found the tunnels and the bomb shelter.

875
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,223
Okay.

876
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:47,653
So, what does that all mean?

877
01:30:50,051 --> 01:30:52,971
Come and sit down. Here.

878
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:03,800
Is that...

879
01:31:06,803 --> 01:31:09,535
Is that Kurt Cobain's Fender Mustang guitar?

880
01:31:09,578 --> 01:31:13,550
Well, I don't know. Probably. I don't remember.

881
01:31:14,414 --> 01:31:16,181
I have so many things.

882
01:31:16,745 --> 01:31:18,159
Can I pick it up?

883
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:29,984
I don't always worry what the message is.
I just pass it along.

884
01:31:30,204 --> 01:31:32,447
I slip it between the notes.

885
01:31:32,669 --> 01:31:35,762
I hide it away from people who know it's there.

886
01:31:35,805 --> 01:31:37,355
You said you've done this before?

887
01:31:37,949 --> 01:31:38,950
Codes?

888
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,879
I wrote the music your dad grew up to.

889
01:31:42,726 --> 01:31:47,140
Half of what you're singing along to as a kid,
and I'm still good.

890
01:31:47,895 --> 01:31:51,308
And these teenagers are dancing to my music.

891
01:31:52,348 --> 01:31:55,748
♪ I want it that way ♪

892
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:58,355
- ♪ Tell me why ♪
- You're telling me there's...

893
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:01,943
hidden messages in old pop songs?

894
01:32:01,986 --> 01:32:04,932
In movies, television shows,

895
01:32:05,868 --> 01:32:07,580
everything you know.

896
01:32:09,548 --> 01:32:10,554
Why?

897
01:32:10,827 --> 01:32:12,647
That's pop culture, isn't it?

898
01:32:12,697 --> 01:32:15,110
You throw it away like tissue paper.

899
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,211
When I blow my nose,

900
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:21,467
I find a used Kleenex, I recycle it,

901
01:32:21,894 --> 01:32:24,534
and there is your wedding song.

902
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,180
Here it comes.

903
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,560

904
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:36,104
♪ And I want you to show me ♪

905
01:32:36,147 --> 01:32:38,409
What are the tunnels for? Is there gonna be a war?

906
01:32:38,647 --> 01:32:40,533
Aw, hell, I don't know.

907
01:32:41,285 --> 01:32:44,211
I'm just trying to make a living

908
01:32:44,665 --> 01:32:46,032
and earn a few dollars.

909
01:32:46,764 --> 01:32:48,631
Well, you have everything.

910
01:32:53,553 --> 01:32:54,665
No.

911
01:33:00,129 --> 01:33:01,562
You know this girl?

912
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:06,902
Well, isn't she pretty.

913
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,574

914
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,260

916
01:33:14,064 --> 01:33:16,772
...along with Jefferson Sevence' murder.

917
01:33:17,284 --> 01:33:20,041
- I think you already knew that, huh?
- No, I did not.

918
01:33:20,785 --> 01:33:24,724
But I don't care what's fashion or cool.

919
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:29,493
It's all silly and it's all meaningless.

920
01:33:30,511 --> 01:33:35,191
I created so many of the things that you care about.

921
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:40,368
The songs that give your life purpose and joy.

922
01:33:40,493 --> 01:33:45,701
When you were 15 and rebelling,
you were rebelling to my music.

923
01:33:49,497 --> 01:33:50,570
Uh-oh.

924
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:52,903
That one you know.

925
01:33:55,546 --> 01:34:00,462
That song was not written on a distorted guitar.

926
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:03,120
No, I wrote it.

927
01:34:03,326 --> 01:34:09,606
Here, on this piano, somewhere between
a blow-job and an omelet.

928
01:34:10,068 --> 01:34:11,955
There is no rebellion.

929
01:34:12,087 --> 01:34:14,861
There's only me earning a paycheck.

930
01:34:21,234 --> 01:34:23,442
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, good.

931
01:34:23,594 --> 01:34:29,694
Because the real message was not meant for you.
So, it's better if you just smile, and you dance,

932
01:34:29,737 --> 01:34:34,317
and you enjoy the melody,
because this ugly old man... me...

933
01:34:34,563 --> 01:34:37,660
I am the voice of your generation.

934
01:34:37,785 --> 01:34:42,791
Your grandparents, your parents,
and all the young people that follow you.

935
01:34:42,834 --> 01:34:45,340
♪ I love rock and roll ♪

936
01:34:45,383 --> 01:34:48,441
♪ Drop another dime in the jukebox, baby ♪

937
01:34:51,683 --> 01:34:54,057
Aw, look at you.

938
01:34:55,048 --> 01:35:02,261
Everything that you hoped for, that you dreamed about
being a part of, is a fabrication.

939
01:35:02,981 --> 01:35:04,470
Your art,

940
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:07,203
your writing,

941
01:35:08,366 --> 01:35:09,570
your culture...

942
01:35:10,664 --> 01:35:13,467
is the shell of other men's ambitions.

943
01:35:13,737 --> 01:35:18,030
Ambitions beyond what you will ever understand.

944
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:27,547
- That's funny to you?
- That's a little bit funny. Don't you think?

945
01:35:30,299 --> 01:35:31,948
Because I wrote this!

946
01:35:34,155 --> 01:35:35,661
And I wrote this!

947
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,768
And I wrote this.

948
01:35:42,076 --> 01:35:44,576
- Stop it.
- And I wrote this, too!

949
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:47,669
Stop it!

950
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:51,502
Who's paying you to write these songs?

951
01:35:54,518 --> 01:35:56,588
Who's paying you to write these songs?

952
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:58,742
Oh, shit!

953
01:37:01,076 --> 01:37:07,179
<i>Look! You fools, you're in danger!
Can't you see? They're after you!</i>

954
01:37:07,222 --> 01:37:10,950
<i>They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!</i>

955
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:15,153
<i>They're here already! You're next!</i>

956
01:38:53,138 --> 01:38:54,138
Fuck.

957
01:38:56,852 --> 01:38:57,852
Hi.

958
01:38:58,493 --> 01:39:01,910
I here to inform you that you have
to evacuate the premises immediately.

959
01:39:07,433 --> 01:39:10,769
- Is it about my rent?
- Yeah. You haven't paid. It's...

960
01:39:10,812 --> 01:39:13,299
...criminally overdue, it's what it is.

961
01:39:13,993 --> 01:39:15,889
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

962
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:21,380
- Ca... Can I please just get a couple more days?
- No, I don't think so.

963
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:26,867
Please. I haven't anywhere else to go, and I'm really,
really, close to getting the money. I promise.

964
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:27,989
Listen.

965
01:39:29,123 --> 01:39:32,257
I don't like this either. Worst part of my job. Okay?

966
01:39:36,898 --> 01:39:38,185
Yeah, I understand.

967
01:39:43,935 --> 01:39:48,231
- I can give you one more day. But that is it.
- Thank you.

968
01:39:48,505 --> 01:39:52,738
If you can't pay, I will not be
the nice guy you see right now.

969
01:39:52,781 --> 01:39:57,659
- No. No. I want him out... now!
- Hey.

970
01:39:58,954 --> 01:40:02,035
I'm handling this. Don't be greedy.

971
01:41:52,024 --> 01:41:54,331
- I like your shirt.
- <i>Yeah, think about it.</i>

972
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:56,447
<i>No duties. I mean it is...</i>

973
01:41:56,490 --> 01:42:01,285
<i>- ...like I want. That will on the highest south.
- Hm, can you bring me along?</i>

974
01:42:01,328 --> 01:42:03,167
<i>I'd love that. You could make the photos.</i>

975
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:09,940
<i>Okay, that girl is the youngest one to ever write, produce,
direct and sound design her own network's sitcom.</i>

976
01:42:09,983 --> 01:42:11,123
<i>How old is she?</i>

977
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:15,908
<i>She's 12, but she's really an old soul.
Honestly. She really captures the Zeitgeist.</i>

978
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:22,450
<i>I don't think there's any adult that could ever express that
kind of deep understanding that she has over her material.</i>

979
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:31,101
Hey.

980
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:34,348
How are you?

981
01:42:38,368 --> 01:42:40,076
Go... Good.

982
01:42:41,623 --> 01:42:43,150
I'm glad to hear that.

983
01:42:44,856 --> 01:42:45,870
Um...

984
01:42:46,701 --> 01:42:49,160
This is my fiance.

985
01:42:51,743 --> 01:42:54,039
- Hi. How are you?
- Hehehe.

986
01:42:55,566 --> 01:42:56,892
Congratulations.

987
01:42:57,433 --> 01:42:58,679
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

988
01:42:58,743 --> 01:43:00,539
Yeah, thank you.

989
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:06,056
- So, how is work?
- Great.

990
01:43:07,535 --> 01:43:08,537
Good.

991
01:43:10,553 --> 01:43:12,073
I saw your billboard.

992
01:43:14,493 --> 01:43:15,949
Cool. Which one?

993
01:43:17,756 --> 01:43:19,402
You've more than one?

994
01:43:21,836 --> 01:43:25,036
I only was aware of Los Feliz, right near the Bigfoot.

995
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:27,105
You know, I'm glad it's getting out there.

996
01:43:28,067 --> 01:43:31,374
You know... I'm working hard.

997
01:43:33,097 --> 01:43:34,814
Just... I gotta keep trying.

998
01:43:38,110 --> 01:43:40,327
Yeah. I mean... same here.

999
01:43:41,535 --> 01:43:44,389
Well, it was really great seeing you.

1000
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:46,948
You, too.

1001
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:19,667
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1002
01:44:19,954 --> 01:44:20,994
Yeah, it is.

1003
01:44:22,549 --> 01:44:24,429
- Do you know who painted it?
- No.

1004
01:44:25,066 --> 01:44:26,081
Gaynor.

1005
01:44:26,329 --> 01:44:28,420
It's Janet Gaynor, the actress.

1006
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:31,590
Wow.

1007
01:44:34,951 --> 01:44:36,830
My mom likes her.

1008
01:44:37,950 --> 01:44:39,704
Yeah, I like her, too.

1009
01:44:43,134 --> 01:44:44,481
Do you know who I am?

1010
01:44:45,408 --> 01:44:46,428
Yeah.

1011
01:44:47,514 --> 01:44:50,618
I was friends with one of the girls who was with your dad.

1012
01:44:52,743 --> 01:44:54,718
She was really a nice person.

1013
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:56,876
Huh.

1014
01:44:58,089 --> 01:45:00,443
I'm trying to find out what happened to her.

1015
01:45:02,952 --> 01:45:03,965
Really?

1016
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:09,608
What, do you know anything?

1017
01:45:17,142 --> 01:45:18,886
So, what do you think it all means?

1018
01:45:20,551 --> 01:45:21,786
I'm not sure, yet.

1019
01:45:23,172 --> 01:45:27,451
I can't... I can't quite see it, but I'm close, I think.

1020
01:45:31,551 --> 01:45:32,611
Oh, god.

1021
01:45:34,475 --> 01:45:37,050
I don't think we should be walking around here at night.

1022
01:45:38,797 --> 01:45:41,757
I think we're safe. We don't have a dog with us.

1023
01:45:42,535 --> 01:45:44,313
GOD WILL JUDGE YOU, DOG KILLER!

1024
01:45:44,362 --> 01:45:48,159
Yeah, but anybody who could kill a dog
wouldn't think twice about killing a person.

1025
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:52,031
I'm not sure if that's true.

1026
01:46:00,618 --> 01:46:03,160
Say, are you a cat person or a dog person?

1027
01:46:05,463 --> 01:46:10,269
It's hard to say. I got bit by my grandparents
terrier when I was a kid, so I...

1028
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:15,059
- I guess I'm a little afraid of them.
- Oh, god, that's awful.

1029
01:46:17,701 --> 01:46:19,334
Do you have a little change?

1030
01:46:24,451 --> 01:46:25,931
No. No.

1031
01:46:26,823 --> 01:46:30,217
- No. Sorry.
- No money to spare, huh?

1032
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:33,233
Does your lady know you're cheap?

1033
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:35,266
Fuck you!

1034
01:46:35,899 --> 01:46:40,425
Ugly piece of shit! Worthless twack! Motherfucker!

1035
01:46:40,752 --> 01:46:43,425
You're more broke than I am! Fuck you!

1036
01:46:44,152 --> 01:46:48,152
Come back here and sit down next to papa!
I'll shit in your mouth!

1037
01:46:48,195 --> 01:46:51,325
Asshole! Fucking dick twat!

1038
01:46:51,368 --> 01:46:55,368
I know it's not okay if I say this,
but I fucking hate the homeless.

1039
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:59,013
Everybody says we've to take care of them,
but I think they're fucking bullies.

1040
01:47:01,879 --> 01:47:03,273
Poltergeists.

1041
01:47:03,672 --> 01:47:05,997
- You mean ghosts?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1042
01:47:06,205 --> 01:47:07,531
All they do is just...

1043
01:47:07,631 --> 01:47:11,501
float around on the edges of the peripheries
and watch people

1044
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:16,232
eating delicious food, drinking beer, and falling in love.

1045
01:47:16,282 --> 01:47:19,726
They can't participate, feeling jealous,
and then they harass us.

1046
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:22,632
Why don't you just give him a dollar next time?

1047
01:47:25,475 --> 01:47:26,834
Have you ever been in there?

1048
01:47:27,694 --> 01:47:28,707
What?

1049
01:47:29,379 --> 01:47:30,954
- In the reservoir?
- Yeah.

1050
01:47:37,383 --> 01:47:38,546
Come on.

1051
01:48:13,633 --> 01:48:15,733
I think someone's been following me.

1052
01:48:18,261 --> 01:48:19,406
Are you kidding?

1053
01:48:20,008 --> 01:48:22,521
I wanted it to look like a creative screw.

1054
01:48:24,134 --> 01:48:25,261
We will not?

1055
01:48:28,015 --> 01:48:31,356
I found this hidden in my dad's office.

1056
01:48:45,294 --> 01:48:48,074
H6 to G4. Like a chess move?

1057
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:51,951
- Your dad played chess?
- Yeah, he did.

1058
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:55,924
Get down. Get down!

1059
01:49:46,781 --> 01:49:48,385
H6 to G4.

1060
01:49:50,339 --> 01:49:52,074
What the fuck are you saying?

1061
01:49:52,937 --> 01:50:00,544
H6 to G4. H... 6... to G... 4.

01:50:13,313 --> 01:50:14,780
NPM. NPM.

01:50:20,999 --> 01:50:23,321
What does NPM stand for?

Nintendo Power Magazine, issue 1.

Page 35 to page 37. 35 to 37.

1075
01:51:03,554 --> 01:51:08,576
Okay. Page 35. 35, 36, 37.

1079
01:51:39,713 --> 01:51:41,313
Calm down. Calm down.

1080
01:51:41,875 --> 01:51:43,166
H6.

1081

1084
01:51:50,053 --> 01:51:53,986
H6 to G4.

1085
01:51:54,357 --> 01:51:56,179
What the fuck should I do with that?

1086
01:52:01,609 --> 01:52:03,863
- Marco!
- Polo!

1087
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:06,254
- Marco!
- Polo!

1088
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,160
SECRET MAP INSIDE EVERY BOX!

1089
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:03,109
Fuck. He has it.

1090
01:53:11,477 --> 01:53:14,774
Wow. Oh, my god. You were right.

1091
01:53:15,206 --> 01:53:16,534
You were right.

1092
01:53:19,410 --> 01:53:23,830
H6... to G4.

1093
01:53:25,372 --> 01:53:29,076
So, that's the reservoir, and that's Mount Hollywood.

1094
01:53:54,391 --> 01:53:56,410
SATELLITE IMAGE UNAVAILABLE

1095
01:53:56,453 --> 01:53:58,506
What the fuck is in there?

1096
01:54:24,243 --> 01:54:27,493
THIS IS NOT A SAFE PLACE

1097
01:55:17,648 --> 01:55:18,648
Hello.

1098
01:55:20,268 --> 01:55:21,328
Can I help you?

1099
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:22,888
Yeah.

1100
01:55:24,118 --> 01:55:25,817
My friend Sarah was killed.

1101
01:55:28,015 --> 01:55:30,010
These three girls know something about it.

1102
01:55:31,946 --> 01:55:33,358
Why do you assume that?

1103
01:55:34,379 --> 01:55:35,513
I don't assume it.

1104
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:38,610
I saw her

1105
01:55:39,317 --> 01:55:40,690
taking things

1106
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,450
from Sarah's apartment,

1107
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:46,023
and I found a... a hidden code in their friend's music,

1108
01:55:46,529 --> 01:55:47,950
and I've been in the tunnels.

1109
01:55:48,349 --> 01:55:49,349
All right.

1110
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:52,142
Please, sit down.

1111
01:55:53,553 --> 01:55:54,648
Have some tea.

1112
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:00,193
I found... a shelter down there.

1113
01:56:03,010 --> 01:56:05,016
Some... some kind of bunker,

1114
01:56:05,577 --> 01:56:07,303
in case of a nuclear war.

1115
01:56:07,346 --> 01:56:08,559
It's not a shelter.

1116
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,026
So, what is it?

1117
01:56:10,684 --> 01:56:11,719
A tomb.

1118
01:56:12,546 --> 01:56:13,793
Was it ours?

1119
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:18,906
They're tombs for kings

1120
01:56:19,099 --> 01:56:20,112
like me

1121
01:56:20,933 --> 01:56:22,820
and Jefferson Sevence.

1122
01:56:28,868 --> 01:56:31,668
Why would Jefferson Sevence need a tomb
underneath the city?

1123
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:34,061
Is the cemetery not good enough for him?

1124
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:36,547
It's not about a burial.

1125
01:56:37,188 --> 01:56:38,548
It's about ascension.

1126
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:45,134
We're not dying, we'll be transported to
another world, somewhere better than this.

1127
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:48,767
- Are you talking about heaven?
- No.

1128
01:56:49,107 --> 01:56:51,067
I'm talking about something

1129
01:56:52,287 --> 01:56:53,519
exclusive

1130
01:56:54,571 --> 01:56:55,837
and real.

1131
01:56:56,947 --> 01:56:59,989
Our souls are gonna be pulled from our bodies

1132
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:03,860
and carried through this unfathomable amniotic sac.

1133
01:57:04,032 --> 01:57:10,700
We will be beyond this universe,
living together like kings, without limitation.

1134
01:57:11,848 --> 01:57:13,228
The pharaohs did it.

1135
01:57:13,648 --> 01:57:16,590
Great men throughout the history have done the same.

1136
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,214
Are you dying?

1137
01:57:18,328 --> 01:57:22,868
Not, but I'll be sealed in a tomb with my beautiful brides

1138
01:57:23,341 --> 01:57:25,867
and all with my worldly possessions,

1139
01:57:26,003 --> 01:57:29,826
and we are going to have delicious meals,

1140
01:57:30,629 --> 01:57:35,162
and wine, and television, and sex,

1141
01:57:36,362 --> 01:57:38,248
enough to last six months.

1142
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:40,620
- And then you die?
- No.

1143
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:42,507
We wait to be ascended.

1144
01:57:43,785 --> 01:57:47,111
Only the richest of men can afford this ceremony.

1145
01:57:47,441 --> 01:57:48,659
It's expensive

1146
01:57:48,798 --> 01:57:51,358
to build a tunnel system and keep it hidden.

1147
01:57:53,644 --> 01:57:55,184
But it costs much more

1148
01:57:55,715 --> 01:57:58,204
to murder people without being harassed about it.

1149
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:01,997
Did you kill Sarah?

1150
01:58:14,014 --> 01:58:16,760
No one will find our chambers for a thousand years.

1151
01:58:18,651 --> 01:58:20,714
In the future men will understand

1152
01:58:22,539 --> 01:58:24,191
that we were modern kings.

1153
01:58:25,076 --> 01:58:29,499
Rulers without statues or effigies.

1154
01:58:29,663 --> 01:58:30,796
She was here?

1155
01:58:35,245 --> 01:58:36,618
Oh, fuck.

1156
01:58:37,785 --> 01:58:39,154
Is Sarah alive?

1157
01:58:39,386 --> 01:58:42,147
She may have ascended already. I don't know.

1158
01:58:42,754 --> 01:58:46,212
She's down there in one of those things, those tombs?

1159
01:58:49,349 --> 01:58:52,213
- With Jefferson Sevence?
- Yes.

1160
01:58:53,069 --> 01:58:54,443
They found his body.

1161
01:58:54,643 --> 01:58:58,836
They found another man's bones
mixed with most of Jefferson's teeth,

1162
01:58:59,037 --> 01:59:00,417
some of his skin,

1163
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:04,357
and all the organs that he can live without.

1164
01:59:09,555 --> 01:59:11,653
Ow, such an angry thing to do.

1165
01:59:16,303 --> 01:59:17,813
What are you upset about?

1166
01:59:20,994 --> 01:59:22,573
I just wanna see Sarah.

1167
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,246
Well...

1168
01:59:26,515 --> 01:59:28,620
Why don't we see if we can get her on the phone.

1169
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:31,820
Do you have a phone?

1170
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:35,073
Incoming calls only. We had trouble in the past.

1171
01:59:35,873 --> 01:59:38,333
People getting scared and try to get out.

1172
01:59:38,399 --> 01:59:39,879
She's trapped down there?

1173
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:42,585
You don't wanna lose out on eternal life

1174
01:59:42,692 --> 01:59:48,278
just because we might have a normal physical aversion
to being buried underneath the earth.

1175
01:59:48,332 --> 01:59:49,818
That's only human.

1176
01:59:54,605 --> 01:59:55,605
Fuck.

1177
02:00:00,633 --> 02:00:01,633
Hello.

1178
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:04,463
How're you?

1179
02:00:06,243 --> 02:00:07,257
Uh-huh.

1180
02:00:08,394 --> 02:00:09,954
Okay. Good.

1181
02:00:11,887 --> 02:00:14,394
Do you mind if I put you on videophone?

1182
02:00:15,665 --> 02:00:19,451
A friend of yours is here. He wants to see you. Great.

1183
02:00:31,327 --> 02:00:32,333
<i>Hello?</i>

1184
02:00:33,059 --> 02:00:36,400
- Sarah, can you... can you hear me?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1185
02:00:42,826 --> 02:00:44,697
I... I've been looking for you.

1186
02:00:45,311 --> 02:00:46,324
<i>Really?</i>

1187
02:00:48,813 --> 02:00:50,014
<i>You hardly know me.</i>

1188
02:00:51,707 --> 02:00:53,328
Yeah, I know, uh...

1189
02:00:55,091 --> 02:00:58,305
Are you annoyed at me, or angry?

1190
02:00:58,364 --> 02:00:59,591
Did I sound angry?

1191
02:01:00,104 --> 02:01:01,104
Oh.

1192
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:04,184
<i>Well, no, I just wanted to know what happened to you.</i>

1193
02:01:04,244 --> 02:01:05,251
Oh.

1194
02:01:07,644 --> 02:01:09,957
<i>Uh, you really wanna be down there?</i>

1195
02:01:16,076 --> 02:01:17,079
Yeah.

1196
02:01:18,618 --> 02:01:21,112
You're go... You're gonna die down there. Um...

1197
02:01:24,843 --> 02:01:26,243
Is that what you want?

1198
02:01:30,618 --> 02:01:33,791
<i>I'm gonna take this in the other room.
Will you hang it up when I get in there?</i>

1199
02:01:33,834 --> 02:01:34,847
<i>Sure.</i>

1200
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:49,278
<i>Their chamber was covered in a mountain of concrete.</i>

1201
02:01:49,564 --> 02:01:50,900
<i>It can't be opened.</i>

1202
02:01:51,499 --> 02:01:53,430
There's no reason to upset that girl.

1203
02:01:54,084 --> 02:01:55,370
Please, be kind.

1204
02:02:08,515 --> 02:02:09,588
<i>Got it!</i>

1205
02:02:09,809 --> 02:02:10,829
<i>Okay.</i>

1206
02:02:16,743 --> 02:02:18,427
<i>Do you think I've made a mistake</i>

1207
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:22,350
<i>coming down here?</i>

1208
02:02:25,747 --> 02:02:27,291
May... maybe.

1209
02:02:41,975 --> 02:02:42,975
<i>Well...</i>

1210
02:02:43,148 --> 02:02:46,188
<i>there's no getting out now,
so I may as well make the best of it.</i>

1211
02:02:57,266 --> 02:02:58,266
Yeah.

1212
02:03:05,193 --> 02:03:06,474
Same here.

1213
02:03:11,863 --> 02:03:12,863
<i>So...</i>

1214
02:03:14,075 --> 02:03:15,082
<i>how're you?</i>

1215
02:03:20,109 --> 02:03:21,254
Not great.

1216
02:03:22,969 --> 02:03:25,567
<i>Have you thought about getting a new dog?</i>

1217
02:03:31,274 --> 02:03:32,299
No.

1218
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:34,440
<i>Maybe it'd be good for you.</i>

1219
02:03:35,261 --> 02:03:37,061
<i>An unconditional love.</i>

1220
02:03:40,210 --> 02:03:41,567
Yeah, I'll think about it.

1221
02:03:54,035 --> 02:03:57,141
Well, I better get going.
I said I'd make dinner tonight and

1222
02:03:57,416 --> 02:03:59,214
I've a million things to do.

1223
02:04:00,884 --> 02:04:01,891
<i>Okay.</i>

1224
02:04:03,392 --> 02:04:06,059
<i>Well, enjoy... your dinner.</i>

1225
02:04:09,698 --> 02:04:10,758
Take care.

1226
02:04:18,553 --> 02:04:19,560
Bye.

1227
02:04:45,181 --> 02:04:46,352
Last night...

1228
02:04:47,556 --> 02:04:50,885
I had a vision of us making love beneath the earth.

1229
02:04:52,429 --> 02:04:57,499
And we were swimming together, naked, in a dark pool.

1230
02:04:58,696 --> 02:05:00,389
And that's when it happens.

1231
02:05:01,323 --> 02:05:04,723
Our bodies dissolved into light.

1232
02:05:05,487 --> 02:05:10,973
And every beautiful thought we've ever had
roams around us,

1233
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:15,116
and carries our souls through space

1234
02:05:15,716 --> 02:05:17,434
into another world.

1235
02:05:18,575 --> 02:05:20,241
And we're all just

1236
02:05:20,508 --> 02:05:23,442
laughing the whole time because we know

1237
02:05:24,341 --> 02:05:26,601
that nothing can ever be wrong again.

1238
02:05:34,305 --> 02:05:36,420
I wish you were coming with us.

1239
02:05:44,834 --> 02:05:50,980
This isn't a world that anyone with any sense stays in

1240
02:05:51,511 --> 02:05:53,750
or spends much time worrying about.

1241
02:05:54,433 --> 02:05:56,197
You're living a carnival,

1242
02:05:56,685 --> 02:06:01,058
throwing little plastic rings at oversized pop bottles

1243
02:06:01,645 --> 02:06:03,545
hoping to win a price.

1244
02:06:05,532 --> 02:06:06,785
What are you gonna win?

1245
02:06:09,357 --> 02:06:10,891
A two week vacation?

1246
02:06:12,397 --> 02:06:13,684
A new car?

1247
02:06:15,371 --> 02:06:17,717
A little money to retire on?

1248
02:06:19,609 --> 02:06:21,371
It's all just a

1249
02:06:22,516 --> 02:06:26,322
shitty sawdust filled rabbit.

1250
02:06:29,951 --> 02:06:31,796
The things you care about

1251
02:06:32,742 --> 02:06:34,762
are useless where we're going.

1252
02:06:55,769 --> 02:06:57,856
Why have I come to this horrible place?

1253
02:07:25,783 --> 02:07:28,333
How did you know I was here?

1254
02:07:29,856 --> 02:07:31,062
We smell you.

1255
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,160
Huh.

1256
02:07:56,729 --> 02:07:58,043
Ah, fuck.

1257
02:08:01,511 --> 02:08:03,902
What happened to that man and those girls?

1258
02:08:06,743 --> 02:08:09,756
They were waking up right now in their ascension chamber.

1259
02:08:11,446 --> 02:08:13,399
Are you gonna kill me?

1260
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:16,439
Do you know what you did wrong?

1261
02:08:17,593 --> 02:08:18,593
No.

1262
02:08:23,701 --> 02:08:27,434
We found these in your pocket.

1263
02:08:28,576 --> 02:08:32,216
Why do you have dog biscuits in your pocket?

1264
02:08:33,743 --> 02:08:34,889
I used to...

1265
02:08:36,216 --> 02:08:38,596
I liked a girl who had a dog.

1266
02:08:40,658 --> 02:08:41,958
When was that?

1267
02:08:46,372 --> 02:08:47,713
A long time ago.

1268
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,786
Did she stop loving you?

1269
02:08:57,292 --> 02:08:58,299
Yeah.

1270
02:09:02,105 --> 02:09:07,518
Why do you have dog biscuits in your pocket?

1271
02:09:10,689 --> 02:09:12,916
Because I was waiting for her to take me back.

1272
02:09:21,507 --> 02:09:24,115
I wanted to give the dog a treat and rub its ears.

1273
02:09:27,972 --> 02:09:30,845
Just the way I used to, and then
everything would be good again.

1274
02:10:03,337 --> 02:10:04,531
You can go now.

1275
02:10:06,602 --> 02:10:07,612
Really?

1276
02:10:08,831 --> 02:10:09,845
Yeah.

1277
02:10:12,284 --> 02:10:13,390
You're not...

1278
02:10:15,897 --> 02:10:17,317
not gonna kill me?

1279
02:10:18,003 --> 02:10:21,216
I don't think so. We might. I'm not sure, yet.

1280
02:10:23,036 --> 02:10:28,410
But, obviously, don't mention any of this to anyone.

1281
02:10:28,535 --> 02:10:29,569
I won't.

1282
02:10:31,942 --> 02:10:33,122
Okay.

1283
02:10:43,203 --> 02:10:44,269
Dag.

1284
02:10:44,796 --> 02:10:45,809
Bye.

1285
02:11:30,243 --> 02:11:35,451
I CAN SEE C... HAMBURGERS ARE LOVE

1286
02:12:11,243 --> 02:12:13,993
I'M NOT USED TO BEING HAPPY...

1287
02:12:18,118 --> 02:12:20,243
IT'S FUNNY... IT HURTS.

1288
02:12:34,326 --> 02:12:35,951
I'M AFRAID!

1289
02:12:47,118 --> 02:12:49,535
NEVER LOOK DOWN... ALWAYS LOOK UP!

1290
02:12:57,913 --> 02:12:59,000
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1291
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:02,540
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1292
02:13:08,179 --> 02:13:09,539
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1293
02:13:11,345 --> 02:13:12,465
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1294
02:13:39,393 --> 02:13:40,757
Is that patchouli?

1295
02:13:43,895 --> 02:13:45,290
No.

1296
02:13:46,355 --> 02:13:47,382
Hm.

1297
02:13:51,063 --> 02:13:52,343
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1298
02:13:58,057 --> 02:13:59,223
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1299
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,866
What's that bird saying?

1300
02:14:03,915 --> 02:14:05,128
I don't know.

1301
02:14:05,848 --> 02:14:09,288
Honestly I always wondered, but I have no idea.

1302
02:14:09,669 --> 02:14:10,809
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1303
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:15,490
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1304
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:18,450
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1305
02:14:54,286 --> 02:14:56,083
<i>I mean, look at this shit.</i>

1306
02:14:59,326 --> 02:15:06,726
<i>That all over here had to be taken out
to clear the apartment...</i>

1307
02:15:09,881 --> 02:15:13,141
<i>God damn it! Look what he painted there!
What is that?</i>
