00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:18,006
CAMERA WHIRS

2
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,266
Who's there? Nay, answer me!

3
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,066
Stand, and unfold yourself.

4
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:44,386
Long live the king! Bernardo? He.

5
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,506
You come most carefully
upon your hour.

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:50,706
'Tis now struck twelve -
get thee to bed, Francisco.

7
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,106
For this relief much thanks.

8
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:57,186
'Tis bitter cold,
and I am sick at heart.

9
00:00:57,186 --> 00:01:01,466
Have you had quiet guard?

10
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,146
Not a mouse stirring.

11
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:06,586
Well, good night.

12
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:10,546
Stand, ho! Who's there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.

13
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:14,066
Give you good night.
Farewell, honest soldier.

14
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,626
Who hath relieved you?

15
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,986
Bernardo has my place.

16
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:21,066
Give you good night.

17
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,746
Holla! Bernardo!

18
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:28,826
Say, what, is Horatio there?

19
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:36,066
A piece of him. Welcome, Horatio,
welcome, good Marcellus.

20
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,986
What, has this thing
appeared again tonight?

21
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:40,746
I have seen nothing.

22
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:43,266
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

23
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,306
and will not let belief
take hold of him.

24
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,546
Touching this dreaded sight,
twice seen of us.

25
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:51,186
Therefore I have entreated him
along with us

26
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:53,266
to watch the minutes of this night,

27
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:57,306
that if again the apparition come,

28
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:59,386
he may approve our eyes
and speak to it.

29
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,026
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

30
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,866
Then let us once again
assail your ears,

31
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:06,386
that are so fortified
against our story

32
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,226
what we have two nights seen.

33
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:12,026
Well, let us hear Bernardo
speak of this.

34
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:13,346
Last night of all,

35
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:16,346
when yond same star
that's westward from the pole

36
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,266
had made his course to illume
that part of heaven

37
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,546
where now it burns,
Marcellus and myself,

38
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,106
the bell then beating one...

39
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:25,306
Peace! Break thee off.

40
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,746
Look, where it comes again!

41
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:32,026
In the same figure,
like the king that's dead.

42
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,666
Thou art a scholar -
speak to it, Horatio.

43
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,106
Looks it not like the king?
Mark it, Horatio.

44
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:41,706
Most like, it harrows me with fear
and wonder. It would be spoke to.

45
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,346
Question it, Horatio.

46
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:47,426
What art thou
that usurp'st this time of night,

47
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,586
together with that
fair and warlike form

48
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,746
in which the majesty of buried
Denmark did sometimes march?

49
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:54,746
By heaven I charge thee, speak!

50
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:57,346
It is offended. See, it stalks away!

51
00:02:57,346 --> 00:03:01,546
Stay! Speak, speak!
I charge thee, speak!

52
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:03,546
'Tis gone,

53
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:05,226
and will not answer.

54
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,906
Before my God,
I might not this believe

55
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,786
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes.

56
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:14,866
Thus twice before,
and jump at this dead hour,

57
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,586
with martial stalk
hath he gone by our watch.

58
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:20,146
In what particular
thought to work I know not,

59
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,546
but in the gross and scope
of my opinion,

60
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:25,426
this bodes some strange eruption
to our state.

61
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:31,666
Good now, stand close,
and tell me, he that knows,

62
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,866
why this same strict
and most observant watch

63
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,706
so nightly toils
the subject of the land,

64
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,666
and why such daily cast
of brazen cannon

65
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,466
and foreign mart
for implements of war.

66
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:47,106
What might be toward,
that this sweaty haste

67
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,626
doth make the night
joint-labourer with the day?

68
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,626
Who is't that can inform me?

69
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,746
That can I -

70
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:57,026
at least, the whisper goes so.

71
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,426
Our last king,

72
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,826
whose image
even but now appear'd to us,

73
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:07,906
Was, as you know,
by Fortinbras of Norway

74
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:11,266
dared to the combat,
in which our valiant Hamlet

75
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,106
did slay this Fortinbras, who thus

76
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:16,066
did forfeit, with his life,
all these his lands.

77
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:18,986
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

78
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:20,906
of unimproved mettle hot and full,

79
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,226
hath in the skirts of Norway
here and there

80
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:25,586
shark'd up a list
of lawless resolutes,

81
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,106
to recover of us
those foresaid lands

82
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:31,826
so by his father lost.
And this, I take it,

83
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,586
is the main motive
of our preparations,

84
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:37,706
the source of this our watch
and the chief head

85
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:40,586
of this post-haste
and romage in the land.

86
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,626
But soft, behold!
lo, where it comes again!

87
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,426
I'll cross it, though it blast me.
Stay, illusion!

88
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:48,786
If thou hast any sound,
or use of voice, speak to me.

89
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,586
If thou art privy
to thy country's fate,

90
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:53,786
which, happily,
foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!

91
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,786
COCK CROWS

92
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,746
Stay, and speak!

93
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,866
Stop it, Marcellus.

94
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,986
Shall I strike at it?
Do, if it will not stand.

95
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,586
'Tis here! 'Tis here!

96
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,706
'Tis gone!

97
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,386
We do it wrong, being so majestical,

98
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:17,506
to offer it the show of violence.

99
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:24,306
For it is, as is the air,
invulnerable,

100
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,626
and our vain blows
malicious mockery.

101
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,146
It was about to speak,
when the cock crew.

102
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,266
And then it started
like a guilty thing

103
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,586
upon a fearful summons.

104
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:36,586
It faded on the crowing of the cock.

105
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,706
Some say that ever
'gainst that season comes

106
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,826
wherein our Saviour's birth
is celebrated,

107
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:47,106
the bird of dawning singeth
all night long

108
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:51,826
and then, they say,
no spirit dares stir abroad.

109
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:56,346
The nights are wholesome,
then no planets strike,

110
00:05:56,346 --> 00:06:01,586
no fairy takes,
nor witch hath power to charm,

111
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,506
so hallow'd and so gracious
is the time.

112
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:08,306
So have I heard
and do in part believe it.

113
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:15,306
But, look -
the morn, in russet mantle clad,

114
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:18,066
walks o'er the dew
of yond high eastward hill.

115
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:29,066
Break we our watch up,
and by my advice,

116
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,586
let us impart
what we have seen tonight

117
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:36,906
unto young Hamlet,
for, upon my life,

118
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:43,586
this spirit, dumb to us,
will speak to him.

119
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:51,826
Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death

120
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,586
the memory be green...

121
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:57,666
And that it us befitted

122
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,746
to bear our hearts in grief
and our whole kingdom

123
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:05,626
to be contracted
in one brow of woe.

124
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:10,226
Yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature

125
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:14,266
that we with wisest sorrow
think on him,

126
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:17,586
together with remembrance
of ourselves.

127
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:22,426
Therefore our sometime sister,
and our queen,

128
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:26,826
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state,

129
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:32,146
have we,
as 'twere with a defeated joy,

130
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:36,586
with one auspicious
and one dropping eye,

131
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:40,986
with mirth in funeral
and with dirge in marriage,

132
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:45,426
in equal scale weighing delight
and dole,

133
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,106
taken to wife.

134
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:49,226
APPLAUSE

135
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,586
Nor have we herein barr'd

136
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:55,466
your better wisdoms,
which have freely gone

137
00:07:55,466 --> 00:08:00,586
with this affair along.
For all, our thanks.

138
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:06,746
Now follows, that you know,
young Fortinbras,

139
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:10,786
holding a weak supposal
of our worth,

140
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:15,226
or thinking by our late
dear brother's death

141
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:19,586
our state to be disjoint
and out of frame,

142
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:22,746
he hath not fail'd
to pester us with message,

143
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:25,666
importing the surrender
of those lands

144
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,266
lost by his father,
with all bonds of law,

145
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:34,186
to our most valiant brother.

146
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,746
So much for him.

147
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:38,746
Thus much the business is.

148
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:39,746
We have here writ

149
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:40,866
We have here writ

150
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,786
To Norway,
uncle of young Fortinbras,

151
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:46,666
that he suppress
his nephew's further march

152
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,786
and threatening enterprise
against our state.

153
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:53,666
And we here dispatch you,
good Cornelia,

154
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,866
and Voltimand as our ambassadors
to old Norway.

155
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:01,026
In that and in all things
we show our duty.

156
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:03,746
We doubt it nothing.
Heartily farewell.

157
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:15,866
And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?

158
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:20,346
You told us of some suit -
what is't, Laertes?

159
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,266
LAUGHTER

160
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:26,226
You cannot speak of reason
to the Dane

161
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,826
and lose your voice.

162
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,306
My dread lord,

163
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:35,026
your leave and favour
to return to France,

164
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,506
from whence though willingly
I came to Denmark,

165
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,306
to show my duty in your coronation,

166
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,906
yet now, I must confess,
that duty done,

167
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:46,506
ny thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France

168
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:49,746
and bow them
to your gracious leave and pardon.

169
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:53,626
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

170
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,906
He hath, my lord,
wrung from me my slow leave.

171
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,426
I do beseech you,
give him leave to go.

172
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:04,946
Take thy fair hour, Laertes -
time be thine,

173
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,906
and thy best graces
spend it at thy will!

174
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,946
But now,

175
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,146
our cousin Hamlet, and our son.

176
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,346
A little more than kin,
and less than kind.

177
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,746
How is it that the clouds
still hang on you?

178
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,786
Not so, my lord,
I am too much i' the sun.

179
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:30,546
Good Hamlet,
cast thy nighted colour off,

180
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,906
and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.

181
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,306
Do not for ever
with thy vail-ed lids

182
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:39,906
seek for thy noble father
in the dust.

183
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:43,906
Thou know'st 'tis common,
all that lives must die,

184
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,626
passing through nature to eternity.

185
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:49,506
Ay, madam, it is common. If it be,

186
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:52,746
why seems it
so particular with thee?

187
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:56,186
Seems, madam! Nay, it is,
I know not "seems".

188
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:58,586
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother,

189
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,826
nor customary suits of solemn black,

190
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,586
together with all forms,
moods, shapes of grief,

191
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:06,666
that can denote me truly.
These indeed seem,

192
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,106
for they are actions
that a man might play.

193
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:12,146
But I have that within
which passeth show

194
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:15,466
these but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

195
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,946
Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,

196
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,906
to give these mourning duties
to your father.

197
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:27,466
But, you must know,
your father lost a father,

198
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:31,866
that father lost, lost his,
and the survivor, bound

199
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:35,306
in filial obligation for some term

200
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,226
to do obsequious sorrow.

201
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:42,146
But to persever
in obstinate condolement

202
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:46,186
is a course of impious stubbornness.

203
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:50,026
'Tis unmanly grief.

204
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,706
I pray you, throw to earth

205
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:56,586
This unprevailing woe,
and think of us

206
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:01,106
as of a father,
for let the world take note,

207
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,666
you are the most immediate
to our throne,

208
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,026
and with no less nobility of love

209
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,906
than that which dearest father
bears his son,

210
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,186
do I impart toward you.

211
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,266
APPLAUSE

212
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,546
For your intent

213
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:22,346
In going back to school
in... Wittenberg. ..Wittenberg,

214
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,626
it is most retrograde
to our desire.

215
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:27,426
And I beseech you,
bend you to remain here,

216
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,866
in the cheer and comfort
of our eye,

217
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:35,546
our chiefest courtier, cousin,
and our son.

218
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:42,266
Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

219
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:46,186
I pray thee, stay with us -
go not to Wittenberg.

220
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:48,066
I shall in all my best obey you,
madam.

221
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:52,746
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

222
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,906
Be as ourself in Denmark.

223
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,666
APPLAUSE

224
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,466
Madam, come.

225
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:03,786
This gentle and unforced accord
of Hamlet

226
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:06,906
sits smiling to my heart
in grace whereof,

227
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:10,066
no jocund health
that Denmark drinks today.

228
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,826
But the great cannon
to the clouds shall tell,

229
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:17,466
re-speaking earthly thunder.
Come, away.

230
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:42,506
O, that this too, too solid flesh
would melt...

231
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,866
Thaw,

232
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:52,626
and resolve itself into a dew!

233
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,746
Or that the Everlasting
had not fix'd

234
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,546
his canon 'gainst self-slaughter!

235
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,306
O God!

236
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,986
God!

237
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,786
HE SOBS

238
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:20,146
How weary,

239
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:22,866
stale,

240
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:25,186
flat and unprofitable

241
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:28,066
seem to me all the uses
of this world!

242
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,266
Fie on't! Fie!

243
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:37,546
'Tis an unweeded garden,
that grows to seed.

244
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:43,906
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.

245
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,826
That it should come to this!

246
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,066
But two months dead -

247
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,266
nay, not so much, not two!

248
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:05,226
So excellent a king,
that was, to this,

249
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,626
Hyperion to a satyr.

250
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,266
So loving to my mother

251
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:14,146
That he might not beteem
the winds of heaven

252
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,386
visit her face too roughly.
Heaven and earth!

253
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,066
Must I remember?

254
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:25,666
Why, she would hang on him,

255
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,186
as if increase of appetite
had grown

256
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,866
by what it fed on
and yet, within a month...!

257
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,906
Let me not think on't.

258
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:35,146
Frailty, thy name is woman!

259
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:39,066
A little month,
or 'ere those shoes were old

260
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:42,706
with which she follow'd
my poor father's body,

261
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:47,346
like Niobe, all tears
why she, even she...!

262
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,626
O, God! A beast,
that wants discourse of reason,

263
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:53,426
would have mourn'd longer.

264
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:55,826
Married with my uncle.

265
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:03,946
My father's brother,
but no more like my father

266
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:07,866
than I to Hercules within a month.

267
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:15,226
'Ere yet the salt
of most unrighteous tears

268
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:18,946
had left the flushing
in her galled eyes,

269
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:21,346
she married.

270
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,546
O, most wicked speed, to post

271
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:29,866
with such dexterity
to incestuous sheets!

272
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:38,266
It is not, nor it cannot
come to good.

273
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:48,826
But break, my heart,
for I must hold my tongue.

274
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:55,026
Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see thee well.

275
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,626
Horatio!

276
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,826
Or I do forget myself!

277
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,466
The same, my lord,
and your poor servant ever.

278
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:05,706
Sir, my good friend,
I'll change that name with you.

279
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:09,226
And what make you from
Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?

280
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:12,026
My good lord. I am very glad
to see you. Good even, sir.

281
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:14,586
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

282
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:17,546
We'll teach you to drink deep
'ere you depart.

283
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:20,546
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

284
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:23,226
I pray thee, do not mock me,
fellow-student -

285
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,386
I think it was to see
my mother's wedding.

286
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:28,906
Indeed, my lord,
it follow'd hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!

287
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,986
The funeral baked meats

288
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:34,186
did coldly furnish forth
the marriage tables.

289
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,786
My father!

290
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,986
Methinks I see my father.

291
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,066
Where, my lord?

292
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:46,266
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

293
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:53,986
I saw him once.
He was a goodly king.

294
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,506
He was a man.
Take him for all in all.

295
00:17:59,226 --> 00:18:01,706
I shall not look upon
his like again.

296
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,106
My lord...

297
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:11,266
I think I saw him yesternight.
Saw who?

298
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:14,066
My lord, the king your father.

299
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:18,426
The king my father!

300
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:23,186
Season your admiration with an
attent ear, till I may deliver,

301
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,426
upon the witness of these gentlemen,
this marvel to you.

302
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:28,346
For God's love, let me hear.

303
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,826
Two nights together
had these gentlemen,

304
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:33,426
Marcellus and Bernardo,
on their watch,

305
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,786
in the dead vast
and middle of the night,

306
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:37,866
been thus encounter'd.

307
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,466
A figure like your father,

308
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,426
Armed at point exactly,
cap-a-pe,

309
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,786
appears before them,
and with solemn march

310
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:47,226
goes slow and stately by them.
This to me

311
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,346
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,

312
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:52,186
and I with them the third night
kept the watch

313
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:56,466
where, as they had deliver'd,
the apparition comes.

314
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,666
I knew your father,
these hands are not more like.

315
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,226
But where was this? My lord, upon
the platform where we watch'd.

316
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,226
Did you not speak to it?

317
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:08,506
My lord, I did, but answer
made it none. 'Tis very strange.

318
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:11,026
As I do live, my honour'd lord,
'tis true.

319
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,986
And we did think it
writ down in our duty

320
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,186
to let you know of it. Indeed.

321
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:20,426
Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

322
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,826
Hold you the watch tonight?
We do, my lord.

323
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,866
Arm'd, say you? Arm'd, my lord.
From top to toe?

324
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,306
My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?

325
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:31,146
O, yes, my lord,
he wore his beaver up.

326
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:36,506
What look'd he - frowningly?

327
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,786
A countenance
more in sorrow than in anger.

328
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,906
Pale or red? Nay, very pale.

329
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:43,506
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.

330
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:46,826
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.

331
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:50,586
Very like, very like.

332
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:52,026
Stay'd it long?

333
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:55,666
While one with moderate haste might
tell a hundred. Longer, longer.

334
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,786
Not when I saw't.

335
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:59,666
His beard was grizzled?

336
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,546
It was, as I have seen it
in his life,

337
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:06,586
a sable silver'd.

338
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:09,746
I will watch tonight -
perchance 'twill walk again.

339
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,586
I warrant it will.

340
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,266
If it assume
my noble father's person,

341
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,386
I'll speak to it,
though Hell itself should gape

342
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,106
and bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all,

343
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,746
if you have hitherto
conceal'd this sight,

344
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:21,706
let it be tenable
in your silence still,

345
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:24,186
and whatsoever else
shall hap to-night,

346
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:26,626
give it an understanding,
but no tongue.

347
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,586
I will requite your loves.

348
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,506
So, fare you well.

349
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,946
Upon the platform, 'twixt
eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.

350
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:35,026
ALL: Our duty to your honour.

351
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:40,506
My father's spirit in arms!
All is not well.

352
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,546
I doubt some foul play.

353
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:47,346
Would the night were come!

354
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,146
Till then sit still, my soul.

355
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,946
Foul deeds will rise,

356
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,746
though all the earth o'erwhelm them,
to men's eyes.

357
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:02,066
My necessaries are embark'd.

358
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,066
Farewell.

359
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,466
And, sister,
as the winds give benefit

360
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,226
and as convoy is assistant,
do not sleep,

361
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,866
but let me hear from you.

362
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:14,986
Do you doubt that?

363
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:24,426
For Hamlet and the trifling
of his favour,

364
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:29,026
hold it a fashion
and a toy in blood,

365
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:32,546
a violet
in the youth of primy nature.

366
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:36,386
Forward, not permanent,
sweet, not lasting.

367
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,866
The perfume and suppliance
of a minute - no more.

368
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:45,786
No more but so? Think it no more.
Perhaps he loves you now,

369
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:49,266
and now no soil nor cautel
doth besmirch

370
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,106
the virtue of his will.
But you must fear,

371
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:55,426
his greatness weigh'd,
his will is not his own.

372
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:58,226
For he himself
is subject to his birth.

373
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:01,986
He may not,
as unvalued persons do,

374
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:05,666
carve for himself,
for on his choice depends

375
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,706
the safety and the health
of this whole state.

376
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:11,346
And therefore must his choice
be circumscribed

377
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:15,226
unto the voice and yielding of
that body whereof he is the head.

378
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,786
Then if he says he loves you,

379
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:23,026
it fits your wisdom
so far to believe it

380
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:26,026
as he in his particular act
and place

381
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:29,346
may give his saying deed -
which is no further

382
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:32,386
than the main voice of Denmark
goes withal.

383
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:39,026
Then weigh what loss
your honour may sustain,

384
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,546
if with too credent ear
you list his songs.

385
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:44,106
DISTANT THUMP

386
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:49,306
Or lose your heart,
or your chaste treasure open

387
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,586
To his unmaster'd importunity.

388
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:54,106
Fear it, Ophelia!

389
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:58,306
Fear it, my dear sister,

390
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:01,546
and keep you
in the rear of your affection,

391
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,666
out of the shot
and danger of desire.

392
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:13,266
Be wary, then.
Best safety lies in fear.

393
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,026
Youth to itself rebels,
though none else near.

394
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:18,906
I shall the effect
of this good lesson keep,

395
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:22,786
as watchman to my heart.
But, good my brother,

396
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:25,186
do not,
as some ungracious pastors do,

397
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,826
show me the steep and thorny way
to Heaven,

398
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:31,706
whiles, like a puff'd and reckless
libertine,

399
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:35,626
himself the primrose path
of dalliance treads,

400
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,906
and recks not his own rede.
O, fear me not.

401
00:23:40,906 --> 00:23:42,946
I stay too long,
but here my father comes.

402
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:46,706
A double blessing is a double grace,
occasion smiles upon a second leave.

403
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:49,906
Yet here, Laertes!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

404
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:55,026
The wind sits in the shoulder of
your sail, and you are stay'd for.

405
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:57,106
There, my blessing with thee!

406
00:23:57,106 --> 00:24:01,146
And these few precepts
in thy memory

407
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:05,546
see thou character.
Give thy thoughts no tongue,

408
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,306
nor any unproportioned thought
his act.

409
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:12,746
Be thou familiar,
but by no means vulgar.

410
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:15,826
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried,

411
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:18,266
grapple them to thy soul
with hoops of steel.

412
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,626
But do not dull thy palm
with entertainment

413
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:25,426
of each new-hatch'd,
unfledged comrade. Beware

414
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:28,386
Of entrance to a quarrel,
but being in,

415
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:31,506
bear't that the opposed
may beware of thee.

416
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:36,346
Give every man thy ear,
but few thy voice,

417
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:40,786
take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.

418
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:44,626
Costly thy habit
as thy purse can buy,

419
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:50,346
but not express'd in fancy!
Rich, not gaudy,

420
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:53,426
for the apparel
oft proclaims the man.

421
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:56,626
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
for loan...

422
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,426
..oft loses both
itself and friend...

423
00:24:58,426 --> 00:25:01,946
And borrowing...
..dulls the edge of husbandry.

424
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:03,586
This above all.

425
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,706
To thine ownself be true,

426
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:10,226
And it must follow,
as the night the day,

427
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,226
thou canst not then
be false to any man.

428
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,226
Farewell.

429
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:21,426
My blessing season this in thee!

430
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,266
Most humbly do I take my leave,
my lord.

431
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:30,306
The time invites you -
go, your servant tends.

432
00:25:30,306 --> 00:25:32,106
Farewell, Ophelia.

433
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:36,506
And remember well
what I have said to you.

434
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,466
Tis in my memory lock'd,

435
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,666
and you yourself
shall keep the key of it.

436
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,906
Farewell.

437
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:50,866
DOOR CLOSES

438
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:54,546
What is't, Ophelia,
he hath said to you?

439
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:57,786
So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

440
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,466
Marry, well bethought.

441
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:02,946
'Tis told me,
he hath very oft of late

442
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:06,546
Given private time to you,
and you yourself

443
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:09,906
have of your audience
been most free and bounteous.

444
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:11,826
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,

445
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:14,546
and that in way of caution,
I must tell you,

446
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:17,586
you do not understand yourself
so clearly

447
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:21,906
as it behoves my daughter
and your honour.

448
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:24,426
What is between you?
Give me up the truth.

449
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:27,506
He hath, my lord,
of late made many tenders

450
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:29,346
of his affection to me.

451
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:31,506
Affection! Pah!

452
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,786
You speak like a green girl,

453
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:37,426
unsifted
in such perilous circumstance.

454
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:41,106
Do you believe his tenders,
as you call them?

455
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:44,946
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.

456
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:49,946
Marry, I'll teach you.
Think yourself a baby,

457
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:52,266
That you have ta'en these tenders
for true pay,

458
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:55,586
which are not Sterling.
Tender yourself more dearly,

459
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:58,306
or, not to crack the wind
of the poor phrase,

460
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,586
running it thus
you'll tender me a fool.

461
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,386
My lord,
he hath importuned me with love

462
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:05,466
in honourable fashion.

463
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:08,066
Ay, fashion you may call it -
go to, go to.

464
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,706
And hath given countenance to
his speech, my lord,

465
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:12,786
with almost all
the holy vows of Heaven.

466
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:17,386
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
I do know,

467
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,666
when the blood burns,
how prodigal the soul

468
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:23,626
lends the tongue vows.
These blazes, daughter,

469
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:26,426
giving more light than heat,
extinct in both,

470
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:29,346
you must not take for fire.
From this time

471
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:31,666
be somewhat scanter
of your maiden presence,

472
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:35,266
for Lord Hamlet, believe so much
in him, that he is young

473
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:38,146
and with a larger tether may he walk

474
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:40,066
than may be given you.

475
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:43,066
In few, Ophelia,
do not believe his vows.

476
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:49,066
This is for all.

477
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:53,026
I would not, in plain terms,
from this time forth,

478
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:56,506
have you so slander
any moment leisure,

479
00:27:56,506 --> 00:28:00,266
as to give words or talk
with the Lord Hamlet.

480
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:04,506
Look to't, I charge you.

481
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:06,666
Come your ways.

482
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,506
I shall obey, my lord.

483
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:16,866
The air bites shrewdly -
it is very cold.

484
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,666
It is a nipping and an eager air.

485
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,866
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.

486
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,666
No, it is struck.
Indeed? I heard it not.

487
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,266
Then it draws near the season

488
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,946
wherein the spirit
held his wont to walk.

489
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:35,706
BANG

490
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:38,746
FIREWORK
What does this mean, my lord?

491
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:42,426
The king doth wake tonight
and takes his rouse,

492
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:46,026
Keeps wassail,
and the swaggering up-spring reels.

493
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:50,426
And, as he drains his draughts of
Rhenish down,

494
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:53,546
The kettle-drum
and trumpet thus bray out

495
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:56,146
The triumph of his pledge.
Is it a custom?

496
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:58,866
Ay, marry, is't.

497
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:02,026
But to my mind,
though I am native here

498
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:05,426
and to the manner born,
it is a custom

499
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:08,106
more honour'd in the breach
than the observance.

500
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:10,866
FIREWORKS EXPLODE

501
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,546
Look, my lord, it comes!

502
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:20,026
Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!

503
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,986
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damn'd?

504
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:30,746
Bring with thee airs from
Heaven or blasts from Hell?

505
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:34,466
Be thy intents
wicked or charitable,

506
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:37,346
thou comest in such
a questionable shape

507
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:40,146
that I will speak to thee.

508
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:43,026
I'll call thee Hamlet,

509
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:45,306
King,

510
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:47,186
father,

511
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,746
royal Dane. O, answer me!

512
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,106
Let me not burst in ignorance,
but tell

513
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:56,386
why thy canonised bones,
hearsed in death,

514
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:59,866
have burst their cerements.
Why the sepulchre,

515
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,706
wherein we saw thee
quietly inter'd,

516
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:05,506
hath oped his ponderous
and marble jaws,

517
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:09,866
to cast thee up again.
What may this mean,

518
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:15,746
that thou, dead corpse,
again in complete steel

519
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:18,746
revisits thus
the glimpses of the moon,

520
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:22,386
making night hideous,
and we fools of nature

521
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:25,386
so horridly to shake
our disposition

522
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:28,546
with thoughts beyond
the reaches of our souls?

523
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,746
Say, why is this?

524
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,586
Wherefore?

525
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,546
What should we do?

526
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:45,266
It beckons you to go away with it,

527
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,906
As if it some impartment did desire
to you alone.

528
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:50,786
It waves you to a more removed
ground. But do not go with it.

529
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:53,266
No, by no means. It will not speak,
then I will follow it.

530
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,226
Do not, my lord.
Why, what should be the fear?

531
00:30:55,226 --> 00:30:56,826
I do not set my life in a pin's fee.

532
00:30:56,826 --> 00:31:00,786
And for my soul,
what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?

533
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:02,986
It waves me forth again,
I'll follow it.

534
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,026
What if it tempt you
toward the flood, my lord,

535
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,106
or to the dreadful summit
of the cliff

536
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:09,826
that beetles o'er his base
into the sea,

537
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,626
and there assume
some other horrible form,

538
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:14,026
which might deprive your sovereignty
of reason

539
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:16,026
and draw you into madness?
It waves me still.

540
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:17,826
Go on, I'll follow thee.
You shall not go, my lord.

541
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:20,426
Hold off your hands!
Be ruled - you shall not go.

542
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:21,506
My fate cries out,

543
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,866
and makes each
petty artery in this body

544
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:26,426
as hardy as
the Nemean lion's nerve.

545
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,666
Still am I call'd.
Unhand me, gentlemen.

546
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,946
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him
that lets me!

547
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:34,386
I say, away!

548
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:40,066
Go on, I'll follow thee.

549
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:44,626
He waxes desperate with imagination.

550
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,666
Let's follow - 'tis not fit
thus to obey him. Have after.

551
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:50,266
To what issue will this come?

552
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:53,026
Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.

553
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:56,466
Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let's follow.

554
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:01,266
Where wilt thou lead me?
Speak, I'll go no further.

555
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:05,426
Mark me. I will.
My hour is almost come,

556
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:08,386
when I to sulphurous
and tormenting flames

557
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,906
must render up myself.

558
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,586
Alas, poor ghost!

559
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:13,386
Pity me not,

560
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:16,426
but lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

561
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:20,026
Speak, I am bound to hear.

562
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:23,186
So art thou to revenge,
when thou dost hear.

563
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:24,786
What?

564
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:27,026
I am thy father's spirit,

565
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:32,626
doom'd for a certain term
to walk the night,

566
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:37,826
and for the day confined
to fast in fires,

567
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:42,826
till the foul crimes
done in my days of nature

568
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:46,826
are burned and purged away.
But that I am forbid

569
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:50,306
to tell the secrets
of my prison-house,

570
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:54,306
I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word

571
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:58,666
would harrow up thy soul,
freeze thy young blood,

572
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:03,186
make thy two eyes, like stars,
start from their spheres.

573
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:06,946
But this eternal blazon
must not be

574
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:09,706
to ears of flesh and blood.

575
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:13,986
List, list, O, list!

576
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:17,026
If thou didst ever
thy dear father love... O God!

577
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:23,066
..Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder. Murder!

578
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,506
Murder most foul!

579
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,586
As in the best it is,

580
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:31,586
but this most foul,
strange and unnatural.

581
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:34,946
Haste me to know't,
that I, with wings as swift

582
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,226
as meditation
or the thoughts of love,

583
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,786
may sweep to my revenge.

584
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,466
I find thee apt.

585
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:49,026
'Tis given out
that, sleeping in my orchard,

586
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:52,226
a serpent stung me.

587
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:54,106
But know,

588
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:56,186
thou noble youth,

589
00:33:56,186 --> 00:34:00,746
The serpent that did sting
thy father's life

590
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,986
now wears his crown.

591
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:06,186
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!

592
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:11,866
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast,

593
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:15,586
with witchcraft of his wit,

594
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:22,186
with traitorous gifts,
won to his shameful lust

595
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:25,986
the will of my most
seeming-virtuous queen.

596
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:31,986
O Hamlet,
what a falling-off was there!

597
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:37,946
From me,
whose love was of that dignity

598
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:42,386
that it went hand in hand
even with the vow

599
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:48,586
I made to her in marriage,
and to decline

600
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,586
upon a wretch
whose natural gifts were poor

601
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:54,346
to those of mine!

602
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:58,546
But lust,
though to a radiant angel link'd,

603
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:02,026
will sate itself
in a celestial bed,

604
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:03,986
and prey on garbage.

605
00:35:03,986 --> 00:35:05,226
But, soft!

606
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:12,146
Methinks I scent the morning air.

607
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,386
Brief let me be.

608
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:18,386
Sleeping within my orchard,

609
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:20,946
my custom always in the afternoon,

610
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:24,346
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,

611
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:31,466
with juice of curs-ed hebenon
in a vial,

612
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:35,106
and in the porches of my ears
did pour

613
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:37,906
the leperous distilment,
whose effect

614
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:40,426
holds such an enmity
with blood of man

615
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:43,866
that swift as quicksilver
it courses through

616
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:46,586
the natural gates and alleys
of the body,

617
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:50,426
and with a sudden vigour doth posset

618
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:54,746
and curd
the thin and wholesome blood.

619
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:58,106
So did it mine,

620
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:03,586
and a most instant tetter
bark'd about,

621
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:08,466
most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust,

622
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,666
all my smooth body.

623
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:19,386
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand

624
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:27,146
of life, of crown, and queen,
at once dispatch'd.

625
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:30,906
O, horrible!

626
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:33,786
Most horrible! O God!

627
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,786
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not!

628
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:39,866
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

629
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:43,186
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

630
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,746
But, howsoever
thou pursuest this act,

631
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:55,786
taint not thy mind,
nor let thy soul contrive

632
00:36:55,786 --> 00:37:00,786
against thy mother aught.
Leave her to Heaven

633
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,946
and to those thorns
that in her bosom lodge,

634
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:08,586
to prick and sting her.
Fare thee well at once!

635
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:14,666
The glow-worm shows the matin
to be near,

636
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,346
and 'gins to pale
his ineffectual fire.

637
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:24,906
Adieu, adieu!

638
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:29,106
Hamlet...

639
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:33,346
VOICE ECHOES
Remember me!

640
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:39,826
O all you host of Heaven!

641
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:42,106
O Earth! What else?

642
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:45,506
And shall I couple Hell? O, fie!

643
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,106
Hold, hold, my heart.

644
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:51,826
And you, my sinews,
grow not instant old,

645
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:55,826
but bear me stiffly up.
Remember thee?!

646
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:59,746
Ay, thou poor ghost,
while memory holds a seat

647
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:02,506
in this distracted globe.
Remember thee?!

648
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,586
Yea, from the table of my memory

649
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:07,346
I'll wipe away
all trivial fond records,

650
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:09,946
All saws of books, all forms,
all pressures past,

651
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:12,186
that youth and observation
copied there.

652
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:14,586
And thy commandment
all alone shall live

653
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,826
within the book and volume
of my brain,

654
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:20,946
unmix'd with baser matter.
Yes, by Heaven!

655
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:28,426
O most pernicious woman!

656
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:32,506
O villain,

657
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:36,226
villain,

658
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:38,906
smiling, damned villain!

659
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:41,106
My tables,
meet it is I set it down,

660
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:45,306
that one may smile, and smile,

661
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,506
and be a villain.

662
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:50,506
At least,

663
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:52,906
I'm sure it may be so in Denmark.

664
00:38:56,946 --> 00:39:03,946
So, uncle, there you are.

665
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,626
Now to my word.

666
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:17,026
It is "Adieu, adieu! Remember me."

667
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:20,586
I have sworn 't.

668
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:25,066
My lord, my lord! Heaven secure him!
So be it!

669
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,746
Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

670
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:29,586
Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.

671
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:32,306
How is't, my noble lord?

672
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:36,106
What news, my lord? O, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.

673
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,506
No, you'll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by Heaven.

674
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:40,546
Nor I, my lord. How say you, then?

675
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:43,826
Would heart of man once think it?

676
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:46,186
But you'll be secret?
Ay, by Heaven, my lord.

677
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:51,186
There's ne'er a villain
dwelling in all Denmark

678
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:53,066
but he's an arrant knave.

679
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:55,866
There needs no ghost
come from the grave to tell us this.

680
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:57,266
Why, right, you are i' the right,

681
00:39:57,266 --> 00:40:00,306
And so, without more circumstance
at all, I hold it fit
that we shake hands and part.

682
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,306
You, as your business and desire
shall point you,

683
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:04,266
for every man
has business and desires,

684
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,306
such as it is,
and for mine own poor part,

685
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:07,466
look you, I'll go pray.

686
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:10,186
These are but wild and whirling
words, my lord.

687
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:13,066
I'm sorry they offend you,
heartily. Yes, 'faith heartily.

688
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:15,706
There's no offence, my lord.

689
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:20,306
Yes, by Saint Patrick,
but there is, Horatio,

690
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:22,146
and much offence too.

691
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:24,626
Touching this vision here,

692
00:40:24,626 --> 00:40:28,466
it is an honest ghost,
that let me tell you

693
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:30,186
for your desire
to know what is between us,

694
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:32,306
O'ermaster 't as you may.
And now, good friends,

695
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,666
as you are friends, scholars
and soldiers,

696
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,026
give me one poor request.

697
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:38,346
What is't, my lord? We will.

698
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:41,226
Never make known
what you have seen tonight.
BOTH: My lord, we will not.

699
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:43,346
Nay, but swear it.

700
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:45,186
In faith, my lord, not I.

701
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:48,506
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.

702
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:51,346
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

703
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:53,866
ECHOING VOICE: Swear. Ah, ha, boy!

704
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:56,306
Say'st thou so?
Art thou there, truepenny?

705
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:58,906
Come on, you hear this fellow
in the cellarage -

706
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:01,106
consent to swear.
Propose the oath, my lord.

707
00:41:01,106 --> 00:41:03,706
Never to speak of this that you
have seen, swear by my sword.

708
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:04,906
ECHOING VOICE: Swear!

709
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:07,106
Hic et ubique?
Then we'll shift our ground.

710
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:10,626
Come hither, gentlemen, and lay
your hands again upon my sword.

711
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,706
Never to speak of this
that you have heard.

712
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:15,226
Swear by my sword.
ECHOING VOICE: Swear!

713
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:17,146
Well said, old mole!

714
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:19,466
Canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer!

715
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,106
Once more remove, good friends.

716
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,946
O day and night,
but this is wondrous strange!

717
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:27,306
And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.

718
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:30,666
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,

719
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,666
than are dreamt of
in our philosophy. But come!

720
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,106
Here, as before, never,
so help you mercy,

721
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:39,506
how strange or odd soe',
er I bear myself,

722
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:42,666
As I perchance hereafter
shall think meet

723
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,026
to put an antic disposition on,

724
00:41:45,026 --> 00:41:47,506
that you, at such times seeing me,
never shall,

725
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:50,506
with arms encumber'd thus,
or this headshake,

726
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:52,746
or by pronouncing of
some doubtful phrase,

727
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:56,026
As "Well, well, we know",'
or "We could, and if we would",

728
00:41:56,026 --> 00:41:59,106
or such ambiguous giving out,
to note

729
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:03,746
that you know aught of me.
This not to do,

730
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:08,026
so grace and mercy at your most need
help you - swear!

731
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,746
LOUD ECHOING VOICE: Swear!

732
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:11,706
We swear! We swear!

733
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:17,426
Rest, rest, perturb-ed spirit!

734
00:42:26,786 --> 00:42:29,186
So, gentlemen,

735
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:31,306
let us go in together;

736
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:34,146
and still your fingers
on your lips, I pray.

737
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:43,346
The time is out of joint.

738
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:48,066
O cursed spite,

739
00:42:51,826 --> 00:42:55,146
that ever I was born
to set it right!

740
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:09,666
Give my son this money and these
notes, Reynaldo. I will, my lord.

741
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:12,866
You shall do marvellous wisely,
good Reynaldo,

742
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:16,346
before you visit him,
to make inquire of his behaviour.

743
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,226
My lord, I did intend it.

744
00:43:18,226 --> 00:43:22,266
Marry, well said, very well said.
Look you, sir,

745
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,026
inquire me first
what Danskers are in Paris,

746
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:28,506
and how, and who, what means,
and where they keep,

747
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:31,106
what company, at what expense,
and finding

748
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:34,306
by this encompassment
and drift of question

749
00:43:34,306 --> 00:43:37,066
that they do know my son,
come you more nearer.

750
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:40,666
Take you, as 'twere,
some distant knowledge of him

751
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:44,466
as thus,
"I know his father and his friends,

752
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,946
"And in part him."
Do you mark this, Reynaldo?

753
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:49,946
Ay, very well, my lord.

754
00:43:49,946 --> 00:43:53,826
And in part him,
but you may say "not well.

755
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:57,626
"But, if't be he I mean,
he's very wild,

756
00:43:57,626 --> 00:44:01,266
"addicted so and so",
and there put on him

757
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:05,466
what forgeries you please.
Marry, none so rank

758
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:08,586
as may dishonour him,
take heed of that,

759
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:11,826
but, sir, such wanton, wild
and usual slips

760
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:15,386
as are companions noted
and most known

761
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,386
to youth and liberty.

762
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:19,226
As gaming, my lord?

763
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:24,546
Ay, or drinking, fencing,
swearing, quarrelling,

764
00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:27,626
drabbing - you may go so far.

765
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:31,906
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Faith, no, as you may season it
in the charge.

766
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:34,426
But, my good lord...
Wherefore should you do this?

767
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:37,906
Ay, my lord, I would know that.
Marry, sir, here's my drift,

768
00:44:37,906 --> 00:44:40,026
and I believe, it is a fetch of wit.

769
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:42,506
You laying these slight sullies
on my son,

770
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:45,626
as 'twere a thing a little
soil'd i' the working, mark you,

771
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:48,986
your party in converse,
him you would sound,

772
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,786
having ever seen
in the prenominate crimes

773
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:54,906
the youth you breathe of guilty,
be assured

774
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:57,626
he closes with you
in this consequence.

775
00:44:57,626 --> 00:45:02,746
"Good sir," or so, or "friend",
or "gentleman",'

776
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:05,306
according to the phrase
or the addition

777
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:07,026
of man and country.

778
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:09,226
Very good, my lord.

779
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:11,466
And then, sir, does he this?

780
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,506
He does...

781
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:26,106
What was I about to say?

782
00:45:26,106 --> 00:45:29,386
By the mass,
I was about to say something.

783
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,226
Where did I leave?

784
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:33,506
At closes in the consequence.

785
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:37,866
At closes in the consequence?
Ay, marry!

786
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:40,906
He closes thus -
"I know the gentleman,

787
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,986
"I saw him yesterday,
or t' other day,

788
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:47,666
"Or then, or then,
with such, or such,

789
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,746
"and, as you say,
there was a' gaming,

790
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:53,106
"there a falling out at tennis"
or perchance,

791
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:58,546
"I saw him enter
such a house of sale" -

792
00:45:58,546 --> 00:46:04,426
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now -

793
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:11,266
your bait of falsehood
takes this carp of truth

794
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:14,026
and thus do we of wisdom
and of reach,

795
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:19,186
by indirections
find directions out.

796
00:46:19,186 --> 00:46:22,066
You have me, have you not?
My lord, I have.

797
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:24,026
God be wi' you -

798
00:46:24,026 --> 00:46:26,306
fare you well. Good my lord!

799
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:30,186
Observe his inclinations in yourself.

800
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:34,386
I shall, my lord.
And let him ply his music.

801
00:46:34,386 --> 00:46:36,986
Well, my lord.

802
00:46:36,986 --> 00:46:38,866
Farewell!

803
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:40,506
Oh.

804
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,546
How now, Ophelia! What's the matter?

805
00:46:42,546 --> 00:46:46,026
O, my lord, my lord,
I have been so affrighted!

806
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:47,586
With what, i' the name of God?

807
00:46:47,586 --> 00:46:50,746
My lord,
as I was sewing in my closet,

808
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:54,346
Lord Hamlet,
with his doublet all unbraced,

809
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:57,426
no hat upon his head,
his stockings foul'd,

810
00:46:57,426 --> 00:47:00,186
ungarter'd,
and down-gyved to his ankle,

811
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:03,906
pale as his shirt,
his knees knocking each other,

812
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:08,346
and with a look so piteous
in purport

813
00:47:08,346 --> 00:47:10,466
as if he had been loosed out of Hell

814
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:13,026
to speak of horrors,
he comes before me.

815
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:16,026
Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know,

816
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:20,426
but truly, I do fear it.
What said he?

817
00:47:20,426 --> 00:47:24,346
He took me by the wrist
and held me hard.

818
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:26,706
Then goes he
to the length of all his arm,

819
00:47:26,706 --> 00:47:29,866
and, with his other hand thus
o'er his brow,

820
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:33,386
he falls to such perusal of my face

821
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:35,386
as he would draw it.

822
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,346
Long stay'd he so.

823
00:47:38,346 --> 00:47:41,626
At last,
a little shaking of mine arm

824
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:45,426
and thrice his head
thus waving up and down,

825
00:47:45,426 --> 00:47:49,586
he raised a sigh
so piteous and profound

826
00:47:49,586 --> 00:47:53,346
as it did seem to shatter
all his bulk

827
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,186
and end his being.

828
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:58,906
That done, he lets me go

829
00:47:58,906 --> 00:48:02,706
and, with his head
over his shoulder turn'd,

830
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,786
he seem'd to find his way
without his eyes.

831
00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:11,266
For out o' doors
he went without their help,

832
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,626
and, to the last,
bended their light on me.

833
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:19,386
Come.
This is the very ecstasy of love,

834
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:21,986
whose violent property fordoes itself

835
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:25,426
and leads the will
to desperate undertakings.

836
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:27,586
I am sorry.

837
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:30,706
What, have you given him
any hard words of late?

838
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,946
No, my good lord,
but, as you did command,

839
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:36,266
I did repel his fetters and denied

840
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:40,186
his access to me.
That hath made him mad.

841
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:43,226
I am sorry that with better heed
and judgment

842
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:45,986
I had not quoted him.
I fear'd he did but trifle,

843
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:50,866
and meant to wreck thee,
but, beshrew my jealousy!

844
00:48:50,866 --> 00:48:54,146
Come, go we to the king.

845
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:57,066
This must be known.

846
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:04,746
Welcome,
dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!

847
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,986
Moreover that we much did
long to see you,

848
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:10,666
the need we have to use you
did provoke

849
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,986
our hasty sending.
Something have you heard

850
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:18,026
of Hamlet's transformation.
What it should be,

851
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:21,546
more than his father's death,
that thus hath put him

852
00:49:21,546 --> 00:49:25,506
so much from the understanding
of himself,

853
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:28,586
we cannot dream of. I beseech you

854
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:33,106
that, being of such young days
brought up with him,

855
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:36,346
that you vouchsafe your rest
here in our court

856
00:49:36,346 --> 00:49:39,106
some little time
so by your companies

857
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:43,946
to lead him on to pleasures,
and to gather,

858
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:47,426
so much as by occasion
you may glean,

859
00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:50,546
whether aught, to us unknown,
afflicts him thus,

860
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:52,986
that, open'd,
lies within our remedy.

861
00:49:52,986 --> 00:49:56,066
Good gentlemen,
he hath much talk'd of you,

862
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:58,546
and sure I am two men there are
not living

863
00:49:58,546 --> 00:50:01,146
to whom he more adheres.
If it will please you

864
00:50:01,146 --> 00:50:03,346
to show us
so much gentry and good will

865
00:50:03,346 --> 00:50:05,226
as to expend your time with us
awhile,

866
00:50:05,226 --> 00:50:08,266
for the supply and profit
of our hope,

867
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:11,306
your visitation
shall receive such thanks

868
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:13,386
as fits a king's remembrance.

869
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,746
Both your majesties

870
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,986
might, by the sovereign power
you have of us,

871
00:50:16,986 --> 00:50:19,226
put your dread pleasures
more into command

872
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:20,306
than to entreaty.

873
00:50:20,306 --> 00:50:22,906
But we both obey,

874
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:25,706
and here give up ourselves,
in the full bent

875
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:28,546
to lay our service freely
at your feet, to be commanded.

876
00:50:28,546 --> 00:50:31,626
Thanks, Rosencrantz
and gentle Guildenstern.

877
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:35,106
Thanks, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.

878
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:38,426
And I beseech you instantly to
visit my too much changed son.

879
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,546
Go, some of you, and bring these
gentlemen where Hamlet is.

880
00:50:41,546 --> 00:50:43,586
Heavens make our presence
and our practises

881
00:50:43,586 --> 00:50:44,946
pleasant and helpful to him!

882
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:47,626
Ay, amen!

883
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:50,586
The ambassadors from Norway,
my good lord,

884
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:52,186
are joyfully return'd.

885
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:54,946
Thou still hast been
the father of good news.

886
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:56,626
Have I, my lord?

887
00:50:56,626 --> 00:51:01,706
I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,

888
00:51:01,706 --> 00:51:05,386
both to my God
and to my gracious king.

889
00:51:05,386 --> 00:51:08,866
And I do think, that I have found

890
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:12,786
the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

891
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:15,986
O, speak of that -
that do I long to hear.

892
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:18,626
First give admittance
to the ambassadors -

893
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:21,386
my news shall be
the fruit unto the feast.

894
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:24,386
Thyself do grace to them,
and bring them in.

895
00:51:24,386 --> 00:51:30,106
He tells me, my sweet Gertrude,
that he hath found

896
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:33,706
the head and source
of all your son's distemper.

897
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:35,786
I doubt it is no other
but the main -

898
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:38,026
his father's death,

899
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:40,906
and our o'erhasty marriage.

900
00:51:40,906 --> 00:51:43,226
We will sift him.

901
00:51:44,386 --> 00:51:47,026
Welcome, good friends!

902
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:49,546
Say, what from our brother Norway?

903
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:52,346
Most fair return of
greetings and desires.

904
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:54,626
He sent out to suppress
his nephew's march.

905
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:56,826
The which he thought proposed
against the Poles,

906
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,746
but, better look'd into,
he truly found

907
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:01,346
it was against Your Highness
and our state.

908
00:52:01,346 --> 00:52:03,666
So Fortinbras
receives rebuke from him

909
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:06,106
and vows before his uncle never more

910
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,506
to give assay of arms
against Denmark here.

911
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:10,666
Ha!

912
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:15,306
It likes us well.

913
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,746
At night we'll feast together.

914
00:52:17,746 --> 00:52:19,186
Most welcome home!

915
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:24,586
This business is well ended.

916
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:29,786
My liege, and madam, to expostulate

917
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:34,026
what majesty should be, what duty is,

918
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:39,026
why day is day, night night,

919
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:43,586
and time...is time.

920
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:51,186
Were nothing but to waste night,
day and time.

921
00:52:51,186 --> 00:52:53,546
Therefore,
since brevity is the soul of wit,

922
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,266
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes,

923
00:52:56,266 --> 00:52:59,266
I will be brief.
Your noble son is mad. Ah!

924
00:52:59,266 --> 00:53:03,906
Mad call I it,
for, to define true madness,

925
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:08,306
what is't
but to be nothing else but mad?

926
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:11,506
But let that go.
More matter, with less art.

927
00:53:11,506 --> 00:53:15,426
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

928
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:18,386
That he is mad, 'tis true,
'tis true 'tis pity,

929
00:53:18,386 --> 00:53:21,186
and pity 'tis 'tis true,
a foolish figure.

930
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:23,786
But farewell it,
for I will use no art.

931
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:26,906
Mad let us grant him, then
and now remains

932
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:29,906
that we find out the cause
of this effect,

933
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,266
or rather say,
the cause of this defect,

934
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:35,946
for this effect
defective comes by cause.

935
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:40,346
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus.

936
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:44,626
I have a daughter,
have while she is mine

937
00:53:44,626 --> 00:53:47,586
who, in her duty and obedience,
mark,

938
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:49,146
hath given me this.

939
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:53,426
Now gather, and surmise.

940
00:53:53,426 --> 00:53:59,666
"To the celestial and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia,"

941
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:02,426
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase.

942
00:54:02,426 --> 00:54:08,306
"Beautified" is a vile phrase,
but you shall hear. Thus.

943
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:14,706
"In her excellent white...bosom,
these..."

944
00:54:14,706 --> 00:54:18,266
HE TUTS
..etc.

945
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:20,706
Came this from Hamlet to her?

946
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:24,306
Good madam, stay awhile,
I will be faithful.

947
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:27,826
"Doubt thou the stars are fire
doubt that the sun doth move,

948
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:32,506
"doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love."

949
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:35,946
This, in obedience, hath my
daughter shown me, and more above.

950
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:38,226
But how hath she received his love?

951
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:40,146
What do you think of me?

952
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:43,426
As of a friend,
faithful and honourable.

953
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:46,746
I would fain prove so.
But what might you think,

954
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:50,306
When I had seen this hot love
on the wing

955
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:52,826
as I perceived it,
I must tell you that,

956
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:55,106
before my daughter told me
what might you,

957
00:54:55,106 --> 00:54:57,746
Or my dear majesty your queen here,
think,

958
00:54:57,746 --> 00:55:01,266
If I had given my heart a winking,
mute and dumb,

959
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:03,386
or look'd upon this love
with idle sight?

960
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:04,986
No, I went round to work,

961
00:55:04,986 --> 00:55:07,786
and my young mistress
thus I did bespeak.

962
00:55:07,786 --> 00:55:10,986
"Lord Hamlet is a prince,
out of thy star -

963
00:55:10,986 --> 00:55:14,266
"this must not be."
And then I precepts gave her,

964
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:17,106
that she should lock herself
from his resort,

965
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:19,546
admit no messengers,
receive no tokens.

966
00:55:19,546 --> 00:55:22,666
Which done,
she took the fruits of my advice.

967
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:26,066
And he, repulsed,
a short tale to make

968
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:30,746
fell into a sadness,
then into a fast,

969
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:33,426
thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness,

970
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:36,346
thence to a lightness,
and, by this declension,

971
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,946
Into the madness
wherein now he raves,

972
00:55:40,106 --> 00:55:42,226
and all we mourn for.

973
00:55:42,226 --> 00:55:44,026
Do you think 'tis this?

974
00:55:46,306 --> 00:55:49,826
It may be, very likely.

975
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:53,626
Hath there been such a time
I'd fain know that

976
00:55:53,626 --> 00:55:56,626
that I have positively said
'tis so,

977
00:55:56,626 --> 00:55:57,946
when it proved otherwise?

978
00:55:57,946 --> 00:55:59,546
Not that I know.

979
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:02,906
Take this from this,
if this be otherwise.

980
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:05,546
If circumstances lead me,
I will find

981
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:08,666
where truth is hid,
though it were hid indeed

982
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:09,946
within the centre.

983
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:12,346
How may we try this further?

984
00:56:12,346 --> 00:56:16,146
You know, sometimes he walks
four hours together

985
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:17,506
here in the lobby.

986
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:19,066
So he does indeed.

987
00:56:19,066 --> 00:56:22,306
At such a time
I'll loose my daughter to him.

988
00:56:22,306 --> 00:56:24,106
Be you and I behind an arras then,

989
00:56:24,106 --> 00:56:26,426
mark the encounter.
If he love her not

990
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:29,186
And be not
from his reason fallen thereon,

991
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:33,986
let me be no assistant for a state,
but keep a farm and carters.

992
00:56:33,986 --> 00:56:37,066
We will try it. But, look,
where sadly the poor wretch comes.

993
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:41,266
Sweet Gertrude, leave us.

994
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:44,626
Her father and myself,
lawful espials,

995
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:47,626
thus may of their encounter
frankly judge,

996
00:56:47,626 --> 00:56:49,626
if be the affliction
of his love or no

997
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:51,026
that thus he suffers for.

998
00:56:51,026 --> 00:56:52,866
I shall obey you.

999
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:57,226
And for your part, Ophelia,

1000
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:01,106
I do wish

1001
00:57:01,106 --> 00:57:03,546
that your good beauties
be the happy cause

1002
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:08,266
of Hamlet's wildness.
So shall I hope your virtues

1003
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:10,946
will bring him
to his wonted way again,

1004
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:12,546
to both your honours.

1005
00:57:12,546 --> 00:57:14,466
Madam, I wish it may.

1006
00:57:16,946 --> 00:57:20,226
Ophelia, walk you here.

1007
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:23,106
Read on this book,

1008
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:27,546
that show of such an exercise
may colour your loneliness.

1009
00:57:27,546 --> 00:57:30,506
I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my lord.

1010
00:57:46,306 --> 00:57:48,106
To be, or not to be,

1011
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,746
that is the question.

1012
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:03,746
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

1013
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:08,146
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

1014
00:58:08,146 --> 00:58:10,986
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,

1015
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:13,386
And by opposing end them?

1016
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:17,986
To die,

1017
00:58:19,506 --> 00:58:22,426
to sleep,

1018
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:23,906
no more,

1019
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,546
and by a sleep to say we end

1020
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:31,386
the heart-ache
and the thousand natural shocks

1021
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,266
that flesh is heir to.

1022
00:58:35,986 --> 00:58:38,026
'Tis a consummation...

1023
00:58:39,586 --> 00:58:42,386
..devoutly to be wish'd.

1024
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:44,626
To die,

1025
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,106
to sleep.

1026
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:53,866
To sleep, perchance to dream.

1027
00:58:53,866 --> 00:58:55,586
Ay, there's the rub.

1028
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:04,106
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come

1029
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:06,786
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil,

1030
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:08,786
must give us pause.

1031
00:59:11,306 --> 00:59:13,986
There's the respect

1032
00:59:13,986 --> 00:59:17,706
that makes calamity of so long life.

1033
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:28,666
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time,

1034
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,066
but that the dread of
something after death?

1035
00:59:33,786 --> 00:59:38,506
The undiscover'd country
from whose bourn

1036
00:59:38,506 --> 00:59:43,186
no traveller returns,
puzzles the will

1037
00:59:48,226 --> 00:59:51,426
and makes us rather
bear those ills we have

1038
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:54,786
than fly to others
that we know not of?

1039
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:02,586
Thus conscience
does make cowards of us all,

1040
01:00:06,026 --> 01:00:10,226
and thus
the native hue of resolution

1041
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:16,826
is sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought,

1042
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:23,066
and enterprises
of great pith and moment

1043
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:26,146
with this regard
their currents turn awry,

1044
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:32,506
and lose the name of action.
Soft you now!

1045
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:36,266
The fair Ophelia!

1046
01:00:38,226 --> 01:00:43,466
Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.

1047
01:00:43,466 --> 01:00:46,786
Good my lord, how does your honour
for this many a day?

1048
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:49,466
I humbly thank you -
well, well, well.

1049
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:52,746
My lord,
I have remembrances of yours

1050
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:56,066
that I have long-ed long
to re-deliver.

1051
01:00:56,066 --> 01:00:58,546
I pray you, now receive them.

1052
01:00:58,546 --> 01:01:01,426
Not I - I never gave you aught.

1053
01:01:01,426 --> 01:01:06,066
Mine honour'd lord,
you know right well you did,

1054
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:09,986
and, with them, words
of so sweet breath composed

1055
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:13,746
as made the things more rich.
Their perfume lost,

1056
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:16,826
take these again,
for to the noble mind

1057
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:20,346
rich gifts wax poor
when givers prove unkind.

1058
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:22,946
There, my lord.

1059
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:25,866
Are you honest?

1060
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:27,226
My lord?

1061
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:32,226
Are you fair?
What means your lordship?

1062
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,426
I did love you, once.

1063
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,826
Indeed, my lord,
you made me believe so.

1064
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:41,226
You should not have believed me,
I loved you not.

1065
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:43,546
I was the more deceived.

1066
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:46,866
Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst
thou be a breeder of sinners?

1067
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:48,506
I am myself indifferent honest,

1068
01:01:48,506 --> 01:01:51,706
and yet I could accuse me of such
things it were better my mother
had not borne me.

1069
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:55,066
What should such fellows as I do,
crawling between Earth and Heaven?

1070
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:57,666
We are arrant knaves, all -
believe none of us.

1071
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,946
Go thy ways to a nunnery.

1072
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:03,866
Where's your father?

1073
01:02:03,866 --> 01:02:05,826
At home, my lord.

1074
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:16,266
Let the door be shut upon him,

1075
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,866
that he may play the fool nowhere
but in his own house.

1076
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:21,746
Farewell.

1077
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:24,266
O, help him, you sweet Heavens!

1078
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:27,466
If thou dost marry, I'll give
you this plague for thy dowry -

1079
01:02:27,466 --> 01:02:30,826
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.

1080
01:02:30,826 --> 01:02:32,546
Get thee to a nunnery,
go, farewell.

1081
01:02:32,546 --> 01:02:34,986
Or, if thou wilt needs marry,
marry a fool,

1082
01:02:34,986 --> 01:02:38,186
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

1083
01:02:38,186 --> 01:02:40,866
To a nunnery, go, and quickly too.
Farewell.

1084
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:43,506
O Heavenly powers, restore him!

1085
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,146
You jig, you amble, and you lisp,

1086
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:49,986
and nick-name God's creatures, and
make your wantonness your ignorance.

1087
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:54,426
Go to, I'll no more on't,
it hath made me mad.

1088
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:58,146
I say,
we will have no more marriages.

1089
01:02:58,146 --> 01:03:02,466
Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live,

1090
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:04,946
the rest shall keep as they are.

1091
01:03:04,946 --> 01:03:06,746
To a nunnery, go.

1092
01:03:09,146 --> 01:03:11,506
O, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown!

1093
01:03:13,946 --> 01:03:16,106
The courtier's,

1094
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:18,226
soldier's,

1095
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:20,786
scholar's, eye,

1096
01:03:20,786 --> 01:03:23,626
tongue, sword.

1097
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:28,746
The expectancy and rose
of the fair state,

1098
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:33,506
the glass of fashion

1099
01:03:33,506 --> 01:03:36,666
and the mould of form,

1100
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,866
the observed of all observers,

1101
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:42,386
quite,

1102
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,626
quite down!

1103
01:03:45,746 --> 01:03:48,466
And I,

1104
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:52,826
of ladies most deject and wretched,

1105
01:03:52,826 --> 01:03:58,266
that suck'd the honey
of his music vows,

1106
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:02,026
now see that noble
and most sovereign reason,

1107
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:07,146
like sweet bells jangled,
out of tune and harsh.

1108
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:11,146
That unmatch'd form
and feature of blown youth

1109
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:13,586
blasted with ecstasy.

1110
01:04:19,306 --> 01:04:22,506
O, woe is me,

1111
01:04:22,506 --> 01:04:27,106
to have seen what I have seen,

1112
01:04:27,106 --> 01:04:29,906
see what I see!

1113
01:04:29,906 --> 01:04:33,466
'Love! His affections
do not that way tend.'

1114
01:04:33,466 --> 01:04:35,426
There's something in his soul,

1115
01:04:35,426 --> 01:04:38,746
o'er which his melancholy
sits on brood,

1116
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:41,386
and I do think the hatch
and the disclose

1117
01:04:41,386 --> 01:04:43,346
will be some danger.

1118
01:04:46,706 --> 01:04:48,626
How now, Ophelia!

1119
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:53,906
You need not tell us what
Lord Hamlet said, we heard it all.

1120
01:04:53,906 --> 01:04:56,906
Away, I do beseech you,
here he comes.

1121
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:58,506
I'll bore him presently.

1122
01:05:00,026 --> 01:05:02,946
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

1123
01:05:08,026 --> 01:05:09,746
Well...

1124
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:14,146
God a mercy.

1125
01:05:14,146 --> 01:05:17,186
Do you know me, my lord?

1126
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:19,746
Excellent well -
you are a fishmonger.

1127
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:23,266
Not I, my lord. Then I would
you were so honest a man.

1128
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:26,706
Honest, my lord! Ay, sir -
to be honest, as this world goes,

1129
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:29,146
is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.

1130
01:05:29,146 --> 01:05:31,106
That's very true, my lord.

1131
01:05:31,106 --> 01:05:33,386
For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog,

1132
01:05:33,386 --> 01:05:36,266
being a god kissing carrion...
Have you a daughter?

1133
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,866
I have, my lord.

1134
01:05:37,866 --> 01:05:40,426
Let her not walk in the sun.

1135
01:05:40,426 --> 01:05:44,146
Conception is a blessing, but
not as your daughter may conceive.

1136
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:50,426
Friend, look to 't.

1137
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:53,266
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter,

1138
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:58,386
yet he knew me not at first -
he said I was a fishmonger.

1139
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:01,266
He is far gone, far gone,

1140
01:06:01,266 --> 01:06:06,306
and truly in my youth
I suffered much extremity for love -

1141
01:06:06,306 --> 01:06:09,746
very near this.
I'll speak to him again.

1142
01:06:12,146 --> 01:06:15,106
What do you read, my lord?

1143
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:18,746
Words!

1144
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:22,266
Words, words?

1145
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:24,666
What is the matter, my lord?

1146
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,826
Between who?

1147
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:30,066
I mean,
the matter that you read, my lord.

1148
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:33,866
Slanders, sir,
for the satirical rogue says here

1149
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,906
that old men have grey beards...

1150
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:41,106
That their faces are wrinkled...

1151
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:46,866
Their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...

1152
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:50,586
and that they have a most plentiful
lack of wit...well...

1153
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:53,706
together with most weak hams.

1154
01:06:53,706 --> 01:06:57,346
All which, sir, though I most
powerfully and potently believe,

1155
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,066
yet I hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down.

1156
01:07:01,066 --> 01:07:03,906
For you yourself, sir,
should be as old as I am,

1157
01:07:03,906 --> 01:07:07,266
if like a crab
you could go backward.

1158
01:07:08,306 --> 01:07:11,706
Though this be madness,
yet there is method in 't.

1159
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:16,346
Will you walk out of the air,
my lord? Into my grave?

1160
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:20,586
Indeed, that is out o' the air.

1161
01:07:20,586 --> 01:07:23,186
How pregnant sometimes
his replies are!

1162
01:07:24,266 --> 01:07:29,546
My honourable lord, I will
most humbly take my leave of you.

1163
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,346
You cannot, sir,
take from me anything

1164
01:07:32,346 --> 01:07:35,106
that I would more
willingly part withal

1165
01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:37,866
except my life,

1166
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:41,266
except my life,

1167
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:46,706
except my life.

1168
01:07:50,226 --> 01:07:52,906
Fare you well, my lord.

1169
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:56,746
These tedious old fools!

1170
01:07:56,746 --> 01:08:00,266
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet -
there he is.

1171
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:02,786
God save you, sir!

1172
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:04,226
My honoured lord!

1173
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:06,226
My most dear lord!

1174
01:08:08,106 --> 01:08:13,506
My excellent good friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?

1175
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:17,026
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do ye both?

1176
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:20,546
As the indifferent children
of the earth.

1177
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:22,746
Happy, in that we are not over-happy.

1178
01:08:22,746 --> 01:08:25,466
On fortune's cap
we are not the very button.

1179
01:08:25,466 --> 01:08:28,266
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.

1180
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:30,706
Then you live about her waist,
or in the middle of her favours?

1181
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,826
Faith, her privates we.

1182
01:08:33,826 --> 01:08:37,226
In the secret parts of fortune?

1183
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:39,026
Most true, she is a strumpet.

1184
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:42,626
What's the news? None, my lord,

1185
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:45,026
but that the world's grown honest.

1186
01:08:45,026 --> 01:08:47,426
Then is doomsday near!

1187
01:08:47,426 --> 01:08:51,346
But your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular.

1188
01:08:51,346 --> 01:08:55,546
What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune,

1189
01:08:55,546 --> 01:08:57,906
that she sends you to prison hither?

1190
01:08:57,906 --> 01:09:00,626
Prison, my lord? Denmark's a prison.

1191
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:02,586
Then is the world one.

1192
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:06,026
A goodly one, in which there are
many confines, wards and dungeons,

1193
01:09:06,026 --> 01:09:08,906
Denmark being one o' the worst.

1194
01:09:08,906 --> 01:09:12,466
We think not so, my lord.

1195
01:09:12,466 --> 01:09:14,746
Why, then, 'tis none to you,

1196
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:19,706
for there is nothing either good
or bad, but thinking makes it so.

1197
01:09:19,706 --> 01:09:21,546
To me it's a prison.

1198
01:09:21,546 --> 01:09:26,666
Why then,
your ambition makes it one -

1199
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,066
'tis too narrow for your mind.

1200
01:09:29,066 --> 01:09:31,426
O God,

1201
01:09:31,426 --> 01:09:33,666
I could be bounded in a nut shell

1202
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,626
and count myself
a king of infinite space,

1203
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:41,626
were it not that I have bad dreams.

1204
01:09:43,786 --> 01:09:46,746
Shall we to the court?
We'll wait upon you.

1205
01:09:46,746 --> 01:09:48,306
No such matter.

1206
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:52,306
I will not sort you with
the rest of my servants.

1207
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:57,226
But, in the beaten way
of friendship,
what make you at Elsinore?

1208
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:01,506
To visit you, my lord, no other
occasion. Were you not sent for?

1209
01:10:04,106 --> 01:10:06,026
Is it your own inclining?

1210
01:10:08,106 --> 01:10:11,026
A free visitation?

1211
01:10:11,026 --> 01:10:13,506
Come, deal justly with me.

1212
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:16,546
Come, nay, speak!
What should we say, my lord?

1213
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,266
Why, anything, but to the purpose.

1214
01:10:18,266 --> 01:10:21,506
You were sent for, and there is
a kind of confession in your looks,

1215
01:10:21,506 --> 01:10:23,706
which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour.

1216
01:10:23,706 --> 01:10:25,346
I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.

1217
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,066
To what end, my lord?

1218
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:29,346
That you must teach me.

1219
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:32,066
But let me conjure you,
by the rights of our fellowship,

1220
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:35,706
be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?

1221
01:10:38,706 --> 01:10:42,506
What say you?
Nay, then, I have an eye of you.
If you love me, hold not off.

1222
01:10:44,066 --> 01:10:46,346
My lord, we were sent for.

1223
01:10:47,906 --> 01:10:49,506
I will tell you why.

1224
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:54,586
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery,

1225
01:10:56,186 --> 01:10:59,666
and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather.

1226
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:04,266
I have,

1227
01:11:04,266 --> 01:11:06,666
of late,

1228
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:09,626
but wherefore I know not,

1229
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:13,706
lost all my mirth,

1230
01:11:16,826 --> 01:11:20,026
forgone all custom of exercise.

1231
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:23,986
And indeed it goes
so heavily with my disposition

1232
01:11:23,986 --> 01:11:29,906
that this goodly frame, the Earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory,

1233
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:35,226
this most excellent canopy, the air,

1234
01:11:35,226 --> 01:11:39,666
look you,
this brave o'erhanging firmament,

1235
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:44,866
this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire,

1236
01:11:44,866 --> 01:11:48,026
why, it appears no other thing
to me

1237
01:11:48,026 --> 01:11:52,466
than a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapours.

1238
01:11:56,706 --> 01:11:59,586
What a piece of work is a man!

1239
01:12:02,186 --> 01:12:05,426
How noble in reason!

1240
01:12:05,426 --> 01:12:07,466
How infinite in faculty!

1241
01:12:09,066 --> 01:12:12,626
In form and moving,
how express and admirable!

1242
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:16,386
In action, how like an angel!

1243
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:21,066
In apprehension, how like a god!

1244
01:12:23,466 --> 01:12:26,586
The beauty of the world!

1245
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:29,066
The paragon of animals!

1246
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:31,506
And yet, to me, what is this...

1247
01:12:34,026 --> 01:12:36,186
..quintessence of dust?

1248
01:12:39,226 --> 01:12:42,866
Man delights not me.

1249
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:45,506
Uh-huh.

1250
01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:48,746
No, nor woman neither, though by
your smiling you seem to say so.

1251
01:12:48,746 --> 01:12:50,746
My lord, there was
no such stuff in my thoughts.

1252
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:53,826
Why did you laugh then,
when I said man delights not me?

1253
01:12:53,826 --> 01:12:56,466
To think, my lord,
if you delight not in man,

1254
01:12:56,466 --> 01:13:01,106
what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive from you.

1255
01:13:01,106 --> 01:13:02,866
We coted them on the way,

1256
01:13:02,866 --> 01:13:05,666
and hither are they coming, to offer
you service. What players are they?

1257
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:10,226
Even those you were wont
to take delight in,
the tragedians of the city.

1258
01:13:10,226 --> 01:13:12,506
He that plays the king
shall be welcome.

1259
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:16,626
His Majesty
shall have tribute of me.

1260
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:21,386
It is not very strange,
for mine uncle is king of Denmark,

1261
01:13:21,386 --> 01:13:24,706
and there are those that would make
mows at him while my father lived,

1262
01:13:24,706 --> 01:13:27,826
who'd give twenty, forty,
fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece

1263
01:13:27,826 --> 01:13:29,346
for his picture in little.

1264
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:33,866
'Sblood, there is something
in this more than natural,
if philosophy could find it out.

1265
01:13:33,866 --> 01:13:37,946
CAR HORN
There are the players. Gentlemen,
you are welcome to Elsinore.

1266
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,346
Come then, your hands.

1267
01:13:40,346 --> 01:13:45,586
My uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.

1268
01:13:45,586 --> 01:13:47,146
In what, my dear lord?

1269
01:13:47,146 --> 01:13:50,426
I am but mad north-north-west.

1270
01:13:52,306 --> 01:13:57,626
When the wind is southerly,
I know an 'awk from an 'andsaw.

1271
01:13:57,626 --> 01:13:59,386
Well, be with you, gentlemen!

1272
01:13:59,386 --> 01:14:02,506
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too.
At each ear a hearer -

1273
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:07,386
That great baby you see there is
not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.

1274
01:14:07,386 --> 01:14:11,266
Happily he's the second time
come to them, for they say
an old man is twice a child.

1275
01:14:11,266 --> 01:14:14,546
I will prophesy he comes to
tell me of the players - mark it.

1276
01:14:14,546 --> 01:14:17,146
You say right, sir -
Monday morning, 'twas so indeed.

1277
01:14:17,146 --> 01:14:18,666
My lord, I have news to tell you.

1278
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,786
My lord, I have news to tell you!

1279
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:24,306
When Roscius was an actor in Rome...
The actors are come hither, my lord.

1280
01:14:24,306 --> 01:14:28,426
Buzz, buzz! Upon mine honour...
Then came each actor on his arse.

1281
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:33,266
The best actors in the world,
either for tragedy, comedy, history,

1282
01:14:33,266 --> 01:14:37,746
pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral,

1283
01:14:37,746 --> 01:14:42,546
tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,

1284
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:45,386
scene individable, or poem unlimited.

1285
01:14:45,386 --> 01:14:48,826
Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor Plautus too light.

1286
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:52,666
O Jephthah, judge of Israel,
what a treasure hadst thou!

1287
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:54,706
What a treasure had he, my lord?

1288
01:14:54,706 --> 01:14:57,706
Why, "One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well."

1289
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:01,186
Still on my daughter.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

1290
01:15:01,186 --> 01:15:05,586
If you call me Jephthah, my lord,
I have a daughter
that I love passing well.

1291
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:07,386
Nay, that follows not.

1292
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:11,466
What follows, then, my lord? You are
welcome, masters, welcome, all.

1293
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:14,626
I am glad to see thee well.
Welcome, good friends.

1294
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,106
O, my old friend!

1295
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:22,186
What, my young lady and mistress!
By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer
to Heaven than when I last saw you.

1296
01:15:22,186 --> 01:15:25,626
Pray God, your voice be not
cracked within the ring.
We'll have a speech straight.

1297
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:29,426
Come, give us a taste of your
quality - come, a passionate speech.

1298
01:15:29,426 --> 01:15:31,026
What speech, my lord?

1299
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:34,026
I heard thee speak me a speech once,
but it was never acted,

1300
01:15:34,026 --> 01:15:37,546
or, if it was, not above once,
for the play, I remember,
pleased not the million.

1301
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:39,546
'Twas caviare to the general.

1302
01:15:39,546 --> 01:15:43,386
One speech in it I chiefly
loved 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido,

1303
01:15:43,386 --> 01:15:46,666
and thereabout of it especially,
where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter.

1304
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:49,386
If it live in your memory,
begin at this line.

1305
01:15:49,386 --> 01:15:51,466
Let me see, let me see.

1306
01:15:51,466 --> 01:15:55,306
"The rugged Pyrrhus, like the
Hyrcanian beast," - it is not so.

1307
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:58,666
It begins with Pyrrhus,
"The rugged Pyrrhus..."

1308
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:01,186
He whose sable arms...
"..whose sable arms"!

1309
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:06,346
Er, "black as his purpose
did the night resemble.

1310
01:16:06,346 --> 01:16:10,226
"When he lay couch-ed
in the ominous horse,

1311
01:16:10,226 --> 01:16:14,266
"hath now this dread
and black complexion smear'd

1312
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:17,426
"With heraldry more dismal,
head to foot.

1313
01:16:17,426 --> 01:16:21,706
"Now is he..." Total...

1314
01:16:21,706 --> 01:16:24,946
"total gules, roasted in wrath,

1315
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:29,226
"And thus o'er-sized
with coagulate gore,

1316
01:16:29,226 --> 01:16:34,746
"with eyes like carbuncles,
the hellish Pyrrhus..."

1317
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:38,346
Pyrrhus...

1318
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:42,706
"Old grandsire Priam seeks."

1319
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:44,026
So, proceed you.

1320
01:16:44,026 --> 01:16:48,906
Fore God, my lord, well spoken,
with good accent and good discretion.

1321
01:16:48,906 --> 01:16:50,506
Ssssh!

1322
01:16:52,426 --> 01:16:55,746
Anon he finds him,

1323
01:16:55,746 --> 01:16:59,346
striking too short at Greeks,
his antique sword,

1324
01:16:59,346 --> 01:17:02,386
rebellious to his arm,
lies where it falls,

1325
01:17:02,386 --> 01:17:06,626
repugnant to command.
Unequal match'd,

1326
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:11,386
Pyrrhus at Priam drives,
in rage strikes wide,

1327
01:17:11,386 --> 01:17:16,306
but with the whiff and wind
of his fell sword

1328
01:17:16,306 --> 01:17:19,626
his unnerv-ed father falls.

1329
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:22,946
Then senseless Ilium,

1330
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:26,546
Seeming to feel this blow,
with flaming top

1331
01:17:26,546 --> 01:17:29,626
stoops to his base,
and with a hideous crash

1332
01:17:29,626 --> 01:17:34,106
takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear
for, lo! his sword,

1333
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:36,386
which was declining
on the milky head

1334
01:17:36,386 --> 01:17:40,746
of Reverend Priam,
seem'd in the air to stick.

1335
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:49,186
So, as a painted tyrant,
Pyrrhus stood,

1336
01:17:49,186 --> 01:17:52,426
And like a neutral to
his will and matter,

1337
01:17:53,986 --> 01:17:56,306
did nothing.

1338
01:17:56,306 --> 01:18:00,426
But, as we often see,
against some storm,

1339
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,586
a silence in the Heavens,
the rack stand still,

1340
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:07,426
the bold winds speechless
and the orb below

1341
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:09,906
as hush as death.

1342
01:18:09,906 --> 01:18:13,826
Anon the dreadful thunder

1343
01:18:13,826 --> 01:18:19,346
doth rend the region,
so, after Pyrrhus' pause,

1344
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:22,306
arous-ed vengeance
sets him new a-work.

1345
01:18:22,306 --> 01:18:25,386
And never did
the Cyclops' hammers fall

1346
01:18:25,386 --> 01:18:29,346
on Mars, his armours
forged for proof eterne

1347
01:18:29,346 --> 01:18:32,786
with less remorse
than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword

1348
01:18:32,786 --> 01:18:34,906
now falls on Priam.

1349
01:18:34,906 --> 01:18:36,826
This is too long.

1350
01:18:36,826 --> 01:18:39,826
It shall to the barber's,
with your beard. Prithee, say on.

1351
01:18:39,826 --> 01:18:42,386
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry,
or he sleeps.

1352
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:45,066
Say on, come to Hecuba.

1353
01:18:47,466 --> 01:18:49,266
But who,

1354
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,186
O,

1355
01:18:51,186 --> 01:18:53,746
who had seen the mobled queen?

1356
01:18:53,746 --> 01:18:57,386
The mobled queen?
That's good, "mobled queen" is good.

1357
01:18:57,386 --> 01:18:59,386
Sshh!

1358
01:19:00,546 --> 01:19:07,466
Run barefoot up and down,
threatening the flames

1359
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:11,066
with bisson rheum,
a clout about that head

1360
01:19:11,066 --> 01:19:14,266
where late the diadem stood.

1361
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:20,346
And for a robe, about her lank
and all o'er-teemed loins,

1362
01:19:20,346 --> 01:19:24,786
A blanket,
in the alarm of fear caught up.

1363
01:19:24,786 --> 01:19:27,746
Who this had seen,
with tongue in venom steep'd,

1364
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:31,226
'gainst Fortune's state
would treason have pronounced.

1365
01:19:33,106 --> 01:19:36,626
But if the gods themselves
did see her then

1366
01:19:36,626 --> 01:19:40,746
when she saw Pyrrhus
make malicious sport

1367
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:44,466
in mincing with his sword
her husband's limbs,

1368
01:19:46,026 --> 01:19:49,946
the instant burst
of clamour that she made,

1369
01:19:51,546 --> 01:19:55,746
unless things mortal
move them not at all,

1370
01:19:55,746 --> 01:19:59,866
would have made milch
the burning eyes of heaven...

1371
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:05,666
..and passion in the gods.

1372
01:20:08,146 --> 01:20:13,506
Look, where he has not turned
his colour and has tears in's eyes.

1373
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:15,066
Pray you, no more.

1374
01:20:15,066 --> 01:20:17,466
'Tis well.

1375
01:20:17,466 --> 01:20:19,386
I'll have thee speak out
the rest soon.

1376
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:22,106
APPLAUSE

1377
01:20:22,106 --> 01:20:24,466
Good my lord, will you see
the players well bestowed?

1378
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:25,986
Do you hear, let them be well used,

1379
01:20:25,986 --> 01:20:28,706
for they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.

1380
01:20:28,706 --> 01:20:32,266
My lord, I will use them
according to their desert.

1381
01:20:32,266 --> 01:20:35,266
God's bodykins, man, much better!

1382
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:39,586
Use every man after his desert,
and who should 'scape whipping?

1383
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:42,266
Come, sirs. Follow him, friends.

1384
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:44,266
We'll hear a play tomorrow.

1385
01:20:44,266 --> 01:20:46,186
Dost thou hear me, old friend?

1386
01:20:46,186 --> 01:20:48,826
Can you play the Murder of Gonzago?

1387
01:20:48,826 --> 01:20:50,546
Ay, my lord.
We'll ha't tomorrow night.

1388
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:54,946
You could, for a need,
study a speech
of some dozen or sixteen lines,

1389
01:20:54,946 --> 01:20:57,466
which I would set down
and insert in't, could you not?

1390
01:20:57,466 --> 01:20:59,506
Ay, my lord. Very well.

1391
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:03,546
Follow that lord,
and pray you, mock him not.

1392
01:21:03,546 --> 01:21:05,706
Er...no.

1393
01:21:08,706 --> 01:21:11,386
My good friends,
I'll leave you till night.

1394
01:21:12,946 --> 01:21:14,666
You are welcome to Elsinore.

1395
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,706
Good my lord!

1396
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:22,266
Ay, so, God be wi' ye.

1397
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,266
Now I am alone.

1398
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:54,026
O, what a rogue and peasant slave
am I!

1399
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:02,066
Is it not monstrous
that this player here,

1400
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:06,786
but in a fiction,

1401
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:09,866
in a dream of passion,

1402
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:15,746
could force his soul
so to his own conceit

1403
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:18,586
that from her workings
all his visage wann'd,

1404
01:22:21,346 --> 01:22:26,106
tears in his eyes,
distraction in his aspect,

1405
01:22:26,106 --> 01:22:28,906
a broken voice,
and his whole function suiting

1406
01:22:28,906 --> 01:22:31,266
with forms to his conceit?

1407
01:22:34,426 --> 01:22:37,106
And all for nothing!

1408
01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:38,586
For Hecuba!

1409
01:22:42,266 --> 01:22:45,186
What's Hecuba to him,
or he to Hecuba,

1410
01:22:45,186 --> 01:22:47,226
that he should weep for her?

1411
01:22:50,346 --> 01:22:52,386
What would he do,

1412
01:22:52,386 --> 01:22:55,466
had he the motive
and the cue for passion

1413
01:22:55,466 --> 01:23:00,466
that I have?
He would drown the stage in tears

1414
01:23:00,466 --> 01:23:03,546
and cleave the general ear
with horrid speech,

1415
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:07,586
make mad the guilty
and appal the free,

1416
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:11,506
confound the ignorant,
and amaze indeed

1417
01:23:11,506 --> 01:23:15,466
the very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet I,

1418
01:23:18,346 --> 01:23:21,746
a dull and muddy-mettled rascal,
peak,

1419
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,306
like John a'dreams,

1420
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:29,746
unpregnant of my cause,
and can say nothing.

1421
01:23:29,746 --> 01:23:32,746
No, not for a king,

1422
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:37,346
upon whose property
and most dear life

1423
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,746
a damn'd defeat was made.

1424
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:51,706
Am I a coward?

1425
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:56,906
Who calls me villain?

1426
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:59,466
Breaks my pate across?

1427
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:02,546
Plucks off my beard,
and blows it in my face?

1428
01:24:02,546 --> 01:24:04,186
Tweaks me by the nose?

1429
01:24:04,186 --> 01:24:08,866
Gives me the lie i' the throat,
as deep as to the lungs?
Who does me this? Ha!

1430
01:24:08,866 --> 01:24:12,546
'Swounds, I should take it,
for it cannot be

1431
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:16,266
but I am pigeon-liver'd
and lack gall

1432
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:19,386
to make oppression bitter,
or ere this

1433
01:24:19,386 --> 01:24:22,786
I should have fatted
all the region kites

1434
01:24:22,786 --> 01:24:25,546
with this slave's offal.

1435
01:24:25,546 --> 01:24:28,946
Bloody, bawdy villain!

1436
01:24:28,946 --> 01:24:33,066
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!

1437
01:24:33,066 --> 01:24:35,586
O, vengeance!

1438
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:40,626
Why, what an ass am I!

1439
01:24:42,466 --> 01:24:44,506
This is most brave,

1440
01:24:47,826 --> 01:24:52,106
that I, the son of a dear father,

1441
01:24:52,106 --> 01:24:54,186
murder'd,

1442
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:59,426
prompted to my revenge
by Heaven and Hell,

1443
01:24:59,426 --> 01:25:03,066
must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words,

1444
01:25:03,066 --> 01:25:06,586
and fall a-cursing,
like a very drab,

1445
01:25:06,586 --> 01:25:10,266
a scullion! Fie upon't! Foh!

1446
01:25:10,266 --> 01:25:11,986
About, my brain!

1447
01:25:15,906 --> 01:25:17,946
I have heard

1448
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:21,946
that guilty creatures
sitting at a play

1449
01:25:21,946 --> 01:25:24,506
have by the very cunning
of the scene

1450
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:26,786
been struck so to the soul
that presently

1451
01:25:26,786 --> 01:25:29,986
they have proclaim'd
their malefactions.

1452
01:25:29,986 --> 01:25:33,426
For murder, though it
have no tongue, will speak

1453
01:25:33,426 --> 01:25:35,786
with most miraculous organ.

1454
01:25:37,386 --> 01:25:39,026
I'll have these players

1455
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:41,706
play something like the murder
of my father

1456
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:43,386
before mine uncle.

1457
01:25:43,386 --> 01:25:47,586
I'll observe his looks,
I'll tent him to the quick.

1458
01:25:47,586 --> 01:25:50,586
If he but blench,

1459
01:25:50,586 --> 01:25:52,106
I know my course.

1460
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:57,426
The spirit that I have seen

1461
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:00,266
may be a devil
and the devil hath power

1462
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:02,626
to assume a pleasing shape.
Yea, and perhaps

1463
01:26:02,626 --> 01:26:04,586
out of my weakness
and my melancholy,

1464
01:26:04,586 --> 01:26:08,386
as he is very potent with such
spirits, abuses me to damn me.

1465
01:26:08,386 --> 01:26:13,706
I'll have grounds
More relative than this.

1466
01:26:13,706 --> 01:26:15,666
The play's the thing

1467
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:19,066
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.

1468
01:26:19,066 --> 01:26:21,506
And can you,
by no drift of conference,

1469
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:24,146
get from him
why he puts on this confusion?

1470
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:27,466
He does confess
he feels himself distracted,

1471
01:26:27,466 --> 01:26:30,746
but from what cause
he will by no means speak.

1472
01:26:30,746 --> 01:26:32,626
Nor do we find him forward
to be sounded,

1473
01:26:32,626 --> 01:26:34,826
but, with a crafty madness,
keeps aloof,

1474
01:26:34,826 --> 01:26:38,186
when we would bring him on to some
confession of his true state.

1475
01:26:38,186 --> 01:26:39,706
Did he receive you well?

1476
01:26:39,706 --> 01:26:42,786
Most like a gentleman. But with
much forcing of his disposition.

1477
01:26:42,786 --> 01:26:45,826
Niggard of question, but, of our
demands, most free in his reply.

1478
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:48,706
Did you assay him? To any pastime?

1479
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:51,226
Madam, it so fell out,
that certain players

1480
01:26:51,226 --> 01:26:53,986
we o'er-raught on the way,
of these we told him,

1481
01:26:53,986 --> 01:26:57,586
and there did seem in him a kind of
joy to hear of it. 'Tis most true.

1482
01:26:57,586 --> 01:27:01,746
And he beseech'd me
to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter.

1483
01:27:01,746 --> 01:27:04,946
With all my heart,
and it doth much content me

1484
01:27:04,946 --> 01:27:06,866
to hear him thus inclined.

1485
01:27:06,866 --> 01:27:12,026
Good gentlemen,
give him a further edge, and drive
his purpose on to these delights.

1486
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,546
We shall, my lord.

1487
01:27:16,746 --> 01:27:19,346
I have in quick determination
thus set it down.

1488
01:27:19,346 --> 01:27:21,946
He shall with speed to England.

1489
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:24,346
Haply the seas
and countries different

1490
01:27:24,346 --> 01:27:26,626
with variable objects will expel

1491
01:27:26,626 --> 01:27:29,626
This something-settled matter
in his heart,

1492
01:27:29,626 --> 01:27:32,706
whereon his brains still beating
puts him thus

1493
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,826
from fashion of himself.
What think you on't?

1494
01:27:34,826 --> 01:27:38,186
It shall do well,
but yet do I believe

1495
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,546
The origin and commencement
of his grief

1496
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,186
sprung from neglected love.

1497
01:27:42,186 --> 01:27:44,546
My lord, do as you please,

1498
01:27:44,546 --> 01:27:48,066
but, if you hold it fit,
after the play

1499
01:27:48,066 --> 01:27:51,306
let his queen mother all alone
entreat him

1500
01:27:51,306 --> 01:27:54,266
to show his grief.
Let her be round with him,

1501
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:58,066
and I'll be placed, so please you,
in the ear

1502
01:27:58,066 --> 01:28:01,466
Of all their conference.
If she find him not,

1503
01:28:01,466 --> 01:28:04,066
to England send him,
or confine him where

1504
01:28:04,066 --> 01:28:05,946
your wisdom best shall think.

1505
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:08,146
It shall be so.

1506
01:28:08,146 --> 01:28:12,826
Madness in great ones
must not unwatch'd go.

1507
01:28:14,826 --> 01:28:18,226
Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue,

1508
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,746
but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do,

1509
01:28:20,746 --> 01:28:23,786
I had as lief the town-crier
spoke my lines.

1510
01:28:23,786 --> 01:28:29,146
Nor do not saw the air too much
with your hands, thus,

1511
01:28:29,146 --> 01:28:34,746
but use all gently,
for in the very torrent, tempest,

1512
01:28:34,746 --> 01:28:37,426
and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion,

1513
01:28:37,426 --> 01:28:39,546
you must acquire and beget
a temperance

1514
01:28:39,546 --> 01:28:41,386
that may give it smoothness.

1515
01:28:41,386 --> 01:28:47,506
O, it offends me to the soul to
hear a robustious periwig-pated
fellow tear a passion to tatters,

1516
01:28:47,506 --> 01:28:50,186
to very rags, to split the ears of
the groundlings,

1517
01:28:50,186 --> 01:28:55,186
who for the most part
are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise.

1518
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:57,786
I would have such a fellow whipped
for o'erdoing Termagant.

1519
01:28:57,786 --> 01:29:00,746
It out-Herods Herod.
Pray you, avoid it.

1520
01:29:00,746 --> 01:29:02,386
I warrant your honour.

1521
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:06,386
Be not too tame neither,

1522
01:29:06,386 --> 01:29:08,666
but let your own discretion
be your tutor.

1523
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:12,786
Suit the action to the word,
the word to the action.

1524
01:29:12,786 --> 01:29:14,866
With this special observance,

1525
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:17,226
that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature.

1526
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:21,826
For any thing so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end,

1527
01:29:21,826 --> 01:29:27,626
both at the first and last,
was and is, to hold, as 'twere,
the mirror up to nature,

1528
01:29:29,426 --> 01:29:32,666
to show virtue her own feature,

1529
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:35,346
scorn her own image,

1530
01:29:35,346 --> 01:29:38,746
and the very age
and body of the time

1531
01:29:38,746 --> 01:29:40,946
is form and pressure.

1532
01:29:40,946 --> 01:29:43,146
Now this overdone,
or come tardy off,

1533
01:29:43,146 --> 01:29:45,146
though it make
the unskilful laugh,

1534
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:47,906
cannot but make
the judicious grieve,

1535
01:29:47,906 --> 01:29:52,426
the censure of the which
one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.

1536
01:29:52,426 --> 01:29:56,826
I hope we have reformed that
indifferently with us, sir.

1537
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:58,346
O, reform it altogether.

1538
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:02,426
And let those that play your clowns

1539
01:30:02,426 --> 01:30:04,986
speak no more than
is set down for them,

1540
01:30:04,986 --> 01:30:07,946
for there be of them
that will themselves laugh,

1541
01:30:07,946 --> 01:30:11,426
to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too,

1542
01:30:11,426 --> 01:30:14,746
though, in the mean time,
some necessary question of
the play be then to be considered.

1543
01:30:14,746 --> 01:30:19,346
That's villanous,
and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it.

1544
01:30:19,346 --> 01:30:22,786
Go, make you ready.
How now, my lord!

1545
01:30:22,786 --> 01:30:25,106
Will the king
hear this piece of work?

1546
01:30:25,106 --> 01:30:28,226
And the queen too,
and that presently.

1547
01:30:28,226 --> 01:30:30,666
Bid the players make haste.

1548
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:32,786
Da!

1549
01:30:32,786 --> 01:30:35,146
Will you two help to hasten them?

1550
01:30:35,146 --> 01:30:37,586
We will, my lord.

1551
01:30:47,346 --> 01:30:50,386
What ho! Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.

1552
01:30:50,386 --> 01:30:55,506
Horatio, thou art e'en as just
a man as e'er my conversation
coped withal. O, my dear lord.

1553
01:30:55,506 --> 01:30:57,626
Nay, do not think I flatter.
Dost thou hear?

1554
01:30:57,626 --> 01:30:59,746
Since my dear soul
was mistress of her choice

1555
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,946
and could of men distinguish,
her election

1556
01:31:01,946 --> 01:31:05,186
hath seal'd thee for herself.
Give me that man

1557
01:31:05,186 --> 01:31:08,546
that is not passion's slave,
and I will wear him

1558
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:12,986
in my heart's core,
ay, in my heart of heart,

1559
01:31:12,986 --> 01:31:15,506
as I do thee.
Something too much of this.

1560
01:31:15,506 --> 01:31:19,746
There is a play tonight
before the king.

1561
01:31:19,746 --> 01:31:24,306
One scene of it comes near the
circumstance which I have told
thee of my father's death.

1562
01:31:24,306 --> 01:31:26,906
I prithee,
when thou seest that act afoot,

1563
01:31:26,906 --> 01:31:29,186
even with the very comment
of thy soul,

1564
01:31:29,186 --> 01:31:32,386
observe mine uncle.
If his occulted guilt

1565
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:34,466
do not itself unkennel
in one speech,

1566
01:31:36,066 --> 01:31:38,746
it is a damned ghost
that we have seen,

1567
01:31:38,746 --> 01:31:42,386
and my imaginations are as foul as
Vulcan's smithy.

1568
01:31:42,386 --> 01:31:45,746
Well, my lord, if he steal aught
the whilst this play is playing,

1569
01:31:45,746 --> 01:31:47,906
and 'scape detecting,
I will pay the theft.
MUSIC STARTS

1570
01:31:47,906 --> 01:31:49,666
They are coming to the play.

1571
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:51,586
I must be idle. Get you a place.

1572
01:32:01,626 --> 01:32:04,746
HAMLET WHISTLES ALONG TO MUSIC

1573
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,866
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

1574
01:32:25,866 --> 01:32:31,466
Excellent, i' faith,
of the chameleon's dish
I eat the air, promise-crammed.

1575
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:35,346
I have nothing with this answer,
Hamlet, these words are not mine.

1576
01:32:35,346 --> 01:32:40,306
No, nor mine now.
My lord, you played once
i' the university, you say?

1577
01:32:40,306 --> 01:32:45,306
That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.

1578
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:46,866
What did you enact?

1579
01:32:46,866 --> 01:32:50,306
I did enact Julius Caesar.

1580
01:32:50,306 --> 01:32:53,106
I was killed i' the Capitol.

1581
01:32:53,106 --> 01:32:55,226
Brutus killed me.

1582
01:32:55,226 --> 01:32:59,746
It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

1583
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:02,426
Be the players ready? Ay, my lord,
they stay upon your patience.

1584
01:33:02,426 --> 01:33:05,026
Come hither, my dear Hamlet,
sit by me.

1585
01:33:05,026 --> 01:33:07,066
No, good mother,

1586
01:33:07,066 --> 01:33:09,466
here's metal more attractive.

1587
01:33:09,466 --> 01:33:11,946
O, ho! Do you mark that?

1588
01:33:11,946 --> 01:33:14,026
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

1589
01:33:14,026 --> 01:33:16,626
No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?

1590
01:33:16,626 --> 01:33:20,466
Ay, my lord. Do you think I meant
country matters?

1591
01:33:20,466 --> 01:33:22,106
I think nothing, my lord.

1592
01:33:22,106 --> 01:33:25,466
That's a fair thought.
To lie between maids' legs.

1593
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:28,666
What is, my lord? Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.

1594
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:30,266
Who, I? Ay, my lord.

1595
01:33:30,266 --> 01:33:33,746
O God, your only jig-maker.
What should a man do but be merry?

1596
01:33:33,746 --> 01:33:37,226
For, look,
how cheerfully my mother looks,

1597
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:40,026
and my father died these two hours.

1598
01:33:40,026 --> 01:33:44,066
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

1599
01:33:44,066 --> 01:33:48,266
So long?
Nay then, let the devil wear black,
for I'll have a suit of sables.

1600
01:33:48,266 --> 01:33:50,106
O heavens!

1601
01:33:50,106 --> 01:33:52,746
Die two months ago,
and not forgotten yet?

1602
01:33:52,746 --> 01:33:57,386
PLAYERS GIBBER

1603
01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:04,266
Dead!

1604
01:35:27,426 --> 01:35:29,626
APPLAUSE

1605
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:56,506
What means this, my lord?

1606
01:35:56,506 --> 01:35:59,506
Marry, this is miching mallecho.
It means mischief.

1607
01:35:59,506 --> 01:36:03,106
Belike this show
imports the argument of the play.

1608
01:36:03,106 --> 01:36:07,706
We shall know by this fellow -
the players cannot keep counsel.
They'll tell all.

1609
01:36:07,706 --> 01:36:11,466
For us, and for our tragedy,

1610
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:17,906
Here stooping to your clemency,
we beg your hearing patiently.

1611
01:36:19,226 --> 01:36:21,626
Is this a prologue,
or the posy of a ring?

1612
01:36:21,626 --> 01:36:23,386
Tis brief, my lord.

1613
01:36:23,386 --> 01:36:25,986
As woman's love.

1614
01:36:25,986 --> 01:36:28,346
MUSIC STARTS

1615
01:36:49,466 --> 01:36:53,866
Full 30 years hath
passed in sacred banns

1616
01:36:53,866 --> 01:37:00,386
since love our hearts
and Hymen joined our hands.

1617
01:37:00,386 --> 01:37:03,826
So many journeys
may the sun and moon

1618
01:37:03,826 --> 01:37:07,506
make us again count o'er
ere love be done!

1619
01:37:09,626 --> 01:37:15,626
Faith, I must leave thee, love,
and shortly too.

1620
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:21,026
My operant powers
their functions leave to do.

1621
01:37:21,026 --> 01:37:24,946
And thou shalt live
in this fair world behind,

1622
01:37:26,626 --> 01:37:32,026
honour'd, beloved,
and haply one as kind

1623
01:37:32,026 --> 01:37:34,466
for husband shalt thou.

1624
01:37:34,466 --> 01:37:36,586
O, confound the rest!

1625
01:37:36,586 --> 01:37:40,466
Such love must needs
be treason in my breast.

1626
01:37:42,026 --> 01:37:45,226
In second husband let me be accurst!

1627
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:47,986
None wed the second
but who kill'd the first.

1628
01:37:50,466 --> 01:37:53,706
A second time
I kill my husband dead,

1629
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:57,066
when second husband
kisses me in bed.

1630
01:37:57,066 --> 01:38:00,666
I do believe you think
what now you speak

1631
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:04,746
but what we do determine
oft we break.

1632
01:38:04,746 --> 01:38:08,346
So think thou wilt
no second husband wed,

1633
01:38:08,346 --> 01:38:16,306
but die thy thoughts
when thy first lord is dead.

1634
01:38:16,306 --> 01:38:21,226
Nor Earth to me give food,
nor heaven light!

1635
01:38:21,226 --> 01:38:25,346
Sport and repose
lock from me day and night!

1636
01:38:25,346 --> 01:38:30,506
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife,

1637
01:38:30,506 --> 01:38:34,386
if, once a widow, ever I be wife!

1638
01:38:34,386 --> 01:38:36,266
If she should break it now!

1639
01:38:36,266 --> 01:38:39,666
'Tis deeply sworn.

1640
01:38:40,866 --> 01:38:44,746
Sweet, leave me here awhile.

1641
01:38:44,746 --> 01:38:48,986
My spirits grow dull,
and fain I would beguile

1642
01:38:48,986 --> 01:38:52,666
the tedious day with sleep.

1643
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:56,146
Sleep rock thy brain,

1644
01:38:56,146 --> 01:38:59,626
and never come mischance
between us twain!

1645
01:38:59,626 --> 01:39:02,706
Madam, how like you this play?

1646
01:39:02,706 --> 01:39:06,066
The lady doth protest too much,
methinks.

1647
01:39:06,066 --> 01:39:07,706
LAUGHTER

1648
01:39:07,706 --> 01:39:11,026
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument?

1649
01:39:11,026 --> 01:39:14,346
Is there no offence in't? No, no,
they do but jest, poison in jest.

1650
01:39:14,346 --> 01:39:15,946
No offence i' the world.

1651
01:39:15,946 --> 01:39:17,786
What do you call the play?

1652
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:19,386
The Mouse-trap.

1653
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:21,426
The play is the image of
a murder done in Vienna.

1654
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:23,626
Gonzago is the duke's name,
his wife, Baptista.

1655
01:39:23,626 --> 01:39:26,106
You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish
piece of work, but what o' that?

1656
01:39:26,106 --> 01:39:30,426
Your majesty and we that have
free souls, it touches us not.

1657
01:39:30,426 --> 01:39:34,546
Let the gall-ed jade wince,
our withers are unwrung.

1658
01:39:34,546 --> 01:39:37,746
Ah, this is one Lucianus,
nephew to the king.

1659
01:39:37,746 --> 01:39:39,826
You are as good as a chorus,
my lord.

1660
01:39:39,826 --> 01:39:42,866
I could interpret between you
and your love, if I could
see the puppets dallying.

1661
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:45,786
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

1662
01:39:47,946 --> 01:39:51,546
Begin, murderer.

1663
01:39:51,546 --> 01:39:54,426
Pox, leave thy damnable faces,
and begin.

1664
01:39:54,426 --> 01:39:57,746
Come, the croaking raven
doth bellow for revenge.

1665
01:39:57,746 --> 01:40:00,226
Thoughts black,

1666
01:40:00,226 --> 01:40:05,826
hands apt, drugs fit,
and time agreeing.

1667
01:40:05,826 --> 01:40:11,346
Confederate season,
else no creature seeing.

1668
01:40:11,346 --> 01:40:15,626
Thou mixture rank,
of midnight weeds collected,

1669
01:40:15,626 --> 01:40:21,546
with Hecate's ban
thrice blasted, thrice infected.

1670
01:40:23,146 --> 01:40:27,106
Thy natural magic
and dire property,

1671
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:32,346
on wholesome life usurp immediately.

1672
01:40:32,346 --> 01:40:34,146
He poisons him
in the garden for his estate.

1673
01:40:34,146 --> 01:40:37,506
His name's Gonzago. The play is
extant, and writ in choice Italian.

1674
01:40:37,506 --> 01:40:41,306
You shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

1675
01:40:42,506 --> 01:40:45,226
The king rises.
What, frighted with false fire?

1676
01:40:45,226 --> 01:40:47,546
How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play.

1677
01:40:49,946 --> 01:40:51,906
Give me some light.

1678
01:41:02,106 --> 01:41:04,426
Away! Lights, lights, lights!

1679
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:18,746
O good Horatio, I'll take the
ghost's word for a thousand pound.

1680
01:41:18,746 --> 01:41:20,946
Didst perceive? Very well, my lord.

1681
01:41:20,946 --> 01:41:23,066
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

1682
01:41:23,066 --> 01:41:25,346
I did very well note him.
Come, some music!

1683
01:41:25,346 --> 01:41:27,106
Come, the recorder!

1684
01:41:27,106 --> 01:41:29,706
For if the king like not the comedy,

1685
01:41:29,706 --> 01:41:32,426
why then,
belike he like it not, perdy.

1686
01:41:32,426 --> 01:41:35,346
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word
with you. Sir, a whole history.

1687
01:41:35,346 --> 01:41:37,546
The king, sir. Ay, sir, what of him?

1688
01:41:37,546 --> 01:41:39,786
Is in his retirement
marvellous distempered.

1689
01:41:39,786 --> 01:41:41,506
With drink, sir?

1690
01:41:41,506 --> 01:41:43,186
No, my lord, rather with choler.

1691
01:41:43,186 --> 01:41:46,826
Good my lord, put your discourse
into some frame

1692
01:41:46,826 --> 01:41:49,746
and start not so wildly
from my affair.

1693
01:41:49,746 --> 01:41:52,746
I am tame, sir. Pronounce.

1694
01:41:52,746 --> 01:41:56,386
The queen, your mother,
in most great affliction of spirit,
hath sent me to you.

1695
01:41:56,386 --> 01:41:58,146
You are welcome. Nay good my lord.

1696
01:41:58,146 --> 01:42:01,546
If it shall please you to make me
a wholesome answer, I will do
your mother's commandment.

1697
01:42:01,546 --> 01:42:06,626
Oh, oh, oh, sir, I cannot. What, my
lord? Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.

1698
01:42:06,626 --> 01:42:09,426
My mother, you say?
Then thus she says,

1699
01:42:09,426 --> 01:42:13,786
your behavior hath struck her
into wonder and astonishment.

1700
01:42:13,786 --> 01:42:16,346
O, wonderful son,

1701
01:42:16,346 --> 01:42:19,626
that can so astonish a mother!

1702
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:24,506
Impart.
She desires to speak with you
in her closet, ere you go to bed.

1703
01:42:24,506 --> 01:42:28,546
We shall obey,
were she ten times our mother.

1704
01:42:32,426 --> 01:42:35,306
Have you any further trade with us?

1705
01:42:35,306 --> 01:42:37,226
My lord,

1706
01:42:37,226 --> 01:42:38,906
you once did love me.

1707
01:42:40,746 --> 01:42:43,506
So I do still,

1708
01:42:43,506 --> 01:42:46,306
by these pickers and stealers.

1709
01:42:46,306 --> 01:42:49,066
Good my lord,
what is your cause of distemper?

1710
01:42:49,066 --> 01:42:51,506
You do, surely, bar the door
upon your own liberty,

1711
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:53,386
if you deny your griefs
to your friend.

1712
01:42:53,386 --> 01:42:56,546
Sir, I lack advancement.

1713
01:42:56,546 --> 01:43:01,186
How can that be, when you have
the voice of the king himself
for your succession in Denmark?

1714
01:43:01,186 --> 01:43:03,146
Ay, but sir,

1715
01:43:03,146 --> 01:43:05,026
while the grass grows...

1716
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:10,146
The proverb is something musty.

1717
01:43:10,146 --> 01:43:13,706
O, the recorder! Let me see one.

1718
01:43:13,706 --> 01:43:16,066
To withdraw with you.

1719
01:43:18,306 --> 01:43:20,626
Why do you go about to recover
the wind of me,

1720
01:43:20,626 --> 01:43:22,506
as if you would
drive me into a toil?

1721
01:43:22,506 --> 01:43:27,666
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold,
my love is too unmannerly.

1722
01:43:29,826 --> 01:43:32,986
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?

1723
01:43:32,986 --> 01:43:36,626
My lord, I cannot. I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.

1724
01:43:36,626 --> 01:43:39,266
I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.

1725
01:43:39,266 --> 01:43:40,786
'Tis as easy as lying.

1726
01:43:40,786 --> 01:43:43,986
Govern these ventages
with your fingers and thumb,
give it breath with your mouth,

1727
01:43:43,986 --> 01:43:46,546
and it will discourse
most eloquent music.

1728
01:43:47,706 --> 01:43:49,746
Look you, these are the stops.

1729
01:43:49,746 --> 01:43:54,266
But these cannot I command
to any utterance of harmony.
I have not the skill.

1730
01:43:55,466 --> 01:43:57,866
Why, look you now,

1731
01:43:57,866 --> 01:44:00,146
how unworthy a thing you make of me!

1732
01:44:02,466 --> 01:44:05,346
You would play upon ME.

1733
01:44:05,346 --> 01:44:08,306
You would seem to know my stops.

1734
01:44:08,306 --> 01:44:10,986
You would pluck out
the heart of my mystery.

1735
01:44:10,986 --> 01:44:14,626
You would sound me from my lowest
note to the top of my compass

1736
01:44:14,626 --> 01:44:18,466
and there is much music, excellent
voice, in this little organ,

1737
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:20,866
yet cannot you make it speak?

1738
01:44:22,826 --> 01:44:22,906
'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe?

1739
01:44:22,906 --> 01:44:27,666
Call me what instrument you will,
though you can fret me,

1740
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:35,306
you cannot play upon me.

1741
01:44:36,506 --> 01:44:39,866
God bless you, sir!

1742
01:44:40,706 --> 01:44:44,866
My lord,
the queen would speak with you...

1743
01:44:44,866 --> 01:44:46,386
THEY PLAY RECORDERS

1744
01:44:49,306 --> 01:44:52,906
..and presently!

1745
01:44:56,146 --> 01:45:01,106
Do you see yonder cloud
that's almost in shape of a camel?

1746
01:45:01,106 --> 01:45:04,946
By the mass,
and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

1747
01:45:06,506 --> 01:45:09,066
Methinks it is like a weasel.

1748
01:45:09,066 --> 01:45:13,266
It is backed like a weasel.

1749
01:45:13,266 --> 01:45:16,546
Or like a whale? Very like a whale.

1750
01:45:19,346 --> 01:45:22,386
Then I will come to
my mother by and by.

1751
01:45:22,386 --> 01:45:26,106
They fool me to the top of my bent.

1752
01:45:26,106 --> 01:45:28,466
I will come by and by.

1753
01:45:28,466 --> 01:45:32,666
I will say so.
By and by is easily said!

1754
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:34,466
Leave me, friends.

1755
01:45:34,466 --> 01:45:37,426
HAMLET PLAYS "THREE BLIND MICE"

1756
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:47,786
'Tis now the very
witching time of night,

1757
01:45:47,786 --> 01:45:52,146
when churchyards yawn
and Hell itself breathes out

1758
01:45:52,146 --> 01:45:58,626
contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood,

1759
01:45:58,626 --> 01:46:02,146
and do such bitter business
as the day

1760
01:46:02,146 --> 01:46:05,146
would quake to look on.

1761
01:46:05,146 --> 01:46:09,106
Soft! Now to my mother.

1762
01:46:10,706 --> 01:46:16,626
I will speak daggers to her,
but use none.

1763
01:46:16,626 --> 01:46:21,026
I like him not,
nor stands it safe with us

1764
01:46:21,026 --> 01:46:26,386
to let his madness range.
Therefore prepare you.

1765
01:46:26,386 --> 01:46:28,906
I your commission
will forthwith dispatch,

1766
01:46:28,906 --> 01:46:31,026
and he to England
shall along with you.

1767
01:46:31,026 --> 01:46:33,786
The terms of our estate
may not endure

1768
01:46:33,786 --> 01:46:36,666
hazard so dangerous
as doth hourly grow

1769
01:46:36,666 --> 01:46:38,026
out of his lunacy.

1770
01:46:38,026 --> 01:46:39,626
We will ourselves provide.

1771
01:46:39,626 --> 01:46:41,906
Most holy and religious fear it is

1772
01:46:41,906 --> 01:46:44,266
to keep those many, many bodies safe

1773
01:46:44,266 --> 01:46:46,826
that live and feed
upon your majesty.

1774
01:46:46,826 --> 01:46:50,706
Never alone did the king sigh,
but with a general groan.

1775
01:46:50,706 --> 01:46:54,066
For majesty is like a massy wheel,

1776
01:46:54,066 --> 01:46:56,826
fix'd on the summit
of the highest mount

1777
01:46:56,826 --> 01:46:59,666
to whose huge spokes
10,000 lesser things

1778
01:46:59,666 --> 01:47:02,826
are morticed and adjoin'd.

1779
01:47:02,826 --> 01:47:07,226
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage,

1780
01:47:07,226 --> 01:47:09,746
for we will fetters put
upon this fear,

1781
01:47:09,746 --> 01:47:12,386
which now goes too free-footed.

1782
01:47:12,386 --> 01:47:13,866
We will haste us.

1783
01:47:15,466 --> 01:47:19,106
My lord,
he's going to his mother's closet.

1784
01:47:19,106 --> 01:47:21,906
Behind the arras
I'll convey myself

1785
01:47:21,906 --> 01:47:25,906
to hear the process -
I'll warrant she'll tax him home.

1786
01:47:25,906 --> 01:47:27,706
Fare you well, my liege.

1787
01:47:27,706 --> 01:47:31,906
I'll call upon you ere you go
to bed, and tell you what I know.

1788
01:47:31,906 --> 01:47:34,106
Thanks, dear my lord.

1789
01:47:39,106 --> 01:47:42,466
HE COUGHS

1790
01:47:47,266 --> 01:47:50,466
O, my offence is rank.

1791
01:47:50,466 --> 01:47:54,346
It smells to heaven.

1792
01:47:56,466 --> 01:47:59,506
It hath the primal eldest curse
upon't -

1793
01:48:01,306 --> 01:48:04,226
a brother's murder.

1794
01:48:08,906 --> 01:48:11,066
Pray can I not,

1795
01:48:12,666 --> 01:48:16,826
though inclination
be as sharp as will -

1796
01:48:16,826 --> 01:48:21,066
my stronger guilt
defeats my strong intent.

1797
01:48:21,066 --> 01:48:24,946
And, like a man
to double business bound,

1798
01:48:24,946 --> 01:48:27,626
I stand in pause
where I shall first begin,

1799
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:29,786
and both neglect.

1800
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:34,586
What if this curs-ed hand

1801
01:48:34,586 --> 01:48:38,466
were thicker than itself
with brother's blood?

1802
01:48:38,466 --> 01:48:41,266
Is there not rain enough
in the sweet Heavens

1803
01:48:41,266 --> 01:48:43,386
to wash it white as snow?

1804
01:48:44,986 --> 01:48:47,506
Whereto serves mercy

1805
01:48:47,506 --> 01:48:51,266
but to confront
the visage of offence?

1806
01:48:51,266 --> 01:48:54,986
And what's in prayer
but this two-fold force

1807
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:59,586
to be forestalled
ere we come to fall,

1808
01:48:59,586 --> 01:49:02,626
or pardon'd, being down?

1809
01:49:04,306 --> 01:49:07,026
Then I'll look up.

1810
01:49:07,026 --> 01:49:09,106
My fault is past.

1811
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:14,426
But, O, what form of prayer

1812
01:49:14,426 --> 01:49:19,146
can serve my turn?
"Forgive me my foul murder?"

1813
01:49:19,146 --> 01:49:24,226
That cannot be,
since I am still possess'd

1814
01:49:24,226 --> 01:49:30,746
of those effects
for which I did the murder -

1815
01:49:30,746 --> 01:49:37,986
my crown, mine own ambition
and my queen.

1816
01:49:39,586 --> 01:49:45,146
May one be pardon'd
and retain the offence?

1817
01:49:45,146 --> 01:49:48,426
In the corrupted currents
of this world,

1818
01:49:48,426 --> 01:49:52,826
offence's gilded hand
may shove by justice,

1819
01:49:52,826 --> 01:49:55,426
and oft 'tis seen
the wicked prize itself

1820
01:49:55,426 --> 01:50:00,866
buys out the law,
but 'tis not so above.

1821
01:50:02,466 --> 01:50:06,226
There is no shuffling.

1822
01:50:06,226 --> 01:50:08,066
There the action lies

1823
01:50:08,066 --> 01:50:12,266
in his true nature,
and we ourselves compell'd,

1824
01:50:12,266 --> 01:50:14,946
even to the teeth
and forehead of our faults,

1825
01:50:14,946 --> 01:50:16,906
to give in evidence.

1826
01:50:18,466 --> 01:50:20,306
What then?

1827
01:50:20,306 --> 01:50:23,346
What rests?

1828
01:50:23,346 --> 01:50:25,746
Try what repentance can.

1829
01:50:25,746 --> 01:50:27,946
O...

1830
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:29,906
what can it not?

1831
01:50:31,226 --> 01:50:35,706
But what can it,
when one cannot repent?

1832
01:50:38,786 --> 01:50:42,306
O wretched state!

1833
01:50:42,306 --> 01:50:46,106
O bosom black as death!

1834
01:50:46,106 --> 01:50:51,946
O lime-ed soul, that,
struggling to be free,

1835
01:50:51,946 --> 01:50:54,146
art more engaged!

1836
01:50:56,026 --> 01:51:00,666
Help, angels!

1837
01:51:00,666 --> 01:51:02,826
Make assay!

1838
01:51:04,426 --> 01:51:07,226
Bow, stubborn knees,

1839
01:51:07,226 --> 01:51:13,386
and heart with strings of steel,

1840
01:51:13,386 --> 01:51:16,626
be soft as sinews
of the newborn babe.

1841
01:51:22,546 --> 01:51:24,666
All may yet be well.

1842
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:29,466
HE MOUTHS

1843
01:51:30,946 --> 01:51:32,866
Now might I do it pat,

1844
01:51:36,306 --> 01:51:38,346
now he is praying.

1845
01:51:41,266 --> 01:51:42,946
And now I'll do't!

1846
01:51:45,466 --> 01:51:47,506
And so he goes to heaven,

1847
01:51:47,506 --> 01:51:50,666
and so am I revenged.
That would be scann'd.

1848
01:51:50,666 --> 01:51:53,026
A villain kills my father,
and for that,

1849
01:51:53,026 --> 01:51:56,026
I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to Heaven?

1850
01:51:57,626 --> 01:52:00,106
O, this is hire and salary,
not revenge.

1851
01:52:04,186 --> 01:52:08,466
He took my father grossly,
full of bread,

1852
01:52:08,466 --> 01:52:11,626
with all his crimes broad blown,
as flush as May.

1853
01:52:13,546 --> 01:52:16,506
And how his audit stands,
who knows save Heaven?

1854
01:52:18,386 --> 01:52:19,866
Am I then revenged,

1855
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:22,066
to take him
in the purging of his soul,

1856
01:52:22,066 --> 01:52:26,066
when he is fit and season'd
for his passage?

1857
01:52:26,066 --> 01:52:28,066
No!

1858
01:52:29,546 --> 01:52:32,346
Up, blade,

1859
01:52:32,346 --> 01:52:34,746
and know thou a more horrid hent,

1860
01:52:37,546 --> 01:52:43,186
when he is drunk asleep,
or in his rage,

1861
01:52:43,186 --> 01:52:45,986
or in the incestuous pleasure
of his bed,

1862
01:52:48,146 --> 01:52:51,026
at gaming, swearing,
or about some act

1863
01:52:51,026 --> 01:52:53,746
that has no relish
of salvation in't.

1864
01:52:55,386 --> 01:53:01,266
Then trip him, that his heels
may kick at Heaven,

1865
01:53:01,266 --> 01:53:05,506
and that his soul may be
as damn'd and black

1866
01:53:05,506 --> 01:53:07,946
as Hell, whereto it goes.

1867
01:53:12,626 --> 01:53:14,506
My mother stays.

1868
01:53:17,986 --> 01:53:21,786
This physic but prolongs
thy sickly days.

1869
01:53:29,506 --> 01:53:32,306
My words fly up,

1870
01:53:34,506 --> 01:53:36,586
my thoughts remain below.

1871
01:53:43,106 --> 01:53:47,506
Words without thoughts
never to Heaven go.

1872
01:53:55,786 --> 01:53:59,106
He will come straight.
Look you, lay home to him.

1873
01:53:59,106 --> 01:54:02,066
Tell him his pranks
have been too broad to bear with,

1874
01:54:02,066 --> 01:54:04,506
And that your grace hath screen'd
and stood between

1875
01:54:04,506 --> 01:54:08,226
Much heat and him.
I'll silence me even here.

1876
01:54:08,226 --> 01:54:11,706
Pray you, be round with him.
KNOCK AT DOOR

1877
01:54:11,706 --> 01:54:13,946
I'll warrant you, Fear me not.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.

1878
01:54:13,946 --> 01:54:16,386
Mother! Mother!

1879
01:54:16,386 --> 01:54:18,746
Mother!

1880
01:54:21,386 --> 01:54:24,826
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

1881
01:54:24,826 --> 01:54:28,466
Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.

1882
01:54:28,466 --> 01:54:30,426
Mother, you have my father
much offended.

1883
01:54:30,426 --> 01:54:32,746
Come, come, you answer
with an idle tongue.

1884
01:54:32,746 --> 01:54:35,506
Go, go, you question with a wicked
tongue. Why, how now, Hamlet!

1885
01:54:35,506 --> 01:54:37,946
What's the matter now?

1886
01:54:40,786 --> 01:54:42,306
Have you forgot me?

1887
01:54:42,306 --> 01:54:45,546
No, by the rood, not so.

1888
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:49,986
You are the queen,
your husband's brother's wife,

1889
01:54:49,986 --> 01:54:52,386
and - would it were not so! -

1890
01:54:52,386 --> 01:54:55,106
you are my mother.

1891
01:54:55,106 --> 01:54:57,746
Nay, then, I'll set those to you
that can speak.

1892
01:54:57,746 --> 01:55:00,706
Come, come, and sit you down,
you shall not budge.

1893
01:55:00,706 --> 01:55:02,826
You go not till I set you up a glass

1894
01:55:02,826 --> 01:55:05,546
where you may see
the inmost part of you.

1895
01:55:05,546 --> 01:55:07,546
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me!

1896
01:55:09,706 --> 01:55:12,986
Help, help, ho!

1897
01:55:12,986 --> 01:55:16,226
What, ho! Help, help, help! How now!

1898
01:55:16,226 --> 01:55:19,106
A rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

1899
01:55:19,106 --> 01:55:21,386
GUNSHOT

1900
01:55:28,746 --> 01:55:30,586
What hast thou done?

1901
01:55:30,586 --> 01:55:35,186
Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

1902
01:55:37,466 --> 01:55:40,386
O, what a rash and bloody deed
is this!

1903
01:55:40,386 --> 01:55:44,466
A bloody deed!
Almost as bad, good mother,

1904
01:55:44,466 --> 01:55:47,026
as kill a king,
and marry with his brother.

1905
01:55:47,026 --> 01:55:48,946
As kill a king!

1906
01:55:48,946 --> 01:55:51,506
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

1907
01:55:53,826 --> 01:55:56,986
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!

1908
01:55:59,226 --> 01:56:03,426
I took thee for thy better.
Take thy fortune.

1909
01:56:03,426 --> 01:56:07,066
Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace! Sit you down,

1910
01:56:07,066 --> 01:56:10,866
and let me wring your heart,
for so I shall,

1911
01:56:10,866 --> 01:56:13,146
if it be made of penetrable stuff.

1912
01:56:13,146 --> 01:56:15,866
What have I done,
that thou darest wag thy tongue

1913
01:56:15,866 --> 01:56:18,866
in noise so rude against me?
Such an act

1914
01:56:18,866 --> 01:56:22,266
That blurs the grace
and blush of modesty,

1915
01:56:22,266 --> 01:56:25,786
Calls virtue hypocrite,
makes marriage-vows

1916
01:56:25,786 --> 01:56:29,586
as false as dicers' oaths.
Ay me, what act,

1917
01:56:29,586 --> 01:56:33,066
that roars so loud,
and thunders in the index?

1918
01:56:33,066 --> 01:56:37,186
Look here, upon this picture,

1919
01:56:37,186 --> 01:56:41,386
and...on this.

1920
01:56:41,386 --> 01:56:44,346
The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

1921
01:56:44,346 --> 01:56:47,506
See, what a grace
was seated on this brow.

1922
01:56:49,186 --> 01:56:52,306
Hyperion's curls,

1923
01:56:52,306 --> 01:56:55,906
the front of Jove himself.

1924
01:56:55,906 --> 01:57:00,466
An eye like Mars,
to threaten and command.

1925
01:57:00,466 --> 01:57:02,786
A station like the herald Mercury

1926
01:57:02,786 --> 01:57:05,706
new-lighted
on a Heaven-kissing hill,

1927
01:57:05,706 --> 01:57:07,906
a combination and a form indeed,

1928
01:57:07,906 --> 01:57:10,146
where every god
did seem to set his seal,

1929
01:57:10,146 --> 01:57:13,586
to give the world
assurance of a man.

1930
01:57:13,586 --> 01:57:15,946
This was your husband.

1931
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:20,906
Look you now, what follows.

1932
01:57:20,906 --> 01:57:25,106
Here is your husband,
like a mildew'd ear,

1933
01:57:25,106 --> 01:57:28,866
blasting his wholesome brother.
Have you eyes?

1934
01:57:28,866 --> 01:57:32,506
Could you on this fair
mountain leave to feed,

1935
01:57:32,506 --> 01:57:36,066
and batten on this moor? Ha!
Have you eyes?

1936
01:57:36,066 --> 01:57:38,706
You cannot call it love,
for at your age

1937
01:57:38,706 --> 01:57:41,986
the hey-day in the blood is tame,
it's humble,

1938
01:57:41,986 --> 01:57:44,786
and waits upon the judgement
and what judgement

1939
01:57:44,786 --> 01:57:48,226
would step from this to this?
What devil was't

1940
01:57:48,226 --> 01:57:51,346
that thus hath cozen'd you
at hoodman-blind?

1941
01:57:52,946 --> 01:57:56,266
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight,

1942
01:57:56,266 --> 01:58:00,066
ears without hands or eyes,
smelling sans all,

1943
01:58:00,066 --> 01:58:02,906
or but a sickly part
of one true sense

1944
01:58:02,906 --> 01:58:05,546
Could not so mope.

1945
01:58:05,546 --> 01:58:08,066
O shame! Where is thy blush?

1946
01:58:08,066 --> 01:58:10,066
O Hamlet, speak no more.

1947
01:58:10,066 --> 01:58:13,266
Thou turn'st mine eyes
into my very soul.

1948
01:58:13,266 --> 01:58:16,066
and there I see such black
and grain-ed spots

1949
01:58:16,066 --> 01:58:18,066
as will not leave their tinct.

1950
01:58:18,066 --> 01:58:20,066
Nay, but to live

1951
01:58:20,066 --> 01:58:24,826
in the rank sweat
of an enseam-ed bed,

1952
01:58:24,826 --> 01:58:28,466
stew'd in corruption,
honeying and making love

1953
01:58:28,466 --> 01:58:31,706
over the nasty sty.
O, speak to me no more!

1954
01:58:31,706 --> 01:58:33,786
These words, like daggers,
enter in mine ears.

1955
01:58:33,786 --> 01:58:35,266
No more, sweet Hamlet!

1956
01:58:35,266 --> 01:58:38,546
A murderer and a villain.

1957
01:58:38,546 --> 01:58:42,506
A slave that is not
twentieth part the tithe

1958
01:58:42,506 --> 01:58:45,546
of your precedent lord.
A vice of kings,

1959
01:58:45,546 --> 01:58:48,626
a cutpurse of the empire
and the rule,

1960
01:58:48,626 --> 01:58:51,826
who from a shelf
the precious diadem stole,

1961
01:58:51,826 --> 01:58:54,306
and put it in his pocket! No more!

1962
01:58:54,306 --> 01:58:56,826
A king of shreds and patches.
CLOCK CHIMES

1963
01:58:59,626 --> 01:59:03,226
Save me, and hover o'er me
with your wings,

1964
01:59:03,226 --> 01:59:05,426
you heavenly guards!

1965
01:59:05,426 --> 01:59:10,226
What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he's mad!

1966
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:12,546
Do you not come
your tardy son to chide,

1967
01:59:12,546 --> 01:59:15,506
that, lapsed in time and passion,
lets go by

1968
01:59:15,506 --> 01:59:18,866
the important acting
of your dread command?

1969
01:59:18,866 --> 01:59:20,586
O, say!

1970
01:59:20,586 --> 01:59:23,546
Do not forget this visitation

1971
01:59:23,546 --> 01:59:27,666
is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.

1972
01:59:30,066 --> 01:59:35,066
But, look, amazement
on thy mother sits.

1973
01:59:35,066 --> 01:59:41,066
O, step between her
and her fighting soul.

1974
01:59:41,066 --> 01:59:45,866
Conceit in weakest bodies
strongest works.

1975
01:59:45,866 --> 01:59:48,506
Speak to her, Hamlet.

1976
01:59:48,506 --> 01:59:51,466
How is it with you, lady?

1977
01:59:51,466 --> 01:59:54,866
Alas, how is't with you,

1978
01:59:54,866 --> 01:59:57,426
that you do bend your eye on vacancy

1979
01:59:57,426 --> 02:00:00,426
and with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?

1980
02:00:00,426 --> 02:00:03,466
Forth at your eyes
your spirits wildly peep.

1981
02:00:03,466 --> 02:00:06,946
O gentle son, upon the heat
and flame of thy distemper

1982
02:00:06,946 --> 02:00:10,826
sprinkle cool patience.
Whereon do you look?

1983
02:00:10,826 --> 02:00:15,626
On him, on him! Look you!
How pale he glares!

1984
02:00:18,386 --> 02:00:20,306
Do not look upon me,

1985
02:00:20,306 --> 02:00:22,786
lest with this piteous action
you convert

1986
02:00:22,786 --> 02:00:25,466
my stern effects.
Then what I have to do

1987
02:00:25,466 --> 02:00:28,426
will want true colour,
tears perchance for blood.

1988
02:00:28,426 --> 02:00:31,546
To whom do you speak this?

1989
02:00:33,146 --> 02:00:34,906
Do you see nothing there?

1990
02:00:34,906 --> 02:00:38,826
Nothing at all, yet all there is
I see. Nor did you nothing hear?

1991
02:00:38,826 --> 02:00:41,306
No, nothing but ourselves.

1992
02:00:41,306 --> 02:00:43,746
Why, look you now!
Look, how it steals away!

1993
02:00:43,746 --> 02:00:46,426
My father, in his habit as he lived!

1994
02:00:46,426 --> 02:00:51,266
Look, where he goes, even now,
out at the portal!

1995
02:00:51,266 --> 02:00:53,626
This is the very coinage
of your brain.

1996
02:00:53,626 --> 02:00:56,346
This bodiless creation ecstasy

1997
02:00:56,346 --> 02:00:58,106
is very cunning in.

1998
02:00:58,106 --> 02:01:03,546
Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours,
doth temperately keep time,

1999
02:01:03,546 --> 02:01:06,306
and makes as healthful music.
It is not madness

2000
02:01:06,306 --> 02:01:08,306
that I have utter'd.
Bring me to the test,

2001
02:01:08,306 --> 02:01:11,226
I the matter will re-word,
which madness would gambol from.

2002
02:01:11,226 --> 02:01:13,066
Mother, for love of grace,

2003
02:01:13,066 --> 02:01:16,226
lay not that flattering unction
to your soul,

2004
02:01:16,226 --> 02:01:18,386
that not your trespass,
but my madness speaks.

2005
02:01:18,386 --> 02:01:21,106
It will but skin and film
the ulcerous place,

2006
02:01:21,106 --> 02:01:23,946
whilst rank corruption,
mining all within,

2007
02:01:23,946 --> 02:01:26,706
infects unseen.
Confess yourself to Heaven,

2008
02:01:26,706 --> 02:01:28,986
repent what's past,
avoid what is to come,

2009
02:01:28,986 --> 02:01:31,466
and do not spread the compost
on the weeds

2010
02:01:31,466 --> 02:01:32,786
to make them ranker.

2011
02:01:32,786 --> 02:01:35,706
O Hamlet,
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

2012
02:01:35,706 --> 02:01:37,626
O, throw away the worser
part of it,

2013
02:01:37,626 --> 02:01:39,666
and live the purer with
the other half.

2014
02:01:46,226 --> 02:01:47,706
Good night,

2015
02:01:50,306 --> 02:01:52,986
but go not to mine uncle's bed.

2016
02:01:52,986 --> 02:01:56,426
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

2017
02:01:56,426 --> 02:01:59,306
Refrain tonight, and that
shall lend a kind of easiness

2018
02:01:59,306 --> 02:02:02,066
to the next abstinence.

2019
02:02:04,146 --> 02:02:06,066
Once more, good night.

2020
02:02:08,506 --> 02:02:12,066
And when you are desirous
to be bless'd,

2021
02:02:12,066 --> 02:02:13,866
I'll blessing beg of you.

2022
02:02:15,826 --> 02:02:18,186
For this same lord,

2023
02:02:21,026 --> 02:02:22,786
I do repent,

2024
02:02:25,106 --> 02:02:27,466
but Heaven hath pleased it so,

2025
02:02:27,466 --> 02:02:31,746
to punish me with this
and this with me,

2026
02:02:31,746 --> 02:02:34,386
that I must be their
scourge and minister.

2027
02:02:36,786 --> 02:02:38,666
I will bestow him,

2028
02:02:38,666 --> 02:02:41,466
and will answer well
the death I gave him.

2029
02:02:41,466 --> 02:02:42,946
So, again, good night.

2030
02:02:44,906 --> 02:02:47,626
I must be cruel, only to be kind.

2031
02:02:50,626 --> 02:02:53,146
Thus bad begins

2032
02:02:53,146 --> 02:02:55,866
and worse remains behind.

2033
02:02:57,426 --> 02:02:59,866
One more word, good lady.
What shall I do?

2034
02:02:59,866 --> 02:03:03,026
Not this, by no means,
that I bid you do.

2035
02:03:03,026 --> 02:03:05,506
Let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,

2036
02:03:05,506 --> 02:03:09,306
pinch wanton on your cheeks,
call you his mouse.

2037
02:03:09,306 --> 02:03:11,546
And let him,
for a pair of reechy kisses,

2038
02:03:11,546 --> 02:03:14,306
or paddling in your neck
with his damn'd fingers,

2039
02:03:14,306 --> 02:03:15,826
make you to
ravel all this matter out,

2040
02:03:15,826 --> 02:03:17,986
that I essentially am not
in madness, but mad in craft.

2041
02:03:17,986 --> 02:03:20,506
Be thou assured,
if words be made of breath,

2042
02:03:20,506 --> 02:03:24,266
and breath of life,
I have no life to breathe

2043
02:03:24,266 --> 02:03:26,066
what thou hast said to me.

2044
02:03:39,266 --> 02:03:41,266
Sssh.

2045
02:03:54,186 --> 02:03:57,106
I must to England, you know that?

2046
02:03:58,386 --> 02:04:01,666
Alack, I had forgot.

2047
02:04:04,146 --> 02:04:07,146
'Tis so concluded on.

2048
02:04:07,146 --> 02:04:08,746
There's letters seal'd

2049
02:04:11,346 --> 02:04:13,346
and my two schoolfellows,

2050
02:04:13,346 --> 02:04:16,506
whom I will trust
as I will adders fang'd,

2051
02:04:18,066 --> 02:04:21,146
they bear the mandate,

2052
02:04:21,146 --> 02:04:26,266
they must sweep my way, and
marshal me to knavery. Let it work.

2053
02:04:26,266 --> 02:04:29,026
For 'tis the sport
to have the engineer

2054
02:04:29,026 --> 02:04:33,226
hoist with his own
petard and 't shall go hard.

2055
02:04:33,226 --> 02:04:37,146
But I will delve
one yard below their mines,

2056
02:04:37,146 --> 02:04:39,546
and blow them at the moon.

2057
02:04:39,546 --> 02:04:42,026
O, 'tis most sweet,

2058
02:04:42,026 --> 02:04:45,506
when in one line
two crafts directly meet.

2059
02:05:03,066 --> 02:05:05,066
This man shall set me packing.

2060
02:05:10,186 --> 02:05:13,346
I'll lug the guts into
the neighbour room.

2061
02:05:13,346 --> 02:05:14,786
Mother, good night.

2062
02:05:18,946 --> 02:05:22,946
Indeed this counsellor
is now most still,

2063
02:05:22,946 --> 02:05:25,426
most secret

2064
02:05:25,426 --> 02:05:28,186
and most grave,

2065
02:05:28,186 --> 02:05:31,826
who was in life a foolish
prating knave.

2066
02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:36,466
Come, sir,

2067
02:05:36,466 --> 02:05:38,826
to draw toward an end with you.

2068
02:06:03,986 --> 02:06:06,146
Good night, mother.

2069
02:06:06,146 --> 02:06:08,946
SHE LAUGHS THEN SOBS

2070
02:06:25,226 --> 02:06:30,186
There's matter in these sighs,
these profound heaves.

2071
02:06:30,186 --> 02:06:32,786
You must translate.

2072
02:06:32,786 --> 02:06:34,786
'Tis fit we understand them.

2073
02:06:36,546 --> 02:06:38,306
Where is your son?

2074
02:06:38,306 --> 02:06:43,986
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen
tonight! What, Gertrude?

2075
02:06:43,986 --> 02:06:45,546
How does Hamlet?

2076
02:06:45,546 --> 02:06:47,466
Mad

2077
02:06:47,466 --> 02:06:53,426
as the sea and wind, when both
contend which is the mightier.

2078
02:06:53,426 --> 02:06:55,866
In his lawless fit,

2079
02:06:55,866 --> 02:06:59,146
behind the mirror
hearing something stir,

2080
02:06:59,146 --> 02:07:02,346
whips out his weapon, cries,
"A rat, a rat!"

2081
02:07:02,346 --> 02:07:04,626
And, in this brainish apprehension,

2082
02:07:04,626 --> 02:07:07,826
kills the unseen good old man.

2083
02:07:11,906 --> 02:07:13,706
O, heavy deed!

2084
02:07:16,026 --> 02:07:18,626
It had been so with us,
had we been there.

2085
02:07:20,226 --> 02:07:23,706
His liberty is full
of threats to all.

2086
02:07:23,706 --> 02:07:26,546
To you yourself, to us,

2087
02:07:26,546 --> 02:07:29,586
to every one.

2088
02:07:29,586 --> 02:07:32,786
Alas, how will this
bloody deed be answer'd?

2089
02:07:32,786 --> 02:07:34,226
It will be laid to us,

2090
02:07:34,226 --> 02:07:37,026
whose providence
should have kept short,

2091
02:07:37,026 --> 02:07:42,106
restrain'd and out of haunt,
this mad young man.

2092
02:07:42,106 --> 02:07:48,746
But so much was our love, we could
not understand what was most fit.

2093
02:07:48,746 --> 02:07:52,226
But, like the owner
of a foul disease,

2094
02:07:52,226 --> 02:07:55,706
to keep it from divulging,
let it feed,

2095
02:07:55,706 --> 02:07:57,866
even on the pith of Life.

2096
02:07:57,866 --> 02:08:02,106
Where is he gone? To draw apart
the body he hath kill'd,

2097
02:08:02,106 --> 02:08:05,586
o'er whom his madness
weeps for what is done.

2098
02:08:05,586 --> 02:08:10,706
O Gertrude, come! The sun no
sooner shall the mountains touch,

2099
02:08:10,706 --> 02:08:12,906
but we will ship him hence.

2100
02:08:12,906 --> 02:08:17,986
And this vile deed we must,
with all our majesty and skill,

2101
02:08:17,986 --> 02:08:22,146
both countenance and excuse.

2102
02:08:23,346 --> 02:08:24,826
Guildenstern!

2103
02:08:27,426 --> 02:08:32,026
Friends both, go
join you with some further aid.

2104
02:08:34,186 --> 02:08:37,786
Hamlet in madness
hath Polonius slain,

2105
02:08:37,786 --> 02:08:40,586
and from his mother's closet
hath he dragg'd him.

2106
02:08:40,586 --> 02:08:42,546
Go seek him out.

2107
02:08:42,546 --> 02:08:48,626
Speak fair,
and bring the body into the chapel.

2108
02:08:48,626 --> 02:08:49,906
I pray you, make haste.

2109
02:08:52,506 --> 02:08:55,226
Oh, Gertrude, come.

2110
02:08:55,226 --> 02:08:57,346
Let's call up our wisest friends,

2111
02:08:57,346 --> 02:08:59,946
and let them know
both what we mean to do

2112
02:09:01,506 --> 02:09:03,506
and what's untimely done.

2113
02:09:05,706 --> 02:09:08,706
Come away.

2114
02:09:08,706 --> 02:09:12,106
My soul is full of
discord and dismay.

2115
02:09:18,746 --> 02:09:20,586
SHOUTING

2116
02:09:30,786 --> 02:09:32,866
Safely stowed.

2117
02:09:32,866 --> 02:09:34,906
Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

2118
02:09:34,906 --> 02:09:36,346
What noise?

2119
02:09:37,746 --> 02:09:39,266
Here they come.

2120
02:09:43,866 --> 02:09:46,026
What have you done, my lord,
with the dead body?

2121
02:09:47,626 --> 02:09:50,706
Compounded it with dust,
whereto 'tis kin.

2122
02:09:50,706 --> 02:09:55,706
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take
it thence and bear it to the chapel.

2123
02:09:55,706 --> 02:09:58,586
Do not believe it. Believe what?

2124
02:09:58,586 --> 02:10:01,106
That I can keep your
counsel and not mine own.

2125
02:10:01,106 --> 02:10:04,266
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!

2126
02:10:04,266 --> 02:10:07,906
What replication should be
made by the son of a king?

2127
02:10:07,906 --> 02:10:11,546
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

2128
02:10:13,106 --> 02:10:14,946
Ay, sir,

2129
02:10:14,946 --> 02:10:17,906
that soaks up
the king's countenance,

2130
02:10:17,906 --> 02:10:20,386
his rewards, his authorities.

2131
02:10:20,386 --> 02:10:26,266
But such officers do the
king best service in the end.

2132
02:10:26,266 --> 02:10:28,306
He keeps them,

2133
02:10:28,306 --> 02:10:32,706
like an ape, an apple
in the corner of his jaw.

2134
02:10:32,706 --> 02:10:34,906
First mouthed,

2135
02:10:34,906 --> 02:10:36,706
to be last swallowed

2136
02:10:36,706 --> 02:10:42,106
when he needs what you have gleaned,
it is but squeezing you,

2137
02:10:42,106 --> 02:10:44,986
and, sponge, you shall be dry again.

2138
02:10:44,986 --> 02:10:47,346
I understand you not, my lord.

2139
02:10:47,346 --> 02:10:49,266
I am glad of it.

2140
02:10:49,266 --> 02:10:53,026
A knavish speech
sleeps in a foolish ear.

2141
02:10:53,026 --> 02:10:56,426
My lord, you must tell us where the
body is, and go with us to the king.

2142
02:10:56,426 --> 02:11:01,306
The body is with the king,
but the king is not with the body.

2143
02:11:01,306 --> 02:11:04,506
The king is a thing.

2144
02:11:04,506 --> 02:11:07,866
A thing, my lord! Of nothing.

2145
02:11:14,106 --> 02:11:15,746
Bring me to him.

2146
02:11:17,386 --> 02:11:19,306
Hide fox, and all after.

2147
02:11:20,346 --> 02:11:23,586
I have sent to seek him,
and to find the body.

2148
02:11:23,586 --> 02:11:27,346
How dangerous is it
that this man goes loose!

2149
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:30,346
Yet must not we put
the strong law on him.

2150
02:11:30,346 --> 02:11:33,226
He's loved
of the distracted multitude,

2151
02:11:33,226 --> 02:11:36,506
who like not in their judgment,
but their eyes.

2152
02:11:36,506 --> 02:11:39,666
And where tis so,
the offender's scourge is weigh'd,

2153
02:11:39,666 --> 02:11:41,106
but never the offence.

2154
02:11:41,106 --> 02:11:43,146
To bear all smooth and even,

2155
02:11:43,146 --> 02:11:47,466
this sudden sending him away
must seem deliberate cause.

2156
02:11:47,466 --> 02:11:51,226
Diseases desperate grown by
desperate measure are relieved,

2157
02:11:51,226 --> 02:11:53,706
or not at all.
How now! what hath befall'n?

2158
02:11:53,706 --> 02:11:58,426
Where the dead body is bestow'd,
my lord, We cannot get from him.

2159
02:11:58,426 --> 02:12:02,186
But where is he? Without, my lord,
guarded, to know your pleasure.

2160
02:12:02,186 --> 02:12:05,146
Bring him before us.
Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

2161
02:12:09,866 --> 02:12:11,346
Now, Hamlet,

2162
02:12:14,506 --> 02:12:16,826
where is Polonius?

2163
02:12:16,826 --> 02:12:18,346
At supper.

2164
02:12:18,346 --> 02:12:21,146
At supper! Where?

2165
02:12:21,146 --> 02:12:24,186
Not where he eats,
but where he is eaten.

2166
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:28,426
A certain convocation of
politic worms are e'en at him.

2167
02:12:28,426 --> 02:12:31,026
Your worm is your
only emperor for diet.

2168
02:12:31,026 --> 02:12:33,226
We fat all creatures else
to fat ourselves,

2169
02:12:33,226 --> 02:12:36,266
we fat ourselves for maggots.
Alas, alas!

2170
02:12:36,266 --> 02:12:41,706
A man may fish with the worm that
hath eat of a king, and eat of the
fish that hath fed of that worm.

2171
02:12:41,706 --> 02:12:43,626
What dost you mean by this?

2172
02:12:43,626 --> 02:12:49,426
Nothing but to show you how
a king may go a progress
through the guts of a beggar.

2173
02:12:49,426 --> 02:12:51,066
Where is Polonius?

2174
02:12:51,066 --> 02:12:53,946
In heaven!

2175
02:12:53,946 --> 02:12:56,626
Send hither to see.

2176
02:12:56,626 --> 02:13:00,746
If your messenger find him
not there, seek him i'
the other place yourself.

2177
02:13:00,746 --> 02:13:05,266
But indeed, if you find
him not within this...month,

2178
02:13:05,266 --> 02:13:09,586
you shall nose him
as you go upstairs into the lobby.

2179
02:13:09,586 --> 02:13:11,066
Seek him there.

2180
02:13:14,426 --> 02:13:16,226
He will stay till ye come.

2181
02:13:18,746 --> 02:13:23,306
Hamlet, this deed,
for thine especial safety,

2182
02:13:23,306 --> 02:13:28,306
which we do tender, as we dearly
grieve for that which thou hast done,

2183
02:13:28,306 --> 02:13:31,226
must send thee hence
with fiery quickness.

2184
02:13:31,226 --> 02:13:33,626
Therefore prepare thyself.

2185
02:13:33,626 --> 02:13:38,266
The bark is ready, and the wind
at help, the associates tend,

2186
02:13:38,266 --> 02:13:42,706
and everything is bent for England.
For England!

2187
02:13:42,706 --> 02:13:46,466
Ay, Hamlet. Good. So is it,
if thou knew'st our purposes.

2188
02:13:46,466 --> 02:13:49,266
I see a cherub that sees them.

2189
02:13:51,506 --> 02:13:54,586
Come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.

2190
02:13:54,586 --> 02:13:56,866
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

2191
02:13:56,866 --> 02:13:58,946
My mother,

2192
02:13:58,946 --> 02:14:05,106
father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh,
and so, my mother.

2193
02:14:05,106 --> 02:14:07,346
Come, for England!

2194
02:14:11,666 --> 02:14:13,266
Whee!

2195
02:14:15,266 --> 02:14:18,306
Follow him at foot.
Tempt him with speed aboard.

2196
02:14:18,306 --> 02:14:20,626
Delay it not.
I'll have him hence tonight.

2197
02:14:20,626 --> 02:14:24,666
For every thing is seal'd and done
that else leans on this affair. Away.

2198
02:14:29,826 --> 02:14:31,626
And, England,

2199
02:14:31,626 --> 02:14:33,706
if my love thou hold'st at aught,

2200
02:14:33,706 --> 02:14:36,826
thou mayst not coldly set
our sovereign purpose.

2201
02:14:38,786 --> 02:14:42,106
The present death of Hamlet.

2202
02:14:42,106 --> 02:14:44,386
Do it, England,

2203
02:14:44,386 --> 02:14:49,386
for like the hectic in my blood
he rages, and thou must cure me.

2204
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:53,866
Till I know 'tis done,

2205
02:14:53,866 --> 02:14:58,506
whate'er may hap,
my joys were ne'er begun.

2206
02:14:58,506 --> 02:15:03,466
I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, indeed distract.

2207
02:15:03,466 --> 02:15:05,706
Her mood will needs be pitied.

2208
02:15:05,706 --> 02:15:09,066
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father,

2209
02:15:09,066 --> 02:15:12,226
says she hears there's tricks i'
the world, speaks things in doubt,

2210
02:15:12,226 --> 02:15:15,266
that carry but half sense.
Her speech is nothing,

2211
02:15:15,266 --> 02:15:18,666
yet the unshaped use of it doth
move the hearers to collection.

2212
02:15:18,666 --> 02:15:21,026
'Twere good she was spoken with,

2213
02:15:21,026 --> 02:15:25,746
for she may strew dangerous
conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

2214
02:15:25,746 --> 02:15:27,226
Let her come in.

2215
02:15:30,226 --> 02:15:33,346
To my sick soul,

2216
02:15:33,346 --> 02:15:39,066
as sin's true nature is, each toy
seems prologue to some great amiss.

2217
02:15:40,626 --> 02:15:43,786
So full of artless jealousy
is guilt,

2218
02:15:43,786 --> 02:15:47,186
it spills itself
in fearing to be spilt.

2219
02:15:47,186 --> 02:15:49,706
Where is the beauteous
majesty of Denmark?

2220
02:15:51,266 --> 02:15:53,426
How now, Ophelia!

2221
02:15:53,426 --> 02:15:59,506
# How should your true love know

2222
02:15:59,506 --> 02:16:03,786
# From another one?

2223
02:16:03,786 --> 02:16:07,066
# By his cockle hat and staff

2224
02:16:07,066 --> 02:16:11,066
# And his sandal shoon... #

2225
02:16:11,066 --> 02:16:14,946
Alas, sweet lady,
what imports this song?

2226
02:16:14,946 --> 02:16:17,586
Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.

2227
02:16:19,146 --> 02:16:22,266
# He is dead and gone, lady

2228
02:16:23,826 --> 02:16:26,546
# He is dead and gone

2229
02:16:28,226 --> 02:16:31,186
# At his head a grass-green turf

2230
02:16:31,186 --> 02:16:33,866
# At his heels a stone... #

2231
02:16:33,866 --> 02:16:36,186
Nay, but, Ophelia... PRAY YOU, MARK!

2232
02:16:37,906 --> 02:16:42,386
# White his shroud
as the mountain snow

2233
02:16:44,066 --> 02:16:47,106
# Larded with sweet flowers

2234
02:16:49,626 --> 02:16:54,866
# Which bewept to the grave
did not go

2235
02:16:54,866 --> 02:16:58,586
# With true-love showers. #

2236
02:16:58,866 --> 02:17:03,026
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God 'ild you!

2237
02:17:03,026 --> 02:17:06,066
They say the owl
was a baker's daughter.

2238
02:17:10,426 --> 02:17:14,426
O Lord, we know what we are,

2239
02:17:17,066 --> 02:17:19,426
but know not what we may be.

2240
02:17:22,706 --> 02:17:24,826
God be at your table!

2241
02:17:26,426 --> 02:17:29,666
Conceit upon her father. Pray you,
let's have no words of this.

2242
02:17:29,666 --> 02:17:32,346
But when they ask you what
it means, say you this -

2243
02:17:32,346 --> 02:17:34,746
# Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day

2244
02:17:34,746 --> 02:17:36,466
# All in the morning betime

2245
02:17:36,466 --> 02:17:38,666
# And I a maid at your window

2246
02:17:38,666 --> 02:17:40,066
# To be your valentine

2247
02:17:40,066 --> 02:17:42,346
# Then up he rose
and donn'd his clothes

2248
02:17:42,346 --> 02:17:44,106
# And dupp'd the chamber-door

2249
02:17:44,106 --> 02:17:47,866
# Let in the maid
that out a maid never departed more

2250
02:17:49,066 --> 02:17:50,866
# I'll make an end on't

2251
02:17:50,866 --> 02:17:53,026
# By Gis and by Saint Charity

2252
02:17:53,026 --> 02:17:55,186
# Alack, and fie for shame!

2253
02:17:55,186 --> 02:17:57,946
# Young men will do't,
if they come to't

2254
02:17:57,946 --> 02:18:00,546
# By cock, they are to blame

2255
02:18:00,546 --> 02:18:03,346
# Quoth she, before you tumbled me,

2256
02:18:03,346 --> 02:18:05,426
# You promised me to wed

2257
02:18:05,426 --> 02:18:08,426
# So would I ha' done, by yonder sun

2258
02:18:08,426 --> 02:18:10,786
# An thou hadst not
come to my bed. #

2259
02:18:12,386 --> 02:18:16,026
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.

2260
02:18:16,026 --> 02:18:18,746
We must be patient,

2261
02:18:20,666 --> 02:18:27,946
but I cannot choose but weep,
to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground.

2262
02:18:32,106 --> 02:18:37,586
My brother shall know of it and so
I thank you for your good counsel.

2263
02:18:37,586 --> 02:18:39,186
Come, my coach!

2264
02:18:39,186 --> 02:18:43,026
Good night, ladies,
good night, sweet ladies,
good night, good night.

2265
02:18:45,106 --> 02:18:46,906
Follow her close.

2266
02:18:50,626 --> 02:18:52,946
Give her good watch, I pray you.

2267
02:18:57,346 --> 02:19:01,186
O, this is the poison of deep grief.

2268
02:19:01,186 --> 02:19:07,786
It springs all from her
father's death and now, behold.

2269
02:19:10,066 --> 02:19:13,466
O, Gertrude, Gertrude.

2270
02:19:13,466 --> 02:19:18,426
When sorrows come, they come not
single spies but in battalions.

2271
02:19:18,426 --> 02:19:21,586
First, her father slain.

2272
02:19:21,586 --> 02:19:28,426
Next, your son gone,
and he most violent author
of his own just remove.

2273
02:19:28,426 --> 02:19:32,146
The people muddied,
sick and unwholesome in their

2274
02:19:32,146 --> 02:19:34,986
thoughts and whispers
for good Polonius' death,

2275
02:19:34,986 --> 02:19:39,586
and we have done but greenly,
in hugger-mugger thus to inter him.

2276
02:19:41,186 --> 02:19:43,226
Poor Ophelia,

2277
02:19:43,226 --> 02:19:49,986
divided from herself and her
fair judgment, without the
which we are but pictures,

2278
02:19:51,746 --> 02:19:53,586
or mere beasts.

2279
02:19:55,186 --> 02:19:59,906
Last, and yet as much
containing all of these,

2280
02:19:59,906 --> 02:20:02,986
her brother is in secret
come from France,

2281
02:20:02,986 --> 02:20:06,146
and wants not buzzers
to infect his ear

2282
02:20:06,146 --> 02:20:09,106
with pestilent speeches
of his father's death.

2283
02:20:09,106 --> 02:20:10,106
THUMPING ON DOOR

2284
02:20:10,106 --> 02:20:12,626
Alas, what noise is this?

2285
02:20:12,626 --> 02:20:16,506
Where are my Switzers?
Bid them guard the door.

2286
02:20:16,506 --> 02:20:18,186
Save yourself, my lord.

2287
02:20:18,186 --> 02:20:21,546
Laertes, in a riotous head,
o'erbears your officers.

2288
02:20:21,546 --> 02:20:26,826
The rabble call him lord. They cry,
"Choose we, Laertes shall be king."

2289
02:20:26,826 --> 02:20:30,546
Caps, hands, and tongues
applaud it to the clouds.

2290
02:20:30,546 --> 02:20:32,826
"Laertes shall be king,
Laertes king!"

2291
02:20:32,826 --> 02:20:35,426
How cheerfully on
the false trail they cry!

2292
02:20:35,426 --> 02:20:40,706
O, this is counter,
you false Danish dogs!

2293
02:20:40,706 --> 02:20:42,786
BANGING
The doors are broken.

2294
02:20:42,786 --> 02:20:44,706
O, vile king, give me my father!

2295
02:20:44,706 --> 02:20:45,746
Calmly, good Laertes.

2296
02:20:45,746 --> 02:20:48,626
That drop of blood that's calm
proclaims me bastard.

2297
02:20:48,626 --> 02:20:52,106
What is the cause, Laertes, that
thy rebellion looks so giant-like?

2298
02:20:52,106 --> 02:20:54,306
Let him go, Gertrude.

2299
02:20:54,306 --> 02:20:56,066
Do not fear our person.

2300
02:20:56,066 --> 02:20:58,906
There is such divinity
doth hedge a king,

2301
02:20:58,906 --> 02:21:01,786
that treason can but
peep to what it would,

2302
02:21:01,786 --> 02:21:03,146
acts little of his will.

2303
02:21:03,146 --> 02:21:07,386
Tell me, Laertes, why art thou
thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.

2304
02:21:07,386 --> 02:21:09,906
Speak, man. Where is my father?

2305
02:21:09,906 --> 02:21:11,346
Dead. But not by him.

2306
02:21:11,346 --> 02:21:13,546
Let him demand his fill.
How came he dead?

2307
02:21:13,546 --> 02:21:15,746
I'll not be juggled with.

2308
02:21:15,746 --> 02:21:19,586
To hell, allegiance!
Vows, to the blackest devil!

2309
02:21:19,586 --> 02:21:22,266
Conscience and grace,
to the profoundest pit!

2310
02:21:22,266 --> 02:21:24,146
I dare damnation.

2311
02:21:24,146 --> 02:21:26,946
To this point I stand,
let come what comes,

2312
02:21:26,946 --> 02:21:29,826
only I'll be revenged
most thoroughly for my father.

2313
02:21:29,826 --> 02:21:33,266
Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world's.

2314
02:21:33,266 --> 02:21:37,906
Good Laertes,
if you desire to know the certainty
of your dear father's death,

2315
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:44,106
is't writ in your revenge
that, swoopstake, you will draw both
friend and foe, winner and loser?

2316
02:21:44,106 --> 02:21:46,946
None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?

2317
02:21:46,946 --> 02:21:50,426
To his good friends,
thus wide I'll ope my arms,

2318
02:21:50,426 --> 02:21:54,506
and like the kind life-rendering
pelican, repast them with my blood.

2319
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:58,826
Why, now you speak like a
good child and a true gentleman.

2320
02:21:58,826 --> 02:22:04,546
That I am guiltless of your
dear father's death,
and am most sensibly in grief for it.

2321
02:22:04,546 --> 02:22:08,386
It shall as level to your judgment
pierce as day does to your eye.

2322
02:22:08,386 --> 02:22:11,146
Let her come in.
How now! What noise is that?

2323
02:22:15,786 --> 02:22:18,386
O heat, dry up my brains!

2324
02:22:20,506 --> 02:22:25,666
Tears seven times salt, burn out
the sense and virtue of mine eye!

2325
02:22:25,666 --> 02:22:27,146
O rose of May!

2326
02:22:29,546 --> 02:22:35,346
Dear maid, kind sister,
sweet Ophelia!

2327
02:22:35,346 --> 02:22:39,746
O heavens! Is't possible, a
young maid's wits should be as
mortal as an old man's life?

2328
02:22:39,746 --> 02:22:44,386
# They bore him barefaced
on the bier

2329
02:22:45,946 --> 02:22:50,266
# Hey, nonny nonny, nonny, no

2330
02:22:52,066 --> 02:22:58,786
# And in his grave
rain'd many a tear

2331
02:23:00,306 --> 02:23:04,026
# Fare you well, my dove! #

2332
02:23:04,026 --> 02:23:07,826
Hadst thou thy wits,
and didst persuade revenge,
it could not move thus.

2333
02:23:07,826 --> 02:23:11,546
(You must sing a-down a-down,
an' you call him a down...) This
nothing's more than matter.

2334
02:23:11,546 --> 02:23:13,946
There's rosemary,

2335
02:23:15,506 --> 02:23:18,786
that's for remembrance.

2336
02:23:18,786 --> 02:23:22,066
Pray, love, remember.

2337
02:23:26,506 --> 02:23:29,226
And there is pansies.

2338
02:23:29,226 --> 02:23:30,786
That's for thoughts.

2339
02:23:32,506 --> 02:23:35,306
A document in madness,

2340
02:23:35,306 --> 02:23:37,586
thoughts and remembrance fitted.

2341
02:23:40,066 --> 02:23:41,786
There's fennel for you,

2342
02:23:41,786 --> 02:23:43,506
and columbines.

2343
02:23:46,946 --> 02:23:48,586
There's rue for you,

2344
02:23:50,466 --> 02:23:52,306
and here's some for me.

2345
02:23:54,666 --> 02:23:56,986
We may call it

2346
02:23:56,986 --> 02:23:58,786
herb-grace o' Sundays.

2347
02:24:01,986 --> 02:24:05,146
O, you must wear your rue
with a difference.

2348
02:24:10,986 --> 02:24:12,506
There's a daisy.

2349
02:24:14,106 --> 02:24:17,026
I would give you some violets,

2350
02:24:17,026 --> 02:24:19,066
but they withered

2351
02:24:19,066 --> 02:24:20,666
all

2352
02:24:20,666 --> 02:24:22,706
when my father died.

2353
02:24:26,986 --> 02:24:28,866
They say he made a good end.

2354
02:24:31,146 --> 02:24:36,786
# For bonny sweet Robin
is all my joy... #

2355
02:24:36,786 --> 02:24:41,306
Thought and affliction, passion,

2356
02:24:41,306 --> 02:24:44,866
hell itself, she turns to
favour and to prettiness.

2357
02:24:46,546 --> 02:24:51,226
# And will he not come again?

2358
02:24:52,626 --> 02:24:57,786
# And will he not come again?

2359
02:24:59,866 --> 02:25:03,386
# No, no, he is dead

2360
02:25:03,386 --> 02:25:07,586
# Go to thy death-bed

2361
02:25:07,586 --> 02:25:11,786
# He never will come again

2362
02:25:13,386 --> 02:25:17,786
# His beard was as white as snow

2363
02:25:19,346 --> 02:25:25,146
# All flaxen was his poll

2364
02:25:27,426 --> 02:25:31,426
# He is gone, he is gone... #

2365
02:25:34,826 --> 02:25:36,306
And we cast away moan

2366
02:25:38,506 --> 02:25:40,426
God ha' mercy on his soul!

2367
02:25:42,346 --> 02:25:47,146
And of all Christian souls,
I pray God.

2368
02:25:50,426 --> 02:25:52,586
God be wi' ye.

2369
02:25:52,586 --> 02:25:56,866
Do you see this, O God?

2370
02:25:56,866 --> 02:25:58,666
Laertes.

2371
02:26:04,026 --> 02:26:09,466
I must commune with your grief,
or you deny me right.

2372
02:26:09,466 --> 02:26:14,466
Go but apart, make choice
of whom your wisest friends you will.

2373
02:26:14,466 --> 02:26:18,986
And they shall hear and judge
'twixt you and me

2374
02:26:18,986 --> 02:26:22,186
if by direct or by collateral hand

2375
02:26:22,186 --> 02:26:27,626
they find us touch'd,
we will our kingdom give, our crown,

2376
02:26:27,626 --> 02:26:31,506
our life, yea all that we call ours,

2377
02:26:31,506 --> 02:26:34,386
to you in satisfaction.

2378
02:26:34,386 --> 02:26:36,946
But if not,

2379
02:26:36,946 --> 02:26:40,626
be you content
to lend your patience to us,

2380
02:26:40,626 --> 02:26:45,706
and we will jointly labour with
your soul to give it due content.

2381
02:26:48,466 --> 02:26:49,946
Let this be so.

2382
02:26:53,426 --> 02:26:56,666
And where the offence is,

2383
02:26:56,666 --> 02:27:00,946
let the great axe fall.

2384
02:27:00,946 --> 02:27:03,266
Go, captain,
from me greet the Danish king.

2385
02:27:03,266 --> 02:27:08,026
Tell him that, by his licence,
Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of
a promised march over his kingdom.

2386
02:27:08,026 --> 02:27:10,226
I will do so, my lord. Go safely on.

2387
02:27:16,706 --> 02:27:20,026
Sir, whose powers are these?

2388
02:27:20,026 --> 02:27:22,506
They are of Norway, sir.

2389
02:27:22,506 --> 02:27:24,506
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

2390
02:27:24,506 --> 02:27:27,306
Against some part of Poland.

2391
02:27:27,306 --> 02:27:29,386
Who commands them, sir?

2392
02:27:29,386 --> 02:27:32,466
The nephew to old Norway,
Fortinbras.

2393
02:27:32,466 --> 02:27:36,506
Goes it against the main of
Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?

2394
02:27:36,506 --> 02:27:41,026
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch

2395
02:27:41,026 --> 02:27:43,946
of ground that hath in
it no profit but the name.

2396
02:27:43,946 --> 02:27:47,546
To pay five ducats, five,
I would not farm it.

2397
02:27:47,546 --> 02:27:49,866
Why, then the Polack
never will defend it.

2398
02:27:49,866 --> 02:27:52,706
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

2399
02:27:52,706 --> 02:27:59,586
Two thousand souls and
20,000 ducats will not debate
the question of this straw.

2400
02:27:59,586 --> 02:28:01,546
I humbly thank you, sir.

2401
02:28:01,546 --> 02:28:03,226
God be wi' you, sir.

2402
02:28:22,386 --> 02:28:26,586
How all occasions
do inform against me,

2403
02:28:26,586 --> 02:28:29,466
and spur my dull revenge.

2404
02:28:32,426 --> 02:28:38,346
I do not know why yet I live to say
"This thing's to do,"

2405
02:28:38,346 --> 02:28:40,106
Sith I have cause

2406
02:28:40,106 --> 02:28:42,026
and will

2407
02:28:42,026 --> 02:28:45,186
and strength and means to do't.

2408
02:28:47,066 --> 02:28:50,146
Examples gross as earth
exhort me.

2409
02:28:50,146 --> 02:28:55,226
Witness this army
of such mass and charge

2410
02:28:55,226 --> 02:28:59,826
led by a delicate
and tender prince,

2411
02:28:59,826 --> 02:29:04,146
whose spirit with
divine ambition puff'd

2412
02:29:04,146 --> 02:29:07,866
makes mouths at the invisible event,

2413
02:29:07,866 --> 02:29:12,706
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune,

2414
02:29:12,706 --> 02:29:14,466
death and danger dare,

2415
02:29:18,266 --> 02:29:20,186
even for an egg-shell.

2416
02:29:25,426 --> 02:29:27,386
O, from this time forth,

2417
02:29:30,266 --> 02:29:32,506
My thoughts be bloody,

2418
02:29:34,386 --> 02:29:36,386
or be nothing worth!

2419
02:29:50,826 --> 02:29:53,066
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

2420
02:29:53,066 --> 02:29:57,346
Or are you but the painting of
a sorrow, a face without a heart?

2421
02:29:57,346 --> 02:29:58,786
Why ask you this?

2422
02:30:00,306 --> 02:30:02,786
Hamlet comes back.

2423
02:30:03,786 --> 02:30:05,386
What will you undertake,

2424
02:30:05,386 --> 02:30:09,346
to prove yourself your father's son
in deed more than in words?

2425
02:30:11,066 --> 02:30:13,746
To cut his throat i' the church.

2426
02:30:15,866 --> 02:30:18,386
No place, indeed,
should murder sanctuarize,

2427
02:30:19,986 --> 02:30:22,146
Revenge should know no bounds.

2428
02:30:27,346 --> 02:30:31,386
But, good Laertes, will you do this,
stay close within your chamber.

2429
02:30:31,386 --> 02:30:34,146
Hamlet return'd shall
know you are come home.

2430
02:30:34,146 --> 02:30:38,226
We'll set on those who'll
praise your excellence,

2431
02:30:38,226 --> 02:30:44,386
and for your rapier
most especially, bring you in fine
together and wager on your heads.

2432
02:30:44,386 --> 02:30:48,426
He, being remiss,
and free from all contriving,

2433
02:30:48,426 --> 02:30:51,746
will not peruse the foils, so that,

2434
02:30:51,746 --> 02:30:55,026
with ease, or a little shuffling,

2435
02:30:55,026 --> 02:30:58,506
you may choose a sword unblunted,

2436
02:30:58,506 --> 02:31:02,186
and in a pass of practise
requite him for your father.

2437
02:31:02,186 --> 02:31:03,666
I will do it.

2438
02:31:05,426 --> 02:31:10,186
And, for that purpose,
I'll anoint my sword.

2439
02:31:10,186 --> 02:31:13,226
I bought an unction of a mountebank

2440
02:31:13,226 --> 02:31:15,426
so mortal that,
but dip a knife in it,

2441
02:31:15,426 --> 02:31:17,706
where it draws blood
no cataplasm so rare

2442
02:31:17,706 --> 02:31:20,866
can save the thing from death
that's scratch'd withal.

2443
02:31:20,866 --> 02:31:26,346
I'll touch my point with this
contagion, that, if I but gall him
slightly, it may be his death.

2444
02:31:27,746 --> 02:31:30,506
Hm. Let's further think on this.

2445
02:31:32,146 --> 02:31:35,866
If this should fail
and that our drift look through
our bad performance,

2446
02:31:35,866 --> 02:31:37,426
'twere better not assay'd.

2447
02:31:37,426 --> 02:31:42,546
Therefore this plot should have a
back or second, that might hold,
if this did blast in proof.

2448
02:31:42,546 --> 02:31:44,346
Soft!

2449
02:31:46,186 --> 02:31:47,786
I ha't.

2450
02:31:47,786 --> 02:31:53,146
When in your motion you
are hot and dry - as make your
bout more violent to that end -

2451
02:31:53,146 --> 02:31:55,506
and that he calls for drink,

2452
02:31:55,506 --> 02:32:00,826
I'll have prepared him a chalice
for the nonce, whereon but sipping,

2453
02:32:00,826 --> 02:32:06,146
if, by chance, he escape your venom'd
stuck, our purpose will hold there.

2454
02:32:08,586 --> 02:32:10,346
How now, sweet queen?

2455
02:32:10,346 --> 02:32:15,786
One woe doth tread upon
another's heel, so fast they follow.

2456
02:32:15,786 --> 02:32:18,506
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

2457
02:32:20,866 --> 02:32:25,546
Drown'd? Where?

2458
02:32:27,586 --> 02:32:30,226
There is a willow

2459
02:32:30,226 --> 02:32:32,986
grows aslant a brook,

2460
02:32:32,986 --> 02:32:36,506
that shows his hoar leaves
in the glassy stream.

2461
02:32:36,506 --> 02:32:40,546
There with fantastic garlands
did she come

2462
02:32:40,546 --> 02:32:43,786
of crow-flowers, nettles,

2463
02:32:43,786 --> 02:32:48,746
daisies, and long purples - that
liberal shepherds
give a grosser name -

2464
02:32:48,746 --> 02:32:52,066
but our cold maids
do dead men's fingers call them.

2465
02:32:55,106 --> 02:32:59,946
There, on the pendent boughs her
coronet weeds clambering to hang,

2466
02:32:59,946 --> 02:33:02,066
an envious sliver broke,

2467
02:33:02,066 --> 02:33:05,986
when down her
weedy trophies and herself

2468
02:33:05,986 --> 02:33:08,346
fell in the weeping brook.

2469
02:33:08,346 --> 02:33:10,146
Her clothes

2470
02:33:10,146 --> 02:33:12,186
spread wide, and,

2471
02:33:13,786 --> 02:33:17,146
mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up,

2472
02:33:17,146 --> 02:33:21,066
which time she chanted
snatches of old tunes,

2473
02:33:21,066 --> 02:33:25,426
as one incapable
of her own distress,

2474
02:33:25,426 --> 02:33:29,786
or like a creature native
and indued Unto that element,

2475
02:33:29,786 --> 02:33:33,626
but long it could not be

2476
02:33:33,626 --> 02:33:36,946
till that her garments,
heavy with their drink,

2477
02:33:36,946 --> 02:33:39,586
Pull'd the poor wretch from her

2478
02:33:39,586 --> 02:33:41,346
melodious lay

2479
02:33:43,466 --> 02:33:47,106
to muddy death.
Alas, then, she is drown'd?

2480
02:33:47,106 --> 02:33:50,746
Drown'd.

2481
02:33:50,746 --> 02:33:53,386
Drown'd.

2482
02:34:00,546 --> 02:34:04,106
Too much of water hast
thou, poor Ophelia,

2483
02:34:04,106 --> 02:34:06,266
and therefore,

2484
02:34:06,266 --> 02:34:09,146
I forbid my tears, but yet...

2485
02:34:09,146 --> 02:34:10,706
It is our trick,

2486
02:34:13,066 --> 02:34:18,626
nature her custom holds, let shame
say what it will. Adieu, my lord.

2487
02:34:18,626 --> 02:34:22,786
I have a speech of fire,
that fain would blaze,

2488
02:34:24,826 --> 02:34:27,146
but that this folly douses it.

2489
02:34:31,226 --> 02:34:33,546
Let's follow, Gertrude.

2490
02:34:33,546 --> 02:34:37,626
How much I had to do
to calm his rage.

2491
02:34:37,626 --> 02:34:41,066
Now fear I
this will give it start again.

2492
02:34:46,306 --> 02:34:48,866
Is she to be buried
in Christian burial

2493
02:34:48,866 --> 02:34:51,826
that wilfully
seeks her own salvation?

2494
02:34:51,826 --> 02:34:53,506
I tell thee, she is.

2495
02:34:53,506 --> 02:34:55,826
And, therefore,
make her grave straight.

2496
02:34:55,826 --> 02:35:01,986
Well, how can that be, unless she
drowned herself in her own defence?

2497
02:35:01,986 --> 02:35:03,706
Why, 'tis found so.

2498
02:35:03,706 --> 02:35:05,906
It must be se offendendo,

2499
02:35:05,906 --> 02:35:09,146
it cannot be else.
For here lies the point.

2500
02:35:09,146 --> 02:35:12,626
If I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act.

2501
02:35:12,626 --> 02:35:14,986
And an act hath three branches.

2502
02:35:14,986 --> 02:35:17,026
It is, to act, to do, to perform.

2503
02:35:17,026 --> 02:35:19,026
Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.

2504
02:35:19,026 --> 02:35:23,746
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.
Give me leave.
Here lies the water, good.

2505
02:35:23,746 --> 02:35:26,706
Here stands the man, good.

2506
02:35:26,706 --> 02:35:32,706
If the man go to this water, and
drown himself, it is, will he,
nill he, he goes, mark you that.

2507
02:35:32,706 --> 02:35:37,386
But if the water come to him and
drown him, he drowns not himself.

2508
02:35:37,386 --> 02:35:41,506
Argal, he that is not guilty of his
own death shortens not his own life.

2509
02:35:41,506 --> 02:35:45,946
Cudgel thy brains no more about it.

2510
02:35:47,546 --> 02:35:49,386
Go, get thee to Yaughan.

2511
02:35:49,386 --> 02:35:50,906
Fetch me a stoup of liquor.

2512
02:35:54,586 --> 02:35:58,506
# In youth, when I did love,
did love

2513
02:35:58,506 --> 02:36:01,826
# Methought it was very sweet... #

2514
02:36:01,826 --> 02:36:05,786
Has this fellow no
feeling of his business,
that he sings at grave-making?

2515
02:36:05,786 --> 02:36:09,906
Custom hath made it in him a
property of easiness. Tis e'en so.

2516
02:36:13,106 --> 02:36:16,306
That skull had a tongue in it,
and could sing once.

2517
02:36:16,306 --> 02:36:21,706
How the knave jowls it to the
ground, as if it were Cain's
jaw-bone, that did the first murder!

2518
02:36:24,626 --> 02:36:26,866
It might be the
pate of a politician,

2519
02:36:28,426 --> 02:36:31,906
one that would circumvent God,
might it not? It might, my lord.

2520
02:36:31,906 --> 02:36:34,466
And now my Lady Worm's,

2521
02:36:34,466 --> 02:36:36,706
chapless,

2522
02:36:36,706 --> 02:36:39,346
and knocked about the mazzard
with a sexton's spade.

2523
02:36:41,146 --> 02:36:43,866
Here's fine revolution,
an' we had the trick to see't.

2524
02:36:46,546 --> 02:36:49,146
There's another.

2525
02:36:49,146 --> 02:36:51,626
Why, may not that be
the skull of a lawyer?

2526
02:36:54,346 --> 02:36:56,986
Where be his quiddities now,

2527
02:36:56,986 --> 02:36:59,106
his quillets, his tricks?

2528
02:37:00,706 --> 02:37:05,386
Why does he suffer this rude knave
now to knock him about the sconce
with a dirty shovel,

2529
02:37:05,386 --> 02:37:07,986
and will not tell him
of his action of battery? Eh?

2530
02:37:09,666 --> 02:37:11,506
I'll speak to this fellow.

2531
02:37:11,506 --> 02:37:13,786
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

2532
02:37:13,786 --> 02:37:15,506
Mine, sir.

2533
02:37:15,506 --> 02:37:19,186
# O, a pit of clay for to be made

2534
02:37:19,186 --> 02:37:21,266
# For such a guest is meet... #

2535
02:37:21,266 --> 02:37:23,746
I think it be thine,
indeed, for thou liest in't.

2536
02:37:23,746 --> 02:37:26,706
Thou lie out of it, sir,
and therefore it is not yours.

2537
02:37:26,706 --> 02:37:30,546
For my part, I do not
lie in't, and yet it is mine.

2538
02:37:30,546 --> 02:37:33,186
Thou dost lie in't,
to be in't and say it is thine.

2539
02:37:33,186 --> 02:37:36,106
'Tis for the dead, not for the
quick, therefore thou liest.

2540
02:37:36,106 --> 02:37:40,986
Tis a quick lie, sir,
'twill away gain, from me to you.

2541
02:37:40,986 --> 02:37:43,106
What man dost thou dig it for?

2542
02:37:43,106 --> 02:37:44,866
For no man, sir.

2543
02:37:44,866 --> 02:37:46,346
What woman, then?

2544
02:37:46,346 --> 02:37:48,066
For none, neither.

2545
02:37:48,066 --> 02:37:50,226
Who is to be buried in't?

2546
02:37:50,226 --> 02:37:54,426
One that was a woman, sir,
but, rest her soul, she's dead.

2547
02:37:55,586 --> 02:37:58,386
How absolute the knave is!

2548
02:37:58,386 --> 02:38:00,786
How long hast thou
been a grave-maker?

2549
02:38:00,786 --> 02:38:06,626
Of all the days i' the year,
I came to't that day that our last
king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

2550
02:38:06,626 --> 02:38:08,186
How long is that since?

2551
02:38:08,186 --> 02:38:09,986
Cannot you tell that?

2552
02:38:09,986 --> 02:38:12,146
Every fool can tell that.

2553
02:38:12,146 --> 02:38:16,746
It was the very day that young
Hamlet was born, he that is mad,
and sent into England.

2554
02:38:16,746 --> 02:38:18,986
Ay, marry,
why was he sent into England?

2555
02:38:18,986 --> 02:38:21,746
Why, because he was mad.

2556
02:38:21,746 --> 02:38:26,226
He shall recover his wits there,
or, if he do not, it's
no great matter there. Why?

2557
02:38:26,226 --> 02:38:29,826
'Twill, a not be seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.

2558
02:38:30,986 --> 02:38:33,866
How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.

2559
02:38:33,866 --> 02:38:36,986
How strangely?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

2560
02:38:36,986 --> 02:38:40,626
Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.

2561
02:38:44,506 --> 02:38:48,786
I have been sexton here,
man and boy, 30 years.

2562
02:38:48,786 --> 02:38:51,906
How long will a man lie
i' the earth ere he rot?

2563
02:38:51,906 --> 02:38:55,426
I' faith,
if he be not rotten before he die -

2564
02:38:55,426 --> 02:38:57,266
as we have many pocky corpses
now a days,

2565
02:38:57,266 --> 02:38:59,106
that will scarce hold the laying in -

2566
02:38:59,106 --> 02:39:02,106
he will last you
some eight year or nine year.

2567
02:39:02,106 --> 02:39:03,746
A tanner will last you nine year.

2568
02:39:03,746 --> 02:39:05,466
Why he more than another?

2569
02:39:05,466 --> 02:39:08,026
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned
with his trade,

2570
02:39:08,026 --> 02:39:10,666
that he will
keep out water a great while,

2571
02:39:10,666 --> 02:39:14,666
and your water is a sore decayer
of your whoreson dead body.

2572
02:39:14,666 --> 02:39:17,266
Here's a skull, sir.

2573
02:39:17,266 --> 02:39:19,426
I've lain you in the earth

2574
02:39:19,426 --> 02:39:22,026
three and 20 years. Whose was it?

2575
02:39:23,706 --> 02:39:27,826
A whoreson mad fellow, he was.
Whose do you think it was?

2576
02:39:27,826 --> 02:39:31,226
Nay, I know not.

2577
02:39:31,226 --> 02:39:34,346
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!

2578
02:39:34,346 --> 02:39:37,906
He poured a flagon of
Rhenish on my head once.

2579
02:39:37,906 --> 02:39:44,106
This same skull, sir, was
Yorick's skull, the king's jester.

2580
02:39:44,106 --> 02:39:49,226
This? E'en that. Let me see.

2581
02:39:54,626 --> 02:39:58,306
Alas, poor Yorick!

2582
02:39:58,306 --> 02:40:00,266
I knew him, Horatio.

2583
02:40:02,826 --> 02:40:05,106
A fellow of infinite jest,

2584
02:40:07,266 --> 02:40:14,026
of most excellent fancy.
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,

2585
02:40:15,626 --> 02:40:18,026
and now,

2586
02:40:18,026 --> 02:40:20,426
how abhorred in my
imagination it is!

2587
02:40:22,026 --> 02:40:23,946
My gorge rises at it.

2588
02:40:27,226 --> 02:40:31,346
Here hung those lips
that I have kissed

2589
02:40:31,346 --> 02:40:33,746
I know not how oft.

2590
02:40:33,746 --> 02:40:36,426
Where be your gibes now?

2591
02:40:36,426 --> 02:40:39,106
Your gambols? Your songs?

2592
02:40:39,106 --> 02:40:44,026
Your flashes of merriment, that were
wont to set the table on a roar?

2593
02:40:44,026 --> 02:40:47,066
Not one now, to mock
your own grinning.

2594
02:40:47,066 --> 02:40:49,666
Quite chap-fallen.

2595
02:40:49,666 --> 02:40:54,066
Now get you to my lady's chamber,
and tell her,

2596
02:40:54,066 --> 02:40:57,026
let her paint an inch thick,

2597
02:40:57,026 --> 02:40:59,266
to this favour she must come.

2598
02:41:00,866 --> 02:41:02,466
Make her laugh at that.

2599
02:41:06,906 --> 02:41:09,146
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

2600
02:41:09,146 --> 02:41:11,786
What's that, my lord?

2601
02:41:11,786 --> 02:41:16,466
Dost thou think Alexander looked o'
this fashion i' the earth? E'en so.

2602
02:41:16,466 --> 02:41:20,146
And smelt so? Whoo!
E'en so, my lord.

2603
02:41:20,146 --> 02:41:22,426
Imperious Caesar,

2604
02:41:22,426 --> 02:41:25,386
dead and turn'd to clay,

2605
02:41:25,386 --> 02:41:27,746
Might stop a hole to
keep the wind away.

2606
02:41:27,746 --> 02:41:31,466
'Twere to consider too
curiously to consider so.

2607
02:41:31,466 --> 02:41:32,986
Not a jot.

2608
02:41:32,986 --> 02:41:34,106
BELLS CHIME

2609
02:41:50,346 --> 02:41:51,986
Here comes the king.

2610
02:41:53,946 --> 02:41:56,866
The queen, the courtiers.
Who is this they follow?

2611
02:41:58,026 --> 02:42:01,866
And with such maimed
rites this doth betoken

2612
02:42:01,866 --> 02:42:05,386
the corse they follow did, with
desperate hand, foredo its own life.

2613
02:42:09,626 --> 02:42:11,826
'Twas of some estate.

2614
02:42:11,826 --> 02:42:13,306
Couch we awhile, and mark.

2615
02:42:19,906 --> 02:42:23,066
What ceremony else? That is Laertes.

2616
02:42:23,066 --> 02:42:25,106
What ceremony else?

2617
02:42:25,106 --> 02:42:29,186
Her obsequies have been as far
enlarged as we have warranty.

2618
02:42:29,186 --> 02:42:31,306
Her death was doubtful.

2619
02:42:31,306 --> 02:42:34,826
And, but that great command
o'ersways the order,

2620
02:42:34,826 --> 02:42:39,186
she should in ground unsanctified
have lodged till the last trumpet.

2621
02:42:39,186 --> 02:42:42,186
Must there no more be done?
No more be done.

2622
02:42:42,186 --> 02:42:44,826
We should profane
the service of the dead

2623
02:42:44,826 --> 02:42:49,986
to sing a requiem and such rest
to her as to peace-parted souls.

2624
02:42:49,986 --> 02:42:51,466
Lay her i' the earth.

2625
02:43:10,946 --> 02:43:14,386
And from her fair and unpolluted
flesh may violets spring!

2626
02:43:14,386 --> 02:43:15,946
I tell thee, churlish priest,

2627
02:43:15,946 --> 02:43:20,826
a ministering angel shall my sister
be, when thou liest howling.

2628
02:43:20,826 --> 02:43:22,506
What, the fair Ophelia!

2629
02:43:22,506 --> 02:43:25,826
Sweets to the sweet.

2630
02:43:25,826 --> 02:43:27,306
Farewell!

2631
02:43:29,386 --> 02:43:33,306
I hoped thou shouldst have
been my Hamlet's wife.

2632
02:43:33,306 --> 02:43:37,346
I thought thy bride-bed
to have deck'd, sweet maid,

2633
02:43:37,346 --> 02:43:40,026
not have strew'd thy grave.

2634
02:43:40,026 --> 02:43:44,826
O, treble woe, fall ten times
treble on that cursed head,

2635
02:43:44,826 --> 02:43:49,986
whose wicked deed thy most
ingenious sense deprived thee of.

2636
02:43:49,986 --> 02:43:51,506
Hold off the earth awhile.

2637
02:43:53,746 --> 02:43:56,146
Till I have caught her
once more in mine arms.

2638
02:44:03,066 --> 02:44:06,306
Now pile your dust
upon the quick and dead,

2639
02:44:06,306 --> 02:44:09,906
till of this flat
a mountain you have made,

2640
02:44:09,906 --> 02:44:14,826
to o'ertop old Pelion,
or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.

2641
02:44:14,826 --> 02:44:18,906
What is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis?

2642
02:44:18,906 --> 02:44:22,466
Whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars,

2643
02:44:22,466 --> 02:44:26,546
and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers?

2644
02:44:26,546 --> 02:44:28,906
This is I,

2645
02:44:28,906 --> 02:44:31,706
Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!

2646
02:44:31,706 --> 02:44:35,746
Thou pray'st not well. I prithee,
take thy fingers from my throat.

2647
02:44:35,746 --> 02:44:38,946
For, though I am not splenitive
and rash, yet have I
something in me dangerous,

2648
02:44:38,946 --> 02:44:42,226
which let thy wiseness fear.
Hold off thy hand!

2649
02:44:42,226 --> 02:44:47,786
Pluck them asunder. Hamlet, Hamlet!
Gentlemen. Good my lord, be quiet.

2650
02:44:47,786 --> 02:44:51,146
Why I will fight with him
upon this theme until my
eyelids will no longer wag.

2651
02:44:51,146 --> 02:44:53,026
O my son, what theme?

2652
02:44:56,066 --> 02:44:57,706
I loved Ophelia.

2653
02:44:59,426 --> 02:45:03,106
Forty thousand brothers could not,
with all their quantity of love,

2654
02:45:03,106 --> 02:45:05,746
make up my sum.
What wilt thou do for her?

2655
02:45:05,746 --> 02:45:07,546
O, he is mad, Laertes.

2656
02:45:07,546 --> 02:45:09,706
For love of God, forbear him.

2657
02:45:09,706 --> 02:45:12,146
Swounds,
show me what thou'lt do. Woo't weep?

2658
02:45:12,146 --> 02:45:14,346
Woo't fight? Woo't fast?

2659
02:45:14,346 --> 02:45:15,946
Woo't tear thyself?

2660
02:45:15,946 --> 02:45:18,146
Woo't drink up eisel?

2661
02:45:18,146 --> 02:45:20,346
Eat a crocodile? I'll do't.

2662
02:45:21,946 --> 02:45:25,066
Dost thou come here to whine?

2663
02:45:25,066 --> 02:45:28,466
To outface me with
leaping in her grave?

2664
02:45:28,466 --> 02:45:31,146
Be buried quick with
her, and so will I.

2665
02:45:32,546 --> 02:45:37,986
And, if thou prate of mountains, let
them throw millions of acres on us,

2666
02:45:37,986 --> 02:45:40,826
till our ground, singeing his pate

2667
02:45:40,826 --> 02:45:44,906
against the burning zone,
make Ossa like a wart!

2668
02:45:44,906 --> 02:45:49,546
Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.

2669
02:45:49,546 --> 02:45:54,146
This is mere madness. And thus
awhile the fit will work on him.

2670
02:45:54,146 --> 02:45:57,506
Anon, his silence will sit drooping.

2671
02:45:59,546 --> 02:46:00,586
Hear you, sir.

2672
02:46:00,586 --> 02:46:04,146
What is the reason
that you use me thus?

2673
02:46:04,146 --> 02:46:05,586
I loved you ever.

2674
02:46:08,826 --> 02:46:10,546
But it is no matter.

2675
02:46:13,266 --> 02:46:16,266
Let Hercules himself do what he may,

2676
02:46:18,546 --> 02:46:20,586
the cat will mew

2677
02:46:22,946 --> 02:46:25,906
and dog will have his day.

2678
02:46:28,386 --> 02:46:31,146
Good Horatio, wait upon him.

2679
02:46:36,146 --> 02:46:39,026
Strengthen your patience
in our last night's speech.

2680
02:46:39,026 --> 02:46:41,426
We'll put the matter
to the present push.

2681
02:46:41,426 --> 02:46:43,146
Good Gertrude,

2682
02:46:43,146 --> 02:46:45,466
set some watch over your son.

2683
02:46:52,946 --> 02:46:56,346
There's a divinity
that shapes our ends,

2684
02:46:56,346 --> 02:46:59,506
rough-hew them how we will.

2685
02:46:59,506 --> 02:47:01,106
That is most certain.

2686
02:47:03,866 --> 02:47:05,906
Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are dead.

2687
02:47:05,906 --> 02:47:09,346
Why, man, they did make love
to this employment, they
are not near my conscience.

2688
02:47:09,346 --> 02:47:13,466
Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think'st thee,
stand me now upon?

2689
02:47:15,106 --> 02:47:18,426
He that hath kill'd my
king and whored my mother,

2690
02:47:18,426 --> 02:47:20,986
popp'd in between the
election and my hopes,

2691
02:47:20,986 --> 02:47:24,106
thrown out his angle
for my proper life,

2692
02:47:24,106 --> 02:47:28,906
and with such cozenage is't not
perfect conscience,
to quit him with this arm?

2693
02:47:30,946 --> 02:47:34,746
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
that to Laertes I forgot myself.

2694
02:47:36,346 --> 02:47:41,386
For, by the image of my cause,
I see the portraiture of his.

2695
02:47:41,386 --> 02:47:43,106
I'll court his favours.

2696
02:47:44,706 --> 02:47:48,586
But, sure, the bravery of his grief
did put me into a towering passion.

2697
02:47:48,586 --> 02:47:52,586
Peace! who comes here? Your lordship
is right welcome back to Denmark.

2698
02:47:52,586 --> 02:47:54,746
I humbly thank you, sir.

2699
02:47:54,746 --> 02:47:57,626
Dost know this water-fly?
No, my lord.

2700
02:47:57,626 --> 02:48:00,586
Thy state is the more gracious,
for 'tis a vice to know him.

2701
02:48:00,586 --> 02:48:02,786
'Tis a chough.

2702
02:48:02,786 --> 02:48:06,866
Sweet lord, if your lordship were
at leisure, I should impart a
thing to you from his majesty.

2703
02:48:06,866 --> 02:48:09,106
I will receive it, sir,
with all diligence of spirit.

2704
02:48:09,106 --> 02:48:12,546
Put your bonnet to his right
use, 'tis for the head.

2705
02:48:12,546 --> 02:48:14,946
I thank your lordship,
it is very hot.

2706
02:48:14,946 --> 02:48:19,146
No, believe me, 'tis very cold.
The wind is northerly.

2707
02:48:19,146 --> 02:48:21,746
It is indifferent cold,
my lord, indeed.

2708
02:48:21,746 --> 02:48:26,506
But yet methinks it is very
sultry and hot for my complexion.

2709
02:48:26,506 --> 02:48:33,226
Exceedingly, my lord,
it is very sultry, as 'twere,
I cannot tell how.

2710
02:48:33,226 --> 02:48:39,426
But, my lord, his majesty bade
me signify to you that he has
laid a great wager on your head.

2711
02:48:39,426 --> 02:48:42,306
Sir, this is the matter.
I beseech you, remember.

2712
02:48:42,306 --> 02:48:46,466
Nay, good my lord,
for mine ease, in good faith.

2713
02:48:46,466 --> 02:48:48,666
Sir, here is newly come to court
Laertes,

2714
02:48:48,666 --> 02:48:52,946
believe me, an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences,

2715
02:48:52,946 --> 02:48:55,146
of very soft society
and great showing.

2716
02:48:56,746 --> 02:49:00,946
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,
he is the card
or calendar of gentry,

2717
02:49:00,946 --> 02:49:05,586
for you shall find in him
the continent of what
part a gentleman would see.

2718
02:49:07,186 --> 02:49:13,866
The concernancy, sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?

2719
02:49:15,466 --> 02:49:20,186
Sir? What imports the
nomination of this gentleman?

2720
02:49:20,186 --> 02:49:22,786
Of Laertes? Of him, sir.

2721
02:49:24,506 --> 02:49:26,466
I know you are not ignorant.

2722
02:49:26,466 --> 02:49:30,626
I would you did, sir.
Yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not much approve me. Well, sir?

2723
02:49:30,626 --> 02:49:33,146
You are not ignorant of
what excellence Laertes is.

2724
02:49:33,146 --> 02:49:37,946
I dare not confess that,
lest I should compare with him in
excellence, but, to know a man well,

2725
02:49:37,946 --> 02:49:39,506
were to know himself.

2726
02:49:42,746 --> 02:49:48,306
I mean, sir, for his weapon.
But in the imputation laid on him by
them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

2727
02:49:48,306 --> 02:49:50,666
What's his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.

2728
02:49:50,666 --> 02:49:52,986
That's two of his weapons but, well.

2729
02:49:52,986 --> 02:49:57,786
The king, sir, hath wagered
with him six Barbary horses
against the which he has imponed,

2730
02:49:57,786 --> 02:50:03,586
as I take it, six French rapiers
and poniards, with their assigns,
as girdle, hangers, and so.

2731
02:50:03,586 --> 02:50:08,466
Three of the carriages, in faith,
are very dear to fancy,
very responsive to the hilts,

2732
02:50:08,466 --> 02:50:11,706
most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.

2733
02:50:11,706 --> 02:50:14,386
What call you the carriages?

2734
02:50:18,186 --> 02:50:19,986
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

2735
02:50:22,746 --> 02:50:26,866
But, on. Why is this
"imponed", as you call it?

2736
02:50:26,866 --> 02:50:28,506
The king, sir, hath laid,

2737
02:50:28,506 --> 02:50:33,106
that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him,
he shall not exceed you three hits.

2738
02:50:33,106 --> 02:50:37,266
It would come to immediate
trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.

2739
02:50:37,266 --> 02:50:39,186
How if I answer no?

2740
02:50:42,746 --> 02:50:45,866
I mean, sir, the opposition
of your person in trial.

2741
02:50:49,986 --> 02:50:53,866
Sir, I will walk here in the hall
if it please his majesty.

2742
02:50:53,866 --> 02:50:57,706
'Tis the breathing time of day with
me, I will win for him an I can,

2743
02:50:57,706 --> 02:51:00,666
if not, I will gain nothing
but my shame and the odd hits.

2744
02:51:00,666 --> 02:51:03,706
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

2745
02:51:03,706 --> 02:51:07,106
To this effect, sir, after
what flourish your nature will.

2746
02:51:07,106 --> 02:51:09,306
I commend my duty to your lordship.

2747
02:51:09,306 --> 02:51:10,786
Yours, yours.

2748
02:51:13,386 --> 02:51:16,226
This lapwing runs away
with the shell on his head.

2749
02:51:16,226 --> 02:51:19,586
He did comply with his mother's dug,
before he sucked it.

2750
02:51:19,586 --> 02:51:21,306
You will lose this wager, my lord.

2751
02:51:21,306 --> 02:51:25,666
I do not think so.
Since he went into France,
I have been in continual practise.

2752
02:51:25,666 --> 02:51:27,266
I shall win at the odds.

2753
02:51:29,706 --> 02:51:34,226
But thou wouldst not think how
ill all's here about my heart.

2754
02:51:34,226 --> 02:51:36,106
But it is no matter.
Nay, good my lord.

2755
02:51:36,106 --> 02:51:38,706
It is but foolery. If your
mind dislike any thing, obey it.

2756
02:51:38,706 --> 02:51:41,546
I will forestall their repair
hither, and say you are not fit.

2757
02:51:41,546 --> 02:51:44,466
Not a whit.

2758
02:51:44,466 --> 02:51:46,346
We defy augury.

2759
02:51:48,986 --> 02:51:52,066
There's a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

2760
02:51:54,506 --> 02:51:57,386
If it be now, 'tis not to come.

2761
02:51:59,386 --> 02:52:01,386
If it be not to come,
it will be now.

2762
02:52:03,786 --> 02:52:05,426
If it be not now,

2763
02:52:07,226 --> 02:52:08,666
yet it will come.

2764
02:52:12,826 --> 02:52:15,266
The readiness is all.

2765
02:52:15,266 --> 02:52:20,426
Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.

2766
02:52:20,426 --> 02:52:23,266
Give me your pardon, sir.
I've done you wrong.

2767
02:52:23,266 --> 02:52:25,106
But pardon't,
as you are a gentleman.

2768
02:52:25,106 --> 02:52:27,826
This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard,

2769
02:52:27,826 --> 02:52:30,946
how I am punish'd
with sore distraction.

2770
02:52:30,946 --> 02:52:37,426
What I have done, that might your
nature, honour and exception roughly
awake, I here proclaim was madness.

2771
02:52:39,026 --> 02:52:44,226
Sir, in this audience, let
my disclaiming from a purposed evil

2772
02:52:44,226 --> 02:52:47,946
free me so far
in your most generous thoughts,

2773
02:52:47,946 --> 02:52:52,226
that I have shot mine arrow o'er
the house, and hurt my brother.

2774
02:52:52,226 --> 02:52:53,346
I am satisfied.

2775
02:52:53,346 --> 02:52:57,466
I do receive your offer'd love
like love, and will not wrong it.

2776
02:52:57,466 --> 02:52:59,306
I do embrace it freely.

2777
02:52:59,306 --> 02:53:04,946
And will this brother's wager
frankly play. Give us the foils.
Come on. Come, one for me.

2778
02:53:04,946 --> 02:53:08,306
I'll be your foil, Laertes,
in mine ignorance.

2779
02:53:08,306 --> 02:53:14,226
Your skill shall, like a
star i' the darkest night,
stick fiery off indeed.

2780
02:53:14,226 --> 02:53:16,226
You mock me, sir.

2781
02:53:16,226 --> 02:53:17,826
No, by this hand.

2782
02:53:17,826 --> 02:53:20,786
Give them the foils, young Osric.

2783
02:53:20,786 --> 02:53:23,706
Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?

2784
02:53:23,706 --> 02:53:27,066
Very well, my lord. Your grace hath
laid the odds o' the weaker side.

2785
02:53:27,066 --> 02:53:29,546
I do not think it.
I have seen you both.

2786
02:53:29,546 --> 02:53:32,146
But since he is better'd,
we have therefore odds.

2787
02:53:32,146 --> 02:53:34,186
This is too heavy,
let me see another.

2788
02:53:35,666 --> 02:53:37,026
This likes me well enough.

2789
02:53:37,026 --> 02:53:39,706
These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.

2790
02:53:39,706 --> 02:53:42,626
If Hamlet give
the first or second hit,

2791
02:53:42,626 --> 02:53:46,626
or quit in answer
of the third exchange,

2792
02:53:46,626 --> 02:53:49,346
let all the battlements
their ordnance fire.

2793
02:53:49,346 --> 02:53:52,906
The king shall drink to
Hamlet's better breath.

2794
02:53:52,906 --> 02:53:57,946
And in the cup
an union shall he throw,

2795
02:53:57,946 --> 02:54:02,586
richer than that which four
successive kings
in Denmark's crown have worn.

2796
02:54:02,586 --> 02:54:04,826
APPLAUSE

2797
02:54:07,946 --> 02:54:11,626
Let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without,

2798
02:54:11,626 --> 02:54:16,426
the cannon to the heavens,
the heavens to earth, now the king
drinks to Hamlet. Come, begin.

2799
02:54:16,426 --> 02:54:20,226
And you, the judge, bear a wary eye.

2800
02:54:33,146 --> 02:54:35,226
Come on, sir. Come, my lord.
No, judgment!

2801
02:54:35,226 --> 02:54:39,346
A hit, a very palpable hit.

2802
02:54:39,346 --> 02:54:43,426
Well, again.
Stay. Give me the drink.

2803
02:54:43,426 --> 02:54:46,826
Hamlet, this pearl is thine.

2804
02:54:46,826 --> 02:54:48,266
Here's to thy health.

2805
02:54:48,266 --> 02:54:49,466
Give him the cup.

2806
02:54:56,626 --> 02:54:59,266
I'll play this bout first,
set it by awhile.

2807
02:55:16,426 --> 02:55:20,586
Another hit - what say you?
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Our son shall win.

2808
02:55:22,146 --> 02:55:24,106
He's hot, and scant of breath.

2809
02:55:24,106 --> 02:55:29,306
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin,
rub thy brows. The queen
carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

2810
02:55:29,306 --> 02:55:31,186
Good madam! Gertrude,

2811
02:55:33,186 --> 02:55:34,186
do not drink.

2812
02:55:37,466 --> 02:55:39,866
I will, my lord.

2813
02:55:39,866 --> 02:55:41,466
I pray you, pardon me.

2814
02:55:43,426 --> 02:55:45,666
It is the poison'd cup.

2815
02:55:45,666 --> 02:55:48,786
It is too late. I dare not
drink yet, madam, by and by.

2816
02:55:48,786 --> 02:55:50,666
Come, let me wipe thy face.

2817
02:55:50,666 --> 02:55:52,706
My lord, I'll hit him now.
I do not think't.

2818
02:55:52,706 --> 02:55:55,826
And yet
'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

2819
02:55:55,826 --> 02:55:58,226
Come, for the third,
Laertes, you but dally.

2820
02:55:58,226 --> 02:56:01,506
I pray you, pass with
your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

2821
02:56:01,506 --> 02:56:02,586
Say you so? Come on.

2822
02:56:15,066 --> 02:56:16,546
Nothing, neither way.

2823
02:56:18,226 --> 02:56:19,266
Have at you now!

2824
02:56:36,746 --> 02:56:38,346
Nay, come, again.

2825
02:56:38,346 --> 02:56:40,266
My lord! My lord!

2826
02:56:42,906 --> 02:56:45,026
My lord! My lord, my lord!

2827
02:56:55,866 --> 02:56:59,266
They bleed on both sides. How is
it, my lord? How is't, Laertes?

2828
02:56:59,266 --> 02:57:03,866
Why, as a woodcock to mine own
springe, Osric, I am justly
kill'd with mine own treachery.

2829
02:57:03,866 --> 02:57:06,306
How does the queen?
She swounds to see them bleed.

2830
02:57:06,306 --> 02:57:10,986
No, no, the drink, the drink.

2831
02:57:13,306 --> 02:57:14,786
O, my dear Hamlet.

2832
02:57:17,466 --> 02:57:21,346
The drink, the drink!

2833
02:57:21,346 --> 02:57:23,746
I am poison'd.

2834
02:57:26,346 --> 02:57:27,746
O villany!

2835
02:57:29,666 --> 02:57:31,186
How?

2836
02:57:31,186 --> 02:57:34,866
Let the door be lock'd.
Treachery! Seek it out.

2837
02:57:34,866 --> 02:57:36,346
It is here, Hamlet.

2838
02:57:38,546 --> 02:57:40,266
Hamlet, thou art slain.

2839
02:57:40,266 --> 02:57:45,146
No medicine in the world can
do thee good, in thee there
is not half an hour of life.

2840
02:57:45,146 --> 02:57:50,186
The treacherous instrument is in
thy hand, unblunted and envenom'd.

2841
02:57:50,186 --> 02:57:53,586
The foul practise
hath turn'd itself on me.

2842
02:57:55,146 --> 02:57:57,026
Lo, here I lie,

2843
02:57:57,026 --> 02:57:59,826
never to rise again.
Thy mother's poison'd.

2844
02:57:59,826 --> 02:58:02,786
I can no more.

2845
02:58:02,786 --> 02:58:06,546
The king, the king's to blame.

2846
02:58:14,226 --> 02:58:17,626
O, yet defend me, friends.
I am but hurt.

2847
02:58:20,026 --> 02:58:21,026
Here,

2848
02:58:24,066 --> 02:58:28,826
thou incestuous,
murderous, damned Dane.

2849
02:58:28,826 --> 02:58:30,546
Drink off this potion.

2850
02:58:35,106 --> 02:58:38,146
Is thy union here?

2851
02:58:41,226 --> 02:58:43,186
Follow my mother.

2852
02:58:44,266 --> 02:58:48,546
He is justly served,
it is a poison temper'd by himself.

2853
02:58:48,546 --> 02:58:51,146
Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble Hamlet.

2854
02:58:52,746 --> 02:58:56,226
Mine and my father's
death come not upon thee,

2855
02:58:56,226 --> 02:58:57,826
Nor thine on me.

2856
02:59:04,946 --> 02:59:06,706
Heaven make thee free of it!

2857
02:59:08,586 --> 02:59:10,026
I follow thee.

2858
02:59:12,386 --> 02:59:15,346
I am dead, Horatio.

2859
02:59:16,906 --> 02:59:19,026
Wretched queen, adieu!

2860
02:59:20,626 --> 02:59:24,426
You that look pale
and tremble at this chance,

2861
02:59:24,426 --> 02:59:28,146
that are but mutes
or audience to this act,

2862
02:59:29,746 --> 02:59:36,386
had I but time
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest,

2863
02:59:36,386 --> 02:59:38,466
O, I could tell you.

2864
02:59:40,146 --> 02:59:41,386
But let it be.

2865
02:59:43,706 --> 02:59:45,466
Horatio, I am dead.

2866
02:59:47,906 --> 02:59:49,466
Thou livest.

2867
02:59:51,026 --> 02:59:54,626
Report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied.

2868
02:59:54,626 --> 02:59:58,226
Never believe it. I am more
an antique Roman than a Dane.

2869
02:59:58,226 --> 03:00:00,066
Here's yet some liquor left.

2870
03:00:00,066 --> 03:00:03,626
As thou'rt a man,
give me the cuplet! Let go.
By heaven, I'll have't.

2871
03:00:08,786 --> 03:00:10,706
O, good Horatio,

2872
03:00:13,066 --> 03:00:15,626
what a wounded name.

2873
03:00:15,626 --> 03:00:18,546
Things standing thus unknown,
shall live behind me!

2874
03:00:22,026 --> 03:00:24,466
If thou didst ever

2875
03:00:24,466 --> 03:00:26,346
hold me in thy heart,

2876
03:00:29,706 --> 03:00:32,466
absent thee from felicity awhile,

2877
03:00:34,706 --> 03:00:36,826
and in this harsh world

2878
03:00:38,426 --> 03:00:40,626
draw thy breath in pain,

2879
03:00:42,226 --> 03:00:43,746
to tell my story.

2880
03:00:56,546 --> 03:00:57,746
The rest...

2881
03:01:00,986 --> 03:01:02,706
is silence.

2882
03:01:16,106 --> 03:01:18,346
Now cracks a noble heart.

2883
03:01:21,346 --> 03:01:23,626
Good night, sweet prince,

2884
03:01:25,226 --> 03:01:28,626
and flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.
