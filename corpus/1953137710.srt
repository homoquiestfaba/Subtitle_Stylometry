1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,636
- Hey.
- Look, I know

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,268
we've known each other
for a really long time.

4
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,735
And we live across the street
from each other and stuff.

5
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,024
And...

6
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,949
I know, like, in four days,

7
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,698
I'm sure, if...

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,154
- You know, prom's, like, in four days...
- Oh, my God.

9
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,080
You're not asking me to prom, are you?

10
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,713
Fuck, no.

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,665
No, I... No, I just...

12
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,253
- You're probably going with someone.
- I'm sorry.

13
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,088
I don't know how to put this nicely.

14
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,639
There's not a nice way to put it.

15
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,182
You're a fucking nerd.

16
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,056
And, you know... I don't know. She's hot.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,059
Look at her. Look at her.

18
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,558
- Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.
- I'll see you later.

19
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,897
- Bye.
- All right, buddy, good talk.

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,478
Dude, classic.

21
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,983
<i>Greg Jenko to the principal's office.
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.</i>

22
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,784
- Shit.
- Good luck, bro.

23
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,986
I said loud and clear,

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,415
if you didn't get your grades up,
you weren't going to the prom.

25
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,288
You, my friend, are about to pay the piper.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,253
I should pay who?

27
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,501
You're not going to the prom.

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,833
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

29
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,302
But I'm going to be prom king.

30
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,346
I'm glad you had a great time in school.

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,057
'Cause you ain't learned nothing.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,409
Fuck! Fuck!

33
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,010
Welcome to the Police Academy.

34
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,464
Make sure your form is completely filled out,
then move along.

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,470
Not-so-slim Shady, what's up? Holy shit!

36
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,151
Jenko, Schmidt, you're up.

37
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,936
Oh, fuck!

38
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,109
- You're good at this, huh?
- Yeah, lam.

39
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,192
Thank you.

40
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,954
Such bullshit.

41
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,576
You're really good at this.

42
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,623
Yeah, I am.

43
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,206
Hey, you want to be friends?

44
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,882
Come on. Come on, let's go.

45
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,722
Come on, pick your knees up.
Pick your knees up.

46
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm telling you right now, it's not a felony.

47
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,309
Chill, all right?
Look, if it has intent, it's a felony.

48
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,186
What did I tell you?
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

49
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,192
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

50
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,814
Faster. Let's go.

51
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,324
Clear!

52
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,115
Clear!

53
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,200
Come on, come on, come on! Stop.

54
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,830
Yes! Yes!

55
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,291
Let me see. Let me see.

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,547
Nice.

57
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,464
Ten-hut! Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,302
I present to you the graduates of Class 137.

59
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,638
Get ready for a lifetime
of being badass motherfuckers.

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,064
I am.

61
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,448
I really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions,

62
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,655
and less homeless people
doo-dooing everywhere.

63
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,993
Do you guys really think
this is a police matter?

64
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,245
To get your Frisbee back?

65
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,749
Get your own fucking Frisbee.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,413
Shit.

67
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,549
Shit! Shit!

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,002
Yours isn't loaded, right?

69
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,213
We're supposed to unload them first, right?

70
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,672
What, you... No.

71
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,348
That's no fun. Come on.

72
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,016
Sign says, "Do not feed the ducks."

73
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,264
It's right there.

74
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,391
- Don't you... Don't...
- Don't. Stop it.

75
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,440
Don't. You did it. You fed the ducks.

76
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,312
You feel like a big shot?

77
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,773
No fucking way.

78
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,779
One Percenters?

79
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,944
These guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.

80
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,028
If we could take them down as our first bust,
we'd be off park duty for sure.

81
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,329
You see what I see?

82
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,282
Cannabis sativa.

83
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,541
Chaka Khan.

84
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,745
Chaka Khan?

85
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,435
Gentlemen. We having a little party?

86
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,892
Have we forgotten
that the use of marijuana is illegal?

87
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,527
I have glaucoma.

88
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,980
I get nervous in crowds.

89
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,279
Herpes.

90
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,444
Then you won't mind
if I search your bike, now, would you?

91
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,912
Go ahead. You won't find shit.

92
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,790
<i>- Get up.
- CÃ©lmate, gringo.</i>

93
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,416
Man, you guys even real cops?
You look like the kids on Halloween.

94
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,045
If those boys is cops, I'm DEA.

95
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,510
I know, right? I know.

96
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,378
It's hilarious.

97
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,930
So why don't you show us a little respect?

98
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,473
- Fuck you, pig-
- Hey.

99
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,176
You want me to beat your dick off?

100
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,306
You want to beat my dick off?

101
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,228
I'll beat your dick off with both hands.
What's up'? Let's go.

102
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,272
- That's weird, man.
- I think what he was trying to say was,

103
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,942
he's going to punch you so many times
around the genital area

104
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,145
that your dick's just going to fall off.

105
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,570
Why do you have salt in your...

106
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,569
- That's actual drugs.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,275
Get on the ground! Hey!

108
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,985
- Come here now!
- What do I do?

109
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,820
- Chase someone!
- Chase someone?

110
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,702
Are you leaving your bike here?

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,290
Okay. All right.

112
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,994
Don't run from me!
You're making it worse for yourself!

113
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,421
No! Get out of the way!

114
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,748
Stop!

115
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,048
I'm going to shoot you
if you don't slow down, man! Come on!

116
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,592
Hey! Come here!

117
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,175
I'm not playing any more! I'm so not kidding!

118
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,134
I got him. I got him.

119
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,434
Freeze! Freeze!

120
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,653
Hands up or I shoot you! Freeze!

121
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,363
That's it! Come here!

122
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,863
Freeze! Stop it!

123
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,242
You're a pussy!

124
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,131
You got the right to... Give me that!
You got the right to...

125
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,550
...to suck my dick, motherfucker!

126
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,252
My elbow.

127
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,300
- You got nothing.
- How's my dick feel in your ass, huh?

128
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,256
- Hey! Hey!
- How's it feel? How's it feel now?

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,967
That's right. Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!

130
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,469
We got one! I got him!

131
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,226
Yes! Yes!

132
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,897
- Yeah !
- We got an arrest!

133
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,317
- Yeah! We got him!
- Yes!

134
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,899
- Yeah! Fuck you! Yeah!
- Fuck you! Yeah!

135
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,026
What's up?

136
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:48,488
Drop my nuts
on your motherfucking forehead!

137
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,823
- That's right.
- Fuck you, park!

138
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,703
- We arrest people now!
- What up, park?

139
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,410
- What's up? What's up'?
- What up, park? Who wants one?

140
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,510
Congratulations on the bust, boys.
It sounds great.

141
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,304
- Thank you, Cinnamon.
- Are those new?

142
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,890
The department was forced
to drop the charges

143
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,684
because you forgot to read him
his Miranda rights.

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,061
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing

145
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,312
you have to do when arresting someone?

146
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,312
I did read him his right...
I did a version of that.

147
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,528
- Do you even know the Miranda rights?
- Yes.

148
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,484
Let's hear them, then.

149
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,615
You got a lot of stuff to do.

150
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,662
No, go ahead.
You going anywhere, Schmidt?

151
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,830
We got time.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,416
I had a thing, but I can probably push it back.

153
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,746
Go ahead. It's four declamatory sentences,
followed by a question,

154
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,421
for a total of 57 words.

155
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,752
Okay. Look, it obviously starts with,
"You have the right to remain silent."

156
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,838
I know you've heard this before. And then,

157
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,425
I think it sounds something like...

158
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,808
-"You have the right to an attorney."
- Well, the thing... Yeah, right.

159
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,480
"You have the right to remain an attorney."

160
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,604
Did you say
that you have the right to be an attorney?

161
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,313
You do have the right to be an attorney,
if you want to.

162
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,521
Where were you?

163
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,117
I was chasing my perp, sir.

164
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,035
And how did that go for you?

165
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,704
Honestly, he did get away,

166
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,615
and he threw me down pretty hard.

167
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,871
Actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.

168
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,077
Can I see that?

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,630
Yeah, actually, it hurts
'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.

170
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,166
Wow.

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,835
Fortunately for you two,

172
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,673
we're reviving a canceled
undercover police program from the '80s

173
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,428
and revamping it for modern times.

174
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,804
You see, the guys in charge of this stuff

175
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,103
lack creativity
and are completely out of ideas,

176
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,975
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past

177
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,900
and expect us all not to notice.

178
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,193
One of these programs
involves the use of young,

179
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,990
immature-seeming officers.

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,660
Sir, are you saying
that you're going to send us into, like,

181
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,614
a child sex slavery ring or something?

182
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,292
Sir, if I have to suck somebody's dick, I will.

183
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,125
It's just... I'd prefer not to.

184
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,297
I think you idiots are perfect.

185
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,837
You're officially transferred.

186
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,463
- All right. Yeah.
- That's great.

187
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,261
Where should we report to?

188
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,963
Down on Jump Street.

189
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,923
37 Jump Street.

190
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,143
No, that doesn't sound right.

191
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,432
Is it...

192
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,232
This has got to be a joke.

193
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,143
This is it.

194
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,486
Aroma of Christ Church?

195
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,508
How's it going?

196
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,718
This place is weird.

197
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,564
Everybody comfortable?

198
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,315
Yeah.

199
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,204
Get your motherfucking ass up
when I'm talking!

200
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,492
You will be going undercover
as high school students.

201
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,581
You are here simply because you look young.

202
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,673
You some Justin Beaver,

203
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,592
Miley Cyrus-looking motherfuckers.

204
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,131
Captain Sassy.

205
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,887
I know what you're thinking,

206
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,591
"Angry Black Captain."

207
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,268
It ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.

208
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,721
Well, guess what, motherfuckers.

209
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,056
I'm black.

210
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,233
And I worked my ass off to be the captain!

211
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,900
And sometimes I get angry.

212
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,527
So suck a dick!

213
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,780
What I'm trying to show you is,

214
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,948
embrace your stereotypes.

215
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,036
Like this guy right here. Handsome.

216
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,700
And he's probably a dummy.

217
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,956
And then this guy.

218
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,085
He's short and insecure.

219
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,710
And he's probably good with money.

220
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,134
- You are good with money.
- What the fuck?

221
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,632
Didn't somebody tell you guys
this was an undercover unit?

222
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,259
I don't... I actually didn't...

223
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,555
I didn't get a letter or anything.

224
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,350
- Yeah, like, a start time...
- With a dress code or anything like that.

225
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,224
Teenage the fuck up!

226
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,600
Rule number one at Jump Street. Fugazy.

227
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,352
Do not get expelled.

228
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,484
Nobody in the system knows you're here.
All right? Nobody.

229
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,156
You get kicked out of school,

230
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,906
your monkey ass is getting kicked out
of Jump Street.

231
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,737
Rule number two. Burns.

232
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,417
Do not have sexual relations
with students or teachers, sir.

233
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,120
You hear that? That's you.

234
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,916
- Don't do it, man.
- Why...

235
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,624
- Keep that dirty dick in your pants.
- Dirty?

236
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,425
Don't fuck no students.

237
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,089
Don't fuck no teachers.

238
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,639
Sir, I know we come off
<i>as</i> a couple of lady-killers,

239
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,888
but I promise you
we will be super professional on the job.

240
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,436
Clearly, I wasn't talking to you, Big Titties.

241
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,768
You cherub-looking motherfucker.

242
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,191
I was talking to your partner over here.

243
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,234
Fake-ass Handsome McGee.

244
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,278
When I'm talking to him, I'm talking to him.

245
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,526
When I say, "Shut the fuck up,"

246
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,073
- I'm talking to you.
- Cool.

247
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,694
Now, you two sons of bitches,
in my office now.

248
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,949
Right now!

249
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,621
<i>Hi. I am Billiam Willingham.</i>

250
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,286
<i>So I bought these,</i>

251
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,619
<i>which is all anybody seems
to be talking about right now.</i>

252
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,291
<i>Cheers.</i>

253
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,668
It's a new synthetic drug.

254
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,922
Goes by the street name H.F.S.

255
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,969
<i>Holy fucking shit.</i>

256
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,631
<i>Holy...</i>

257
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,807
They put this on the Internet
for everybody to see?

258
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,556
They're teenagers, man.
They're really stupid.

259
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,478
So you should blend right in.

260
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,824
<i>Jessica, will you go to prom with me?
But I already know the answer. It's yes.</i>

261
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,721
I could watch this kid all day.

262
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,382
Man, this kid rules.

263
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,846
Ruled.

264
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,179
His parents found him OD'd
in his room a few days ago.

265
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,559
He's dead.

266
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,189
Whatever he took,
the lab has never seen it before.

267
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,363
And <i>as</i> you can see, this kid is white.

268
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,198
That means people actually give a shit.

269
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,237
Sir, I just want to throw out to you
that I would give a shit if he was black.

270
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:52,085
Right now, H.F.S.
Is contained right there at Sagan High.

271
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,456
Now, once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days.

272
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,252
Jenko, I looked at your old transcript.

273
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,304
I enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses

274
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,427
like photography and drama.

275
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,929
Get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.

276
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,761
Find out who's slinging this shit.

277
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,097
Schmidt, <i>says</i> you were a virgin

278
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,727
-through high school.
- It <i>says</i> that?

279
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,566
No. I just assumed it,

280
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:20,943
due to your many years on the honor roll
and your membership to the juggling squad.

281
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,363
It's the Juggling Society,
but it's fine. it's fine.

282
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,820
They're stealing equipment
from the chemistry lab.

283
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,031
That's what we think
they're cooking the dope with.

284
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,658
I enrolled you into honors chemistry.

285
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,711
Here's your new identities, all right?

286
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,628
Brad and Doug McQuaid.

287
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,498
The mission is this.

288
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,004
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

289
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,926
We get to be brothers?

290
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,097
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

291
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,800
But if we find the supplier first,
we don't have to worry about the dealers.

292
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,636
God damn.
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

293
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,700
Hey, Korean Jesus.

294
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,459
I don't know if you only cater
to Korean Christians

295
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,705
or if you even exist. No offense.

296
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,213
I just...

297
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,014
I'm really freaked out
about going back to high school.

298
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,479
It was just so fucking hard the first time.

299
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:40,477
I know we haven't made our first arrest,
or maybe I'm not the best cop.

300
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,147
Korean Jesus,
I just really don't want to fuck this up.

301
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,820
I'm sorry for swearing so much.

302
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,493
The end?

303
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,947
I don't really know how to end a prayer.
The end?

304
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,202
Yeah.

305
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,871
Hey! Hey!

306
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,337
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

307
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,835
He ain't got time for your problems. He busy!

308
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,465
With Korean shit.

309
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,048
- You two get to your mama house ASAP.
- What?

310
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,808
You're teenagers now, all right?

311
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,102
You two are staying
at Schmidt's parents' house

312
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,895
for the duration of this assignment.

313
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,348
Fuck me.

314
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,059
This house is adorable.

315
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,774
My baby's home! Come here.

316
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,480
You will always be
my infant angel baby child.

317
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,281
There's my QW-

318
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,949
It's great to see you guys.

319
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,404
- Hey.
- Schmidt family! Up top, Papa Schmidt.

320
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,614
Oh, my God.
Mama Schmidt, did you do all this yourself?

321
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,825
- This is unbelievable.
- Well, yeah.

322
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,126
- I guess I did.
- It's gorgeous!

323
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,703
So are you.

324
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,253
Honey, listen, I want to tell you,
we did blow up the air mattress in your room

325
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,549
'cause we're kind of using that
<i>as</i> a workout area,

326
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,293
so I hope you don't mind the elliptical.

327
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,092
No, no! Jenko, Jenko, oh, my God, please.
No, no.

328
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,048
Don't touch that.
We just brought it back from Sedona.

329
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,634
Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?

330
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,185
I mean, it looks like I died in a car crash

331
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,479
-and you guys haven't moved on.
- Rid of it?

332
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,103
If we take it down,
we have to stop bragging about you.

333
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,435
I look like Fred Savage
from The Wonder Years,

334
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,400
but completely naked,
wearing Indian friendship bracelets.

335
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,481
That is a great picture, Morton.

336
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,907
You look like a young Jay Leno.

337
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,610
Am I even wearing underwear in this picture?

338
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,995
No.

339
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,789
I remember. You know why?

340
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,663
Because I've told it to a therapist
about 8,000 times.

341
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:24,088
I mean, this is a fourth grade
participation medal for soccer.

342
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,710
It's literally a medal for sucking.

343
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,713
- No, that is a medal for trying.
- Yes.

344
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,672
Let me tell you something.
This guy was always a great tryer.

345
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,883
That must be Phyllis.
She is just dying to see you.

346
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,014
What? Mom, you told Phyllis I was here?
She's going to tell the whole neighborhood.

347
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,098
I told you, it's an undercover assignment.
It's super secretive.

348
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,482
"Undercover." That's so cute.

349
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,232
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, honey. I want you to know

350
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,733
-we are so glad you're here.
- Okay.

351
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,781
That's great. Thank you.

352
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,109
- All right. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

353
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,991
He just needs to take a little rest,
and then he's dying to see you, too.

354
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,368
- Bye-bye.
- I baked muffins!

355
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,833
If you don't know your identity,
we're screwed tomorrow.

356
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,202
You got to study this stuff.

357
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,163
Forget those identities. They're bullshit.
They said I was held back a year.

358
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,964
You were. You were held back two years.

359
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,134
Just 'cause it's a fake backstory
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

360
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,462
Fuck! Socks don't match.

361
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,967
I got to start all over.

362
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,139
It's the first day of school, dude.
I got to look awesome.

363
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,969
You know, back in the day,
you were super popular,

364
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,770
and I wasn't as much.

365
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,350
We didn't really get along in high school.

366
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,482
You don't think that's going to happen again,
do you'?

367
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,532
No. Come on, man. We're adults now.
We're best buds.

368
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,983
It's definitely not going to happen again.

369
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,659
- We're good.
- Cool.

370
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,669
Beautiful day out there, boys.

371
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,875
Just shut up.

372
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,712
"Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

373
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,008
"You have the right to an attorney.

374
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,133
"If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed..."

375
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,591
Dude, do you still not know
the Miranda rights? You're a cop.

376
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,679
Come on, man. They always cut away on TV
before they finish them.

377
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,066
All right, let's do it.

378
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,942
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

379
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,019
What are you doing?

380
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,025
- What? What are you talking about?
- Are you two-strapping?

381
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,734
- My backpack? Yeah.
- Yeah, I got to be seen with you.

382
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,613
You got to one-strap it.

383
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,287
Seriously, I would no-strap it
if that would even be possible.

384
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,739
Okay, what makes you the expert?

385
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,166
I was cool in high school, and you weren't.

386
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,206
Okay, that makes sense. Continue.

387
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,800
The Three Keys of Coolness in High School,
by Jenko.

388
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,253
One, don't try hard at anything.

389
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,636
Okay? Two, make fun of people who do try.

390
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,637
Three, be handsome.

391
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,969
Four, if anyone steps to you
on the first day of school,

392
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,100
you punch them directly in the face.

393
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,557
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

394
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,896
Shit.

395
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,357
All right, but just don't be driving it
like teenagers,

396
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,284
revving up the engine and shit, okay?

397
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,907
We would never.

398
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,243
Come on, Hoffs. Give us a little credit.

399
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,743
- Hey' You ready?
- Go! '

400
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,257
That was awesome! That was amazing.

401
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,429
- Was I flying'?
- That was amazing.

402
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,802
All right, do mine, do mine.

403
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,430
- Okay, ready? Here I go.
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,100
You okay?

405
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,940
I think I shit my pants.

406
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,619
Hey, park in that handicapped spot.

407
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,494
- It'll make us look cool.
- That's awesome.

408
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,968
Dude?

409
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,926
- Everybody's two-strapping it.
- Just stay with the one-strap.

410
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,886
I can't. I can't. I can't right now.

411
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,563
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Don't succumb to the peer pressure.

412
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,231
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to use two straps.

413
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,901
- One strap is peer pressure.
- No. No. You're fucking up right now.

414
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,936
Okay, those are Goths.

415
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,989
Those are nerds.

416
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,451
I don't know what they are.

417
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,702
What the fuck are those things?

418
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,157
I'm so confused right now.

419
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,832
Whoa.

420
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,137
- Hi.
- Hey.

421
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,963
- Hey.
- Good morning.

422
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,426
Hey, yo. HEY-

423
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,561
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

424
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,230
What's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?

425
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,057
No, try, like, seven.

426
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,060
- What about you?
- Biodiesel, dawg.

427
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,520
Smells like egg rolls.

428
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,403
Yeah, it does.
Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

429
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,702
But we try to ride bikes when we can.
Global crisis and whatnot.

430
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,663
Whatever, man. I don't care about anything.

431
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,457
You don't care about the environment?
That's kind of fucked up, man.

432
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,125
Hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?

433
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,919
I'm trying to study. Thanks.

434
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,585
Look at him. He's trying.

435
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,508
He's actually trying. What a nerd.

436
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,460
Look at the nerd. Look at the nerd.

437
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,796
- Look at him. Look at the nerd.
- Who you calling a nerd, man?

438
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,222
I'm sorry. What...

439
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,967
- Shit!
- Shit, dude.

440
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,144
Are you okay, man'? Hey, what the hell?
Are you serious?

441
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,892
Well, turn that gay-ass music off.

442
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,848
- You punched me because I'm gay?
- What?

443
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,650
No. Come on.

444
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,897
That's not cool, man.

445
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,194
That is really insensitive.

446
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,612
I didn't punch him because he's gay.

447
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,818
I punched him, and then he happened
to turn out to be gay afterwards.

448
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,948
- I was gay when you punched me!
- In a weird way,

449
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,371
it might have been
homophobic not to punch you

450
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,289
-just because you were gay.
- Right.

451
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,367
You punched a little gay
black kid in the face,

452
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,794
and it's not even second period.
How do you explain that?

453
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,581
Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that. I just...

454
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,211
Look, guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?

455
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,044
A kid died the other day from drugs,

456
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,472
and nobody, including me,
is doing anything about it.

457
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,974
That's weird, guys.

458
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,053
And then you two show up, with 30 days left,

459
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,355
causing trouble in my school.

460
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,274
I am one more black gay kid
getting punched in the face

461
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,774
away from a nervous breakdown.
Do I make myself clear?

462
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,105
You guys cross my line again,

463
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:26,697
and you walk into this office,
I'm going to expel you. You got me?

464
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,120
All right, let's do this.
Which one of you is Doug?

465
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,620
Let's do that again
and pretend you guys aren't weird.

466
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,122
Which one of you is named Doug?

467
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,287
- No, dude, I'm Brad.
- Okay, good.

468
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,585
So that means your name is Doug, son.

469
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,166
- Yeah, I'm Doug.
- Great.

470
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,588
Here are your class schedules.

471
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,295
Funny, I wouldn't have taken you
for the brainy type.

472
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,097
I wouldn't.
But you <i>as</i> a drama geek, far less surprising.

473
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,550
Thank you.

474
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,259
Now we have the wrong identities,
you dumb-ass.

475
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,471
I'm in drama. I suck at drama.
It's girly and embarrassing.

476
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,977
Oh, my God. Relax, dude. Who cares?

477
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,352
I can fake my way through band practice
and app chemistry for a few weeks.

478
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,735
AP Chemistry. AP Chemistry.
And, no, you can't,

479
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,736
because you don't even know
what it's actually fucking called!

480
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,449
It's going to be fine. You go to my classes,
and I'm going to go to yours.

481
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,621
Okay, now, chemistry's
the one with the shapes and shit, right?

482
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,031
Fuck.

483
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,786
So, we are going to hold auditions
for the Peter Pan part today.

484
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,173
Billiam would've wanted the show to go on.

485
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,302
When I was a young actorjust starting out
in New York state,

486
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,799
Albany, to be exact,

487
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,098
- I booked a local television commercial...
- Hey.

488
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,175
...In which I had to play a young man...

489
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,182
It's really sad about that kid. He was talented.

490
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,274
So are you saying if he wasn't talented,
it would be less sad?

491
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,902
No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

492
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,357
I was just busting your balls.

493
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,360
Okay. Good.

494
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,620
I remember, one time,
doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse,

495
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,369
and we were having so much fun.

496
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,672
And then I realized that she was dead.

497
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,792
I remember one summer...

498
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,882
Do kids still do this stuff?

499
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,754
Even after what happened to him?

500
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,346
Everyone's saying
that Billiam had a heart murmur.

501
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,519
Pretty much everyone I know does it,
but it's not my thing.

502
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,888
It's not really my thing, either,

503
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,771
but a buddy of mine really wants it.

504
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,774
Who would he call if he wanted it?

505
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,981
Well, you can tell your friend

506
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,407
that if he really wanted it,

507
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,484
it's not so hard to find.

508
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,991
When to take it.
He shouldn't have been taking it at all.

509
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,913
Drugs are bad.

510
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,161
But they can have their place
in the life of a professional actor.

511
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,211
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

512
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,255
Notice the distinction.
I said "professional actor."

513
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,762
New person. Mr. Texty Texty.

514
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,717
Since you have so much to say to Molly,

515
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,264
let's see if you can be Peter to our Wendy.

516
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,222
You look like you might have
a little Peter inside of you.

517
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,810
I can't.
I'm fine just being a tree or something

518
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,028
Doug, you never won't know

519
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,607
what you can't achieve
before you don't achieve it.

520
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,816
My point is,

521
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,699
you have to. Everyone auditions for Peter.

522
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,622
Yeah, sure.

523
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,745
My favorite molecule is water.

524
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,122
I'd marry it, unless it was my daughter

525
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,756
Its solid form floats on its liquid form,
which makes it far outside the norm.

526
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,132
It allowed life to form on ancient Mars,
and we use it to wash our cars.

527
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,050
H2O.

528
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,799
H2O. H2O.

529
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,142
- H20
- It's okay. Thank you.

530
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,979
Thank you, Zack. So good.

531
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,854
All right, anybody else
for Molecule Mondays? Anyone?

532
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,568
Okay. Time for a pop Quiznos.

533
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,937
A what?

534
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,859
I'm sorry.

535
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,441
What is your name? Brad?

536
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,408
- Brad. Yes, ma'am.
- Wow. Look at you,

537
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,111
Brad. Big.

538
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,702
What is a pop Quiznos?

539
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:07,167
It's a quiz, and the first person who finishes
gets a $10 gift certificate to Quiznos.

540
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,332
- Today's quiz is on...
- You look really old.

541
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,512
- Were you held back or something or...
- No. You look super young.

542
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,463
Were you held forward?

543
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,637
I went to school in France, so

544
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,186
And they do, like, two extra years
of middle school there. It's so lame.

545
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,098
French, the language of love.

546
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,813
That's cool, man. It's nice to meet you also.

547
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,860
Hey.

548
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,364
Good luck.

549
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,336
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

550
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,630
<i>I'm just the cleverest...</i>

551
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,094
Okay.

552
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,599
Maybe try one cooler.

553
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,968
And faster.

554
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,555
And louder. And better.

555
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,393
And less insecure and more just cool.

556
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,983
Okay, yeah, those are great notes.

557
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,238
I'm going to run outside,

558
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,117
and I'm going to utilize those,
and I'm going to come back.

559
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,416
It's such bullshit.

560
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,971
Wow. You're fast.

561
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,804
Not like that. Just, let me check you out.

562
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,185
Let me check out your chest.

563
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,982
Check out your test... Let me...

564
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,605
Let me grade your quiz.

565
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,990
Can I go take a dump?

566
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,368
Yeah, okay. That's cool.

567
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,161
We have this "hurry back" rule,

568
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,288
so if you're not back in six minutes,
I have to send you to the principal.

569
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,791
Rules are rules, so,

570
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,045
I guess this will have to be a quickie.

571
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,879
- Which way is yearbook?
- I don't know.

572
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,005
- Is it this way?
- I don't know!

573
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,061
- Yo.
- Hey.

574
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,145
YOU guys, huh?

575
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,616
That was a total mix-up,
what happened earlier.

576
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,817
- Yeah.
- He feels awful. He feels...

577
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,744
Totally, very nervous.

578
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,114
You're the dealer?

579
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,244
- You're the dealer guy?
- Is that you?

580
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,954
Yep.

581
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,159
So do you make the stuff or...

582
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,996
Do I look like a fucking scientist?
No, I just sell it.

583
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,627
- Yeah, he just sells it. Come on
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

584
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,674
- I meant I just...
- How many you guys want?

585
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,422
20 bucks a pop.

586
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,390
One each? One pop each of drugs.

587
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,012
You guys aren't narcs, are you?

588
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,300
Whoa!

589
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,228
- Dude, come on.
- No! Maybe you're a narc.

590
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,188
You know who calls people narcs?

591
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,857
Narcs, narc.

592
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,144
First of all, your argument
kind of just collapsed on itself,

593
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,945
because if you call us narcs,

594
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,778
if narcs call people narcs,
and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...

595
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,701
-'Cause you just said that.
- They call people...

596
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,074
Look, I don't have time for this shit.
You guys want to do this or not?

597
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,246
- Jesus.
- Yes.

598
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,198
- Yes, yes.
- No problem.

599
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,827
All right, take it here so I know you're cool.

600
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,002
I'm sorry. What?

601
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,124
- We were going to take it home.
- I gotta go back to class,

602
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,584
-is the only thing.
- I was thinking that I was going to go home,

603
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,177
maybe turn down the lights,

604
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,629
getting snuggy, get a little weird.

605
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,464
I was going to take it,
and then masturbate later.

606
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,391
Okay, I'm not asking.
Take it now or get the fuck out.

607
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,435
I got to finish the girls' volleyball page
by lunch.

608
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,604
Yeah?

609
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,733
Yeah, no, it's all good.

610
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,484
- I love doing drugs at school.
- I'll just take the drugs right here,

611
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,156
in our mouths.

612
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,903
There you go. That's it.

613
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,538
What is that? Barbecue? Cool Ranch?

614
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,994
Have fun.

615
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,788
- You got to pull the trigger!
- Okay.

616
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,498
You got to pull the trigger!

617
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,379
- We got to throw up, man.
- I can't.

618
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,506
We gotta throw up. That kid, Billiam, died.
We got to throw up.

619
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,303
Just think of something gross.
Think of something gross.

620
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,006
- You fucking think of something.
- Okay, all right, all right.

621
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,558
Your grandma's vagina,
and there's a dick going into it.

622
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,511
- What the fuck are you saying?
- I don't know! I'm just trying!

623
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,312
- I'm trying my best! I'm just trying!
- Fuck! Come on, man!

624
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,264
Dude, let's just finger each other's mouths.

625
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,937
- No!
- Yeah.

626
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,142
No, you're not fingering my mouth.

627
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,945
- Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die?
- Okay, fine!

628
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,739
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Come on!

629
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,078
What are you doing?
Are you trying to find my G-spot?

630
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,159
- Just stick it in!
- I don't know. I've never done this before!

631
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,369
Just stick it in! Go!

632
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,421
Cut your fucking fingernails!

633
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,636
Oh, God!

634
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,758
Is it me?

635
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,183
I'm sorry.

636
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,351
I just can't sometimes.

637
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,184
Think we're going to be fine.
I don't feel anything.

638
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,685
Me, neither.

639
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,353
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

640
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,769
You got a pass for running around
the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?

641
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,567
<i>Pass,</i> in your hand.

642
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,818
Hello.

643
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,575
Damn. You guys are late.

644
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,402
Now I'm going to have to take you
to the principal's office.

645
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,615
- No, no, no, man. Come on, please. Sorry.
- Come on, please.

646
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,700
You have exceptional muscle tone there,
young man.

647
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,290
When'd you go through puberty?
Like, at seven or something?

648
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,587
You look like you're in your mid-20s,
for crying out loud.

649
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,507
McQuaid, huh? Doug McQuaid.

650
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,630
I read your file.

651
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,845
You got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.

652
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,093
What the hell was that? God damn it, son!

653
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,015
Don't ever raise your hand to me like that
again, all right?

654
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,263
I consider that a threat.

655
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,094
I was just saying that I'm Doug.

656
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,021
I'm Doug McQuaid. See, that's Brad.

657
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,849
That's Brad.

658
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,435
You're the new kid who's All County in track?

659
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,316
Yes, I'm Doug McQuaid,

660
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,693
the track star, and this is Brad,
the science prodigy.

661
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,322
He's really fast.

662
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,042
Is this funny to you guys?

663
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,257
So you're Doug. You're Doug. You're Doug.

664
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,554
You're Doug. You're Doug.

665
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,215
Here's the deal.

666
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,139
My track team is full
of physically incapable rejects.

667
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,270
I mean, if I wasn't the coach,
I'd be laughing my ass off

668
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,725
at how spastic they are, but I am the coach,

669
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,776
so I need you.

670
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,145
I need me some Doug McQuaid.

671
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,354
Understand?

672
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,576
I need you to run anchor on the 4 X 400
at today's track meet.

673
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,245
You do that, and I'll sign this pass.

674
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,372
Don't blow on me, son.

675
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,201
I haven't trained.

676
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,920
Guys, don't make me take you
to the principal's office.

677
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,085
Do we have a deal?

678
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,875
Yes.

679
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,093
Nice.

680
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,717
I don't like that.
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

681
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,430
Put your tongue in your mouth, and close it

682
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,222
What are you doing? Stop it.

683
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,598
Actually, that's not bad.

684
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,605
All right, here you go.

685
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,479
Are you guys on drugs?

686
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,236
Okay.

687
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,993
One particle of Unobtainium has
a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

688
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,618
Carry the two, changing its atomic isotoner
into a radioactive spider.

689
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,455
Fuck you, science!

690
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,717
All right, all right, we're good.

691
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,719
We're good. We're good, man. We're good.

692
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,471
We're good, baby.

693
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,977
Good work. Hit that shit.

694
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,734
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

695
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,316
<i>I'm just the cleverest fellow</i>

696
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,029
<i>'Twas ever my fortune to know</i>

697
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,115
<i>I taught a trick to my shadow</i>

698
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,246
<i>To stick to the tip of my toe</i>

699
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,372
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

700
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,218
<i>I've gotta</i>

701
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:38,515
<i>Crow!</i>

702
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,176
Christoph, did you feel that?

703
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,681
Who are you?

704
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,562
Welcome aboard, Peter.

705
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,703
No, keep it going!

706
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,914
Keep it going. That was so tight!

707
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,248
No, no, no, keep it going. Keep it going.

708
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,006
All right, let's go, McQuaid!

709
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,794
All right! Yeah!

710
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,214
I like it! I like the confidence, son!

711
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,846
I know y'all seen this shit before.

712
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,344
I know you've seen this shit before.

713
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,093
Huge lead! Huge lead! We got this. All right.

714
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,061
You're looking amped!

715
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,394
Here we go.

716
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,816
Here we go! Here we go!

717
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,067
Hey, pick it up!

718
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,238
Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up.
What are you doing?

719
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,365
What are you doing? Pick it...

720
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,610
What? McQuaid!

721
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,114
Don't throw the baton, you jackass!

722
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,991
Come on!

723
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,747
McQuaid!

724
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,954
Run that way!

725
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,173
Spike that! Fuck you, Miles Davis!

726
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,132
Let's go, God damn it! Let's do this!

727
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,505
Let's go! Come on!

728
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,181
Oh, my God.

729
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,390
No, no.

730
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,268
No, stop.

731
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,849
Come here. Come here.

732
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,350
Don't make a...

733
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,931
That is a baton penis.

734
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,534
Speak of the devil!

735
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,283
Dude, that was awesome
how you sabotaged that track meet, man.

736
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,615
Organized sports are so fascist.
It makes me sick.

737
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,575
That's just what I do.

738
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,626
Okay. Shit, man. See you around, all right?

739
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,957
I don't get this school.

740
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,460
That was awesome.

741
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,138
Okay, so we stayed up all night making this.

742
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,590
It's awesome. You're really going to like it.

743
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,471
All yarn work was done by Jenko.

744
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,598
Okay, Captain, look,
the dealers are the popular kids,

745
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,894
but they're not normal popular.

746
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,439
They're these crunchy granola dudes
that have convinced everyone

747
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,857
that they're cool, and they're not cool.

748
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,018
It's backwards and unnatural,
and it's got to be stopped.

749
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,820
Lead dealer, Eric Molson. Alpha dog.

750
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,990
Sick chicks, killer steeze.

751
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,278
Did the AIDS run this year.

752
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,902
He's getting into Berkeley, early admish,

753
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,362
and he totally gets me.

754
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,743
Who put this together'? Are you autistic?

755
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,699
It is artistic, sir, because the thing is,

756
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,126
-the yarn actually indicates...
- We're compiling a list

757
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,249
of suspicious types at school.
The users are here.

758
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,627
This kid was actually talking
to a tree this morning.

759
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,798
Cut the bullshit!

760
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,468
I want to know who's the supplier.

761
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,463
We don't know. That's why
there's a question mark on his face.

762
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,719
That's not the way his face looks.
That's just a question mark.

763
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,426
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

764
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,723
Simple.

765
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,018
Sounds like you guys
really cracked the whole case.

766
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,561
Great job. You guys are on fire

767
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,976
- So proud.
- Like you could do any better?

768
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,941
We just brought down a group
of wannabe thugs

769
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,364
stripping down cars
in the Garfield High metal shop.

770
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,568
- What?
- Meanwhile, you two were standing around

771
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,528
finger-popping each other's assholes.

772
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,205
We're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.

773
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,783
What we're doing is getting shit done.

774
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,292
<i>Yeah, as a matter of fact,</i>

775
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,995
<i>I'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech</i>

776
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,423
<i>drug manufacturing ring
in the chemistry classroom.</i>

777
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,132
- Password!
- Open the door!

778
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,183
- You have to say the password.
- I'm sorry. What?

779
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,635
What are you...

780
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,392
Geez.

781
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,227
What are y'all doing?
How'd you get a key in here?

782
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,564
Ms. Griggs gave us one
so we could work, tutor, deal Bakugan.

783
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,987
Bakugan? You dealing drugs?

784
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,651
- Let me see. You dealing drugs?
- No.

785
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,577
It's just a card game.
It's, like, a hybrid card game.

786
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,496
- See? They open up.
- Battle Brawlers.

787
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,414
- You're not doing anything illegal?
- No.

788
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,036
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm here to study.

789
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,630
Good. You could use it.
You're pretty far behind, so...

790
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,790
You're behind. I'm ahead.

791
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,088
- I know everything.
- Really'?

792
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,927
What's a covalent bond?

793
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,005
Fuck you, man. I don't need to tell you.

794
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,557
I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry

795
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,351
I just... I don't think you know everything.

796
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,727
I know everything.

797
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,475
Okay.

798
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,279
What kind of bullshit do they say
about a covalent bond in this school?

799
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:10,703
They say it's when two atoms
share both their electrons.

800
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,371
It helps them to stick together.

801
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,663
I could help you out if you want,
tutor you for the test.

802
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,745
What are you doing
with all those phones anyway?

803
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,873
I crack and jailbreak kids' phones
to try and save for college.

804
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,709
You know, I switch their wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.

805
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,009
Can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?

806
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,965
No, no, I can't install a spyvvare
to remotely monitor calls

807
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,425
or anything that the mic picks up.

808
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,935
- I can't do that at all.
- Wait, you can't do it?

809
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,557
No, I can't.

810
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,723
- Is he being sarcastic?
- I don't know.

811
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,100
So you can.

812
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,278
Liking comic books is popular.

813
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,109
Environmental awareness, being tolerant.

814
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,367
If I was just born 10 years later,
I would have been the coolest person ever.

815
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,365
I know. It's bullshit.

816
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,909
You know what?

817
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,336
I totally know the cause.

818
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,834
<i>Glee. Fuck you, Glee.</i>

819
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,841
Man, I got to say, this is kind of awesome.

820
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,050
I might become popular.
I might get in with the popular kids.

821
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,388
We just have to do something
wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.

822
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,635
You saying we should throw a party?

823
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,604
I'll invite Molly,
and then Molly will invite Eric,

824
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,728
and that'll be the quickest way for me
to bro down with him.

825
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,185
Wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated
the cool kids' group?

826
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,644
I think it would be better if you get in

827
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,274
with the nerdy kids
and see what's going on over there.

828
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,856
That'd be the best thing for the case.

829
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,988
Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense.

830
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,545
- Hello?
- Hey. Is this Molly?

831
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,121
Speaking.

832
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,673
Hey. It's Schmidt.

833
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,552
It's Doug Schmug McQuaid.

834
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,925
Hey, man.

835
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,972
It's so weird that you're calling me.

836
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,178
I pretty much text
except for when a random old relative calls.

837
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,057
I was just calling 'cause we're costarring
in this play together,

838
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,232
<i>-and.</i> . .
<i>- Hello ?</i>

839
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,521
Mom, get off the phone!

840
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,644
<i>Sorry, Do!-IQ,</i>

841
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,400
<i>-my teen son.
- Mom!</i>

842
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,861
<i>I love you, honey, Dougie,
Doug, Douglas McQuaid.</i>

843
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,783
Mom, so serious right now! Stop!

844
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,456
<i>I'm sorry. My mom's such a dick.</i>

845
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:23,624
She just, like, smothers me with affection
and makes me feel like I'm five years old.

846
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,957
Wow. You're a sharer. I dig that.

847
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,468
<i>Well, I'm 18 years old, and my mom
still packs a lunch for me every day.</i>

848
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,805
There was this one month
where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.

849
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,682
<i>The doctor thought
I was gonna spontaneously grow a vagina.</i>

850
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,718
I didn't, though, just to be clear.

851
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,599
Yeah, because you already had one.

852
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,183
Exactly. I already had one.

853
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,015
And you don't need two vaginae.
You just don't.

854
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,100
<i>Although you could use one as a coin purse.</i>

855
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,686
I never got any stuffed animals growing up.

856
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,022
Wait, actually, that's not true. I did.

857
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,948
My dad gave me a stuffed puppy
the day he bailed on us.

858
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,403
I'm just fucking with you.

859
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,491
That is a weird joke.

860
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,206
I thought your dad abandoned your family.

861
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,874
No, he did walk out on us, though.

862
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,869
But he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.

863
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,044
Just broken dreams.

864
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,465
Oh, man. Well, I guess, to that, I would say

865
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,625
well,

866
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,129
that there are some good guys out there,

867
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,807
and I wouldn't let, you know, one experience

868
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,226
taint your memory.

869
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,811
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

870
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,730
Are you getting choked up?
I'm sorry if I made you upset.

871
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,651
<i>No, it's just, you know,
I don't like when guys are mean to girls.</i>

872
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,070
Yeah. Well, thanks.

873
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,569
Normal transition here.

874
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,903
Actually, I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come!

875
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,828
You and Eric and Juario, whatever.

876
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,082
Do you mind if I just put, like,
a posting on Facebook?

877
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,159
Okay. Yeah, yeah!

878
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,873
<i>I should call you back.</i>

879
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,206
Well, all right, I'll see you at school.
You're a great person.

880
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,255
-5ye-bye. <i>B</i> ye_
- Bye.

881
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,878
<i>What the fuck are you...</i>

882
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,061
Are y'all throwing a party?

883
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:08,979
- What?
- There's rumors in the Twittersphere.

884
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,602
And if any of my officers

885
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,781
are caught giving alcohol to minors,

886
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,157
they'll find theyself in prison

887
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,575
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth

888
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,870
and me shitting down that snorkel.

889
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,703
That's extremely vivid. Thank you.

890
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,752
You're the best. You are the best.

891
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,458
- Oh, my God.
- We love you.

892
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,633
- Enjoy the vineyard.
- You boys be good, now.

893
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,007
Yeah, I can't believe you guys did this for us.

894
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,467
Bye!

895
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,049
"We love you"? What are you doing'?
Why you saying "I love you" to my mom?

896
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,475
- I'm in character. Shut up.
- It's weird.

897
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,725
Look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.

898
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,973
Wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?

899
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,316
Dude, I don't have a fake ID.

900
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,993
How are we going to get drugs for the party?

901
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,158
Oh, no.

902
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,957
We got a pound of coke.

903
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,415
We're trying to show them a good time,
not ruin their fucking lives.

904
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,589
Pound of marijuana?

905
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,675
- Best party ever.
- Boo-yah!

906
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,485
To a brilliant idea

907
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,437
from my brilliant brother

908
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,564
that I love so very much.

909
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,275
And this is going to fucking rock.

910
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,198
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

911
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,702
- Who invited you guys?
- I did!

912
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:52,787
The party's here!

913
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,047
- What's up, Zack?
- Hey, buddy.

914
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,169
What's up, Roman?

915
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,627
This is crazy. This is, like,
the craziest thing I've ever been a part of.

916
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,387
Where is Eric, man? He said he'd be here.

917
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,013
Do we have enough chips?

918
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,016
Is this playlist too dance-y?

919
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,221
- Feels too dance-y.
- Too dance-y?

920
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,729
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, it just feels dance-y.

921
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,655
What are you doing?

922
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,858
- That's my mom's Kokopelli vase.
- I got it, I got it.

923
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,409
Doug, Doug, hey!

924
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,658
<i>Hey, Paul Blart: Molly Cop.</i>

925
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,872
Such a bad joke.

926
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,074
Terrible, terrible.

927
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,329
- You guys know each other, right?
- Yeah.

928
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,249
Get ready, get ready, there's Eric.
Wait for the signal.

929
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,251
And then you come in here
looking like a rock-solid 10.

930
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,456
What?

931
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,424
What's up, man, how you doing?

932
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,297
Eco Suave.

933
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:42,837
Whoa.

934
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,094
Wow, so I'm really digging this decor.

935
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,347
Very Native American.

936
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,227
Yeah, our parents are actually

937
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,771
-really into Native American...
- Let's rock and roll.

938
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,062
- Sorry.
- What are y'all doing?

939
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,235
- Come on.
- Did you guys even see Eric?

940
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,362
Seriously, did you not see Eric?

941
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,614
No offense, man, but your brother sucks.

942
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,443
Yo, this is butt.
There's, like, no hot dudes here.

943
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,278
- Man, let's bounce.
- We're out of here, man.

944
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,205
No, no, no, come on, you guys just got here
you just got here.

945
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,454
Come on, let me at least give you a tour.

946
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,911
Okay, boys, come on, we did it,
we can do this, just go,

947
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,541
just go as fast as you possibly can.

948
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,257
Taking out the SIM card.

949
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,300
<i>Taking down Eric
with the SIM card information</i>

950
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,128
Come on, CSI the shit out of this thing.

951
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,838
- Are you drunk?
- No.

952
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,298
Have you even been drunk before?

953
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,928
- No, but...
- Give me this.

954
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,635
- What?
- Can we get some bitches up in here?

955
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,516
'Cause it's just boys right now.

956
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,313
No, you can't get any bitches up here.

957
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,099
This is my parents' bedroom.

958
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,522
- What the fuck, bro? Some privacy!
- Shit, shit, shit!

959
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,025
And that is a really gross three-way.

960
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,111
But what was the girl in the back doing?

961
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,193
Warehouse rave in Ellsworth.

962
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,028
Cool, yeah.

963
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,113
Hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,

964
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,291
but we got to get going.
You know how it is, yeah?

965
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,992
Dude, tell me about it.

966
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,620
Is it ready? He's gonna leave right now.

967
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,167
It's extracting right now.

968
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,169
Dude, it's now or never! Is it ready or not?

969
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,000
Read this.
"Please wait. Extracting data from SIM card."

970
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,256
Shit! It's a bust.

971
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,640
- Keep it casual.
- Yeah.

972
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,725
- Go with the flow, dude.
- Cool, man.

973
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,177
- I don't like to make plans or whatever.
- You got it.

974
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,352
- Thank you again, though, man.
- All right.

975
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,853
Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, man, what's up?

976
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,025
Hey, why you here, Scott?

977
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,523
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?

978
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,605
No, I heard you guys were partying
with some new stuff.

979
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,199
Wanted to know your hookup
so me and my boys can get in on it.

980
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,197
Got other commitments on that front,
so, you know...

981
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,368
I wasn't asking.

982
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

983
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,041
Take five, take five, man, let me get this.
I got this.

984
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,460
- Yeah? You sure?
- I got this one.

985
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,372
Hey, big player, I don't know who you are.

986
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,378
- Don't worry about who I am.
- I'm worried about it.

987
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,459
- Why?
-'Cause you're at my party right now, dude.

988
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,962
This is my temple,
this is where I come to find peace, dawg,

989
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,889
and you're coming in here
like an emotional bull in a china shop,

990
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,468
metaphorically knocking over vases,
messing with my crew,

991
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,647
and I'm like, "What, Scott, what, Scott,
what, what, what, what, Scott?"

992
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,098
- It's that kind of party?
- Yeah, dude.

993
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,149
Matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?

994
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,227
- No, it's getting real.
- It's getting very real.

995
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,109
Yeah. It's like seven strangers
living in one house. True story.

996
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,565
- You want <i>Real</i> World?
- Yeah, let's do it, man.

997
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,241
- Come on. What's your Real...
- Here's Real World.

998
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,239
What was that? Did you hear that?

999
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,786
Real enough for you?

1000
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,329
Schmidt. Doug.

1001
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,998
- What do I do?
- Hit him!

1002
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,539
Shit! That hurt worse than when he hit me!

1003
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,467
Fight normal.

1004
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,965
Yo, I'm serious.

1005
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,170
Sorry.

1006
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,894
- I'll fucking kill you!
- I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

1007
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,269
Seriously, use your words, use your words!

1008
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,065
I kicked him in the nuts.

1009
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,868
Fight's over, dude! Fight's over! Fight's over!

1010
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,453
No, watch my mom's shit, man!

1011
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,409
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- You'll knock over my mom's vase!

1012
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,540
- Fuck your mom's vase!
- Fuck this!

1013
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,883
Oh, shit!

1014
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,924
Yeah!

1015
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,842
That's my brother!

1016
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,267
- That was insane!
- You're so cool!

1017
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,229
Did you see that shit? That was crazy.

1018
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,742
Oh, shit.

1019
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,737
When did I get stabbed?

1020
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,451
That's awesome.

1021
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,575
Yeah!

1022
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,580
Is that a cop?

1023
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,916
Where?

1024
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,259
No, it's not. Here.

1025
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,012
I'm so glad we're going back
to get my phone.

1026
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,930
I just hope we don't wake up Schmidty.

1027
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,424
Oh, my God, he's a policeman now.

1028
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,601
It's like we're living with a narc.

1029
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,644
The boy is an angel.

1030
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,304
Pull it out!

1031
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,359
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

1032
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,559
Sorry!

1033
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,821
Okay, let's take some shots.

1034
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,281
Shots, shots!

1035
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,750
That's like us fucking Mother Earth
without a condom.

1036
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,202
What the fuck is going on?

1037
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,169
Annie, hang on.

1038
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,883
Are you fucking kidding me?

1039
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,924
Get out of my house. I said get out!
The party's over!

1040
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,471
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry!

1041
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,348
The mom is coming!

1042
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,508
- Listen to me!
- Chill out! Chill out!

1043
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,306
- Let go of me!
- You're embarrassing me

1044
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,353
-in front of my friends!
- Get back here, you shit!

1045
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,483
Dude, that was so crazy, man.

1046
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,778
I swear, best party I've been to in years.

1047
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,480
Dude, I'm doing crazy stuff like that,

1048
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,236
-like, all the time, man.
- I bet you are.

1049
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,779
Dude, I'm so amped right now, God!

1050
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,828
You, dude, I like you, man.

1051
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,497
How do you feel about making
a little extra money?

1052
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,662
Whatever it is, I'm in.

1053
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:46,993
All right, here's the deal.

1054
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:51,000
Okay, I can't sell all this shit on my own,
but I only bring in people I like.

1055
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,049
Okay, you do good,
maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,

1056
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,214
I introduce you to my hookup.
How's that sound?

1057
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,466
- Cool with me.
- My man.

1058
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,422
That is my man...

1059
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,383
That was nuts. I lost you guys.

1060
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,187
Hey, thank you again for the party, man.

1061
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,639
Yo, yo.

1062
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,236
Come on!

1063
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,319
"I love dick"?

1064
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,900
You think that's funny?

1065
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,485
<i>"Wonder Years douche"?</i>

1066
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,787
What kind of a sick animal draws

1067
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,332
an ejaculating penis
into an 8-year-old's mouth?

1068
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,456
It's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.

1069
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,918
You think I don't know
that's a dick and balls?

1070
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,915
I know all about dick and balls!

1071
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,376
I partied with Robert Downey Jr.
before he got sober,

1072
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,712
when he was really fucked up
and a lot of fun!

1073
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,843
You know what?
From now on, you're gonna do some chores.

1074
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,220
You're gonna wash the laundry,
you're gonna fold it,

1075
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,929
you're gonna do the dishes,
you're gonna mow the lawn...

1076
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,273
Dude, I have a surprise for you.

1077
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,150
Last night at the party, I took Eric's phone

1078
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,945
and I had Zack put
this monitoring device in it,

1079
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,194
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing
that little prick is up to.

1080
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,195
Dude, I don't know if that was a good idea.

1081
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,246
What?

1082
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,289
- What if you had gotten found out?
- But it worked.

1083
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,242
This is, like,
the smartest move I've ever pulled,

1084
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,953
so, I'm sorry,
what are you getting mad at me for?

1085
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,960
I'm not getting mad at you.
I'm glad you have something to do.

1086
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,505
Good.

1087
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,056
What's up?

1088
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,062
Great job, Schmidt

1089
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,039
- Password!
- Kneel before Zod!

1090
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,411
You may enter.

1091
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,083
Thank you, Zod.

1092
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,293
Let's tap that wire, huh?

1093
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,128
We were just about to go outside
with a bunch of chemicals.

1094
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,009
We were going to test what blows up.

1095
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,349
There's no reason the wiretap
is super urgent, right'?

1096
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,637
Not that I can think of
that would make sense.

1097
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,643
Go for it, go for it.

1098
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,520
- Look out.
- Go, go, go!

1099
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,561
Yes!

1100
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,860
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

1101
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,361
That's what I'm talking about!

1102
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,908
I love this science shit!

1103
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,406
This is what you guys do all day?
Let's do it again.

1104
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,262
Are you texting Molly?

1105
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,759
What?

1106
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,682
I don't... Molly...

1107
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,638
Maybe. Is that...

1108
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,345
Whoa, it's cool, man, come on.

1109
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,602
I'm not some, like,
'50s letterman who pins a girl.

1110
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,310
I mean, yeah, we blow each other sometimes,
but it's not a thing.

1111
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,522
I just, like... I don't know,
I don't believe in possessions, ja feel?

1112
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,399
Ja feel, ja definitely feel.

1113
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,489
- Yeah.
- Schmidty?

1114
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,241
Schmidty.

1115
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,406
Phyllis.

1116
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,076
- I'll be right back, dude.
- Okay.

1117
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,379
Hey. How are you?

1118
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,673
- How is my favorite police officer?
- Okay.

1119
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,297
Your mother told me that you are undercover.

1120
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,878
Listen, now is not a really good time.

1121
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,929
Are you undercover right now?

1122
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,473
Yes, it means I'm undercover right now.

1123
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,266
Are those the bad guys over there?

1124
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,185
Do they have guns? Oh, my God.
Oh, God, this is so exciting.

1125
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,104
I have got to call Annie. She is gonna die.

1126
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,100
I heard that that Jenko boy is your partner.

1127
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,809
- Where is my phone?
- Okay, okay.

1128
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,189
Shut your fucking mouth.

1129
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,397
Shut your fucking mouth,
you understand me?

1130
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,322
Let's go check this out.

1131
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,526
I will straight-up punch you in the face
if you do not shut up.
