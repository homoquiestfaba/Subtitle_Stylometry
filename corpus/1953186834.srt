1
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:21,057
I'd like an ambulance, please.

2
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,585
5-2-s-s...

3
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,928
Arden Drive.

4
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,560
Yeah.

5
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,661
Thanks.

6
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:01,523
<i>I think I hardly need
to tell you that I was very vain.</i>

7
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,694
<i>In a rich man's life,
our type leads.</i>

8
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,728
<i>If</i> a <i>man's not vain, he doesn't
have much to five for.</i>

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,741
<i>So I went out of my Way to make
absolutely sure that the</i>

10
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,267
<i>benefit was organized with the
maximum possible good taste.</i>

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,677
Garlic and dill.

12
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,703
<i>Mmm!</i>

13
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,773
Always, you always do
a remarkable job.

14
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,342
Well, thank you.

15
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,650
<i>{personally supervised
the catering.</i>

16
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,020
Not too much,
but we want enough.

17
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,355
<i>No rubber chicken served here.</i>

18
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,418
<i>{issued ah' the invitations myself</i>

19
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,601
Thank you very much for coming,
it means a lot, this charity.

20
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,934
The most important thing that we
can get out of today is understanding

21
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,463
that a little bit goes such a long way
around the world...

22
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,467
<i>The music began fairly early.</i>

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,242
<i>Oh, how Well I remember
all the details of that evening.</i>

24
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,342
<i>I remember how he produced his violin,
the Way he opened the case,</i>

25
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,879
<i>tossed a cloth aside and took his
cheap violin out like it was a Strad.</i>

26
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,792
<i>I remember the Way my Wife
sat down at the piano,</i>

27
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,021
<i>trying to appear indifferent...</i>

28
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,754
<i>when I could tell she was
extremely nervous,</i>

29
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,700
<i>scared she was gonna fuck it up.</i>

30
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,761
<i>They played Beethoven's
”Kreutzer Sonata”.</i>

31
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,363
<i>You know it.</i>

32
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,874
<i>The first movement?</i>

33
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,069
<i>I hate that fucking sonata.</i>

34
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,078
<i>In fact, I hate classical music.</i>

35
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,080
<i>I mean, What's it about?</i>

36
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,139
<i>What? What's it for?</i>

37
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,810
<i>You can't dance to it.</i>

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,912
<i>You can't hum the tune.</i>

39
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,823
<i>What am I supposed to do,
sit there like some dummy?</i>

40
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,189
<i>Doing What?</i>

41
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,924
<i>Waiting for the end so that
I can applaud politely?</i>

42
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,967
<i>I've read that music carries
you directly into the state</i>

43
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,908
<i>of consciousness that was
experienced by the composer.</i>

44
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,571
<i>How does anyone know what
the fuck was on Beethoven's mind</i>

45
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,137
<i>when he Wrote this?</i>

46
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,978
<i>I don't.</i>

47
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,745
<i>Do you?</i>

48
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,554
<i>You know the Way it happens
sometimes?</i>

49
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,557
<i>It's like an electric shock
goes through you</i>

50
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,525
<i>and you Wake up.</i>

51
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:27,657
<i>I Woke up like that in a hotel room
in San Francisco...</i>

52
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:32,158
<i>my head full of thoughts about her,
about my sexual desire for her...</i>

53
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,935
<i>about him, the violinist...</i>

54
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,806
<i>and the two of them fucking.</i>

55
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,288
Hello?

56
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,316
Hi, Ginger, it's Edgar.

57
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,420
Is she back yet?

58
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,862
No, um...

59
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,424
she called, she'll be back
around 11:15.

60
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,992
Oh.

61
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,630
All right, I'll talk to you
tomorrow, thanks.

62
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,907
<i>I shuddered with rage and horror.</i>

63
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,639
Stay down!

64
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,352
<i>Then I</i> began <i>to
reason with myself</i>

65
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,154
<i>{had no reason to think that</i>

66
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,354
<i>Nothing's going on.</i>

67
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,828
<i>Nothing's been going on...</i>

68
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,729
<i>I</i> mean, <i>she's my wife?</i>

69
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,256
<i>The mother of my children.</i>

70
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,030
This is very L.A.

71
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:20,408
It's a bubbly moment...
It's a breast fully moment.

72
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,073
Yeah, it's not last summer,
it's many summers ago.

73
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,748
And what else?

74
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,309
And it seems to be rather...

75
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,377
- Fun!
- Fun.

76
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,353
And open.

77
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,290
Yeah, blowing.

78
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:38,489
What do you know
about art anyway?

79
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,326
Not a lot.

80
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,494
What do you know? Do you know
anything about big fish?

81
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,594
Do I? No...

82
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,798
I like yours, you like mine...

83
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,400
That's the way it works.

84
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,272
What are you drinking?

85
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,471
Oh, you want,
you want a little sip of mine?

86
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,308
Yeah, I'll have yours.

87
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,610
It's free...the drink
is freezing my hand off.

88
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,581
The drink is free?

89
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,514
Free-Zing.

90
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,382
I'm free!

91
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,885
Are you from L.A.?

92
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,087
I am, I've lived here
practically all my life.

93
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,288
Shall I hold it for you?

94
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,990
I'm just worried about
your hands getting cold.

95
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,555
You're gonna hold it for me?

96
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,396
- Are your hands getting cold?
- No.

97
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,594
See? Feel how cold mine are.

98
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,363
Your hands are...

99
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,426
No!

100
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,242
Um, I'm not-
you didn't ask me...

101
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,743
No, I didn't!

102
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,972
But I'm not from here.

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,842
Where are you from?

104
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,008
I am from New York.

105
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,747
And I don't really like L.A. that much,
but I have to tell you,

106
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,051
it was definitely the right
career move for me to come here,

107
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,958
because, um, you know, it's
a really difficult business that I'm in.

108
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,017
I'm a classical pianist

109
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,999
and there really aren't
that many places to get jobs

110
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,297
and L.A., I think,
is really on the rise.

111
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,668
Wonderful-I would love
to hear you play.

112
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,763
I bet you would.

113
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,273
And I would really like to play for you.

114
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,209
Well, are you with anybody now?

115
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,234
I am, yeah.

116
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,338
Where is he?

117
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,179
I don't know where he is.

118
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,344
Not here.

119
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,216
Presently.

120
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,278
And not comfortable with me
probably being here either...

121
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,520
So maybe I should go inside.

122
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,464
In fact, I think I'm gonna
go get a drink.

123
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,714
Oh hi, honey.

124
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,809
Um, come on in.

125
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,875
I was looking for you.

126
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,908
Really.

127
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,785
I was looking for you.

128
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,880
Yeah, you were...

129
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:46,847
I'll take care of you.

130
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,217
Why are you acting surprised?

131
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,014
Why are you acting surprised?

132
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,854
What's going on?

133
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,553
Nothing, nothing.

134
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,858
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

135
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,023
Mmm, thank you.

136
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,272
Absolutely.

137
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,242
What kind of counseling?

138
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,302
- Marriage.
- Marriage.

139
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,574
Kinsey's not dating anybody.

140
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,047
Who are you telling that to?

141
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,913
I'm not telling that to you.

142
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,409
I'm saying that to Edgar because
I had a conversation with him.

143
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,183
Edgar, Kinsey's not dating...

144
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,384
No, I wanna know what
the conversation was, really.

145
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,585
About alter egos.

146
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,684
It was nothing.

147
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,719
God, I'm sorry.

148
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,254
I almost threw up my food!

149
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,527
Is he some kind
of a split personality?

150
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,230
This is awful now because I've
backed myself into a corner!

151
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,570
And I remember what you said,
god damn it!

152
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,877
No, he was just saying that secrets
are very hard to maintain...

153
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,008
and that they can sometimes
work in your best interest.

154
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,450
That trust is an imposition.

155
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,887
Something that we attach
all this importance to

156
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,983
when sometimes somebody fails
and in actual fact, they haven't.

157
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,551
It's just your idea of them.

158
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:09,089
There's a trust... If you don't
have trust, I don't understand...

159
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,226
But, but I think Edgar has
an interesting point...

160
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,998
I mean, define that trust.

161
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,628
Define the trust?

162
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,036
You trust that you love each other,

163
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,232
you trust that you
want to stay together,

164
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,799
you trust that each other's
the most important

165
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,336
thing in each other's
life, I think.

166
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,541
Yeah, but I bet you any,
any monogamous couple

167
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,311
in any relationship,
if they were given

168
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,684
the right circumstance,
the right moment, the right timing,

169
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,189
the right chemistry with someone else,
they would stray.

170
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,213
This is not about us.

171
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,725
I'm just saying, in general...

172
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,426
Would you like some more wine?

173
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,269
Kinsey's gonna drop me off.

174
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,339
Oh, ..

175
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,907
But you know, just, uh...

176
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,513
I love you, just, I'll see you at home.

177
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:21,235
<i>I drove home positively
beside myself with enthusiasm,</i>

178
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,039
<i>convinced that she was
the acme of perfection.</i>

179
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,511
<i>What sold me?</i>

180
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,708
<i>The exquisite piano playing.</i>

181
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:37,585
<i>Surely someone so talented
had to have a deep and kind soul.</i>

182
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:45,622
<i>There and then, I first
Wanted her to be my Wife.</i>

183
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,547
But it was my first kiss.

184
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,516
It was in Ireland and she...

185
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,884
she was a girl that was
introduced to me by a friend

186
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,515
called Jerry Lynch.

187
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,322
But the thing was that she'd
been observing me

188
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,692
and I'd actually never seen her.

189
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,355
This is what he asked me to do:

190
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,888
He said go in the middle
of a field, lie down,

191
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,923
cover YOU F eyes

192
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,999
and wait.

193
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,372
So I waited, waited, waited...

194
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:10,312
and then I felt hair
pour over my face...

195
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,474
Ohh...

196
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:17,249
- and then breath grazed my cheek...
- And lips...

197
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,813
against my face.

198
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:26,490
And I was so overcome by the moment
that I actually never opened my eyes.

199
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,519
Ohh...

200
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,623
and I never saw her.

201
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,634
Oh...

202
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,999
that is so sweet.

203
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,838
Have you ever been married?

204
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,068
I have, yeah.

205
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,508
Yeah?

206
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,978
Once before.

207
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,505
How is that?

208
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:51,317
It was wonderful in its own way,
and then it slowly but surely fizzled.

209
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,290
Did you ever cheat on your wife?

210
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,917
Um...

211
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:56,824
Your lip just quivered!

212
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,226
I'm a big cheat.

213
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,957
You're a big cheat?

214
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,328
Yeah.

215
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,199
Well, then, maybe you can
show me how, 'cause I'm really...

216
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,602
This is new for me.

217
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,607
Well, I am showing you how.

218
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,767
Am I not?

219
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,639
I mean, I'm not with somebody.

220
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,806
You are.

221
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,340
Well, I guess I'm really not
having a hard time with it then.

222
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,094
Are you dating anybody?

223
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,268
Two very bad people.

224
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:53,176
I didn't really think it was
my place to ask, so I didn't ask.

225
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,785
I dated people I didn't like
for a really long time

226
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,553
and that worked for me.

227
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,522
And then sex became
a little bit of a game.

228
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:12,696
A little bit of a control thing,
a power thing.

229
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,551
My mom is very cool.

230
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:37,323
She's a very open, bohemian...

231
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,455
Amsterdam;I-type

232
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,363
And your father?

233
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,331
Very closed.

234
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,835
Very German.
Very German.

235
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,132
Banker type?

236
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,265
I had to sneak around the corners
and wait for him to talk to me.

237
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,899
I had to raise my hand.

238
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,068
No, I'm just kidding.

239
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:59,506
No, he's, um...he's very serious
and he's, you know,

240
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,247
a businessman, and he is...

241
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,813
multi-lingual, which
makes him fascinating.

242
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,351
He loves poetry and literature
and he's interesting,

243
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,420
I just don't know him that well.

244
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,760
But I like him.

245
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:19,462
If I met him at a dinner party,
I probably would like him.

246
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,166
But I don't really talk to him
that much.

247
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,141
And...

248
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,470
l guess...

249
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,778
I guess the same kind of goes
for my mom too.

250
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:37,219
I'm not super close to her,
but I admire her greatly.

251
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:57,263
I shouldn't be
falling for you...

252
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,902
Oh...

253
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,878
I shouldn't.

254
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,279
I shouldn't be falling
for you either.

255
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,012
I shouldn't...

256
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,451
I shouldn't...

257
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,356
mmm.

258
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,390
Did you ever walk in and catch
your parents having sex ever?

259
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,425
I did, yes.

260
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,562
Did you?

261
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,731
Yeah, I did, actually.

262
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,137
I was...

263
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,075
I was, uh...

264
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,840
maybe four, five years old.

265
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,677
And I heard this, um...

266
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,947
terrifying scream...

267
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,011
a sort of moaning,

268
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,521
screaming sound.

269
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,924
And I got very concerned.

270
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:57,127
And I got out of bed,
walked down the hallways...

271
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,432
pitter patter, pitter patter,
pitter patter...

272
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,871
and continued hearing these moans
coming from my mother...

273
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,468
and I went into the room...

274
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:12,881
and I saw this man's back, this
very defined muscular man's back,

275
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,281
and it wasn't my father.

276
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,341
Oh no.

277
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,217
Oh no!

278
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,451
And the man was eating my mother.

279
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,187
Shh...Oh no!

280
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,718
I literally thought he was eating-
he was eating her out,

281
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,821
but I literally thought...

282
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,160
Oh no!

283
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,358
He was eating her.

284
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,726
And uh...

285
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,466
Oh, that's awful!

286
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,101
And I went up to the bed
and I pounded his back

287
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,876
and he turned around and...
and looked at me in horror.

288
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,678
And my mother said, "it's ..,
it's .., everything's fine.

289
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,709
I'm fine, darling.
Go back to your bedroom."

290
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,152
Who was he?

291
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,280
Her lover.

292
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,517
Really?

293
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,661
Abby!

294
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,100
Abby! Can I please talk to you
for a minute?!

295
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,244
Fuck!

296
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,798
<i>Of course he was fucking her.</i>

297
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,601
<i>It's what she does.</i>

298
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,439
<i>It's what she Wants,
that's her power, that's...</i>

299
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,706
<i>Why I married her.</i>

300
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,483
<i>It's the only thing about her that I
Want, it's the only thing</i> that...

301
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,214
<i>other bastards Want.</i>

302
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,189
<i>And he's a good-looking guy,
he's a musician, he's,</i>

303
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,354
<i>he's a single guy, he's...young.</i>

304
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,420
<i>Nothing could stop him.</i>

305
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,160
<i>I don't even know who she is.</i>

306
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:54,432
<i>She's a...a mystery...</i>

307
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,837
<i>just as she's always been.</i>

308
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,934
<i>Just as she'll...always be.</i>

309
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,775
I...I don't <i>know</i> her.

310
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:07,443
<i>{only know her as a, as an animal</i>

311
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:11,716
<i>And nothing can or should
hold back an animal.</i>

312
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,418
Please leave a message...

313
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,052
<i>It was only then that
I began to remember</i>

314
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,656
<i>the Way that she looked
that evening.</i>

315
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,688
I re...remembered the look
on their faces...

316
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,997
<i>I remember how weakly,
pathetically and blissfully</i>

317
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:30,200
<i>she had...smiled as I came up
to the piano and how she wiped</i>

318
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:34,267
<i>the perspiration
from her blushing face.</i>

319
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,577
<i>Even</i> then...they were avoiding
each other's eyes...

320
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,881
<i>and I remember when they looked
at each other and gave each other...</i>

321
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,581
<i>a little smile.</i>

322
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,486
<i>I knew that</i> look.

323
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:50,550
<i>Those barely perceptible smiles.</i>

324
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,620
<i>There was no longer
any barrier between them.</i>

325
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,154
<i>They've done it.</i>

326
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,097
<i>They...they must have.</i>

327
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,369
<i>It's fucking obvious.
Everyone can see.</i>

328
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:10,103
<i>With horror, I recalled...</i>

329
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,842
Yes, appointments on Monday.

330
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,281
- Good morning.
- Morning, Cynthia.

331
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,909
- How are you?
- I'm good, thank you.

332
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,941
- How are you?
- I'm good.

333
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,580
I have things for you to sign...
for a change.

334
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,351
Mr. Kemp.

335
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:25,259
The 3:00, the New York investor company,
they, they canceled.

336
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,456
They're gonna call me
and reschedule for next week.

337
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,227
.., all right, thank you.

338
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,165
You're welcome.

339
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,032
Would you like some coffee?

340
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,162
I'd love some coffee.

341
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:38,334
All right.
Grande non-fat latte, right?

342
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,502
You got it.

343
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,340
Come on in.

344
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,312
Thank you.

345
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,111
Gentlemen...
All right, gentlemen.

346
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,378
Cassandra Persons.

347
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,214
This is Edgar Hudson...

348
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,310
So good to meet you.

349
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,047
Oh, Mr. Hudson.

350
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,419
A pleasure to meet you.

351
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,013
And Richard Kemp.

352
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,022
Very nice to meet you.

353
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,217
Spoke to you on the phone.

354
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,055
- That's right-nice to meet you.
- Please sit down.

355
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,358
Good to put a name to the face.

356
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,557
Thank you very much
for taking this meeting.

357
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,587
Our pleasure.

358
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,363
I've been working on this project
for the last couple of months,

359
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,125
and I reached out
to your foundation

360
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,860
'cause I was hoping
that you can help me.

361
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,102
Um, I have a friend who was just
in Africa a few months ago,

362
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,633
and he met a young boy
who was an amputee.

363
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,804
He was 10 years old.

364
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,338
There are several thousand
amputee children.

365
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,113
Because amputating the limbs
of children and all of the civilians

366
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,849
was the signature atrocity
of the R.U.F. soldiers.

367
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,653
How did these amputations
actually take place?

368
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,355
They would lay the arm on a
stump, or the leg on a stump

369
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,557
and they would actually ask
the individual

370
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,066
which one they would prefer
to have amputated...

371
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,998
Dear Lord...

372
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,232
and they would have to choose,
and upon the decision...

373
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,294
Wow.

374
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,635
It would be amputated
with a machete...

375
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,538
Sometimes by other children.

376
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,167
Wow.

377
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:51,340
And now they're 15 years old
and they have no one,

378
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,076
and so they're walking the streets.

379
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,675
And I know that there is something
that can be done for them now.

380
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,447
Sure.

381
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,751
Your foundation's been
so profound in changing medicine

382
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,418
and helping people
who need medical care,

383
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:06,691
I was hoping that you could
help me help these children.

384
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,096
We can get..., we can
get physical stuff,

385
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,999
but I'm telling you, I can hear Elinore
"Off core mission,

386
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,469
off core mission, off core mission."

387
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,732
I know, big sis is tough.

388
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,535
I know, that's why I just...

389
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,667
I don't know if we can get involved.

390
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:24,044
I mean, I think it's a really good
thing, my heart goes out to them...

391
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,139
Yeah.

392
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,650
It's just, uh...

393
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,209
Look, I'll see you after lunch.

394
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,619
But Elinore's coming today.

395
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,089
At...Yeah, absolutely.

396
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,716
What time is she coming? 3:00?

397
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,521
It's 2:30.

398
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:41,258
2:30..., I'll be there at, uh...
I'll be back at 2:15.

399
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,789
But wait, you really can't
leave me, because we have...

400
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,666
one, we have the budget,
which we haven't fixed yet.

401
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,669
The budget's not fixed yet.

402
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,229
Listen, I don't want to bring
this up to her,

403
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,171
and you can't leave me alone...

404
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,174
Cynthia, I'll see you after lunch.

405
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:57,704
You just can't leave me alone with her,
you know, for five, 10 minutes, she's...

406
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,272
I've heard this before.

407
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,181
"Be back after lunch."

408
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,207
When does he come back?

409
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,014
Next Wednesday.

410
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,625
Hey, baby.

411
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,597
Yeah.

412
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,963
No, I think he's wonderful.

413
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,989
I think he's great.

414
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,501
He's a really great choice.

415
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,266
Awesome, I know, because
I've heard him before,

416
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,738
before we started working together,

417
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,174
but this cellist, I'm telling you,
he's a total asshole.

418
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,837
I mean, he thinks he's Yo-Yo Ma,

419
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,316
but he sounds more like
Jacqueline du Pre at her farewell tour.

420
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,410
Um...

421
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,511
Yeah, that's...

422
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,316
I'm fine with that.

423
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,050
I think those are combinations...

424
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,890
And also just make sure that I
don't have some clapped-out piano,

425
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,657
like the high school piano
with a busted pin-block, ..,

426
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:50,359
because I'll sound completely amateur.

427
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:54,268
No, I, I think it makes complete sense.

428
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,501
.., so run some people by me.

429
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,337
He's great.

430
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,501
I think he's really wonderful.

431
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,068
He's a little young, but, uh...

432
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,412
but he would be a great addition.

433
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,714
Right now?

434
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,779
.., .., yeah.

435
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,951
Opportunity presents itself
for me to actually work on the piano

436
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,551
and make sure that
it's not a piece of shit,

437
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,190
because that's really gonna
present a problem for me.

438
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah, no problem.

439
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:31,064
I don't have a problem with that...

440
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,200
at all.

441
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,348
I hear everything you're saying
and I really will call you...

442
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,544
back later and we'll talk more,

443
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,248
and I'll also, you know,
make sure to check my e-mail...

444
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,656
.., thanks.

445
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,182
Thank you so much, Lena.

446
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,094
Bye. Thanks.

447
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,333
What are you doing?

448
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,166
Are you crazy?

449
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,763
God damn it, Edgar, get off of me!

450
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,933
; What?

451
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,203
You fucking came in me.

452
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,767
Are you nuts?

453
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,077
It's not fucking funny.

454
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,241
Get...

455
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,579
What are you thinking?

456
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,882
It's not funny.

457
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,081
Sorry.

458
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,783
Sorry?

459
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,785
Shh, shh, shh...

460
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,313
Oh, look...it's over.

461
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:32,089
As soon as it starts, it's over.

462
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,027
Clean up!

463
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,861
Just fucking clean it...

464
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,662
clean it up!

465
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,835
Everything has
a sharp edge, there's all these...

466
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:51,541
I have to constantly watch her...
It's really exhausting for me.

467
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:06,561
Why is this diaper on the counter?

468
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,621
Shh, shh, shh...

469
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,756
I'm trying the best that I can.

470
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,861
It's not my...
I'm not really good at it, ...?

471
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:15,700
That's ...

472
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,607
And I'm not a housekeeper...
and I'm tired of doing laundry...

473
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,938
I understand that.

474
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,645
And...l want my mom
to come see me.

475
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,178
[baby 0008,51

476
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,387
<i>What awful lies
We spread about children.</i>

477
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,988
<i>"Children are God's blessing on us.”</i>

478
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,590
<i>"Children are a delight. "</i>

479
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,932
<i>It's all fucking lies.</i>

480
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:52,067
<i>Mothers know this...and
sometimes they'll own up to it.</i>

481
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,248
You're not doing it for real!

482
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,312
What am I not doing for real?

483
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,688
I am doing it for real.

484
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,657
You are not.

485
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,165
You're being bad.

486
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,562
Stop it.

487
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,867
I said to stop it.

488
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,563
Lexi!

489
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,336
Keep saying it.

490
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,843
I said to stop.

491
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,003
I know, but you still...

492
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,206
I know, I know, .., ..

493
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,341
Will you please not bang
on the piano?

494
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,376
And we'll play like funny play.

495
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,945
- Am I crabs with you?
- Yeah.

496
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,948
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

497
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,153
No, Homer...

498
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,459
<i>Once We had
number two, that was it.</i>

499
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,657
<i>She gave up playing...</i>

500
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,966
Leave us alone.

501
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,093
Shh, shh, shh...

502
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,432
Mama...

503
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,501
<i>She Wanted a new home,
she got a new home.</i>

504
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,677
She had a...

505
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,689
<i>terrible power over me.</i>

506
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,987
<i>You don't believe that women
have that much power over us?</i>

507
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,823
Well...go into any <i>mall.</i>

508
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,889
<i>There are millions of dollars
Worth of stuff there.</i>

509
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,060
<i>You can never put a value
on the amount of labor</i>

510
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,331
<i>that's gone into producing it,
yet</i> look...

511
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,566
<i>In nine out of 10 stores,</i>

512
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,907
<i>is there even one fucking thing
a man would want to buy?</i>

513
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,379
<i>All life's luxury articles
are made to meet the demands</i>

514
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:42,441
<i>of women and to be
consumed by them.</i>

515
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,561
.., I'm coming to get ya!
I'm coming to get ya!

516
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,298
I'm coming to get ya!

517
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,566
He doesn't want this.

518
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,699
Here just take the boy...

519
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,642
Mommy...

520
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,772
I know, I know.

521
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,179
Can I cut that up?

522
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,115
He doesn't want it cut up.

523
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,846
Just...hold on one second.

524
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,956
Shh, shh, shh...

525
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,619
Hold on one second, ...?
Hold on one second, ...?

526
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,495
Desi...Desi missed his nap.

527
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,193
Now he's gonna be up all day.

528
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:35,136
It's .., I'm not blaming you, but can
you please go pick up the Porsche?

529
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,632
- Yup.
- It's on Santa Monica and 12th, ...?

530
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,508
Here's the key.

531
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,672
Just use the checkbook
that I gave you, ...?

532
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,942
And call me from the road.

533
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,950
.., thanks.

534
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,181
Honey, let's go outside
and play in the sun.

535
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,831
Oh, my God!

536
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:20,138
<i>She had grown as pretty
as the last ray of summer.</i>

537
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,185
<i>She was aware of it and started
to take an interest in her appearance.</i>

538
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,657
<i>A kind of provocative beauty
radiated from her...</i>

539
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,786
<i>and people found it disturbing.</i>

540
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:37,698
<i>She was 35 years old, in the full flower
of her Womanhood.</i>

541
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,396
Yeah...Well...and Whenever
she walked past men,

542
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,665
<i>she attracted their gaze...</i>

543
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,001
Disgusting...

544
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:49,740
<i>She was an impatient, Well-fed horse
that has had its bridle taken off...</i>

545
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,010
<i>I could sense this...
and it scared me.</i>

546
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:57,538
I don't ever see my friends.

547
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,844
You don't like them anyway.

548
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,085
I don't do anything
that I love any more.

549
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,866
And I feel so bad...

550
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,899
Because I feel like I'm making
you feel bad, and I don't want

551
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,536
to make you feel bad...

552
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,446
'cause I know you did
everything right.

553
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,814
I just...l don't understand
what you're saying.

554
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:35,749
I just...

555
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,420
Yeah?

556
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:43,220
I'm just so tired of everything.

557
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,285
What is actually wrong?

558
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,672
Is it about this?

559
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,341
It's .., it's understandable.

560
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,112
L...

561
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,349
it's not like I'm trying
to create a problem.

562
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,118
I just want my life back, ...?

563
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,389
I know you didn't take it
from me on purpose.

564
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,592
I know that it wasn't some kind
of crazy thing in your mind.

565
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,660
It's just...l gave it up...
so it's my fault, ...?

566
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:33,607
And I just need to figure out
how I'm gonna make it...

567
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,168
I just want some independence
again, that's all I want.

568
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,077
I just want to do
my own thing again.

569
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,104
I want to go out to dinner
sometimes without you,

570
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,674
and I want to sometimes not
have to take care of the kids,

571
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,152
or I want to go away with you,
without the kids.

572
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,553
I don't want to just be here.

573
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,183
I don't want to be in Beverly Hills,
I don't want to be

574
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,658
in this house 24 hours a day.

575
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,524
I don't want to be
gardening in the back.

576
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,359
I don't want to fucking run
with the dogs.

577
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,228
I don't want to do any of this stuff.

578
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,231
I want my life back.

579
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,062
I want to travel.

580
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,864
I want to go to San Francisco
or New York or go to Europe

581
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,268
or something, or just be the way

582
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,295
that things were in the beginning
between us.

583
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,172
I just...Everything is such a...
it's so orderly...

584
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,768
If you have to go...

585
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:13,305
if you have to claim some sort
of life for yourself...

586
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,146
then go.

587
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,516
I understand.

588
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,519
Why are you being so...

589
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,577
I completely understand.

590
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,647
Perfect...Oh, no.

591
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,955
I wanted to have
a fight with you.

592
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,826
We can have a fight.

593
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:27,886
Can we have a...

594
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,762
Absolutely.

595
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,563
I was planning on a good fight.

596
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,333
Well, we can have a good fight.

597
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,169
You fucking ungrateful child.

598
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,803
You spoiled Beverly Hills wife.

599
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,471
That is so true.

600
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,641
I was just thinking that
in my head.

601
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,579
That's better.

602
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,354
Hi...

603
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,951
Somebody woke up.

604
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,698
Somebody woke up.

605
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,827
Say good night to Daddy.

606
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,995
Come here, baby.

607
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,734
It's all right if I read
to you, hmm?

608
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,548
<i>I couldn't go back to sleep.</i>

609
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,743
Could I have a cab, please?

610
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:26,846
<i>I decided I couldn't stand
any more of this anxiety.</i>

611
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:34,489
<i>I would go to the airport and try
and catch the last flight back to L.A.</i>

612
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:43,167
<i>I remember the strange feeling
I had as I looked at the nape</i>

613
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,539
<i>of his neck and its White flesh
with the black hairs</i>

614
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,476
<i>as he moved away from us</i>

615
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,416
<i>with this peculiar bobbing,
almost birdlike gait.</i>

616
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,715
<i>I'm not exaggerating
when I tell you</i>

617
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:02,690
<i>this man's presence
drove me out of my mind.</i>

618
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,555
Hi.

619
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,355
Edgar Hudson.

620
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,325
Pleased to meet you.

621
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,419
Hello.

622
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,656
And Richard Kemp.

623
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,629
Hi. Richard.

624
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:09,926
- Nice to meet you.
- Yup.

625
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,524
Hmm...Thank you.

626
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,159
And, um...and a CD, but...

627
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,363
I hope you'll play for us live.

628
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,700
Yeah, ...

629
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,001
Where should I set up?

630
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,735
Does it matter? Should I...

631
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,037
- Right here?
- Uh, right...

632
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,136
Wherever you're comfortable.

633
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,613
This will be the first time violin
has been played in this office,

634
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,378
I think, so we don't really have...

635
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,884
- But not the last.
- ...a violin place.

636
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,753
So I think he will be perfect
for the benefit.

637
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,983
This is why we keep her.

638
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,930
But Aiden is multi-talented.

639
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,796
He and I met at the gym
in a capoeira class.

640
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,665
Oh, really?

641
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,761
- He helped me with my ginga.
- I did.

642
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,864
Ginga? What's ginga?

643
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,637
It means "swing".
You just swing a little bit.

644
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,440
- Swing?
- Yeah.

645
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,108
I'm not really a music guy,
but, uh, play something to impress us.

646
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,083
Play something to impress you.

647
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:08,275
{should have made sure
<i>I</i> never set eyes on him again.

648
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,945
Um, and there are no boarding passes
here for me to pick up.

649
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,648
<i>But that was like saying
I was afraid of him.</i>

650
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,816
<i>He didn't scare me.</i>

651
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:19,157
<i>I'm not that pathetic.</i>

652
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:24,724
<i>So I introduced him to my Wife.</i>

653
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,200
Abby

654
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,634
This is Aiden.

655
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:34,234
Um, it was quite
a day, quite a week that week.

656
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,507
We had broken down
a couple of times in our jeep

657
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,672
and we were told that...

658
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,181
I was told that I needed
to name the school.

659
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,445
They were gifting me
with the school.

660
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:46,751
And upon leaving the school,
I ran past, or we drove past,

661
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,486
a huge abandoned diamond mine,

662
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,154
and I don't know if you've ever
seen a diamond mine before...

663
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:57,154
It's a huge, gaping hole
with about 16 feet of water,

664
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:02,398
and...stagnant, still water,
um, you know, infested,

665
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:07,102
and in the middle of that
there were five lily pads,

666
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,338
and in the center of that there was
a gorgeous lotus flower...

667
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,573
- Wow.
- Fully bloomed in the middle.

668
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,209
And so, needless to say, um,
I thought of the adage,

669
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,220
"the muddier the water, the more
beautiful the lotus flower..."

670
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,619
Oh, I love that.

671
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:20,781
And I decided...
Oh, so that's...

672
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,519
to name the school
the muddy lotus.

673
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,729
So what piece of music do you
think would be appropriate

674
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,562
for such a wonderful charity?

675
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,899
Um...Well, I think we have
a few options.

676
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,099
Uh, there's, uh, Barber,
Opers...Opus 14,

677
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,369
which I think would be
lovely to play.

678
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,535
Um, there's...

679
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,374
I hope you're
not looking at me.

680
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,074
Yeah, well...isn't that what it...
what it's supposed to be?

681
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,343
What was the setup here?

682
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,372
I can't play...

683
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,646
- That's what I was told, was that...
- I used to play,

684
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,245
I went to Juilliard and I,
and I have to say,

685
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,347
I still play a little bit, but...

686
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,824
If you went to Juilliard,
you don't play just a little bit

687
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,656
You should play
with somebody that you...

688
00:46:58,682 --> 00:46:59,490
that's currently working
like you are.

689
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,961
Come on...Cynthia,
she said you're amazing.

690
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,928
That's true.

691
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,865
She's wonderful.
- So?

692
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,266
Well, it's not like I can't
step up to the challenge.

693
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,668
What other piece?

694
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:12,731
What I want to play...
uh, is the Kreutzer Sonata.

695
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:13,867
Oh, I don't know it.

696
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,173
Well, that's obviously a very
strong violin piece, so you can

697
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,771
play it by yourself, because I
don't think I could ever...

698
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,872
really pull that off.

699
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,144
It's, it's...a lot of broken chords,
there's a lot of arpeggio...

700
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,242
Arpeggios?

701
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,578
What are arpeggios?

702
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,216
Well, it was supposed to call...
supposed to be called the Bridgetower...

703
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,224
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

704
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,191
Very interesting.

705
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,353
Why is that?

706
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:37,388
Bridgetower is this, uh,
West Indian violinist,

707
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,301
and, um, he's incredible, he's got
these humongous hands

708
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,271
and he could just, you know,
span the violin,

709
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:47,537
and he and Beethoven
form a friendship...

710
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,408
and they play the piece
which will ostensibly become

711
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,209
the Kreutzer...Kreutzer Sonata.
- Oh.

712
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,150
But then Beethoven and
Bridgetower get into a bit of a spat,

713
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,847
and...they go out to a bar,
they're drinking,

714
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,289
there's too much talking, and what it
says in, in sort of the history books

715
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,919
is that Bridgetower besmirched
some woman's honor.

716
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:06,825
Besmirched?

717
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,024
Besmirched, which is
a lovely word...

718
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,031
I don't think that happened.

719
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,159
What I think happened
was that Bridgetower

720
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,761
slept with one
of Beethoven's exes.

721
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,294
Beethoven, consumed
with jealousy...

722
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,431
Exactly.

723
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,669
Couldn't keep his women,
could he?

724
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,234
So he basically...
Yeah, I think that Bridgetower slept

725
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,371
with one Beethoven's exes

726
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,405
and therefore Beethoven
kicked him off the, the Kreutzer,

727
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,677
he takes the piece, he sends it off,

728
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,118
um...he sends it to Rodolphe Kreutzer,
who lives in Paris,

729
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:37,091
and...basically Kreutzer takes
a look at this sonata

730
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,354
and he declares it unplayable.

731
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,794
He says, "It's too hard,
I can't do it, forget about it."

732
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:41,989
And now you've come to me...

733
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:42,656
- Exactly.
- ...a mother...

734
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,962
to play piano?
Forget it.

735
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:45,966
It's not gonna happen.

736
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,559
He never ever played it?

737
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,831
Not, not to my knowledge.

738
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,837
Well, wonderful, great.

739
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,498
I don't think I could...
Darling...

740
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,565
Oh, come on. Please.

741
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,667
Please, please.

742
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,803
Four, one...

743
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,436
Yeah, right there.

744
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,879
I had to be nice to him or I'd...

745
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,280
<i>I'd kill him on the spot.</i>

746
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,545
Now sustain that...

747
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:03,710
<i>but I was in hell...</i>

748
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,083
Enjoy the chord.- ..

749
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,180
<i>Because I could tell...
the beast inside them both</i>

750
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:14,093
<i>that didn't give a fuck
what was nice or proper or,</i>

751
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,255
or what anyone thought...

752
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,889
Two, three, four...

753
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,333
<i>had asked, "Can we?”
and replied, "Oh, yes, certainly. "</i>

754
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,392
That's why...

755
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,631
Uh-oh, the hair's going back.

756
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,374
<i>"The only problem is getting your
insufferable husband out of the Way."</i>

757
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:28,034
four...

758
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,093
You can play with that one, ...?

759
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,891
Desi, you can play that one,
and I can play this one.

760
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,742
Quiet! Quiet!

761
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:28,392
<i>It was obvious that the music was
meant to drown out their voices...</i>

762
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,696
<i>maybe their kisses</i> too.

763
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,463
My God.

764
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,171
Watch where you're going!

765
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,877
Stop! Come back!

766
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:49,781
No!

767
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,080
Stop. Hey!

768
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,850
Both of you, back in the kitchen.

769
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,151
Go, go, go, 90, 90, 90

770
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:55,952
go, go, go!

771
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,322
Take the dogs. Take the dogs.

772
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:58,826
Go, both of you, out.

773
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,557
Edgar, come back here
and take the dogs, please.

774
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,065
Lexi! Lexi! Come back!

775
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,795
Lexi, come here.

776
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,599
Lexi!

777
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,604
Just like Juilliard...

778
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,331
Right, right.

779
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,674
Right, right...

780
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,941
No, I don't think so.

781
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,884
It's not a "sem-eye"
but a "sem-ee."

782
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,752
I'm so sorry.

783
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,384
I'm so very sorry.

784
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,596
I'm so very sorry.

785
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,122
Ah, it is what it is.

786
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,190
It is what it is.

787
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,530
We got good work in.

788
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:43,436
In fact, we got
very good work in.

789
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,462
See you later.

790
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,838
Good-bye, fuzzy one.

791
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,103
Good-bye.

792
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,109
Kiss her boo-boo.

793
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,406
Where? Oh...

794
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,061
Right now, just sit back,
relax, enjoy the flight.

795
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,130
What time are you
going out tonight?

796
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,903
Tonight I'm going out
around seven.

797
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:21,875
And what is his name?

798
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:22,706
Stephen.

799
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,973
She has a very hot date tonight.

800
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,173
I have a date.

801
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,011
Do you?

802
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:27,845
That I do.

803
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,408
Do you want to tell us
a little bit about it?

804
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,716
Not yet, but I'm going out.

805
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,618
Very late?

806
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,520
You're on your own, yeah.

807
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,616
What are you doing today?

808
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,388
I am going to the office.

809
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,020
What are you doing?

810
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,190
- I'm rehearsing.
- Again?

811
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,255
At home today.

812
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,460
Didn't you rehearse
enough last night?

813
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,400
We couldn't get anything
done last night, because you

814
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,529
couldn't keep control over...

815
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,799
Come on, I was taking care...

816
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,932
Edgar, I'm just saying that
I couldn't get anything done

817
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,068
last night because of the fact
that you were...

818
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,668
everything was mayhem here.

819
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,976
What are you talking about?
I was completely helping you out...

820
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,812
Don't raise your voice, please.

821
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,318
You let them run into the room
and distract me, and it's difficult,

822
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,617
so we're gonna just
do it during the day

823
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:10,386
when you're not here
and no one's here...?

824
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,915
Fine. Good.

825
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,894
Mama...

826
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,396
Who's this?

827
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,159
Is this Thomas?

828
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,066
Oh, this is, uh, Edward.

829
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,405
Desi, it's .., baby.

830
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,102
We're gonna go play in the park.

831
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,907
It's .., honey.

832
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:36,207
Park-it's your favorite thing.

833
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,817
Go, go, go!

834
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,586
Run, run, run!

835
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,853
Go play, go play, go play!

836
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,121
I'll be back in an hour.

837
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:52,764
Aiden.

838
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,767
Oh, my God.

839
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,997
That little one is so adorable.

840
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,166
So, basically, these are
the children of the diamond miners.

841
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:02,870
Their parents make a dollar
and 33 cents a day and a cup of rice.

842
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,641
Not only is that not enough
for them, it's not enough for them

843
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,876
to feed or take care
of their children.

844
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:11,716
And these are the types of
conditions that breed war

845
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,448
and civil strife.

846
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:17,185
And now, each and every day
these children are being fed,

847
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,853
and before they were going four
and five days without eating.

848
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,159
The things,
the things we take for granted.

849
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,722
Look, this is the salutation
that they do every time we walk

850
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,097
into the classroom.

851
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,398
It's "good morning," and...

852
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,371
it's in their native language...

853
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,840
which means "We love you, good morning,
and welcome to our class."

854
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,503
Now, these are some pictures
that we've taken collectively.

855
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,409
And you're pretty good.

856
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,471
You guys are pretty good
photographers.

857
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,914
Well, it was
inspirational, I mean...

858
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:42,916
So great.

859
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,043
This is the village.

860
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,382
Those are parents.

861
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,443
Look at all the colors.

862
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,719
I mean, just incredible,
the smiles everywhere.

863
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,225
Never seen anything like it.

864
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,785
Sometimes amid
very terrible conditions, but still...

865
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,458
Oh, yeah, I just want to make sure
I got everything with you.

866
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,491
.., so yeah, we got
the textbooks...

867
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,366
We were able to get the textbooks
from the minister of education...

868
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,373
they allotted us with
400 textbooks for now,

869
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,773
but we're doing really good,
and we have...

870
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,799
<i>I lost control
of my imagination.</i>

871
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:14,304
<i>It began to paint for me,
in the most lurid fashion,</i>

872
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:19,480
<i>a rapid sequence of pictures
showing what had gone on</i>

873
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,183
<i>when I Wasn't around...</i>

874
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,590
<i>when the kids weren't around.</i>

875
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:28,187
<i>They were alone in the house,
in my...bed.</i>

876
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:33,600
<i>I was consumed with rage,
indignation,</i>

877
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:38,504
<i>and a kind of strange, drunken
enjoyment of my hurt pride</i>

878
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:43,443
<i>as I contemplated
these pictures, but</i> I...

879
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,844
<i>I couldn't tear myself
away from them.</i>

880
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:52,787
<i>The more I contemplated these
imaginary pictures,</i>

881
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,050
<i>the more I believed
they were real.</i>

882
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,506
Hi.

883
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,539
Hi.

884
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:09,645
The Internet in the office
broke down,

885
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,057
so I decided to do
some work here.

886
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:12,855
Good.

887
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:14,853
Good.

888
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,269
See ya, Aiden.

889
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,750
Hi.

890
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,284
I'm gonna go to the store.

891
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,733
Hey.

892
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,311
You all right?

893
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,681
Yeah, I'm good.

894
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,960
<i>What was really
so awful was that I felt</i>

895
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:37,692
<i>that I owned her body,</i>

896
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,463
<i>as if it were my own, but I had
no control over this body.</i>

897
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,563
It...didn't belong to me.

898
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:49,543
<i>She could do with it Whatever
the fuck she Wanted.</i>

899
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:54,036
<i>I couldn't do a thing
to stop her or him.</i>

900
01:02:54,070 --> 01:03:00,680
<i>Even if she hadn't cheated
on me, I knew she Wanted to,</i>

901
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:05,284
<i>and that made it Worse.</i>

902
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,659
<i>It...would have been better
if she'd actually done it</i>

903
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:14,032
<i>in front of me so that I would
have known for sure,</i>

904
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:19,472
<i>but I Wanted her to stop Wanting
what she couldn't help Wanting.</i>

905
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:26,208
<i>It...it was complete
and utter madness.</i>

906
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:49,298
I'm going to sleep.

907
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,207
What is your problem?

908
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,772
Nothing.

909
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:03,806
Nothing at all.

910
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,786
I'm tired.

911
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,835
I read somewhere that, uh...

912
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,836
playing the Kreutzer Sonata
is like a...

913
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:37,318
is like a, is like a dance,
like a...almost like having sex

914
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,581
with somebody.

915
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:43,751
Is that true?

916
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,884
Have you heard that?

917
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,154
Have you heard that?

918
01:04:56,158 --> 01:05:00,573
I don't have anything
to say about that.

919
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,598
No.

920
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,107
What are you getting at?

921
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:10,481
I don't understand.

922
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,749
I read that...
playing the Kreutzer Sonata...

923
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,814
Oh, give me
a fucking break, Edgar.

924
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:25,157
You're asking me if I, if I've got
some kind of fascination going on.

925
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,188
Just say it.

926
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:30,227
Why don't you just say it?

927
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,899
I saw what you did.

928
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,603
I don't appreciate
what you did, ...?

929
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,110
How do you know what I did?

930
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,305
Because I could see,

931
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,871
I could see that you went
through my bag.

932
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,849
I know where I left my phone.

933
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,182
I, I know that you go
through my things.

934
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:49,019
I'm aware of that.

935
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,025
I just came across
the phone tonight.

936
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,424
No, that's not true.

937
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,359
You've gone through
my journals before.

938
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:59,196
That's why you can't
find them anywhere.

939
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,393
You know my password.

940
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,563
That's why you always kiss me
when I'm on my e-mail.

941
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,698
What do you think
I've done, ...?

942
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,871
I don't want to have
sex with you right now, ...?

943
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:17,509
I'm not attracted to you.

944
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,541
What bothers you?

945
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,076
That I actually have,

946
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:23,454
that I'm having an interesting
relationship where I'm speaking

947
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,016
to somebody that I have
something in common with?

948
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:30,656
I saw a fucking
ton of messages!

949
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:34,828
All between you and Aiden.

950
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:38,361
Tons! One fucking after another!

951
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,200
What the fuck do these
messages mean?

952
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,839
Stop it.
Stop it!

953
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,246
What do they all mean?

954
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,114
What is the problem?
What is wrong with you?

955
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,552
What is wrong with you?
What is the problem?

956
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:57,353
That I might actually just be
enjoying myself, ...?

957
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,757
I'm not doing anything wrong.

958
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,887
Whatever it is that you think
is going on is not going on.

959
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,455
That's part of your problem
is that you're so fucking insecure.

960
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,991
What?

961
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,934
Just leave me alone.

962
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,416
Sorry.

963
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,248
I'm sorry.

964
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,388
It's him.

965
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,331
What?

966
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,197
It's him.

967
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,702
No. No.

968
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,830
It is him.

969
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,840
No, it's not.

970
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,500
It's you.

971
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,944
I can see it is him.

972
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:56,848
Edgar...it's you.

973
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,146
You're insecure.

974
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,312
I can fucking see it.

975
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,979
Don't.

976
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,580
I can see it.

977
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:05,555
I can see it.

978
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,152
Stop it.

979
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,128
I'm sorry.

980
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,653
I didn't mean to do that.

981
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:15,396
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

982
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:19,501
Funny piece of music.

983
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:22,441
I can't get...l can't get it
out of my head.

984
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,376
I'll stop. I'll stop.

985
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,108
I don't have to do this,
I told you.

986
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,173
This was your idea.

987
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,149
Yeah.

988
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,412
You brought this idea to me.

989
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,046
Yes.

990
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,955
And I wanted to do it,
but I don't have to do it.

991
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,424
I want you to do it.

992
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,927
No. I don't have to do it.

993
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,931
It's not like I'm starting
a career again.

994
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:44,693
It's been fun.

995
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,290
I, I don't...

996
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,302
But why not?

997
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,634
It's making me go crazy.

998
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,604
Has the music...
has that ever happened to you?

999
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,181
As a musician, I mean as a musician,
has that ever happened

1000
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,445
to you where it just...

1001
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,975
where it just, like, kills you?

1002
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:09,820
It just, like, just goes into your head
just like a fucking drill.

1003
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:14,351
Just like...just like consumes
who you are, your spirit.

1004
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,453
No? No?

1005
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,292
Mm-mm.

1006
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,492
No?

1007
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,526
Can't you just stop
talking about it?

1008
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,034
You know what?
I want it to be unobtrusive.

1009
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,067
I don't want it to be, like,
front and center.

1010
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:32,875
With a bucket?

1011
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:33,903
Yeah...with a big bucket.

1012
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:39,618
.., um, first of all,
I'd like to thank all of you

1013
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,552
for coming today.

1014
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,420
Uh, I know that many of you have
traveled considerable distances

1015
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:47,689
to be here, some from as far afield
as other parts of Beverly Hills.

1016
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:53,665
And I'd especially like to thank
Edgar Hudson and his foundation

1017
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,465
for hosting this lunch here
in his tiny garden

1018
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,405
behind his cramped
and run-down home.

1019
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,501
And for those of you
who don't know him well,

1020
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,909
Edgar is wealthy and cultured.

1021
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,346
He has a beautiful wife and
two unbelievably sweet kids.

1022
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:12,011
I swear to God, I just want you to know
how much we all hate you.

1023
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,318
Money is energy,
and energetically all of you

1024
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:19,884
are here because you want to do
something to help someone else in need.

1025
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,395
<i>I thanked him
for the pleasure he had given me</i>

1026
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:25,194
<i>and said a final good-bye.</i>

1027
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,222
<i>Everything was fine.</i>

1028
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:30,670
<i>My Wife and I were both
very pleased with the Way</i>

1029
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,671
the evening had gone,

1030
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:35,039
<i>and We'd never see him again.</i>

1031
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,656
Look, I don't want to be an asshole
and say I told you so...

1032
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:58,824
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

1033
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,926
I have Elinore on line one.

1034
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,961
Um...tell her I'll call her.

1035
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,702
I know, I know she called,
I know she called several times.

1036
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,038
Tell her I'll call her back.

1037
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,238
Don't worry about it.

1038
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,442
Look, like I was saying,
I'm not trying to be an asshole

1039
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,782
and say I told you so,
but there's only so much I can do.

1040
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,650
I'm on your mandate.
I'm on Elinore's mandate.

1041
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,555
You, you have to go up there.
I can't do it.

1042
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,990
What's, what's, what's
gonna happen to the school

1043
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:29,928
if there's a delay?

1044
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,228
Well, we'll lose
the trust of the local government,

1045
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:34,666
for one thing, which was hard won.

1046
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,395
Right.

1047
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:38,530
I don't know...l don't know if they'll
let us back in after, you know.

1048
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,368
Darling, hi.

1049
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,739
Um, I'm not gonna be able to
make the symphony tonight.

1050
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,903
Why don't you invite a friend?

1051
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,173
Um, or, hey, why don't you
invite Aiden?

1052
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,978
I, you know, he's, he's, um,
leaving tonight, so I'm sure

1053
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:52,246
he's gonna be going out
with his friends

1054
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,754
and painting the town red.

1055
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:55,619
All right, all right.

1056
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,386
Well, see if you can find a friend.
Otherwise, cancel the tickets.

1057
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,485
I'm gonna be back
in a couple of days.

1058
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,894
I've got to do some
damage control with sis.

1059
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,228
All right? No, it's all-
Everything's fine.

1060
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,131
I'll call, I'll call you on my travels.

1061
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,067
All right, all right, bye.

1062
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,570
<i>After having said good-bye
to my Wife</i>

1063
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:13,630
<i>in the best and
most tranquil of moods,</i>

1064
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,734
<i>I headed up north to see my sister.</i>

1065
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,541
<i>She was bent out of shape
about the school in Sierra Leone</i>

1066
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,775
<i>and ultimately she controlled
the family foundation,</i>

1067
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:24,580
<i>but I was confident
I could placate her.</i>

1068
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:25,914
Airport.

1069
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:29,320
We are currently at Homeland
Security threat level orange.

1070
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,299
He can call me, but I
may have my phone switched off,

1071
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:50,299
in which case he can leave
a message and I'll call him back.

1072
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,938
All right...

1073
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,379
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1074
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,477
You can almost see
the bridge from here.

1075
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:01,419
Oh, yeah.

1076
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,755
Are you married?

1077
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:04,484
Yes, I am.

1078
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:07,653
Please leave
a message and I'll call you back.

1079
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,254
At the tone,
please record your message...

1080
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:11,525
Are you?

1081
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,693
I was.

1082
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:17,465
Hi, darling, it's me.

1083
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,563
I got your text.

1084
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:22,736
I was just, um, interested to
see who the mystery date was.

1085
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,835
Um, call me.

1086
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,504
I'm, I'm on my phone.

1087
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,740
Thanks, bye.

1088
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,646
<i>This text was a bit
of a surprise.</i>

1089
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,708
Its whole tone seemed
forced to me.

1090
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:36,883
<i>I could feel myself starting to spiral
again, but I checked my emotions.</i>

1091
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,722
<i>I was being ridiculous.</i>

1092
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,957
<i>Nothing could be more normal
than her taking a trip to the theater.</i>

1093
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,089
What was your name again?

1094
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,029
Dave. Dave Sizemore.

1095
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:45,997
Dave Sizemore?

1096
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,329
Sizemore Cars.

1097
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,664
Oh, it's your own service?

1098
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,566
Yes.

1099
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,661
Well, congratulations.

1100
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,330
Thank you.

1101
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,499
What do you do?

1102
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,634
Which explained why we
couldn't get on the bridge,

1103
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,075
and they were on the other side,

1104
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,806
the side which looks out
to the sea...

1105
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,438
Right. Right, right, right.

1106
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,278
It's one of those
landmarks, you know?

1107
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:06,047
You, you have to go to it if you live...
Don't you think it's strange?

1108
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:09,715
You live somewhere, and normally
the tourist place in the area

1109
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:12,817
is the place that you never go to.

1110
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:13,826
Yes.

1111
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:16,022
I mean, you live
in Los Angeles, right?

1112
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:16,825
Yes.

1113
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,196
Have you ever been
to Disneyland?

1114
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,666
Far too many times.

1115
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,999
That's not a good example.

1116
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:23,969
That's a bad one.

1117
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,198
The Robin Williams gag?

1118
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:28,231
You know, how like there's
a voice on the side of the tunnel

1119
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:32,405
saying, "No black people
beyond this point"

1120
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,812
because it's Marin-so white.

1121
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:37,044
Really, people here are
just much more pretentious,

1122
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:39,575
'cause it's actually quite
provincial around here.

1123
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,451
Do you know what I mean?

1124
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:45,789
.You think that the women here
are, are going to be smarter,

1125
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,589
but really they're not.

1126
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:52,429
They're even-you know,
they may be wearing sensible shoes...

1127
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,201
Edgar

1128
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,165
You're looking thin.

1129
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,568
Lost some weight.

1130
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:31,832
I try to work out.

1131
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,736
Really?

1132
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,799
<i>The trail was smooth,
the light was bright,</i>

1133
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,540
<i>and the air was clear and pure.</i>

1134
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:42,139
<i>I really enjoyed the ride.</i>

1135
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:45,549
<i>I forgot the terrible thing
that awaited</i> me...

1136
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,612
<i>or maybe I knew only too Well
Where I was headed,</i>

1137
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:53,320
<i>and was saying a last good-bye
to the joys of life.</i>

1138
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,397
Did y'all have a good ride?

1139
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,406
Yeah, we did.

1140
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:15,280
<i>But this tranquility, this ability
to deny the awful truth,</i>

1141
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:20,117
<i>evaporated as soon
as the ride was over.</i>

1142
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,246
Feel your back?

1143
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:22,653
A little wobbly in the legs.

1144
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:26,455
Well, if you only stayed
up here for a little while...

1145
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,892
we could get you fit.

1146
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,827
They got a workout,
didn't they.

1147
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,057
Yeah, they did.

1148
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,533
'Cause this is the first...
hottest day ever.

1149
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,934
Who's a good girl?

1150
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,941
Here, Edgar, I'll take that.

1151
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:55,415
Thank you.

1152
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,422
Fresh mint.

1153
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,988
God, listen to those frogs.

1154
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,019
Yeah.

1155
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:05,224
Look.

1156
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,358
You think they're fucking?

1157
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,494
Yes.

1158
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,842
So, Edgar, I've been wanting
to talk to you.

1159
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:28,477
Why are you sending funds
to Sierra Leone?

1160
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,921
Seems like a worthy cause.

1161
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:34,894
It's, uh, schools, books,
clothes, children.

1162
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,520
Uh-huh.

1163
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:40,021
We agreed that these investments
were going into medical...

1164
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:43,764
medical investments, not about
saving starving children.

1165
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,829
And if you want to talk about
starving children,

1166
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,205
I'll talk to you
about starving children.

1167
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,642
There are starving children
all over Los Angeles,

1168
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,270
all over California.

1169
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,473
There's a lot of rural poverty
going on here...

1170
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,881
Well, we can try
to take care of them too.

1171
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,545
Plus which, you don't seem
to have a passion for it.

1172
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:03,112
You don't seem to really have a,
an enthusiasm for it.

1173
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:09,790
You seem...quiet and withdrawn
and thin and kind of,

1174
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,731
if you'll forgive me, dull.

1175
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:20,235
I, I'm searching for you,
and I don't know who you are.

1176
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,707
You don't feel like my brother.

1177
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:26,338
You don't feel like the brother
that I had fun with.

1178
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:31,249
I don't want to beat you up,
but it's like talking to a fucking wall.

1179
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:38,780
I love you, Edgar.

1180
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,885
I'm worried about you.

1181
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:47,734
You want to tell me
what's going on?

1182
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,607
I really hate it when you
shut me out, you know that?

1183
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:06,609
I had a friend, you know,
who was suicidal.

1184
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,117
I asked her to come down
to the beach with me,

1185
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,750
and she was very reluctant.

1186
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,022
Didn't want to go to the beach.

1187
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,724
She didn't want to go
to the beach because it was

1188
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,428
a bright summer's day and there
were about 30,000 people

1189
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,060
on the beach, if not more.

1190
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,229
Maybe 300,000.

1191
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:29,038
I don't know what 30,000 looks like.

1192
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:33,570
And we were walking along the sand,
and I was shouting at her,

1193
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,878
"Look up! Look up!"

1194
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:39,181
and she was walking along the sand,
looking at her own feet.

1195
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,551
That's what you're doing.

1196
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:49,887
And there are 300- or 30,000
other people out there,

1197
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:54,367
all of them, you know,
with their own problems and...

1198
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:59,031
they're all putting on their sun block
and looking after their children

1199
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,507
and making sand castles
and living lives,

1200
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,943
and you're looking at your feet.

1201
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:16,346
I just hope you're talking
to someone.

1202
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,257
'Cause from where I sit...

1203
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:22,785
that looks like a lonely seat.

1204
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:30,669
<i>It all started up again.</i>

1205
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:34,731
<i>"How often I've tortured myself
like this, ”l said to myself.</i>

1206
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:38,506
<i>Yet every time,
it was a false alarm.</i>

1207
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,736
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back...Thanks.

1208
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,404
At the tone,
please record your message.

1209
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:15,210
Hello, honey. Hi.

1210
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:16,215
Hi, it's me.

1211
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,740
Just wondering where you were.

1212
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:19,774
Just trying to reach you.

1213
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:25,053
Suppose you've already gone
to the...to the theater.

1214
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,684
All right, talk to you later.

1215
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,423
Bye.

1216
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:33,297
Where the hell is she?

1217
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,460
Fucking bitch.

1218
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:39,632
Fucking bitch, fucking bitch.

1219
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,067
I hear you.

1220
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:47,569
I hear you.

1221
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:53,075
Believe me, I've had more years
of my life ruined by women

1222
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:55,918
who I thought were great...

1223
01:21:55,944 --> 01:22:00,324
than, than years when
I've felt happy.

1224
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:01,725
You just can't get happy.

1225
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,390
There is no way you can
really please a woman.

1226
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:10,859
As men, we try our hardest,
and in many ways, we think

1227
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:14,396
that we're the ones in control,

1228
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,808
but the truth is, we're not
in control at all.

1229
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,675
We're in control of nothing!

1230
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:20,679
Absolutely nothing!

1231
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,682
It's women who are in control
of everything,

1232
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,846
but it's an insidious way
of controlling.

1233
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,949
It's kind of, you wake up one
morning, and you suddenly

1234
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:36,258
realize you have been totally
fucking pussy-whipped.

1235
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:40,164
To be honest, I feel like a dickhead
just talking about this.

1236
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:41,098
It's all right.

1237
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:42,032
You're probably...

1238
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,504
you're probably right, Dave.

1239
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,100
And you might as well be dead.

1240
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,701
And that's what they want anyway.

1241
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:53,144
Do you want me to pull over?

1242
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,146
No, I'm fine.

1243
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:00,283
So, once you've realized that,
you think to yourself,

1244
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,447
"What am I doing?
What am I doing?

1245
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:06,084
I might as well just be going out
and getting a hooker."

1246
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:09,584
The only thing is is I'm married
to a hooker, and I'm not likely

1247
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:14,589
to get syphilis, gonorrhea, AIDS,
or you know, my cock won't drop off,

1248
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,533
because I'm married to her.

1249
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:18,570
Now you're laughing.

1250
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:19,765
See, that's what I wanted.

1251
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:20,568
Yeah.

1252
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,939
I wanted to cheer you up,
and I've cheered you up.

1253
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:23,942
You feel better?

1254
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,273
Thank you, David, thank you.

1255
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,005
Thank you.

1256
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:26,876
I feel better too.

1257
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:28,972
I feel better that you feel better.

1258
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,975
I really feel so glad and
relieved to see you laughing,

1259
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,421
but I tell you what you do need
to do tonight, and it was

1260
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:39,050
something that somebody helped
me with when I was feeling down

1261
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,115
in this town.

1262
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,218
Do you want to know?

1263
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,284
Sure.

1264
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,024
There are some really
great pubs here.

1265
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,690
It's really down to earth.

1266
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:50,169
You pay a certain amount
of money for a lap dance.

1267
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,171
It's like buying a raffle ticket.

1268
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,571
In Britain they call them
raffle tickets, you know,

1269
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,166
village fetes and things like that?

1270
01:23:56,197 --> 01:24:00,407
Buy these little tickets, and
you buy, oh, a ticket that's,

1271
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,039
you know, for like 15 bucks you
get a lap dance,

1272
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,949
60 bucks you get a blow job

1273
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,884
It's like 300 bucks, you get
the whole thing,

1274
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,252
and it's so tasteful,
people from Japan use it.

1275
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,756
Oh, really?

1276
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:11,382
Yeah, it's great.

1277
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,221
I don't think that's...

1278
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,124
It may not be to your taste, but...

1279
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:15,355
- I don't think so.
- No?

1280
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,761
<i>We've been told a lie, all of us.</i>

1281
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:24,101
<i>We've been told sex is good,
sex is fun, sex is all you need.</i>

1282
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,900
<i>Is it?</i>

1283
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:28,601
Look into <i>my</i> soul...

1284
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:34,273
<i>and look at the devils
that are tearing it apart.</i>

1285
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:37,476
<i>Now tell me it's all
so fucking Wonderful.</i>

1286
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:39,485
Hi, Ginger, it's Edgar.

1287
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:40,542
How are you?

1288
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,485
Very good, thank you.

1289
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:42,487
Good, good.

1290
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,512
Um, when did she leave?

1291
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,890
Uh...around 6:30?

1292
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,326
Who'd she leave with?

1293
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:49,794
Aiden, I think.

1294
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,025
All right.

1295
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,259
All right, Ginger, thanks.

1296
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:59,971
Sorry I missed your call.

1297
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:00,972
Please leave a message.

1298
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:18,415
Hello.

1299
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:21,086
Hi. Is she back yet?

1300
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,995
No, um, she called.

1301
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:26,157
She'll be back around 11:15.

1302
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,167
Oh. All right.

1303
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,862
I'll, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1304
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,872
Thanks.

1305
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,825
Sorry I missed your call.

1306
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:33,094
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

1307
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,998
Sorry I missed your call.

1308
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:09,199
<i>I</i> was cold.

1309
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,797
<i>My jaw started to shake</i>

1310
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:17,242
<i>My teeth rattled.</i>

1311
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:20,337
<i>I shuffled forward mechanically.</i>

1312
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:25,883
<i>What were my thoughts?</i>

1313
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,352
<i>What did I Want?</i>

1314
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:34,458
<i>I've absolutely no idea.</i>

1315
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:43,493
<i>All I knew was that some terrible
and very important event</i>

1316
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:47,097
<i>was about to take place in my life.</i>

1317
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,965
Oh...

1318
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:09,300
<i>I could hardly breathe.</i>

1319
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:13,472
<i>So here it Was, for real.</i>

1320
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:17,347
<i>No imagination.</i>

1321
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:25,654
<i>I had a strange feeling of joy
that my pain was about to end,</i>

1322
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:31,790
<i>that I'd be able to give
my hatred free rein.</i>

1323
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:35,062
<i>And indeed I did.</i>

1324
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:40,089
<i>I became a Wild beast,
a ferocious and cunning Wild beast.</i>

1325
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:48,642
<i>It</i> was almost...

1326
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:52,549
<i>an out-of-body experience.</i>

1327
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:58,387
<i>I acted precisely, unhurriedly,</i>

1328
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:03,225
<i>but Without Wasting a moment</i>

1329
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:07,825
<i>and with only one outcome in view.</i>

1330
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:53,303
Lexi and Desi?

1331
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,705
<i>When people tell you that
they don't remember what they did</i>

1332
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:59,371
<i>when they were
in a mad fit of rage...</i>

1333
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,640
<i>don't believe a Word of it.</i>

1334
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,615
<i>It's, it's all lies, bullshit.</i>

1335
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,381
<i>I remembered everything afterward,
and I've never stopped remembering it,</i>

1336
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:10,855
<i>not for one millisecond.</i>

1337
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:13,518
The more <i>steam my</i> rage got up,

1338
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:16,426
<i>the more brilliantly some kind
of light flared up inside me,</i>

1339
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:20,023
<i>making me hyper conscious
of every detail.</i>

1340
01:35:45,606 --> 01:35:46,880
Edgar

1341
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,414
Edgar

1342
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:53,152
No...

1343
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,716
HO...

1344
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,126
no!

1345
01:35:58,686 --> 01:35:59,756
Ohh!

1346
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,643
<i>Looking at her battered face,</i>

1347
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:16,443
<i>for the first time I forgot
about myself,</i> my...

1348
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,575
<i>injured pride.</i>

1349
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:24,750
<i>For the first time I saw her
as a, as a human being.</i>

1350
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,726
<i>And so insignificant
did all that had hurt me</i>

1351
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:30,661
and made me jealous now seem,

1352
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:34,655
<i>and so terrible what I'd done,</i>

1353
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:36,827
<i>and I realized that I'd never know</i>

1354
01:36:36,857 --> 01:36:41,772
<i>Whether or not she had
been unfaithful, and Worse,</i>

1355
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,777
<i>it didn't even matter any more.</i>

1356
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,904
Is that blood?

1357
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:49,244
Forgive me...

1358
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:54,212
I have to tell you something...
