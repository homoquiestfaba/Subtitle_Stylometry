1
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,318
       Come on, let's go!
       It's getting cold.

2
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,953
    Just a few more minutes.

3
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,600
    Did you guys hear that?

4
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,755
    No, no, no, no, no, no!

5
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,993
           ( gasps )

6
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,630
 Falling behind there, sweetie?

7
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,498
       Worried about me,
       are you, Bridget?

8
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,933
          ( chuckles )

9
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,569
      No way, just leaves
       more tips for me.

10
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,604
           Order up!

11
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,474
            Sophie!

12
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,644
         I was coming!

13
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,182
 All right, guys. Here you go.

14
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,654
         Amber, relax.
      It's her first week.

15
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,489
       She's doing fine.

16
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,191
            - Yeah.
       - Stop stressing.

17
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,160
    - Sorry about the wait.
             - Mmm.

18
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,196
   Oh! Watch the merchandise,
            fellas.

19
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,830
         I'm saving it
     for my wedding night.

20
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,432
           That's OK.
     I don't wanna buy it.

21
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,734
     I just wanna lease it
   for tonight. ( chuckles )

22
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,237
 Sorry, but you and I both know
      you can't afford it.

23
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,772
              Oh!

24
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,607
  So, you're new here or what?

25
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,876
    I'm Sophie. I just moved
to the city a couple months ago.

26
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,277
  I'm staying with my sister.

27
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,946
      OK. You should come
         stay with me.

28
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,047
          ( chuckles )

29
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,348
      Yeah, come on, baby.

30
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,217
 Bridget, can you cover for me?

31
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,222
   Is there a problem, here?

32
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,257
    Nothing I can't handle!

33
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,593
  OK. Well, you've had enough,
   so I'm gonna cut you off.

34
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,595
       Amber, it's fine,
  they're just joking around.

35
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,964
    No! He knows the rules!
        It's hands off!

36
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,265
             - Aw!
            - Amber!

37
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,638
          ( shouting )

38
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,443
       Come on, big boy.

39
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,111
            Oh! OK.

40
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,654
          ( choking )

41
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,559
     Bridget! Do something!

42
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,795
       Set up some shots.

43
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,397
       All right, boys!
     That's enough of that!

44
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,400
    The action's over here.
          Bring it in.

45
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,936
   We're gonna have some free
drinks on the house, right now.

46
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,138
          ( cheering )

47
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,345
 That's right! That's what I'm
      talking about! Yeah!

48
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,784
             Shots?

49
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,386
    ( thumping on counter )

50
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,323
 Woman: Shots, shots, shots...!

51
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,127
          Woman: Yeah!

52
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,495
     ( cheering continues )

53
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,208
              Oh!

54
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,811
           Hi, babe!

55
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,046
      It's quiet in here.

56
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,916
     Amber started a fight.

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,152
    Amber started a fight...

58
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,286
        and I missed it.

59
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,089
      Did anybody film it?

60
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,257
             Yeah.

61
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,491
             Sweet!

62
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,529
           Oh, nice!

63
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,230
             Babe!
         ( chuckling )

64
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:34,866
           Hey, Soph!

65
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,504
              OK.

66
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,340
    What happened this time?

67
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,708
        Ask the warden.

68
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:45,877
          This warden?

69
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,347
      I messed up tonight.

70
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,848
        Hmm, I'm sorry!

71
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,550
       I had it covered.

72
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,353
You know, I'm not a kid anymore.

73
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,356
      Both: Yes, you are.

74
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,226
   If I wanted my every move
   watched, I would've stayed
  back home with mom and dad.

75
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,465
              Hmm!
         So, what's up?

76
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,167
Well, I am happy to announce...

77
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,869
     that the legendary...

78
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,739
    Jenner Branton's streak
of bad luck is officially kaput.

79
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,508
            I got us
  a super sweet online deal...

80
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,345
    for a romantic, weekend,
            getaway.

81
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,813
           - Really!
          - Uh-huh...

82
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,749
           Where to?

83
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,650
 There's some new vacation spot
 on some island off the coast.

84
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,686
- Red Plum Island. Heard of it?
             - No.

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,856
      It's supposed to be
    beautiful there, though.
         Clear skies...

86
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,890
        clear waters...

87
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,093
     there's a campsite...

88
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,328
          a marina...

89
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,596
 you and me, under the stars...

90
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,298
 snuggling by the fire, mmm...

91
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,234
           - Me like!
           - Uh-huh.

92
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,703
    - But what's the catch?
          - No catch.

93
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,939
      I... I just thought

94
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,776
      that we could bring
         Sophie along.

95
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,944
         Jenner: Look.

96
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,547
  I know that things have been
        really tense...

97
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,416
 since she moved in with you...

98
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,418
         and I just...

99
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,186
I don't know, I just thought...

100
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,687
  you know? It'd be a good...

101
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,890
   a good opportunity to have
          some fun...

102
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,124
         for a change.

103
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,095
           Thank you.

104
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,998
   Plus it was a lot cheaper
      when I signed us up
       for a group rate.

105
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,267
         Ah! OK, yeah.

106
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,069
             Soph!

107
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,971
        What do you say?
        The three of us?

108
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,373
       Great outdoors...

109
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,909
     Sure, sounds like fun.

110
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,547
     And I don't work again
     till Monday. ( slaps )

111
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,048
            Perfect!

112
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,150
  Well, looks like you've got
        yourself a date.

113
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,985
           Two dates.

114
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,087
          Actually...

115
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,089
        we need four...

116
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,624
      to get the discount.

117
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,432
             What?

118
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,249
          ( sighing )

119
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,219
  - How is it looking, Roger?
         - ( chuckles )

120
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:11,823
  Ah, well, it looks like it
  took a few stray rounds from
  last night's little episode.

121
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,460
      It's totally busted.

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,497
       - Can you fix it?
           -( sighs )

123
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,833
      Yeah, I can fix it.
    There's a lot of delicate
           equipment.

124
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,369
  I'm gonna swap parts out for
    though, but I should get
        it back online.

125
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,304
It's gonna take a while, though.

126
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,339
           ( sighs )

127
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,674
       Just get it done.

128
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,143
           It may be
    the only shot we've got
   at finding the damn thing.

129
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,879
        Or solar sonar?

130
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,053
              No.

131
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,488
    Where the hell is Cage?

132
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,223
          Here, ma'am.

133
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,659
 Did you find the test subject?

134
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,394
My men have been out all night,
      combing the waters.

135
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,696
     So far, we've come up
         with nothing.

136
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,198
   I'm pretty sure it's dead,
             ma'am.

137
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,667
       I don't wanna hear
       about pretty sure.

138
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,370
     I need the thing dead!

139
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,806
Do you understand the magnitude
  of what it is we're dealing
           with here?

140
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,309
When Congress gets wind of this!

141
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,781
We need to minimize the damage.

142
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,652
     With all due respect,
  Dr. Palmer, I was brought on
     as Chief of Security.

143
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,555
      I wasn't aware that
   I was going to be chasing
           monsters.

144
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,994
  You're here, Sergeant Cage,
       because I was told
       you were the best.

145
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,496
    Are you or are you not?

146
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,697
          Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,234
        Find the shark.

148
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,469
Before something worse happens.

149
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,641
 Hello! This is Jenner Branton.

150
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,978
   Yeah, I was just checking
     about our reservations
    for this weekend. Just--

151
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,114
             Great!

152
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,950
      You're a lifesaver.

153
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,752
    Jenner: I couldn't find
     reservations anywhere!

154
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,621
 <i> It's James here, on The Tiger.</i>

155
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,956
    <i> This just coming in from</i>
 <i> the National Weather Service.</i>

156
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,259
 <i> Looks like we've got a severe</i>
  <i> storm advisory for tomorrow.</i>
  <i> Strom clouds are expected to</i>
            <i> move in</i>

157
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,995
And I'm happy, she'll be happy.

158
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,464
      <i> ... by mid-morning,</i>
        <i> with high winds,</i>
       <i> and heavy rain...</i>

159
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,667
<i>hitting the Coast before moving</i>
   <i> west along the Gulf Coast,</i>
         <i> later tonight.</i>

160
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,335
    <i> That is, if the current</i>
     <i> weather pattern holds.</i>

161
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,137
      <i> Everyone is advised</i>
        <i> to stay inside.</i>

162
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,208
       I'm just finishing
loading up the boat right now...

163
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,543
     so, we'll see you guys
          pretty soon.

164
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,213
<i>...while we wait out the storm.</i>

165
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,049
           All right.
   Well, we'll see you then.

166
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,218
 All right. Thanks again. Bye.

167
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,887
           ( sighs )

168
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,526
        ( phone rings )

169
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,899
       ( birds chirping )

170
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,970
       Hey, Mrs. Steele!
        What's going on?

171
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,072
  What's this Sophie tells me
 about you taking our girls...

172
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,307
    to some deserted island
        for the weekend?

173
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,009
 Ah... It's Red Plum Island...

174
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,712
     and it's not deserted,
     there's people there.

175
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,981
  Mmm, sound suspicious to me!

176
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,016
Tell him I know where he lives.

177
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,353
   Ross has issued the first
     of many death threats.

178
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,457
  Don't worry. Your girls are
 in good hands. Scout's honor.

179
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,060
   We missed you and Amber...

180
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,529
    at Memo's birthday party
           last week.

181
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,764
      Yeah, I know. Um...

182
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,366
   You know, we tried, um...

183
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,768
    but Amber had to fill in
     for a friend at work--

184
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,705
     You don't have to make
        excuses for her.

185
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,040
      I'm working on her.
        Don't you worry.

186
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,810
       - I know you are.
   - I gotta go to the shop.

187
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,645
    - I'll be back in a bit.
             - Bye.

188
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,582
   You take care of my girls.

189
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,884
   Mrs. Steele: The next time
      you decide to whisk
      my only daughters...

190
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,820
 off to some deserted island--

191
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,688
       It's not deserted.

192
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,191
        Just... give me
     a little more warning.

193
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,026
     OK. Well, how about...

194
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,195
  we just call you when we get
  settled into the cabin, OK?

195
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,931
              OK.

196
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,766
         - Be careful!
 - All right, bye, Mrs. Steele.

197
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,590
      This is nice, babe.

198
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,461
 - I get boyfriend points, huh?
         - Definitely.

199
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,496
           All right!

200
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,598
       ( Amber chuckles )

201
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,700
    Hey, what is that place?

202
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,369
             Um...

203
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,470
            Creepy?

204
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,805
        Looks abandoned.

205
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,465
Hey, is that where we're going?

206
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,437
        Yeah, they said
    we each get to pick out
        one to stay in.

207
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,540
      I'm joking, Bridget.
      That's not camping.

208
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,441
     That's the north side
         of the island.

209
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,610
That's where all the rich people
   build their summer homes.

210
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,345
       See, now that it's
        getting colder,

211
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,448
most of them have already headed
     back to the mainland.

212
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,683
          See up here?

213
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,860
          We're headed
       to the south side.

214
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,322
     Wow! Very nice, babe!

215
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,626
         I'm impressed!

216
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,127
  What did I tell you, right?

217
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,331
          Mmm, I guess
  the bad luck streak is over.

218
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,066
             Mmm...

219
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,903
       ( Amber chuckles )

220
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,137
       Jenner: Let's go!

221
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,809
              Uh!

222
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,921
         What is this?

223
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,523
       Thought y'all said
  we were staying at a resort.

224
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,225
       Did I say resort?

225
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,394
         I am... um...
  I don't think I said resort.

226
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,363
      What did you expect?

227
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,565
      Um... How about...?

228
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,534
  full body massages, spas...

229
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,372
      little cabana boys,
 running around, waiting on me
         hand and foot.

230
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,775
      I can't afford that
         on my salary.

231
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,111
Well, I think it looks awesome.

232
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,447
  We can do a little fishing,
    walk along the beach...

233
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,582
       It'll be perfect.

234
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,816
             Good.

235
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,100
          How are you?

236
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,102
    Hi! I'm Jenner Branton.

237
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,137
  You must be... Santa Claus.

238
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,910
         Jenner: Psst!
             Hello?

239
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,279
    There's your cabana boy,
            Bridget.

240
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,483
Jenner: Um, a party... of four.

241
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,855
   Sophie: Reminds me of dad,
   I think he'd like it here.

242
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,625
      Hey, you are the one
   with all the good memories
        of mom and dad.

243
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,162
 There's still time, you know?
    They just don't know you
            anymore.

244
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,531
      Reality check, Soph.
      They never knew me.

245
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,367
    Besides, they have you.

246
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,869
 You are a much better daughter
        than I ever was.

247
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,572
   ( Jenner whistles ) Hello?

248
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,309
       Hello? Okie-dokie,
      I think he's broken.
         Are you there?

249
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,412
          - Anything?
    - Um, we're checking in.

250
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,750
 I don't know if they told you
 guys that we have four people
 coming in for Jenner Branton.

251
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,184
           Oh, crap!

252
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,353
 Don't, don't; get out of here!

253
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,956
   How many times have I told
     you to stay away from
      behind the counter.

254
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,492
    And if it happens again,
    I'm calling the sheriff.

255
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,760
          ( laughing )

256
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,161
       Sorry about that!

257
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,663
         Homeless man,
     always coming in here.

258
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,066
  Hey, look, I wanna apologize
  for keeping you all waiting.

259
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,801
    I had breakfast burritos
         this morning.

260
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,637
    And I'll tell one thing,
   they gave me the squirts.

261
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,005
           ( laughs )

262
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,674
            Anyway!
  What can I do for you kids?

263
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,877
    Um, I'm Jenner Branton.

264
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,913
  Oh! Mr. Branton! Of course.

265
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,215
             Um...
    ( clearing his throat )

266
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,585
   Welcome to Red Plum Island
     where all your dreams
     come true. ( solemn )

267
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,221
 My name is Lester and I'm here
 to attend to your every need.

268
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,926
 ( chuckles ) If you could just
   get your signature, here.
      I'll get your keys.

269
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,994
       Thank you so much.

270
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,395
      We saw your cabins.

271
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,531
 Well, there'll be more cabins
             soon.

272
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,367
   Still working on expanding
    the guest accommodation.

273
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,035
        What did you say
         your name was?

274
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,870
           - Lester.
  - Lester, nice to meet you.

275
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,407
Hey, so...  like, what is there
       to do around here?

276
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,943
        Oh, well, um...
      We have swimming...

277
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:03,014
 boating, fishing, parasailing,
     but only on Saturdays.

278
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,083
 There are trails that go deep
       into the woods...

279
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,584
  that are perfect for hiking.

280
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,586
          And we have
  a brand new Redbox kiosk...

281
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,055
        outside of here,
 if you want to watch a movie.

282
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,724
     And it's the only one
         on the island.

283
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,159
   I'm pretty proud of that.

284
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,195
         And of course,
    after the sun goes down,

285
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,864
   I do a little dinner show
     over in our rec room.

286
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,700
Well, I grill, make cocktails...

287
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,303
      I tell you, it gets
    pretty wild up in there.

288
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,472
 Cocktails? Do you have a bar?

289
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,575
       Do we have a bar?

290
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,609
          ( laughing )

291
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,245
            The bar!

292
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,915
         Jenner: Cool!

293
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,321
  Um... Where's the bartender?

294
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,060
        At your service!

295
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,596
          ( laughing )

296
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,500
    This is perfect, Lester.
           Thank you.

297
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,237
    OK. Well, I'm gonna head
         to the beach.

298
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,811
   It's a little cold outside
         to be tanning.

299
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,147
       If the sun's out,
            I'm out!

300
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,816
     This body wasn't meant
     for covering, anyway.

301
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,951
   She does have two points.

302
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,122
 So... I'll see you guys later.

303
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,790
     Sophie: Hey, Lester...

304
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,058
    What's that little boat
  at the pier down the beach?

305
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,894
   We saw it when we came in.

306
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,595
    Oh! You must be talking
        about the base.

307
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,797
    You know, it's not sure
   what went on over there...

308
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,467
but rumor has it they were doing
       lots of testing...

309
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,302
 developing chemical warfare...

310
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,804
    new kind of mustard gas
  or something, I don't know.

311
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,040
  They closed down in the 70s.

312
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,676
           You know,
    there are old stories...

313
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,212
   about how the south would
   fight off the sharks that
 the current would bring down.

314
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,848
        Wait... Sharks?

315
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:48,286
          Well, sure!
  In some of those old stories
we were nicknamed Shark Island.

316
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,122
    Wow! That doesn't sound
        ominous, at all.

317
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,458
 Look, I've lived here my whole
   life, and I've never seen
            a shark.

318
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,029
 So trust me, you have nothing
        to worry about.

319
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,758
              Man:
        Check that out.

320
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,160
       Should we go over?

321
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,730
       What do you think?

322
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,432
             Man 2:
     We should call Danny.

323
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,802
Guys, seriously? Take a picture,
        it lasts longer.

324
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,241
   Man 1: That's what I think
         it is, right?

325
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,142
It must've washed up last night.

326
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,285
             Whoa!

327
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,854
   People used to talk about
      how this marina was
        the place to be.

328
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,023
But they closed down the base...

329
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,959
         and eventually
      built another marina
   over on the north island.

330
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,197
  So all of the wealthy people
build their luxurious homes over
           there now.

331
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,632
          We saw that.

332
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,400
        But I have hopes
   of growing this resort...

333
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,736
  and putting the south island
        back on the map.

334
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,837
          ( chuckles )

335
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,839
           Hey, guys!

336
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,474
  You've got to come see this!

337
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,950
       Do you believe it!

338
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,618
   Bridget: Isn't it awesome?

339
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,023
          Jenner: Wow!
      This is so awesome!

340
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,491
  Sophie: It's a little gross.

341
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,660
 I wonder what happened to it.

342
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,361
 Amber: Jenner, don't touch it!

343
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,230
    I'm just looking at it.

344
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,267
   Jenner: Look at this hole!

345
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,873
       Jenner: Looks like
 it's been bitten by something.

346
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,474
           Like what?

347
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,143
    Probably another shark.

348
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,678
          Jenner: No!

349
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,414
   I don't think sharks bite
         other sharks.

350
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,481
            Do they?

351
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,083
       I don't think so.

352
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,319
     But I know one thing,
  this is going on Instagram.

353
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,157
   Bridget, could you just...
             don't?

354
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,925
             Baby.

355
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,460
         Take it easy.

356
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,395
           It's dead.
    It's not gonna bite her.

357
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,031
             No...

358
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,866
           This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

359
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,001
     We should document it.

360
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,402
              No.

361
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,338
         She is right.
      That's a good idea.

362
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,040
    I'm gonna take a picture
     for Lester's website.

363
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,709
      Maybe that'll bring
       some customers in.

364
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,743
           ( laughs )

365
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,723
            Get away
          from there!

366
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,891
          My bad, man.
   Sorry about that, sheriff.

367
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,860
      We were just...ah...
      taking some pictures

368
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,096
     for Lester's website.
    We didn't mean anything.

369
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,399
         ( screaming )

370
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,218
          Amber! Run!

371
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,502
        Mayday! Mayday!

372
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,038
              Ah!

373
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,040
    Please, please, please!
      Get me out of here!

374
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,842
        We've got to go!

375
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,216
           ( crying )

376
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,684
       Bridget, untie us!

377
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,555
          Keys! Keys!
      Where are the keys!?

378
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,925
          Oh, my God.

379
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,229
 Jenner had them in his pocket.

380
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,864
      What does that mean?

381
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,535
       It means this boat
     isn't going anywhere.

382
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,836
              No.

383
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,337
              No!

384
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,740
   Someone call the sheriff.

385
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,841
          No, no, no!

386
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,876
        No, don't come!
              No!

387
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,111
              No!

388
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,198
    The storm's starting up
           out there.

389
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,400
    It's all over the news.

390
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,237
      Straight-line winds.
             Rain.

391
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,372
    They're telling everyone
        to stay inside.

392
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,741
     Yeah. They'd be right.

393
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,611
    I had no idea there'd be
     a storm this weekend.

394
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,915
 You think the girls are okay?

395
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,851
        They'll be fine.

396
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,922
  Jenner still hasn't called.

397
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,058
       Shouldn't they be
     on the island by now?

398
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,426
   Will you leave them alone?

399
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,428
You can't shelter them forever,
            Davina.

400
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,734
     <i> You've reached Jenner.</i>
     <i> I am a little tied up</i>
         <i> at the moment.</i>

401
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,471
  <i> But if you leave a message,</i>
      <i> I will call you back</i>
       <i> as soon as I can.</i>

402
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,572
        <i> Thank you much.</i>

403
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,376
           No answer.

404
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,411
Sophie is not answering either.

405
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,880
           Or Amber.

406
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,649
        That's typical.

407
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,818
   What if something happened
          to the boat?

408
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,423
      Are you listening?!
     They're not answering
         their phones!

409
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,127
      Well, maybe they are
  on the boat, and they can't
    hear you over the motor.

410
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,429
   Maybe there's no reception
        where they are.

411
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,465
   Sky's not always falling,
            Davina.

412
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,967
        I knew something
   like this would happened.

413
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,669
         Enough, okay?

414
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,374
  We raised two strong girls.

415
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,742
        They'll be fine.

416
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,121
      That shark was dead.

417
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,489
     We all saw it, right?

418
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,857
     It couldn't have been.

419
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,694
   It doesn't make any sense.

420
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,063
We need to call the coastguard,
         or something.

421
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,035
             Hey...

422
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,772
    I'm sorry about Jenner.

423
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,363
 Amber: Bridget, call for help!

424
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,530
       Bridget: Call who?

425
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,633
 I've one bar and no Internet.

426
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,936
             Ouch!

427
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,740
   Amber: We're drifting away
         from the dock!

428
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,412
        What do we do?!

429
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,547
          We gotta get
         off the boat!

430
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,384
          Wait, wait!
          Stop, stop!

431
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,618
         We're trapped!

432
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,422
            Guys...

433
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,391
    The motor is destroyed.

434
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,792
    Bridget: We're screwed!

435
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,694
 Sophie: Amber, what do we do?

436
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,965
           The radio.

437
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,370
          ( screams )

438
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,605
        Hello?! Hello?!

439
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,674
       Is anybody there?

440
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,410
 Mayday! Mayday! We need help!
    We're in Red Plum Island

441
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,779
     Amber:<i> Mayday! Mayday!</i>

442
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,380
      <i> Can anyone hear me?!</i>

443
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,716
  This is a restricted access
       military channel.

444
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,952
- You need to contact the local
   authorities on the island.
        - They're dead!

445
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,923
   There's a shark washed up
    on shore and it's eating
   people and it's after us.

446
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,459
        <i> Can you hear me?</i>

447
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,697
             Hello?

448
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,733
    It's him, Sergeant Cage.

449
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,269
      Copy that. Hang on.
    We're coming to get you.

450
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,804
    Hello? Can you hear me?

451
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,540
            Come in.

452
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,975
            Come in.

453
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,914
       Damn it, damn it.
   I think the radio is dead.

454
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,250
  Come on! We need to go now!
            Come on!

455
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,687
   Sophie: He's still there.
How are we going to get through?

456
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,456
Okay, I'll create a distraction
       and you guys run.

457
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,157
              No!

458
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,860
 Don't argue with me right now!
         Just be ready.

459
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,029
           Hey! Hey!

460
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,666
           Over here!

461
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,503
       - Go! Go! Come on!
             - No!

462
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,341
            Come on!

463
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,642
        Amber, come on!

464
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,418
        Oh, yeah. Okay.

465
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,653
            Cheers!

466
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,158
        We were there...
             okay?

467
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,128
      And... we're flying
        at 10,000 feet.

468
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,131
      And what did she do?

469
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,234
       - Totally freeze.
       - Totally freeze.

470
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,773
 The pilot had to take us down.

471
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,476
       But to my defense,
     we got a full refund.

472
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,878
  Besides, I said I was sorry.

473
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,547
           It's okay.

474
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,715
        Except the fact
      that you're boring.

475
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,517
            - What?
      - I love you anyway.

476
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,653
     What? I can be crazy!

477
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:26,757
  I defy you to name one crazy
  thing that you've ever done.

478
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,727
   How about skinny-dipping?

479
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:39,369
    That water is ice cold.
        No way you would
       ever get in there.

480
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,637
             Yeah?

481
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,054
          ( laughing )

482
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,891
            No way.

483
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,028
          ( laughing )

484
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,033
      I take it all back!
      You're a crazy girl!

485
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,891
             Steph?

486
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,261
  Stephanie! Stephanie! Steph!

487
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,662
             Steph!

488
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,036
         ( screaming )

489
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,376
      Whoa! What happened?

490
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,178
   I heard screaming down on
     the beach and I tried
     calling the sheriff--

491
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,413
           He's dead.

492
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,583
  Amber, it's fine. I'm okay.

493
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,218
         What happened?

494
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,420
   There was a shark attack.

495
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,955
      Where's Mr. Branton?

496
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,458
         He's gone too.

497
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,094
             Crap.

498
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,297
    I dropped my cell phone,
       somebody call 911.

499
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,733
We don't have 911 on the island.
The most we have is the sheriff,

500
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,936
  and volunteer fire and EMTs.

501
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,271
   If you want anything else,
       you've got to wait
       for the mainland.

502
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,973
But I don't think they're gonna
come out with this storm coming.

503
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,075
        There's a storm?

504
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,412
        Yeah, a big one.
    It's been on TV all day.
        You didn't hear?

505
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,448
    No. I talked to someone
       from the military
     over the boat's radio.

506
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,684
 I feel like they are the only
     ones who can help us
         at this point.

507
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:37,621
   We need to try to get back
    in contact with them. Do
     you have a a CB or...?

508
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,556
    - Maybe one in the back.
         - Okay, okay.

509
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,192
  What good is that gonna do?
You said there's no one to call!

510
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,927
     It's just worth a try.
  Can you please go help him.

511
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,363
           - Why me?
           - Bridget.

512
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,500
     What is your problem?

513
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,135
        I can take care
      of myself, you know?

514
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,804
 Yeah, so you keep telling me.

515
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,473
  On the dock, you should have
      left me. I was fine.

516
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,508
   But instead, you came back
 and it could have gotten you.

517
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,509
         But it didn't.

518
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,844
        But it could've!

519
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,647
    We already lost Jenner,
          we can't...

520
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,082
       I can't lose you.

521
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,319
    It's better me than you.

522
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:13,657
Eventually, you're going to have
   to stop living in the past
     and forgive yourself.

523
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,660
      Look what we found.

524
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,062
       Oh, my God. Great.

525
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,566
          - Try that.
            - Okay.

526
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,741
         Hello? Hello?
      Can anyone hear me?

527
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,113
There's a shark on the shoreline
    and it's killing people.

528
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,249
          Who is this?

529
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,819
   Are you with the military?

530
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,721
  My name is Dr. Diane Palmer.

531
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,223
       What is your name?

532
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,591
          Amber Steel.

533
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,826
   Where are you, Miss Steel?

534
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,562
     We are on the marina.

535
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,699
    Where is the shark now,
          Miss Steel?

536
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,567
      I don't know, it...

537
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,737
      It attacked our boat
     and then it swam away.

538
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,839
    Listen to me carefully.

539
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,341
       Is the shark dead?

540
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,842
        Did you kill it?

541
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,678
        Are you kidding?
     No, we didn't kill it.

542
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:13,283
      It ate my boyfriend,
   and it killed the sheriff.
        Its face was...

543
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,787
It looked like it had been dead
      for days, but it was
         still moving.

544
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:21,124
     Sit tight, Miss Steel.
   I'm sending a professional
  to deal with the situation.

545
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,361
  Everything is gonna be okay.

546
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,929
        - Over and out.
      - Amber:<i> No, no, no!</i>

547
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,399
         Hello? Hello?
     Wait? Oh, my... Hello?

548
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,867
  So, we just wait here then,
             right?

549
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,136
  She said help is on the way.

550
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,705
   I mean, it's not like the
  shark's gonna come on land.

551
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,874
       We just stay away
        from the water,
       and we'll be fine.

552
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,110
       No, I don't know.

553
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:43,747
  You saw that shark that got
   Jenner, it seemed to move
       just fine on land.

554
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,850
If that thing is actually dead,

555
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,052
then maybe it doesn't even need
          to breathe.

556
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,222
 I mean, it could kill just as
  easily on land as in water.

557
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,392
  Amber, it couldn't have been
   dead. It just must've been
     stunned or something.

558
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,695
  No, the hole in the side...
      and that big... No!

559
00:34:58,729 --> 00:34:59,763
          It was dead!

560
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,565
   And it just keeps killing!

561
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,302
 Okay. So like a zombie shark?

562
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,603
             What?

563
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,271
        ( man screams )

564
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,778
     What are those people
      doing in the water?

565
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,681
        ( man screams )

566
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,649
         ( screaming )

567
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,856
     Get away! Go, go, go!

568
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,126
        Woman: Help me!

569
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,629
       You have any guns
          in the back?

570
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,697
     Yes, I have shot guns
      for skeet shooting!

571
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,165
        - Get them now.
            - Okay.

572
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,601
      Okay, I'm gonna go,
       and you stay here.

573
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,203
   - No, I'm going with you.
     - You don't even know
      how to shoot a gun.

574
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,407
 Please, you think you are the
  only one that dad taught how
         to use a gun?

575
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,742
Locked and loaded, ready to go!

576
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,910
             Okay.

577
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,513
 All right. Bridget, let's go.

578
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,949
     No way. I'm not dying
       for those people.

579
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,751
       Damn it, Bridget.

580
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,287
 Can you think of someone other
  than yourself for just once?

581
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,922
        Okay, y'all go.
   I'll stay here with the CB

582
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,324
         and try to get
 in touch with the coast guard.

583
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,559
             Okay?

584
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,697
           Hey! Hey!

585
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,369
             Move!

586
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:16,540
     - Help, help! Help us!
       - Stop, get away!

587
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,008
             Help!

588
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,681
     - These bullets aren't
        doing anything.
         - Get it away!

589
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,386
          ( gasping )

590
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,623
         What is that?

591
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,295
          ( grunting )

592
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,931
    Get inside! Get inside!

593
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,475
         Amber! Amber!

594
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,743
             Amber!

595
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,386
  Hurry, come on, it's coming!

596
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,392
        Amber, come on,
     get out of the water!

597
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,031
        ( Amber moans )

598
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,778
s more than one now.

599
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,013
           Thank you.

600
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,114
          Who are you?

601
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,515
     Sergeant Maxwell Cage.

602
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,484
           I'm Amber,
   this is my sister Sophie.

603
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,219
           It was you
      on the radio, right?

604
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,621
           We need to
     get you inside, okay?

605
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,156
      No. Inside? We need
    to get off this island.

606
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,993
    We're from the mainland.
      We need to get back,
       it took our boat.

607
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,962
I understand that, but right now
       we have to contain
         the situation.

608
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,497
     What is the situation?

609
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:48,898
       That's classified
        for now, ma'am.

610
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,767
          Classified?

611
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,136
 Those things ate my boyfriend!

612
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,171
  It was dead, and it just...

613
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,707
             Wait.

614
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,676
     Are you from the base?

615
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,779
    Lester said it was shut
    down, but is still open?

616
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,882
 It would have to be. How else
   did you get here so fast?

617
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,884
        What's going on?

618
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,453
   I heard there was chemical
    warfare testing? Is that
         what this is?

619
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,789
      Did you do something
        to those sharks?

620
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,891
    Look, I'm not at liberty
   to discuss anything until
    we know what's going on.

621
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,126
We need to get you inside, okay?

622
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,261
  No, that's not good enough!

623
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,865
  Bravo team, this is Alpha 1.

624
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,366
    What's you status, over?

625
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,870
         - What is it?
     - Repeat, Bravo team.

626
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,204
    Give me a sit rep, over.

627
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,873
        What's going on?

628
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,274
      It's another attack.
          It's my men.

629
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,510
   I need to get you inside.

630
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,446
  All right? You need to stay
  somewhere safe until someone
       comes to get you.

631
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,847
 Take us with you. We can help.

632
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,317
    No, you need to be safe.
        Just stay there.

633
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,953
No, I don't know if you realize,
   Sergeant Cage, but nowhere
     on this island is safe

634
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,488
as long as they have us trapped.

635
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,190
 Unless you have more rockets.

636
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,359
    No, I only expected one
         of the sharks.

637
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,996
     Then you're gonna need
      our help if you want
      to rescue your men.

638
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,900
    My vehicle's this way...

639
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,336
   Wait, what about Bridget?

640
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,938
    We can count on Bridget
    to take care of herself.

641
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,541
   That's what she's best at.

642
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,744
        Mayday! Mayday!
    This is Red Plum Island,
       do you read? Over.

643
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,616
        Mayday! Mayday!
     This is an emergency!
       Do you read? Over.

644
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,756
       Amber: Stay here!
 We'll be right back with help!

645
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,893
      What just happened?

646
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,995
    Did that dude just have
       a rocket launcher?

647
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,502
            Oh, no.

648
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,874
          Bravo team,
 this is Alpha 1 come in. Over.

649
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,443
          Bravo team.

650
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,050
          Bravo team.

651
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,852
 This is Alpha 1 come in. Over.

652
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,454
          Sergeant...

653
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,825
    They spent every shell.

654
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,226
  Still didn't stand a chance.

655
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,466
            Damn it.

656
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,834
       They are all dead?

657
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,389
     How is that possible?

658
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,863
     What happened to them?

659
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,099
          Over there.

660
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,242
 Is the blood drawing them in?

661
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,444
What's wrong with them, though?
      They're going nuts.

662
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,418
             Bruce.

663
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,254
          Diane:<i> Cage,</i>
     <i> what's the situation?</i>

664
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,556
 Cage:<i> The whole team is gone,</i>
             <i> ma'am.</i>

665
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,860
         And the shark?

666
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,062
        <i> He's still here,</i>
 <i> but we've got worse problems.</i>

667
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,397
   Subject Bruce has friends.

668
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,032
          More sharks?

669
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,434
          Affirmative.

670
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,135
         And they seem
      to be infected, too.

671
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,671
          Oh, my God.

672
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,242
              How?

673
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,745
     <i> As far as I can tell,</i>
    <i> the infected sharks are</i>
     <i> killing the islanders.</i>

674
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,581
 The other sharks are swimming
in, they're eating what's left.

675
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,984
       It's like they're
        being poisoned.

676
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,454
       They die when they
     ingest the body parts

677
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,256
    and then they come back.

678
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,158
And Bruce is just watching them.

679
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,827
  If I didn't know any better,

680
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,629
 <i> I would think that he's trying</i>
         <i> to turn them.</i>

681
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,597
      <i> I think he is trying</i>
     <i> to make more like him.</i>

682
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,766
       If they're turning
   after eating the remains,

683
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,703
    that must mean that the
infection can spread to humans.

684
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,672
        To what extent,
         I don't know.

685
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,109
     How is that possible?

686
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,844
   <i> I don't know that either.</i>

687
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,081
            ( sobs )

688
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,056
     Ma'am. Please advise.

689
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,425
     <i> Contain the situation,</i>
   <i> Sergeant. However you can.</i>

690
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,462
        In the meantime,
     I've gotta figure out
   how to reverse this mess.

691
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,099
      Acknowledged. Over.

692
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,208
           ( sighs )

693
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,577
        What'd she say?

694
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,062
   They totally left me here.

695
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,830
         What the hell?

696
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,231
             Yeah.

697
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,133
    That army guy don't need
          their help.

698
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,302
     This is so like Amber.

699
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,870
     So like both of them.

700
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,539
          They are all
        goody two-shoes.

701
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,375
         And wanna save
      and help everybody.

702
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,510
    Actually, I think that's
    a noble characteristic.

703
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,614
           - Shut up.
             - OK.

704
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,882
          So sue me if
       I don't wanna die.

705
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,318
           Does that
     make me a bad person?

706
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:48,558
        I mean, it's all
      meaningless anyway.

707
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,227
           This world
       is going to crap.

708
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:55,898
            We're all
      just directionless.

709
00:43:55,933 --> 00:44:00,937
         Hiding behind
 social media from each other.

710
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,939
  Simply just to be reassured

711
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,042
 that this all means anything.

712
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,378
      That we even exist.

713
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,614
     Or anybody even cares.

714
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,385
       Bridget, I didn't
    know you felt that way.

715
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,588
             Yeah,
  guess I feel a lot of ways.

716
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,591
        Just nobody can
    ever see past my boobs.

717
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,060
 Long enough to listen I guess.

718
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,665
        Well, I listen.

719
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,069
  You are a good guy, Lester.

720
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,572
      Thank you, my mother
        always said so.

721
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,141
    I'm still not having sex
       with you, though.

722
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:44,580
        Yeah, thank you.
  I'm painfully aware of that.

723
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,726
    Why do those people keep
      coming to the water?

724
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,228
       They're setting up
     a zombie shark buffet.

725
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,098
  Should, should we warn them?

726
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,652
  - Bridget: Get out of there!
    - Lester: Get away from
           the water.

727
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,456
        - Get away from
           the water.
      - Get out! come on!

728
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,805

00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,506
        We tried calling
         Jenner and --

750
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,809
  <i> Sophie: Jenner is dead, mom.</i>

751
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,213
             Hello?

752
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,616
 Hello, this is Red Plum Island
trying to reach the coastguard.

753
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,151
        Is anyone there?

754
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,226
     Mom, can you hear me?

755
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,663
 No, no, we're OK. I'm OK, Mom.

756
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,097
        Where is Amber?

757
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,099
 I wanna talk to her right now.

758
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:21,170
   <i> Sophie: Ugh, mom, this is</i>
     <i> not the time to argue.</i>

759
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,273
        <i> Look, Jenner had</i>
     <i> the keys to the boat.</i>

760
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,509
 <i> We're stuck here until we can</i>
     <i> radio the coastguard.</i>

761
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:30,346
    I'm not waiting on them.
  I'm coming to get you, baby.

762
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,281
        <i> Sophie: Dad, no,</i>
     <i> don't, by the time you</i>

763
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,050
    <i> get here help will have</i>
        <i> already arrived.</i>

764
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,286
     <i> You'll just be putting</i>
    <i> yourself in danger too.</i>

765
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,957
      -<i> We'll be OK until</i>
  <i> the coastguard gets here.  </i>
    - Hey, Bill. It's Ross.

766
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,559
  Sophie, listen, stay inside.

767
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,596
      Dad will find a way
      to come and get you.
      Stay where you are.

768
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,931
      <i> Sophie: Mom, don't!</i>

769
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:52,768
      I don't give a damn
 how bad the storms are, Bill.
    My girls are out there!

770
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,472
   <i> Sophie: Mom, really, we're</i>
    <i> fine, tell dad to stop.</i>

771
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,508
  <i> Don't worry about us. Amber</i>
   <i> is taking good care of me.</i>

772
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,244
    The storm is too heavy.

773
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:04,847
    Ain't nobody getting out
  there until it lightens up.

774
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,917
     Amber had no business
    dragging you off there.

775
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,987
         With the storm
  and everything and now this?

776
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,289
        No, no, no, no,
      it's not like that.

777
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,660
      Oh, my parents must
   be worried sick right now.

778
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,396
           It took me
      forever to convince

779
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,366
        them to let her
       move to the city.

780
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,302
     And I promised I would
   take care of her for them.

781
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,906
      They're not worried
         about you too?

782
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,274
              No.

783
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,158
  This is my daughter, Marie.

784
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,567
        She's beautiful.

785
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,838
    It's the only picture I
   have of her. She's 10 now.

786
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,675
    I had her when I was 15.

787
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,644
     Pretty wild back then.

788
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:13,582
      So I gave her up for
      adoption and haven't
        seen her since.

789
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,217
           I'm sorry.

790
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,087
  It's for the best, you know,

791
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:22,491
      and she has a great
        life, so I hear.

792
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,028
     The truth is, though,

793
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:30,099
  Marie was the absolute last
     straw with my parents.

794
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,436
         I was always
   a disappointment for them.

795
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,073
       <i> Sophie: What? no,</i>
       <i> I can't hear you.</i>

796
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,743
 Sophie though, Sophie, I mean.

797
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,545
        Straight A's all
      through high school.

798
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:46,882
   And she played basketball
 and she volunteered at church.

799
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,851
   Jenner always said that...

800
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,293
    Do you have any family?

801
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,796
       Ex-wife, two kids,
       a boy and a girl.

802
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,533
I get to see them a lot more now
 that I'm a private contractor.

803
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,503
    It takes a special kind

804
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,139
       to raise a family
        in the service.

805
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,641
  And I was not that special.

806
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,410
      Barely got through.

807
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,648
    Sorry. What did mom say?

808
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,487
       She blames me for
       this, doesn't she?

809
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,656
         How bad is it?

810
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,925
    Dad is trying to charter
a boat out here to come get us.

811
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,796
     But with the storm on
      the mainland no one
         would go out.

812
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,532
       I told them we're
      OK but you know dad.

813
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,201
         I can meet you
      there in 20 minutes.

814
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,141
  Oh come on, Charlie. I just
   need to borrow your boat!

815
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,044
      I'll go by myself,
   you don't even need to go.

816
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,181
       Damn it, Charlie!
  I'm talking about my girls!

817
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,252
           ( sighs )

818
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,194
      I turned off the TV,
  I couldn't take it anymore.

819
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,066
        I blamed Amber.

820
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:18,407
       What if something
       happens to Amber.

821
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,078
   And last thing she thinks

822
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,380
     is that I blamed her.

823
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,849
 It was so easy raising Sophie.

824
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,455
      She was always quiet

825
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,057
        and reflective.

826
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,259
Never got upset about anything.

827
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,665
         Oh, but Amber,
        she was defiant.

828
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:46,268
      And angry and always

829
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,572
   had to have the last word.

830
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,741
          - And she --
     - She's just like you.

831
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,914
     That's why the two of
    you can never get along.

832
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,883
   But she knows we love her.

833
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:04,019
         Oh, does she?

834
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,622
      We can tell her next
        time we see her.

835
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:10,226
        - But what if --
         - No, Davina.

836
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,061
         She's strong.

837
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,662
      She'll be all right.

838
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,265
          Have faith.

839
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,538
  I guess that's all we have.

840
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:43,125
 Hello. Hello. This is Red Plum
 Island, can you hear me? Over.

841
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,431
     Hello, we're trying to
     reach the coastguard,
     can you hear me? Over.

842
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,767
        It's the storm,
  even if you do get a signal

843
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,071
   out there, there's no way
   they're gonna send a boat.

844
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,674
    We're just gonna have to
  batten down and ride it out.

845
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,713
      Lester, are you OK?

846
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,785
What did you do to those sharks?

847
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,620
     I'm not at the liberty
       to talk about it.

848
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,123
 No matter how much I want to.

849
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,865
   You better start talking.
           Right now.

850
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,435
   Lester, put the gun down.

851
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,270
           Not until
      we get some answers.

852
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,506
   Look, do you even know how
       to use that thing?

853
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,608
        Of course I do.

854
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,678
     I'm an apex predator.

855
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:40,182
      I'm a heartbreaker!
       I'm a widow-maker!

856
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:45,321
  I just, just lost a friend.

857
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,565
 Listen, man, I'm no scientist.

858
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,635
       I was just brought
   on for personal security.

859
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,337
      I do know the base
        was closed down

860
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,172
        a long time ago
     and recently reopened.

861
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:06,508
   A Dr. Diane Palmer was put
 in charge of a special project

862
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,377
      that was contracted
       by the government.

863
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:12,047
        A special killer
     zombie shark project?

864
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,751
   No, that was an accident.

865
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:20,656
         Dr. Palmer was
    trying to develop a way
  of regenerating dead tissue.

866
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,493
      Organs, for soldiers
      in the battlefield.

867
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,729
    Sharks were used as test
  subjects because their basic

868
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,999
  internal structure is almost
   identical to human beings.

869
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,568
     They're good analogs.

870
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,871
    They picked this island
 because of the shark traffic.

871
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:39,408
    But something went wrong
 with one of our sharks Bruce.

872
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:46,649
He got out, he killed several of
the researchers and he escaped.

873
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:50,052
      Bruce, he is the one
 with the harpoon on his back?

874
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,620
        The ringleader?

875
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,925
 Palmer put a beacon out in the
water that sent out a pulse that

876
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,094
      somehow it triggered
      the electroreceptors

877
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,697
 in sharks and attracted them.

878
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,566
Cage: That's how we brought them
   in for capture and study.

879
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:09,238
     So can we use that to
    capture it? to kill it?

880
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:13,208
It was damaged in the firefight
      when Bruce escaped.

881
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,144
     We have our tech Roger
    working on in but until

882
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,747
    he gets it fixed, Bruce
       is off his leash.

883
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,450
      And apparently he's
     making more like him.

884
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,452
      Although they're not
   as smart as him it seems.

885
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,889
     -  They're more like.
           - Zombies.

886
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,359
        For a lack of a
       better word, yeah.

887
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,561
        He is a carrier
    of some kind of plague.

888
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:35,531
  Whatever he bites, it turns.

889
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:39,935
    Wait, whatever he bites?
        Like people too?

890
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,271
           ( growls )

891
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,140
 I said I've had about enough
            of you!

892
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,610
 Come on, get out of here! go!
             Shoo!

893
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,283
            - Freak.
      - Who was that guy?

894
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,552
        Some idiot that
     I need to get rid of.

895
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,421
He always wants something free.

896
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,956
      Gives me the creeps.

897
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,004
              No!

898
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,345
   Sophie: How do we kill it?

899
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,780
             Clear!

900
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,491
 What? In all the zombie movies
      do you have to ask?

901
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,860
     Palmer's regen agent,
 it's activated by the nervous

902
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,162
 system you can cut off a limb,
      but it still moves.

903
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,764
       Like the shark we
      found on the beach.

904
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,298
          Makes sense
    to take out the source.

905
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,533
       Aim for the brain.

906
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,335
          So what now?

907
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,470
  We destroy the infected and
 keep the virus from spreading.

908
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,173
    That may not be enough,
    we need to find a cure.

909
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,875
  Dr. Palmer is our only hope.

910
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,643
      We need to get back
       to her right now.

911
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,979
      But if the islanders
 are turning into zombies too,

912
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,214
   how are we gonna do that?
   We need an army to fight
          all of them.

913
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,850
        Leave it to me.
    You get to the facility,

914
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,052
     I'll rally the troops,
    we'll hold the infected
           off here.

915
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,354
           Let's go.

916
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,231
         Yeah, it's me.

917
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,001
      It's time to awaken
        the dogs of war.

918
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,938
    I mean get your weapons
 and meet me over at the shop,
             Danny.

919
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:26,375
No, I don't have any gas money!
     I just gave you money!

920
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,238
           ( sighs )

921
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,914
           Oh, damn.

922
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,654
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

923
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,657
         <i> Roger: Doctor!</i>

924
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,565
         <i> I think I got</i>
      <i> the beacon working.</i>

925
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,702
     That's the first good
     news I've had all day.

926
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,171
   With it we can lure Bruce
 and the other infected sharks

927
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,206
      back to the facility
        for containment

928
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:35,210
         and immediate
         extermination.

929
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:39,982
     And after we do that,
     we're gonna start over
         again, right?

930
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,254
         I don't know.

931
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:48,190
    I don't know if I have
 the stomach for this anymore.

932
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:52,094
 This was supposed about saving
  lives, not destroying them.

933
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,830
         I'm just more
      concerned right now

934
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,799
         with trying to
       clean up our mess.

935
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,037
            My mess.

936
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:09,011
       Diane, I need you
        to listen to me.

937
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,946
           <i> You cannot</i>
     <i> give up on this work.</i>

938
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,115
        We are virtually
     on the edge of giving

939
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,751
      the world something
       truly phenomenal.

940
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,921
      We are about to cure
 physical disabilities forever.

941
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,189
    And if you give up now,
   you're gonna be giving up

942
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,826
        on every single
     person on this Earth.

943
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:30,332
    Yes, we've had a pretty
      significant setback.

944
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,567
      But we can do this.

945
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,736
             Roger!

946
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:38,407
         ( screaming )

947
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,048
          ( gasping )

948
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,366
            Lester:
     OK, here's the score.

949
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,636
We have a bit of a zombie shark
     problem on the island.

950
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,371
            - What?
             - Huh?

951
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,307
      Yeah, zombie shark.

952
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,677
         They bite you,
    you turn into a zombie.

953
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,814
   Let this sink in a minute.

954
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:26,688
        Anyway, what we
    do here on this beach...

955
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,658
 could shape all human history.

956
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:33,328
      This island has been
     ignored for too long.

957
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,896
But we will show the world that

958
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:37,299
 we are made of stronger stuff.

959
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,668
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah!

960
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,737
    So get everything ready.

961
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,806
        Because what we
     do on this beach today

962
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,409
      will bridge the gap
     between all humanity.

963
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:51,213
        - Are you ready?
            - Yeah!

964
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,551
      OK, here they come.

965
01:00:56,586 --> 01:01:01,256
        Whatever you do,
    don't let them bite you.

966
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,961
Let them remember the time that
 they came to Red Plum Island.

967
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:10,098
           - Come on!
            - Yeah!

968
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,204
     Yeah! Let's get them!

969
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,042
          ( growling )

970
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,477
 <i> Cage: Dr. Palmer, you read me?</i>
             <i> Over.</i>

971
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,046
    Sergeant, you're alive!

972
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,415
         Yeah, for now.

973
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,086
   We got a development, all
    the shark's bite victims
   are turning into zombies.

974
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,955
   Roger's fixed the beacon,
     if we can activate it

975
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:10,158
     we can bring them all
  right back to this facility.

976
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,860
       If we can get them
       all in one place.

977
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,196
        Then we can kill
       them all at once.

978
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,566
   I've got enough C-4 to do
 the job. We're coming to you.

979
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,267
             Wait!

980
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,137
        Wait, I've been
      working on a vaccine

981
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:25,240
         for the virus,
  but in order to finalize it.

982
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:29,244
      I need to test it on
      one of the infected.

983
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:34,216
   I need an infected brain.
            Intact.

984
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,318
        Doctor, I don't
       think that that's
  a good idea you haven't seen

985
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:39,287
   what this things can do,
 they don't exactly stay still
            for you.

986
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,157
       One of them does.

987
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,641
              Oh!

988
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,980
       Come on! come on!
       I'm ready for you!

989
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:14,022
      Come on! We'll have
        a fish sandwich.

990
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:18,960
        Oh! He's strong!
  Wait, okay, I got him, yeah!

991
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,830
             Yeah!

992
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,803
          ( shouting )

993
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,671
           Hey! Hey!
     Watch out, watch out!

994
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:36,978
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
       Oh, my God he took
    his arm away! I'm sorry!

995
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,246
          ( screams )

996
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:54,830
       No, no, no, wait,
       it was right here.

997
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:57,299
       Fan out, we got to
        find this thing.

998
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,417
             Amber:
   Sophie, don't get too far!

999
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,719
         Relax, warden.

1000
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,162
       Guys, I found it!

1001
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,064
  Amber: Soph, where are you?

1002
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,568
    Sophie: I'm on the other
       side of the grass.

1003
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:10,772
          ( grunting )

1004
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,322
        Okay, get back!
           Get back!

1005
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:29,958
  How are we going to carry it
        to the facility?

1006
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,162
         Get that coat.

1007
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,867
              Ew!

1008
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,005
           Stay back!

1009
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,278
             Okay!

1010
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,782
   We need to get to Palmer.

1011
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,359
            Hold on.

1012
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,494
          What is it?

1013
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,163
           Hold this.

1014
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,364
            Careful.

1015
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,034
     Something's not right.

1016
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,439
     I don't see anything.

1017
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,276
     Things are too quiet.
    Feels like we're walking
        into an ambush.

1018
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,813
   What, do you think they're
     hiding? Are they smart
        enough for that?

1019
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,451
 I don't know. Bruce could be.

1020
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,819
         They're here!

1021
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,856
             Here!

1022
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,197
           Watch out!

1023
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,517
          Argh! Argh!

1024
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,551
           ( gasps )

1025
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,157
            - Argh!
    - Hold on, you'll be OK.

1026
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,798
       ( zombie grunts )

1027
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,233
           I got it!

1028
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:23,038
       ( zombie grunts )

1029
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,847
    Let's go! Get the guns!
           Let's go!

1030
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,216
            Come on!

1031
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,759
Sergeant Cage!

1032
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:45,927
        He was stabbed.

1033
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,296
  Thank God he wasn't bitten!

1034
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,605
         ( Max grunts )

1035
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,810
    It looks like it missed
      any major arteries.

1036
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,211
 I can stitch these up for you.

1037
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,779
        Not right now,
    we don't have the time.

1038
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,281
  Sophie! Can you help me out.

1039
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:07,382
           Is that--

1040
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,783
   We got you a gift, doctor.

1041
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,788
  I can't believe you managed
          to get one.

1042
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,791
 Just tell us it was worth it.

1043
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,127
   That's what were are going
          to find out.

1044
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,798
       Careful, it bites.

1045
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:28,970
          Incredible.

1046
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,507
    The regen agent worked.

1047
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,375
       Yeah, really well.

1048
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,379
    You must be Amber Steel.

1049
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,815
      I'm Dr. Diane Palmer
        from the radio.

1050
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:45,320
       I... I'm so sorry.

1051
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,455
        For all of this.

1052
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,326
  Well, let's just figure out
        a way to fix it.

1053
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:55,663
    Bruce escaped before we
     had a chance to study
         his condition.

1054
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,067
   It appears as though once
     the virus takes hold,

1055
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,803
     the host is reanimated
   by an electrical response

1056
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,672
     in the nervous system.

1057
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,942
 Like when you take a dead frog

1058
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,111
   and attach it to a battery
        and it twitches.

1059
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,047
        The dead tissue
   is rebuilt to some extent.

1060
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,016
But based on your descriptions,

1061
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:18,386
      the reanimated have
      no thought processes

1062
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,055
besides the simple instincts to

1063
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,193
    move, eat and make more
          of its own.

1064
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,896
    It's not much different
 than a regular shark, really.

1065
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,765
    No, Bruce is different.
 He's smarter than the others.

1066
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,567
    He seems to be planning.

1067
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,435
     Well, he is the alpha.

1068
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,438
     He's the only one that
     was directly injected.

1069
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,608
 But without him here to study
 there's really no way to know

1070
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:44,846
       why Bruce reacted
       to the regen agent
        the way he did.

1071
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,948
         Have you found
          a cure yet?

1072
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,550
       That's what we are
         about to test.

1073
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:54,522
         Where's Roger?

1074
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:04,132
   I've been able to develop
     a rudimentary vaccine

1075
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,234
   against the initial serum.

1076
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,136
         Once injected
      into the bloodstream

1077
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,706
     of a healthy subject,
it should be able to neutralize

1078
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,943
the effects of the serum before
 the infection ever takes root.

1079
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,445
    Though we do have a lot
        of tests to run.

1080
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:21,115
This may be our only opportunity
         to gather data

1081
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,352
    without running the risk
   of creating another Bruce.

1082
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,189
 Could you secure the patient?

1083
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:35,330
   A shark's brain is smaller
        than a human's.

1084
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,665
    It's much more difficult
            to find.

1085
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,469
      Got to get in there
    and penetrate without...

1086
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,006
          damaging it.

1087
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,175
             There!

1088
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:51,713
          Did it work?

1089
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,056
              No.

1090
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,361
    So, what does that mean?

1091
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,663
  It means that it only works
         on the living.

1092
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:13,935
    The infected are already
         too far gone.

1093
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,337
  But there's got to be a way.

1094
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,806
    What about those people
  that got bit on the island?

1095
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,475
 You're saying there's no hope
           for them?

1096
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:24,178
           I'm sorry.

1097
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,347
  If we had more time, but...

1098
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,049
 No, this much will have to do.

1099
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,018
       Cage: She's right.

1100
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,854
  We've got to stop the virus
 before it gets off the island.

1101
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,356
      That's our priority.
   We must stick to the plan.

1102
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:38,693
 Activate the beacon, bring in
           the sharks

1103
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,229
      and blow this place
       to hell and back,

1104
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:45,233
         ( screaming )

1105
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,607
          ( screams )

1106
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,148
          ( whirring )

1107
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,224
       Here goes nothing.

1108
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,098
           ( sighs )

1109
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,366
            It's on.

1110
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,537
       Way to go, Roger.

1111
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,644
           ( pants )

1112
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,079
           Stay down!

1113
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,457
             Look!

1114
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:49,797
  They're... they're leaving!

1115
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,134
     Hey, they're leaving!

1116
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,335
          ( laughing )

1117
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,137
      And don't come back!

1118
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:03,144
            Wait...
    Where are you all going?

1119
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,346
     Oh, man! They're going
        to the facility!

1120
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:09,617
      C-4's been planted.
          Ready to go.

1121
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:15,623
             Ahm...

1122
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:17,658
           Sergeant--

1123
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,693
          Call me Max.

1124
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,996
              Max.

1125
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:24,265
      I never got a chance
  to thank you for everything

1126
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,534
 you've done for Sophie and me.

1127
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,770
           I just...

1128
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,508
    If anything goes wrong,

1129
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,176
       could you just...

1130
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,979
make sure Sophie gets home okay?

1131
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,114
       You have my word.

1132
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,683
But I'm not planning on letting
 anything happen to you either.

1133
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,037
     Sophie: What is that?

1134
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,206
    It's my brother, Ethan.

1135
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:13,347
       He was a lot like
         Sergeant Cage.

1136
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,983
      Always the first one
       into the hot zone.

1137
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,852
       He was very brave.

1138
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:23,057
   And he loved this country.

1139
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:26,627
   He died for this country.

1140
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:30,298
    He died on foreign soil
      of a wound that was

1141
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,900
       easily treatable.

1142
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,336
   His unit was too far away
       from the hospital

1143
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,338
         and first aid
        wasn't adequate.

1144
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,773
             And...

1145
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:46,414
    He died and there wasn't
 anything I could do about it.

1146
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,352
           ( sighs )

1147
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:55,423
I decided then that I was never
 gonna be that helpless again.

1148
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:59,460
     That's why I developed
        the regen agent.

1149
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:03,264
  To give soldiers like Ethan
         more endurance

1150
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,700
and better healing capabilities,
           you know?

1151
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,668
  To give them another chance.

1152
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,208
 But I... never thought this...

1153
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:15,910
      I can make it right.

1154
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,215
     I will make it right.

1155
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:28,656
         It's working.

1156
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,660
        They're coming.

1157
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,132
      Oh, they're inside.

1158
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,535
           - Inside?
            - Yeah.

1159
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,069
 There's a pool down below that
   has a gate that leads out
         to the ocean.

1160
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,472
   Yeah, that's how we bring
         the sharks in.

1161
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:47,008
    That's how Bruce got out
   after he killed almost all
          of my team.

1162
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,276
       Let's go. Come on.

1163
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:00,855
             Wait!

1164
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,426
  The vaccine's still inside.

1165
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,295
      If this doesn't work
        that vaccination

1166
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,398
is the last hope any of us have.

1167
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,400
      I'll be right back.

1168
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,070
      I'm coming with you!

1169
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:17,104
         Sophie, wait!

1170
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,239
       Get to the shore!

1171
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,740
          Let her go.

1172
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:25,813
  I don't know if you noticed,
       but your sister is
       kind of a badass.

1173
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,549
         Yeah, she is.

1174
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:30,885
             Okay.

1175
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,323
          Where is it?

1176
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,135
            Got it.

1177
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,339
          ( screams )

1178
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:55,710
            Take it!

1179
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:56,811
            - But...
           - I'm bit.

1180
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:59,213
            Just go!

1181
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,315
              Go!

1182
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,350
           I'm sorry.

1183
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,851
              Go!

1184
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,300
       I need to blow it
      before they get out.

1185
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,397
     Sophie! Sophie, hurry!

1186
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,434
             Do it!

1187
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,435
         Max: Three...

1188
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,704
          two... one!

1189
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,717
            Sophie!

1190
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:31,939
           Sophie...

1191
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,710
 It wasn't supposed to be you!

1192
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,489
       Amber, it's Bruce.

1193
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,831
           He must...

1194
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:59,166
 He must have let the others go
    in first to test it out.

1195
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,035
    I told you he was smart.

1196
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:12,680
             Amber!

1197
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,018
       Come on! Come on!

1198
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,386
        Amber, stop it!

1199
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,622
    Come on, if you want me,
            come on!

1200
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,694
       Come on! Come on!

1201
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:30,965
          Amber, stop!

1202
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,310
   Amber, get out of the way!
         I got a shot!

1203
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,653
          ( panting )

1204
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:14,642
          Amber, move!

1205
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:16,977
           ( cries )

1206
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:20,815
        Max: Watch out!

1207
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,618
         ( screaming )

1208
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,005
             Amber!

1209
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,953
          Don't miss!

1210
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,086
          ( panting )

1211
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,939
          Is he dead?

1212
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,042
         He better be.

1213
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:57,411
            Sophie?

1214
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,750
      Sorry about Sophie.

1215
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:10,491
          ( moaning )

1216
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:13,360
        Sophie? Sophie!

1217
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:14,695
            Sophie!

1218
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,864
       Give me something
        to cut her out!

1219
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,700
          ( moaning )

1220
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:26,707
        ( Amber grunts )

1221
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,076
        ( Amber pants )

1222
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,915
        Sophie! Sophie!

1223
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:41,922
          ( gasping )

1224
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:44,258
        Lester: Sophie?

1225
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,493
             Amber!

1226
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,866
       ( Sophie grunts )

1227
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:24,431
           Let's go.

1228
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,200
        ( Amber cries )

1229
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,952
          What's that?

1230
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,654
     Is the vaccine that's
    going to save humankind.

1231
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,958
     I need to get it into
    the right hands as soon
          as possible.

1232
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,032
            Come on.

1233
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,168
           Let's go.

1234
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:02,770
            Come on.

1235
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:06,473
           It's over.

1236
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:15,149
    The coast guard should
         be here soon.
