2
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,088
The question of happiness

3
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:31,213
has preoccupied
philosophers, poets

4
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,932
and pharmaceutical companies
for thousands of years.

5
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,608
Clearly, it's a tricky one.

6
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,528
When I graduated from
design school three years ago,

7
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:43,415
I had a definite plan.

8
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,168
Couple months at home,
put together a kickass portfolio,

9
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:50,371
then I'd take Manhattan
by storm.

10
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:54,287
And here is home.

11
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:56,727
West Orange, New Jersey.

12
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,491
Nice, huh?

13
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:03,207
OK, it's not Manhattan,
but, like I say, it's temporary.

14
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:07,130
I grew up here
with two families.

15
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:09,970
That's my dad in blue,
and that's his best friend, Terry.

16
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:11,970
The Inseparables.

17
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:15,214
They go jogging together
three times a week without fail.

18
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,526
You can set your clock by it.

19
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:20,446
You could say life in the Oranges
is dependable.

20
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,569
I can't believe
you made me do this.

21
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:25,453
Good for your appetite.
See you in an hour.

22
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:28,693
You can depend on Terry
to have a gadget for everything.

23
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:31,572
Walked 1.2 miles.
Only stopped twice.

24
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,045
That's great, honey.

25
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:35,091
And you can
depend on Cathy

26
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:37,044
to never hear
a single word he says.

27
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:38,884
Make sure you put your bicycle
in the garage.

28
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:40,888
And pull the pork
out of the freezer, honey.

29
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,251
Across the street,
our house.

30
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:48,771
Every year,
my mom gets more involved

31
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,287
with her carolling group.

32
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,244
They start rehearsing
in August.

33
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,963
# Jingle bells
Jingle all the way... #

34
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:56,688
And every year, my dad
hates them a little bit more.

35
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:03,564
OK, sure. I'm still here.
I'm a few years behind in my plan.

36
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,490
But you can't
rush these things.

37
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:08,491
Portfolios need
to be perfect, right?

38
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,282
Plus I have a day job
working in furniture, so...

39
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:14,802
...as far as I was concerned,
everything was on track.

40
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:18,006
# Happy birthday to you... #

41
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:21,009
That is, until what
happened... happened

42
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:23,246
Nina Ostroff.

43
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,085
When all this started,
she was at a safe distance,

44
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,281
3, 000 miles away
in San Francisco.

45
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,085
I Happy birthday to you. I

46
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,565
Make a wish, babe.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,208
And I was the fifth wheel

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,608
to our parents'
regular Saturday foursome.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Say it again.

50
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,887
OK.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,363
Un coup de birch.

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,003
Hey, Vanny.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,643
I read the most
interesting article

54
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,567
called 'The IKEA Conspiracy',

55
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,324
which you'd be
really fascinated by.

56
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,800
- What it imagines is a...
- Terry?

57
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,442
We need to call Nina.
We said 9:30.

58
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,039
I'm on it.

59
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,403
Vanessa, did you look at
that one-bedroom in Fort Lee?

60
00:03:06,558 --> 00:03:09,723
Yeah. It was, um, like a closet
in the basement.

61
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,242
There's always something, honey.

62
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:12,719
Don't be so choosy.
Nothing's perfect.

63
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,039
There was, you know,
one window.

64
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:17,042
- Paige, did I tell you...
- No room to breathe.

65
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,878
...that Joan Marshack
was the listing agent on that?

66
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:21,842
David, you are going
to really love this.

67
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:26,799
This speaker box communicates
wirelessly with my cell phone.

68
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,042
And guess where
I read about it first.

69
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:31,205
'Consumer Reports'. Thank you
so much for the subscription.

70
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,606
- I'm really enjoying it.
- You are consumingly welcome.

71
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:36,845
I don't even have to take
my cell phone out of my pocket.

72
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:38,318
Watch.

73
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,321
Dial Nina.

74
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:41,917
Please repeat request.

75
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,397
Dial Nina.

76
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,641
Maybe your pants
are blocking the signal.

77
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,236
They're cotton.

78
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:51,316
Nina's cell phone, dialling.

79
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,117
Nina - their daughter
and my best friend

80
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,284
from ages 0
to high school.

81
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,836
We spent hours together
planning our big escape.

82
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:02,960
I'm gonna live in New York.

83
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:04,436
And Paris.

84
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:06,843
And I'm gonna be a famous chef
and have a million lovers

85
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,316
who'll take me
all over the world

86
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:10,603
so I never have to come back
to New Jersey again.

87
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,482
It's like
there's no air here, right?

88
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:15,239
Totally.

89
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,355
You'll come too, right?

90
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:21,434
Are you kidding?

91
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,402
Until sophomore year,

92
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:28,842
when she abandoned me for
Liz Gaines and the Fun Bunch.

93
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:35,634
She also kissed and later gave
a hand job to Peter Fortunate.

94
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:38,914
I'd been secretly
in love with him forever.

95
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,997
Then, just as her parents
were lining her up

96
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,953
at some lame college
in Pennsylvania,

97
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:46,557
she decided she was
going to travel the world.

98
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:49,157
Or at least those parts

99
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,232
that were out of
her mothefs cell phone range.

100
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,279
Hello?

101
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,832
Happy birthday, sweetie!

102
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,640
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, Nina.

103
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,640
It's David and Paige.
Vanessa's here too.

104
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,516
It's true. I'm here.

105
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,960
Hey, Ethan.

106
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:09,839
I think Nina's fucking parents
are on the phone.

107
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,036
I didn't know I was having
a party. It was a surprise.

108
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,275
Honey, we can't hear you.

109
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:19,038
Ethan threw me
a surprise party.

110
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,915
It's so great.

111
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,392
Did you guys get
the pictures I sent?

112
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:24,275
Yes, we did.

113
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,111
More young men should have earrings
in their face.

114
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,671
What? I'm sorry, I can't
hear you. Am I on speaker?

115
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,551
Nina, what day are you
flying in for Thanksgiving?

116
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,754
Thanksgiving. Mom, um...

117
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,754
Uh, I don't think I'm gonna
make it for Thanksgiving.

118
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,030
Ethan's photography show's
next weekend, and it's a big deal.

119
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,989
Sweetie, we haven't
seen you for two years.

120
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,513
You haven't been home
in five years.

121
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,394
Since we visited you.
That's a long time.

122
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,869
Um...

123
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,037
Can you take me
off speaker, please?

124
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,630
Sorry, sweetie,
I'd have to disconnect you

125
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,753
to take you off speaker -
it's a very complex system.

126
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,913
OK.

127
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:01,157
Look, you're not
gonna like this, but...

128
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:03,392
Ethan and I
are getting married.

129
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:06,669
He proposed two weeks ago
on his birthday.

130
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,432
He took me out
to Baker Beach,

131
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:09,908
which overlooks
the Golden Gate Bridge,

132
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,912
and he got down on one knee
and everything.

133
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:15,472
- He proposed on his birthday?
- I don't understand.

134
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,395
I'm in love with him.

135
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,396
That's really great,
sweetie, but...

136
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,588
You're only 24 years old.

137
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,591
Nobody gets married
at 24 anymore.

138
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:26,591
People get married
when they're 17.

139
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,111
Not white girls
from New Jersey.

140
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,827
- Shh!
- Would you listen to yourself?

141
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:31,591
No, you listen -
you have made some

142
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,950
very questionable decisions
in your life.

143
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,470
Please don't
add to the list

144
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:39,315
by marrying some loser kid
with zero future.

145
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,434
OK. I have an idea.

146
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:46,634
If you think he's such a loser,
then don't come to the wedding!

147
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:52,745
Jesus, turn that thing down!

148
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:59,546
Down volume!
Down volume!

149
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:02,945
- Oh, God!
- Down volume!

150
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:12,105
You guys, it's getting late.
The party's over, OK?

151
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,032
Love you. 'Bye.

152
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,668
Amy, did you see Ethan?

153
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:18,265
Baby?

154
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,584
Ethan?

155
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,951
Ethan?

156
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:28,427
Uh, it's...
Gimme a sec.

157
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,951
Come on. I want to
get everybody out of here.

158
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,262
Hey, how's it going with
the, uh, couples counsellor?

159
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:49,986
I don't know.
She's so non-specific.

160
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:52,782
It's like talking to fog.

161
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:55,102
David and I know
where we stand with each other.

162
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,629
That's how we've lasted this long.
Somehow, it works.

163
00:07:57,782 --> 00:08:01,306
Well, don't look at me.
I just pretend Terry's invisible.

164
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,981
- Notice anything different?
- I sure do.

165
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:05,865
Nice new mini fridge.

166
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,462
I think it really
ties the room together.

167
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,065
-It's the Max 5950.
-It's the one you recommended.

168
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,108
From the patio series.
Good move.

169
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,301
Let's take a look
in the mini ice compartment.

170
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, boy.
It's really big, isn't it?

171
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,748
Now, this stuff is huge
in Europe.

172
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,387
And we've just landed
the American campaign.

173
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,100
- No kidding? Congrats.
- Thanks.

174
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,267
Russians like it
for breakfast.

175
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,667
Before the devil
knows you're dead.

176
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,786
Boy, it's, um...

177
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,466
Well...
Really not very good, is it?

178
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,463
-It's not good at all. No.
- No.

179
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,542
What's up
with these sheets?

180
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,899
You, um...

181
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:52,858
...spending a little extra time
out here?

182
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,179
Just a couple of nights a week.

183
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,706
Late-night TV.

184
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:24,421
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

185
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,456
Oh, sh...

186
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,302
Nina? Wow!

187
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:50,259
- David. Hi.
- It's been so long.

188
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:54,455
I thought you weren't
coming back for Thanksgiving.

189
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,502
Yeah, well...

190
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:58,422
Um...

191
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,139
Are my parents here?
Locked out.

192
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:05,542
They're in the back.

193
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,334
Last day of barbecue season.

194
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:13,054
What's going on?

195
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,817
- You OK?
- David?

196
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,373
Paige wants to know what
you did with the tong thing.

197
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:20,453
Hi, Mom.

198
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:23,733
I'm back for Thanksgiving.

199
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:26,053
We turned it into
a second den.

200
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,860
If your father's
in the first den

201
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:29,572
and I want some privacy,
I come here.

202
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,096
Honey,
I have this really cool

203
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,573
self-inflating mattress.

204
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,297
It fits perfectly in the corner
and it is really comfy.

205
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:40,180
But, you know, we have your
old bed frame out there in the...

206
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,219
...in the garage -
I can set it up for you.

207
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,500
- Take me two...two se...
- No, that's fine.

208
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:46,571
I'll only be here
a few days.

209
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:49,176
Why? Where are you
going to now?

210
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,776
I don't know.

211
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,451
I haven't figured it out yet.

212
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,498
Well, why don't you
stay here for a while?

213
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,091
I don't care -
it's not like we haven't

214
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,412
gotten used
to you being gone.

215
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,010
Can you hold off
on the guilt trips

216
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:05,491
for just a little while,
please?

217
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,211
I've had
a rough couple days.

218
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,730
I'd never seen Nina
with her tail between her legs.

219
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,530
But I didn't
have time to gloat.

220
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,734
Back on our side of the street,
we had our own problems.

221
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,254
That's not what I'm saying.

222
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,374
- What about Christmas?
- Come on, Paige.

223
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:24,650
- I'm trying here.
- Oh. Now I'm not trying.

224
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,536
Can't we have
a simple conversation?

225
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:31,573
- I make one suggestion...
- I don't want to go down there.

226
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:34,490
- You seem oblivious...
- Come on, Paige...

227
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:43,736
I apologise
for what I said about Ethan.

228
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,649
- Were you waiting for me?
- I'm not your enemy. Nina!

229
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:48,292
When you're a parent
some day,

230
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:49,856
you'll understand
what it feels like

231
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,807
to have your child hate you.

232
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,735
In case you're wondering,
that's your cue to say,

233
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,208
"I don't hate you, Mom."

234
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,775
I don't hate you.

235
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:02,652
I just get furious
thinking someone has hurt you.

236
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:09,691
Don't think I'm crazy.
This is just a thought. But, uh...

237
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,454
Toby's coming home
for Thanksgiving.

238
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:17,727
- Oh, my God.
- He's gotten very attractive.

239
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,249
That's all I'm saying.

240
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,326
He works for
the Federal Trade Commission.

241
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:22,849
Terrific. You date him.

242
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,806
Well, it's not like you two
don't have history.

243
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,494
- We kissed!
- Yeah.

244
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,966
Once, like, 10 years ago.

245
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,569
Can you at least let me unpack
before pimping me out?

246
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:33,410
OK, fine. But I'm gonna
tell you this for your own good.

247
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:36,369
You need to have a real
relationship with a real man.

248
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:38,969
It's time you grew up already!
Stop running away.

249
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:42,125
You know, you're right.
I'm being selfish.

250
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:43,725
The best thing
I can do right now

251
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,205
is fulfil
your insane suburban fantasy

252
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,685
where I marry
your best friend's son.

253
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:50,249
Now, you go call the catering hall
and I'll lube my vagina.

254
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,848
That was uncalled for.

255
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,487
Uh, there's 12 of us
in the delegation.

256
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,204
I'm really just...
just assisting my boss.

257
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,328
But the goal is to
tie our trade agreements

258
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,251
to stricter
environmental regulations

259
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:02,531
since things
are kind of a mess over there.

260
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,487
- China. That's great.
- Yeah, thanks.

261
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,443
You are gonna have
a great experience.

262
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,926
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's, like, a 30-hour flight.

263
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,123
- Honey, what about Christmas?
- Don't worry, Mom.

264
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:14,603
I fly back on the 24th.

265
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,290
That sounds
really great, Toby.

266
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:19,203
I hear that ultimate frisbee
is exploding over there.

267
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,446
In China. The, uh...

268
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:25,084
The Beijing club team
came in second at the World's.

269
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,846
If I see a game,
I'll let 'em know

270
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:30,045
I grew up across the street
from the guy who invented it.

271
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:33,770
Well. It wasn't just me. It was
also Jared Kass and, uh...

272
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:35,569
- Honey?
- Joel Silver.

273
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,326
Of course, Joel gets
most of the, you know...

274
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:40,166
...most of the play, being
a big movie producer and all.

275
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,569
Finally!

276
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:47,129
Where there's dessert,
there's hope.

277
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,521
Your mom told me about what
happened with that Ethan guy.

278
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,600
You OK?

279
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,400
Yeah.

280
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,688
I'm good, thanks.

281
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,919
So, what about you?

282
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,088
How's the liquor
advertising business going?

283
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,007
Still pushing booze
onto minors?

284
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,603
Yes, I am.

285
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,079
Actually,
I just got a promotion.

286
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,766
I'm now executive
vice-president,

287
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,239
creative accounts.

288
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,926
Congratulations.

289
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,207
Was that something
you wanted?

290
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:24,399
Not really.

291
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,478
You want me to spoon this
onto the plates?

292
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:28,122
Please.

293
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:31,759
Uh... Don't just eat it
right out the carton.

294
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:37,358
Is it good?

295
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:40,965
- It's cold.
- What?

296
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:45,122
Hey. I brought that ice-cream
for the pies.

297
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:47,164
He made me eat it.

298
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:50,165
Well, Cathy wants
to serve dessert.

299
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,085
Will you please
bring in some plates?

300
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:56,724
I still need Christmas lists
from everyone by tonight.

301
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,197
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

302
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,364
- Black Friday.
- Don't make fun.

303
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:04,324
Last year, I got there at 3am
and I was still 210 in line.

304
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:05,916
Why would anyone
want to shop

305
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:07,681
on the same day
as everyone else?

306
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,756
I hear that
they have fist fights

307
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,640
and people throw their children
at each other.

308
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,644
Terry! No.
It's really a very...

309
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:18,679
Very communal, Christmassy
experience. It's beautiful.

310
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,199
Listen, I know it's late,

311
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,839
but I think
we should have a toast.

312
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,363
It's Thanksgiving. We have
so much to be thankful for.

313
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,675
Toby is going to China.

314
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:28,155
Very exciting.

315
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,879
Nina is finally
back at home.

316
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:33,796
And Vanessa
continues to live among us,

317
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:35,634
bringing us joy every day.

318
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:37,681
To the Walling
and Ostroff clans.

319
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:41,402
Who knew that two families
could get this close?

320
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,874
Hear, hear.

321
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:45,598
I still think we could be
a little closer.

322
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,874
Well said.

323
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:55,001
Man, I thought your mom
was going to applaud

324
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:56,474
when she saw us
leave together.

325
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,481
The woman
is a total lunatic.

326
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,477
In the first three years
I was gone,

327
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,433
she sent me
letters from the cat.

328
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,840
"Dear Nina,
Don't be difficult.

329
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,400
"Call your mother
on her birthday."

330
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,920
That's great, actually.
I kind of like that.

331
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,560
Now you understand
why I never came back.

332
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,675
Yeah. No, I hear ya. But...

333
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:18,352
I'm glad you did.

334
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,719
Shut up.

335
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,595
Dance with me.

336
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:29,715
Totally.

337
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,951
You OK?

338
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,431
I need to get some water.

339
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,478
- Can I get some water?
- OK. Sit down, wild man.

340
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,112
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

341
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,954
- Hey.
- Toby needs water.

342
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,877
What are you doing up?

343
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,237
Just watching a little TV
in the man cave.

344
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,510
- Man cave?
- It's the pool house.

345
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,430
I got one of those
worldwide sports...

346
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:02,717
...something something package
your dad recommended.

347
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,073
There's this
Korean basketball league

348
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:06,876
which is completely crazy.

349
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:09,157
You know, it's not good
to eat peanut butter

350
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:10,629
this late at night.

351
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,109
It'll make you fat.

352
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:14,112
I'm not fat.

353
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,993
You will be if you
keep eating like that

354
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,468
at 2:00 in the morning.

355
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:19,275
And where'd you pick
this little factoid up?

356
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:21,032
I worked in
a lot of restaurants.

357
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,315
Restaurants
that serve peanut butter?

358
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:25,476
Look, do whatever you want.

359
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,072
I'm just saying
that you wouldn't look good fat.

360
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:32,434
I should get back downstairs.

361
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:34,354
Yeah, make your mother
very happy. You know that.

362
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:35,827
It's what I live for.

363
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:25,144
- Hi.
- Hi.

364
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:27,871
What happened to Toby?

365
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,944
I cut him up
in little pieces

366
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:31,904
and put him in the fridge
for later.

367
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:40,663
Who's playing?

368
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,107
I have no idea.

369
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:46,107
It's...it's the, um...

370
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:50,546
...guys in red against the...
the guys in white.

371
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:52,350
- White. I got it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:54,511
Go, reds.

373
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,343
Or White.

374
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,182
You know.

375
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:43,907
Oh, fuck.

376
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:50,227
One bedroom, high ceilings.
Close to the PATH train.

377
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,179
Ooh, washer dryer.

378
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:54,903
- Plus it's crazy bright.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,623
Well, that's morning light.

380
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,623
I don't want that.

381
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:02,627
Wow, that's, like,
your best excuse in two weeks.

382
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:04,338
Hello, Koosers.

383
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,418
- Did you sell that dresser?
- I did not.

384
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:08,018
She's not interested
in the apartment, Henry.

385
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:09,499
I told you.

386
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,186
What?

387
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:12,942
What do you mean,
"I told you"?

388
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,782
You've been talking about
moving out for two years.

389
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:17,705
You know what?
I'm saving money. Alright?

390
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,865
I have a very definite plan.

391
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,221
You mean that "stay at home,
corrode your soul" plan?

392
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:24,341
No, no - the plan
where I move to the city

393
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,981
and I work with
a big designer.

394
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,265
I've already made
serious contacts.

395
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,261
From where'?

396
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:35,698
Huffman Koos? Well, you know me
and her and Marlon.

397
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:38,541
Hey, I'm serious.
We're worried about you.

398
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,856
OK, thank you.
I got it under control.

399
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:42,543
You guys
go worry about yourselves.

400
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,296
Wow. There she is'

401
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,663
1 pm. Very impressive.

402
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,096
So? Did you have fun
last night?

403
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:54,935
I'm sure you'd love
a full report.

404
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,104
You know,
some mothers and daughters

405
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,895
actually talk about
these things, like friends.

406
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,182
It's not happening.

407
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,143
Well, maybe Toby will be
better company than you.

408
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,702
Hi!

409
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:15,818
Try and control yourself.

410
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,737
Hey, Nina.

411
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:24,937
- Morning, Cathy.
- Good morning, Tobias.

412
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:27,734
- Uh, you forgot your sweater.
- Thank you.

413
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,693
Can I get you
some breakfast, honey?

414
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:32,057
No, thanks. I'm OK. Thanks.

415
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,541
Well, I'll give you two
some privacy.

416
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,420
There you are.

417
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,533
I can hear you
hovering out there!

418
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:45,220
Fine.

419
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:48,213
You're looking a little crispy
this morning.

420
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:50,413
Oh, thank you.
You can really put 'em away.

421
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:53,333
Did I, uh...
Did I pass out?

422
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,336
Yeah. Mmm, pretty much.

423
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:57,695
Sorry about that.

424
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:00,372
- No.
- Um...

425
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,331
Look.
Uh, I was thinking.

426
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:07,900
I had a really fun time last night
before passing out, and...

427
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,179
...I'm supposed to have dinner
with my folks tonight.

428
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:13,015
And being as
I'm leaving in two days,

429
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,731
I thought, you know,
maybe you'd like to join us

430
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,018
so we could
hang out more.

431
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,134
Yeah. Dinner with you and
your parents, it...sounds great.

432
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:32,373
- Come on, Toby.
- Hold.

433
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,857
Alright. OK.

434
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,929
- Let's go, Toby.
- Hold.

435
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:41,778
Toby, it's called
the fast-moving tile game.

436
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,849
Hold.

437
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,576
- Let's go, Toby.
- Hold!

438
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:51,096
OK. OK.

439
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,896
Actually,
just go out ahead of me.

440
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:54,772
Oh!

441
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:57,448
5, the 13. I'm out!

442
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,215
- What?
- Ah. Yes.

443
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:01,928
Now, who's gonna help me
with the dishes?

444
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:03,571
I will, Mom. Wait.

445
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:05,648
Hang on a sec.
I gotta take this. It's work.

446
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,367
This is Toby.

447
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,011
Oh, hello, sir.

448
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:10,488
Uh-huh.

449
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:11,967
- No, no, it's no problem.
- Yeah.

450
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:13,807
I think maybe
I'll go pick up a movie

451
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,450
in case you want to
watch something later.

452
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:18,411
- That sounds fun.
- I'll come with you.

453
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:21,174
Keep you company
while Toby does the dishes.

454
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,129
Look.

455
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,329
What happened last night
was a mistake.

456
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:38,734
- OK?
- No, you're right.

457
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:44,650
Relax, OK?
It was nothing.

458
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,009
And you stopped it.
You're absolved.

459
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,972
Hello in there?

460
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:00,685
Is there anyone in there?

461
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:03,768
You just have to
instigate trouble.

462
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:06,728
I do not instigate trouble.

463
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,204
Well, OK.

464
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,891
Well, then, Why'd you
come to dinner tonight?

465
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:11,364
Toby invited me.

466
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,291
And now that we're
talking about instigators,

467
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:15,287
you leaned into me.

468
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:17,004
I leaned into you?

469
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:19,007
- I leaned... I did not lean.
- Yes, you did.

470
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:20,724
- You leaned into me.
- What?!

471
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:22,891
Oh... He said, she said.

472
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:25,883
He said, she said.

473
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,722
Where did that come from?

474
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,802
I have no idea
where that came from.

475
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:37,846
I'm not instigating.

476
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,644
I've been thinking
about getting

477
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,809
one of those
giant electric snow globes.

478
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,004
You ever seen one of those?
Really big ones?

479
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,168
Fantastic.

480
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,284
Mom?

481
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,523
We're in here, honey.

482
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,167
I'm going out.

483
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,403
Well!

484
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,080
Well, don't you look nice?

485
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,767
Thanks.

486
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
So is Toby
taking you somewhere?

487
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,280
- Uh, yeah.
- OK. OK.

488
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,803
- Fine.
- Mom!

489
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,683
Give me some room.

490
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:36,119
Fine. Have fun.

491
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,643
Is she eating with us?

492
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:44,679
Toby is taking her out.
She was all dressed up.

493
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:46,562
- Toby already left for DC.
- What?

494
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,125
Yeah, first thing
this morning.

495
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,122
Some congressman wanted
to be with the delegation

496
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:51,838
before they went to China.

497
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:24,316
"Left this morning."
Oh, shit!

498
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:38,558
- H-hello?
- Mom?

499
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:40,723
Listen. I lied earlier.

500
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:42,642
I'm not going out with Toby.

501
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,518
He actually left for Washington
this morning.

502
00:26:44,674 --> 00:26:47,401
- Oh?
- Yeah.

503
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:51,721
I'm meeting Meredith Lovett.
Remember her?

504
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,197
I didn't tell you because
I know you don't like her.

505
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:58,402
Oh, honey, thank you.
Thank you for telling me.

506
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:02,361
You know...
You don't have to lie to me.

507
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:04,554
I know.

508
00:27:04,713 --> 00:27:06,437
So where are you going?

509
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:11,241
Uh, we're going to the Regal
to see a movie.

510
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,553
Uh, Mom?

511
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:17,232
Thanks...for being so cool

512
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:19,640
and letting me come back
and stay and everything.

513
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,640
I've been feeling really
tossed around lately, so...

514
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,196
You know.
Thanks for being there.

515
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:30,072
OK, well...
I'll see you later for dinner.

516
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:36,591
Oh, my...

517
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,673
Whoa!

518
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,870
Cathy.

519
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,232
- What are you...?
- I'm, uh...

520
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:21,833
- What are you...
- I'm not, uh... Nothing.

521
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:25,513
Paige and I had a fight,
and I spent the night here. So...

522
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:29,872
Oh, my God!

523
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:31,632
Hey, Nina.

524
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:33,228
- What are you...
- Oh, my God!

525
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:34,828
Cathy! Slow down.

526
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:38,195
Slow down? I can read
an ice bucket, David.

527
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,389
- Cathy.
- Oh, my God!

528
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:43,395
I'm gonna throw up!

529
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:51,027
- Jesus, David!
- Paige, listen to me.

530
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,107
Just tell me how long
it's been going on.

531
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,427
We kissed. That's it.

532
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,031
Then what the hell were you
doing in a goddamn motel room?

533
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:59,834
This...

534
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,106
I'm sorry.
The whole thing was wrong.

535
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:05,587
But let's be honest.

536
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,830
Things have not been good
between us for a long time.

537
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:09,469
Oh, God, don't do that.

538
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,025
Don't apologise and then
blame me in the same sentence.

539
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,194
Come on, Paige.
You're not happy either.

540
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:16,746
It's not about
being happy, David!

541
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,825
Well, then, what is it?

542
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:40,152
Jesus, say something already.

543
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:42,268
I will say something
when I want.

544
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:44,824
You don't get to decide
when I say something. I decide!

545
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:47,428
- Then decide already!
- I'll decide.

546
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:50,868
You have caused
some serious trouble

547
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:52,311
in the past, young lady.

548
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:53,871
Don't you
roll your eyes at me.

549
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:55,987
I'm sorry, it doesn't work
when you try to play

550
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,867
the stern father - it looks like
you're pretending.

551
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:00,107
Your father is not pretending!
We are furious!

552
00:30:00,262 --> 00:30:01,670
I'm not pretending.

553
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:03,383
David and I,
we like each other.

554
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,790
- Oh, my God.
- We've always been close.

555
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,983
It's not like we planned this.
It just happened.

556
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,747
- You like each other?
- Yeah.

557
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:11,223
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

558
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,902
I know what this is -
this is some sick revenge

559
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,949
because we weren't supportive
of you and Ethan.

560
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:17,585
So now you're gonna
teach us a lesson.

561
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,990
Believe it or not, Mom,
this isn't about you!

562
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:22,465
And now that you mention it,
you're the one who told me

563
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,869
that I should find myself a man
and not a boy.

564
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:28,060
Oh, God!
Paige is leaving!

565
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,901
I bet you didn't
think about her for a second.

566
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,708
I wasn't thinking
about any of you.

567
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:34,021
- Like I said, it just happened!
- Where are you going?

568
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:35,828
- Across the street.
- No, you're not.

569
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:38,742
Nina, get back here. Nina!
Terry, do something.

570
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,579
Hi.

571
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,026
Hey.

572
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:05,063
I'm sorry.

573
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,703
Don't be.

574
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:18,026
What did you say
to your mother?

575
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,018
I told her I liked you.

576
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:24,102
Alright, well,
it's time to kill myself.

577
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,102
- Somebody shoot me.
- Vanessa.

578
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:29,061
No. You know what?
Don't even try to explain this.

579
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:30,701
And you, well...

580
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:32,941
I thought the Peter Fortunato
hand job was bad.

581
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:35,181
Would you fuck off?

582
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:37,061
I'll fuck off
when you blow me, slut.

583
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:39,824
Oh, great.

584
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:44,384
Look, Van, this has
nothing to do with you.

585
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:46,981
What do you mean,
it has nothing to do with me?

586
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,657
Oh, man, Terry.

587
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:52,344
I am so sorry.

588
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:53,936
Ooh!

589
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:56,900
- Whoa!
- Ow! Ouch!

590
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:58,584
- Dad!
- OK, I hurt my ankle. Ow.

591
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:01,539
- You OK?
- No, I'm not OK. Ow.

592
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:04,216
Old cow eating young grass.

593
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,903
Uh, that's a saying
when older man

594
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:07,779
go with
a much younger woman.

595
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:10,696
Man, you Asian people
have the best expressions.

596
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:14,619
Don't worry, Vanessa.
Usually, it doesn't last.

597
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:16,542
At first,
I thought Henry was right,

598
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:19,258
as the old cow
clearly had regrets.

599
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:22,021
But it wasn't so simple.

600
00:32:23,294 --> 00:32:25,138
My mother packed her things
and moved into

601
00:32:25,294 --> 00:32:26,615
the only B & B in town...

602
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:28,574
Well, there's no other guests
at the moment,

603
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:30,055
so you can
take your pick

604
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,894
of any one of
the 10 rooms we have.

605
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:35,218
...and was determined to make
my dad pay for what he had done.

606
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:37,534
I'll take all of them.

607
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:41,053
My dad, left on his own,
moped for days

608
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:44,017
and endlessly checked to see
if my mom wanted to talk.

609
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,137
She didn't.

610
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:49,053
When I dated Andrew Hester,
he was 28.

611
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:51,296
And I learned so much
from him.

612
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:52,816
Meanwhile,
the young grass moved in

613
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,220
with her deep-thinking friend,
Meredith Lovett...

614
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:57,740
They're older. They're just better
at everything, right?

615
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,532
...and sat there hoping
that my dad might call.

616
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,252
He didn't.

617
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:05,572
He kept trying
to call Terry, but...

618
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:07,499
...Terry wasn't ready to talk.

619
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:14,176
They hadn't gone
for a morning jog in weeks.

620
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:17,419
Nina was now responsible
for breaking up two couples.

621
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:21,415
Cathy visited my mother
every day

622
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,054
and, in an attempt
to relieve her guilt

623
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,618
over what
her daughter had done,

624
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,091
brought kettle corn.

625
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,658
Lots of it.

626
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,655
Probably 'cause there isn't
a Hallmark card that says,

627
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,851
"Sony my daughter
tried to bang your husband."

628
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,698
And as for me,
I was stuck between my mother,

629
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,414
who continued to bury
her feelings in holiday cheer...

630
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,570
- That's very lovely, Paige.
- The middle range needs tuning.

631
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,174
I'm on it.

632
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:49,450
...and my dad, who started acting
like everything was OK.

633
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:50,930
Look good here, right?

634
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,729
Which was harder to take
than the moping.

635
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:59,216
So does this mean
you're done avoiding me?

636
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:04,213
I was not avoiding you. I...
I needed time to think.

637
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:07,336
And I want to make sure that
everything's OK between us.

638
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,812
Are you
breaking up with me?

639
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:14,849
Because I didn't know
we were together.

640
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:22,052
I just think that we should just
keep away from each other.

641
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,171
I think that would be best
for everyone now.

642
00:34:26,286 --> 00:34:27,934
OK.

643
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:31,654
Yeah. Fine.

644
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,531
If that's what you want.

645
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:35,453
OK.

646
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,286
So we're good.

647
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:38,767
Yeah.

648
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:40,650
Old friends.

649
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:48,370
OK, so, what do you
want me to do?

650
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,613
You want me to go? Or...
I could stay. Or...

651
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:54,973
You can do whatever you want.
You can go, you can stay.

652
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,286
Oh, my God. Can you stop?

653
00:34:57,445 --> 00:35:00,445
I don't even recognise you.
Can't we just be normal?

654
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:01,968
What's normal'?

655
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,849
My wife has left me.

656
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:06,012
I betrayed
everyone I care about.

657
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:07,648
I don't do this.

658
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,649
- I'm not that guy.
- OK. OK. Look.

659
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,364
I'm willing to go along

660
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,007
with whatever
you want here, David.

661
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:14,691
Honestly.

662
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:16,404
But...

663
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:18,932
Let me ask you
one question.

664
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:22,683
Are you happy?

665
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:29,087
It's not about being happy.

666
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:35,887
If you could lean across
this table right now

667
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,171
and kiss me...

668
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,570
...and no-one would say
it was wrong

669
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,522
and there were no rules...

670
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:46,926
...would you do it?

671
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,602
That's a stupid question.
I'm not gonna answer that.

672
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:53,245
Would you do it?

673
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,646
What, if there were no rules? Yeah.
Sure, I would.

674
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,802
There are no rules.

675
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:05,889
# Deck the halls,
deck the halls, deck the halls

676
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,125
I Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

677
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:10,365
I Fa-la-la-la-la,

678
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,921
I For 'tis the season

679
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:15,165
I Fa-la-la-la-la,

680
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,884
I Don we now our gay apparel

681
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,124
I Fa-la-la-la-la,

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,767

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,320

685
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:37,045
I La-la. #

686
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,763
Very good.
Very good, people.

687
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:44,406
Let's remember
to watch the pace.

688
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:46,478
Christmas is three weeks away.

689
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,602
I know there have been
requests

690
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:51,562
to start the Christmas Eve
walk-and-sing earlier.

691
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:53,999
If we get going by 4:00,
then we will still have time

692
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:55,566
to make Christmas dinner.

693
00:36:55,718 --> 00:36:57,638
That's great, Diane,
but it's not dark out at 4:00,

694
00:36:57,797 --> 00:37:00,121
and if it's not dark out, then
the candles are pretty useless.

695
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:01,882
- Right?
- Uh, my parents are coming.

696
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,882
I need to start
at least by 5:00.

697
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:07,202
We always sing at 6:00!
Every year.

698
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:09,758
We can't just change things
because you feel like it.

699
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,285
Or you feel like it,
or you feel like it.

700
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:14,445
Some things
need to stay the same.

701
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:19,077
Now, if this little
bitch session is over,

702
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:21,277
I would like to move on
to the 'Tannenbaum' medley.

703
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:29,837
We have got...51 hours before
I have to be back at work.

704
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:41,360
Atlantic City -
where New Jersey comes to hide.

705
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,599
Are you prepared?

706
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:50,235
Give me a dollar, yo.

707
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,435
# ..for more time
than I saw

708
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,878
# It seems so small

709
00:37:57,354 --> 00:38:01,915
# The tide swept inside of me
almost entirely

710
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:07,039
# All that I thought was a constant
had ﬂoated away... #

711
00:38:07,193 --> 00:38:08,481
Yeah!

712
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,281
# So I just stay

713
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:17,361
# Will you wait for me? #

714
00:38:20,113 --> 00:38:24,673
# We'll just wait and see

715
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:30,033
# The moon on the water
is carried to the land

716
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:35,801
# As the seagulls were silent,
I heard what you said so clear

717
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:39,400
# We can't stay here

718
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,956
# So clear

719
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,080
# We can't stay here

720
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:50,119
# Stay clear

721
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:53,791
# We can't stay here. #

722
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,470
It's pouring with rain

723
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,550
and the mud and rocks
are flying down the trail,

724
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:07,032
and I really wanted to push on,
but this ranger said

725
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,470
that he'd arrest us both
if we didn't go right back down.

726
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,351
Which sucks, 'cause...
we were only three peaks short.

727
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,434
Wait, so,
if you climb all 46 peaks,

728
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,957
what does that mean -
you get a prize, or...?

729
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,550
No. You do not
get a prize.

730
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,629
But you'd get to
call yourself a 46er.

731
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,993
Which, in some circles,
is pretty spectacular.

732
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:26,513
- Sounds...
- David!

733
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:29,517
Hey. How's it going, buddy?

734
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,273
- Hey.
- You remember Anne?

735
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:33,033
- Anne, sure. Hi. Yes.
- Hi, David.

736
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:37,555
Uh, Nina, this is, uh,
Gideon Allen, who I work with,

737
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,548
and Anne.

738
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,755
Hi.

739
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:44,829
- Nice to meet you.
- Nina and I are, uh...

740
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,995
We're old friends.

741
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:53,308
It's nice
to meet you, Nina.

742
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:56,794
So, uh...

743
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:58,791
You guys come here a lot?

744
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:00,388
Few times a year.

745
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:03,395
Uh, Anne's actually
a fantastic poker player.

746
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:07,195
Do you guys
want to join us?

747
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:08,754
- Um...
- You know what?

748
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,794
There's a stud tournament
starting in a couple of minutes.

749
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:12,866
- So...
- You didn't come here to eat?

750
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,034
No - we're just
checking out the menu,

751
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:20,591
for when we eat later.

752
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:24,106
Well, if we're still here,
you can join us then.

753
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:26,865
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

754
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,153
- See you later maybe.
- That would be great.

755
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,032
- Yeah.
-'Bye. Nice to meet you.

756
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:37,232
That was Gideon and Anne.

757
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,345
Hey. There she is.

758
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,064
You back from your
"need to think" vision quest?

759
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:58,423
Yeah. Took a ride out to the beach.
Really cleared my head.

760
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,823
Where'd you stay?

761
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:06,627
Uh, I stayed at
a bed-and-breakfast.

762
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:09,991
It's really nice
in the winter. The air.

763
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:14,703
I'm gonna make some coffee.
You want some?

764
00:41:14,862 --> 00:41:18,070
I don't drink coffee.

765
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:23,262
What...

766
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:25,463
What if you and I
took a trip,

767
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,389
out to where I was,
near Point Pleasant?

768
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:30,105
- You used to love it there.
- Just the two of us? Together?

769
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:33,066
Yeah. Just like we used to.

770
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:36,265
Be great.
There's nobody around. It's...

771
00:41:38,141 --> 00:41:40,628
Yeah. Sure. Maybe.

772
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,909
Whatever.

773
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,303
We just didn't want
to lie to you anymore.

774
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,063
Oh, thank you.

775
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:12,467
Thank you both for showing
such good judgment.

776
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:15,380
- Um... I'm gonna go home.
- Vanessa, please stay.

777
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:17,066
No, let her go.
She'll never understand.

778
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,539
Never understand what?

779
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:21,143
What, that you have to go
from man to man

780
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:23,022
to validate
your pathetic existence?

781
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,699
Terry, you want to go?
You and me? Make out in the back?

782
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:27,266
Huh? Right now. Let's go.
Let's do it.

783
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:29,305
- Vanessa!
- David!

784
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:34,226
You told me that this situation
with my daughter was finished.

785
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:37,018
It was over.
Terry, it was.

786
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:39,698
Look, we both realise
that this is wrong.

787
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,298
Oh, you think?

788
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:43,104
And, yeah, I know,
it's selfish, and it's...

789
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:44,784
...it's, uh...

790
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,901
It's unacceptable. OK.

791
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:52,378
But if it makes us happy,
why do we have to stop it?

792
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,298
I don't want to stop.
I don't want to stop.

793
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:58,696
I want to be happy.

794
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:11,216
What do you plan on doing?

795
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,699
Are you going
to stay in New Jersey?

796
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,935
I'll get a job
in a restaurant.

797
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,376
I've already called Shelly.
He said he could use the help.

798
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,302
Shelly's restaurant
is serious.

799
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:24,663
I'm serious. I've worked in
a serious restaurant before.

800
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:28,022
So, if you want us
to take you seriously,

801
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:29,658
then let me ask you
a few questions.

802
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:31,778
OK.

803
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,494
Would you say that
the connection you're feeling

804
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,141
is genuine,
that what you have is real?

805
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:39,614
- Yes.
- Yes.

806
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:41,094
Absolutely.

807
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:42,661
Now, we're all aware

808
00:43:42,813 --> 00:43:44,341
there's a significant
age difference here.

809
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:47,255
If what we're feeling
is real, and genuine,

810
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:49,301
then age doesn't matter.

811
00:43:49,453 --> 00:43:53,098
I guess, then, what
I'm asking is, Nina, honey...

812
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:57,220
...are you OK
sucking David's old balls?

813
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:58,933
- Cathy!
- Oh, my God.

814
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:01,340
- Cathy.
- It's a legitimate question.

815
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:03,173
His balls are much older
than her.

816
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:05,580
- Vanessa!
- You are being such an asshole.

817
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:07,980
Do not call your mother
an a-hole in this house!

818
00:44:08,132 --> 00:44:09,779
Thank you, Terry! Thank you.

819
00:44:09,932 --> 00:44:12,496
I'm sorry I lied to you.

820
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,135
This is a nightmare.

821
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:17,577
I mean, I...I understand
you're going through this, like,

822
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:19,259
pathetic meltdown
or something,

823
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:21,692
but, like, if you had to
fuck somebody half your age,

824
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:23,531
did it have to be her?

825
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:29,379
Oh, and by the way, Dad,
um, what about Mom?

826
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,574
It was right about then

827
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,010
that shit started
to really get weird.

828
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,214
My father started
calling in sick to work a lot.

829
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:54,018
Gadgets McGee was unnerved
to see Nina with my dad.

830
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,857
But he was also struck
by how alive his friend seemed.

831
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:03,569
Inspired to recapture
his own lost youth, or something,

832
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:06,009
he went online and found
a pick-up ultimate frisbee game

833
00:45:06,168 --> 00:45:07,532
in Paramus.

834
00:45:07,688 --> 00:45:10,732
Hey, guys! You, uh...
you got room for one more?

835
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,972
No daylight. No daylight.

836
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:17,928
So it was really Jared Kass
and I, and Joel Silver...

837
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:19,768
Joel Silver,
the movie producer?

838
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:21,172
Yeah. Yeah.

839
00:45:22,248 --> 00:45:23,731
My mother
had been making herself

840
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,568
mysteriously unavailable.

841
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,931
But, as all our neighbours
discovered...

842
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,692
...she hadn't completely lost sight
of the Christmas spirit.

843
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:40,295
Terry!

844
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,126
Everything was changing.

845
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:43,607
Terry!

846
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:45,371
No-one even recognised
each other anymore.

847
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:50,967
- Smoothie?
- Oh, good God.

848
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:56,086
Very good.

849
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:58,329
Now kiss the chef.

850
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:12,133
Maybe they are
really in love.

851
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:13,605
You said it doesn't last.

852
00:46:13,764 --> 00:46:16,045
You said that the grasses only
wanted the cows for their money.

853
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:17,765
Usually that is the case,
but not always.

854
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:19,932
- Your dad is pretty cute.
- Don't be gross, OK?

855
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:21,928
Just because you haven't gotten
laid in, like, three weeks.

856
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:24,048
Perhaps your problem is
more with Nina than your father.

857
00:46:24,204 --> 00:46:25,971
Oh, is that so, Henry?
Why is that?

858
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:27,444
Because maybe
you are jealous,

859
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:30,844
because she has travelled
many places and has lived,

860
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:33,765
because she takes chances.

861
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:35,244
No. You know what?

862
00:46:35,404 --> 00:46:36,931
You, my friend,
have breathed in

863
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,927
a little too much
of this cheap pine wax, OK?

864
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,964
'Cause she's a selfish skank.
And he's selfish too.

865
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:44,404
Yeah, but if he
really is happier with her

866
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:45,927
and you make him stop,

867
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,643
then you're the one
who's being selfish.

868
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:51,163
That is maybe
the most intelligent thing

869
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:52,762
you have ever said.

870
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,169
Hey.

871
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:13,169
What is
Barnyard International?

872
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:16,322
Well, um... See those presents
you got at babyGap?

873
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:18,609
Instead of giving those
to a baby

874
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,321
who might already
have lots of clothes,

875
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:22,401
why not help a baby
who doesn't have any food?

876
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:23,881
They're not for a baby.

877
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,481
They're for my husband's
new girlfriend.

878
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,084
Here's some pamphlets.

879
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,964
"One goat
can provide a family

880
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:36,247
"with enough milk
for an entire year."

881
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,168
It's like the Christmas gift
that keeps giving.

882
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,879
Yeah. It is.

883
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,960
That's good. Can I use that?

884
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:46,563
Sure.

885
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:56,166
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

886
00:48:03,878 --> 00:48:06,878
There are gift receipts inside,
if anyone wants to return them.

887
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:12,242
I think after Christmas Eve,

888
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:14,842
we should demand
that Paige have dinner with us.

889
00:48:17,797 --> 00:48:19,477
What are you doing?

890
00:48:19,637 --> 00:48:21,284
Come here.

891
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,837
- I have toothpaste in my mouth.
- I don't care.

892
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:32,760
Come here.

893
00:48:43,436 --> 00:48:46,480
OK. Thank you
for dropping me off.

894
00:48:46,636 --> 00:48:48,677
I got you these.

895
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:55,555
Chef's clogs.

896
00:48:55,715 --> 00:48:57,602
You said after working last night,
your feet hurt, so...

897
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,434
You're so sweet.

898
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:09,918
OK. You're gonna
make me late.

899
00:49:10,074 --> 00:49:11,874
Whoo!

900
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:22,953
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

901
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:25,274
Um...

902
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:26,917
What?

903
00:49:29,073 --> 00:49:30,393
Nothing.

904
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:31,873
What's up?

905
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:33,354
Nothing.

906
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,117
Come on.
Tell me what's wrong.

907
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:39,313
- I...
- I love you, Nina.

908
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:44,753
You shit. You suck.
I wanted to say it first.

909
00:49:46,512 --> 00:49:49,273
Well, now I'm not saying it.
You blew it, buddy.

910
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:53,475
I'm just kidding.
I love you too.

911
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:01,031
You guys were married
for 28 years.

912
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:03,439
If anyone should call,
it should be him.

913
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,631
- Do you have any perfume?
- No.

914
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,475
What?! Where are you
even going?

915
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,031
Well, I read about
a late-evening cabaret show

916
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,674
that begins at 9:30.

917
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,078
- I'm taking myself out.
- Cabaret?

918
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:17,359
Am I the only one
who's dealing with this?

919
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,111
I mean, don't you
want to come back home?

920
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:24,510
I'm not sure.

921
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,190
I'm having a good time
for once.

922
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:31,277
I'd like to see you
do the same.

923
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,396
Let's go, guys!
Pick up the pace!

924
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:38,229
Hey, Mondo!
Where's my rigatoni? Let's go!

925
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:39,873
Bring it up, parmigiana.

926
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:41,829
Nina! Plate 27!

927
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:43,352
Alright, guys-

928
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:45,832
On 24, I got a mahi mahi
and a chicken parmigiana.

929
00:50:45,988 --> 00:50:47,875
Thanks for sending her to me.
She's a good worker.

930
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:49,436
- Well, that's great.
- Chef likes her.

931
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,753
Haven't seen you and Paige
for a while. It's good to see you.

932
00:50:52,908 --> 00:50:55,353
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

933
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:27,190
- Done with your appetiser, sir?
- Sorry?

934
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:28,874
Done with
your appetiser, sir?

935
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:30,989
Yeah. That... Yeah.
That's great. Thanks.

936
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:37,233
Hello.

937
00:51:38,545 --> 00:51:40,073
Hi, Paige.

938
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,552
Nice move
on the Christmas card.

939
00:51:44,705 --> 00:51:46,352
Thank you.

940
00:51:47,385 --> 00:51:50,506
- Dining alone?
- Uh, yeah. I guess.

941
00:51:51,824 --> 00:51:53,668
So how are you doing?
Is everything...

942
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:55,625
Sit down. Don't have to
make this uncomfortable.

943
00:51:55,784 --> 00:51:57,267
Just...

944
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:02,152
Plus, you know
how I hate pleasantries.

945
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:05,748
What about you?

946
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:07,911
You look happy.

947
00:52:09,304 --> 00:52:10,864
Things are OK.
You know, I'm...

948
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:13,468
If you're happy,
you can say so.

949
00:52:13,623 --> 00:52:15,390
You don't need
to spare my feelings.

950
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:19,427
Just...be genuine,
David, please.

951
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,187
Please.

952
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,743
Yes. I'm happy-

953
00:52:29,142 --> 00:52:30,702
Thank you.

954
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:32,422
Yeah.

955
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:35,742
Look, I know
there's nothing I can say...

956
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,310
Then don't try.

957
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:39,261
Paige, stop. Please.

958
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:41,669
This is exactly
how we got to this.

959
00:52:43,062 --> 00:52:47,503
OK, not exactly.
It's partly.

960
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:50,509
We stopped talking
to each other.

961
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:55,425
I used to love who I was
around you.

962
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,308
What happened to us?

963
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,348
We used to have fun.
Remember that?

964
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,821
We used to laugh.
God, you were so funny.

965
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,627
I'm still funny.

966
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,864
I'm... Ask them.

967
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:34,586
Shelly just fired me!

968
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:36,266
Hey, hey.

969
00:53:36,418 --> 00:53:39,745
- What happened?
- Oh! This is fucking bullshit!

970
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:42,462
- What? Why?
- Because he's not an idiot.

971
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:45,378
He saw you and Paige, and he
saw me, and he figured it out.

972
00:53:45,538 --> 00:53:47,861
He said he didn't want
to be in the middle of it.

973
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:50,026
And I was good at that job!

974
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:52,141
Why...

975
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:54,578
Why were you talking to her?

976
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:56,417
She came into the restaurant.

977
00:53:56,576 --> 00:53:59,337
What do you expect me to do?

978
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:01,820
I saw you sitting with her,
and I just thought...

979
00:54:04,377 --> 00:54:05,697
Thought what?

980
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:07,624
I don't know.

981
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:11,984
You looked normal together.

982
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:21,823
Can we please get out of here?

983
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:31,258
# I really can't stay

984
00:54:31,414 --> 00:54:33,214
# But, baby,
it's cold outside

985
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,255
- # I've got to go away
- # But, baby, it's cold outside

986
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:38,019
# This evening has been...

987
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,702
# Been hoping
that you drop in

988
00:54:39,854 --> 00:54:41,218
# So very nice

989
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:44,418
# I'll hold your hands
They're just like ice

990
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:46,374
# My mother
will start to worry... I

991
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,301
Hi. Mrs Ostroff'?

992
00:54:48,454 --> 00:54:50,101
We've never met.

993
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,382
But I'm Ethan.

994
00:54:57,174 --> 00:54:58,898
You're our leader.
You can't quit!

995
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:02,294
Christmas Eve is in, like,
six days. They're counting on us.

996
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:06,621
Try and calm down. Calm down.

997
00:55:06,773 --> 00:55:09,654
Calm down. Order!

998
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:11,699
I know you're upset.

999
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:15,421
But you're all
dedicated and talented singers.

1000
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:18,213
Marcus will take over
as leader.

1001
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:20,696
- What?!
- Marcus?

1002
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:22,816
- Why are you even doing this?
- Yeah.

1003
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:26,615
Well, I believe these pamphlets
should explain everything.

1004
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:29,456
Each cow or goat
will allow its recipient

1005
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:32,219
independence
and self-sufficiency

1006
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,652
for years to come.

1007
00:55:35,651 --> 00:55:37,855
And that's pretty great,
isn't it?

1008
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:42,019
Shelly, this has
nothing to do with you.

1009
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,014
No, I know it's complicated.

1010
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:46,255
No. I understand.

1011
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,458
Thanks for calling back.

1012
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,611
Told you.

1013
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,494
He'll write you
a reference, but...

1014
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,254
Yeah. He doesn't
want to get involved.

1015
00:55:57,409 --> 00:56:00,891
This isn't gonna work.
I need to find another job.

1016
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:02,730
I can't stay at Meredith's
rent-free.

1017
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:04,210
I know.

1018
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,690
And I can't stay here,

1019
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:07,257
across the street
from my parents.

1020
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:10,170
- I love you. But...
- What the fuck?

1021
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:13,733
- Ethan?
- What the hell is going on?

1022
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:16,977
- What are you doing here?
- Ethan? Like, Ethan Ethan?

1023
00:56:17,129 --> 00:56:20,010
- How did you get in here?
- Your mom gave me the keys.

1024
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,816
She told me
to let myself in,

1025
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:23,496
like you might not
hear the bell.

1026
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:26,168
Look, Ethan, I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

1027
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:29,732
You can ask, but I'm not gonna.
Who is this?

1028
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,775
Ethan, this is David -
David and Paige,

1029
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:33,892
my parents' best friends
from across the street.

1030
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:36,687
Why are you telling
your parents' friend

1031
00:56:36,848 --> 00:56:38,168
that you love him?

1032
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:40,575
The door's open.
What's going on?

1033
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,975
Nina, I need to talk to you.

1034
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:45,211
Can we go somewhere
for, like, five minutes?

1035
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:47,047
Ethan!
I think you should leave.

1036
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:50,055
- Ethan Ethan?
- Yes! Just five minutes!

1037
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,126
She said no, Ethan.

1038
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:54,534
I'm gonna ask you one more time
to get out of here.

1039
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:59,335
And if I don't, Pops,
what are you gonna do about it?

1040
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:00,446
Arggh!

1041
00:57:00,605 --> 00:57:02,013
'Dad!
Hey!

1042
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:03,006
- David!
- Dad!

1043
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,770
Get off me!

1044
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,454
# Your eyes
are like starlight now

1045
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:10,133
# To break this spell

1046
00:57:10,285 --> 00:57:13,166
# I'll take your hat
Your hair looks swell... #

1047
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:15,125
Why don't you go fuck...

1048
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:18,012
- What?
- Nothing.

1049
00:57:18,164 --> 00:57:19,769
Its OK.

1050
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:26,645
# Baby,
it's cold outside. #

1051
00:57:36,564 --> 00:57:40,492
Yes, I cheated on you.
And for that, I am deeply sorry.

1052
00:57:40,644 --> 00:57:43,732
But here's the thing.
I'm a sabotager.

1053
00:57:43,883 --> 00:57:47,484
See, any time
anything good happens to me,

1054
00:57:47,643 --> 00:57:49,487
I...I...I just try
and ruin it, you know,

1055
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:51,203
because I get scared.

1056
00:57:51,363 --> 00:57:55,051
Now, things with us
were really...real.

1057
00:57:55,202 --> 00:57:57,810
But I didn't feel like
I deserved you,

1058
00:57:57,962 --> 00:58:01,563
so I became the sabotager
and, like, destroyed it.

1059
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:03,686
That's great, Ethan.

1060
00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:05,926
But we can't just go on
and pretend like everything's fine

1061
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,610
because you learned
a new term about yourself.

1062
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:11,331
And I don't even think
'sabotager' is a word.

1063
00:58:11,482 --> 00:58:13,369
OK. Please allow me
to finish.

1064
00:58:13,522 --> 00:58:16,566
See, I think
you're a sabotager also.

1065
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:19,765
You totally pushed for us
to get married so you could, like,

1066
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:22,125
prove to your parents
that, you know,

1067
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:23,689
you were
this responsible person.

1068
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:27,682
But simultaneously, you were
just trying to piss them off

1069
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,760
by marrying someone like me.

1070
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,448
I've moved on.

1071
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:33,924
- OK? David and I...
- David and you...

1072
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:38,445
He's your parents' best friend.
For Christ's sakes.

1073
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,721
I mean, what... Are you gonna move
here to New Jersey?

1074
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,128
You hate it here.

1075
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:47,560
We're done.

1076
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:49,847
OK? Go home.

1077
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,527
I only bought
a one-way ticket.

1078
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,568
Well, I'm not giving up
on us, Nina!

1079
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,000
I love you too much
for that!

1080
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,919
What?

1081
00:59:30,397 --> 00:59:31,957
What are you doing
with my bag?

1082
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:34,125
Huh? Nothing.
Just getting it some air.

1083
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:38,518
- Give me my bag.
- No.

1084
00:59:38,677 --> 00:59:40,880
Give me my bag!

1085
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:44,201
- Eat me, dick slut.
- Give me my bag, Vanessa!

1086
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:45,839
No, Nina!

1087
00:59:45,996 --> 00:59:47,916
- No!
- Give me my bag!

1088
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:51,436
- No! No!
- Give it to me!

1089
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:52,917
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Give it!

1090
00:59:53,076 --> 00:59:54,559
Oh!

1091
01:00:29,633 --> 01:00:31,477
Oh, honey. Uh...

1092
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:33,314
Honey?

1093
01:00:33,473 --> 01:00:35,393
I'm sorry, Dad.

1094
01:00:35,553 --> 01:00:37,353
Uh...

1095
01:00:42,912 --> 01:00:45,073
Oh...

1096
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,876
Uh, you know, leave it be.
It's a...it's a badge of honour.

1097
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:02,472
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1098
01:01:02,632 --> 01:01:04,476
There's aloe on the pad
to prevent scarring.

1099
01:01:04,631 --> 01:01:06,115
OK. Um...

1100
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:11,640
You know, I'm good.
I'm, uh...I'm good.

1101
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,998
I'm so sorry about
all this horrible...

1102
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:18,918
...stuff.

1103
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:21,719
I'm just...

1104
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,915
Yeah.

1105
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,878
You know,
my parents were kinda weird.

1106
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,834
That's why I'm, um...

1107
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,794
Sometimes it's really hard
to say everything you want to.

1108
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:42,509
You know...

1109
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:48,397
Your father, he loves you.

1110
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:52,589
Just don't let that
get confused

1111
01:01:52,748 --> 01:01:54,996
with everything
that's happening.

1112
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,511
Life.

1113
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:01,988
Ooph!

1114
01:02:02,148 --> 01:02:03,676
Stuff.

1115
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,948
...Pasquerella, this is Greg
from Barnyard International.

1116
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:11,516
I'm wondering
if I could interest you

1117
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:13,108
in sponsoring a goat.

1118
01:02:13,268 --> 01:02:14,631
Funding for Barnyard International...

1119
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:18,747
Well, thank you very much,
Mr lngber, and, uh...I...

1120
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:21,907
...and I'm sure the people
of Komanesk, Ukraine,

1121
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:24,270
who will be receiving the chickens,
thank you as well.

1122
01:02:24,426 --> 01:02:27,995
- Merry Christmas. 'Bye.
- Great job, Paige.

1123
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:31,394
You're a natural.

1124
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:33,346
Thank you.

1125
01:02:34,906 --> 01:02:36,706
It'll be a great Christmas.

1126
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,473
Oh, fuck!

1127
01:03:02,984 --> 01:03:05,429
- Are you out of your mind?
- What? I'm not on his lawn.

1128
01:03:05,584 --> 01:03:07,308
I'm in the street.
The street's public property.

1129
01:03:07,464 --> 01:03:09,428
- I told you to go home.
- Yeah.

1130
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:11,264
And I totally bought
a return ticket.

1131
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:13,028
But guess what.
I'm not using it.

1132
01:03:13,184 --> 01:03:15,552
I'm not leaving until
you give me another chance.

1133
01:03:15,703 --> 01:03:18,104
Nina, I'm not, which is why
I ripped up that ticket,

1134
01:03:18,264 --> 01:03:19,584
in my mind.

1135
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:21,663
'Cause it's an e-ticket.

1136
01:03:21,824 --> 01:03:26,504
Look... I've moved on.
I'm with someone else now.

1137
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:28,866
You need to get over me.

1138
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,823
Yeah, see,
that's, like, the whole thing!

1139
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:33,231
I don't want
to get over you!

1140
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:37,507
Nina! Please!

1141
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:42,390
# Those streetlights
start to fade away

1142
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:48,870
# I see the quiet on you
when you're sleeping

1143
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:53,026
# Probably dreaming day

1144
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,181
# We had the perfect... #

1145
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:02,382
Hey.

1146
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,549
Hi.

1147
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,668
Thanks.

1148
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:11,101
I'm glad you stopped.

1149
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,660
I've been playing
a lot of ultimate.

1150
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,341
I'm going to play some.

1151
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,060
That's great.

1152
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:28,423
I miss you, Terry.

1153
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:36,739
You might want to
find Vanessa.

1154
01:04:36,899 --> 01:04:38,262
Why? What happened?

1155
01:04:38,419 --> 01:04:41,059
You should probably
let her tell you.

1156
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:43,227
Harry, cut the shit.
What happened?

1157
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:54,981
Hey.

1158
01:05:03,057 --> 01:05:04,781
This is a mess.

1159
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:07,781
Uh-huh.

1160
01:05:11,177 --> 01:05:12,660
Look.

1161
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,504
If you want me to end this,
I will.

1162
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:20,976
I'm serious.

1163
01:05:21,137 --> 01:05:24,301
I know it may not
seem like it lately, but...

1164
01:05:24,456 --> 01:05:28,144
...you are the most important thing
in the world to me.

1165
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:36,023
I don't know.

1166
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:40,543
I mean, then what happens?

1167
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,218
You know...

1168
01:05:48,935 --> 01:05:50,582
I don't know.

1169
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:07,341
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful

1170
01:06:07,494 --> 01:06:10,821
# But the fire
is so delightful

1171
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:14,061
# And since we've
no place to go

1172
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:17,574
# Let it snow,
let it snow, let it snow

1173
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:20,734
# Man, it doesn't show
signs of stopping... #

1174
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,737
What are you doing, Ethan?

1175
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:27,500
# The lights are turned
way down low... #

1176
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:29,453
Paige, I want you
to stop avoiding me.

1177
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:32,219
Terry and I are spending
Christmas Eve with you.

1178
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:34,172
This tradition is continuing.

1179
01:06:34,332 --> 01:06:36,972
So get your ass over here
or I'll get really mad.

1180
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:38,736
OK?

1181
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:40,496
I love you. 'Bye.

1182
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,779
How was that? Too forceful?

1183
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:47,216
# Oh, the fire
is slowly dying

1184
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,575
# And, my dear,
we're still goodbye-mg..- #

1185
01:06:49,731 --> 01:06:50,571
Oh, shit.

1186
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:53,491
# But as long
as you love me so

1187
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:56,651
# Let it snow,
let it snow

1188
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,298
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- # Let it snow. #

1189
01:06:59,451 --> 01:07:01,251
Yeah. Same, uh...
same to you.

1190
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:02,937
David!

1191
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,338
Hello? Anyone home?

1192
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,690
- Hey!
- Hi.

1193
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,774
- Toby.
- Nina. What's going on?

1194
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:14,337
- Oh.
- Oh...

1195
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,573
I really missed you.
Did you get my postcards?

1196
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,770
- Uh... No.
- No? That's so funny.

1197
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:20,413
I sent 'em to your...
your mom's house.

1198
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,413
- Is everyone already over here?
- Call that guy...

1199
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:25,089
- Hey, Toby. You're back.
- Hey.

1200
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,617
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

1201
01:07:27,768 --> 01:07:29,416
Merry Christmas.

1202
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:33,656
What's with
that guy outside?

1203
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,572
How the hell could you not
tell me Mom and Dad split up?

1204
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:40,648
- How could nobody tell me?
- What could you do?

1205
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:42,652
You were in China.
How was that, by the way?

1206
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:44,335
Just get your ass
over here.

1207
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:46,648
You're not leaving me
alone with them.

1208
01:07:46,807 --> 01:07:48,575
Look, I can't, OK?
I'm at work.

1209
01:07:48,727 --> 01:07:51,127
And where the hell is Mom'?

1210
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:52,815
Merry Christmas.

1211
01:07:57,527 --> 01:08:00,288
'Bye.
Say hi to your family.

1212
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:09,491
Putting aside the enormous

1213
01:08:09,646 --> 01:08:11,414
and nauseating age difference
between you two,

1214
01:08:11,566 --> 01:08:13,246
you do realise
that I've kissed her twice?

1215
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:16,090
No, once.
We never kissed on Thanksgiving.

1216
01:08:16,246 --> 01:08:17,806
Oh, well,
everything is fine, then.

1217
01:08:17,965 --> 01:08:19,929
Toby, come on. Uh, look.
I know you're upset.

1218
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:21,406
- But try to understand.
- Understand what?

1219
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:23,006
That I am the first son
in history

1220
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,605
to be cock-blocked
by his father?

1221
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,206
Oh, good.
I haven't missed anything.

1222
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:28,613
Toby. Toby!

1223
01:08:39,604 --> 01:08:41,088
Excuse me.

1224
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,932
Merry Christmas.

1225
01:08:44,084 --> 01:08:46,452
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

1226
01:08:46,604 --> 01:08:49,844
My ex-girlfriend
is inside that house there.

1227
01:08:50,003 --> 01:08:52,491
I'm trying to win her back.

1228
01:08:52,643 --> 01:08:56,407
You must love her very much
to be standing out here like this.

1229
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:58,124
I do.

1230
01:08:58,283 --> 01:09:01,371
She's got this new boyfriend,
and he lives here, but...

1231
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:05,207
She should
really be with me.

1232
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:09,010
You're Ethan, right?

1233
01:09:10,202 --> 01:09:11,927
Yeah.

1234
01:09:13,163 --> 01:09:17,091
My husband is the new boyfriend
of your ex-girlfriend.

1235
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,682
# Joy to the world

1236
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:23,489
# The Lord is come

1237
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:27,166
- # Let earth receive her king
- # Joy to the world

1238
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:30,561
# Let every heart
prepare him room

1239
01:09:30,722 --> 01:09:32,925
- # And heaven and nature sing
- # Nature sing

1240
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:34,728
I And heaven and nature sing!
- # Nature sing!

1241
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:38,362
I And heaven and heaven
and nature sing

1242
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:39,929
I Joy to the earth

1243
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,044
# The Saviour reigns

1244
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:45,408
# Let men
their songs employ... I

1245
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,284
Ethan...

1246
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:49,961
Would you step aside
for a moment, please?

1247
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,128
Sure.

1248
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,444
Oh, Cathy,
I think Paige is here.

1249
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,640
Oh, thank God.
I knew she'd come.

1250
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:03,883
What is she doing?

1251
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,046
Merry Christmas, Paige.

1252
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:09,759
It's about to be.

1253
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:15,003
# Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening?

1254
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:18,247
# In the lane,
snow is glistening... #

1255
01:10:18,398 --> 01:10:20,079
- My God!
- No! Oh!

1256
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:23,086
# A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight

1257
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:26,207
# Walking
in a winter wonderland

1258
01:10:26,358 --> 01:10:27,962
# Gone away... #

1259
01:10:28,118 --> 01:10:29,438
What the hell
is she doing?

1260
01:10:30,438 --> 01:10:31,921
No!

1261
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:34,401
No, no, no!

1262
01:10:36,437 --> 01:10:37,638
Holy shit!

1263
01:10:37,797 --> 01:10:41,441
# Walking
in a winter wonderland

1264
01:10:41,597 --> 01:10:45,045
# In the meadow,
we can build a snowman... #

1265
01:10:46,237 --> 01:10:48,365
- Terry, do something!
- Oh!

1266
01:10:51,276 --> 01:10:53,120
Paige, for God's sake,
what are you doing?

1267
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:54,565
Hello, David.

1268
01:10:56,036 --> 01:10:58,436
Oh, my God!

1269
01:10:58,596 --> 01:11:01,161
- David!
- Go left!

1270
01:11:01,316 --> 01:11:03,083
- David, run!
- Whoa!

1271
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:06,400
- Mom, stop!
- Paige, stop it!

1272
01:11:06,556 --> 01:11:09,360
- Stay still, you!
- Paige!

1273
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,319
- Oh!
- The globe! No!

1274
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:13,916
Oh, Terry.

1275
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:15,919
- Globey!
- Paige, for God's sake!

1276
01:11:16,075 --> 01:11:18,159
Run, David!
Careful, David!

1277
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:21,119
David! Get in the house!
Get in the house!

1278
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:22,999
Get back in the house!

1279
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,077
Ah!

1280
01:11:54,913 --> 01:11:56,953
Sorry about the noise, Robert!

1281
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:00,080
- Merry Christmas, Marion!
- Paige?

1282
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,640
Merry Christmas, dear.
Are you alright?

1283
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:04,640
Aren't you gonna come over
to our house for a bit of dinner?

1284
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:06,516
Thank you for the invitation,
but it's Christmas Eve,

1285
01:12:06,672 --> 01:12:08,516
and I want to spend it
with my children.

1286
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,080
But I made
your favourite duck!

1287
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:11,552
I made the duck
with the peaches.

1288
01:12:11,712 --> 01:12:13,599
I don't think
it's a good idea...

1289
01:12:13,752 --> 01:12:15,836
Are you out of your mind?
What is wrong with you?

1290
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:18,032
You have got
some serious problems.

1291
01:12:18,191 --> 01:12:19,991
- I'm not the only one.
- Jesus!

1292
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:23,239
Oh, Toby. You're back.

1293
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:25,835
Oh, you came home
for Christmas. Mmm.

1294
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:27,595
Hi, Mom.
I told you I'd be back.

1295
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:30,151
I know. I know.
Thank you, honey. Thank you.

1296
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:34,119
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

1297
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:37,718
- Hi.
- Hello.

1298
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,751
- What happened here?
- Nothing. It's fine.

1299
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:43,355
Paige, do you think
maybe you should...

1300
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:45,354
Just a moment, please? OK?

1301
01:12:45,509 --> 01:12:48,030
Toby. How was China?

1302
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:53,557
It was really great. Yeah.
I...brought you a present.

1303
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:58,073
You did? Thank you, honey.
Can I have it'?

1304
01:12:58,228 --> 01:13:00,836
- Yeah, OK.
- Paige.

1305
01:13:00,988 --> 01:13:04,916
David. Not now, OK?
Let's just enjoy this.

1306
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:07,589
Come on. Let's sit.

1307
01:13:09,948 --> 01:13:12,436
I actually brought everyone
presents, since, uh, you know,

1308
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,349
nobody bothered to tell me
what the fuck was going on.

1309
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:17,427
Here.

1310
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:19,992
Cathy.

1311
01:13:23,907 --> 01:13:26,547
Holy night...

1312
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:28,432
Dad. Nina.

1313
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:31,267
Mom.

1314
01:13:31,427 --> 01:13:32,910
Freak.

1315
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:46,787
Thank you, Toby.

1316
01:13:46,946 --> 01:13:48,954
So nice, Toby.

1317
01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:50,753
Thank you.

1318
01:13:50,905 --> 01:13:53,949
Thank you, honey.
You're very thoughtful.

1319
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:57,313
Well, you're welcome.
Merry Christmas.

1320
01:13:57,465 --> 01:13:59,745
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1321
01:13:59,906 --> 01:14:01,313
Merry Christmas.

1322
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:03,352
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1323
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:09,272
Um...

1324
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:12,829
I'd like to say a few words.

1325
01:14:15,504 --> 01:14:17,304
When I was
a junior counsellor at camp,

1326
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:18,948
my favourite camper
made me a...

1327
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:20,305
Terry.

1328
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:21,948
...a candle shaped like
a Star of David.

1329
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:25,552
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course. Of course.

1330
01:14:31,783 --> 01:14:33,747
All of you are...

1331
01:14:36,663 --> 01:14:39,271
...the closest people
in my life.

1332
01:14:41,863 --> 01:14:46,511
And normally, we'd now be eating
some of Paige's butter cookies

1333
01:14:46,663 --> 01:14:49,030
and, uh...

1334
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:52,110
...drinking Terry's eggnog,

1335
01:14:52,262 --> 01:14:54,902
which you brought over
in the ceramic elf bowl.

1336
01:14:56,502 --> 01:14:59,263
And it's easy to say that
we can just go back to that.

1337
01:15:00,902 --> 01:15:02,669
But there's no going back.

1338
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,861
For either one of us.

1339
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:14,509
No. There's not.

1340
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:20,505
Oh, honey.

1341
01:15:20,661 --> 01:15:23,148
Oh.

1342
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,747
I have something
I'd like to say.

1343
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,744
Nina, honey, I don't think
this is a good time.

1344
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:34,979
I know, but...

1345
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:42,347
Paige.

1346
01:15:45,019 --> 01:15:46,339
I'm sorry.

1347
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:48,986
Jesus, Paige!

1348
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:55,866
Some day, I might actually
thank you for all of this.

1349
01:16:21,537 --> 01:16:23,141
You OK?

1350
01:16:23,297 --> 01:16:24,857
Yeah.

1351
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:34,616
Maybe we should
just get outta here.

1352
01:16:36,815 --> 01:16:38,223
I'm off till New Year's.

1353
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:40,340
I've got three weeks
of vacation time.

1354
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:44,097
We can just go to Mexico
or something.

1355
01:16:45,815 --> 01:16:48,019
We could go tomorrow.

1356
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:53,743
Just go online,
book tickets.

1357
01:17:01,014 --> 01:17:02,859
Then what happens?

1358
01:17:07,214 --> 01:17:09,342
I'm serious, David.
Then what?

1359
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:17,058
I don't know.

1360
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,260
- Did I ruin your life?
- No.

1361
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:34,216
No, that is
the last thing you did.

1362
01:17:37,932 --> 01:17:39,613
I'm sorry.

1363
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:50,735
You are so amazing.

1364
01:17:50,891 --> 01:17:52,659
So beautiful.

1365
01:17:55,372 --> 01:17:58,819
And you are gonna be
even more amazing.

1366
01:18:02,851 --> 01:18:04,815
Well, we'll see.

1367
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:25,298
# But you are my star

1368
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:32,410
# Nina, Nina
Nina, Nina

1369
01:18:32,569 --> 01:18:36,213
# I'm sorry
I cheated on you

1370
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:39,773
# I won't do it again... #

1371
01:18:39,929 --> 01:18:42,057
Hey.

1372
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:10,287
On the day
after Christmas, Henry said,

1373
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:12,607
"Sometimes you have to
burn down your house

1374
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:14,414
"in order to see the moon."

1375
01:19:14,566 --> 01:19:18,374
Another Asian saying,
but this time I knew what he meant.

1376
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:21,813
I think Nina
would understand it too.

1377
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,966
She broke up with everyone
that night.

1378
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:28,530
She said she wanted to try
being alone for once.

1379
01:19:31,525 --> 01:19:35,169
As for me, I really didn't
have a plan or anything, but...

1380
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:38,686
...I'd saved just enough to afford
my own place in the city.

1381
01:19:38,845 --> 01:19:43,253
And let me stress,
just enough.

1382
01:19:47,805 --> 01:19:49,605
My dad was pretty mopey
for a while

1383
01:19:49,764 --> 01:19:52,448
but also fairly awesome
in his misery.

1384
01:19:52,604 --> 01:19:55,889
He even helped me
furnish my new apartment,

1385
01:19:56,044 --> 01:19:58,892
with stuff from Huffman Koos.

1386
01:20:00,603 --> 01:20:01,924
- You think?
- Yeah.

1387
01:20:02,084 --> 01:20:03,404
Terry and Cathy
were thrilled

1388
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:05,168
that things were over
with my dad and Nina.

1389
01:20:07,483 --> 01:20:10,571
But not nearly as thrilled
as they were

1390
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,371
with Terry's latest gadget.

1391
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:13,843
Ooh!

1392
01:20:14,003 --> 01:20:15,771
- I'm gonna switch gears.
- Terry!

1393
01:20:15,923 --> 01:20:18,487
- I'm gonna switch gears.
- Terry! Ooh!

1394
01:20:18,643 --> 01:20:21,763
My mother expanded
her humanitarian efforts

1395
01:20:21,922 --> 01:20:23,330
with Barnyard International.

1396
01:20:23,483 --> 01:20:25,250
I think she finally realised

1397
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:28,283
that she had gifts to offer
beyond Christmas.

1398
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:34,963
I hear Nina travelled
around Europe for a while

1399
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:38,362
and eventually got a job
at a fancy restaurant in Rome.

1400
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:42,482
This year, her parents are going to
visit her for Thanksgiving.

1401
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,248
I'm not saying
what happened last Christmas

1402
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,484
happened solely
because of Nina.

1403
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,288
I'm saying maybe what happened
needed to happen,

1404
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,764
even for me.

1405
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,044
- Ah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1406
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,087
My dad came into the city
the other day

1407
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,040
to celebrate my new job.

1408
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,720
He told me he offered the house
to my mom but...

1409
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,363
...she didn't want it.

1410
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,240
He thought about selling
but decided to hold onto it

1411
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:18,882
for when Toby and I
come visit.

1412
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:21,679
He's still
figuring things out.

1413
01:21:21,839 --> 01:21:25,286
But, luckily, he has
his best friend to help with that.

1414
01:22:45,754 --> 01:22:49,201
# I saw you, I found you

1415
01:22:49,354 --> 01:22:52,681
# I watched you grow

1416
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:55,681
# Slowly but surely

1417
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:59,914
# We ebb and we ﬂow

1418
01:23:00,073 --> 01:23:03,401
# I felt a change

1419
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,957
# Deep in my bones

1420
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:11,837
# Something new

1421
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:14,033
# Has grown

1422
01:23:19,632 --> 01:23:22,959
# I was inside waiting

1423
01:23:23,112 --> 01:23:26,559
# Eyes open wide

1424
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:32,396
# I felt the ground beneath me wake

1425
01:23:33,831 --> 01:23:37,236
# I felt a change

1426
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:40,839
# Deep in my bones

1427
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:46,555
# Something new

1428
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:48,794
# Has grown

1429
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:04,749
# Up in your room

1430
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:09,274
# Was a great silent storm

1431
01:24:09,429 --> 01:24:10,673
# Clouds have cleared

1432
01:24:10,829 --> 01:24:15,313
# The air was sweet and warm. #

1433
01:24:18,313 --> 01:24:22,313
