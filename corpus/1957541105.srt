00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,916
Mohammed Rezwan: ISLANDS
ARE GETTING SMALLER.

2
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,875
THE RIVERS ARE GETTING BIGGER.

3
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,998
Glenn Baker: IN BANGLADESH,
ASK ABOUT A PROBLEM,

4
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:18,998
AND THEY'RE LIKELY TO ANSWER,
"DON'T WORRY, PIECE O' CAKE."

5
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:21,290
"PANIR MOTO SHOHOJ."

6
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,999
"EASY LIKE WATER."

7
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:00,541
Baker: I CAME TO BANGLADESH

8
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:04,833
TO DOCUMENT ITS ADVANCING
STRUGGLE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE,

9
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,998
AND TO SEE HOW ONE
LOCAL INNOVATOR

10
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:07,998
AND HIS FLOATING SCHOOLS

11
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:12,000
EPITOMIZED THE COUNTRY'S
RESILIENT SPIRIT.

12
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,958
WHY DO I CARE ABOUT
THIS LITTLE COUNTRY

13
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,124
THAT, WELL,
MANY CAN'T FIND ON A MAP?

14
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,208
I GREW UP IN SOUTH ASIA.

15
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,874
IN INDIA, THEN PAKISTAN,

16
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,999
WHEN BANGLADESH
WAS EAST PAKISTAN.

17
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:36,083
SO I'VE ALWAYS FELT CONNECTED
TO THIS CORNER OF THE WORLD.

18
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:45,207
THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO
BANGLADESH WAS IN 1971,

19
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:49,791
JUST MONTHS BEFORE ITS
BRUTAL WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.

20
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,750
WE TOOK A FAMILY VACATION.

21
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,998
GROWING UP HERE,
I SAW THE HARDEST-WORKING PEOPLE

22
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,124
I'VE EVER KNOWN--

23
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,332
AND THE MOST HOPEFUL.

24
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,416
POOR AND HARD-PRESSED, SURE.

25
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,499
YET PRAGMATIC AND IRREPRESSIBLE.

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,124
IT HURT ME WHEN THEY
WERE CONSTANTLY PORTRAYED

27
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,999
IN WESTERN MEDIA AS "VICTIMS."

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,998
I ALWAYS FELT
BANGLADESH GOT A BUM RAP

29
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,998
WHEN HENRY KISSINGER
DISMISSED IT

30
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,624
AS "AN INTERNATIONAL
BASKET CASE,"

31
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,082
AND THAT LABEL STUCK.

32
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,708
IT JUST DIDN'T SQUARE WITH
THE PLACE I REMEMBERED.

33
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,374
I WANTED TO PAINT A
DIFFERENT PICTURE.

34
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,958
SO WHEN I HEARD ABOUT
MOHAMMED REZWAN,

35
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,040
A TECH-SAVVY SOCIAL
ENTREPRENEUR,

36
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,998
TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE
OF FLOODING HEAD-ON,

37
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,999
I HAD TO GO SEE FOR MYSELF.

38
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,999
ON THE EIGHT-HOUR DRIVE
TO REZWAN'S PROJECT SITE,

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,625
THE CAR IS BLOCKED
BY AN ELEPHANT.

40
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:03,624
I OFFER IT A 10 TAKA NOTE.

41
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,999
Man: GOOD LUCK, GLENN.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,998
Baker: THE ELEPHANT WILL
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

43
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,374
THE ELEPHANT'S BEEN WELL
TRAINED TO NOT TAKE HANDOUTS

44
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,998
FROM STRANGERS OR
THE GOVERNMENT.

45
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,999
I'VE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY
LESS THAN 24 HOURS

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,749
AND DON'T REALIZE THE BILL
IS WORTH ABOUT 14 CENTS.

47
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,999
Man: THAT'S THE WRONG END.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Baker: FINALLY A
50 DOES THE TRICK.

49
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,792
Rezwan: YEAH,
THE SCHOOL HERE IS UNDER WATER.

50
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,082
Baker: REZWAN TOLD ME
FLOODING HAS ALWAYS BEEN

51
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:12,998
A PART OF LIFE HERE.

52
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:18,583
BUT NOW IT'S BECOME MORE
UNPREDICTABLE AND MORE EXTREME.

53
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,374
Baker: REZWAN GRADUATED FROM

54
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,999
THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS
ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,582
IN THE COUNTRY.

DESIGNING MANSIONS FOR THE RICH.

58
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,999
IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR
THAT REZWAN HAD CHOSEN

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,416
A VERY DIFFERENT PATH.

61
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,998

63
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:32,082
Rezwan: BUT I REALIZED THAT MY
BUILDINGS WILL GO UNDER WATER

64
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,208
IN THE FUTURE.

65
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,417
[MAN SINGING, DRUMS PLAYING]

66
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,165
Baker: AT FIRST,
IT WAS A LONELY ENTERPRISE.

67
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,998
IT TOOK FOUR YEARS BEFORE
HE WAS ABLE TO BUILD

68
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,750
THE FIRST BOAT SCHOOL.

69
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,998
Baker: SEARCHING
FOR CHEAP MATERIALS,

70
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:43,624
REZWAN LOOKED TO THE
PORT CITY OF CHITTAGONG,

71
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,917
WHERE OLD SHIPS GO TO DIE.

72
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,958
HE BOUGHT A HANDFUL OF
SURPLUS LIFEBOAT HULLS

73
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,998
AND BROUGHT THEM HOME.

74
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:59,625
FROM THE WRECKAGE,
HE FOUND NEW LIFE FOR OLD LIFEBOATS.

75
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,999
THE COMMUNITY WAS SKEPTICAL.

76
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:10,040
BUT AS IT AWAKENED
TO THE POTENTIAL,

77
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,083
VOLUNTEERS CAME FORWARD.

78
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:58,833
Baker: THE VILLAGES THAT
HUG THESE RIVERSIDES

79
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,916
ARE COMPLETELY OFF THE GRID.

NEAR THEIR HOMES,

Baker: ON TOP OF ACCESSIBILITY,

86
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,124
I DISCOVER THE BOAT SCHOOLS
OFFER SOMETHING ELSE

87
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,874
THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS DON'T--

88
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,582
COMPUTERS AND
INTERNET CONNECTIONS.

89
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,958
Baker: AFTER EDUCATION,
ONE OF THE BIGGEST NEEDS HERE

90
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,834
IS BASIC MEDICAL CARE.

91
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:31,250
Baker: THIS IS THE FIRST DOCTOR
THIS WOMAN HAS EVER SEEN.

92
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,499
Dr. Saleemul Huq:
HAVING FLOATING SCHOOLS,

93
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,874
AS WELL AS FLOATING CLINICS,
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE,

94
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,374
AND IT DEMONSTRATES FOR
THE WORLD THAT BANGLADESHIS

95
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,666
HAVE A CULTURE OF
LIVING WITH NATURE,

96
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:45,708
AND BEING ABLE TO ADAPT TO
WHATEVER NATURE THROWS AT THEM.

97

HUQ IS PASSIONATELY CONCERNED

98
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,998
BY HOW GLOBAL WARMING
IS HITTING HIS COUNTRY.

99
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:54,583
BEFORE MY TRIP,

100
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:58,290
I CAME ACROSS HIS OPTIMISTIC
VIEWS ON BANGLADESH

101
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,165
AND KNEW I HAD TO MEET HIM.

102
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,541
AFTER TEACHING IN
LONDON FOR TEN YEARS,

103
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,290
HE'S COME HOME TO CREATE
THE FIRST RESEARCH CENTER

104
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,749
FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION
IN A "LIVING LABORATORY."

105
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,708
Huq: BANGLADESH HAS A
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

106
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,998
WHEN IT COMES TO ADAPTING
TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

107
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:19,998

IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTRY

109
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,124
HAS A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE IN FACING

110
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,709
AND HAS A LOT OF
COPING CAPACITY.

111
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,207
Baker: DR. HUQ TAKES VISITING
SCIENTISTS INTO THE FIELD

112
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:35,625
TO SEE HOW THE LAND IS CHANGING,
AND HOW PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING.

113
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:40,624
Huq: WHAT I'M HOPING TO DO IS
TO LEVERAGE THE CURRENT VIEW

114
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,499
OF BANGLADESH AS THE
ICONIC VULNERABLE COUNTRY,

115
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,749
TO TRANSFORM THAT INTO THE
ICONIC ADAPTIVE COUNTRY.

116
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,833
Baker: DR. HUQ'S UPBEAT
TAKE ON THE COUNTRY

117
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,499
PROMPTED ME TO DIG DEEPER.

118
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,499
I LEARNED ABOUT "THE BANGLADESHI
FAMILY PLANNING MIRACLE."

119
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,374
HOW, SINCE INDEPENDENCE,
THE BIRTHRATE HAS BEEN REDUCED

120
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:05,874
FROM ALMOST SEVEN CHILDREN PER
WOMAN TO JUST OVER TWO TODAY.

121
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:10,998
YET ONE THING YOU CAN'T
HELP NOTICE HERE IS PEOPLE--

122
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,000

129
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,791
EDUCATING GIRLS IS A
KEY STEP IN DEVELOPMENT.

130
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:44,709
IT DELAYS MARRIAGE AND LEADS
TO MORE USE OF FAMILY PLANNING.

131
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,998
IT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES

132
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,792

GIRLS HERE OFTEN DON'T GET
A CHANCE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

141
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,457
BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS,

142
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,541

IN A TOWN SEVEN HOURS AWAY.

150
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,250

TOOK RACEL FOR TREATMENT,

160

THE HOSPITAL WAS
NEAR THE AIRPORT.

161

RUPA BEGAN TO IMAGINE
THE POSSIBILITIES.

162
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,582
Baker: REZWAN CALLED HIS PROJECT
"SHIDHULAI," OR "SELF-RELIANCE."

163
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,998
THREE YEARS AFTER HE LAUNCHED
THE FIRST BOAT SCHOOL,

164

INVITED TO COMPETE

00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,332
TO GIVE HIM THE ASHDEN TRUST
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AWARD.

172
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:32,749
WITH THOSE PRIZES IN HAND,
HIS PROJECT STARTED TO TAKE OFF.

173
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,998
BACK HOME,
THE LEADING ENGLISH DAILY

174
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:38,083
RAN A STORY PRAISING HIS WORK.

175
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,999
Baker: LIKE A LOT OF
POOR, YOUNG COUNTRIES,

176
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,874
BANGLADESH HAS ONLY LIMITED
EXPERIENCE WITH DEMOCRACY.

177
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,458
I FOUND OUT ON

178
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,540
TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL'S
CORRUPTION INDEX,

179
00:18:55,541 --> 00:19:00,582
IT RANKS 120th OUT
OF 182 COUNTRIES,

180
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,207
TIED WITH KAZAKHSTAN AND IRAN.

181
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,708
IT'S A PLACE WHERE
FACTS CAN BE ELUSIVE

182
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:12,458
AND NEWS COVERAGE CAN SOMETIMES
REFLECT SPECIAL INTERESTS.

183
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:17,540
WHEN HIS PROJECT WON A MAJOR
AWARD FROM THE GATES FOUNDATION,

184
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,750
IT RAISED HIS PROFILE AGAIN.

185
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,082
Baker: SUDDENLY,
THE TONE OF SOME ARTICLES CHANGED.

186
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:39,457
ONE CLAIMED INVESTIGATORS COULD
NOW ONLY FIND THREE BOATS.

187
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,082
THEY MUST NOT HAVE
LOOKED VERY HARD.

188
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:45,458
WE SAW MORE THAN 20 ON
TWO DIFFERENT RIVERS.

189
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:22,332
Baker: NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX
POLITICS OF THE NON-PROFIT WORLD

190
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,541
COMES WITH THE JOB.

191
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,998
[CHILDREN RECITING LESSONS]

192
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,457
BUT I WAS COMING TO
REALIZE THAT AT HEART,

193
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,457
REZWAN IS A SOCIAL
DESIGN VISIONARY,

194
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:39,916
CREATING A BLUEPRINT
FOR SHARED SURVIVAL.

195
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,040
Baker: TO SERVE THE GROWING
DEMAND FOR LEARNING,

196
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:02,082
REZWAN HAS DESIGNED
DOUBLE-DECKER BOATS.

197
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:06,750
ON ONE LEVEL,
KIDS ATTEND CLASS IN THE ROUND.

198
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,250
UP ABOVE...

199
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,833
Baker: SPEAKING
OF ANIMAL FRIENDS,

200
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,998
WE SAW BIG BATS
COME OUT AT DUSK.

201
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:42,998
ONCE NIGHT FALLS,
IT GETS REALLY DARK HERE.

202
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:43,998
OUTSIDE THE CITIES,

203
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:48,332
FOUR OUT OF FIVE BANGLADESHIS
DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY,

204
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,998
LEADING, IN MANY WAYS,
A PRE-MODERN LIFE.

205
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:58,540
WITHOUT IT,
PEOPLE USUALLY STAY HOME AT NIGHT.

206
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,833
WE SAW HOW THE TRAINING BOATS,

207
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:05,375
EQUIPPED WITH BATTERY-POWERED
PROJECTORS, ARE CHANGING THAT.

208
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,249
Baker: AND SO REZWAN'S COME
UP WITH ANOTHER FIRST HERE--

209
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,916
FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT.

210
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:55,874
Baker: VILLAGERS PAY A SMALL
FEE TO TRADE IN THE LANTERNS

211
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,999
FOR ONES WITH A FULL CHARGE.

212
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,999
STUDYING BY THE LIGHT
OF A SOLAR LAMP,

213
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,708
GOLAPY KHATUN IS THE
FIRST GIRL IN HER FAMILY

214
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:13,999
WITH A SHOT AT HIGHER EDUCATION.

215
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,332
Baker: WITH A TOTAL
OF 18 SCHOOL BOATS,

216
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:32,207
REZWAN'S PROJECT CAN ONLY OFFER
CLASSES TO ELEMENTARY GRADES.

217
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,165
BUT REZWAN TOLD ME HE FOUND
SUCH A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE

218
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:39,749
AMONG OLDER STUDENTS,
HE CAME UP WITH ANOTHER INNOVATION--

219
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,999
FLOATING LIBRARIES.

220
00:23:56,999 --> 00:24:01,709
Baker: SHE STILL HAS TO CONVINCE
HER FATHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

221
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,332
Baker: 17-YEAR-OLD
HASINUR RAHMAN

222
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,041
LIVES ON THE SAME RIVER.

223
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,290
Baker: ON THE BOAT RIDE HOME,

224
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,290
HASINUR SHOWS THAT,
LIKE MANY BANGLADESHIS,

225
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:17,999
HE'S ALL TOO AWARE OF THE HUMAN
HAND IN THE CHANGING CLIMATE.

226
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,082
Baker: REZWAN TOOK US ON A TOUR

227
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:06,999
TO SHOW US JUST HOW
PERVASIVE THE PROBLEMS ARE.

228
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,915
Baker: FUELED BY
MELTING GLACIERS

229
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,998
UPSTREAM IN THE HIMALAYAS,

230
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:30,998
THE JAMUNA RIVER RUNS DOWN
THE SPINE OF BANGLADESH.

231
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:34,207
IT DRAGS ALONG TONS OF SILT.

232
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:39,457
AS THE SEDIMENT BUILDS UP,
IT MAKES THE RIVER MORE SHALLOW.

233
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:43,709
AND THAT MAKES THE RIVER EXPAND.

234
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:49,625
IN SOME PLACES,
IT'S NOW TEN MILES WIDE.

235
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,958
Baker: THE GOVERNMENT IS
THROWING BAGS OF GRAVEL

236
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,875
AGAINST THE CRUMBLING SHORE.

237
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:39,916
Baker: ON REZWAN'S ADVICE,
THAT'S WHERE WE HEADED NEXT.

238
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,998
WE TOOK THE OVERNIGHT FERRY
PAST GHOSTLY BRICK FACTORIES

239
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:52,998
THAT GENERATE THE
BUILDING BLOCKS

240
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:56,999
OF THE SPRAWLING
MEGACITY OF DHAKA.

241
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,290
WHEN WE SET UP OUR CAMERA,

242
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:19,208
WE WERE SURROUNDED BY A HOST
OF PEOPLE EAGER TO TALK.

243
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,998
Baker: TOFAZZAL HOSSAIN
USED TO GROW RICE HERE.

244
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,582
BUT THE POWER OF
THE MEGHNA RIVER

245
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:47,959
HAS ERODED THOUSANDS
OF ACRES OF FARMLAND.

246
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,915
Baker: REZWAN DIRECTED US TO THE
SOUTHERNMOST PART OF THE COUNTRY

247
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:18,916
TO SEE THE FULL EXTENT
OF CLIMATE DEVASTATION.

248
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,915
THIS IS AN AREA
TEETERING ON THE BRINK,

249
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:28,999
WHERE HIS FLOATING SCHOOLS WOULD
PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS SERVICE.

250
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,999
Baker: RESIDENTS HAVE COVERED
LEVEES MADE OF MUD WITH THATCH

251
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,750
IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO
KEEP THEM FROM WASHING AWAY.

252
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,998
Baker: THIS PART ALREADY HAS.

253
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:08,207
IF AN UPDATED MAP OF
SOUTHERN BANGLADESH EXISTED,

254
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,624
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A GRID,

255
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,998
THE LINES ON GRAPH
PAPER BEING THE LAND.

256
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,998
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS NOW UNDERWATER.

257
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,998
IT HAS NEVER RECOVERED
FROM TWO MASSIVE CYCLONES

258
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:23,834
IN 2007 AND 2009.

259
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:34,332
WE TOOK A BOAT TO AN EMBANKMENT
WHERE THE MUD WAS SO SLIPPERY,

260
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,583
A LOCAL MAN HELPED
KEEP ME FROM FALLING.

261
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:20,790
Baker: THOUSANDS NOW
LIVE ON DIRT EMBANKMENTS

262
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:24,625
SURROUNDED BY WATER AND MUD.

263
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,874
Baker: ENCROACHING SALTWATER
IS KILLING THE TREES,

264
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:58,875
RENDERING A SURREAL LANDSCAPE.

265
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,998
Baker: IN THIS AREA,
CALLED THE SUNDARBANS,

266
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:40,499
I DISCOVERED HOW CLIMATE
CHANGE IS ALTERING LIVES

267
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,999
IN UNEXPECTED WAYS.

268
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,374
THE NEARBY MANGROVE
FOREST IS HOME

269
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,998
TO ABOUT 400 ROYAL
BENGAL TIGERS,

270
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:55,624
ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED
SPECIES ON EARTH.

271
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,332
Huq: THERE IS VERY STRONG
EVIDENCE THAT SEA LEVEL RISE

272
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,415
AND SALINITY INTRUSION IS
CHANGING THE ECOSYSTEM.

273
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,415
THE TIGER'S HABITAT
IS SHRINKING,

274
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,958
AND THEREFORE THEY'RE NOW
LOOKING AT ENCROACHING

275
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:09,833
INTO HUMAN HABITATS.

276
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,790
Baker: LIKE EVERYWHERE
IN THIS COUNTRY,

277
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:15,582
THE SURROUNDING AREA
IS DENSELY POPULATED.

278
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:19,915
HERE I SAW BOTH VALIANT
EFFORTS TO ADAPT

279
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:24,083
AND THE LIMITS OF ADAPTATION.

280
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,915
Baker: NOW THE WATERS
ARE OVERFISHED,

281
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,998
FORCING FISHERMEN TO VENTURE
DEEPER INTO THE MANGROVE SWAMP,

282
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:51,499
WHERE THE TIGERS' TURF
IS GOING UNDERWATER, TOO.

283
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,998
SOME TIGERS CROSS THE
RIVER TO LOOK FOR FOOD.

284
00:34:55,999 --> 00:35:00,208
INEVITABLY,
THEY ENCOUNTER PEOPLE.

285
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:11,874
IN THIS AREA,
TIGERS NOW KILL ABOUT 80 PEOPLE A YEAR.

286
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:15,416
A LOT MORE ARE
INJURED IN ATTACKS.

287
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,499
Baker: RASHIDA'S OLDEST
SON, RASINUR,

288
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,833
WAS IN FOURTH GRADE THEN.

289
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:53,125
NOW HE HAS TO FILL HIS
FATHER'S SHOES--AND HIS NET.

290
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:18,124
Baker: I START TO WONDER WHETHER
MUD, BAMBOO,

291
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,999
EVEN FLOATING SCHOOLS,
ARE GOING TO BE ENOUGH

292
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,416
TO HOLD THIS VULNERABLE
COUNTRY TOGETHER.

293
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:57,999
Baker: DHAKA.
THIS IS WHERE THEY COME.

294
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,082
LIKE A MAGNET IN THE
CENTER OF THE COUNTRY,

295
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:05,750
IT PULLS IN PEOPLE WHO
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

296
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:18,834
THE LOCAL PAPER AFFECTIONATELY
CALLS IT "A CHOKING HELL."

297
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:26,082
WE SPEND HOURS
LOCKED IN TRAFFIC.

298
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:31,083
WHEN THE CAR STOPS,
VISITORS ARRIVE.

299
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:45,998
THIS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES
OF THE OLD BANGLADESH.

300
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,791
THIS HASN'T CHANGED.

301
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,291
I CATCH MYSELF WONDERING

302
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:02,791
IF THINGS REALLY ARE
GETTING BETTER HERE.

303
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,999
Atiq Rahman: IT IS A
CLIMATIC DESTABILIZATION

304
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,207
OF CATASTROPHIC AND
IRREVERSIBLE NATURE.

305
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,332
Baker: IN DHAKA,
I TRACK DOWN DR. ATIQ RAHMAN,

306
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,999
WHO WAS A KEY MEMBER OF THE U.N.
CLIMATE PANEL

307
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,415
THAT SHARED THE
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

308
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,582
Rahman: WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLES

309
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:50,999
WHOSE LIVELIHOOD, WHOSE
HABITATION, WHOSE IDENTITY,

310
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,082
WHOSE EXISTENCE IN
THEIR OWN ECOSYSTEM

311
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,749
WILL BE SEVERELY CHALLENGED.

312
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,998
Baker: TOGETHER WITH HIS
COLLEAGUE SALEEM HUQ,

313
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:02,624
THEY'VE BECOME SORT OF
A GOOD COP/BAD COP TEAM

314
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,249
FOR GLOBAL CLIMATE JUSTICE.

315
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,998
Rahman: IT'S AN
ISSUE OF CONSUMPTION

316
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:11,458
WITHOUT RESPECT FOR
THE LIMITS OF NATURE.

317
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,790
Baker: SO MANY HAVE BEEN WASHED
OFF THE SOUTHERN ISLAND OF BHOLA

318
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:43,624
AND COME HERE,
THEY'VE NAMED THIS SLUM BHOLAVILLE,

319
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:47,999
WHERE THEY LIVE ABOVE WATER.

320
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,915
Baker: NOW ABOUT
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE

321
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:16,374
ARE MOVING TO DHAKA EVERY YEAR.

322
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,250
AND THEIR RANKS KEEP SWELLING.

323
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,999
Rahman: HOW MANY PEOPLE
DOES GERMANY HAVE TO TAKE?

324
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,998
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL THE U.S.
HAVE TO TAKE?

325
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:42,834
[PEOPLE CHANTING]

326
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,915
Crowd: TAKE ACTION, TAKE ACTION,
AND GET SOME SATISFACTION.

327
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:38,708
OOH, IT'S HOT IN HERE.

328
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:42,915
THERE'S TOO MUCH CARBON
IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

329
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,082
CLIMATE JUSTICE NOW!

330
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,082
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

331
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,874
Baker: WE WENT TO COPENHAGEN TO
SEE BANGLADESH'S CLIMATE STORY

332
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:53,999
PLAY OUT ON A GLOBAL STAGE.

333
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:02,332
WHILE DR. HUQ CAME TO HELP
CRAFT AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT

334
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,998
TO LIMIT CARBON EMISSIONS,

335
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,374
DR. RAHMAN LED A
BANGLADESHI DELEGATION

336
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:10,207
TRYING TO DRUM UP
SUPPORT FOR ADAPTATION.

337
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,998
Rahman: WE HAVE TO ADAPT,
AND ADAPT BIG TIME.

338
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:15,290
THERE IS NO QUESTION OF CHOICE.

339
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,083
Baker: THE QUESTION BECAME,

340
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:20,207
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD RICH,
POLLUTING COUNTRIES PROVIDE

341
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,040
TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES ADAPT?

342
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,374
Yvo De Boer: THE
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SAYING

343
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,082
THEY WANT A NEW
FINANCIAL MECHANISM...

344
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,082
Rahman: IT'S ALL ABOUT
"WE HAVE NO MONEY."

345
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,749
THAT IS TRUE,
NOBODY HAS EXCESS MONEY.

346
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,999
BUT WHEN THE RICH SUFFER,

347
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,207
WHICH WAS THE FINANCIAL
CRISIS IN THE U.S.,

348
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:39,499
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
APPEARED FROM SOMEWHERE.

349
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,124
WHEN THE POOR SUFFER,
THERE'S NO MONEY APPEARING.

350
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,708
THERE IS A SERIOUS ECONOMIC

351
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:48,040
AND ECOLOGICAL
JUSTICE ISSUE IN THIS.

352
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,540
Man: TIME IS UP.

353
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:52,666
WE NEED A REAL DEAL.

354
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,249
Huq: I WENT THERE
WITH HIGH HOPES,

355
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,125
AND I CAME OUT
TOTALLY SHATTERED.

356
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,665
WE HAD A GATHERING OF
THE WORLD'S LEADERS.

357
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,998
THEY COULD HAVE MADE A
DECISION IF THEY WANTED.

358
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:10,998
THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO THINK
OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF

359
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,540
"WHAT'S BEST FOR MY COUNTRY?"

360
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:14,998
Rahman: IT WILL NOT
BE ONLY BANGLADESH

361
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:16,790
THAT WILL GO UNDERWATER.

362
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,124
NEW YORK WILL GO UNDERWATER.

363
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,749
LONDON WILL GO UNDERWATER.

364
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,999
TOKYO WILL GO UNDERWATER.

365
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,998
Huq: CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT
ABOUT WHAT ONE COUNTRY GAINS

366
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:28,332
FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY.

367
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:32,457
IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE
LEADERS OF THIS GENERATION

368
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,374
ARE GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND

369
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:37,041
FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND
THEIR GRANDCHILDREN.

370
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,998
Baker: FLOATING SCHOOLS,

371
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,915
CLINICS,

372
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,874
CINEMAS,

373
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:59,082
LIBRARIES.

374
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:04,040
THE NEXT STEP IN REZWAN'S PLAN
IS TO HELP HIS COMMUNITY SURVIVE

375
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:07,666
WHEN EXTREME FLOODING HITS.

376
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:43,833
Baker: HE'S DEVELOPING A SENSOR

377
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,415
TO BE PLACED AT KEY
POINTS ALONG THE RIVER

378
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,332
THAT WILL SEND SIGNALS
TO THE SHELTERS

379
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:50,998
WHEN THE WATER REACHES
A CRITICAL LEVEL.

380
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:56,208
THEY IN TURN WILL SEND TEXT
WARNINGS TO VILLAGES DOWNSTREAM.

381
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:15,998
Baker: THE WORLD BANK
HAS AGAIN INVITED REZWAN

382
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,666
TO COMPETE FOR FUNDING.

383
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:30,834
Announcement: WELCOME TO WASHINGTON
DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

384
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:43,915
Woman: OHH, WHO IS THIS?

385
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,040
Rezwan: HOW ARE YOU?
YOU ARE HERE?

386
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,290
Woman: GOOD! YEAH.

387
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,833
OH, COOL. YEAH.

388
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:48,999
I HEARD FROM SOME BANGLADESHIS,

389
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,998
THEY WANT TO DO,
THEY WANT TO DO MAYA NUT IN BANGLADESH.

390
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,332
Baker: BEFORE HE CAN
SET UP HIS BOOTH,

391
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,415
REZWAN RUNS INTO A
FELLOW COMPETITOR

392
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,415
WHO HE KNOWS FROM
OTHER COMPETITIONS.

393
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,998
Rezwan: SO YOU ARE
HERE FOR THE MAYA NUT?

394
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:00,833
Woman: YEAH! YOU WANT TO SEE?

395
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:01,416
Rezwan: OKAY, LET ME...

396
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,040
Woman: WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU JUST GOT HERE?

397
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,499
Rezwan: YEAH, JUST GOT HERE.
LET ME, YOU KNOW...

398
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,457
Woman: COOL.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

399
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,166
CONGRATULATIONS.

400
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:09,833
Baker: BUT QUICKLY
THE CONVERSATION

401
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:11,415
GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS.

402
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:12,998
Woman: WE GOT SOME GRANTS.

403
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:13,625
Rezwan: OKAY.

404
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,207
Woman: WE'VE GOTTEN A
LOT OF PRIVATE DONATIONS.

405
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:18,665
BUT MAYBE WE'LL ALL WIN
TODAY, TOMORROW.

406
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,290
ALRIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

407
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,457
Rezwan: OKAY, NICE MEETING YOU.

408
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:22,540
Woman: WE'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

409
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,458
Rezwan: OKAY.

410
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,166
Woman: HOW MUCH WOULD THIS COST?

411
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:52,874
Baker: AL JAZEERA
HAS GOTTEN WIND

412
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,998
THAT REZWAN IS IN WASHINGTON,

413
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:59,999
AND INVITES HIM, AND
ME, TO APPEAR ON AIR.

414
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,998
Riz Khan: TODAY'S SHOW WE ASK,

415
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:06,833
HOW DOES A DEVELOPING
COUNTRY LIKE BANGLADESH

416
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:08,998
ADAPT TO THE THREAT
OF CLIMATE CHANGE?

417
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:10,958
JOINING ME IS A MAN
WHO'S NOT ONLY ADAPTING

418
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,082
TO THE GROWING THREAT
OF CLIMATE CHANGE,

419
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:15,040
BUT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES
FOR MANY BANGLADESHIS,

420
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:15,874
ESPECIALLY WOMEN.

421
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:16,998
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC THINGS
WILL REALLY KEEP MOVING

422
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:19,249
WITH THIS PROJECT,
YOU CAN REALLY GROW IT ON A HUGE SCALE?

423
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,207
Rezwan: YEAH, IT IS POSSIBLE.

424
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,874
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY
OTHER OPTION IN BANGLADESH.

425
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,207
IF SOUTHERN PARTS OF
BANGLADESH GOES UNDERWATER,

426
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,998
THEN PEOPLE HAVE
ONLY ONE OPTION--

427
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,834
THEY HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO LIVE ON WATER.

428
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,291
[APPLAUSE]

429
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,916
Man: THE NEXT WINNER...

430
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,998
PROJECT NUMBER 1641.

431
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,290
"SAMOANS TURN TO
TRADITIONAL HOUSING

432
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,708
AS A SANCTUARY
FROM CLIMATE RISK."

433
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:07,333
[APPLAUSE]

434
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:15,998
THE NEXT WINNER,
PROJECT NUMBER 4561.

435
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:17,040
[CHEERING]

436
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:22,166
Man: AN AWARD TO
CULTIVATE MAYA NUT TREES.

437
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:34,624
Man: AND NOW TO ANNOUNCE
THE FINAL WINNER.

438
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,290
PROJECT NUMBER 1358,

439
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:40,958
"ADAPTING NATIVE ANDEAN
CROPS FOR FOOD SECURITY

440
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:44,165
IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE."

441
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,083
[APPLAUSE]

442
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:09,834
[LAUGHS]

443
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,665
Huq: BANGLADESH
OVER ITS EXISTENCE

444
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,998
HAS TEETERED ON THE BRINK
OF FALLING OFF A CLIFF,

445
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:33,998
BUT NEVER SEEMS TO FALL OFF.

446
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:36,998
SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
INHERENT IN THE PEOPLE

447
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:39,040
THAT PROVIDES A
RESILIENCE AND A CHARACTER

448
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:42,790
THAT THEY SOMEHOW
CAN FACE ADVERSITY.

449
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:44,415
NOT THAT THEY AREN'T
AFFECTED BY IT,

450
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:47,040
THEY ARE QUITE BADLY
AFFECTED, BUT NEVERTHELESS,

451
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,457
THEY ARE ABLE TO
PICK THEMSELVES UP,

452
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,999
DUST THEMSELVES
OFF, AND CARRY ON.

453
00:51:56,999 --> 00:52:01,915
Baker: AFTER THE LONG TRIP
HOME, REZWAN GETS BACK TO WORK.

454
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:07,999
HE'S GOT NEW IDEAS AND STAFF
EAGER TO BRING THEM TO LIFE.

455
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:32,415
Baker: RUPA AND RUMA
ARE IN FOURTH GRADE NOW.

456
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,874
GOLAPY'S FATHER HAS DECIDED
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING

457
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:38,874
TO HAVE A POLICE
OFFICER IN THE FAMILY.

458
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,457
HASINUR IS PLANNING
A COMPUTING EMPIRE,

459
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:46,250
AND MAY JUST TURN
INTO "REZWAN 2.0."

460
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:10,457
Baker: AS I'M LEAVING,
IT OCCURS TO ME

461
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,290
THAT BANGLADESH POSSESSES
EXACTLY THE TOUGHNESS

462
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,540
AND RESILIENCE REQUIRED

463
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:19,708
FOR THE PLANET TO SURVIVE
THE CHANGES AHEAD.

464
00:53:19,709 --> 00:53:23,915
SLAMMED BY THE INDUSTRIAL
WORLD'S CARBON POLLUTION,

465
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,998
BATTERED BY WEATHER EXTREMES,

466
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:32,207
YET HERE IT IS,
A CAULDRON OF IDEAS AND ENERGY.

467
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:37,124
EVEN THE TONE OF MEDIA
STORIES IS STARTING TO CHANGE.

468
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:42,165
FARMERS ARE GROWING NEW
STRAINS OF SALT-RESISTANT RICE.

469
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:47,874
ONE POSED THE QUESTION,
"BANGLADESH--ECO SYMBOL?"

470
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,790
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EVEN
WENT SO FAR AS TO WRITE,

471
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:55,458
"BANGLADESH,
'BASKET CASE' NO MORE."

472
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,708
Huq: BANGLADESH IS VERY
MUCH AT THE FOREFRONT

473
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:02,833
OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS.

474
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:05,249
SO EVEN DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES LIKE THE U.S.

475
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:05,999
CAN COME TO BANGLADESH

476
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,499
TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH
DISASTERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

477
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,040
Baker: THE ANSWERS TO THIS
CENTURY'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS

478
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,999
MAY WELL COME FROM
THE GLOBAL SOUTH.

479
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,998
AND AS FOR REZWAN?

480
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:23,998
THE RENOWNED
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

481
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,915
RECENTLY FEATURED HIS
BOAT SCHOOLS IN AN EXHIBIT

482
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:32,290
ON SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE
IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.

483
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:38,041
AS THE NEW YORK TIMES PUT
IT, "RESCUED BY DESIGN."

484
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:45,166
ON HIS PROJECT BOATS,
HOPE CONTINUES TO FLOAT.
