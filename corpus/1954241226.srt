1
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:42,143
Once upon a time.
In the far, far north.

2
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:45,460
The Snow Queen appeared
and changed life on Earth

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,190
as we know it.

4
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:49,898
The World became such a cold place,

5
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,458
that people would
hide inside their houses.

6
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:56,296
But there were those who
would stand up to the Queen.

7
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,640
They were called Wizards.

8
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:02,990
Then one night, the evil Queen
sent a north wind rushing into town,

9
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:05,682
to freeze the last Wizard left on earth.

10
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:07,842
Master Vegard.

11
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:16,660
Gidee up!
Go!

12
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:45,127
Master Vegard made magic mirrors

13
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:48,632
that were capable of
reflecting one's true self,

14
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,226
which no mask could disguise.

15
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,598
These mirrors were the
Snow Queen's biggest fear.

16
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,663
Una.  Quickly.
Hide the children.

17
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:23,530
Una, hurry.

18
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,165
Gerda, hide.

19
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,196
Do not be afraid, my love.

20
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,500
We shall live forever
in our children's hearts.

21
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,569
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

22
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:19,461
THE SNOW QUEEN

23
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:02,052
Master Vegard,
we meet again.

24
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,713
I am so pleased to see you.

25
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,252
And thrill you.

26
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,126
And look at your wife.

27
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:15,557
A bit stiff, don't you think?

28
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:21,463
Oh, enough with all the fun.

29
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:25,604
The time for eternal frost has come.

30
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,207
Mirror...

31
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:31,111
The Earth is growing cold.

32
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:35,478
Your power is getting
stronger, your Majesty.

33
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,324
People's hearts are waning,

34
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:41,960
and yet ....

35
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,491
I'm listening ...

36
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:49,271
A child lives among the people.

37
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:52,766
The Master's blood
runs through its veins.

38
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:56,336
Its young heart beats vigorously.

39
00:04:56,514 --> 00:05:01,716
A living heir to Master Vegard
could stop the forces of the North.

40
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,190
Good morning, Mrs Van Berry.

41
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:08,217
Kai . Ohh.
Hello my boy.

42
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,229
Come in.

43
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,960
Get warm.
Make yourself at home.

44
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,428
It must be freezing outside.

45
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:20,874
As usual of course.

46
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,804
Here he is.  As promised.
Look!

47
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:29,318
I see you shaved a few pounds off
my face and not just a couple of years.

48
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:32,621
Truth be told.  I've never been
slender, not even in my youth.

49
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:35,579
- You don't you like it?
- Don't be silly, boy.

50
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:39,320
I absolutely love it, my dear.
You know what?

51
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,458
I have got a little surprise
of my own, for you too.

52
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,337
It must be around here.

53
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:02,323
Is this real paint?
And brushes?

54
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,449
Take it.

55
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:07,053
A truly passionate artist like you

56
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:09,923
must have all the
right tools to work with.

57
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:14,697
My husband wanted to be an artist,
but he became a pirate instead.

58
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:18,139
It's a pity his ship sank before
he even learned how to draw.

59
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,074
But be careful my boy.

60
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:23,271
The last thing I would
ever want to happen,

61
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,842
is for you to get in trouble.

62
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,879
- Thank you, Mrs Van Berry.
- Goodbye, dear.

63
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,265
Sorry.

64
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:07,891
Troll.

65
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:16,781
Listen very carefully, Troll.

66
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:19,641
Go search among the people.

67
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:23,148
I want you to find
Master Vegard's heir.

68
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,239
Do you understand?

69
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,777
Did I say you could leave?

70
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:32,522
One more nod ...

71
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,891
and the castle will have a long
nose ice statue in its collection.

72
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:39,655
Now, listen carefully.

73
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:43,565
Take this vial of
North Wind with you, Troll.

74
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,607
It will shine brightly
near the Master's heir.

75
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:49,268
So pay very close attention.

76
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,814
You must wait for the North Star.

77
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,810
Then break the vial.

78
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:59,045
And the North Wind will
bring you back to the castle.

79
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:04,257
Thank you.
Thank you, your Majesty.

80
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,787
I'm on it.  Piece of cake.
Be back tomorrow. Take it.

81
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:27,883
St. Peters Kids Shelter.

82
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:43,439
March!  All children to
the workshop at once.

83
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:45,501
Everybody and you orphans.
No exceptions.

84
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,706
Luta! Luta, where are you?

85
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,314
Naughty weasel.

86
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,981
Did you leave your room again?

87
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:58,019
If the house master finds out,
he'll make a scorns out of you.

88
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:36,490
Obedience and hard work
are expected at all times.

89
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,471
There is no mummies or daddies
holding your hand around here.

90
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:42,605
This is an orphanage.

91
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,138
And you're expected to be so
sufficient and follow simple rules.

92
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,115
You never speak
unless you're spoken to.

93
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,880
And there is absolutely
no laughter allowed.

94
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:56,555
Laughter is a detriment
to our work discipline.

95
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:01,122
This is the third time you're
late this week, young lady.

96
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:04,690
I'm sorry, sir.  It won't
happen again, I promise.

97
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,204
Now, it is also prohibited
to engage in to activities

98
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,770
such as drawing, painting, singing,

99
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:16,879
or any other useless
artistic expression of that sort.

100
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,782
And last but not least...

101
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,789
No pets.

102
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:24,314
Mr House Master?

103
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,504
May I be excused sir?
For just a minute.

104
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,417
I promise that's all it will take.

105
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,287
One minute.

106
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,323
Hi, sorry.
Don't mean to bother you.

107
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,850
But I think my weasel
might be in your basket.

108
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,615
Is it a white, cute thing
with really nice fluffy fur?

109
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,516
Yeah.  But she loves
to wander around.

110
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,068
She's crazy about chimneys.

111
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,405
She's always getting into trouble.
Little brat.

112
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,866
Actually, she's right behind you.

113
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:17,664
Oh, Luta.

114
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,441
She's such a little pet.

115
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:23,583
I'm Gerda. Hmm.
Don't think I've seen you here before.

116
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,681
Are you new?

117
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,485
Piece of cake.

118
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,978
I'll be back tomorrow with the kid.

119
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,522
- I work here in the .....
- What?

120
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:39,492
I found him.
It took me 13 years, but I did it.

121
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:43,826
What's this?  Is it paint?
Are you a painter?

122
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:46,101
Can I see?

123
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:50,673
No!   I'm busy.
Some other time.

124
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:52,368
Okay?

125
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:56,912
I would say that's a
pretty long minute, isn't it?

126
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:02,723
If you think you can
wander around the house

127
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,790
when you're supposed to be working.

128
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:08,458
Boy, do I  have
some bad news for you.

129
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,829
Mr House Master, sir?

130
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:13,032
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

131
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:16,659
I asked her to help me,
clean the boiler.

132
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:20,670
Huh, unable to handle our
own chores now, are we?

133
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:24,443
You can go, but don't think
you're free from punishment.

134
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:28,045
And you are not to leave the workshop
until you assume 50 more mittens.

135
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,608
Do you understand me?

136
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,775
- But ...
- 100!

137
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,920
As for you .....

138
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:47,099
Every single boy and girl in
our house, without exception

139
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,213
is gainfully employed.

140
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,775
But instead of looking after
the boilers, what do you do?

141
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,850
You paint?

142
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:59,531
But paintings bring joy
and warmth to this cold world.

143
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,878
Stop!

144
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:05,275
Nonsense.
But on the other hand ...

145
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:07,825
No!

146
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:14,744
You were right, Kai.
They do bring warmth to the world.

147
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:18,920
And they are most
pleasing to the eye as well.

148
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:31,206
That was absolutely
barbaric, in my opinion.

149
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,306
Who's there?

150
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:35,271
Over here.
Little lower.

151
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:36,878
Yah.  Hi.

152
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:40,081
Unbelievable!
A talking weasel.

153
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:43,849
My friend, you're surely not going
to remain a stoker all your life.

154
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,888
A gifted boy like you.

155
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,959
Gifted?
You mean me?

156
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,121
Yeah, you.

157
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:52,563
I know a thing or two about art.

158
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,692
And this my lad, I have
to say, is excellent work.

159
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,095
Oh, right.
No masterpiece, but ...

160
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,767
Not bad for a boy
from a place like this.

161
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:06,478
So where did you get the gift from?
Must be in your genes.

162
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,942
- So, who's your parents?
- They died.

163
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,254
A long time ago.
I was a baby.

164
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:15,516
That's right.  A baby.
You know what?

165
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:18,929
I think what you have to do is grow.

166
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,965
Develop as an artist, that is.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,764
But not here, in this dump, of course.

168
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:25,204
I can arrange
a place for you to go to.

169
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,099
Where there are people just like you.

170
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,073
Where you'll become a master.

171
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:32,881
All you got to do is tell me you're
ready, boy and we can leave tonight.

172
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,278
Once the North Star comes out.
What do you say?

173
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,481
I...

174
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,693
I need to think about it.

175
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,598
No, no, no ...
I'm not rushing you.

176
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,930
Please, take your time.
But not too long.

177
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,766
North Star. Tonight.
Got it?

178
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,891
He is really nice.
Don't you think?

179
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,566
You know, when
I think of my brother ...

180
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,993
I imagined that he'd be like him.

181
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,808
Did you see?
He tried to protect me.

182
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,933
I should probably thank him.

183
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:29,448
It is the right thing to do.
He's so nice.

184
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,383
Finally, 100!

185
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,237
Lights out everyone!

186
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,674
Time for bed.

187
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:37,365
Quiet!

188
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,541
Alright kid. You're all packed?

189
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:55,081
Well, actually I don't have much.

190
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,422
This is the only thing I'm taking.

191
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:59,539
Yeah. Sure ...
Whatever.

192
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:02,223
Hold on a second.  I just
gonna check something out here.

193
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:05,993
What's going on?

194
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,738
Wait!
Are you an only child?

195
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,471
I heard I had a sister.

196
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,904
But...
I don't remember her name.

197
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,182
I don't really remember her at all.

198
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:20,116
Unbelievable.

199
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:23,254
You mean now I got to start looking
for Master Vegard's daughter?

200
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,557
Did you know my father?

201
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:25,723
Master Vegard?

202
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,327
Yeah, of course.
But I mean, not personally.

203
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:29,493
But, let's just say ...

204
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:31,597
We had a mutual acquaintance.

205
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:35,995
How about we just agree to say, you know,
your sister died along with parents, ok?

206
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:37,636
No, I'm alive.

207
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,064
Gerda?

208
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:40,570
Kai?

209
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:42,969
Hey.

210
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:51,779
A troll?

211
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,129
Oh no you don't.

212
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:00,495
I almost froze to
death looking for you.

213
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:14,714
Let her go!

214
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,810
What do you mean?
She's the one holding on to me!

215
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,252
Let go of me, girl!

216
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:22,057
I can't let go!
We're too far from the ground.

217
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,124
Hold on, Gerda.
Don't let go.

218
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,327
I won't.
I'm not going to lose you again.

219
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:30,199
Too late.  I'm the one who
found him first.  He's mine.

220
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,134
What?   What the heck are
you doing, you white rabbit?

221
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:36,034
Just get out of my delicate nose!

222
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,208
Kai!

223
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:43,703
Gerda!

224
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,477
Kai!

225
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:59,189
Well, that's it!
Get ready to meet an angry troll!

226
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,169
You'd better tell me
where you sent Kai.

227
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:05,139
Unless you want my Luta
on that ugly face of yours.

228
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,750
Aw, what are you doing?
You hit me right in the face.

229
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,547
Luta!  Get him!

230
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,784
You've ruined everything.

231
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:21,651
Hey!  Where did you get that thing?

232
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,856
Are you talking about this?

233
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:26,390
A mirror.

234
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,532
That's Master Vegard's magic mirror.

235
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:32,672
Yeah.
That thing in your hand.

236
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:33,662
Where the you get it?

237
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:37,298
It's always been with me.
For as long as I can remember.

238
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,850
So she's Master Vegard's kid too?

239
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,380
Oh boy, I'm in trouble.

240
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:50,689
Okay.
Where you send Kai?

241
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:53,359
And if you don't tell me,
I'll smash you with this.

242
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:56,377
It wasn't me.
It's the North Wind.

243
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:58,124
And it's taken him
to the Snow Queen.

244
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:01,569
What does she want with him?

245
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:03,970
He's an artist.
You're kidding, right?

246
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,493
You should know by now
the Queen hates all artists.

247
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,946
- Sculptors, musicians ...
- Now, listen carefully.

248
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:10,381
You're going to
help me get Kai back.

249
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,715
- Or else what?
- Luta.

250
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,853
Get off.
Get it off me.

251
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,821
Help! Help!

252
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,353
I will ... just get it off!

253
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,719
I will take you to Kai.

254
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:26,666
I said I'll help.

255
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:29,202
I'm Gerda.
And this is Luta.

256
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:30,202
Orm.

257
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:31,033
Time to move.

258
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:32,986
Time to move?

259
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:35,609
And how exactly are we
supposed to climb down there?

260
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,474
Orm.
You don't want to make us angry.

261
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,148
I'll move when I feel like it.

262
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,183
I thought I was going to fall ...

263
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:46,545
Orm, watch out!

264
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:03,533
Orm.

265
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:12,487
You know, you should thank me
because I just saved your life.

266
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:13,649
So shut up.

267
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:18,656
Wow. It's so beautiful.
So many flowers.

268
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,108
I'm going to go into the house
and snatch me something to eat.

269
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,741
You are coming with me.

270
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,378
And you, keep an eye out.

271
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,145
We're not going to steal.

272
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,115
What we going to do is
politely ask for some food.

273
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,517
Look at all these flowers.

274
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,411
I'm sure they're nice people.

275
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,619
I bet you, they're generous too.

276
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,728
Oh Gerda.

277
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,353
You really don't know
much about people, do you?

278
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,926
Who's there?

279
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:58,038
Alright. Let's get the
old woman a heart attack.

280
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:00,032
I'll go see what I can find.

281
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,140
Aahh my roses.

282
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:08,719
This bush could have been
remade about ... 3 bouquets.

283
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:10,895
But there are only five flowers.

284
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,798
Who are you, nincompoop?

285
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,572
Ahh.
Just a case of 2 and 1 of 1.

286
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:19,687
Now, let's see. That adds up
to 35 dollars, plus the gate.

287
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:21,279
No.

288
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,511
And the window.

289
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,196
Ahh, I'll give you 2
dollars for that furry ...

290
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:28,137
Her name is Luta.

291
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:30,674
Err ma'am,
I'm sorry to bother you,

292
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:33,229
but I was wondering,
do you have any food?

293
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,747
What is that?  How peculiar.
What's that smell?

294
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:40,310
That's the scent of roses.

295
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,521
I'd better be going.

296
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:51,696
Well, well.
This is interesting.

297
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:53,959
This could fetch 10 dollars each.

298
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:55,463
Hold it right there.

299
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:58,242
Truth is, I can't bear
to see you go hungry

300
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,904
in this freezing weather, my dear.
Come in.

301
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,981
I'll give you some
hot tea and biscuits.

302
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:05,649
But I must go
see the Snow Queen.

303
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:08,452
Believe me, girl.
You don't want to see her.

304
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:42,089
No need to bow
so low for me ... Kai.

305
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:47,765
Who would have thought a troll
could make it happen after all?

306
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,040
No doubt, just fool's luck.

307
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:53,900
How were your travels
coming here, my dear?

308
00:25:54,606 --> 00:25:57,338
You seem to have made it alright.

309
00:25:58,662 --> 00:26:01,494
Most arrive as a block of ice.

310
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:04,363
You have a strong heart, Kai.

311
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:09,970
Good.  Follow me.

312
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:30,625
My sweet girl, just tell
me, how did you do it?

313
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,527
Is it a spell?
Or some kind of potion?

314
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:35,597
- Or is it magic?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

315
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,189
But I don't understand.

316
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:41,833
Well look at that.
Pretty clever for a young girl.

317
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:46,105
Okay, fair enough. Fine.
Let's make a deal.

318
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:48,040
What wager shall we start with?

319
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:52,182
How about two dollars?
No, no, no.  Four dollars.

320
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,342
That would be a fair price.

321
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:58,384
Excuse me, but...
I do not know your name.

322
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,854
Sweet child, you can call
me grandma or auntie.

323
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:04,025
Or I can be your mother.

324
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,457
I've never really want it.

325
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,796
We should be sisters.
Or better yet, best friends.

326
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:11,662
You're kind of scaring me.

327
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:16,498
Me? Tell me how you did it.
I've been trying for ten days,

328
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:19,603
but I've never been able to
make them sell as anything.

329
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:23,699
Well, except for the new one,
of course.  I use it as fertilizer.

330
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:26,015
I don't know.
They just smell.

331
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,845
Come now, sweet sister.

332
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:30,750
Just imagine the kind of
money we can make together

333
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,844
if we were to combine our efforts.

334
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,256
You mean, that's what you do?
You sell flowers?

335
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,845
Joy, my dear.

336
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,721
I sell joy.

337
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:41,393
At a bargain price, of course.

338
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:44,232
A bargain?
Five dollars for a flower ...

339
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:45,729
that doesn't even smell?

340
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:50,836
It's just business, you nini.
Don't worry about it.

341
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:52,791
I shall teach you everything.

342
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,708
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

343
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:57,106
You can't go!

344
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,271
I mean, I just can't let you go

345
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:03,349
without making sure you have
another cup of my delicious tea.

346
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,816
Well, I know you'll enjoy it.

347
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,956
Okay. Just one cup then.

348
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:12,031
Yes, yes. Just one, that's all.

349
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,269
Stop right there, you little rat!

350
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:32,671
Sneaking on trying to get
my food for yourself, huh?

351
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:35,163
Well, I ought to teach
you a lesson for that.

352
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:36,837
What?

353
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:37,867
Oh yeah?

354
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:42,517
Really? That's bad.

355
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,821
Come on.  Follow me.

356
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,269
Yes, yes. Just one.

357
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,972
Is she really that stupid?

358
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:03,411
I'll have her in my greenhouse
keeping me company forever.

359
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:06,712
My little sister will
keep me whirling in money.

360
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:23,500
A potion for forgetting.
Very clever.

361
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:25,668
She sure is a nasty old witch.

362
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,847
Oh, hold on a second.

363
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:36,280
A troll!

364
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,656
Yeah, hi.
Come on, Gerda.  Time to go.

365
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,764
- Orm?
-  Yeah, sorry. The potion.

366
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,004
Speaking of, this lovely lady here was
going to give you a forgetting potion.

367
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,131
What are you saying?

368
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:50,904
Such lies.  How dare you?

369
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,371
Is that true?
You wanted to poison me?

370
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:56,146
Let's go, Luta.

371
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:59,687
You are not going
anywhere, unless I say so.

372
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:01,154
Ivy!

373
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,416
You better let the girl go.

374
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:39,033
What's wrong with you?
They're getting away.

375
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:41,273
Capture that girl at once!

376
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,606
Get her!

377
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,771
Sweetheart, you don't!

378
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,703
What?

379
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,563
Come to the mirror, Kai.

380
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:07,377
What's happening?
I'm so cold.

381
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:12,360
There are two heirs.
We need them both.

382
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:14,728
What do you mean
two heirs?

383
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,533
What's the meaning of this?

384
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,705
Do you have a brother or a sister?

385
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,934
You had better tell me the truth.

386
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:26,409
No, it's just me.
I have no siblings.

387
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:30,745
Really?   Is the little
boy trying to play hero?

388
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:34,718
No, no... I'm not.
I promise.

389
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,859
I will ask you again.

390
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:41,767
Are there any other children
in your family besides you?

391
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:42,865
No. No.

392
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:47,338
You had your chance.

393
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:49,741
You choose to lie.

394
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:53,973
You cannot lie to me.
Not with the frost taking over.

395
00:32:54,985 --> 00:33:00,123
As it invades every inch of you,
I can hear the voice from your heart.

396
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,855
And it will tell me her name.

397
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:13,469
Is that her?
Is that your sister?

398
00:33:15,812 --> 00:33:17,037
Gerda.

399
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,115
So your sister's name is Gerda?

400
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:24,790
Look at all these flowers.
They must be really nice people.

401
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:26,323
I'd bet they're generous too.

402
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:29,493
Alright. Okay I was wrong.
Sorry.

403
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:33,565
And yes, thank you for
helping me there at the gate, too.

404
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:34,761
I appreciate it.

405
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:38,172
Yeah, not a big thing.

406
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:41,881
And by the way, I am much
more dangerous than I appear to be.

407
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:43,748
Sometimes I turn into this ...

408
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:46,450
gigantic, scary polar bear.

409
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,754
I can't help it.
It just happens.

410
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:50,856
How many times has that happened?

411
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:54,088
What?
You mean, full transformation?

412
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,499
Have this.   No lunch of
course, but it's something.

413
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,660
But I got nothing for you.

414
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,345
That doesn't matter.
You can have it.

415
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:10,907
Don't want it.

416
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,913
Here you go, Luta.

417
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:15,923
Hey, hey.
Buzz off you little rat!

418
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,820
I don't know what you're thinking ...

419
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:23,097
But I'm warning you.
I'm unpredictable.

420
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,936
You said you were hungry,
so I got us some ginger bread.

421
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:28,496
Where to now?

422
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:32,276
Trust me. I know these roads

423
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:35,913
like the back of my hand.
Piece of cake.

424
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:01,684
Orm, are you lost?
Just admit it.

425
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:05,349
Mean what. Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

426
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:09,121
The entrance to Amanas Cave
is somewhere around here.

427
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:12,599
We're walking around in circles.
See, they're our footprints.

428
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:14,934
Please.
There are people everywhere.

429
00:35:17,939 --> 00:35:19,802
I don't see any one.

430
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,177
My bad, huh?
You want to be left behind?

431
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,225
Orm, are you okay?

432
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,392
Are you hurt?
Let me have a look.

433
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:44,130
I'm fine.
Leave me alone.

434
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:51,438
Here they are!
The beautiful Amanas Caves.

435
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,050
The birth place of the Trolls.

436
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,487
Did Trolls live here?

437
00:35:58,427 --> 00:35:59,986
They're long gone.

438
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,999
These caves have been empty
ever since the Snow Queen

439
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:06,971
spread her cold ambition
and ruled the world.

440
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:10,039
Her existence alone

441
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,513
influenced two great kings
from the Troll brotherhood

442
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:15,976
making them turn against each other.

443
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:21,182
Their desire for power was so
great that it consumed their hearts

444
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:24,954
and led to a merciless war
like never seen before.

445
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,890
Leaving no winners to speak of.

446
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:33,707
It is said that the
Trolls' suffering souls are

447
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:37,334
still in the deep waters of Lake Gao.

448
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,309
Did they all disappear?

449
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,417
No.  One survived.

450
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,946
He was ... stronger.

451
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,956
He was braver.
He was quicker.

452
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,364
He was smarter.  And also...

453
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:57,767
Very handsome!

454
00:36:58,072 --> 00:37:01,141
But wait a minute.
Where is that mighty Troll?

455
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:06,381
Orm!
Are you okay?

456
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:09,361
Yeah.  Never mind.
Keep going.  I'll catch up.

457
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,586
- Orm, are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

458
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:14,923
Just ... don't look into the lake.

459
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,330
That girl playing her
sweet little tricks on me.

460
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:25,136
She thinks she can be
more clever than me.

461
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:29,034
Thinking ... she'll find my soft spot.

462
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,582
Well, I have to admit. That
gingerbread was kind a nice.

463
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,616
Nothing has ever
tasted sweeter in my life.

464
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:42,624
Okay.  She shared a gingerbread,
and I've got to take her to her friend.

465
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,163
Huh, who am I kidding?
I'm leaning to the Snow Queen.

466
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:51,773
If it wasn't for that nasty
ice queen, life would be easier.

467
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,003
Troll!

468
00:37:57,816 --> 00:38:01,055
Hello my queen.
I love this surprise visits.

469
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,823
Where is Gerda, Troll?

470
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:06,524
Oh, she'd be around.
Got to keep it down though.

471
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,095
Not that I'm afraid of her, but you
know how children are these days.

472
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:10,088
They think they're invincible.

473
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,002
But can they really beat a troll?
Come on.

474
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:15,432
- You were beaten by a girl?
- But there were two of 'em.

475
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,041
- And they surprised ...
- Shut your mouth and listen.

476
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:21,070
I've been too kind to you.

477
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,950
Why haven't I frozen you yet?

478
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,302
Well, because you're such a nice lady.

479
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,420
- And deep down, you're really ...
- Enough!

480
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,959
Yes, your Majesty.

481
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,918
Your stupidity continues to amaze me.

482
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:37,804
But as usual, every time
I asked you to do something,

483
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:40,001
you proved to be
completely incompetent.

484
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,152
Thank you, my queen.

485
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,142
I need them both.

486
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:47,547
Do you understand
what I am telling you?

487
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:50,776
Or else, I'll ...

488
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:11,023
Stop!

489
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:16,405
What are you thinking? Huh.
What part of ...

490
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,499
"You can't look into the lake"
don't you understand?

491
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:22,407
Listen to me.
We got to cross the bridge.

492
00:39:22,546 --> 00:39:25,538
Now don't look down cos
no ones gonna see you.

493
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,569
Don't look into the lake.

494
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,497
Do not ...

495
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:53,712
No! No!
Don't do it!

496
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,140
Gerda.

497
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:59,115
Gerda.

498
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:02,351
Luta. You better help her.

499
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:04,455
Kill...

500
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,217
Kill .....

501
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:11,587
I've got you, ok.

502
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,997
No one has ever
been able to look away.

503
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,666
Gerda, you overcame
the evil power of Gao.

504
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:26,541
It's okay.
Nothing but an icicle.

505
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:29,510
And another.
And another.

506
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:31,914
Hurry. Move it!

507
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,343
What was that?

508
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:07,688
It looks like a royal hunt.

509
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:11,489
You over there.  Where is
that ferret? Answer the king.

510
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:18,256
Stop shooting at them!

511
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:22,328
You dare shout advice to the king?
My sword!

512
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,428
Attack!

513
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:27,702
Let's try that again.

514
00:41:45,264 --> 00:41:49,567
The unforgiving cold weather
broke Queen Anne's health,

515
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,260
and she soon passed away.

516
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,708
The King was left on his
own with his two children,

517
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:59,608
and there has been no
peace in the castle ever since.

518
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:05,546
The Royal Court declared the king
unfit to perform his parental duties.

519
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:10,521
Thus, he cannot come
within ten paces of his children.

520
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:17,486
And the kingdom has been divided in
half between his Majesty and his heir.

521
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,529
So how are you feeling?

522
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:27,295
I got you!

523
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:32,179
Ooh, what's going on?

524
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:34,846
Oh damn it!

525
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:37,848
- Visitors?
- No. They are my prisoners.

526
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,989
Your prisoners?
We saved you.

527
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,221
Why are you so mean?

528
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:43,156
Because I'm an tyrant and a despot!

529
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:44,636
You can say that again.

530
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:46,504
Time for a trial and execution.

531
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,793
No, I'll just go
straight to the execution.

532
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:50,931
I'll chop the heads off,
and then hang them.

533
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:52,064
One moment, Sire.

534
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:55,401
Allow me to remind you that
by orders of the Royal Court

535
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:59,241
half of what the King owns must
be handed over to his children.

536
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,942
You take my side as the girl.

537
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:02,205
That's more than fair.

538
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:04,571
I don't think so.

539
00:43:04,895 --> 00:43:06,956
We'll divide the girl in half as well.

540
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:09,869
Do you want the
top half or the bottom half?

541
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:13,236
Wait.  Hold on one moment.

542
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,175
Oh dear.
What on earth am I thinking.

543
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:21,652
What is the matter with me?
Have I completely lost my mind?

544
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:25,808
What we need to do, is divide
her vertically not horizontally.

545
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:28,598
That way, each of us
gets an equal half of the girl.

546
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:29,663
And everyone's happy.

547
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:31,368
You're trying to take
advantage of us again.

548
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:32,601
He doesn't care about us.

549
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:34,605
How can you say
I don't care about you?

550
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,276
How about last summer
when you forgot our birthday?

551
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:38,929
That's not true.
I remembered.

552
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:40,549
- Too late.
- How could I tell?

553
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,485
It's always winter these days.

554
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,672
I don't understand
why you argue so much.

555
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:45,848
You're family.

556
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:48,893
A family that fell apart long ago.

557
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:51,687
These two only think about themselves.

558
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:53,100
Have you any idea

559
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:55,104
- how hard it is to run a kingdom.
- No, I don't.

560
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:57,975
Neither do they.  They
even divided this one in half.

561
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,348
I don't think I can help you.
I have to save my brother.

562
00:44:01,383 --> 00:44:03,817
He's in danger and he's
the only family I've got.

563
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:06,153
You see.
She wants to save her brother,

564
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:09,161
but you two, just want to
get rid of your own father.

565
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:10,561
That's not true.

566
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:14,466
I do not need you two.
And I'm going to prove it.

567
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:16,969
I'm going to set fire
to my half of the castle.

568
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:19,171
No, don't burn us first.

569
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,073
Oh Daddy!

570
00:44:35,574 --> 00:44:36,827
- Help us.
- Fire.

571
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:38,871
Daddy please!
Help us.

572
00:44:38,906 --> 00:44:41,673
Coming.
Your daddy will save the you!

573
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,868
You two are the most important
things I have ever had in my life.

574
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:01,737
You always make me work so hard.

575
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:05,743
I only did that so you could grow
up to be a wise and noble king.

576
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:07,110
Like your father.

577
00:45:07,715 --> 00:45:10,186
Don't be afraid, my dear children.

578
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:12,486
Quit the babbling and grab the rope.

579
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:44,502
Gerda, there are no words that
could truly express our gratitude.

580
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:48,568
You had done so much for this family.

581
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:53,809
Please accept this sleigh as
a token of our appreciation.

582
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,152
What about you?

583
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:59,127
Now that we're together
as a family once again,

584
00:45:59,162 --> 00:46:02,097
we don't need
anything else to be happy.

585
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:04,556
Bye!

586
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,390
Good luck!

587
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:09,609
I'm going now. You have a
long journey ahead of you.

588
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:11,746
And be sure to come back and see us.

589
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:14,508
We'll be waiting for you.
Good-bye!

590
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:20,127
Tell me Orm.  Why do you
serve the Snow Queen?

591
00:46:20,162 --> 00:46:22,790
Well, I guess, I didn't
have much of a choice.

592
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:25,428
At the beginning,
I was her assistant.

593
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:27,158
At least, that's what I thought.

594
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:30,367
Then it started looking
more like I was her servant.

595
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:33,158
In the end, I just
ended up being her slave.

596
00:46:33,193 --> 00:46:35,577
That's not right.
She doesn't own you.

597
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,413
Yeah well, I don't
disagree with you there.

598
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:41,685
But I have a feeling
she thinks differently.

599
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:49,024
Stop!

600
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:53,238
Hello, there ma'am.
Where are you going?

601
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:56,342
Sorry, sweetie.
End of the road.

602
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:58,184
Go.  Come on.

603
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:02,520
- Yeah.
- Come on.

604
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,267
Go! Go! Go!

605
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:17,373
Orm, now would be a really
good time to turn into a bear.

606
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:45,787
To the right!

607
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,723
Give it to me!

608
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:51,698
Scram. Give it!

609
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:55,301
Come to rescue.

610
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:56,302
No.

611
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:06,014
That's it. I've had it with you,
you little white rat!

612
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:07,491
Orm!

613
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:10,265
And you keep out of it,
cause this is your fault.

614
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,566
Wanted to see a bear, huh?

615
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,365
A teach your rat some manners!

616
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:18,174
Alright.
No, I'll take that.

617
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:49,520
Keep away from the girl.

618
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,593
Sweetie, come on.

619
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:53,743
You're undermining my
authority with the crew.

620
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:55,601
Authority?
Wake up, mom.

621
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:58,031
One day, I'll fight the
captain and take over.

622
00:48:58,074 --> 00:49:02,743
Uh!  How dare you talk to me like.
You're threatening your own mother?

623
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,416
You raised me with pirates.

624
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:06,519
Did you expect a delicate flower?

625
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:08,754
Come on, who's first?

626
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:10,454
Good girl.

627
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:33,053
So, tell me your name.
What's your name?

628
00:49:33,696 --> 00:49:35,129
Gerda.  I'm searching for...

629
00:49:35,164 --> 00:49:39,340
Gerda?  I like it.
I'm gonna take that name.

630
00:49:39,374 --> 00:49:42,130
- So what's your name again?
- Gerda.

631
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:45,211
Hey, you.  Are you
trying to be clever with me?

632
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,681
I'm Gerda.

633
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:48,653
North Wind, have mercy on us.

634
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:52,586
Sweetie.  Why don't you just tell
Gerda here, your name's Martha?

635
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:55,496
What brings you to
a place like this anyway.

636
00:49:55,531 --> 00:49:58,562
I have to go to the Snow Queen
to rescue Kai, my brother.

637
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:02,052
If she's got him, then
you can forget about him.

638
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:04,536
But how can I just forget about him?

639
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,979
I'll be your sister.
Okay?

640
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,879
No.
I'm sorry.

641
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:12,985
You're not very brave, are you?

642
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,853
I'm brave.  I am.

643
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:17,494
I just cannot waste anymore time.

644
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:20,062
I hate to break it to you.
You're not going anywhere.

645
00:50:20,097 --> 00:50:21,297
You're my prisoner.

646
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:23,289
No!  You don't understand.

647
00:50:24,135 --> 00:50:26,235
You're the one who needs rescuing.

648
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:29,445
Now that you've been
captured by cold hearted pirates.

649
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,639
Pirates?
Here?

650
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:36,820
You mean to tell me that this old bucket
was once a pristine good looking ship?

651
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:37,979
Whatever.

652
00:50:37,987 --> 00:50:40,487
We're going to get tons
of gold, build a new ship

653
00:50:40,488 --> 00:50:42,017
and start pirating again.

654
00:50:42,095 --> 00:50:44,030
But even if you do build a ship,

655
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:45,845
how are you going to set it afloat?

656
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:49,132
Where will you go?
There's no sea anywhere.

657
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:52,725
Since it froze over years ago
because of the Snow Queen.

658
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:03,312
Now!
Who are you and the dog?

659
00:51:03,588 --> 00:51:06,355
Hey!
Lady, I'm not a dog.

660
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:12,595
String up the scoundrel!

661
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,569
Stop please!
Please don't hurt him

662
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,640
He's helping me find Kai.

663
00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:22,414
If you let us both go, he'll
help me defeat the Queen.

664
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,982
And you'll have seas
and oceans once again.

665
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:26,420
Boy, are you naive.

666
00:51:26,622 --> 00:51:29,624
Defeating a queen and
trusting a talking dog?

667
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:32,130
That's discrimination.
I'm a good guy.

668
00:51:32,165 --> 00:51:33,497
Just ask Gerda.

669
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:41,230
Mom.
Why don't you give him a chance?

670
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:43,938
As you wish.

671
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:48,041
I have a hard time believing
the Snow Queen can be defeated.

672
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,341
But this is a good opportunity.

673
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:54,818
Do you think I need these soreless
doubloons, and pieces of eight?

674
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:56,395
All nonsense.

675
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:59,044
All that the sailor's
heart and soul desires

676
00:51:59,045 --> 00:52:01,855
everyday of his life
is oceans to see.

677
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:03,304
The wind that fills the sails

678
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:06,899
and takes the ship to ride
the waves to unknown worlds.

679
00:52:07,244 --> 00:52:09,112
I'm going to give you my reindeer.

680
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:12,339
Sunshine, remember
how hard it was to steal it?

681
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:16,078
That's not smart.   It's the best
reindeer in the entire North region.

682
00:52:17,357 --> 00:52:20,394
You're going to need your
strength to take on the Snow Queen.

683
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:48,996
Well, from what I can see, you
do seem to have some real talent.

684
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:59,805
And now, the time has come for
you to get a little taste of my art, Kai.

685
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,984
Hold on tight!

686
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:34,351
Not that tight.

687
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:38,767
Remember!
The Lapp woman is a shaman.

688
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:41,570
No doubt, she'll know how to
deal with the Snow Queen.

689
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:44,240
Go faster, Ragnar!
Faster than the wind.

690
00:53:55,492 --> 00:53:57,855
Hey! Wait for me!

691
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,494
I can't stop him, Brad.
Take him Brad!

692
00:55:35,727 --> 00:55:39,526
My home is no place for a troll.

693
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:42,887
An old witch.  I didn't
want to go near her anyway.

694
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,135
Good evening.

695
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,174
I sense a mirror.

696
00:55:48,614 --> 00:55:52,340
Mirrors are quite
a rarity these days.

697
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:55,422
When you look into a mirror

698
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:59,228
you believe you're seeing
a perfect image of yourself.

699
00:55:59,263 --> 00:56:02,230
The moment you adjust
the angle even slightly,

700
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:04,364
perspective will change.

701
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:07,971
That mirror reveals
what your eyes cannot see.

702
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:11,110
Hate and fear become exposed.

703
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:15,713
Or perhaps kindness and warmth.

704
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:20,049
An master only creates  a
mirror with great sincerity.

705
00:56:20,354 --> 00:56:24,356
That threatening is bad for
someone with a vengeful heart.

706
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:28,901
That's why the Queen fears
Master Vegard's mirrors.

707
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:31,740
Many years ago,
a girl was born

708
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:34,642
into the family of
a wise Lapp wizard.

709
00:56:34,677 --> 00:56:36,945
Even as a young child

710
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:41,446
she displayed more powers
than any wizards of the North.

711
00:56:41,618 --> 00:56:46,693
Her name was Irma,
and her peers admired her

712
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,452
for her extraordinary gifts.

713
00:56:50,263 --> 00:56:53,836
But those who could not
understand what she was

714
00:56:53,837 --> 00:56:56,367
discriminated against her.

715
00:56:56,806 --> 00:57:00,338
Irma couldn't fit into the real world.

716
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:05,183
Children were cruel and mean
because she was different.

717
00:57:05,218 --> 00:57:07,622
Just a witch ...
... crazy witch.

718
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:09,381
Her gift turned into a curse.

719
00:57:09,457 --> 00:57:14,163
Everyone shunned Irma.
This made her deeply sad.

720
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:17,759
And her sadness turned to
anger, festering in her heart.

721
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:22,275
Then one day, Irma decided
to go into the Amanas caves

722
00:57:22,277 --> 00:57:24,275
and made a wish.

723
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,671
Let all those who
dislike me turn into ice.

724
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,877
Hatred weakened her heart.

725
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,890
And the cold took
hold of Irma's soul

726
00:57:35,894 --> 00:57:37,228
forever.

727
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:53,880
What's all this about?
I just want to save my brother.

728
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:57,681
Evil cannot be
destroyed with greater evil.

729
00:57:58,023 --> 00:58:02,561
Believing that you are not alone in
this world, can help you conquer fear.

730
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,165
And sometimes, your
most powerful weapon ...

731
00:58:06,169 --> 00:58:08,465
is a mere embrace.

732
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:10,834
But how am I supposed to do that?

733
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:15,332
The mirror.  You must
seek the answer there.

734
00:58:15,547 --> 00:58:18,139
Listen carefully, Gerda.

735
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:21,920
Take this boat
and let the cold wind ...

736
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:23,957
take you to the Snow Queen.

737
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:39,600
My legend is always
bigger than the truth,

738
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:42,750
because it also reveals that
such evil can be defeated ...

739
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,515
can be defeated.

740
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:47,417
Then do what you have to do.

741
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:51,221
And in return, you
shall get what you desire.

742
00:58:52,132 --> 00:58:54,895
Each decides for themselves.

743
00:58:55,067 --> 00:58:58,395
Choose which side you are on.

744
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:01,974
I know.
I know what I have to do.

745
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:04,708
And you're not going to get her.

746
00:59:05,151 --> 00:59:06,798
Orm, what's happening?

747
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,650
I know what I have to do.

748
00:59:08,653 --> 00:59:11,390
I can see it.
I can see the Queen's castle.

749
00:59:11,425 --> 00:59:13,055
I've changed my mind.

750
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,885
What do you mean?
I have to rescue Kai.

751
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:24,236
You don't
understand, you silly girl.

752
00:59:24,307 --> 00:59:26,512
You asked how the
Snow Queen can be defeated?

753
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:29,241
Well, here's my answer.
She can't!

754
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:33,219
No one.  No one will ever be able
to defeat that horrible woman.

755
00:59:33,254 --> 00:59:35,380
I don't need you.
You're a coward.

756
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:38,350
Just stay here and I'll go alone.
Luta?

757
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,997
So, I'm a coward, huh?

758
00:59:41,032 --> 00:59:43,064
You have no idea
what you're in for.

759
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:44,240
And you know what?

760
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:47,022
I'd rather be a living
coward than a dead hero.

761
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:51,747
You know Orm?  At a certain point,
I really thought you had changed.

762
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:53,282
But I guess I was wrong.

763
00:59:53,317 --> 00:59:55,006
- Good-bye.
- Fine.   Go.

764
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:59,115
And just let you know!  It's not
my fault that we're here, it's yours.

765
01:01:39,995 --> 01:01:41,084
Kai?

766
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:45,071
What's the matter?
Kai, don't you recognise me?

767
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:49,098
It's me, Gerda.
Oh please Kai, answer me.

768
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:54,069
He can't answer you, Gerda.

769
01:01:55,516 --> 01:02:00,091
Come on now.  Don't cry,
Gerda.  No need for tears.

770
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:06,491
Oh no it's her!
It's the Snow Queen!

771
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:27,378
You took my brother from me.

772
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:31,457
But I'm not afraid of you.
I want him back!

773
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:38,449
So you say you're
not afraid of me, do you?

774
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,971
Well I think you should be afraid.

775
01:02:42,379 --> 01:02:46,546
And you want to know why, Gerda?

776
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:51,980
Because the time has come for you
to join the rest of your family after all.

777
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,798
You're not going to win.

778
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:55,259
Really?

779
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:58,663
And who is going to stop me?

780
01:02:59,936 --> 01:03:02,613
Me.
I will stop you.

781
01:03:05,676 --> 01:03:08,714
You are a brave girl, Gerda.

782
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:10,316
You know...

783
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:14,384
I think we could have
perhaps been friends in another life.

784
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:18,224
But now I'm afraid,
it's not possible.

785
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,520
Well done, Troll.

786
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:24,366
You accomplished your mission.

787
01:03:24,604 --> 01:03:27,263
And as such I shall give my word.

788
01:03:27,573 --> 01:03:30,405
You may go.
Your reward awaits you.

789
01:03:33,215 --> 01:03:34,307
I'm sorry.

790
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,089
If I may, your Majesty.

791
01:03:40,157 --> 01:03:42,262
I've been your
servant for many years.

792
01:03:42,297 --> 01:03:44,586
And I've done the most
horrible and sickening things

793
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,493
at your bidding without hesitation.

794
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:50,103
But now, I'm begging you to listen
to this one request, your Majesty.

795
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:51,914
Please, let Gerda go.

796
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:54,070
Well, this is unexpected

797
01:03:54,078 --> 01:03:57,334
and very brave of you, Troll.

798
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,064
But also very stupid.

799
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:02,792
Get out of my sight and be gone.

800
01:04:02,827 --> 01:04:04,706
I shall deal with you later.

801
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:07,855
No, I don't belong to you anymore.

802
01:04:08,229 --> 01:04:09,789
Is that so?

803
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:12,865
And who has told you that?

804
01:04:13,737 --> 01:04:14,964
Gerda?

805
01:04:15,836 --> 01:04:18,929
So I guess the two of
you are best friends now.

806
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,240
Well then, perhaps it is time for you
to tell Gerda about your master plan

807
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:26,232
of bringing her to her death.

808
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:31,035
I ... was just
following her orders.

809
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:35,801
You hear that, Gerda?
This is your troll ...

810
01:04:37,238 --> 01:04:38,729
He betrayed you.

811
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:42,428
He is not your friend.
He will never change.

812
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:45,842
He will never be anything
more than a cowardly Troll.

813
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:49,706
Orm.  My name Orm!

814
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,411
Is there a mirror
anywhere in this castle?

815
01:05:13,446 --> 01:05:15,344
In the throne room!

816
01:06:07,317 --> 01:06:09,254
Keep running to the throne room!

817
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:10,787
I'm not leaving you.

818
01:06:10,822 --> 01:06:12,881
Run!  It will get you.
Run!

819
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:25,361
That mirror reveals
what your eyes cannot see.

820
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,624
It's all over, Gerda.

821
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:15,873
You are going to stay
in these halls forever.

822
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:23,658
Finally the time
for eternal frost is here.

823
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:32,210
Come on, Gerda.
Get up.

824
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:34,840
Stand up, my darling.
You can do it.

825
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:38,318
Father?
Mother?

826
01:08:38,857 --> 01:08:40,984
Get up, my beautiful girl.

827
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:43,661
I let everyone down.

828
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:46,397
I have nothing left in me.

829
01:08:46,907 --> 01:08:50,173
I can't go on.
I feel so alone.

830
01:08:51,184 --> 01:08:53,206
You are not alone, Gerda.

831
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:58,160
As long as you remember us,
we will remain in your heart

832
01:08:58,162 --> 01:08:59,390
forever.

833
01:09:00,466 --> 01:09:02,966
- Kai?
- Gerda.

834
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:07,035
I'm going to be proud
to call you my sister.

835
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:17,857
What?  What is this?
This can't be happening.

836
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:22,039
You thought you've taken
them all away from me, rogue.

837
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,405
You're wrong this time.

838
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:26,250
You'll have to rip
them out of my heart.

839
01:09:26,285 --> 01:09:28,750
No one can take them
away from me, do you hear me?

840
01:09:28,757 --> 01:09:29,978
No one.

841
01:09:35,668 --> 01:09:40,372
The Snow Queen fears looking
into Master Vegard's mirror.

842
01:09:48,928 --> 01:09:52,925
If I disappear, the
good disappears with me.

843
01:09:53,336 --> 01:09:54,357
Irma!

844
01:10:38,289 --> 01:10:41,326
Kai, wake up.
It's over, Kai.

845
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:44,764
The Snow Queen is gone.
Please wake up, Kai.

846
01:11:11,419 --> 01:11:13,321
Why you little white otter!

847
01:11:22,906 --> 01:11:26,473
So this is how the real
story of the Snow Queen ends.

848
01:11:26,549 --> 01:11:29,088
Kai and Gerda get their family back.

849
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:31,624
Little Irma learned that
having hatred in her heart

850
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:34,024
would only bring unhappiness.

851
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:37,030
And as for the brave
and handsome Troll, well.

852
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:39,565
He saved the
world from eternal frost.

853
01:11:39,945 --> 01:11:42,105
Ahem .. Orm.

854
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,415
Yeah ... well.

855
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:44,789
Alright, alright, alright.

856
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:50,051
The girl Gerda helped out too.
Maybe, just a little bit.

857
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:53,223
Trolls never get any of the glory.

858
01:11:56,301 --> 01:11:57,409
Whatever!
