1
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,840
Ana, something happened to Ama.

2
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,119
- What happened?
- I don't know, come and talk to her.

3
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,213
Estela, I always have to do it, you go.

4
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,287
She wants you, not me.

5
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,272
- Ana's here, Ama.
- Buenos dias.

6
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,465
Hello, Grandpa.

7
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,344
Say something.

8
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,045
- Mama?
- Who is it?

9
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,448
- It's Ana.
- Mija, come closer.

10
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:31,687
I'm really sick,
you'll have to make breakfast for the men.

11
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,424
Breakfast?

12
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:38,389
- Mama, can't Estela do that?
- Estela has a lot of work at the factory.

13
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:42,634
Mija, I woke up in the middle of the night,
soaking wet.

14
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,468
It was like I was on fire.

15
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,906
Okay, Mama, what's wrong?

16
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,969
Is it your legs?

17
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,074
- Si.
- What about your back?

18
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,577
- Si.
- And your head?

19
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,909
Yeah, that, too.

20
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,541
And how's your hearing?

21
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,479
What?

22
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,820
Today's my last day of high school,
I'm not gonna miss that.

23
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,423
Ungrateful.

24
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,828
So your pain is gone?

25
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,924
I struggle with it,
just like I struggled to give you birth...

26
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,498
and raise you and take care of this family.

27
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,594
Yes, it hurts!

28
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,139
I didn't ask
for you to give birth to me, okay?

29
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,396
That's enough.

30
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,173
Estela, what's wrong with your sister?

31
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,542
Come and help me.

32
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,652
Okay, seven years at M.I.T.

33
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,917
- Four years at Stanford.
- Four years of teacher's college.

34
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:26,157
I'll continue my education, too.
I'll backpack through Europe, and...

35
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,669
Ana, hang on a minute.

36
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,537
What's happening
with the college applications?

37
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,304
I'm not going to college.

38
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,211
What do you mean?

39
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,444
You're a smart woman
with something to contribute to this world.

40
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,312
My family can't afford college.

41
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,653
There are scholarships,
grants, financial aid...

42
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,988
everything we've been talking about all year.

43
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,527
Mr. Guzman,
I'm really sorry to have to say this...

44
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,689
but you should probably
spend your time helping somebody else.

45
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,733
Now, I have to go, but...

46
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,131
you were the best.

47
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,263
Thanks.

48
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,044
Thank you, come back again.

49
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,442
I've been waiting for this day.

50
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,281
- Yeah, me, too.
- Here's your uniform.

51
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,511
Just give me my check, okay.

52
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,448
That's sick.

53
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,924
I was keeping it warm for you
until you got here.

54
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,957
You know, you can always just kiss my ass
to get your job back.

55
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,482
Anita.

56
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,550
Come.

57
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,560
What?

58
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,792
Don't ask why.
Just come, I need to show you something.

59
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,462
All right.

60
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,965
Come on, hurry up.

61
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,264
Coming.

62
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,768
Okay.

63
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,848
Congratulations!

64
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,029
CONGRATULATIONS ANA

65
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,075
Thank you, cousins.

66
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,713
All the happiness, Ana...

67
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,044
Grandpa...

68
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,481
...for many years.

69
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,777
Look at your big cake.

70
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,348
Cake? Oh, my God.

71
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,324
Can't you see she's bigger than the cake?

72
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,690
Why did you quit your job?

73
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,664
- Why do you know about this?
- I just know.

74
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,663
- Okay, Mom, I quit my job.
- Why?

75
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,568
I didn't get along with the manager.

76
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,628
So what?

77
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,334
You're just gonna have to get another job.

78
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,537
I know, Papa, okay?
It's just something I had to do.

79
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,547
Tomorrow you come to work with us
in the factory.

80
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,477
- What?
- No way!

81
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,485
Estela, we're very far behind.

82
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,884
- We're not behind.
- Yes, we are.

83
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,418
If we don't help your sister,
who else is going to?

84
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,653
I don't know, and really, I don't care.

85
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,227
- Why do you have to say that?
- Because it's true.

86
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,033
Estela stays up all night
trying to finish those dresses.

87
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:53,231
- Papa, I can't afford any more help.
- That takes care of that.

88
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,571
If Estela cannot pay Ana,
it doesn't really help us.

89
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,038
She'll pay.

90
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,045
Fine, I'll pay her. She can iron.

91
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,877
End of discussion, senor. Who wants cake?

92
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,806
I want some.

93
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,714
A big one.

94
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,876
Take a small one.

95
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,822
Mr. Guzman, what are you doing here?

96
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,985
- Are your parents here?
- Yeah, but I told you...

97
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,050
Ana, who is it?

98
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,421
Good afternoon, sir. Ma'am.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,194
I'm Luis Guzman. I'm Ana's English teacher.

100
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,998
- I speak English.
- I'm sorry.

101
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,637
Ana's an excellent student.

102
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,140
I'd like to see her continue her education,
go to college.

103
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,941
Mr. Guzman,
of course we want Ana to get educated.

104
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,146
We have already discussed that
amongst our family.

105
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,513
But we need her to work now.

106
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,881
She can go to college later.

107
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,550
Senor Garcia,
Ana's a very special young woman.

108
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,529
She got into Beverly Hills High School...

109
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,861
which isn't easy,
and now she can go further.

110
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,798
There are all kinds of scholarships.

111
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Guzman...

112
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,037
but tomorrow morning
she goes to the factory...

113
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,436
to sew, with us.

114
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,143
May I ask you, Mr. Garcia,
just to please think about college.

115
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,384
I'll think about it. I'll talk to my wife.

116
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,685
Let's go, Anita.

117
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,425
I told you.

118
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,898
She doesn't do her chores...

119
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,271
she doesn't clean her room,
she doesn't do laundry...

120
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,336
she doesn't cook...

121
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,142
She gives me plenty of trouble.

122
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,574
Carmencita.

123
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,015
Ana doesn't give you that much trouble.

124
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,685
Look, her teacher...

125
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,549
is very happy with her.

126
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,585
If we make an effort...

127
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,491
I believe we can help her get into college,
to get an education.

128
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,593
I can teach her.

129
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,634
I can teach her to sew.

130
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,136
I can teach her to raise her kids...

131
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,466
and take care of her husband.

132
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,975
Those are things
they won't teach her in school.

133
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,841
It's all right, she can get married later.

134
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,805
Are you not listening to me?

135
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,014
It's a matter of principle.

136
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,451
It's not fair.

137
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,823
I worked since I was 13 years old...

138
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,085
and Ana is 18 years old.

139
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,319
Now it's her turn.

140
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,187
She has to work.

141
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,138
My life is over.

142
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,402
You're so dramatic, just like Ama.

143
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,309
Excuse me, but I'm nothing like Mom, okay?

144
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,682
Whatever you say.

145
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,108
Oh, my God.

146
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,736
Don't even think about it.

147
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,171
You'll never fit into that one. It's a Size 7.

148
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,873
- Why do you always have to be like this?
- I only tell you for your own good.

149
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,975
Look at you! Enormous!

150
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,714
- Don't!
- They must weight 10 kilos each!

151
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,722
Mom, what do you think you're doing?

152
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,519
You're so dramatic.

153
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,726
- Good morning, Mrs. Carmen.
- Good morning!

154
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,264
Good morning, Normita.
Good morning, Panchita.

155
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,698
Mrs. Carmen, how are you?

156
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,031
Very well, thank you.

157
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,097
Normita, you must be in love.

158
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,406
You look so fancy, I hardly recognized you.

159
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,143
My fiance bought me this dress.

160
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,045
Yeah? It's beautiful.

161
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,943
Just wait.

162
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,454
That happened with my husband,
and then he stopped buying me clothes.

163
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,455
Maybe it was your fault.

164
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,022
Why would it be my fault?

165
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,054
Just look at you.

166
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,023
Maybe the material got too expensive.

167
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,762
Envy or charity?

168
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,768
Like my grandmother used to say,
"There's no better dressing...

169
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,804
"than meat on bones."

170
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,432
And you are not going to make me cry.

171
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,575
You go ahead and cry, Panchita.
I'm going to the bakery.

172
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,439
Are you a new worker?

173
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,674
This is my daughter, Ana.

174
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,580
- Are you going to be working here full-time?
- No.

175
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,523
I'm just helping out my sister
until I find a better job.

176
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,853
Me, too.

177
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,589
I'm just working here until I win the lottery.

178
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,077
Mujeres, this is my daughter, Ana.

179
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,176
You know, the one I always complain about.

180
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,914
Mommy, she's Mrs. Carmen's daughter.

181
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,684
I can't believe
you finally made it to the factory.

182
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,248
Yeah, what took you so long?

183
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,523
I had a meeting with a supplier,
but that's none of your business.

184
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,029
This is Dona Carlota.

185
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,066
This is an overlock, which makes hems.
She's a pro.

186
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,728
Welcome, I hope you like the job.

187
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,702
And this is Pancha and her machine.

188
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,797
We already met.

189
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,035
Don't touch anything
that belongs to Pancha.

190
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,442
She really gets upset,
you'd think it was her baby.

191
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,140
- That's not true.
- It is true.

192
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:54,709
This is another overlock machine.
Norma does the work, and she's very fast.

193
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,254
I'm Carlota's daughter...

194
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,348
and these are my sisters,
Lupita and Angelica.

195
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,950
And this is Rosali, the troublemaker.

196
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,695
And this is Ama's station.

197
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,929
These scissors are yours. Don't lose them.

198
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,664
- Everything gets lost in this place.
- Come on, let me show you your job.

199
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,434
- Pay attention.
- Ama, are you doing your work?

200
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,908
Yes, my general.

201
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,976
Watch. We do high quality work here, okay?
That's why I get the orders.

202
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,986
It's so hot in here. Can't you get a fan?

203
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,078
We have a fan.

204
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,623
You know that the fan blows dust
on the dresses.

205
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,927
Always use the steam, okay?
And please don't burn the tulle.

206
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,932
- Okay.
- Okay, it's real easy work.

207
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,801
And always check the level of the water
and let me know when it gets low, okay?

208
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,230
So I can send you out to buy some more.

209
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,502
When you're done, you put the dress here...

210
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,170
on the bagger,
you put a plastic bag over it...

211
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,611
and you put it on that rack for me, okay?

212
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,206
If we work hard today, we'll finish these.

213
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,513
That'll be one hundred in Size 7.

214
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,919
Did you hear, Mrs. Carlota?
We're close to 100.

215
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,456
What a beautiful dress.

216
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,254
We take the finished dresses
to the distributor and then start on Size 6.

217
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,829
How much do they pay us
to make these dresses?

218
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,956
$18 for assembling each.

219
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,597
And how much do they
sell them for at the stores?

220
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,193
They sell them at Bloomingdale's for $600.

221
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,836
We make them for $18,
they sell them for $600...

222
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,933
does this seem right to you?

223
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,074
Just work, okay?

224
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,175
I don't think she knows how to do anything.

225
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,913
I don't think she'll make it,
and with her mother here...

226
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,454
She's so arrogant.

227
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,427
I have chisme from the market.

228
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,488
Mommy, Mrs. Carmen has gossip.

229
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,395
I love gossip.

230
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,732
You should be working!

231
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,369
El Dorado Ortiz...

232
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,536
is secretly in love with Rosali.

233
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,901
That's horrible.

234
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,975
That dirty old man...

235
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,175
looks like a shriveled-up mango.

236
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,283
El Dorado Ortiz is in love with Rosali.

237
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,652
He thinks you're too skinny,
but he would love...

238
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,023
to fatten you up.

239
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,290
But don't get as fat as Ana.

240
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,797
Ama, we have to work now.

241
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,094
Yes, my general.

242
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,275
- You burned it!
- Ana, can't you do anything right!

243
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,215
Where are you going?

244
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,777
You little brat. Wait!

245
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,550
Come here! Don't make me come after you!

246
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,257
Ana!

247
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,564
What's going on here?

248
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,328
This is my mom.

249
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,105
Is this your daughter?

250
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,404
Yeah, this fatty.

251
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,745
My daughter.

252
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,743
Knock yourself out, ladies.

253
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,213
Where are you going?

254
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,424
Where the hell are you going?

255
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,571
I can't take it anymore.

256
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,534
I'm too old for this.

257
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,584
I don't know why I'm working.

258
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,650
My hands have arthritis.

259
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,422
And I'm going blind from so much sewing.

260
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:58,029
Yeah, Mama, I know, okay.
Everybody knows.

261
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,594
Leave! If you want to leave, leave!

262
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,562
What?

263
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,704
Am I embarrassing you?

264
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,002
Are you ashamed to work with us?

265
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,974
So much effort, so much sacrifice...

266
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,249
And all for what?

267
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,253
For you.

268
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,327
You only think I'm a beast of burden.

269
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,659
Ama, come on let's go.
Let's go back, come on.

270
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,137
Oh, my God.

271
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,909
Hold onto me.
Come on, we're gonna go back.

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,946
You have to help me.

273
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,393
Come on.

274
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,862
You behave, okay?

275
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,232
How cute! Look at yourself in the mirror.

276
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,756
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Gorgonia.

277
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,555
- How did you sleep?
- Okay, and you?

278
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,221
How do you think, with my arthritis?

279
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,001
I see you have a new Saint Antonio.

280
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,264
That's for Ana.

281
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,873
And how many years
have you had this one hanging here?

282
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,346
That one...

283
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,013
Eleven years.

284
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,314
I put it up on Estela's 18th birthday.

285
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,755
I'm gonna take it down.

286
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,121
No! Leave it there.

287
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,463
Who knows, Estela could still get married.

288
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:23,332
It's too late for Estela to get married.
Now I have to concentrate on Ana.

289
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,142
They're delicious.

290
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
That's how I like them.

291
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,685
You're a treasure.

292
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,555
Grandpa...

293
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,217
Do you remember our gold...

294
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,229
close to our hometown, near the hills?

295
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,458
There was a cave full of gold.

296
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,199
Papa, those are only legends.

297
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,306
And the men who saw
the cave and the gold?

298
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,539
The gold doesn't exist, Dad.

299
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,046
Grandpa, tell me about the treasure.

300
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,144
Many years ago, during the Revolution...

301
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,685
people would hide their gold
in the caves in the mountains.

302
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,054
After the Revolution, there was a rumor...

303
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,951
that there was a cave full of gold...

304
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,890
close to our hometown.

305
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,657
Inside the cave...

306
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,668
there was a sign
painted on the wall, that said:

307
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:31,832
"This gold can only be taken
by a man with a pure heart."

308
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,308
I always wanted to find that gold.

309
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,251
Grandpa, I'm sure you're going to find it.

310
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,680
Look, I already found it. You are my gold.

311
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,889
Now I want you to find yours.

312
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,295
- Jimmy.
- What's up?

313
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,160
- Ana, how's it going?
- Mr. Guzman, I did it.

314
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,531
- I filled out the applications.
- Look at that, Ana, way to go.

315
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,501
- Is it the truth?
- Of course it is. I don't lie on applications.

316
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,870
Except about my weight.

317
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,311
Where's the personal statement?

318
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,250
- I didn't think it was necessary.
- You didn't write one?

319
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,044
You have to write one.

320
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,253
I'm friendly with
the Dean of Admissions at Columbia.

321
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,490
If you write it now I can get it to him
and get you in for the September semester.

322
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,361
- Really?
- But look, you need to write an essay.

323
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,368
- About what?
- Write about something you know.

324
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,233
- You can write about yourself.
- Myself?

325
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,532
Why not?

326
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,401
You can do this.
I'll keep this until you bring me the essay.

327
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,341
Go, write.

328
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,469
Bye.

329
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,557
When are you going to Europe?

330
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,431
Hey, Jimmy.
I don't know if I'm going anymore.

331
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,937
My sister needs me to stay
and help her with her fashion boutique.

332
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,097
I was thinking about joining you,
but you're not going anymore?

333
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,198
No.

334
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,074
Europe is so cool.
You'll get a whole new perspective.

335
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,169
What kind of perspective?

336
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,811
It's different in Europe.
Things are too easy here.

337
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,248
Like you're handed everything
from school to a car.

338
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,191
That's why I want to teach,
do something different, you know?

339
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,285
I'm doing some assistant work
for Mr. Guzman this summer.

340
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,191
What are you doing?

341
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,130
I have to go, so I'll see you later.

342
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,775
Your number?

343
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,376
Maybe we could hang out.

344
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,947
Yeah, I gotta go.

345
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,273
Bye.

346
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,049
It's finished.

347
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,558
With that music, they want to get on TV.

348
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,831
They need to improve a little bit.

349
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,355
Yeah, I'd say.

350
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,971
Carmencita, your back hurting again?

351
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:27,143
After 38 years of sewing,
what else do you expect?

352
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:42,926
Estela, Ana, you really missed something
in the soap opera The Poor Cry More.

353
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,691
Mom, I don't watch Spanish soap operas.

354
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,790
It's not a regular novela, it's a Brazilian.

355
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,199
- They're better. Isn't that so?
- Much better.

356
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,327
What happened?

357
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,567
You remember Juanita,
the cross-eyed daughter?

358
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,696
Yes, I remember.

359
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,003
Well...

360
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,878
This handsome, dark stranger...

361
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,609
comes to visit the fishing village.

362
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,311
And she meets him...

363
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,757
and he told her that he didn't care
what she looked like...

364
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:18,451
that he loves her, that he wants her...

365
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,488
but of course we know what he wanted, no?

366
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:27,397
One night, without telling her parents,
Juanita goes out with the stranger.

367
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,274
Mom, let me guess, she gets pregnant?

368
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,500
Ana, don't spoil the story.

369
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,805
- What happened?
- She gets pregnant.

370
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:41,985
And worse,
he asks her to run away with him.

371
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,181
Of course that means
that she has to betray her mother's wishes.

372
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:51,192
- And then?
- Entonces, they're on the bus to Rio...

373
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:55,198
and she sticks
out her head to say goodbye...

374
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,929
to her mother who was crying there.

375
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,364
And all of a sudden this bus comes by...

376
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,843
And it cut her head off!

377
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,109
Mom, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

378
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,546
Ana, you better listen.

379
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,881
That's what happens
to people who don't listen to their mother.

380
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,615
- Okay.
- And all you had was the headless body.

381
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,823
- Hello?
- Hi, Jimmy, it's Ana.

382
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,356
Hey, Ana!

383
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,718
Are you busy?

384
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,559
Is this a bad time? I can call you back later.

385
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,089
- I mean, I'm just calling to say hi.
- No, it's a good time, actually.

386
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,729
Listen to this insane computer program
I found on the web.

387
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,696
"Mierda." "Shit."

388
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,834
It's curse words in Spanish.

389
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,638
Really?

390
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,303
"Ya la cague." "I screwed up."

391
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,645
Where did you get this?

392
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,619
"Pendejo." "Jerk." "Pinche." "Goddamn it."

393
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,121
All right, okay, Jimmy, I get it.

394
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,452
Hello?

395
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,387
Do you think I'm your maid?

396
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,397
You left dishes in the sink.

397
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,600
Get water, the burner's here.

398
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,072
Shut up, she's coming.

399
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,402
We almost finished pinning the pattern.

400
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:51,840
Look. What do you think?

401
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:52,940
Okay.

402
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,548
Just a few little adjustments here
and then we can get started.

403
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,890
Aren't we supposed to be working?

404
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,421
We're already behind schedule.

405
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,690
Why isn't everyone here?

406
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,596
Norma, why are you late?
Where's your mother and your sisters?

407
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,399
Estela, I need to talk to you.

408
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,664
Okay.

409
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,664
Estela, I'm sorry.

410
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,937
I say this from the heart.

411
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,740
Why are you sorry?

412
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,581
I wanted to tell you earlier,
but I didn't know how to tell you.

413
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,844
Tell me. What?

414
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,749
I'm getting married sooner than I thought.

415
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,312
- When's the wedding?
- Next month.

416
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,925
- I'm so happy for you.
- In Mexico.

417
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,461
I have to leave tomorrow.

418
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,928
My fiance wants me
to move with him to Mexico.

419
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,865
Norma, you're my fastest employee.
I need you.

420
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,199
I know. I'm so proud
of the work that I've done for you.

421
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,068
I'm sorry that I have to leave.
And you're my best boss.

422
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,909
My mother and my sisters
are moving with us.

423
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,039
- You're all leaving me?
- No, Norma, por favor!

424
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,143
It's always been my mother's dream
to go back to her village in Mexico.

425
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,848
I'm sorry. Perdoname.

426
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,915
Don't be sorry, I'm happy for you.

427
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,826
I just can't pay you right now, okay?

428
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:12,988
I'm sorry.

429
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,328
Give my check
to my cousin at the Chapala Market.

430
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,368
Okay, gracias.

431
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,226
Good luck.

432
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,784
Mrs. Carmen...

433
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,431
thank you for everything.

434
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,460
God bless you.

435
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,782
We need those four seamstresses
to finish this work.

436
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,518
I mean, we never finish on time.
You know the Glitz company.

437
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:20,655
They don't pay me until we do.
I have no money to pay any of you.

438
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,699
- I should just close the factory.
- No, you can't close the factory.

439
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,966
I can't believe you're paying us late again.

440
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,873
I just lost four seamstresses.
How are we gonna finish this order?

441
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:36,004
- I can wait a little bit, but not too long.
- Gracias, Rosali.

442
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,545
And you, Pancha?

443
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,517
I'll charge you interest.

444
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,945
- Are you serious?
- No.

445
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,712
But let's get back to work
before I change my mind.

446
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,858
And you, Mrs. Carmen?

447
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,228
What kind of a mother would I be
if I didn't help my daughter?

448
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,425
And you say I don't love you.

449
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,670
It's because I love you
that I make your life so miserable.

450
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,835
Don't love me so much.

451
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,636
And you, girl?

452
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,342
Estela, if you don't pay me,
how am I gonna save up any money?

453
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,745
For what?

454
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,552
- Forget it.
- Ana, you're so selfish.

455
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,814
You expect me to do this dirty work
for nothing?

456
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,086
This is dirty work?

457
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,050
This is a sweatshop.

458
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,784
Don't you get it?

459
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,362
You're all cheap labor for Bloomingdale's!

460
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,430
We are not cheap labor.

461
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:34,270
How would you know what hard work is?
All you've done is flip burgers!

462
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:38,604
I'm grateful for what Ama has taught me.
And I'm proud of what I do!

463
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:39,665
You little brat!

464
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,874
I never wanted to work here
in the first place!

465
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,778
Much less for nothing.

466
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,543
See the trouble you cause?

467
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,259
Estela?

468
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,998
Come on, I'm sorry, okay?

469
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,663
- I'll help you.
- Can you work until I can pay you?

470
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,903
Yeah.

471
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,708
Thanks.

472
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,981
Let's get back to work.

473
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,540
You burned yourself, dear!

474
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,171
"Heal, heal, little frog tail.

475
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,050
"If it doesn't heal now,
it will heal tomorrow."

476
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,623
Fatty, wake up.

477
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,991
- What time is it?
- It's still night.

478
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,028
Then why are you waking me up?

479
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:20,033
I have a secret. I'm telling it only to you.

480
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,965
Mom, I'm sleeping.

481
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,901
You're not gonna believe this,
but I'm pregnant.

482
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,704
What?

483
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,674
- I'm pregnant.
- How could you be pregnant?

484
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,718
A woman knows these things.
But don't tell anybody.

485
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,185
Mom, you're imagining things.

486
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,158
Ana, I need you more than ever now.

487
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,559
It's probably just gas.

488
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,687
Eat less beans.

489
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,251
Why did Norma and the others
have to leave?

490
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,263
That doesn't look that bad.

491
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,389
Ladies...

492
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,729
You are not going to believe this.

493
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,129
I heard gossip at the Chapala Market.

494
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,833
No food in the work place.

495
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,338
It's our break time.

496
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,037
Then you take a break,
because I can't afford one.

497
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,869
Come.

498
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,376
Our Normita...

499
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,710
ate the cake before the wedding.

500
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:48,723
I heard that Norma's fiance
convinced her to have sex...

501
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:52,524
with him the night before,
and after he had a taste...

502
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:58,530
100 people at the church,
the priest waiting...

503
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,571
and he never showed up for the ceremony.

504
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,731
God damn him.

505
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,367
Norma's mother never approved
of the man...

506
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,206
pero Norma insisted.

507
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,174
No, no.

508
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,612
A mother knows
the right man for her daughter.

509
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,513
Mom, you're so old-fashioned.

510
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,889
Can you believe her?
Girls nowadays think they know so much.

511
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,021
- That's why they end up panzonas.
- No, the reason they end up pregnant...

512
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,532
is 'cause they don't know
how to use contraceptives.

513
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,830
Look at her, Miss Know-It-All.

514
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,995
Your husband won't like you
knowing so much.

515
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,767
- Why?
- A man wants a virgin.

516
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,638
Why is a woman's virginity
the only thing that matters?

517
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,305
A woman has thoughts,
ideas, a mind of her own.

518
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,413
A mind, and thoughts?

519
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,687
No more stories, Ama!

520
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,553
Estela, that's what I do best!

521
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,622
My reason for living.

522
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,600
Sorry.

523
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,608
- What are you writing?
- I'm writing a letter to Mrs. Glass.

524
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,810
Who's that?

525
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,281
She's the owner
of the manufacturing company.

526
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,649
She's the one who pays us
to make these dresses.

527
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,314
Yeah, I'm asking for an advance
on the dress order.

528
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,052
I need to pay the electricity
and the monthly bills.

529
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,562
- I'm late on the rent.
- Estela, that's serious.

530
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,125
I know.

531
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,565
If you really need this money,
you should go and talk to her in person.

532
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,902
- A letter's not gonna do anything.
- She's too busy, she won't see me.

533
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,803
- I'll go with you.
- She's too busy.

534
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,408
You're not afraid of her, are you?

535
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,010
Why should I be afraid of her?

536
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,790
Ana, please don't say anything, okay?

537
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,257
I can try.

538
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,258
Hi, is Mrs. Glass here?

539
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,791
Who are you?

540
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:10,197
I'm a contractor for Mrs. Glass,
my name is Estela Garcia.

541
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,758
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

542
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,232
You need an appointment.

543
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,733
Okay, we don't have an appointment,
let's go.

544
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,469
Hello, Mrs. Glass.

545
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,410
- Estela.
- Hi.

546
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,812
What can I do for you?

547
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,079
I know that last month
we were a couple of days late...

548
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,708
but...

549
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,189
we were hoping that...

550
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,586
that you...

551
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,116
We need an advance. Money...

552
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,022
to pay the bills,
the electricity so that we can work...

553
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,588
and get you your dresses
on time when you need them.

554
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,596
And who are you?

555
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,907
I'm Estela's business partner, Ana.

556
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,367
Ana, Estela knows the rules.

557
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,443
I can't pay advances.

558
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,274
I went out on a limb
to hire you in the first place...

559
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,185
because I believe a woman like me
should help one like you...

560
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,348
but I can only help you so much.

561
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,426
You have to help yourself
and meet your deadlines.

562
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,363
You have until the end of the month,
when the order has to be shipped.

563
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,797
You have 10 days, honey. 10 days, that's it.

564
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,666
I'll be back at 3:00.

565
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,168
She's worse than you said.

566
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,868
Did you say something, Estela?

567
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,810
- No.
- Because it sounded like you did.

568
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,779
I didn't say anything.

569
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,741
I see.

570
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,083
You ladies have a nice day.

571
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,359
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

572
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,555
I was just trying to help.

573
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,863
I'm trying to keep the factory open
for all of us.

574
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,565
You know, people depend on me.

575
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,671
Your mother is waiting for you, dear.

576
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,172
Your mother is a little crazy.

577
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,546
You're just figuring this out?

578
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,078
She's asking for her little girl.

579
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,819
Who knows what she might want?

580
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,651
- Hi.
- Hi.

581
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,989
What?

582
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,618
Shut the door.

583
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,533
I have morning sickness.

584
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,443
Mom, it's not morning, it's evening.

585
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,335
Ana, be serious.

586
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,307
Comfort me.

587
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,518
Did you ever think
that maybe you're not pregnant...

588
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,214
and you're just imagining all of this?

589
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,386
I am pregnant. A woman knows.

590
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,255
I haven't had my period for three months.

591
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:57,558
Then why don't you go talk to the doctor,
not me.

592
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,722
- Are you ready to leave?
- I'm coming, Grandpa!

593
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,321
Let's go.

594
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,971
- And where are you two going?
- Ana invited me to the movies tonight.

595
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,638
I think it's a great idea.

596
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,005
Bye, Dad.

597
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,509
- Don't wait up for us.
- Have fun.

598
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,442
Thank you, good night.

599
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,453
Okay.

600
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,183
We'll meet here in two hours.

601
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:54,750
Be good.

602
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,671
Hi.

603
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,880
- This is a great place.
- Yeah.

604
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,581
Are you staring at my boobs?

605
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,217
No.

606
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,753
Yes, no.

607
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,654
Okay.

608
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,331
I mean, they're so big,
why wouldn't you, right?

609
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,270
I'm a guy, I guess I kind of have to.

610
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:42,898
Can we change the subject?

611
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,203
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

612
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,313
I made this list of topics to talk about...

613
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,679
so that we wouldn't run out
of things to talk about.

614
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,279
Okay.

615
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,815
Can I see the list?

616
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,932
You have a really beautiful face.

617
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,998
Just my face?

618
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,512
I'm sorry.

619
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,146
You don't take compliments well?

620
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:30,516
No. Compliments,
that's not one of the topics on my list.

621
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,149
And you don't want to show me the list?

622
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,826
- No.
- No.

623
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,292
Are big breasts on the list?

624
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,894
- Hi.
- Let's order.

625
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,853
- I had a nice night tonight.
- Me, too.

626
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,096
That's where I have to meet my grandpa.

627
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,565
I guess this is good night.

628
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,210
Okay, bye.

629
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,646
Bye.

630
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,339
It's that time again, Panchita?

631
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,709
Yes.

632
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,054
Today's the anniversary
of my father's death.

633
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,763
He was so handsome.

634
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,927
Yes.

635
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,292
He was a very elegant man.

636
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,933
The day he died...

637
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,269
I couldn't pay the hospital...

638
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,201
so I pretended...

639
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,105
that he was still alive...

640
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,343
and I put him in a wheelchair...

641
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,855
and I took him home in a taxi.

642
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,661
You were a good daughter, Panchita.

643
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,926
I tried.

644
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,674
- Hi, Estela.
- Hi, Mr. Hiro.

645
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,474
- The rent is three weeks late.
- I'm so sorry.

646
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,606
Will you be able to pay rent
by the end of the month?

647
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,016
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

648
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,951
I like having you as a tenant
and I'd hate to have to kick you out.

649
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,083
No.

650
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,584
Say hi to Rosali for me.

651
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,160
I will.

652
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,724
Bye.

653
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,410
Papa!

654
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,415
Anita.

655
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,321
- What are you doing here?
- Papi, I need some help.

656
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,388
I told Estela this many times.

657
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,926
"If you do not have the cash up front...

658
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,789
"do not do it."

659
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,666
Yes, I know, but she's working hard...

660
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,967
and it's just not working out.

661
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,435
She still has to pay the rent.

662
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:51,242
I know, Papa, but it's not her fault.

663
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,216
I mean, I never realized how hard she works.

664
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,751
Okay.

665
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,319
I will lend Estela the money.

666
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,589
Thank you, Papa.

667
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,921
Estela, let me see.

668
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,614
It's beautiful.

669
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,827
- Did you draw it yourself?
- Yes.

670
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,863
You're lying.
You probably copied it from a magazine.

671
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,227
No, I did it.

672
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,631
I'm working on my own line.
Would you buy a dress like this?

673
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:23,230
Of course I would buy a dress like this.
If it would fit me.

674
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,147
This gray dress is
the biggest order I've ever had.

675
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,853
It won't be easy.

676
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:42,290
If we don't finish it by the end of the month
the manufacturer won't pay us.

677
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,452
Let's prove to them that we can do it.

678
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:48,624
Let's make 150 gray dresses
of better quality than anyone else.

679
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,883
Estela, maybe we can
turn on the fan in here.

680
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,152
The fan blows dust on the dresses.

681
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,847
Can you iron a little faster?

682
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,484
I need help with the hems,
we won't make the deadline.

683
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,552
Estela, it's not that I don't iron fast enough.

684
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,097
Every time I finish ironing,
I stop for a minute...

685
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,065
to really look at the dress.

686
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:28,127
I never realized how much work,
"puro lomo," as mom says...

687
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,729
is put into it.

688
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:36,375
And then I wake up,
and I remind myself that it's not for me.

689
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:42,317
So I put that plastic bag over it.
And stick it on the rack...

690
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,753
push it away.

691
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,847
She got a point.

692
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,366
Come on, hurry up.

693
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,233
Straighten up, walk like a lady.

694
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,405
Even I, in my condition, I walk like a lady.

695
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,455
Hi.

696
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,260
Hi.

697
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,804
Is Ana there?

698
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,141
Who is this?

699
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,268
This is Cecilia.

700
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,479
Yes. I will call her for you.

701
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,833
Do you want to hear music tonight?

702
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,636
No thank you.

703
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,843
Let's go, guys.

704
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,206
Good evening.

705
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,677
- Hi.
- Ready to go?

706
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,872
What's wrong?

707
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,470
Jimmy, does your mom understand you?

708
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,713
Most of the time.

709
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,914
- Does your mom?
- No.

710
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,514
I don't know, it's like she hates me.

711
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,152
She thinks I'm fat and I'm ugly
and God knows what...

712
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,752
You're not fat.

713
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,391
You're beautiful.

714
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,237
Where did you tell your mom
you were tonight?

715
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,200
She thinks I'm at Mass again.

716
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,140
So, is this a sin?

717
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,043
No, that's a beso.

718
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,613
A kiss.

719
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:43,626
Can't believe I'm leaving in two weeks
to go to teacher's college.

720
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,167
Ana, don't worry.

721
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,836
You're gonna get accepted to college, too.

722
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,324
Are we done?

723
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,699
You have one more dress to iron.

724
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,362
Estela, this is beautiful.

725
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,602
Did you make this?

726
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,702
- What's it for?
- It's for you.

727
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:33,112
Come on, you know I can't fit into this.

728
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,883
I cut this especially for your body, okay?

729
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:40,088
Pretty dresses aren't just for skinny girls.

730
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,983
This one's yours.

731
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,421
- I spent a lot of money on this material.
- Shut up!

732
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,767
Your turn.

733
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,434
Thank you, darling.

734
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,042
- Whose turn is it?
- Mine.

735
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,074
Here's my piece.

736
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,544
What do you want?

737
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,589
Senora, can I please speak
to your daughter?

738
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,819
- No, she's not here.
- Mama, what are you talking about?

739
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,794
- I'm right here, open the door.
- What's going on now?

740
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,991
It's that man who's always looking for Ana.

741
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,499
Okay, let me see.

742
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,465
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

743
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,137
- Come in.
- Thanks.

744
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,100
- You did it.
- What?

745
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,201
- You got in.
- What?

746
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,269
The Dean called me personally
with the news.

747
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,281
My God, are you serious?

748
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,374
Your daughter's been
accepted for admission...

749
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,511
to Columbia University
with a full scholarship.

750
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,389
Please, come in, sit down.

751
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,948
I got accepted with a scholarship?

752
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,020
So, where is this Columbia University?

753
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,588
It's in New York City.

754
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,894
New York?

755
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,594
What's wrong with that?

756
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,837
Look, Mr. Guzman, it isn't that
we don't want Ana to go to college...

757
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,000
but all the way to New York?

758
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,912
I'm sure there must be
wonderful colleges in this area.

759
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,178
But none of them is Columbia University.

760
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:16,480
Papa, you don't understand,
it's one of the best schools in the nation.

761
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,918
Sir, you left your country
for a better opportunity...

762
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,914
and now, it's Ana's turn.

763
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,653
- Look, Mr. Guzman...
- Raul!

764
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,328
Senor Guzman...

765
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:29,996
we are a family,
and we intend to stay that way.

766
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,326
Mama, it's not gonna change anything.

767
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,527
Please.

768
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,863
It's okay, Carmencita.

769
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:43,775
Mr. Guzman, Ana is going to go to college.
But not now.

770
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,312
I didn't come this far
to see my family break apart.

771
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:51,285
Papa, I don't understand.
How is this breaking us apart?

772
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,052
What about Estela and the factory?

773
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:57,882
What about it?

774
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,690
What about abuelo?

775
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,032
You want to abandon him?

776
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,103
No.

777
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,418
Thank you very much, Senor Guzman...

778
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,082
but this is a family matter.

779
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:36,291
Thank you very much
for coming all the way here to tell us.

780
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,660
Don't put chilies on the nopalitos.
I'll get an upset stomach.

781
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,764
Then don't eat them.

782
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:14,925
Listen...

783
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:19,937
Have you heard that if you take the baby
away from Saint Antonio he'll work faster?

784
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,001
Si. Didn't you know that?

785
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:49,460
Hi.

786
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,436
A cigar for my grandpa, please.

787
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,633
I know what kind he likes.

788
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,006
Can I get some condoms, too?

789
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,074
What kind do you want?

790
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,817
I don't know, what do you recommend?

791
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,390
These are kind of fun.

792
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:14,685
All right.

793
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:15,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

794
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:33,910
The door.

795
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:48,862
Let's do it.

796
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,922
Are you sure?

797
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,465
I'm ready.

798
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,713
- Hold on, damn this shirt!
- How do you say "damn" in Spanish?

799
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,977
Pinche.

800
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,652
Pinche the shirt.

801
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,148
What are you laughing at?

802
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,439
Hold on.

803
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:56,891
Pinche.

804
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:04,564
Wait.

805
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,537
Turn the lights on. I want you to see me.

806
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,117
See, this is what I look like.

807
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,968
What a beauty.

808
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,912
I'll write to you.

809
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:51,777
No.

810
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,382
- I'll e-mail you.
- No.

811
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,117
Jimmy, really.

812
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,254
Don't worry about me anymore, okay?

813
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,265
I mean, once you get to college...

814
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,268
we won't have anything
to talk about, anyway...

815
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:11,102
and I don't know, you'll probably end up
meeting some skinny girl, right?

816
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,803
I'm really gonna miss you.

817
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:23,776
You tramp.

818
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,874
What?

819
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,610
You lost your virginity, didn't you?

820
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,484
- Mom, you're imagining things.
- I can tell!

821
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,991
You're not only fat, now you're a puta!

822
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,526
You would say that, wouldn't you?

823
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,563
Why didn't you value yourself?

824
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:45,259
Because there's more to me
than what's in between my legs!

825
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:50,070
You better not get pregnant
and embarrass me.

826
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,369
Me, embarrass you? Come on.

827
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,240
You're the one pretending
to be pregnant for attention.

828
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,870
- I am pregnant.
- You're not!

829
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,006
- Yes, I am!
- You're not pregnant, Mom!

830
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,415
You're only pretending
because you want a baby in the house.

831
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,944
But you can't have a baby.
I'm not your baby anymore!

832
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,124
No, senora, you're not pregnant.

833
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,054
Of course I am.

834
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:20,026
Dona Carmen, don't you think
I know a thing or two about this?

835
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,696
I haven't had a period in four months.

836
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,806
Dona Carmen,
that's not unusual for a woman your age.

837
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,580
I think it's about time you and I...

838
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,445
had a little conversation about menopause.

839
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,818
That means "the change of life."

840
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,783
Mom, the doctor said no sugar.
Why are you eating a flan?

841
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:47,386
- I'm having a craving.
- But you're not pregnant.

842
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,799
Okay, I'm not pregnant.

843
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,370
I'm going through the change of life.

844
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,569
It's over.

845
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,339
I'm no longer a woman.

846
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,503
A grandmother is what I should be
at this age.

847
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,272
You know, Ana...

848
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,718
you're not bad looking.

849
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,445
- Lf you lost weight...
- Just stop it!

850
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:14,750
You could be beautiful!

851
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,793
Stop it! You're overweight, too!

852
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:22,820
- So why should I listen to you?
- Ana, don't eat the flan.

853
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,560
This is beautiful.

854
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,260
I stink.

855
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:00,762
Damn!

856
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,235
Who farted?

857
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,507
He who smells it first
is the one who has it beneath him.

858
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,374
Ana, please don't waste the distilled water,
it's expensive.

859
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,543
Estela, it's so hot in here.

860
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,253
Seriously, I feel like I'm in hell.

861
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,993
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- How many more dresses to finish?

862
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,087
Eighteen.

863
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:30,860
Only 18?

864
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,166
Such a relief we're almost done with this.

865
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,798
Ana! What are you doing?

866
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,171
Mama, come on.

867
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,802
It's so hot, all the steam
has me sweating like a pig.

868
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,847
We're sweating, too,
but we're not taking our clothes off.

869
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:46,847
Why not?

870
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,350
We're all women,
we all have the same things.

871
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,275
Put it on.

872
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,647
Estela, Rosali, Pancha, please.

873
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:56,953
Aren't you hot in those clothes?
I feel so sticky.

874
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,726
- Aren't you embarrassed?
- Of what?

875
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,626
Look at you, you look awful.

876
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,562
Mama, I happen to like myself.

877
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,259
Right on, sister!

878
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,323
And you?

879
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,202
The two of you should lose weight.

880
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,569
You would look beautiful
without all that fat!

881
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,666
Dona Carmen, Ana and Estela are beautiful.

882
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:17,439
- They look good the way they are!
- Thank you, Pancha.

883
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,037
Thank you, Pancha.

884
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,411
Aren't you ashamed?

885
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,849
- Mama, you look just like us.
- Yes, but I'm married.

886
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:27,218
So that's it. Make myself attractive
so that I can catch a man.

887
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:31,259
Ana, listen to her.
Learn now or you'll end up like Estela.

888
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:34,456
Mama, I do want to lose weight.

889
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:38,288
And part of me doesn't because
my weight says to everybody, fuck you!

890
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,460
Hail Mary! What are you trying to do?

891
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,834
How dare anybody tell me
what I should look like...

892
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,133
or what I should be...

893
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,640
when there's so much more to me
than just my weight!

894
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:49,200
What's wrong with
wanting to be thin and sexy?

895
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,438
You don't get it.

896
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,173
I want to be taken seriously.

897
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,546
Respected for what I think,
not for how I look.

898
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,518
- Exactly, thank you.
- What if you don't think anything?

899
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,252
I look like a cow.

900
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,753
Rosali, shut up!
Stand up, you know, look at yourself.

901
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,159
If you're a cow, then I'm a hippo.

902
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:10,357
- And I'm an elephant.
- And I'm orca.

903
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,702
You are so skinny
in comparison to all of us.

904
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,838
No, I'm not, look at my fat hips.

905
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,672
- Come on.
- And my cellulite.

906
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,040
You want to see cellulite?

907
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,602
All right, here we go. You started it.

908
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,472
It's not fat, cellulite.

909
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,517
This is cellulite.

910
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:30,882
Excuse me, ladies.

911
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,484
This is cellulite!

912
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,388
All right, Estela, it's not that bad.

913
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,551
That's nothing.

914
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,094
But you don't understand.

915
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,754
I got all these stretch marks...

916
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,321
in my arms and chi-chis, look.

917
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,061
That's small, honey.
You want stretch marks?

918
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,330
Here you go, okay?

919
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,567
I have stretch marks
that go from north to south.

920
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,266
Ladies, ladies...

921
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,873
let me show you stretch marks.

922
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,044
From east to west!

923
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,380
Jesus, she wins.

924
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,094
Have you all gone mad?

925
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,665
Ladies, look, how beautiful we are!

926
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,896
And how good this feels!

927
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:23,034
To be rid of all these clothes
and just let it all hang out!

928
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,572
Okay, ladies, we have work to do. Come on.

929
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:29,077
Who cares what we look like
when no one's watching us?

930
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,408
Mama, aren't you hot?

931
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,880
Mama, what's that scar?

932
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,049
This one?

933
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,578
This one is you.

934
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,386
That's a big scar.

935
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,633
Look at you.

936
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,199
Look at all of you.

937
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,844
This is who we are, Mama.

938
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,910
Real women.

939
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,880
You have no shame.

940
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,485
Pancha, let her go.

941
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,514
Goodbye, Mama!

942
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,398
Mujeres! Let's finish the order tonight!

943
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,426
We finished the order.

944
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,162
I wanted to repay Estela's loan.

945
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:34,130
So soon?

946
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:38,267
Papa, thank you so much
for lending Estela the money.

947
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:39,840
You're welcome, dear.

948
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,273
You are very welcome.

949
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,007
Papa, I...

950
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,109
I have something to tell you.

951
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,912
I don't know how to say this.

952
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,256
You have my blessing.

953
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,008
Why is everybody so quiet?

954
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:33,793
Sit down, please.

955
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,728
Ana has something to tell you.

956
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,739
Do you want something to eat?

957
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:29,282
- No thank you.
- I gotta go to work.

958
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,911
I thought you were going
to the airport with us.

959
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,215
I can't.

960
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,920
I wanted you to be there.

961
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,221
I gotta go to the factory.

962
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,895
You're gonna do great. Call me, okay?

963
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,829
I'm leaving, Dad.

964
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,328
Have a nice day.

965
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,197
Let's go, sweetie.

966
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,806
You're going to be late!

967
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,739
I'll wait for you in the truck.

968
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,611
Okay.

969
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,316
Mama?

970
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,824
I'm going now.

971
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,968
Don't you want to come out
and say goodbye?

972
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:34,841
Come on, open the door.

973
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:56,663
Come on, open the door.

974
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:22,490
Mama, come out and give me
your blessing, please.

975
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:32,602
Let's go, you'll miss the plane.

976
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,640
Good luck, cousin. Write from New York.

977
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:13,806
Okay?

978
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:18,817
We'll visit you.

979
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,066
That's me.

980
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,630
Don't worry about me.

981
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,142
You'll always be in my heart.

982
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,679
Thank you, Papa.

983
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,685
Take care, sweetie.

984
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:10,751
1, 2, 3, go!

985
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,218
- What?
- Go!

986
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,754
"1, 2, 3, go!"

987
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,312
- Start!
- I already said it!

988
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,590
I already said, "1, 2, 3, go!"

989
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,993
- Yes, but sing a song now!
- Which one?

990
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,191
- O Sole Mio.
- Again?

991
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,036
Don't you tired of it?
