00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:51,531
J-l-M?

174
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,444
When I was younger,
before I met your mother,

175
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:02,412
When I was younger,
before I met your mother,

176
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,917
there was a guy in New York
called Bill Willis just like me.

177
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:09,851
I never met him
or even heard of him.

178
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,720
But he went around signing my name
in all sorts of places:

179
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:17,056
Bars, restaurants,
some stores.

180
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:21,758
He even managed to steal a lot of money
out of my bank account.

181
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:24,198
Over $ 10,000.

182
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:28,602
- That was an awful lot
of money in those days.
- Did you catch him?

183
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,369
Yeah, finally. But by then,
he had already spent all the money.

184
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:37,642
- Did you put him in jail?
- Nah. I didn't press charges.

185
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:40,582
What if he had
a wife and kids?

186
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:44,280
- What if they were hungry?
- Oh, Daddy, you're so nice.

187
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:48,382
I'm too nice.
That's my problem.

188
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:53,897
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'll never do it again.

189
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:55,898
[Kissing]
Shh!

190
00:24:55,966 --> 00:25:00,596
- What did I tell you?
A soldier's daughter...
- Never cries.

191
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:12,438
Ah!

192
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,222
Billy.

193
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,458
How do you spell "gym"?

194
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:34,636
- G-Y-M.
- No fair. You told him.

195
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:37,538
I knew it anyway. G-Y-M.

196
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,940
Something happened today.

197
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,947
I met Billy's mother.

198
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:49,384
She called two days ago.
I didn't tell you.

199
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:53,389
- I had to hear what she
had to say for myself.
- And?

200
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:57,723
She said she researched me.
Meaning she read my books.

201
00:25:57,795 --> 00:26:02,494
- [Scoffs]
- And she said my writing
seemed brutal to her...

202
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,500
but honest.

203
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:07,594
I guess it's the honest part
that saved us.

204
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:11,698
- So is she signing or not?
- I don't know. Probably.

205
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:13,709
She's coming
with a lawyer.

206
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:17,178
She doesn't want to do it
in her office.

207
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,614
She says
it's too impersonal.

208
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:21,548
What's she like?

209
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:27,182
Attractive, brown hair,
uh, very poised.

210
00:26:27,258 --> 00:26:30,557
Seems to have made
quite an impression.

211
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,596
Nah, she's too cold,

212
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:36,190
too French,
too screwed-up.

213
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,997
She's not my type at all.

214
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:54,309
[Marcella] He won't see you.
He never looks up.

215
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:57,548
Once he's on his way,
he's on his way.

216
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,215
[Billy's Mother] It wouldn't
matter if he did.

217
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:03,954
He has no idea
who I am.

218
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:15,099
So, are you ready?

219
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:17,106
Are you?

220
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:19,574
I should be,
after all these years.

221
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:23,636
I promise you we'll give him
the best life we possibly can.

222
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:27,081
A better one,
certainly, than I can.

223
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:32,453
Maitre Matee will tell you.
He is also filing my divorce papers.

224
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:35,492
My second
divorce papers.

225
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:40,963
Not bad, no? He filed
the first ones too.

226
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:43,591
It's becoming quite a habit with him.
N'est-ce pas?

227
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,228
You're a writer.

228
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:17,666
So perhaps you'll understand
this foolish girl was only 15.

229
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,828
You may read it
if you like.

230
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:23,896
And one day,
if he wishes...

231
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:28,843
If he ever asks,
you will give it to him...

232
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:32,404
so he may know
something about me.

233
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:50,065
- Did you say black leather?
- With a gold clasp on the side.

234
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:54,036
- The girl, she's sweet.
- Peace, brother.

235
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:58,006
- She says that
every time a boy talks to her.
- Peace, brother.

236
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:02,478
It's not "he says." It's "he says."
And it's "brother," stupid.

237
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:06,073
Yeah, can't you hear the difference?
God, you two Frogs.

238
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,084
[Marcella] Come on, kids.

239
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:10,313
[Bill] I really like him
taking a crap alone...

240
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:12,685
on that steep hill
before theJap attacks.

241
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:17,284
But you can't put that in the movie.
The studio won't buy it.

242
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:22,663
I got him taking a crap because
it makes him vulnerable and unheroic.

[Horn Honks]

244
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:29,263
There's nothing glorious
or glamorous about the killing.

245
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:33,036
It's sloppy
and bloody and messy...

246
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,044
and...

247
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:37,273
You're never going
to get a chance.

248
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:39,144
Horrible
and eternal.

249
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:43,585
It's like nothing works
the way they told you it would.

250
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:47,112
It was a... You keep trying
to kill him, and he won't die.

251
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:50,160
He's like one of those monsters
in a monster movie.

252
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:53,663
You think he's dead,
and he keeps coming back after you.

and you still sing terrible.
- I'm bored.

- I'm so bored.
- Boring!

262
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,635
We can go down to the boardwalk
after dinner...

are there again tonight.

[Marcella] The doctor said,
"You're pregnant."

And I said,
"What? Me?"

282
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:33,535
It's God's own miracle
because every single doctor
on both sides of the Atlantic...

283

said I could never, never
get pregnant again.

You're starting to sound
like a broken record.

I had this terrible,
unbelievable time with Channe.

She had a huge head like my father's,
and there was so much scar tissue.

that I might just possibly
be a candidate for a cesarean.

- [Laughing]
- Bring us up... from 1940 to 1949.

840
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:52,642
[Bill] Sit down.

841
01:27:56,915 --> 01:27:58,883
What's it all about?

842
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,544
I told you at the football game.

843
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:05,111
They don't hate you.
They don't know what to make of you...

844
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:08,785
'cause you come
from somewhere else.

845
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:12,660
I guess that's my fault too.
I did some silly things, Dad.

846
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,434
Who were they?

847
01:28:18,503 --> 01:28:20,494
One's a basketball player...

848
01:28:20,572 --> 01:28:26,010
and one's a guy who works in his dad's
auto body shop after school.

849
01:28:26,077 --> 01:28:28,545
Like that.
They're okay.

850
01:28:28,613 --> 01:28:31,173
Are you okay?

851
01:28:33,418 --> 01:28:35,943
Was it nice for you?

852
01:28:40,091 --> 01:28:43,492
There was only one.
Sorta good with him.

853
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,660
With the others,
they're nice to me before,

854
01:28:47,732 --> 01:28:51,429
then afterwards, they don't
even wanna talk to me.

855
01:28:51,503 --> 01:28:54,563
I'm afraid they're gonna
call me the school slut.

856
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,107
To hell with 'em.

857
01:28:57,175 --> 01:29:00,440
Boys your age don't know
fuck all about sex.

858
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:04,881
They think when they've
slept with a girl, they've
put a fast one over on her.

859
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:08,043
Strut around gloatin'
to their friends.

860
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:12,783
- Were you like that too?
- Sure I was.

861
01:29:12,857 --> 01:29:15,587
Took me years to figure out...

862
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,857
when a girl slept with me
she wasn't rollin' in the dirt.

863
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:21,057
She was givin'me
something precious.

864
01:29:21,132 --> 01:29:24,499
- [Laughter]
- Will ya turn that goddamn thing down?

865

[Laughter]

866
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:30,640
All the way. No, no.
All the way up there.

867
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:35,976
- What am I supposed to do
with your brother?
- Billy won't say.

868
01:29:36,047 --> 01:29:39,949
You know, how he never
talks about anything.

869
01:29:40,018 --> 01:29:43,181
He hates this school
even more than I do.

870
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:45,313
If that's possible.

871
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:48,848
This move has been hard
on you kids, I know.

872
01:29:48,927 --> 01:29:51,452
I should be there more
for you,

873
01:29:51,529 --> 01:29:53,963
but this book's
drivin' me crazy.

874
01:29:55,633 --> 01:29:59,831
See, I'm as selfish
as anyone.

875
01:29:59,904 --> 01:30:03,067
All I think of is that
I gotta finish it...

876
01:30:03,141 --> 01:30:05,336
while I still can.

877
01:30:07,512 --> 01:30:10,913
None of us got no guarantee
on tomorrow.

878
01:30:10,982 --> 01:30:14,110
"Ask not for whom
the bell tolls" and all that.

879
01:30:17,288 --> 01:30:19,882
Now, you be smart about this.

880
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:24,554
Say no to those guys
till you find someone you really like.

881
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:27,996
Then come and talk to me.

882
01:30:28,066 --> 01:30:30,034
All right?

883
01:30:34,005 --> 01:30:35,939
Oh, baby.

884
01:30:37,709 --> 01:30:39,643
Baby.

- Hey!
- [Billy Groaning]

888
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:00,830
Get up.

01:31:00,898 --> 01:31:03,594
- Get up.

- Jesus, come on. Stand up.

891
01:31:08,606 --> 01:31:11,871
Lean on me. There you go.
There you go.

892
01:31:11,943 --> 01:31:16,312
- Man, what a scumbag.
- [Coughing]

893
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:19,350
I'm gonna kill that kid.
Take this.

894
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:21,408
- Forget about it.
- Just hold your nose.

895
01:31:21,486 --> 01:31:23,317
Keep your head up.

896
01:31:23,388 --> 01:31:25,356
How long
you been here?

897
01:31:25,423 --> 01:31:28,392
Uh, three months.

898
01:31:28,459 --> 01:31:30,393
It's not really
that bad...

899
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:33,897
once you get used to it.

900
01:31:33,965 --> 01:31:36,399
- You'll meet people.
- Yeah.

901
01:31:39,637 --> 01:31:41,901
- What happened?
- Nothin', nothin'.

902
01:31:41,973 --> 01:31:44,498
- Asshole Steve Bates hit him.
- I had my back to him.

903
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:46,668
I was looking in my locker,
and he came up from behind.

904
01:31:46,744 --> 01:31:50,271
He called me a Frog.
Can you believe that?

905
01:31:50,348 --> 01:31:53,215
This is Keith. He helped me.
This is my sister Channe.

906
01:31:53,284 --> 01:31:56,378
Nice to meet you. Thank you.
I saw you playing football.

907
01:31:56,454 --> 01:31:58,388
He snuck up from behind.
I was...

908
01:31:58,456 --> 01:32:01,289
If I'd seen him coming,
I could have fought back.

909
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:04,658
- Called me a Frog. I'm no Frog.
- Steve Bates hates anyone...

910
01:32:04,729 --> 01:32:09,189
who looks like they'll do more than
pump gas for the rest of their lives.

911
01:32:09,267 --> 01:32:12,065
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

912
01:32:12,136 --> 01:32:14,934
- I should be going. See you later.
- Thank you.

913
01:32:15,006 --> 01:32:17,770
I was scared he was
gonna bust my teeth.

914

Dad says always protect your teeth.
Don't tell Dad. Please.

915
01:32:22,146 --> 01:32:25,809
Just tell him I fell down or something.
He'll just get upset.

916

Billy, rake these leaves
when you get a chance.

No driving lesson today, honey.

Don't worry.
I'll be back home soon.

923
01:33:19,737 --> 01:33:22,729
Billy, you don't have
to rake it every day.

924
01:33:22,807 --> 01:33:25,970
Wait till
all the leaves fall.

- [Bill] And from this,

926
01:33:50,067 --> 01:33:53,366
I saw a semi-hallucination.

927
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:55,770
Spell "hallucination."

928
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,604
H-A-double "L," Dad.

929
01:33:58,676 --> 01:34:01,144
At least you've
learned to spell.

930
01:34:01,212 --> 01:34:02,708
And to type,
thank God.

931
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:12,079
[Bill On Tape]
I saw a semi-hallucination.

932
01:34:12,151 --> 01:34:15,814
All of him...
seemed to swell.

933
01:34:15,888 --> 01:34:19,380
Typing's the one thing
I learned in high school...

934
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:22,086
that was ever
any use to me.

935

I'm glad I can still
wring tears from my audience.

01:34:31,404 --> 01:34:34,396
It's good for sales.

939
01:34:34,473 --> 01:34:38,671
Aw, come on now, honey.
You know a soldier's daughter...

940
01:34:38,744 --> 01:34:41,304
Stop with
the "soldier's daughter" again.

941
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:44,178
Anyway, I'm not.
I'm a writer's daughter.

942
01:34:45,618 --> 01:34:47,779
Well, that's okay, then.

943
01:34:47,853 --> 01:34:50,083

getting bigger and bigger...

948
01:35:12,611 --> 01:35:18,015
and swelling and swelling
until he's bigger than the ocean.

949
01:35:18,084 --> 01:35:20,348
Bigger than the planet.

950
01:35:20,419 --> 01:35:23,946
Bigger than the solar system.

951
01:35:24,023 --> 01:35:26,958
Bigger than the galaxy
out in the universe.

[Billy's Voice] Dad, we moved
your things to the sun porch.

01:36:47,573 --> 01:36:52,374
[Bill's Voice On Tape] Feel the
cold... beginning to swell his hands.

01:36:54,713 --> 01:36:58,114
[Marcella] Oh, no, Bill.
You can't. Damn it.

958
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,751
This thing with Billy's citizenship's
driving me crazy.

959
01:37:04,824 --> 01:37:08,692
I must've written that damn congressman
five times already.

960
01:37:08,761 --> 01:37:11,161
He doesn't care
who the hell I am.

961
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:15,633
In America, Billy's adoption's
still illegal, no matter how we cut it.

- Let's go over their heads.
- Whose heads?

Whosoever it takes. My father
always said anybody could be bribed.

how things work here anymore.

of leavin' this thing unfinished.

Channe, I wanna
tell you somethin',

01:37:42,361 --> 01:37:45,660
but you have to swear to God
not to breathe a word to anyone.

01:37:45,731 --> 01:37:48,063
Are you sure
this is the right time?

971
01:37:48,133 --> 01:37:52,365
There isn't gonna be
a better time.

01:37:52,438 --> 01:37:55,737
You see, I been
offerin' to tell Billy...

the whole story about his adoption
for years now,

974
01:38:00,813 --> 01:38:02,678
but he doesn't wanna know.

975
01:38:02,748 --> 01:38:05,876
He just wants his citizenship.
Doesn't care about the rest.

976
01:38:05,951 --> 01:38:08,511
I thought that you were
getting him his citizenship.

977
01:38:08,587 --> 01:38:12,614
- We're tryin', honey.
- It's just that the whole
damn thing was so illegal.

978
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:16,354
We were so scared Billy's mother
would change her mind, take him away.

979
01:38:16,428 --> 01:38:19,955
I thought that
his parents were dead.

980
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:23,160
Marcella, will you
let me tell the story?

981
01:38:23,235 --> 01:38:25,863
No, they're not dead.

982
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:27,906
We never met his father,

983
01:38:27,973 --> 01:38:30,032
but we met his mother.

984
01:38:30,109 --> 01:38:32,134
She was 15
when he was born.

985
01:38:32,211 --> 01:38:35,374
- Fifteen years old.
- About your age.

986
01:38:35,447 --> 01:38:37,915
I've been offering
to show Billy...

987
01:38:37,983 --> 01:38:41,817
the diary his mother kept
while she was pregnant.

988
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:44,913
He doesn't wanna know,
period.

989
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:47,925
But one day he'll be curious,

990
01:38:47,993 --> 01:38:51,053
and it may be after I'm gone.

991
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,064
After I'm gone,

992
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:58,069
I want you
to read it, Channe.

So if he ever asks,
you'll be there
to tell him too.

The boy, Billy's father,

995
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:11,782
was her cousin, her cousin
by marriage or something.

996
01:39:13,385 --> 01:39:15,819
She'd known him forever.

997
01:39:35,741 --> 01:39:39,939
He was a few years older than she was
and had been around more,

998
01:39:40,012 --> 01:39:44,312
so she thought he was
some sort of god walkin'this earth.

999
01:39:44,383 --> 01:39:46,317
She worshiped him.

1000
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:53,517
The sweetest moments
of her life...

1001
01:39:53,592 --> 01:39:56,356
were when he was
bein' nice to her,

1002
01:39:56,428 --> 01:39:58,521
payin' attention
to her.

1003
01:39:58,597 --> 01:40:01,725
She hoped that if she did
whatever he wanted,

Right.
I don't usually have the car.

That's the social worker
who brought you the first day.

I knew she couldn't wait
to light up,

1137
01:48:26,852 --> 01:48:29,787
so I told her
to feel free.

1138
01:48:29,855 --> 01:48:32,016
See all these doodles?

1139
01:48:33,558 --> 01:48:36,925
That's because of you
and Channe makin' a racket...

1140
01:48:36,995 --> 01:48:39,725
while I was tryin'
to write.

1141
01:48:39,798 --> 01:48:42,232
If it'd just been Channe,
I'd have yelled at her.

1142
01:48:43,635 --> 01:48:46,001
But I could never
yell at you.

1143
01:48:47,072 --> 01:48:49,540
As you know.

1144
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:54,545
Take it.
Keep it safe somewhere.

1145
01:48:57,816 --> 01:48:59,750
Thanks, Dad.

1146
01:49:06,925 --> 01:49:09,086

his last one, you know.

1147

Last what?

1148

New Year's.

1149
01:49:16,535 --> 01:49:18,469
How can you say that?

1150
01:49:21,973 --> 01:49:25,033
You're so selfish.
You can't see anything but yourself.

1151
01:49:27,412 --> 01:49:30,074
It doesn't... matter...

1152
01:49:31,283 --> 01:49:34,684

with us tonight... or not.

in the whole world.

Maybe next year,
he'll be all right.

We'll all go out
dancin'together or somethin'.

1158
01:50:08,153 --> 01:50:12,715
- He's never gonna be all right.
- What are you talkin' about?

1159
01:50:14,626 --> 01:50:17,356
With what he's got,
you don't get better.

1160
01:50:17,429 --> 01:50:20,398
You either stay the same
or you get worse.

1161
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:24,191
- Turn back, Keith.
- What?

1162
01:50:24,269 --> 01:50:26,635
Just please turn back.

1163
01:50:26,705 --> 01:50:29,037
- I wanna be with him.
- Channe.

for Christ's sakes.
