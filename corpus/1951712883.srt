1
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:29,201
And everybody says the same exact thing:

2
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:32,762
"Don't wory Max,There is someone special out there for you"

3
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,595
What do they think,
I'm not trying?

4
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:38,765
You know Henry?
I don't think she exists.

5
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,482
And the truth is, If I did find her,
I don't think I'd know to do it anyway.

6
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,486
Max , Will you stop beating yourself?

7
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:46,409
I don't know how to date.
What is "DATING"?

8
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,640
I mean ,Look at those two.
Even that guy has a girlfriend.

9
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,645
I'm such a shmug.

10
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:56,606
The last thing you need right now is a girlfriend

11
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:59,162
Some chick missing with your head,
Going so cool with you.

12
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,689
Pretty soon ,She starts pulling
the same crap all women do .

13
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:03,851
So they think its thier mission to change us ,

14
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:06,688
Even though they'r the ones that screwed up .

15
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:09,131
You know ,like they'r all dressing "Oh,Sexy" to get your attention .

16
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,094
but then you follow one
of them from apart ,

17
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,248
And she slaps a restraining order on you .

18
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,329
You kidnapped your dog.

19
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:17,888
That's not the point.
The point is....

20
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:19,936
Before you know it ,she'd been...

21
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,536
nagging you into submission ,
and keepin you on a leech.

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,293
..so you'r away from your friends .

23
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,499
you know what the best part of a blowjob is?

24
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:30,493
Ten minutes of silence.

25
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,303
No man understands women...

26
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:45,255
It's like we genetically programmed,
to think differently.

27
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,538
Never mind.We have bigger problems.

28
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,384
Jonas has invited president Chumly,
to watch his test for Replicator today.

29
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,699
Oh, why he wants to do something stupid like that for?

30
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,580
Genetics conference is live in a week away ,
We're on the Replicator work ,..

31
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,106
So Jonas Is losing his mind

32
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:04,025
- Hey, Felix.
- Oh, Jesus.

33
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:07,663
what caught up your ass ?

34
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,553
just look at yourselves,
we're presenting our work to the president of the univercity ,

35
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,945
and you look like you just got out of your bed .

36
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,867
I did just got out of bed .

37
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,391
I'm very tired ,see ,having
spending a hundred hours a week in the lap...

38
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,157
for the last six months
to make sure my work is ready

39
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:23,037
What you've been up to ?
- He's been busy kissing Jonas's ass.

40
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:25,393
Ha ,ha ,ha .
We're gonna be late .

41
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:28,312
Why?Why he ,you see ,
like that ?

42
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,199
Ah.Hmm…

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,673
Now take a good look ,Sir,

44
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,959
because you wont believe your eyes ,otherwise .

45
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,762
It's true .What Dr. Fromer done
here, is absolutely amazing .

46
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:41,715
- Felix?
- Mm-hm ?

47
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:44,159
If you feel comfortable removing your nose ,face and head,

48
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:48,000
from Jonas's ass,
Henry can use some help with that .

49
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,919
At least one of us gives
Dr.Fromer the respecthe deserves .

50
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,236
Oh, that what it is ?

51
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,126
- don't make me...
- don't do!

52
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,562
Oh, that is so abnoxious!

53
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,480
A single drop of her blood…

54
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,401
contains all the genetic lnformation
we need .

55
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,245
We simply put it into the
Replicator, where it will combine with…

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,721
a special hormon-growth solution
that ,I have developed.

57
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,248
Okay,
Let's get to it .

58
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:14,330
-Yes .
- Okay .

59
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,445
This Better work .

60
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:23,134
Now president Chumly ,a simple drop of blood…

61
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:26,254
Or strand of hair ,contains all the genetic
lnformation we need.

62
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,089
then ,with the hyper Replicator…

63
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:32,576
we can circumventing
normal stages of development ,

64
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:35,612
and instantly create a full
grown adult clone .

65
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,816
- Here is the original.
- and Here is Fluffy.

66
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:03,739
I'll take this...

67
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:07,583
president Chumly ,meet :
Fluffy…Two.

68
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,979
Am hm, Fluffy two.

69
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:14,904
Oh, fantastic work, Jonas.

70
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,266
I was getting a little worried ,when i fought so hard

71
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,790
to get the international genetics conference here ,

72
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:21,022
That you gonna let me down .

73
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,388
But now , the world
will be stunned.

74
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,544
...When we present this .
You'll make Springdale Univercity famous.

75
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,547
You do better than that,
You will make it super famous.

76
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,995
I could not have done that
without your support, Sir .

77
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:36,955
If they could have done it .

78
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,426
I'm going to lunch with the Trust-Eve.
Why don't you join me ?

79
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,350
I'll be delighted ,Sir .
Thank you .

80
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:44,272
I'll be right there ,
just give me a minute with my staff .

81
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,792
super.

82
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:54,200
I want a full biological review done...

83
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:57,594
On that rodent .
cellular morphology…

84
00:04:57,763 --> 00:04:59,958
growth rate ,
brain wave function ,

85
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:01,921
Sexual viabiltiy
Everything.

86
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:05,202
A full biological…?
Well look ,she is fine .

87
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,675
As you may recall ,
we've done that with the last Fluffy two…

88
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:11,721
Untill she
mysteriously...imploded .

89
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:17,241
We need to present a perfect clone to the conference next week

90
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,320
And if we don't ,

91
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,045
Well you can forget about that associate professorship .

92
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,243
Been here for years .

93
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,604
I practically developed The hyper Replicator ,
You know that .

94
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,930
Jonas said he'd make me associate-professor ,
If i stuck fine ,

95
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:38,251
"Henry have stuck ?"
Oh ,I have stuck .
-You stuck .

96
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,650
If you do this...
I deserve a promotion .

97
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,051
And you will get it .
But there is no way he can deny you ,

98
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,212
After this presentation .
- if every thing goes all right .

99
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,129
Will you even buy attention in there ?

100
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:51,177
We can make enough Hamsters,
to feed every starving kid in Thailand .

101
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,091
Can't feed hamsters
to children .

102
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,011
Henry, any number of things can go wrong .

103
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:57,410
I mean , he is rush
to a senator's conference

104
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,811
I don't have time for a proper biological...

105
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:02,541
Do not focus on that lap .
You need to chill out ..

106
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:07,015
-Go out and find some hot chick to jack your penis into
-Oh , that't brilliant ,that's what i need .

107
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:11,382
- Yes…
- that's not what I need ,what I need is…

108
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,974
You have chosen wisely ,my son.

109
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,377
No ,no ,no.No

110
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,823
Henry ,end badly .
always is badly, everyone single time…

111
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,183
God ,she is just stunning .
- yes!

112
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:28,943
What could I possibly have in common with that woman ?

113
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,344
MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY

114
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,389
Oh, God.

115
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:43,103
You might just not hang out with your balls raw
'Cause you are not obviously man anymore ,

116
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:45,509
She is out my league ,Henry .

117
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,143
Girls like that date  pro-athletes or rock stars

118
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:50,471
What are you talking about ,"Rock Star"?

119
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:55,509
I'm just being a realistic man .
I'm a lab assistant.

120
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:59,313
This is nothing girls find exciting .Ever .

121
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:01,435
Excuse me .Hi .

122
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,874
Didn't i see you in
Dr. Fromer's lab this afternoon ?

123
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,952
-Yes .
-Yeah .Yes .

124
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,112
I am a huge fan of genetics.

125
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:12,479
Oh ,I'm Sorry .You guys Probably get that all the time .

126
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,521
Not as much as you think .

127
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,437
Well, I'm Kate Carson, and I'm doing a piece
on genetics …

128
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,640
for Modern Science of magazine .
I Interview …

129
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:23,757
Dr.Fromer this morning
about the Hyper-Replicator .

130
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,678
Well ,today is
your lucky day.

131
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,565
Because ,Max here  knows
everything about the Replicator.

132
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:32,083
- I'm sure he can fill you in .
- That would be wonderfull .

133
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,802
- and this is a clone?
- No ,this is just a beta test .

134
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,926
Ther have been a few kinks.

135
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,320
Well ,she looks healthy to me .

136
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,685
You …

137
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:45,768
How long you'v been doing this ?

138
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:49,044
Since I was five .Did you watch
"Scooby Doo" when you were a little ?

139
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:51,363
- Ofcourse I did.
- Okay.

140
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,407
Remember the one with the rich ,handsome ,oil tycoon…

141
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,492
Ask Velma out on a date ,and she curiously
peggerously declines?

142
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,163
- vaguely .
- Same episode ,Shaggy gets cloned .

143
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,646
And ever since I saw that,
I've been hooked .

144
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,809
I had to be the guy that ,
making cloning a reality .

145
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,976
And with this technology ,Kate ,
The possibilities are endless .

146
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:12,449
I mean ,we can save endangered species from becoming extinct...

147
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,338
we can grow human organs
for transplants ,

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,491
We might be able to cure cancer .

149
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,412
I'm going off .But the point is :
I love Genetics .i always have .

150
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:24,575
And I think I can make the world a better place .

151
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:26,813
I know exactly what you mean.
I mean ,I've wanted to be a journalist …

152
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:30,021
Since I was A kid.
And I always thought I can get…

153
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,102
Ouch !He bit me !

154
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,024
- Fluffy!
- Oh, my God is she okay ?

155
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:36,581
she is a little dizzy ,but she is fine .How is your finger?

156
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,345
It's fine .
It's just a little blood .

157
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:41,022
I think i'm gonna need a bandage .

158
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,258
I've got some in the first workstation , second drawer .

159
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:46,819
- Ok .Are you gonna be okay ?
- Oh, I'll be fine .

160
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:50,699
I ,Just had a little problem with blood.

161
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,664
But i'm sorry ,I should've warned you About Fluffy ,

162
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:57,108
that Fluffy is sort of adjusting To being alive .

163
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:59,582
Please don't even wory about that .It's fine .

164
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:02,029
Are you sure you gonna be okay ?

165
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:05,035
Yeah ,I'll be fine .

166
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,756
Oh ,God ,Is that clock right ?

167
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,186
I'm late .

168
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:15,231
I should've been on my way

You can't be Kate .
Because Kate is Kate .

215
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,877

Jill is pretty trendy .

216
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,790

00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,735
Well, well, well, I see you finally showing,

240
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,494
the kind of dedication i expect.
- Well, you'll be glad to hear,

241
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,050
that the Replikator is working perfectly.
I'm just dog tired,

242

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,299
It's 7:00 Am,Me wouldn't even be up yet .

251
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:43,030
it's important .I had a little accident at the lab last night .

252
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,944
Did you break the Replicator?
Did you sell Fluffy this time?

253
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,229
Remember Kate?The Modern Science goddess from yesterday?…

254
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,344
I cloned her.

255
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:59,349
Oh, Yeah.Ha,Ha.Very funny, man.
Ae h, you ain't even a reporter…

256
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:02,912
Or you'r just some old friendi
Rott in to put in this lime gag?

257
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,108
I'll tell you, when it comes to jokes, you are crap .

258
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:07,194
Henry!

259
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:13,233
Oh, Shit.

260
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,353
I still don't believe it,
a human clone.

261
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,350
You made a fully grown…

262
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:26,282
biologically correct,
extremely sexy…

263
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,752
human clone, Max!

264
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:30,562
Really illegal, Henry!

265
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:33,359
We'll go to jail.We'r so screwd!

266
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,481
What, we screwd ?
Fuck that .

267
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,955
Henry!I'm talking about the clone and I .

268
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,357
I can use some help here buddy, please.

269
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,883
Hm…

270
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:46,240
Yeah,sure.You ain't have to ask.

271
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:49,681
Right.
First of all, we must make sure..

272
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,727
that no one finds out.

273
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,603
She can't be a clone,
Unless there is an original,

274
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:56,239
and the original is in
Europe, Right?

275
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:58,767
Hatchom!

276
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:02,130
So all we gonna do is teaching her,
to behave like a normal person.

277
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,603
Unless, ofcourse she is a total morron.

278
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:06,566
No, she is not a total morron.

279
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,203
She just hasn't that time to simulate yet.

280
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,128
Her brain is perfect!

281
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,287
It's like
a sponge.

282
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:16,017
She can learn in a day what could normally take years.

283
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:18,732
She's a blank slate right now!

284
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:22,608
So..we could program her.

285
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,051
She is not a VCR,Henry,we're talking about .

286
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,774
We can make a woman ,

287
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:30,900
Who likes sports..
and action movies…

288
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:33,576
and hanging out in the Bars…

289
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:36,211
and not cats ,

290
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,574
or Winecollars or fool play.

291
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,502
You mean,make a woman,

292
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:42,735
Who acts exactly like a man .

293
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:47,417
Exactly.The perfect woman.

294
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:51,063
A woman,that man can actually understand.

295
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,947
What did you do that for?

296
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,418
I don't know.

297
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,184
I mean,yes,we have to assimilate her, but…

298
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,068
Stop it!

299
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,791
I suppose to certain extenize her duties,

300
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,704
_ Try to make a better human being.

301
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:07,100
Exactly.

302
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:11,226
Now, she shouldn't have time problems…
or be obssesed about her weight.

303
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:13,669
And she has to learn how to drive.
- Stick!

304
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,871
And football and Sunday
does not end…

305
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,066
Untill Monday night.

306
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,227
- This is perfect.
- Oh, there's so much stuff.

307
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,587
I don't even know where to begin.

308
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:26,074
My vow is for housebreaking.

309
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,352
That's nasty.

310
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,797
Oh,come on!

311
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,238
Here, these are books.
We learn things by reading these.

312
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:39,154
Television,however
Is much easier to use…

313
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,034
and much more fun.

314
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,512
Television.

315
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:46,403
- This is a home arcade system.
- very cool.

316
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:49,158
I've got 49 games that you can play on this,

317
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:51,720
48 of which,are sports games.

318
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:54,565
Some times,it is fun,
to watch one friend's puke.

319
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,877
- puke.
- this is toiletpaper.

320
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:00,603
This is hair.never spend more than five minutes styling.

321
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:03,886
- Definitly.
- May be ten.

322
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,842
this too,toiletpaper.

323
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,524
When you really on the pench.

324
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,768
- Jonas is an…
- asshole.

325
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:16,208
- When we see Felix, we…
-… kick him.

326
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,806
These are nipples.

327
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:20,288
- nipples.
- Now show me yours.

328
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:22,126
No, no,
you don't have to do that.

329
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,371
- come on.
- Stop it, Would you cut it out?

330
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:25,803
These are flowers.

331
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:28,689
Flowers are not important.
No.Bad.

332
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:30,448
movies with singing…

333
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,375
- Duh,crap.
-… unacceptable.

334
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:35,729
yes.seriously,
Size doesn't matter.

335
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,015
Run.I run,

336
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,336

337
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,258
lch run, you run, Henry run.
I get it already.

338
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,294
Are we gonna stay here all day?
Can we go do something fun?

339
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,574
Come on,give me a pass!

340
00:19:49,742 --> 00:19:51,619
Split fingers, Fast ball.

341
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:53,501
Got it?
- Got it.

342
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:55,456
All right.Throw to Henry now.

343
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,257
That's not Henry.

344
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,502

This is Pizza.

349
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:12,303

Nature Documentary.
If it's about sharks,or animals attacking people,

00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:07,958

368
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:24,001
Hey,look at you face.I've blewn you head off

369
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,843

Can you beleive i could keep this stuff up?

376
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,495
It's Incredible.

377
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:53,893
So I'm gonna keep teaching her what's important.

378
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:55,326
Oh,Yeah.

379
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,257
Oh,my God, my leg!

380
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:59,451
You know, i think i'm gonna go stop the car.

381
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,377
The "wedding Singulars" is good?

382
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:10,655
Oh,yeah.

383
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:12,894
The wedding is the best.

384
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,334
What's that?

385
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:18,303
That's called kissing.

386
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,179
It's what two people,who like each other do,

387
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:24,464
to show each other, that..
that they like each other.

388
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,859
I like you, Max.

389
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,384
I… I like you too, Kate.

390
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,347
But I don't think,
we should do any…

391
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,102
thing…

392
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:42,262
You taste like Peperoni.
I'm hungery.

393
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,786

395
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:54,995

00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:03,237
Got it bigger just this morning.

399
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:06,152
Well, that happens when a man finds a woman attractive.

400
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,038
Does these get harder too?

401
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,033
Aah!

402
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,840
- ah!
- Oh.

403
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:16,994
It's okay, It's okay.

404
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,121
Learning time is over.

405
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:22,360
So, good night.

406
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,122
Good night.

407
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:40,848
So that's what you do
with a Johnson.

408
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,645
Do you always have to do it in a hot tub?

409
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,603
Oh, no, you can do it where ever you like,
and at any time,

410
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:49,445
And with as many girls as possible.

411
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:51,404
You don't even have to know thier names.

412
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:53,643
Dammit.

413
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:55,565
What is wrong with you?

414
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,486
What are you doing?
Why you showing her that?

415
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,326
You said show her what is important,

416
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:01,253
and this is very important to me.
- Oh, come on.

417
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:04,493
Oh, well, watching all these Pornos
Makes me horny.

418
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:07,086

Hey, will you do some of this?

421
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:15,857
What we do think about,
We don't think about sex.

00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:27,655
Looks at that.
The defense is playing like shit!

00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:51,147
And there is that one thing
called the Blowjob.

432

00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,429
Hey!You know what?
We should probably…

444
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,273
ask another woman to join us,

445
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,238

Involving..Um,you know, emotinal attachement.

457
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,966
Less talking,More sex.

458
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:00,843
Valid argument.
There's still though,I mean numerous ethical Dominants ,

459
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,519
Inheriting the act,

460

00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:10,781
to see you.
- what, you?

521
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,426
What happened..you were flying.You were jetting…

522
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,500
No.Modern Science thought there may be a bigger story here

523
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:21,383
So,Jonas agreed to let me spend a week
in the lab,He's even renting me his guest room.

524
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:25,940
I'm going to be here untill your presentation.
Isn't that exciting?

525
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:27,782
More than you could possibly imagine.

526
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,663
What about your boyfriend?
Isn't he upset?

527
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:32,868
He is not my boyfriend anymore.
We broke up.

528
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,142
But he seemed like such a nice guy,very,very talented.

529
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,071
May be you should…

530
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:39,184
go back and give him a second chance,and patch things up.

531
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:43,029
I don't think that's gonna happen. After talking to you the other day,

532
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:46,233
I realised how truely important my work is to me.

533
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:48,193
And Derek just never got that.

534
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,791
It was time to break it off.

535
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,073
Is something wrong?
- No,

536
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:55,508
I just, ah,

537
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:57,670
I didn't think I was gonna see you again…

538
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,877
For the rest of my life.
- I just hope you guys don't get sick of me,

539
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,310
Because I'm gonna be around you guys 24 hours a day.

540
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,830
Ooh,look who finally decided...

541
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,873
to join us this morning..

542
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,961
I need you to look at Fluffy two.
Something is wrong with her.

543
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,512
With Fluffy?What's wrong?

544
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:21,677
This is all she does.

545
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,765
Well, I suppose if we look on putting all
the hamster production on one flew off the Cocko's nest,

546
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:28,403
We've been in pretty good shape,will we?

547
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:31,480
We have a genetics Conference in three days,

548
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,044
and we don't have yet a perfect clone!

549
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:38,642
So, nobody leaves this lab untill this problem is fixed.

550
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:41,086
Ah, Sir, I have very important business to take care of tonight.

551
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,567
Well,It's a shame ,

552
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:46,372
And though I thought you'd be quite dedicated to this job.

553
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:54,609
Hey, Max, if Fluffy is going all funny,

554
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:56,528
You think this has anything to do with… ?

555
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:58,766
No, She has a human brains,

556
00:30:58,936 --> 00:31:01,246
The most advanced learning device that ever known to man.

557
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:04,928
She is probably in home, memorizing the encyclopedia.

558
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,297
Yes!

559
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,179
Go, go…

560
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:20,382
So much for the Replicator, Huh?

561
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:24,059
Ah!Aua!

562
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,624
- My hormon-growth solution reminds …

563
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:40,428
gives me extra kick,if you will,to the growth medium
only the Kick if you want so.

564
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:42,944
And thus,with the
hyper+stimulated cell division…

565
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:45,027
… You can bypass the stages of normal cell growth…

566
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,021
to create an adult clone.
Impressive.

567
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,909
But how do you deal with the keytone shift…

568
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:52,502
Of the Mitochondrian variation
during rapid  Zellmitoses?

569
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,743
Well, I would mind abored you with …

570
00:31:56,953 --> 00:31:59,946
the technical jugg on,
Miss Carson,

571
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:02,953
because it's very,very complicated stuff.Oh,my Godness!

572
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,072
Ah, I wonder,
What is going on over there over there,

573
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:07,591
in the hamster research station.

574
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,072
Well, ti looks like fluffy two stopped running into the wall.

575
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:14,433
Yes,because she is not in her self
conscious,Sir,

576
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,351
Ah, Even after i put a helmet on her.

577
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,191
i think I figured out what's wrong.

578
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,789
The cloning process messes up the brain.

579
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,120
Fluffy two pain receptors actually formed as pleasure receptors.

580
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:28,234
Which explains, why she keeps pumbing her head Into the wall .

581
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:30,712
She finds the experience joyfull.

582
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:34,672
Felix, only you could come up with the scientific theory…

583
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,638
Involving the phrase:
Messes up the brain.

584
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:41,481
Now please, one of you
has actually learned something today?

585
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,115
Wait a second.

586
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:46,046
That's it, Sir.

587
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,721
learning.

588
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:49,720
there is nothing wrong with Fluffy two's brain.

589
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:51,641
She just hadn't had the experience yet.

590
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,562
She will learn how to behave…

591
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,368
from other members of her species.

592
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,926
We isolated this clone.
I think,

593
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:00,566
we should put her with other hamsters.

594
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:02,563
Are you saying, a clone made from this process,

595
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,485
Has the capacity to learn?

596
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:08,882
Yes, Sir,

597
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,649
It's exactly what I'm saying.

598
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:14,975
Jaah…

599
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:19,854
Heja!

600
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:21,849
ouch...

601
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:24,414
Max, you think i can get that interview?now?

602
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:28,016
No, but Felix will be more than happy to sit down with you.

603
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,536
We'll speak tomorrow.

604
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:33,454
So, Eh…

605
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:36,540
You seem like a really nice person.

606
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:52,666
Oh, Hi.I found this in your bed.

607
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,621
And I need some of these
Tit-restraining devices.

608
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,864
Wait a sec.

609
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:13,751
Hi.I'm Brandy.

610
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:16,269
How are you guys today?
- I'm working on it, Brandy.

611
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:18,226
How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

612
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:20,067
Is there anything I can help you with?

613
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:21,634
yeah.

614
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:23,554
We need a shit lot o' bras.
- Oh. Okay.

615
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:25,189
What size are you?

616
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,348
Oh.I don't know.
What's this look like?

617
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:32,874
Whoa! Sorry.

618
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,267
She is from, ah,

619
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,357
Hollywood.

620
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,278
Oh.

621
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,358
Ah, you look,
like a size 36 C.

622
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:43,793
Amm, I'll go check basic support,

623
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:45,879
and why don't you feel free to look around?

624
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,032
Thanks, Brandy.

625
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:49,433
Okay,

626
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,839
you can't show your boobs to everybody.

627
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:55,196
There are rules.
we'll talk about them.

628
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:57,124
Okay, this is,a ...

629
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:59,044
ah, this is a Thong.

630
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,965
girls like them.

631
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:04,365
I don't really understand why.

632
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,041
- Hey.
- Hey.Okay, this…

633
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,846
Try this on.If it fits,
we can get out of here.

634
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:18,129
Oh, so we already know each other a day,

635
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:20,563
and you already buying me a Lingerie?

636
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,247
Do you always move this fast?

637
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,922
Yes, always.very…

638
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:27,932
No, no, i don't.

639
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,972
I just enjoy shopping,
for Lingerie.

640
00:35:30,135 --> 00:35:32,206
i haven't an act for it.
- Oh.Yes, You do.

641
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,966
Listen,
I interviewed Felix .

642
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:37,935
But I understand that you are the one I need to talk to.

643
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:40,453
So, if you some time right now…

644
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,729
I would love to get this interview...
- Now is not so great.

645
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:17,182
- How do you know my size?
- I'm just a lucky guess.I'm a lucky guy.

646
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,466
What you say we try it on?

647
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,144
Not together,Ofcourse.

648
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,467
Carefull,there is a broken glass in here.

649
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,668
Okay,I know this is a shit lot of bra,but here.

650
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:28,584
Brandy, These are all dreadfull.All of them.

651
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:32,632
We need more.Could you get more?
- Okay.

652
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:35,228
Shopping is over.

653
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,147
Let's go.
- No,wait, I need some bras,

654
00:36:37,315 --> 00:36:39,750
and I don't wanna come here yet,everything tastes that.

655
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,629
- Fine.How is this?
- Okay, We'll test try...

656
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:45,510
No,Not here.You do that in the changing room,Okay?

657
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:48,186
- Okay.
- go to…

658
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:50,435
Oh, no.

659
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:03,157
Oh,What are you doing back? you're not supposed to be in here?

660
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,200
Ah um, I know.

661
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:07,713
Yes, but I found something else that I think you might like.

662
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:10,034
Oh, really?What?

663
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:13,595
- Ma'am, I think you gonna…
- This,I found this for you.

664
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,281
Wait a minute, this is much racier than the one I asked you for.

665
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,563
Well, There is nothing wrong with being a little racy.

666
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,960
- GO!
- I'll go.

667
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:28,690
- we are leaving.
- How is it look?

668
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,442
What hell happened?

669
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,211
It looks great.Let's go.

670
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:37,247
Why are you still here?

671
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:39,165
I told you you have to leave.

672
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,085
Yes, i heard you,
but I'm waiting for you.

673
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:44,644
Now go to where you are from ,

674
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:48,410
you're outta here,buddy!
- Yeah,I heard you.

675
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:55,249
- Listen to me, we gotta go.
- I'm coming!

676
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,176
Max!

677
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,417
thank you.Come on,Let's go.
Let's go.Let's go.

678
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,733
Sorry I rush you, you just look so good.

679
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:18,623
That I can't wait to get you home.
- We have a theorem, that if you're in a hurry,

680
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:21,345
Why don't we do it in the dressing room?

681
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:23,901
Hm?

682
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:27,066
Ha!

683
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:31,819
- Can you help this nice woman?
- Ah, you, you can't go in…

684
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:33,980
But I…But I…

685
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:38,106
Hi, I'm Brandy.
Can I help you?

686
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:01,348
Damn, I look good.

687
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,150
We have to go away.
Come on, come on!

688
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:09,516
- I'm not dressed.
- Please!

689
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,319
Whoa.
What's The capital of America?

690
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,915
- what's America?

- But you wanna do last night.
- I was drunk last night.

704
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:06,454
And vulnerable,
and you took advantage of that.

00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,529

I mean,I see you with the mall,

720

He said he was gonna join us.
- You asked Max to join us?

824
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:46,690
Yeah, It was all his idea.

825
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:49,321
Then there must be some..Max wouldn't…

826
00:46:49,493 --> 00:46:51,961
What's that for?
- To take the blood samples.

827
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:55,206
No, no,that's not necessary.
cause I was gonna wear a condom.

828
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:03,651
Why don't you just grap the hamsters,and we'll get started?

829
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:05,296
You wanna have these hamsters?!

830
00:47:05,497 --> 00:47:07,614
I don't know anyway to do without them.

831
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:11,937

832
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:14,893

Whoa.

836
00:47:42,388 --> 00:47:45,984
The original was the clone.
And which you thought was the clone, was the original.

837
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:49,148
The clone came to work when we were away,
but then the original came back,

838
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,903
And I've got to get the clone home now
before the original sees her!

839
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:54,189
- What was the first bit again?
- that, ah um, the clone…

840
00:47:54,392 --> 00:47:56,587
You were speaking to the clone.
- who is that?

841
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,148
- that is the original!
- But she wanted to…

842
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:01,914
- Just keep an eye on things!
- Okay.

843
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:03,871
Okay.

844
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:06,185
Max, there is something wrong with Fluffy two.She sounds sick.

845
00:48:06,395 --> 00:48:08,114
- Sick?
- What's wrong with Fluffy two?

846
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:10,034
- What's up ?
- I don't know.

847
00:48:10,236 --> 00:48:12,432
Well she seems like a little indigesting may be.

848
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:14,355
did you take samples?
- No,not yet.

849
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:16,276

- Okay.

851
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,993
Max,are you sure?I mean,What if there's
something wrong with the cloning process?

852
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,912
There is nothing wrong with the process.

853
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,912
Hello, everybody. Hi.

854
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:27,589
How is our project coming on?
- Fine, Sir.

855
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:29,753
This is a perfectly,
healthy clone.

856
00:48:43,206 --> 00:48:45,037
That is fuckin' awesome.

857
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:51,327
- What did you do?!
- Aaah!

858
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,327
I just stuck in the needle,

859
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:56,282
I knew she was sick!

860
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,970
So what does that mean?every clone we make is gonna explode.

861
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,323
Oh, no.Oh, no!

862
00:49:03,532 --> 00:49:06,366
Aah!Aah!

863
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:08,723
Sir,please,sir. please!

864
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:12,404
Oh, God,
you do not look so good.

865
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,772
I feel so good.
I feel like I'm gonna burst.

866
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:20,095
Oh,jesus.You are!Take cover!We all might die.

867
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:22,492
Everyone take cover!

868
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:28,330
We need a doctor immediately!

869
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,650
Sir,
there is others in front of you.

870
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,618
Mary Langner,
This is a matter of life and death.

871
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,697
That woman can
explode any minute…

872
00:49:35,821 --> 00:49:37,778
When she does,the whole building comes down with her.

873
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:41,140
I need every doctor you've got.
And possibly the bomb squad.

874
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:43,214
What's wrong?
Am I gonna be okay?

875
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:48,542
I think that's the last ever.

876
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:50,781
I think there's a little bit intestinals up here.
.

877
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,824
Actually, I believe that's a spleen.

878
00:49:54,026 --> 00:49:56,302
I don't care what it is,

879
00:49:56,507 --> 00:50:01,344
Just,clean it up.
Get it off the ceiling.If you don't mind.

880
00:50:01,509 --> 00:50:03,340
Where is max?

881
00:50:03,549 --> 00:50:06,701
Ah, He had an emergency to tale care of.

882
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,789
Oh, he had an emergency to tale care of, I see.

883
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,388
That makes all sense to me.
Do me a small favor.

884
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:16,824
If anybody hears from Max,
Would you give him a message from me?.

885
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:20,310
Would you tell him, to get
his ass back here!

886
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:22,267
Now!
- Okay.

887
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:34,954
Hydrogen Sulfat, Danger Explosive…

888
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,358
She's had a little bit too much soda,

889
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:46,672
but otherwise she's fine.
- So that's it?

890
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:49,801
I mean, that she's not going to explode?

891
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:54,037
Ah, no,no. In fact,
she is healthiest person..

892
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:55,962
I've ever seen in my life.
- really?

893
00:50:56,164 --> 00:50:58,599
Not enough of cholesterol, perfect x-rays,
every blood cell..

894
00:50:58,765 --> 00:50:59,960
seems to be brand new, …

895
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:02,481
Max, watch,
if I leave this thing longer,

896
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:04,000
my whole arm turns purple.
Look!

897
00:51:05,247 --> 00:51:08,160
No, she's not the brightest bomber,is she?

898
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:11,683
Hey,You know what's on tonight?Wrestling!

899
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:13,602
Let's order Pizza!

900
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:17,087
I don't want Pizza , okay?
I think I'm going on a diet.

901
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,122
We're starting a bite job.

902
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:23,604
Just once,I would love to sit down and,
I don't know...

903
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:25,684
talk!

904
00:51:25,893 --> 00:51:28,647
Hello, can you…
Can you talk to me?Can we do that?

905
00:51:28,854 --> 00:51:31,653
I do not think so, okay?

906
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:34,853
- that's not funny, Kate.
- I smell that cooking!

907
00:51:35,056 --> 00:51:38,208
We never talk.
I'm not just some thrusting,verile...

908
00:51:38,297 --> 00:51:41,096
Okay, okay.
Quite,Quite. Come on.

909
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,971
We can talk, okay?

910
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:48,258
We can have a nice happy conversation about…

911
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,096
- Ouch, that's a little rough!
-… Wrestling!Body Slam!I've got you now!

912
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:54,411
</i > This is Henry.Listen.< i>
< i>Your job is on the line.</i >

913
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:56,897
< i>Jonas is pissed that you didn't finally started going</i >
< i>You better call me.</i >

914
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:58,815
Dammit, Kate,
Would you get off me?

915
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:01,213
< i>Max, It's Kate.</i >

916
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,659
You know someone
else named Kate?

917
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:06,015
- Ah, I…
- who is she?!

918
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:09,019
Ouch!No one important, okay?!

919
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:12,259
- who is she?!
- She is the reporter,

920
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:14,657
I went to lunch with.
She is covering my work.

921
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:17,137
- Do you wanna screw up?
- we are just friends.Okay

922
00:52:17,348 --> 00:52:21,547
We didn't have a lot in common.
I just enjoy being with her.

923
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:23,786
So, that's a total waste of time.

924
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:27,227
Okay, tabby, comes.
Enough for a threat.

925
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:29,548
Time for some sex!

926
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:32,989
Not tonight,
I have headache.

927
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,546
Auu!

928
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,427
Max , How did it go last night?
Any more problems with Repli-Kate?

929
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:42,348
Problems?
All I have is problems.

930
00:52:42,515 --> 00:52:46,111
Wet still have to move the Replicator
to the auditorium for the Presentation,

931
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:48,433
We've no idea what happened to poor Fluffy two,

932
00:52:48,517 --> 00:52:51,874
And I have an insane clone, literally,
destroying my appartment.

933
00:52:52,078 --> 00:52:53,797
She's developed into a reality problem,Henry.

934
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:55,717
What you mean?

935
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:57,876
Waht I mean,I think we made a mistake.

936
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,839
We should've exposed her to
a few feminine influences.

937
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:02,793
Like what?Dishing?

938
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:06,398
I'm seriuos. I'm hanging out with Repli-Kate,
and she is acting just like a guy.

939
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:09,600
But it is not as good as we
thought it was going to be.

940
00:53:09,763 --> 00:53:11,720
I'm begining to wonder,
what women even seen us …

941
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:13,642
Dude, Wat's your problem?
She is a woman,

942
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:16,518
Who acts like a man,
It's what every man wants.

943
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:18,762
No,It's what every man says he wants ,

944
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:21,800
May be all the things we don't
understand about women…

945
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:24,726
All this little korks they drive us crazy,
may be this is  more important than we realize.

946
00:53:24,888 --> 00:53:28,848
Repli-Kate listens, but she doesn't hear me.
She's completly self-involved.

947
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:31,439
I don't know, she just hasn't date…
I feel like I'm dating.....

948
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,367
me....

949
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,364
I'll never get that lucky.

950
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:39,405
What do you think what happens
if the real Kate found out?

951
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:41,091
Don't even say that.

952
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:44,006
Don't you think she has the right to know?

953
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:46,893
Oh, you ldiot.
Two identical women,

954
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:50,883
and you fall for the one
that blew you in a bar.

955
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:56,168
Carefull with that.
That is expensive.

956
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:58,693
do you understand me?You get it, expensive,
cost a lot money.

957
00:53:58,898 --> 00:54:00,650
- Is Kate here?
- Yeah,over there.

958
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:02,571
That's not gonna fit
through those door, Felix.

959
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,458
Hey, what happened to you yesterday?
I've tried to reach you.

960
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,054
I'm so sorry I didn't call you back.

961
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,649
I've been,I had to rush a friend of mine
into the university infirmary.

962
00:54:10,821 --> 00:54:12,574
I hope I'm not interrupting, but I…

963
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:16,053
just heard something very funny,
and I thought I'd share it with you,my friends.

964
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:20,860
Evidentally,it was discovered that
the reason Fluffy two exploded...

965
00:54:21,064 --> 00:54:24,182
was because someone in here
fed her Hydrogen Sulfat.

966
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,940
Now,here is the funny part…

967
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:30,617
It was discovered by miss Carson,
Who was not a geneticist by profession.

968
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:33,626
And yet seems to know more about
what's going on this lab…

969
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:38,783
Than you two,
pathetic excuses scientists.

970
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:43,621
I have a presentation in 24 hours, and just yesterday…

971
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:49,230
we have disquit the guest honour
off the walls with a shammy.Now!

972
00:54:49,392 --> 00:54:52,271
This Replicator has to be moved,
a new clone made…

973
00:54:52,433 --> 00:54:54,629
and a new set of data derived.

974
00:54:54,754 --> 00:54:59,226
If this is not done,if this presentation
is in anyway compromised,

975
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:02,035
then you will not only be out of the job tomorrow,

976
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:04,995
But I will see to it you will never work in this field again.

977
00:55:05,157 --> 00:55:07,148
Do you dig it?!

978
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:10,151
Sir, if you thinking,by threatening me,
you can force me..

979
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:12,349
to be your slave,well…

980
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,472
You can't shit.

981
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,793
Max , I have…

982
00:55:19,961 --> 00:55:22,635
Oh, miss Carson, I don't think Max
needs any more distractions from you.

983
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:25,562
Now,why don't we discuss
the nights lnterview with my home.

984
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:29,000
Dude,you'll be here all night.
Repli-Kate's gonna freak.

985
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:31,394
No,she won't,cause you
gonna be keeping an eye on her.

986
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:33,840
- what?
- Just, give her two Sixpacks..

987
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:36,560
of Burger and several
hours of cartoons.

988
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,679
Okay.

989
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,960
Hi.Uh…

990
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:46,597
- Hi, Mary… Langner.
- hello.

991
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:50,080
I'm from the biomedical labs
here on Campus.

992
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,566
I understand you treated a friend of mine,yesterday.

993
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:55,844
She came came with someone
named Max Flemming.

994
00:55:56,012 --> 00:55:59,528
Oh, a tall girl,good looking, no insurance?

995
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:02,048
That's her.

996
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:04,409
Yes.

997
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:06,571
Hey.

998
00:56:06,735 --> 00:56:08,646
Amm, the eighth grade…

999
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:10,568
was fascinatingfor a number of variations.

1000
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:12,374
yeah,this is so amazing.

1001
00:56:12,576 --> 00:56:15,137
And you've given me such wonderfull information...

1002
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:16,896
It's almost overwhelming.

1003
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:20,694
I should probably get some rest
before the big day tomorrow.

1004
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:24,415
Oh,yes, I do have a speech to prepare myself.

1005
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,579
Yes,you do.And I'm gonna let you to that....

1006
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:30,336
So,thank you so much.
Well,good night.

1007
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,616
Wanna a beer?

1008
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:39,617
- I'm not in the mood.
- What's up?

1009
00:56:39,784 --> 00:56:41,298
It's Max.

1010
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:43,695
First ,I thought we was cool and all.

1011
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:47,416
But he's just gone wierd on me.
He doesn't wanna play video games,

1012
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:51,257
He doesn't wanna watch sports,
He's on a diet!

1013
00:56:51,468 --> 00:56:53,823
Yeah, I didn't know he was
starting to ounch up a bit.

1014
00:56:54,028 --> 00:56:55,747
Yeah,And he's not putting out, so…

1015
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:59,704
What?You mean you two on…

1016
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,339
We did it once,and that was two days ago.

1017
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:07,228
See,all I want is just have a lot of casual Sex without
getting bugged in a relationship.

1018
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:11,352
But it's just he had these issues with it.

1019
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:14,266
What's up with that?

1020
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:16,386
I don't know.
I mean,I've always said:

1021
00:57:16,595 --> 00:57:19,110
You wanna shag someone,shag him.
What brings emotions to it,eh?

1022
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:22,195
Dude, Exactly.
It is not natural,

1023
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,991
to have sex with the same person.And I'm young.

1024
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,388
If somebody wants to have sex with me,
I think,

1025
00:57:27,558 --> 00:57:29,311
I should have sex with them.

1026
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,358
Yeah,specially when Max is so into …

1027
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,198
What did you say?

1028
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,357
Oh, nothing.

1029
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,239
This is bullshit.

1030
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:41,314
So he can have sex with somebody else,
and I can't.

1031
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:47,474
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1032
00:57:47,684 --> 00:57:49,118
What are you thinking?

1033
00:57:57,527 --> 00:58:00,759
I'm sorry to bother you so late,Sir,
but I have something may be you really need to see.

1034
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:04,444
Have you seen this?That woman
Has given Max full credit…

1035
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:07,249
for the Replicator!

1036
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,729
Okay, but I …

1037
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:10,922
After all I've done for that kid,
And this is how he rebays me?!

1038
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:13,811
If this goes to print,
I'm finished!

1039
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:15,724
I'm not so sure about that.

1040
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,849
You gonna take a look at this.

1041
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:29,487
Why the long face?

1042
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:33,536
I just wanted to hel people,Kate
That's all I've wanted to do.

1043
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:35,456
And now it seems like....

1044
00:58:35,658 --> 00:58:38,219
every single thing I touch,
turns to complete shi…

1045
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:40,695
I can't stop screwing up.

1046
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:44,615
Max , listen.Every great
inventor screwed up

1047
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,096
It took Edison over thousand attempts,
to create…

1048
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:51,222
the light bulb .If you don't make mistakes,
you'll never learn.

1049
00:58:51,343 --> 00:58:53,493
How much of the Repilcator was your idea?

1050
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,098
That's hard to specify,I mean,
Jonas fill all the paper ,

1051
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:59,058
and Felix does a pretty job bringing Bagels in the morning ...

1052
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:01,535
- public figure.
- 90 percent.

1053
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:04,618
Max,listen to me,you are going to help people.

1054
00:59:04,827 --> 00:59:10,346
You know, may be one day,you might
even take credit for your own work.

1055
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,944
- This can't be.
- It is,...

1056
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,345
That's the charts for the woman
Max took to the hospital,

1057
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:20,542
Here's the charts for Fluffy two.

1058
00:59:26,553 --> 00:59:30,024
- find this woman, tonight!
- I'll do my best, Sir.

1059
00:59:32,074 --> 00:59:33,827
…Mention "Left me"...

1060
00:59:33,995 --> 00:59:36,385
And for years,
I've dreamed we could get back together.

1061
00:59:36,596 --> 00:59:38,348
And may be get married.

1062
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:41,236
But It never did,
because of the fucken dog.

1063
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:43,753
Enough with the murder mouth.
Are you ready to go again yet?

1064
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,314
Again?
It's been five years, you know?

1065
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,987
There is a limit to how long a man can go!

1066
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:50,832
- oh, really?
- Yeah.

1067
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,231
- I'm outta here.
- what?

1068
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:56,712
Besides, We're out of beer.

1069
00:59:56,922 --> 00:59:59,881
All I need is ten minutes ...

1070
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:02,113
And I'll be fine!Kate!

1071
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,075
Oh,my Godness.

1072
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:14,401
She's perfect.

1073
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,877
She sure is.

1074
01:00:18,928 --> 01:00:21,568
So,the woman that called you in the lab the other day,

1075
01:00:21,729 --> 01:00:23,481
Was she an Ex-girlfriend?

1076
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,206
Ah, sort of.

1077
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:31,010
What was she like?

1078
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:34,569
She was surprisingly like you…

1079
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:36,650
In a lot of ways,

1080
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:40,085
Too much like me in all the others.

1081
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,889
- To tell you the truth, she is…
- So you're not seeing anyone?

1082
01:00:49,017 --> 01:00:50,575
No.

1083
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,095
Excuse me!

1084
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,696
Excuse me!

1085
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:07,338
Have anyone seen a girl just gone,
That wants to have sex all the time?

1086
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,056
Yeah,she's in the back..

1087
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:11,942
With the Easter Bunny
and Santa Claus .

1088
01:01:12,104 --> 01:01:13,537
She better be not shagging them.

1089
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:26,462
Kate?Kate!

1090
01:01:26,628 --> 01:01:28,584
I'm just com here to surprise you .

1091
01:01:28,788 --> 01:01:31,508
Well,you did.
Who the hell are you?

1092
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,428
Oh, are you still mad of me?

1093
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:36,304
You, you look amazing.
Did you do change your hair?

1094
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:38,706
No, it just got messed
while I was banging Henry.

1095
01:01:38,911 --> 01:01:41,107
Ah, you slept with another guy already?

1096
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:43,031
It didn't take very long, Kate.

1097
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,622
No,shit.It lasted
two minutes stops.

1098
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:48,302
What you're doing is did it back to me......

1099
01:01:48,514 --> 01:01:50,710
Because you pissed that I screwed on you?
- No.

1100
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,555
I'm doing this to get Max for sleeping around on me.

1101
01:01:53,716 --> 01:01:56,469
Ma… Max?
You slept with two guys?

1102
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:59,475
Yeah, and I'm looking for more.

1103
01:02:01,758 --> 01:02:03,989
Okay, all right, baby,
You made your point.

1104
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,079
I cheated on you, I was on tour, and
I was wrong,

1105
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,358
And I'm sorry. Okay?
But they were groupies, baby.

1106
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,597
It's not a thing with real women.

1107
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:16,151
I don't care who you sleep with,

1108
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:20,151
What, you don't care,

1109
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:22,753
If I'm having sex with other women,
while I'm having sex with you?

1110
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:25,320
Wait, you mean like threesome?

1111
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:29,155
No!I will be totally into that.

1112
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:31,597
I..I get off a ten.

1113
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:35,477
I know where to go.

1114
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:38,447
- That's what I feel.
- Me too,me too.

1115
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:50,889
Thank you, Kate.
Thank you for tonight.

1116
01:02:51,092 --> 01:02:55,531
And for everything you said.
I really needed that.

1117
01:02:55,694 --> 01:02:58,892
Do you know the real reason I broke up with Derek?

1118
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:03,811
Amm, because…
he was holding you back

1119
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:06,809
from doing what you really wanted to do

1120
01:03:06,977 --> 01:03:10,209
No?
- No.

1121
01:03:10,378 --> 01:03:15,692
Because he was in a million years,
he'd never do anything as sweet as this.

1122
01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:45,625
Hey, beautifull.

1123
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,666
Do you really move when I ask you to join a threesome?

1124
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:50,543
Ah umm.Yeah.

1125
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,019
You know, I got my ride waiting out,

1126
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,949
He's dumb, but he is hot.

1127
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:57,541
Could we make that a foursome?

1128
01:03:57,712 --> 01:03:59,509
Oh, absolutely .
The more, the merrier.

1129
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:01,425
Let's go.

1130
01:04:01,593 --> 01:04:05,507
Excuse me please.Kate, wait!

1131
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:08,787
Kate!

1132
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:15,995
- No, wait.
- what?

1133
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:18,428
We shouldn't do this.
If Jonas finds…

1134
01:04:18,598 --> 01:04:22,274
No.He won't. He is in his office,
practicing his speech.

1135
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:24,395
Besides, I don't want you to go.

1136
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:29,350
Come.

1137
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:33,317
You go ahead, make yourself comfortable

1138
01:04:35,403 --> 01:04:37,837
And while I'm refreshing up.

1139
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,924
He can't get angry at me
for not finding her,

1140
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:57,804
This is a big town, I'm just one guy.
She's not gonna just fall on my lap.

1141
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:03,566
So, you're staying there?
The stay address your author gave me?

1142
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,449
Yeah, that will do.

1143
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:27,615
What is going on?

1144
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:30,572
We are allowed to be here, right?

1145
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:32,809
Oh, who gives a shit?
Go find a bedroom.

1146
01:05:32,979 --> 01:05:35,210
Go, bedroom.

1147
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:39,855
Hi.

1148
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:42,616
Let's get this show on the road, girls.

1149
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:44,819
Yeah.Come on.

1150
01:05:53,105 --> 01:05:55,904
He finally came to accept this.

1151
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:00,705
Oh.Kate.Wow.

1152
01:06:00,907 --> 01:06:04,822
Mamma.Listen, Kate, ah umm…

1153
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:09,745
I could not dreamed of this whole thing any better,

1154
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,708
But there is something that I absolutely have to tell you …

1155
01:06:11,871 --> 01:06:15,547
Enough talking.
I have a surprise for you.

1156
01:06:36,278 --> 01:06:38,030
Oh, what the hell?

1157
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:49,673
Hello?

1158
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,918
Kate?

1159
01:06:52,122 --> 01:06:53,875
I'm back.

1160
01:07:00,045 --> 01:07:02,513
Jonas, Jonas.

1161
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,435
Jonas, are you around?Jonas!

1162
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,957
I found her, Sir!

1163
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:13,678
Sorry,Sir.She's downstairs.

1164
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:31,331
I love that spot.

1165
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:33,291
It's like you know me already.

1166
01:07:35,335 --> 01:07:37,087
You know, usually I don't do this so fast,

1167
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:41,375
but the last guy with this,
he sucked in bed.

1168
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:45,207
I'll go find the bedroom.

1169
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:47,613
I'll be right there.

1170
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,410
Go on ahead,
I'll be right there.

1171
01:07:58,222 --> 01:08:00,053
Ouch!

1172
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:23,146
Thank you.

1173
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:30,587
This is redicilous.

1174
01:08:32,752 --> 01:08:34,504
Oh…

1175
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:36,550
Wow.You are aside  as I'm.

1176
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,465
Nice trick.

1177
01:08:38,633 --> 01:08:41,990
Oh, my God.

1178
01:08:42,154 --> 01:08:44,225
- Max!
- Now, Felix!

1179
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:55,468
Take that ,bitch!

1180
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,955
Could you be any more incompetent?

1181
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,998
Give me a hand.

1182
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:15,920
Oh, my God!

1183
01:09:16,084 --> 01:09:19,521
- Oh yeah,my better.
- Oh, yes!

1184
01:09:19,725 --> 01:09:22,923
Oh, God,
I think I'm gonna explode!

1185
01:09:23,086 --> 01:09:25,442
- Henry, is that you?
- who the hell is Henry?

1186
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:27,359
Whoa, whoa, is there somebody else in here?

1187
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:28,722
Yes!

1188
01:09:28,888 --> 01:09:31,278
Oh, my God!

1189
01:09:31,449 --> 01:09:34,088
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, it's Derek Waters from Green Snake!

1190
01:09:34,249 --> 01:09:36,241
- Hey, what's up?
- Where the hell is Kate?!

1191
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,806
I was with Kate! She was with me.

1192
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:41,446
You and Kate?l was with Kate!
Who the hell are you ?

1193
01:09:41,652 --> 01:09:43,324
Whoa, whoa!
If you all there,

1194
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:45,370
Who is licking my balls?

1195
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:49,082
Uuuh!

1196
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:51,210
Uuh!

1197
01:09:51,414 --> 01:09:53,292
Kate!Kate, where are you?

1198
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,970
Kate!Shit!

1199
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:12,175
Oh, Shit.

1200
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:15,054
- No,shit.
- You cannot do this to us, Jonas.

1201
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:17,730
I'm not responsible for your situation,

1202
01:10:17,902 --> 01:10:19,780
Max is.He cloned you.

1203
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:23,579
I'm simply looking out for your best interrests.
- By kidnapping us?

1204
01:10:23,704 --> 01:10:27,414
You always wanted to be in science,
oh,now you are science.

1205
01:10:27,585 --> 01:10:30,817
You feel it lucky.Punk?!

1206
01:10:30,986 --> 01:10:33,103
Kate!

1207
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:48,465
This is absolutely incredible.
She is a perfect clone.

1208
01:10:48,631 --> 01:10:52,307
Sir, these women seemed kinda scared.
You sure this is the best way to handle..?

1209
01:10:52,472 --> 01:10:54,464
Don't be so thick headed.
The potential of this research,

1210
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:57,592
was always to clone a human being.
And now, that Max drop us one…

1211
01:10:57,674 --> 01:11:00,188
on our laps,
You won't let her go.

1212
01:11:00,395 --> 01:11:02,545
Those are no longer women in there,

1213
01:11:02,635 --> 01:11:04,991
They're founds for information that
must be mined for science.

1214
01:11:05,196 --> 01:11:07,950
Now,I've gotta go rehears my speech.
You stay here.

1215
01:11:08,117 --> 01:11:10,916
Nobody goes in or out of that lab
except me, understand ?!

1216
01:11:11,118 --> 01:11:12,915
Yeah.

1217
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,831
Put a line!!

1218
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:23,829
May be next prepare your hands…

1219
01:11:28,363 --> 01:11:31,720
You stay away from me.

1220
01:11:32,884 --> 01:11:35,194
- What's up?
- Jonas has the Kates.

1221
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:39,439
And he has revised his presentation,
in order to frame us.

1222
01:11:39,606 --> 01:11:44,522
Oh,that dick!

1223
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:46,480
The moment those two girls walk
across the stage tomorrow,

1224
01:11:46,648 --> 01:11:49,322
They'll become lab-rats for the rest of their lives.

1225
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:51,366
Yeah, we gotta call the cops.
Where is the phone?

1226
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:54,084
And say what,Henry?
That somebody stole our clone.

1227
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:56,885
We don't even know where they are.

1228
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,361
We know precisely that ...

1229
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:02,132
they'll be tomorrow at 9:00 am.Presentation.
- Right.So what do we do?

1230
01:12:02,293 --> 01:12:05,365
We use this.

1231
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:07,570
Pubes?

1232
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:12,328
That …Oh,yeah.

1233
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:16,371
Max , that bastard.
How could he do this to me?To us?

1234
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:18,289
I don't know.

1235
01:12:18,457 --> 01:12:20,210
Besides he's nagging and wagging…

1236
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,257
He was kinda cool to me.
I'm fine with him.

1237
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:26,092
That doesn't make what he did any less wrong.

1238
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:29,531
He created you,so to a relationship with.

1239
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,579
And why was he so interested in being with you?

1240
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,662
Get out of here!

1241
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:05,310
What?I'm sorry?

1242
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,547
Get out of here!Now!
- But I thought…

1243
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:09,543
Get out, Get out!

1244
01:13:10,392 --> 01:13:12,349
Get out, Get out!

1245
01:13:16,794 --> 01:13:19,992
Good clone,Jonas.
Such a good clone.

1246
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:22,067
I think that went pretty well…

1247
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,988
It was hell of training him a five whole words.
- Penis.

1248
01:13:24,156 --> 01:13:26,910
- Ah, six words.
- You shouldn't have taught him that.

1249
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:32,352
Son of a…Don't worry,
we'll get you out of here!Right now!

1250
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:34,754
Stay there, stay.

1251
01:13:34,919 --> 01:13:36,797
Tou have a lot of explaining to do.

1252
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,191
I cloned you by accident.
I know it's not an excuse,

1253
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:42,593
but it is the truth.
Yeah, I did terrible thing,

1254
01:13:42,762 --> 01:13:45,436
but I'm not like Jonas.
I'm still the guy was last night ,

1255
01:13:45,603 --> 01:13:49,802
The guy,who is completely in love with you.
And will do anything for you.

1256
01:13:50,404 --> 01:13:53,283
Could you be any sappier ?

1257
01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:55,914
The girls actually falls for this shit?

1258
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:58,395
I screwed up.

1259
01:13:58,566 --> 01:14:01,365
Kate, I cloned you by accident.
I know it's not an excuse...

1260
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:04,446
I heard you.But I see still have
a thing for cloning people.

1261
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:06,679
l don't know,
I didn't know any way else to do.

1262
01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:09,569
As soon as Jonas tell the world
that you're a clone and she's a clone…

1263
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:11,880
- just get me out of here.
- All right.Sorry.

1264
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:15,242
You gonna be a research
project for the rest of your live.

1265
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,647
Yeah, I know you hate me right now…
I'm not even blaming you.

1266
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:20,686
But if we get out of here,
we've got to work together.

1267
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:25,692
Okay, what do we do?

1268
01:14:25,854 --> 01:14:29,484
We just had to get you out of here
before Jonas makes his speech.

1269
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:32,414
Where is Repli-Jonas?!
- Oh,punk.

1270
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:36,331
Find Repli-Jonas, stall him!
Do not let him get to the stage!

1271
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,218
Oh, here he is.Excuse me.

1272
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:51,620
Where are you?I've got a room
full of people,waiting to see you.

1273
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:55,293
Whenever the front..
When ever…

1274
01:14:55,463 --> 01:14:58,262
the frontiers of genetics are explored…

1275
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:03,096
Felix!Felix!

1276
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:10,779
If memory serves me correct, I thought I had asked you
to stay back at the lab and guard the Kates.

1277
01:15:10,987 --> 01:15:14,139
And so, a question comes to mind .
And you know what that question is?

1278
01:15:14,308 --> 01:15:16,664
- Ah umm, no.
- Why are you here?

1279
01:15:16,869 --> 01:15:20,306
- Oh, Sir,I wouldn't have guessed…
- Zip it!

1280
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:23,224
Now why don't you go back to the lab and stay there,
untill I tell you to leave.

1281
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:26,145
You can do that for me,can't you?
Can you do that for me?

1282
01:15:26,312 --> 01:15:28,542
You can do it,right?
Do it!!

1283
01:15:28,713 --> 01:15:30,465
Okay, guys,
guys, come.

1284
01:15:30,633 --> 01:15:33,751
She sells,Sea shells,She sells,Sea shells…

1285
01:15:33,914 --> 01:15:36,224
This is Giovanni Bellini,
president of largest…

1286
01:15:36,435 --> 01:15:38,426
Genetics research company
in Rome, Gene-ltalia.

1287
01:15:38,595 --> 01:15:41,429
I'm a big fan of your work
I'm very excited to see this today.

1288
01:15:41,596 --> 01:15:44,634
- Get out of here!
- No,seriuosly. I'm excited .

1289
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:52,793
And, ah, this is max, Dr. Fromer's
chief research assistant.

1290
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,837
Oh, you must be great,
working with a genius like Dr. Fromer .

1291
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,710
Oh.I'm here because of Dr. Fromer.
He made me what I'm today.

1292
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:02,114
I'm here because of Dr. Fromer.

1293
01:16:02,282 --> 01:16:04,274
He made me what I'm today.

1294
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:07,277
I have a very important question to ask the doctor.

1295
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:09,679
If you can excuse us.

1296
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:12,035
Such fun of the staff.Parbequeue

1297
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:15,801
First he tells me to watch the Kates,
then he tell me not to watch the Kates,

1298
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:19,602
Then he says to watch them again.
And I'm gonna get some trouble

1299
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:21,041
They're out!

1300
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:23,802
Get up!Go!

1301
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:27,080
Go that way.

1302
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:36,241
- You guys go that way.
- Okay.

1303
01:16:42,774 --> 01:16:44,413
Hey, Katie Katie Katie.

1304
01:16:44,615 --> 01:16:48,165
Where you are, Kate?
It's just me, Felix.

1305
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:50,611
Hey, hey, go that way.

1306
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:03,212
Who's your mamma now?

1307
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,218
It's okay.

1308
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:08,100
Nothing to be afraid of, Kate.
Come on out.

1309
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:10,651
- Yah!
- Uh!

1310
01:17:15,704 --> 01:17:16,978
Kate?

1311
01:17:17,144 --> 01:17:20,342
Oh, Jonas.Guess what?
Your clones escaped.

1312
01:17:20,505 --> 01:17:22,656
I won't be so sure about that!

1313
01:17:27,027 --> 01:17:28,096
Get her!

1314
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,029
How is there in Beirut?

1315
01:17:45,192 --> 01:17:47,661
Whenever the fronteers
men of genetics…

1316
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,551
go exploring,

1317
01:17:49,714 --> 01:17:52,592
They can encounter a questionable morality.

1318
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,990
Why are you doing this?You know you don't have to.

1319
01:17:55,195 --> 01:17:58,745
I'm squirrel with a nut,
trying not to knock you,Kate.

1320
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:00,748
Holy shit!

1321
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:02,987
Another clone!Jonas!!

1322
01:18:03,197 --> 01:18:04,631
Have it!

1323
01:18:04,798 --> 01:18:07,154
Another clone!

1324
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,316
Oh!

1325
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,314
And Felix is down to the ten.Yeeeah!

1326
01:18:16,481 --> 01:18:18,871
Go,  We get Jonas.Repli-Jonas!

1327
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:23,636
With this hamster, I will demonstrate to you....

1328
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:26,517
The hyper-Replicator!

1329
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:46,166
And your world, Ladies and Gentlemen,
will never…

1330
01:18:53,052 --> 01:18:55,248
Your world will never
be the same....

1331
01:18:55,413 --> 01:18:57,085
Jonas!

1332
01:18:59,974 --> 01:19:03,490
Would you excuse me
for one moment?

1333
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,369
- Max.
- Ah!

1334
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,213
Oh! Psst.
Here!

1335
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:27,816
- Penis!

1336
01:19:31,223 --> 01:19:33,943
Penis, Penis. Penis.

1337
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:35,014
Penis.

1338
01:19:35,224 --> 01:19:37,898
Waht is going on?!

1339
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,464
We have a Kate,Sir.

1340
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:43,256
Well,find the other one!Fast!
I'm in the middle of my presentation!

1341
01:19:43,547 --> 01:19:47,336
Okay, I'll go right on her, Sir.
Anything else?

1342
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:49,499
Hey, here.Look.

1343
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:55,187
Cookies!

1344
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,225
Come here now.

1345
01:20:02,552 --> 01:20:04,384
Excuse me,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1346
01:20:06,464 --> 01:20:07,614
As I was saying…

1347
01:20:07,785 --> 01:20:11,176
Guys,a little problem:
Chumly is coming.

1348
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:13,416
Oh.That way, Quick.

1349
01:20:13,586 --> 01:20:14,815
Go.

1350
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:18,539
Go now.
- Yeah!

1351
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:21,177
- Cookies!
- Yeah, get down.

1352
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:25,907
What…
Couldn't wear a dress?

1353
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:27,788
Waht the hell is wrong with Jonas?

1354
01:20:27,951 --> 01:20:31,148
He's not really himself today, Sir.

1355
01:20:31,311 --> 01:20:32,745
Why he keeps saying "Penis"?

1356
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:34,783
No, he's saying, ah,"Genius".

1357
01:20:34,953 --> 01:20:37,865
No, it was "Penis".
Ah, we don't know.

1358
01:20:38,073 --> 01:20:41,544
And now, we take this blood here, and…

1359
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:46,107
… we combine it with some genetic, ah um,
hormone stuff,

1360
01:20:46,276 --> 01:20:49,075
put it right in
the Replicator…

1361
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:53,594
MALFUNCTION.

1362
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:07,642
And now, Ladies and Gentlemen…

1363
01:21:07,642 --> 01:21:09,599
ABNORMAL DNA PAIRS.
REPLICATION ERRORS!

1364
01:21:10,643 --> 01:21:13,716
… prepare yourself…

1365
01:21:13,884 --> 01:21:15,476
for the unbelievable,

1366
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:17,960
A fully grown,

1367
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:21,516
adult clone!

1368
01:21:25,767 --> 01:21:28,840
Is that bad?
Is that bad?

1369
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:37,411
There seems to be a small technical problem,

1370
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:40,211
Ladies and Gentlemen, but…

1371
01:21:40,372 --> 01:21:44,252
I can assure you that this
machine does indeed work.

1372
01:21:44,453 --> 01:21:47,013
Because my assistant Max even cloned…

1373
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:50,211
a human being…

1374
01:21:50,414 --> 01:21:53,931
in this machine.

1375
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:55,415
And there it is!

1376
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:58,330
Oh,no!

1377
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:03,171
And there is the original!

1378
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:06,530
One of them,I don't know which,
Vice Versa

1379
01:22:06,699 --> 01:22:08,577
Oh, come on.He's lying
We're twins!

1380
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:11,010
That's right. If max hadn't resqued us,

1381
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:13,416
Jonas would've turned us into the world's biggest frogs.

1382
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:17,416
Don't trust them,Ladies and Gentelmen
Because these clones are crafty.

1383
01:22:17,622 --> 01:22:20,012
Would you just give me a couple of minutes?
I could explain everything

1384
01:22:20,183 --> 01:22:21,936
I can prove they're lying..

1385
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,060
By getting blood samples from them

1386
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:28,060
We don't need to get blood samples.
It's not necessary!

1387
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:34,018
Get out of my way.

1388
01:22:34,187 --> 01:22:38,147
I can assure you that…

1389
01:22:38,268 --> 01:22:40,942
There is not a single human clone in this university.

1390
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:42,509
hello.

1391
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:44,581
Ah!

1392
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,707
He did it again!

1393
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:50,063
He cloned me this time!
- He cloned me this time.

1394
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:52,263
Max, I wanna know what's going on right here,
and I wanna know it now!

1395
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:55,033
Who made this clone?

1396
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:58,032
I did.

1397
01:22:58,194 --> 01:22:59,947
No, he didn't. I did.

1398
01:23:00,115 --> 01:23:01,787
No, she didn't. I did

1399
01:23:01,955 --> 01:23:04,424
No, they didn't, Sir.
Someone else did.

1400
01:23:04,636 --> 01:23:06,275
I'm here because of Dr. Fromer.

1401
01:23:06,437 --> 01:23:09,110
He made me what I'm today!

1402
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:13,027
Yeah, that's right!Jonas did it!
He's gone cloning crazy!

1403
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,190
Dr.Fromer has absolutely
nothing to do with any of this.

1404
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:17,231
Max  is just protecting him.

1405
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,675
I'm not.That's the truth
I can explain everything.

1406
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,351
- He cloned me.

1407
01:23:24,762 --> 01:23:27,402
It was him,
It's all him!

1408
01:23:27,563 --> 01:23:29,758
Would you shut the fuck up?

1409
01:23:31,604 --> 01:23:34,677
You, yes
I've been watching you.

1410
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:37,485
I know you're even more loyal to Dr. Fromer,
than Max is.

1411
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:39,364
I need the truth.

1412
01:23:39,526 --> 01:23:41,165
Go ahead, Felix.Tell them

1413
01:23:41,327 --> 01:23:44,684
He's been kissing my ass for years.
He knows what I'm capable of.

1414
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:48,766
Tell them!
- You know what?

1415
01:23:48,969 --> 01:23:50,846
Max is full of shit.

1416
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,399
These people are clones,
but, ah, Dr. Fromer told me…

1417
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,721
that he planned on making
a human clones....

1418
01:23:55,891 --> 01:23:58,531
with that Replicator.
He's a mad man!

1419
01:23:58,692 --> 01:24:00,603
No, no!

1420
01:24:02,893 --> 01:24:04,645
- guards.
- guards!

1421
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:08,444
Wait!Stay back!Stay back.

1422
01:24:09,895 --> 01:24:11,648
No, you idiotes!
They're lying!

1423
01:24:11,816 --> 01:24:14,728
And I can prove it.
Just let me get a blood sample.

1424
01:24:20,778 --> 01:24:22,576
Ouch !You dick!

1425
01:24:24,219 --> 01:24:25,335
You rock.

1426
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,253
I should've known a long time ago.

1427
01:24:29,301 --> 01:24:32,260
SPRlNGDALE PROFESSOR CAUGHT
IN HUMAN CLONING SHEME.

1428
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:40,222
Listen to me.Listen to me.
I have a banana

1429
01:24:40,384 --> 01:24:42,136
Hi, Felix.

1430
01:24:42,304 --> 01:24:44,057
How are you?
- Hey.fine, how are you?

1431
01:24:44,225 --> 01:24:45,978
- Fine.
- Good to see you.

1432
01:24:46,146 --> 01:24:47,738
You too.

1433
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:49,977
You want it, don't you?
Come on, get the banana.

1434
01:24:50,147 --> 01:24:54,061
Sure.We could use the
Replicator to clone…

1435
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:55,343
ah, Rhinos?

1436
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:58,307
But we have to build a much
bigger unit, obviuosly.

1437
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:02,228
Can I call you back, Mafuzi?
Yes, Sir.

1438
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,824
Hakuna Matata.

1439
01:25:04,031 --> 01:25:08,150
Hey.What you got there?

1440
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,463
We got the cover!

1441
01:25:10,633 --> 01:25:12,385
- Do you like it?
- Wow.

1442
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:16,706
- How cute you look ?
- Oh, Kate.

1443
01:25:16,874 --> 01:25:18,627
We gotta celebrate.
I should call Henry and Repli....

1444
01:25:18,795 --> 01:25:21,629
No, no, no.
I've rather celebrate it alone.

1445
01:25:21,796 --> 01:25:23,867
Oh, I can do that.

1446
01:25:30,278 --> 01:25:32,509
Refill.

1447
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:35,399
Yeah.sorry, I was finishing the dishes,

1448
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,712
Ah, listen, babe, ah,

1449
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:41,157
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining.

1450
01:25:41,322 --> 01:25:44,394
Because, this is just great.
- Hmm?

1451
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:48,477
Well, I was thinking, may be one time,

1452
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:52,479
You and I can go out for dinner,
and not watch sports.

1453
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:55,524
You know, somewhere we could
use a knife and a fork.

1454
01:25:55,686 --> 01:25:57,483
Wouldn't that be romantic?

1455
01:25:57,646 --> 01:25:59,399
You know what would be romantic?

1456
01:25:59,567 --> 01:26:01,798
What?

1457
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:14,367
ah.
Ten minutes of silence.

1458
01:26:14,531 --> 01:26:18,491
I just got words,Repli-Jonas has escaped
from the facility where they were studying him,

1459
01:26:18,612 --> 01:26:20,968
And noone knows where he is!
- Don't worry.

1460
01:26:21,053 --> 01:26:24,683
He's a fully grown idiot, with no skills.
How far could he possibly go.

1461
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,168
Penis!
