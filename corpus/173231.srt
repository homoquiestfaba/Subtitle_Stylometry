1
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,316
<i>Gathered friends,</i>

2
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,031
<i>listen again to our legend of the Bionicle.</i>

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,753
<i>In the time before time,</i>

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,708
<i>the Great Spirit descended from the heavens</i>

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,350
<i>carrying we, the ones called the Matoran,</i>

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,750
<i>to this paradise.</i>

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,196
<i>We were separate and without purpose</i>

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,435
<i>so the Great Spirit illuminated us</i>
<i>with the three virtues,</i>

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,194
<i>unity, duty</i>

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,715
<i>and destiny.</i>

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,833
<i>We embraced these gifts and, in gratitude,</i>
<i>we named our island home Mata Nui</i>

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,912
<i>after the Great Spirit himself.</i>

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,350
<i>But our happiness was not to last.</i>

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,680
<i>For Mata Nui's brother, the Makuta, was</i>
<i>jealous of these honours and betrayed him,</i>

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,756
<i>casting a spell over Mata Nui,</i>
<i>who fell into a deep slumber.</i>

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,037
<i>The Makuta was free</i>
<i>to unleash his shadows.</i>

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,390
<i>And unleash them, he did.</i>

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,309
Takua!

19
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,473
He's got more rocks in his head
than a Po-Matoran!

20
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,430
Takua!

21
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,675
Look, Pewku!

22
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,794
That's... why... they call

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,639
me... the Chronicler!

24
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,475
I bet no-one's recorded <i>this</i> before.

25
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,471
Takua!

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,150
What are you doing here?
We're supposed to be at the kohlii match!

27
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,714
Oh, yeah! Sorry, Jaller! Hang on a sec.
I just gotta check out that totem.

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,714
You're hopping across lava
to look at a stupid warning totem?

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,078
- What would Turaga Vakama say?
- "Irresponsible"?

30
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,789
- Now, come on!
- Be... right... there.

31
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,269
Very impressive!

32
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,877
Let's go!

33
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,071
Oh, no!

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,875
Takua, get outta there!

35
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,951
Uh-oh!

36
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,554
- Jaller! Look!
- A Great Kanohi mask!

37
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,913
- Wow! I've never seen this language.
- Takua!

38
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,389
Hold your Rahi! I'm coming!

39
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,432
Uh-oh! Here! Take the mask!

40
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,036
Jaller!

41
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,875
- Toa Tahu!
- Chronicler!

42
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,110
Sight-seeing, were ya?

43
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,309
Well, let's take a closer look at those falls!

44
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,598
Huh! So, Takua, this view close enough?

45
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,796
Incoming!

46
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,431
Aw, Takua!

47
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,876
Toa Tahu!

48
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,634
Takua? He didn't...?

49
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,154
You're alive! Kohlii-head!
You could have been lava bones!

50
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,110
Coulda been. But I'm not.

51
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,033
A Great Kanohi mask!

52
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,034
- It was in the lava. Takua...
- This could be important.

53
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,555
Take it to Turaga Vakama.

54
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,158
After you've won the kohlii match!
Then, no more sight-seeing!

55
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,395
Yes, Toa Tahu.

56
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,510
<i>We are thankful to the Great Spirit</i>
<i>for his gift of six guardians</i>

57
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,797
<i>who represent the elements.</i>

58
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,758
<i>Our mighty Toa!</i>

59
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,119
<i>We now enjoy peace and prosperity</i>

60
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,431
<i>and the opportunity to build,</i>

61
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,118
<i>as we have with our new kohlii field!</i>

62
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,116
Let us welcome our protectors.

63
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,829
The spirit of fire - Toa Tahu!

64
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,150
<i>From the village of water, Toa Gali!</i>

65
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,356
<i>And from the village of stone,</i>
<i>Toa Pohatu.</i>

66
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,638
- Pleasure to see you again, Gali.
- Thank you, Tahu!

67
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,633
Brother! I am thrilled to be here!

68
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,874
Well! Couldn't have our first match
without the patron of kohlii!

69
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,793
And so I am here!

70
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,997
Always a pleasure, Gali!

71
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,076
You two!

72
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,231
Still so ill at ease?

73
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,233
Put your petty differences aside!

74
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,516
Rejoice!

75
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,515
I think my brother is afraid
of having his fire eexinguished.

76
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,912
Sister! Against me
you'd be nothing but steam!

77
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,799
Hot air - as they say!

78
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,593
The Toa squabble
like gukko birds over a berry.

79
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,595
Their recent victories are a blessing,
but they've forgotten they need each other.

80
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,354
Indeed, Nokama.

81
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,155
We dedicate this kohlii field

82
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,074
to the Great Spirit, Mata Nui,

83
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,959
and to the three virtues -

84
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,190
<i>unity,</i>

85
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,158
<i>duty, destiny.</i>

86
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,835
Unity! Duty! Destiny!

87
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,235
Let the tournament... begin!

88
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,272
Ta-Koro welcomes three teams.

89
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,153
From the desert village of Po-Koro,

90
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,233
copper mask winners
and undisputed kohlii champions,

91
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,470
Hewkii and Hafu!

92
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,437
Kohlii! Kohlii!

93
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,312
From the shining seas of Ga-Koro,
the challengers, Hahli and Macku!

94
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,993
Go, Ga-Matorans!

95
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,438
And from Ta-Koro,
your own Captain of the Guard

96
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,875
and the Chronicler himself,

97
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,600
Jaller and Takua!

98
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,793
- Try your new move.
- Of course. It's what the audience came for.

99
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,354
Play well!

100
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,719
He's coming round the right.

101
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,636
- Nice save!
- Not bad!

102
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,430
Nothing gets by the Captain of the Guard.
Unless he wishes it!

103
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,876
I'll keep that in mind!

104
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,516
Wow! Great kick!

105
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,398
Goal!

106
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,512
Score!

107
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,670
What a shot!

108
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,349
I don't think
we've seen that move before!

109
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,151
Hahli scores!

110
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,950
Goal and tournament go to Ga-Koro!

111
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,112
Let's hear it, folks.

112
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,350
Once again!

113
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,231
Mata Nui!

114
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,280
Nice defence, Macku!

115
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,476
Good shooting, Hewkii.

116
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,918
- Good shooting yourself, Hahli.
- Not bad, for a Ga-Matoran!

117
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,716
Good effort, Takua.
Nice move there.

118
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,678
A little more practice and you'll be amazing.

119
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,319
Thanks.

120
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,040
Congratulations to Ga-Koro!

121
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,397
And well played by all.

122
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,990
- What's she doing?
- Sh! Translating.

123
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,509
This is the Great Kanohi mask of light.

124
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,029
A mask to be worn only by a Seventh Toa.

125
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,033
The prophecy is being fulfilled!

126
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,955
- Can this be true?
- A Toa of Light!

127
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,793
Legends foretell
the coming of a Seventh Toa

128
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,310
who will bring light to the shadows

129
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,596
and awaken Mata Nui.

130
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,712
What are we waiting for?
We should prepare for this Toa's arrival.

131
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,269
When will it be? And where?

132
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,673
This Toa will not simply appear
as you and the others did.

133
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,673
The Seventh Toa must be found.

134
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,435
- What?
- The Mask of Light chose who would find it.

135
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,673
Perhaps it also chose
who would deliver it to its master.

136
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,638
Wait. At the stadium.

137
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,032
There was a sign.
The mask threw its light upon one Matoran!

138
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,633
Jaller!

139
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,313
- He must be the herald of the Seventh Toa.
- But I didn't...

140
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,914
Tell them the truth. Say something.

141
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,991
I do say something.

142
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,632
I say... Hail Jaller!
All hail Jaller, herald of the Seventh Toa.

143
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,678
Hail, Jaller! Hail, Jaller!

144
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,754
You can not do this.
You have to be the herald.

145
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,559
Captain of the Guard, approach.

146
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,676
Takua!

147
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,717
Go on!

148
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,319
It seems the mask of light has chosen you.

149
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,788
Will you seek the Seventh Toa?

150
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,428
I... I will.

151
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,720
And Takua the Chronicler
has volunteered to join me.

152
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,671
Perfect.

153
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,038
While Jaller makes history, you will record it.

154
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,230
Soon, we will have another great chapter
to add to our wall.

155
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,110
Yes, Turaga.
It will be full of Jaller's brave deeds.

156
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,596
The Seventh Toa!

157
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,231
But why now? All the Makuta's threats
have been defeated.

158
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,555
Who can fathom the wisdom of Mata Nui?
I am happy to take good news to the north.

159
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,359
- You travel with Gali?
- No.

160
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,671
She has gone to ponder the great thoughts.

161
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,317
A seventh star!

162
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,111
The earth shudders, my brother.

163
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,715
The Seventh Toa has begun its approach.

164
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,877
Again the prophecies of the Matoran

165
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,396
oppose my will.

166
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,351
Must I release those
who should never see the light of day?

167
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,717
I must preserve your slumber.

168
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,793
Their unity can be poisoned.

169
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,599
Their duty will

170
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,718
be broken.

171
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,110
Their destiny,

172
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
I must shatter!

173
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,355
Go, my sons.

174
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,875
Use the shadows

175
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,873
and keep my brother

176
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,951
asleep!

177
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,552
Toa Pohatu has left for the north.

178
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,154
He spreads word of your search.

179
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,232
Oh, thanks. I'll take any help I can...

180
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,630
...give to Jaller

181
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,236
for his quest, the one that's his, that is.

182
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,876
Look, don't get mushy, Jaller.
I have no time for a long goodbye.

183
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,713
I... I was just gonna say...

184
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,759
well, you owe me a re-match
on the kohlii field.

185
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,913
Well, then.
You'd better hurry back because...

186
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,116
I'll be practising.

187
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,473
- You're bringing Pewku?
- I couldn't leave her behind if I wanted to.

188
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,712
- Stop!
- The shadows of the Makuta are powerful.

189
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,990
Do not take your journey lightly.

190
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,790
It will tolerate none of your foolery.

191
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,795
How will we know where to start?

192
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,713
Trust in the mask.

193
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,950
Let it be your guide.

194
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,638
Hard to argue with that.

195
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,950
Remember your duty

196
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,395
and walk in the light.

197
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,277
Move over!

198
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,718
Safely, in the light.

199
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,877
Mata Nui!

200
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,314
They're headed for Ta-Koro!

201
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,553
The Toa of Water approaches.
The Toa of Water...

202
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,154
Is here. Sound the alarm.

203
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,559
- Rahkshi!
- Shadows that cower in the depths.

204
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,950
Exactly as foretold!

205
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,597
None have breached
Ta-Koro's gates before.

206
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,274
And none shall this day.

207
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,388
Mata Nui protect us!

208
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,790
I'm coming, Tahu.

209
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,471
The Matoran.

210
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,672
Over here!

211
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,711
Take this!

212
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,153
Good job.

213
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,236
- We must get the Matoran to safety now.
- Surrender?

214
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,836
It's lost, Tahu. We need to regroup.

215
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,751
So be it.

216
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,593
- See the others to safety.
- Yes, Toa Gali.

217
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,991
Back! You foul creature!
One more step and I'll...

218
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,478
I'll take it from here, wise one.

219
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,873
Hurry. Go quickly.

220
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,797
Brother, be careful!

221
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,558
Rahkshi!

222
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,194
Tahu, your mask. I'm sorry.

223
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,316
It's nothing.

224
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,799
Poison!

225
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,552
This way!

226
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,150
Gali! Jump on!

227
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,432
Where shall we go from here?
The town's destroyed.

228
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,756
My home! They could have destroyed us.

229
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,957
- Why didn't they?
- They are seekers.

230
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,192
Whatever they came for, they didn't find.

231
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,833
- So what were they after?
- Makuta fears for his spell of shadows.

232
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,195
The mask of light?

233
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,148
Then they seek the Seventh Toa.
Jaller and Takua!

234
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,632
- We'll summon the Toa.
- Don't trouble the others, sister.

235
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,794
- I'll see to their safety myself.
- No, Tahu. No! We must remain united.

236
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,870
If you insist.

237
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,312
I hate the jungle.
It's all sticky and full of...

238
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,993
bugs!

239
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,594
How can you say that?

240
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,915
It's incredible! Is there any place
on Mata Nui where you do feel at home?

241
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,029
- I don't complain about Ta-Koro.
- But you wander off looking for stories.

242
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,034
- What about your story?
- I don't have a story.

243
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,829
'Cause you won't stand still
long enough to make one.

244
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,074
- We all have a destiny, you know.
- You know me, always different!

245
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,556
Keep him busy. I'm...

246
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,269
- Running away and leaving me!
- Just watch.

247
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,551
Toa Tahu does this...

248
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,279
Toa Lewa, Spirit of Air.

249
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,592
Mata Nui! Where did you learn to bear fight
like that, little one?

250
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,230
Right here. Just now.

251
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,473
Well, I'd say you're a natural,
brave fire-spitter!

252
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,632
Better finish what I started.

253
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,635
Now, now. What's that for?
You and ash bear got no wrong quarrel.

254
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,791
Just doin' her duty.

255
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,077
If it was your home realm,
you'd do the same.

256
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,955
Go now, sister bear.

257
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,989
Word is deepwood
that you seek the Seventh Toa.

258
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,390
He seeks. I follow.

259
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,717
He's the herald. I'm just his biographer.

260
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,270
If Toa Lewa helped on your search,

261
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,795
might he be a... spirit lift?

262
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,156
You...? With us?

263
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,232
We'd be honoured to have you walk with us.

264
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,633
Walk? Not never. If you ride with me,
there'll be no foot-walkin'.

265
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,711
Just air-flyin'.

266
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,276
Ever windfly a gukko bird?

267
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,397
I've been a second!

268
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,438
But... l've never flown one myself.

269
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,194
Then today's for quick-learnin'.

270
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,508
Stay sharp and follow well.

271
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,553
Sorry, Pewku, no room.

272
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,711
Go on home.

273
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,673
- What?
- We're here.

274
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,755
Hey, not bad!
You even kept us on the right path.

275
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,993
The drums of the Koro
bring a sorrybad story.

276
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,158
Your village has fallen to...

277
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,471
Rahkshi? The Makuta's sons.

278
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,111
My village? In trouble.

279
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,352
I should have been there.

280
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,195
- I must return!
- Sorry, firespitter. Past late to help now.

281
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,352
The mask most needs you.

282
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,390
- Takua will continue in my place.
- No way. You accepted this duty.

283
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,269
- Your duty!
- Stop! What is this duty quarrel?

284
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,433
We all have a duty to Mata Nui.
No time to in-fight.

285
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,114
I must go, be with the Toa.

286
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,152
But then I'll go to your village, Jaller.
Heart promise.

287
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,477
I...

288
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,915
I can't thank you enough, Toa.

289
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,709
Does something here look familiar?

290
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,278
Well, maybe our path would be straighter
if the real herald had the mask.

291
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,795
The real herald has the mask.

292
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,715
- Couldn't find water if I fell out of a canoe.
- What do you think I can find?

293
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,150
Bohrok!

294
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,432
Frozen? What could do this to them?

295
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,511
Kopaka!

296
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,389
Toa of Ice. How did you find us?

297
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,076
- It was you who were following me.
- We were?

298
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,029
We didn't mean to. We were lost.

299
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,113
- We're on a mission. You've heard of it?
- No.

300
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,158
We've been sent to find the Seventh Toa.

301
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,073
Takua was in the tunnel with the lava break,

302
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,073
where he's not supposed to be, by the way.

303
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,074
Ta-Koro's gone, Lewa.

304
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,313
Buried by the very lava that sustained it.

305
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,914
Tahu...

306
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,434
You worry about scratches?

307
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,510
My village is gone!

308
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,120
Your power was nothing.

309
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,475
My power

310
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,756
was nothing.

311
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,309
We are same-hearted, brother.

312
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,268
That heart will quicken us
to stop the evil spread.

313
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,908
First, we must be united.

314
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,230
Together, we are strong.

315
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,513
Ko-Koro!

316
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,157
No!

317
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,593
Stop!

318
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,910
- Go!
- The Captain of the Guard never runs a...

319
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,389
way...

320
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,219
Dead end!

321
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:37,649
Jaller...

322
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,971
Jaller!

323
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:42,097
What?

324
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,571
The mask!

325
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:08,135
Rahkshi - washed and chilled!

326
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:36,940
- It moves!
- Even I get lucky sometimes.

327
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,736
Not luck.

328
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,938
It's what you do that makes a hero.

329
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,569
- No! Stop, Pewku!
- Pewku!

330
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:56,095
Wow! She must have come
right through the jungle.

331
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:03,137
Not bad! Maybe Pewku
should be the herald, Toa Kopaka?

332
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:09,419
- He just left us here.
- He must see to his village.

333
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:30,251
"Onu-Koro highway." Hasn't been used
in a while. We don't have a light stone.

334
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:36,299
Who needs light stones?

335
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,539
Tunnels!

336
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:04,091
Hey!

337
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:08,772
Hey, Jaller!

338
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:10,738
Jaller?

339
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:13,813
<i>Takua.</i>

340
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:17,973
Guys? Where d'you go?

341
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:20,894
<i>Takua!</i>

342
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:23,780
Jaller? Jaller!

343
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:30,379
Shadows are everywhere!

344
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,055
And where they are,

345
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:35,689
so am I.

346
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:39,171
I know who you are. I'm... I'm not afraid.

347
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:43,897
Even my shadows cannot hide your fear.

348
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:46,575
- Or the truth.
- What truth?

349
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,699
That you will not find the Seventh Toa.

350
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,774
And, deep down, you know it.

351
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:56,614
So I won't. Maybe Jaller will.

352
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,011
And if he doesn't,

353
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:01,979
he will die because of you.

354
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,772
Bring me the mask, Takua.

355
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:07,932
Bring it to me

356
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:11,013
and you won't lose your friend.

357
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,741
No. I won't let everyone down.

358
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:16,819
You fail them more if you refuse.

359
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,415
For the mask,

360
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:22,653
your villages and Jaller

361
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:26,018
will be spared.

362
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,820
Don't be a fool.

363
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:31,370
No! I can't!

364
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,736
Takua!

365
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:37,695
The mask is pointing this way.

366
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:45,090
Where did you wander off to?

367
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:47,980
Jaller... about the mask.

368
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:50,097
What about it?

369
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:52,650
Are you ready to take it finally?

370
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:55,574
I can't. I can't go with you.

371
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,219
What?

372
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,293
Why?

373
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:06,170
- I can't explain.
- That's just great!

374
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:09,378
You stick me with your duty then ditch me?

375
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,294
My duty's to myself. I quit!

376
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,975
Just... take the mask and go!

377
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,056
Fine! But I won't give up.

378
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:23,976
I'll find the Seventh Toa
whether you're the true herald or not.

379
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:41,175
My goodwill refused!

380
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:47,573
My noble sons

381
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:50,209
bound in ice.

382
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:55,533
So my hand is cast!

383
00:40:55,701 --> 00:41:02,254
Now I must pierce
that which the Toa hold dear.

384
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,015
<i>Anger amongst them</i>

385
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:09,857
<i>will threaten their precious unity!</i>

386
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:13,251
<i>Hunger</i>

387
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,811
<i>will consume their duty.</i>

388
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:21,701
<i>And fear</i>

389
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:27,174
<i>will keep them from their destiny.</i>

390
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:31,857
They will not disturb you.

391
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:45,250
Onua, my friend.

392
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:48,254
It seems bashing granite is treating you well.

393
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:50,981
Pohatu!

394
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,929
Look around you!
Mining has never been better!

395
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:59,378
You should join me at it some time.

396
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:04,535
Try doing a real job!
Say, how goes the carving?

397
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,340
Their work is magnificent

398
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:11,289
but nowhere near as good
as the other tidings I bring.

399
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,379
Come forward!

400
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:18,260
Matoran of Onu-Koro!

401
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:22,050
The mask of light has been found.

402
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:29,220
Jaller, the Captain of the Guard
of Ta-Koro, and Takua the Chronicler,

403
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:32,418
even now seek the Seventh Toa!

404
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:38,535
Chronicler, where is the herald?

405
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,897
We got...

406
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:45,454
...separated after we met the Rahkshi.

407
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:48,089
The... Rahkshi?

408
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:50,377
What is Rahkshi?

409
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:07,939
Those.

410
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:10,092
Except, different ones.

411
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,775
Just those are plenty for now.

412
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:15,819
Welcome to Onu-Koro!

413
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:28,180
Run! Run! Get outta the way.

414
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:31,094
Come on, Pewku. Let's get outta here!

415
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:32,819
Run!

416
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:54,336
My...

417
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,731
My strength!

418
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:01,972
My power.

419
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:06,698
Onua!

420
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:22,452
What have I done?

421
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:31,129
Pewku!

422
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,337
Pewku!

423
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:50,813
Rahkshi!

424
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,451
No, Tahu!

425
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:05,251
- Back!
- Windfly!

426
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:12,133
Brother!

427
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,531
Fire has no brothers.

428
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,775
Fire consumes all!

429
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:33,335
Quick-speed to Jaller. Warn him.

430
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,731
I will.

431
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:43,099
Pewku! Where are you going?
Come on, girl.

432
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:46,011
Attagirl, Pewku.

433
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:49,139
All right. Up! OK.

434
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:52,172
Keep going.

435
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,177
Keep going.

436
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:57,292
Come on.

437
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:27,570
- Your turn!
- It will be a pleasure!

438
00:46:44,781 --> 00:46:49,013
Well done!
But how did you keep the ceiling...

439
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,775
from collapsing on us too?

440
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:58,859
Whoa!

441
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:05,653
Tahu, remember who you are.
Remember your destiny!

442
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:09,496
I have no destiny!

443
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:14,056
Sorry, brother.

444
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:16,974
Brothers, let's take him to safety.

445
00:47:44,701 --> 00:47:47,374
We gotta find Jaller. Come on!

446
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:54,618
Come on, Pewku. Let's get outta here.

447
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:07,334
The poison is destroying him. We must
counteract it. His life depends on it.

448
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:11,574
- Do you know the cure?
- Perhaps, but we must act.

449
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:16,974
Let us summon all the healing powers
we possess. Lewa, ready his sword.

450
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:21,579
Kopaka.

451
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:32,299
That's enough.

452
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:38,375
Brother!

453
00:49:02,661 --> 00:49:04,572
You did all you could.

454
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:11,934
Kopaka.
Were the Turaga right about us?

455
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:15,491
Have we lost our unity?

456
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,257
Kopaka?

457
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:20,892
Kopaka?

458
00:49:38,661 --> 00:49:41,016
Mata Nui!

459
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,854
Where does my destiny lie?

460
00:49:54,421 --> 00:49:57,811
Well, I guess I asked!

461
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,452
What now?

462
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:08,856
Grab on!

463
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:14,933
Well, well, well!
Whatever happened to "I quit"?

464
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:18,298
I could've. But I... didn't.

465
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:22,534
Bad news. More Rahkshi.
They've taken Onu-Koro.

466
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:28,173
- The mask of light wasn't at Onu-Koro.
- They're looking for the herald.

467
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:32,732
- You sure they were after the herald?
- Oh, yeah. Real sure.

468
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:35,654
Then we'd better find the Seventh Toa.

469
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:45,340
Sister, he is open-eyed.

470
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:53,455
- Brother, are you well?
- No. No, I'm not well.

471
00:50:55,421 --> 00:50:58,299
But I... I am alive

472
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:01,021
and in your debt, my sister.

473
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:08,098
Kini Nui, the great temple.

474
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:12,652
No way! We've been all over the island
to wind up here?

475
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,255
Why not? It's a special place.

476
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:18,299
Are you sure this thing is working right?

477
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:25,773
Wow!

478
00:51:26,261 --> 00:51:28,934
- Oops.
- What did you do?

479
00:51:34,421 --> 00:51:37,493
This is it. The Seventh Toa must be here.

480
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,452
- Rahkshi!
- Give me the mask!

481
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:46,216
No. The mask chose me.
I'm the true herald.

482
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:48,531
Are you sure? Even now?

483
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:50,851
Yes, I am the herald.

484
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:53,330
And I say run!

485
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,140
Now what?

486
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:04,291
We're trapped,

487
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:06,850
but not helpless.

488
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,538
Toa! Great! You can get us outta here.

489
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:24,010
We are done running.

490
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:26,092
- Wha...?
- What's that?

491
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,490
Brothers, we thought we lost you.

492
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:37,574
And you might have
if it weren't for our icy friend.

493
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,977
Now, as one!

494
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:48,371
We will not be broken.

495
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:54,496
Windfly. Sand twister!

496
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,979
Gira!

497
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:09,733
Sand!

498
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:11,892
And fire!

499
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,810
Makes glass!

500
00:53:22,861 --> 00:53:24,772
Back off!

501
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:28,777
Surprise.

502
00:53:28,941 --> 00:53:30,659
Rahkshi!

503
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:37,179
Leave the heavy lifting to me!

504
00:53:38,661 --> 00:53:40,617
Lava!

505
00:53:45,741 --> 00:53:47,413
Water!

506
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,333
And ice.

507
00:54:06,941 --> 00:54:09,250
<i>Takua!</i>

508
00:54:10,101 --> 00:54:12,854
<i>Feel me.</i>

509
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:16,618
<i>Fear me!</i>

510
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,694
No!

511
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:29,449
I'm supposed to make the sacrifice.

512
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:31,896
No. The duty was mine.

513
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:36,499
You know who you are.

514
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:40,940
You were always different.

515
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:59,053
<i>You know who you are.</i>

516
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:32,257
I am Takanuva, Toa of Light.

517
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:04,970
<i>So, it has begun, my brother,</i>

518
00:56:05,141 --> 00:56:09,339
<i>but soon it will also</i>

519
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,571
end.

520
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:24,698
All this, just to discover who I am?

521
00:56:26,781 --> 00:56:30,740
You have finally found your own story,

522
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:33,654
and still you seek answers.

523
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:38,132
Mata Nui is wiser than all.

524
00:56:38,301 --> 00:56:43,295
The path you walked
was not to be here but in here!

525
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:49,454
You understand. Your destiny is clear.

526
00:56:51,381 --> 00:56:53,417
My duty is clear.

527
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:57,779
Jaller's sacrifice will not be in vain.

528
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:08,541
How will this way find the Makuta?

529
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:11,659
What is the Makuta's shall return to him.

530
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:24,736
Jaller was your herald.
Let him continue to lead you to victory.

531
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:29,771
- Well said, Hahli.
- Not much room in this transport.

532
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:33,900
- Where will we all sit, brother?
- You shall not join me.

533
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:37,371
But, united,
our power defeated the Rahkshi.

534
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:41,011
It will take nothing less
to defeat the Makuta.

535
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:43,456
I have but one destiny.

536
00:57:43,621 --> 00:57:46,897
Yours lie with the Matoran
and the Turaga.

537
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:49,814
Gather them and wait for my return.

538
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:36,980
- Hahli!
- It's time someone was your chronicler.

539
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:11,779
You can no longer hide in shadow.

540
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:17,019
<i>I am shadow,</i>

541
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:20,059
<i>the shadow that guards the gate.</i>

542
00:59:20,981 --> 00:59:23,051
<i>Now, run along</i>

543
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:26,213
or accept your doom.

544
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:32,735
I am done running.
Mata Nui will be awakened this day.

545
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:36,411
- Hahli! Summon the Matoran.
- It's done.

546
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:41,372
Toa of Light.

547
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:44,101
Now so bold.

548
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:48,693
<i>But at heart you are still</i>

549
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,852
<i>just Takua.</i>

550
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:53,899
You failed to save your friend.

551
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:57,778
You didn't even warn him.

552
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:03,857
Perhaps, for your neex great failure,
a simple game of kohlii?

553
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:09,139
Win and you may try to open the gate.

554
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:12,177
When you lose,

555
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:15,014
I'll have that mask.

556
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:17,775
I will not lose.

557
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:24,338
Come on!

558
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:36,297
I bring word from Takanuva.
He wants us to follow.

559
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:39,339
We are to awaken Mata Nui today.

560
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:43,016
Is it the right thing to do?

561
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,979
A light among the shadows.

562
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:49,292
The prophecy is fulfilled. We must go.

563
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:54,298
If we descend into those tunnels
we may never return.

564
01:00:59,861 --> 01:01:02,295
Still running, Toa?

565
01:01:07,661 --> 01:01:09,492
Friends!

566
01:01:09,661 --> 01:01:13,893
- Silence.
- This island is a great, wondrous place.

567
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:19,010
Never have any been as blessed
as we are to live in such a paradise.

568
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:20,773
True.

569
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:24,058
I love my home and Jaller loved it too.

570
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:26,860
Above all, Jaller respected his duty.

571
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:32,698
Let us repay him by doing our duty,
remember him by fulfilling our destiny.

572
01:01:32,861 --> 01:01:35,295
Let us go forward together.

573
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:39,333
Let us awaken the Great Spirit.

574
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:44,929
My brother...

575
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:49,376
...shall not...

576
01:01:50,221 --> 01:01:52,735
...be awakened.

577
01:01:52,901 --> 01:01:54,698
Come on!

578
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:11,459
An audience gathers
for your final failure, Toa of Light.

579
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:14,818
Maybe they will not see me win today,

580
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,370
but the Matoran will go on

581
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,896
and, some day, they will triumph.

582
01:02:20,061 --> 01:02:24,691
You actually believe
I would let them return?

583
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:37,333
They will not leave.

584
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,094
Well played, Toa.

585
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:24,654
Now I will protect Mata Nui from you.

586
01:03:24,821 --> 01:03:28,780
- Protect him?
- Sleep spares him pain.

587
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:31,694
Awake, he suffers.

588
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:38,377
- You are not protecting him.
- My duty is to the mask of shadows.

589
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:42,375
Then let's take a closer look
behind that mask.

590
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:48,812
No!

591
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:38,451
Mata Nui!

592
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,379
Light and shadow

593
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:02,771
have become one.

594
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,052
Light has revealed the will of Mata Nui.

595
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:11,372
Our brother must be awakened.

596
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:33,013
Go! Run!

597
01:05:34,701 --> 01:05:37,135
Hold, little one.

598
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:40,134
That mask needs life.

599
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,053
Jaller.

600
01:06:21,421 --> 01:06:25,130
My duty is done.

601
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:34,096
Get outta there!

602
01:06:53,341 --> 01:06:57,129
Let us awaken the Great Spirit.

603
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,252
Unity.

604
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,497
Duty.

605
01:07:13,621 --> 01:07:15,418
Destiny!

606
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:37,892
You're alive!

607
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:42,335
Kohlii-head!
You could've been Makuta bones!

608
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:45,174
Could've been. But I'm not.

609
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:56,490
<i>United, we embraced our duty.</i>

610
01:07:57,421 --> 01:08:02,541
<i>Light found itself</i>
<i>and illuminated our destiny.</i>

611
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:07,458
<i>The city of the Great Spirit,</i>

612
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:11,409
<i>my island home, re</i>- <i>found.</i>

613
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:17,335
<i>New legends awake,</i>

614
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:21,494
<i>but old lessons must be remembered.</i>

615
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:25,251
<i>This is the way</i>

616
01:08:25,421 --> 01:08:27,457
<i>of the Bionicle.</i>
