1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,635
Action!

2
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,989
OK, folks, here they come.
Lots of applause.

3
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,109
The marvellous Harry Secombe,
the delightful Spike Milligan...

4
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,073
Oh, and Peter Sellers.

5
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,395
This is the BBC Home Service.

6
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,639
It's time for...

7
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,433
Another remarkable 1957 edition

8
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,156
of the wireless, talking type... Goon Show!

9
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,030
You sir, with the linen hair and oily suit.

10
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,958
What is it that you want,
you sick and twisted boy?

11
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,150
I must ask you to empty your pockets.

12
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,914
Ah, quit stalling, man. Empty your pockets.

13
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,791
Now listen to me, Neddie,
that is our entire worldly wealth.

14
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,040
What, what, what, what, what? Then what's
that ominous bulge in the seat of his trousers?

15
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,390
Oh, just some leather meringues.

16
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,593
Listen to me, my good man, we'd like
to hire your stained-glass battering ram.

17
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,995
- Ooh, what for?
- How about two shillings?

18
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,237
- I haven't got two shillings.
- We'll take it anyway.

19
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,479
No! You dirty, rotten swine!

20
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,637
<i>You broke my little cardboard sword</i>.

21
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,398
<i>A stowaway, I sayl Come on outl</i>

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,636
<i>All right, I will come out</i>.

23
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,713
Send in Mr Sellers.

24
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,519
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Sellers.

25
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,069
- Now...
- Yul Brynner. Is that you with him?

26
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,513
Yes. Am I right in reading that
you're here for the part of Ned Brockway?

27
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,119
Yes, that's right.

28
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,915
You do realise the script calls
for a 60-year-old war veteran?

29
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,112
I've got his voice worked out.
I could do a bit for you.

30
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,629
Mr Sellers, I know you're quite big on radio...

31
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,432
I don't like to boast.

32
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,949
But film's a different medium.

33
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,435
It's one I'm quite, quite keen on.

34
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,949
- A visual medium, dear.
- Yes, of course.

35
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,355
A very unforgivingly visual medium.

36
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,469
But thank you ever so much for coming.

37
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,555
I am little Michael Bluebottle.
I am an ace private detective.

38
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,037
He's got his own scooter,
he's got his own make-up.

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,555
- He goes anywhere in fiction.
- And I am hotfoot after the criminals

40
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,511
what have stolen all the string!

41
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,710
I suspect the Moriarty man.

42
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,752
Ah, where is that Moriarty man?

43
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,873
- Thinks. Points finger.
- Pointy, pointy, pointy.

44
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,679
Oh, God, now we've done it.

45
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,075
- I'll get her, Anne.
- It's all right, I'll go.

46
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,953
No, it's my house, I'll help Peter.

47
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,640
You're tired. You stay and rest.
Have some fun.

48
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,149
Leave it to me and Peg.

49
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,558
All right, Dad, you can be
Major Dennis Bloodnok.

50
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,276
And you've just apprehended
England's biggest string criminal.

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,311
- All right.
- Peter?

52
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,158
You're under arrest.

53
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,395
It's all right, it's all right.

54
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,478
Dear, dear me.

55
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,511
That's the girl.

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,710
She's lovely. There we are.

57
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,354
Thanks, Mum. I'll... I'll do it.

58
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,350
Those film people won't have
anything to do with me, Mum.

59
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,710
It was my fifth audition this week.

60
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,909
- What did they say to you?
- Same as usual.

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,952
Not good-looking enough,
not magnetic enough.

62
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,074
"Stick to radio. That's what you're good at."
Keep being the ringmaster in a circus of twits.

63
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,190
Maybe I should just be content.

64
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,197
You simpering cow.

65
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,313
How can you be content changing nappies
in a flat like a woman?

66
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,750
You want to be a failure like your father,
mewl about contentment.

67
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,952
- That's not very fair.
- I didn't bring you up to be content.

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,232
I didn't slog round third-rate music halls
doing three shows a night

69
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,237
so you could powder your baby's bottom

70
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,397
and whine about how nobody
ever gives the radio man a chance.

71
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,388
Peter, no one's gonna hand it to you.

72
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,512
You want success,
you've gotta go out and take it!

73
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,395
Bite the hand that feeds you. There'll
always be another hand with more food.

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,353
And they'll be impressed
by the sharpness of your teeth!

75
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,391
Come here.

76
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,149
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

77
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,316
- I love you, Peter.
- I love you, Peg.

78
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,477
- I really love you, Peter.
- I love you, too, Peg.

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,230
- I really love you, Peter.
- No, I really love you, Peg.

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,831
Send in Mr Cobblers.

81
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,639
Good morning.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,310
- Good morning.
- Oh, it is.

83
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,114
Would you like to sit down, Mr Cobblers?

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,435
I'd prefer to stand, if you don't mind.

85
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,116
You see, I caught
a bit of shrapnel... in the Ardennes.

86
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,597
I quite understand.
Now, I don't appear to have received your CV.

87
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,359
That would be
because I don't have one, madam.

88
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,076
I don't believe a man's worth
can be summed up on a piece of paper.

89
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,679
It wouldn't be fair to me. Or to you.

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,190
Or to any of those dear lads I left behind...

91
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,110
in no-man's-land.

92
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,358
But you have acted?

93
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,031
All over this fair land, madam.

94
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,952
Well, we'll have to have
a formal audition, of course.

95
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,674
But I must say, you're nearly perfect.

96
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,791
Well, we...

97
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,912
Well...

98
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,237
Yes, well... That's what I was thinking.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,197
It's me. Peter.

100
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,356
You naughty boy.

101
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,358
Perhaps now we could talk
about my contract.

102
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,792
<i>Our nominees for best performance</i>
<i>by a British actor are</i> - 

103
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,357
<i>Richard Burton, Peter Finch,</i>
<i>Laurence Olivier</i>

104
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,712
<i>and Peter Sellers</i>.

105
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,479
<i>And the British Academy Award goes to</i>...

106
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,070
<i>Peter Sellers, for I'm All Right Jack</i>.

107
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,713
<i>Your Royal Highness, you naughty man</i>.

108
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,797
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much</i>
<i>indeed for this award, which I shall treasure</i>.

109
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,879
<i>You know, I went to consult</i>
<i>an acknowledged expert about tonight,</i>

110
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,913
<i>someone who has published</i>
<i>several pamphlets on this subject</i> - 

111
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,951
<i>my mother</i>.

112
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,039
She told me to be short, to be sweet
and be circumscribed.

113
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,276
Which I am.

114
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,030
Don't we have any macaroons?

115
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,956
Oh, yes.

116
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,719
It would be nice to think
me son were happy then.

117
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,356
He might have been, at that, if he could
have been happy with "good enough".

118
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,912
Come here. But "good enough"
were never what his mother had in mind.

119
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,878
That boy needed a firmer hand.

120
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,997
I don't know.

121
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,114
Maybe if Peg had let us all settle down
in one place for long enough...

122
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,469
If Pete had had a regular routine, like,

123
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,991
I might have been able to teach him
something about life the way I saw it.

124
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,671
- The straightforwardness of it.
- Peter Sellers, I'm All Right Jack.

125
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,675
We had to keep t'show on road.

126
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,274
<i>I remember once, we were all</i>
<i>in a café in Brighton, having our tea</i>.

127
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,914
<i>Pete would have been five, probably six</i>.

128
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,154
We got down to the last cake on the plate

129
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,714
and before I could ask who wanted to share it,

130
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,912
Pete snatched it up, licked it all over.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,070
I took it off him, of course.

132
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,670
He threw himself on t'floor,
screaming his bloody head off.

133
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,758
<i>Peg just laughed. She bought him sweets</i>.

134
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,316
Those bloody rages.

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,309
Pete always got the last cake.

136
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,712
- Even if it were on someone else's plate.
- Background action.

137
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,633
...her sense of fashion and style.

138
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,516
- There we are.
- Here it comes.

139
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,836
Mr Sellers. What does it feel like
to be co-starring with Sophia Loren?

140
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,512
Soft, warm, a little like
being a young boy in a bakery

141
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,915
very early in the morning.

142
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,076
There she is.

143
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,436
- Sophia!
- Miss Loren!

144
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,551
- This way, Miss Loren.
- Miss Loren.

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,800
Excuse me, which one
of you gentlemen is Peter Sellers?

146
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,833
Peter!

147
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,396
Welcome to England, Miss Loren.

148
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,749
"We have never had it so good."

149
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,315
- If you go back so we can get...
- That's it.

150
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,714
- Lovely.
- Over here!

151
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,638
Please, Miss Loren, to be telling me
about your dreams.

152
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,992
Oh, Doctor, they started when I was a girl.

153
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,634
A girl. Goodness, gracious me.

154
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,077
This is a very good start.
What were you dreaming about, as a girl?

155
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,999
Boys.

156
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,076
So you have been crazy for the boys?

157
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,636
No. They were crazy for me.

158
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,194
That is not so crazy.

159
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,595
Such a funny boy.

160
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,988
- Excuse me. Miss Loren, it's your husband.
- Ah, thank you.

161
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,995
I can't see.

162
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,870
Open your eyes. Surprise!

163
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,355
Daddy, what's in there?

164
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,352
And here we have this year's Formula One
grand champion, Michael Sellers,

165
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,630
dubbed "the human lightning bolt".

166
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,595
Like any professional, young Sellers
gives his equipment a once-over.

167
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,238
This attention to detail allowed this speedster
to leave Stirling Moss in the dust at Aintree.

168
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,753
Eyes clear, the ambitious Sellers
presents a portrait of determination.

169
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,431
What's that, sir?

170
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,630
What the bloody hell is that?

171
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,273
I'm going to phone the dealer.
Hard-shell paint job. Bollocks!

172
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,436
I'll murder him!

173
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,875
Come and see, Dad!

174
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,150
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.

175
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,150
Dad! Come and see. Please.

176
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,231
I fixed it. I made it look beautiful.
It looks just like a racing car now.

177
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,639
Dad? Don't you like it, Dad?

178
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,511
Dad?

179
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,156
You see, Michael? I fixed all your toys for you.

180
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,796
Aren't they beautiful?

181
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,312
Come on, darling,
we're going downstairs. Come on.

182
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,317
It's all right.

183
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,751
Your go.

184
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,911
Two.

185
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,197
Michael. You know
what happened this morning?

186
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,072
Yeah.

187
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,954
- You know Daddy didn't mean it, don't you?
- Yeah.

188
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,275
You know it's not your fault?

189
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,110
He's working very hard.

190
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,798
- He gets carried away sometimes.
- OK.

191
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,349
Michael. Can I see you for a second?

192
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,236
We're in here.

193
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,238
Hi, Mike. I've got a surprise for you.

194
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,071
Say, pardner, come and say howdy
to your new friend.

195
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,390
- Give him some apple.
- OK.

196
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,632
- Hello. Amazing.
- D'you like him?

197
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,399
- I love him.
- Come round the front.

198
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,479
- Look, Mum.
- I think he likes you.

199
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,239
Big smile for Daddy.

200
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,999
- Let's call him Fred.
- Fred.

201
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,551
He's asleep.

202
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,878
Tell me honestly, darling.
Is it hard to believe

203
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,753
that a woman like this
could fall for a man like me?

204
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,799
Maybe it is something to do
with the mystery of being in love.

205
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,358
I'm afraid, men,

206
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,632
we're going to have to take
all these little cars to the toy hospital.

207
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,796
It's just not charming any more.

208
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,231
That's good. I have to be more than
charming, I've got to be passionate.

209
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,432
I'm starring opposite the most
beautiful woman in the world.

210
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,755
Your son was terrified today.

211
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,032
I'm under a lot of pressure.
I could use your support.

212
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,833
You've always had my support, Peter.

213
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,152
It's my patience that I'm no longer sure about.

214
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,671
Peter.

215
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,758
- Peter, what are you doing?
- I've been bad.

216
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,117
- Oh, Peter, come out of there.
- No.

217
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,510
Oh, hello.

218
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,790
Do you want to come down here
and join the little people?

219
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,952
- Peter.
- Yes, my love?

220
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,950
Why can't we be a normal family?

221
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,870
We are.

222
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,079
You can't catch me!

223
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,998
- Sarah, I'm here.
- Waving to Daddy.

224
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,189
- That's nice.
- Get here, Michael.

225
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,109
- Champagne, Miss Loren?
- Please.

226
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,953
Thank you.

227
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,359
Are you tired?
I could give you a lift home after this.

228
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,393
My home is in Rome.
That's an awfully long drive, no?

229
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
Well, we do have all night.

230
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,231
You are sweet.
But the studio gives me a limo.

231
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,432
Besides, you live so far out here in the country.

232
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,950
It's out of your way to drive me into town.

233
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,874
Great thing about town,
you're so close to everything.

234
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,312
Buckingham Palace is across the way,
if you need to borrow some sugar.

235
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,830
It's not the moving I mind, Peter.

236
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,351
It's just not knowing I'm moving.

237
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,920
Darling, I'd like you to meet Ted Levy.

238
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,237
I've brought him on as our interior decorator.

239
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,229
By Royal appointment. HRH, you know.
To lighten your load, an' all. Ted. Anne.

240
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,314
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Sellers.

241
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,230
He's a handsome devil.

242
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,275
But I figure a handsome man
will be able to make us a handsome flat.

243
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,594
- Yes.
- I wouldn't go as far as that.

244
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,593
Now, Anne, Ted has got some
brilliant ideas for this place.

245
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,639
- Mr Levy, was it?
- Ted.

246
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,071
Call time.

247
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,236
I've gotta go.

248
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,679
I've got to... I must dash orf.

249
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,550
You two, choose away!

250
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,556
Oh, have a drinkie-poo and make a night of it.

251
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,069
Ted, whatever's fine with Anne
is perfectly fine with me.

252
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,194
Why don't I show you what I've got in mind?

253
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,629
Darling, you made it.

254
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,671
Oh, Peter!

255
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,554
- Isn't your wife joining us?
- André.

256
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
What would sir and madam say to a little fish?

257
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,194
I'd probably say, "Hello, little fish".

258
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,796
Thank you.

259
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,514
- To us, my darling.
- You are wonderful.

260
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,391
I just can't believe my luck.

261
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,276
You are lucky? How?

262
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,800
We are going to be very happy together.

263
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,116
It's so dark in here, hm?

264
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,994
Oh, yes, well...
We have to take precautions, you know.

265
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,680
What do you mean, precautions?

266
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,112
Should we tell the world?
Stop all this sneaking about?

267
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,235
But, Peter, I thought
we were having a friendly dinner.

268
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,553
It'll be relief to you, too.
Ponti's such a nice man.

269
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,591
It must be hard, lying to your husband.

270
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,919
I think you are mistaken.

271
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,114
Go home to your children
and go home to your wife, Peter.

272
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,436
She's right.

273
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,830
They should be the first to know.

274
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,591
Well, what d'you think?

275
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,191
Does this mean you want a divorce?

276
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,353
You know, I hadn't thought about it.

277
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,471
Not necessarily.

278
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,318
Do you still love us?

279
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,755
Of course I do, sweetheart.

280
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,996
Just...

281
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,509
not as much as I love Sophia Loren.

282
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,191
What's he talking about?

283
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,470
I don't know, darling. Come here.

284
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,236
Hello, Ted. It's Anne Sellers.

285
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,673
I'm glad you're there.
I've had an idea about the colour.

286
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,149
Well, I was wondering if we could meet.

287
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,714
Yes. Yes, that would be lovely.

288
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,956
I'll see you there.

289
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,510
George, how are you?

290
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,951
Hello.

291
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,193
Are you enjoying being Sophia's stand-in?

292
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,632
Yes.

293
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,274
Have you ever ridden
in the back of a Rolls-Royce?

294
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,918
- Why, no.
- Next best thing to a Bentley.

295
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,831
Anne?

296
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,875
Michael.

297
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,835
You awake?

298
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,676
Hi, Dad.

299
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,316
What is it?

300
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,229
Your mother is sleeping
with the interior decorator.

301
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,952
- Where are the children?
- They're at Peg's.

302
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,149
If you leave this flat,
I'm going to jump off this balcony.

303
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,350
Don't make me any promises, Peter.

304
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,789
All right, I'll meet you downstairs.

305
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,156
I had you followed.

306
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,238
The detectives asked
if I wanted to see pictures. I said no.

307
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,114
- I thought that was rather chivalrous.
- How considerate.

308
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,755
You're not to leave this house again.
I forbid it. Come back here!

309
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,151
Anne!

310
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,478
I do love you.

311
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,595
I'm fucking bored of the little boy!

312
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,795
Why can't you be a man?

313
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,710
You're a miserable, lying shit.

314
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,151
I hate you.

315
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,076
I'll meet you downstairs.

316
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,956
- And cut!
- Camera's cut.

317
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,593
Check the gate.

318
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,836
Could we do it again? I didn't quite feel it.

319
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,636
- There's no time, darling. Fix it in post.
- Oh, all right.

320
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,834
This way, Mrs Sellers.

321
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,675
Oh, Peter, I love you so much.

322
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,872
I'm so sorry I hurt you.
I should never have slept with Ted.

323
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,074
You're the best lover I ever had. I'm going
to tell Ted I never want to see him again.

324
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,357
Then we'll go out and eat a sumptuous meal.

325
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,391
Then I'll make love to you

326
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,796
like no wife has ever made love
to her husband before.

327
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,830
I'm just going to freshen up and then...

328
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,276
<i>I'll meet you downstairs</i>.

329
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,316
That's much better.

330
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,596
She's gone, Mum.

331
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,795
You're all right. You're with Peg now.

332
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,870
I thought if I just gave the world a little push,

333
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,116
it would all fall into place.

334
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,075
Well, at least you tried, dear.

335
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,676
Perhaps I should call Anne.

336
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,240
She left you. Let her go.

337
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,470
I just don't know what's going to happen next.

338
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,270
Don't you worry, my little boy.

339
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,911
The future's ours now.
And there are many ways of finding it.

340
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,470
Turn the light out, Bill.

341
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,834
Mr Sellers?

342
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,354
Maurice Woodruff. You wish to see me.

343
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,074
Roger Moore speaks very highly of you.

344
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,637
As he should. Come. The future is this way.

345
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,713
You are aware that green
is the unluckiest colour in the spectrum?

346
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,512
- It is?
- It's positively fatal.

347
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,959
- You feel better.
- Immensely.

348
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,473
So, what else is troubling you?

349
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,433
You're the fortune-teller.
Shouldn't you already know?

350
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,599
Even fortune's pump needs priming.

351
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,874
I keep making changes.

352
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,434
You know. Big ones.

353
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,156
And little ones. Always hoping
that the next one will be the right one.

354
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,430
I lost weight, I bought new clothes.

355
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,473
I changed my radio job for a film career.

356
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,670
I changed my marriage into a divorce.

357
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,517
Nothing makes me happy
the way I'm supposed to be happy.

358
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,155
One can't be happy if one's lonely.

359
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,591
The spirits are telling me

360
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,314
that there will be
many pretty ladies in your life.

361
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,192
You see, Peter...
You don't mind if I call you Peter?

362
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,309
No.

363
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,510
You like pretty ladies.

364
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,389
You're quite a perceptive man, Maurice.

365
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,751
Hello, ladies.

366
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,110
Yes, it is me.

367
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,797
A very good day to you, sir.
Welcome to our showroom.

368
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,753
It's absolutely delightful.

369
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,071
As you can see,
we do have all the latest models.

370
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,398
- This is a sporty little number.
- Superb.

371
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,072
Or perhaps something more along these lines.

372
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,989
- Big grille on this one.
- Oh, yes, I have one myself, sir.

373
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,270
- May I?
- Please.

374
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,231
The Germans are amazing, aren't they?

375
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,191
How about engine noise?

376
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,754
She'll growl when you're hard on the floor, sir.

377
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,555
Rest of the time, silent as a kitten.

378
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,955
So, what will it take
to get sir into one of these today?

379
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,109
A test drive.

380
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,554
Emma, how fast d'you run the quarter mile?

381
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,073
- Honestly, Mr Sellers.
- Thank you, Emma. That'll be all.

382
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,438
Blake Edwards. He's shooting
a David Niven movie in Rome and Switzerland.

383
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,191
Starts filming next week. Wants you.

384
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,949
Next week? He obviously
hasn't wanted me for that long.

385
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,311
It's a supporting part.
Peter Ustinov's pulled out.

386
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,878
Oh, well, yes, of course I'll do it.

387
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,913
Any part not good enough for Ustinov
is perfectly fine for me.

388
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,112
- Peter...
- I'm not taking Ustinov's sloppy seconds!

389
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,312
I won a fucking British Academy Award,
for God's sake!

390
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,514
Are you going to overreact or listen
to why your smart agent wants you to do this?

391
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,835
Apparently, I'm going to overreact.

392
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,911
God.

393
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,030
Blake Edwards is the hottest director
in Hollywood right now.

394
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,038
Days Of Wine And Roses,
Breakfast At Tiffany's.

395
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,073
He can get anyone he wants.
And, Peter, he wants you.

396
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,639
United Artists are putting
a lot of weight behind it.

397
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,957
It's going to get very wide,
very international release.

398
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,437
You may be a star in Britain, but the folks
in Duluth have never heard of you.

399
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,199
Well, we're even. I've never heard of Duluth.

400
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,436
It's in the United States.

401
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,554
That Duluth.

402
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,750
It's called The Pink Panther.

403
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,710
It sounds like a bloody strip joint.

404
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,591
For poofs.

405
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,836
Please. Try mine.

406
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,159
Excuse me, but aren't you Peter Sellers?

407
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,071
Not today.

408
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,795
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to make
our final approach into Rome International.

409
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,313
Please take your seat, sir.

410
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,036
Please ensure your seat belts
are fastened and your seats are upright.

411
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,232
I'm looking for my tru-ung.

412
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,800
- Your tru-ung?
- What?

413
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,674
- You said "tru-ung"?
- I know perfectly well what I said.

414
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,598
Right. I don't understand.

415
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,314
Are you not familiar
with Her Majesty's tu-ung?

416
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,953
Yes, I am.

417
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,709
And I can assure you the word "tru-ung"

418
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,354
does not exist in our language.

419
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,994
Then I demand to speak
to the person in charge.

420
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,430
- I am the person in charge, sir.
- Then I demand to speak with you.

421
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,075
- You are speaking to me.
- Of course I am speaking with you.

422
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,955
What kind of a crazy stewardess thinks
a passenger stands, speaking with himself?

423
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,959
What kind of a passenger puts lives at risk
just before a landing?

424
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,230
Our lives are at risk?

425
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,396
Our lives are not at risk.

426
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,798
Now sit down and belt up.
I'm getting completely lost.

427
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,797
Lost?

428
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,957
Yes, we have a slight state of emergency.

429
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,799
French twa...

430
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,152
I want you to go very quietly
and spik with the peelot.

431
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,111
- Peelot?
- What?

432
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,550
- You said "peelot".
- I know very well what I said.

433
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,151
I have a funny feeling we might be
landing in Rome sooner than we think.

434
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,675
You be careful, Mr Sellers.

435
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,153
Carol, our guest has arrived.
Will you take his coat, please?

436
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,518
And he also looks a little thirsty, Gill.

437
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,231
Ah, yes, Switzerland. Of course.

438
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,630
Hi. Blake Edwards.

439
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,950
Running things on a shoestring, I see.

440
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,674
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- This is Italy.

441
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,870
Hollywood is a state of mind.

442
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,595
I've got one or two ideas about Clouseau.
Couple of bits...

443
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,349
Peter. The script will be shot as written.

444
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,392
- Yes, but in the bedroom scene...
- I mean it.

445
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,551
Look at his...

446
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,875
OK. You look great. Let's shoot this.

447
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,831
This is where we introduce Clouseau

448
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,077
and we tip off the audience
that your wife is David's mistress.

449
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,636
We're in a hurry.
We only have Niven until two o'clock

450
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,433
so we'd like to get it in one take. Ready?

451
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,394
OK. He's only got one line.
Keep him in the frame, whatever he does.

452
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,476
Henri, you wanna take your mark?

453
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,388
- OK.
- 192. Eight, take one.

454
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,430
Action.

455
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,874
We must find that woman.

456
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,509
Is that what you said?

457
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,358
Tell me you got that.

458
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,917
Testing. On the set of
The Pink Panther in Gstaad, Switzerland,

459
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,110
with Peter Sellers.

460
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,839
Peter, how are you able
to inhabit your characters so successfully?

461
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,112
Well, you see, I don't really have
any personality of my own.

462
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,753
There used to be a me behind the mask
but I had it surgically removed.

463
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,871
I don't know. If I didn't have characters
like Clouseau, I don't know who I'd be.

464
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,788
Perhaps I'd be you.
But then if I were you, who would you be?

465
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,078
You.

466
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,191
That's very good.

467
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,791
So, word is, you're stealing this movie
from David Niven.

468
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,831
No, no, that's ridiculous.

469
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,838
This... this is such a team effort.

470
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,272
David Niven is one of the cinema's
most distinguished leading men.

471
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,391
One can learn a lot from people
like that, you know.

472
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,720
Terrific, Blake. Talk tomorrow about that.

473
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,033
Good show. The Frogs will never
forgive you. Well done.

474
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,435
- Thank you, David.
- Genius.

475
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,434
I'm not supposed to tell you but United Artists
already wants a Clouseau sequel.

476
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,552
- Who's directing?
- Oh, probably some hack.

477
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,390
- I'm dead fucking serious.
- Peter, relax.

478
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,273
- You're not suggesting you would?
- What?

479
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,030
I was bloody awful up there. If that's what you
get out of me, I don't want to repeat it.

480
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,118
- You blame me for your performance?
- You agree I was awful?

481
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,118
- I thought you were brilliant!
- What the fuck do you know?

482
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,596
Peter, we're all going out.
You just have to come.

483
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,231
Ah, hello.

484
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,351
- Yung Hi.
- So Mi.

485
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,109
Oh, that's so you.
I knew there was a pronoun involved.

486
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,871
Blakey, aren't you coming?

487
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,195
<i>Crowds continue to flock</i>
<i>to see The Pink Panther</i>.

488
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,950
<i>One avid patron, waiting in line</i>
<i>to see the film for the third time,</i>

489
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,470
<i>was heard to remark, "I love foreign films</i>.

490
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,957
<i>"Peter Sellers is my absolute</i>
<i>favourite French actor. "</i>

491
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,390
Peter. Oh, you've got a hit.
You shouldn't be here.

492
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,873
- How long has he been like this?
- Since last Monday.

493
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,914
You didn't tell me.

494
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,278
Pete...

495
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,511
Peg said you couldn't come.

496
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,229
Well, I'm here now, Dad.

497
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,916
Pete...

498
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,996
Bloke in the next bed...

499
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,990
I promised him your autograph.

500
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,631
- I'll get right onto that, Dad.
- Yeah. He'll like that.

501
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,076
I told him...

502
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,271
my son...

503
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,435
who's a special boy...

504
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,117
No. No, let him rest now.

505
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,436
Let him rest.

506
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,958
The reporters. They'll want some remarks.

507
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,793
You didn't call me.

508
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,436
Hello. Is Mike there?

509
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,591
Do you know when he'll be back?

510
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,711
All right. No, it's... Bye.

511
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,829
- Is Harry there, please?
- <i>It's Harry. How are you?</i>

512
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,679
I'm fine. I'm looking after Mike.
I thought you might like to pop over for a beer.

513
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,229
Oh. Oh, is that today? I forgot, yeah.

514
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,318
- <i>Why don't we say Monday?</i>
- Er, right.

515
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,556
- <i>Ying ton, mate</i>.
- Iddle i po!

516
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,637
Mike, put that down. Put it down, please.

517
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,671
Thank you.

518
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,676
Go to your room.

519
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,791
Oh, Bert, you swine.

520
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,871
Here it is, here it is.

521
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,275
Welcome to my humble chapeau.

522
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,957
God.

523
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,355
I don't seem to be able to get it in.

524
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,111
What's going on?

525
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,558
Good evening, Mr Sellers.

526
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,393
Oh, Christ!

527
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,159
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

528
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,475
You're a hard man to get ahold of.

529
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,629
- Not really.
- Oh, God.

530
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,513
Linda, I'd like you to meet Stanley Kubrick.

531
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,631
It's nice to meet you.

532
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,429
So, er, Columbia won't let me
make my next picture without you.

533
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,630
Awfully insightful of them.

534
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,476
What's the part?

535
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,475
All of them.

536
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,591
What, the whole film?

537
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,914
You can destroy the world, Peter.

538
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,478
Fine. I can hear you now, Dmitri,
clear and plain and coming through fine.

539
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,070
Yes, it's good that you're fine and I'm fine.

540
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,477
And I agree with you, it's great to be fine.

541
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,356
Now, then, Dmitri...

542
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,797
You know how we've always talked

543
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,038
about the possibility of something
going wrong with the bomb?

544
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,876
The hydrogen bomb.

545
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,959
Now, what happened is,
one of our base commanders,

546
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,150
he had a sort of...

547
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,678
Well, he went a little funny in the head.

548
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,711
Just a little funny.

549
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,275
You know, and he went and did a silly thing.

550
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,638
Oh, now, don't be mad at me, Dmitri.

551
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,911
Remember that time
we were dancing with Natalia?

552
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,033
You remember Natalia,
the girl with the huge... arthritic problem.

553
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,637
Sorry, Stan.

554
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,678
I can assure you...
I can assure you, Major Bat Guano -

555
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,597
if that is indeed your name -

556
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,712
if you don't put that gun away
and stop this nonsense,

557
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,719
the court inquiry is gonna come down
on you like a ton of bricks.

558
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,549
The court inquiry is gonna...
give you such a pranging.

559
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,192
- Mr Sellers.
- Hilary.

560
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,233
- What happened to my luncheon?
- Your mother's here.

561
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,150
Shall I tell her you're in make-up?

562
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,715
No, I'll be right there.

563
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,070
You missed Sarah's birthday.

564
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,953
Peter, you know the press
pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing.

565
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,153
You know, liebchen,
that is not chicken that you are eating.

566
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,350
Anyway, I told the man at The Times
that you were busy filming,

567
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,712
that you'd sent your love and nothing was
more important to you than your children.

568
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,035
I think he was satisfied with that.

569
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,030
Sarah made you that.

570
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,556
Eat your lunch.

571
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,073
You know, in ze comink years,

572
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,555
ze nuclear family as we know it

573
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,436
will have ceased to exist.

574
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,150
All human requirements...

575
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,755
will be dealt with cleanly and efficiently.

576
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,398
Nourishment.

577
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,270
Leisure pastimes.

578
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,750
Sexual partners.

579
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,551
All zeez problems
vill be regulated by ze state.

580
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,434
So you see there will be no need for food.

581
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,270
Or mothers...

582
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,397
How was lunch with your son, Mrs Sellers?

583
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,876
I don't know, really. I didn't see him.

584
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,077
- Anybody home?
- In here.

585
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,510
- Hello, you.
- Annie, Annie darling.

586
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,391
- Sarah Sellers?
- I'm Sarah.

587
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,920
Oh. There you go, then, deary.

588
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,631
Let's have a look.

589
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,992
"For Sarah. Maybe one day
I'll teach you to ride it. Love, Daddy."

590
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,190
Just sign here, madam.

591
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,790
Go and have a look, love. Thanks.

592
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,114
"Boys. Boy, I say, boy. I say, boy.

593
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,949
"Boys, let's get this on the hump.
We got some flyin' to do."

594
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,878
- Flatter.
- I'm not playing a bomber pilot.

595
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,276
What can I do with that,
crammed in there? Oh, look.

596
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,356
Let me just hear it again.

597
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,836
Three characters is enough.
Three is a good number.

598
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,748
- You're being paid for four.
- You're stretching me too thin.

599
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,269
Who do you think I am?

600
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,516
I think you're whoever I want you to be.

601
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,870
Then who am I now?

602
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,917
Peter, have you ever heard
of Mutually Assured Destruction?

603
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,431
Hum a few bars and I'll join in.

604
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,795
It refers to when both sides
in an atomic conflict are so powerful

605
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,480
that if either side were to take action,

606
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,549
it would inevitably result
in the total annihilation of all concerned.

607
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,070
I find this concept
can be applied to many situations.

608
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,354
You're a peculiar fucker, Stan.

609
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,516
Wait. Peter...

610
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,271
Peter...

611
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,313
Can we have the ladders, please?
Finish off this painting.

612
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,435
You've got no idea what it's like to be me.

613
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,915
We haven't got time for that.

614
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,956
Absolute control is a useful thing.

615
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,955
Eliminate the personal element...
and you can get so much more done.

616
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,394
This was a realisation
that Peter Sellers never had to face...

617
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,152
because there was
no person there to begin with.

618
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,670
He was a vessel

619
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:25,238
into which characters
and personalities ran like phantoms.

620
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,673
But even an empty vessel can become too full.

621
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,316
I'm not getting it!

622
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,231
I'm useless!

623
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:51,519
Sarah, your father is a useless,
talentless, empty man. Did you know that?

624
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,592
Yes, Daddy.

625
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,471
Right, then.

626
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,152
- Dad?
- Use the other loo, Mike. I'm busy.

627
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,116
I don't have to go, Dad.

628
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,390
Please open the door.

629
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,280
- What d'you want?
- Are you all right?

630
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,430
No. I'm not all right. I'm not all right at all.

631
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,951
I can't find the voice for Major King Kong.
That's all I'm hired for.

632
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,230
I can't find it because it's not there!

633
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,829
- Dad.
- Your dad doesn't exist!

634
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,034
Where's the bloody Seconal?

635
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,313
Dad. When I didn't want
to play rugby at school,

636
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,590
I said I was sick when I wasn't.

637
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,394
They let me sit in the nurse's office.
She was very pretty.

638
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,871
Was she?

639
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,110
Morning, Stan.

640
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,438
I'm afraid I had a spot of bother
getting out of a cab last night.

641
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,315
Damned nuisance.

642
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,194
The doctor assures me
it's only a hairline crack.

643
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,549
Just don't let the insurance chaps find out.

644
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:11,998
Blake Edwards has got this new Panther script

645
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,036
and Sellers is waffling,
so if you could help convince him to do it...

646
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,991
Exactly. What?

647
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,790
Blake Edwards.

648
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,878
<i>My girl will wire the money today</i>.
<i>What's the account?</i>

649
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,030
The Midland Bank, Mayfair branch.
Account number 462501.

650
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,912
<i>Right. Thanks</i>.

651
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,999
Not at all. Pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, a word of advice -

652
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:45,079
don't even think of driving
a red or a white car this weekend.

653
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,236
Not at all.

654
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,390
So...

655
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,431
Pink Panther.

656
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,396
No. No, too obvious.

657
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,310
Blake Edwards.

658
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,358
B.E.

659
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,392
Well, hooray for Hollywood.

660
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,071
That's extraordinary. Peter, this is good news.

661
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,988
You're going to become involved
with a very special person.

662
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,998
It's going to spawn a very fruitful partnership.

663
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,118
I'm even getting the initials.

664
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,277
It's... Ah! V-E.

665
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,358
It's V-P... V-E.

666
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,994
V-P, V-E. No! B... B-E.

667
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,390
Peter, you must not let this person go.

668
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,719
Destiny's already written this chapter.
You must act positively.

669
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,231
Yeah? So, say with me, "B-E."

670
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,031
Mr Sellers, sir?

671
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,436
God. What?

672
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,750
Mr Sellers, are you in there?

673
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,035
- Mr Sellers?
- Go away.

674
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:52,155
- Are you sure you're all right, sir?
- Yes, I am.

675
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,558
Just take your fresh fruit
and shove it up your arse.

676
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,194
Righto, sir. Thank you very much, sir.

677
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,191
Britt Ekland.

678
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,111
Hello, Britt. You must be Britt.

679
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,674
You're Britt Ekland!

680
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,438
I'm Peter.

681
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,835
Peter Sellers. But call me Peter.

682
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,951
Baby.

683
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,957
Oh, sorry.

684
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,759
B-E.

685
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,838
PS. That's nice.

686
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,077
I like Swedes. Mashed.

687
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,271
Hello.

688
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,709
I'm Peter. Peter Sellers.

689
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,910
Like you, I didn't have much on this evening

690
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,713
and I wanted to know
if you'd like to go and see a movie.

691
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,356
I think I'm in love with you.

692
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,270
But you've just met me.

693
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,275
Then it's still fresh in my mind.

694
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,432
Cookie?

695
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,278
Yes, please.

696
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,515
That is very, very good. Just look here. Super.

697
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,552
Super. Yes, that's... Now, just look here.

698
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,433
Look here. Good. Very nice.

699
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,235
I'll come in closer.
It's all right, I've met this sofa.

700
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,316
We're on intimate terms.

701
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,474
Work with me. That is good.

702
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,673
Thinks, "Must take up photography
as full-time job."

703
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,837
Now I need to get in closer.
Come the full length.

704
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,235
Yeah. Mind if I sit here?

705
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,868
Oh, God, I haven't felt leather like this
on my thighs since the Third Reich.

706
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,911
Good. Get rid of that there.

707
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,590
Truly, truly beautiful.

708
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,519
She is the most extraordinary girl.
Like a tulip about to bloom.

709
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,029
Absolutely exquisite.

710
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,071
Phenomenal in bed.

711
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,189
It is funny, isn't it?

712
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,393
I keep saying that I'll never get hooked
again, I'm tired of having my heart bleed,

713
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,670
yet I think I want to marry her.

714
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,516
That is, if you think it's OK.

715
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,953
Oh, decisions, decisions.

716
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:09,631
- Will you come to my suite, my sweet.
- Drive on, James! Now!

717
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,550
Ooh, it's the cops. Act normal.

718
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,399
It's all right, Officer, I'm fully licensed.

719
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,313
Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling.

720
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,955
Care to put on some music, love?

721
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,311
- It doesn't work.
- Don't trouble yourself, sweetheart.

722
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,432
There are many ways
of making beautiful music.

723
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,039
Cheers.

724
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,394
It's a bit dark in here. Could you
get the curtains, darling? It's that switch.

725
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,789
What d'you say? Would you care
to become the second Mrs Sellers?

726
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,189
Better hurry up, love. I've only
got the band for another half-hour.

727
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,076
I love you, Peter!

728
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,632
Do you hear that, folks?

729
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,718
- She loves me on a scratched film.
- Here we go!

730
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,516
Peg, what do you think of the new cottage?

731
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,792
- You're watering the gin.
- In your case, that's not a bad idea.

732
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,600
You've only known that Nazi for three weeks.

733
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,790
Peg, I couldn't be happier.

734
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,479
Why are you making
the same mistake all over again?

735
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,512
Because, my love, they won't let me marry you.

736
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,556
Mr Sellers, how's about
a shot of you and your mum?

737
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,477
So, where's your honeymoon?

738
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,512
Where else, Peg? Hollywood, US of A.

739
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,996
- Happy, darling?
- I'm about to be.

740
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,473
Oh, that's good!

741
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,639
Oh, that's good! Oh, my God!
You're very good, you know.

742
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,796
Wait. Wait. Wait.

743
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,000
- No. Oh.
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe in.

744
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,435
Are you sure you're my wife?

745
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,790
What do you mean?

746
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,151
Because no wife should be
that good in the sack.

747
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,830
Is that what I look like?

748
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,311
Just one minute.

749
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,831
Peter.

750
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,713
- Britt, call a doctor, would you?
- Peter...

751
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,990
Send for the anaesthetist.

752
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,075
Just try to breathe, Peter.

753
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,954
Would you wait outside, Mrs Sellers?
It's gonna be fine. Please.

754
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,231
He's arrested.

755
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,079
- OK, let's charge to 120.
- 120.

756
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,755
Clear.

757
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,792
- No pulse.
- Come on.

758
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,233
...<i>Peter Sellers,</i>
<i>fighting for his life in a California hospital</i>.

759
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,158
<i>Mr Sellers has suffered a serious setback</i>.

760
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,955
<i>His condition is said to be</i>
<i>grave and deteriorating</i>.

761
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,078
No pulse.

762
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,591
Clear.

763
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,711
There you go.

764
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,631
Oh, God, Mother.

765
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,558
Mother, we've only been married for six weeks.

766
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,355
They don't know.

767
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,277
I don't know.

768
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,790
Damn! He's gone again.

769
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,514
- OK, charge to 180.
- 180.

770
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,558
Clear.

771
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:19,515
<i>We have been informed</i>
<i>that his father also succumbed</i>...

772
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,918
<i>Having come to fame some years ago</i>
<i>as a member of The Goon Show</i>...

773
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,031
Both channels.

774
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,319
- Clear.
- Still no pulse.

775
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,829
- Charge to 240.
- 240.

776
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,991
Clear.

777
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,470
Come on, Peter, come on.

778
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,153
Please do give my regards to your president.

779
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,840
And I thought I knew something about...

780
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,678
The Doomsday machine...

781
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,950
You've had a little too much...

782
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,675
It is essential that we do not have fear...

783
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,360
Perhaps a little...

784
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,471
I have no hesitation, categorically...

785
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,556
I don't care...

786
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,355
You've got enough on at the moment
without having any more piled on.

787
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,993
Tell the world.

788
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,192
- They mentioned something...
- On the one hand...

789
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,674
Watch out!

790
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,552
Comrades, the meeting is closed.

791
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,192
There will be ten females to every male.

792
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,997
- I'm out of here, mate.
- I think so.

793
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,873
...for the burmb.
- Oh, Mein Führer!

794
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,389
Oh, goodness me. I'm a man!

795
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,838
Yeah!

796
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,038
OK, we got him back.

797
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,310
Let's get an IV in.

798
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,071
Hello, children.

799
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,196
Can I have a little fairy kiss?

800
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,876
The spirits have spoken.

801
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,790
Daddy's come back from the dead.

802
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,433
And nothing can ever hurt him again.

803
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,391
Peter?

804
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,797
Peter?

805
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,438
Come on. Good boy.

806
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,196
Peter!

807
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,476
You're still weak.

808
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,989
This isn't taking care of yourself.

809
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,272
From now on there'll be
no more characters, no more costumes.

810
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,070
Starting next week,

811
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,829
the world's going to get
a look at the real Peter Sellers.

812
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,834
What's next week?

813
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:51,239
Who are you?
How did you get past my guards?

814
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,069
Good evening, darling.
My name is Bond. James Bond.

815
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,151
You know.

816
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,198
Aren't you going to do something... funny?

817
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,196
- Cut!
- First positions everyone!

818
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,711
How we doing, Pete?

819
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,469
Feel free to, er, improvise.

820
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,670
We're doing a spoof here, remember.

821
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,750
I'm playing it straight, as myself.
Like Cary Grant.

822
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,670
That's funny. Yeah.

823
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,313
That's... that's very good.
Yeah. Yeah. Satirical, yeah.

824
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,996
Good evening. My name's Bond.

825
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,471
James Bond.

826
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,276
My God, but you're lovely.

827
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,711
That was great!

828
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,831
Genius.

829
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,840
We meet again. I knew you wouldn't give up.

830
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,795
- Christ, Peter. When are you coming back?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

831
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,799
Seeing as we're three weeks
behind schedule, yeah, I would.

832
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,669
You know, Joe, I think today is not a lucky day.

833
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,190
Not lucky at all.
The voices are telling me not to risk it.

834
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:07,269
I hear voices, too, Peter!
And d'you know what they tell me?

835
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,870
They tell me that if you're not on the set
by this afternoon,

836
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,389
both your legs are gonna be broken!

837
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,950
I don't think we're hearing the same voices.

838
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,393
Peter, you wanker! Get back here! Now!

839
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,756
- Hello.
- Just answering nature's call.

840
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,915
I'm not feeling very well.

841
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,956
Darling, there are lots of other bathrooms
in the house.

842
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,230
That's not what I meant.

843
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,116
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

844
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,469
Oh, well,

845
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,909
I suppose you'll have to... you know.

846
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,716
What?

847
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,719
Well, have an abortion, sweetheart.
I'm sure it can be arranged.

848
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,593
No. I want this child.

849
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,475
I've got two already. Have one of mine.

850
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,593
Peter, I want to be a mother to our child.

851
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:11,713
I've always... given you room
for what you needed.

852
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,115
- Darling, is now the right time?
- Yes.

853
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,991
You are healthy.

854
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,475
We are in love.

855
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,955
Oh, Peter, let's have this baby.

856
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,478
- Bombs away.
- Plop.

857
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,791
Well, you hurry up.

858
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,916
And I'll go and call Mother.

859
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,870
Keep breathing, love.

860
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,991
The hospital's just up ahead...

861
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,355
I think.

862
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,270
All right, lads, give her some air.

863
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,549
Oh, we're fine, thank you.

864
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:37,593
- How d'you feel third time around?
- Ecstatic, absolutely thrilling.

865
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,596
You'll be fine. Just make it quick.

866
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:49,840
- We start filming in a week.
- Don't you worry, you'll be all right.

867
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,711
I'll take care of you now.

868
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,715
Goddammit!

869
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,836
Cut!

870
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,719
Take the fucking baby
and get the hell off the set.

871
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,990
Please. She's fine now.

872
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,475
- Off!
- No.

873
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,670
My big scene is coming up.

874
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,556
Not any more.

875
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,750
Fine. You do it. Ciao.

876
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,913
- Yes.
- <i>Is that my Peter?</i>

877
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,953
Hello, Peg. What's the news from the front?

878
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,476
I'm in hospital.

879
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,358
It's the old heart, Peter.

880
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,790
Oh, well, we all know about that one, dear.
You'll be up in no time.

881
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,956
That's not what the doctors say.

882
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,991
<i>They're trying to bump up their fee</i>.

883
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:21,069
If they say you're dying, when you walk out
they can claim they saved your life.

884
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,918
<i>Come home, love. I need to see you</i>.

885
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,671
Nonsense, Peg.

886
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,509
All you need is a wash and brush-up
and you'll be as good as new.

887
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:37,154
No, it's not like that. Listen...

888
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,476
Just a minute.

889
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,000
Your boy's needed, Peg. You understand.

890
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,111
I'm a star now.

891
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,549
These people can't do a thing without me.

892
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,515
It's everything you ever wanted.

893
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,636
I love you, Peter.

894
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,473
I'll see you soon. We'll go to tea.

895
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,352
<i>Peter?</i>

896
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,274
See how strong he was.

897
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:51,030
Most men would have crumpled at,
"I love you, Peter."

898
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,196
But not my son.

899
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,155
He came through like a champion.

900
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,158
A star has an obligation to himself.

901
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,710
Family weighs you down.

902
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,154
You think he was cruel to me?
Of course he was.

903
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,158
That just means that he'd learnt his lesson.

904
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:40,273
There are no rungs for the weak
on the ladder of success.

905
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,879
And my Peter is a strong climber.

906
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,435
Real stars don't have time for tears.

907
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,515
Can I get you anything, my darling?

908
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,071
Oh, Peter.

909
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,669
There's nothing you could have done.

910
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,430
It's not your fault.

911
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,036
"It's not your fault.

912
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,830
"There's nothing you could have done."

913
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,351
- Oh, Peter, stop it.
- "Oh, Peter, stop it. Stop it, Peter."

914
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,310
Christ, woman, can't you say anything real?

915
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,759
First of all you can't act, then you can't stop.

916
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,030
- You...
- Just shut up!

917
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,719
- You bastard!
- Am I? Am I?

918
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,594
- You've no idea.
- Fuck you!

919
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,711
No! Fuck you!

920
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,991
You hit me with me mum.

921
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,758
Fuck you, Peter!

922
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,950
Fuck you and your mum!

923
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,511
Mama, mama, mama, mama.

924
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,958
Pretty num-num.

925
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,951
Oh, dear.

926
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,469
Well, Mr Sellers,

927
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,636
what would you like to look like?

928
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,955
Why, Doctor, I'd like to look like you.

929
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,750
<i>You know how they clean theatres?</i>

930
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,998
<i>They put on one of my films</i>.
<i>It's so easy to hoover between empty seats</i>.

931
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,476
Now I've found something I really want to do

932
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,239
and I can't get anyone to give me the cash.

933
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,954
I've read this ten times in the last year.

934
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,913
The main character is a man with no self.

935
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,110
No discernible personality.

936
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,874
I find myself thinking
about this man a great deal.

937
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,638
About how sad he is?

938
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,991
No, about how marvellous his life must be.

939
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,953
He has no future, no past, no responsibilities.

940
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,677
He's simple, boring, an absolute blank.

941
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,349
People expect nothing from him
and love it when they get just that.

942
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,435
This is going to be my next film.

943
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,314
- Are you absolutely sure about that?
- Absolutely.

944
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,551
Cos you do have a choice, you know.

945
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:38,272
- Have you read it?
- I've made some notes.

946
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,350
I think it could be very funny.

947
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,679
I don't like choice, Maurice.

948
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,596
You're so full of doubt.

949
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,470
How can we make that doubt go away?

950
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,190
We know, don't we?

951
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:57,236
Peg? Peg, can you hear me?

952
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,871
Peg sees you, Peter.

953
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,351
Hello, Peg.

954
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,869
I love you, Peg.

955
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,275
What do you need from me, dear?

956
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,630
I don't know what to do next.

957
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,151
My heart's been troubling me.

958
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,033
And I think, I think my mind...

959
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,436
Peg's here.

960
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,755
She's always with you, Peter.

961
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,950
Now I've had a look at your heart

962
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,150
and your heart's fine.

963
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,396
Now what you need to do is work.

964
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,795
You give so much joy
to so many people, Peter.

965
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,990
I can see it from here.

966
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,989
Do it for me, for your mother.

967
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,916
Do another Pink Panther.

968
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:54,152
Are you sure, Peg? Are you really sure?

969
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,510
Lt'll be a huge hit.

970
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:03,119
And that'll give you the power
to make Being There.

971
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:24,029
I hear this one's not coming
to a theatre near me.

972
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:29,550
The studio deemed
its box-office potential as limited.

973
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,318
Then I suppose this comes
at just the right time.

974
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,472
I could never be this broke.

975
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,434
It wasn't easy for me to come here, Peter.

976
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,190
Why, did your limousine break down?

977
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,675
I considered making you kiss my ass.

978
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,439
Not after that script's been through it.

979
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,915
Still the funniest bastard around.

980
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,474
Look, Peter, I didn't come out of desperation.

981
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,037
I think it's a good idea and I can't do it
without you. You need the money, I don't.

982
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,630
And I don't need the aggravation
that you're gonna bring me.

983
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,871
What if I told you to fuck off?

984
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,670
I'd say your ex-wives will be
disappointed in that attitude.

985
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,279
- Fuck my ex-wives.
- I have.

986
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,198
Now I know why you divorced 'em.

987
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:33,352
Blakey! You are the only
son of a bitch who really understands me.

988
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,040
- God. I love you.
- I love you, Peter.

989
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,196
How sad is that?

990
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,868
This script could be terrific.
We'll give it the Sellers-Edwards touch.

991
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,470
- I've got lots of ideas.
- We start shooting in six weeks.

992
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,030
Better make it eight.

993
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,795
Peter... I'm calling the shots here.

994
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,150
Darling! Over here!

995
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,071
This is sure to be another
stunning success. How does it feel?

996
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,112
- Well-deserved, I can assure you.
- Thank you.

997
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,356
Hello, Blakey. Is this going to be
your usual load of rubbish?

998
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:01,952
Hello, my dear friends.
Thank you for coming out tonight.

999
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,436
I have something I'd like very much
to say to you all.

1000
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,031
We would not all be here
if it were not for the efforts of one man -

1001
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:24,598
one man whose vision you will soon
see writ large on the silver screen.

1002
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,313
I am of course referring to Mr Blake Edwards.

1003
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,472
Get him up here, folks.

1004
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,398
Come on, Blakey. Up you come.

1005
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,351
Jolly good.

1006
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:41,272
- Come on!
- Thank you!

1007
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,071
Thank you!

1008
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,035
Let me tell you something about this man.

1009
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:53,039
He is absolutely talentless.

1010
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:56,157
No, but seriously, no one - and I repeat that -

1011
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:03,310
no one has managed to do so much,
having so very little.

1012
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,428
Give me that.

1013
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,233
People ask me
why I compromise my artistic integrity

1014
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,590
by walking in front of Blake's cameras.

1015
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:16,677
You know what I tell them? Money.

1016
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,590
It's true.

1017
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,437
That and the knowledge that
no matter how bad the picture is,

1018
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,790
I'll always be the best thing in it.

1019
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,917
- Thank you.
- Oh, look, he's bashful, folks.

1020
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:36,673
Why shouldn't he be?
In an industry that worships mediocrity,

1021
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,712
you, Blake, truly have added new lustre

1022
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,037
to the term "middling talent".

1023
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,593
So enjoy the show... if that's at all possible.

1024
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,831
I...

1025
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,116
I knew we should've gotten Ustinov.

1026
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:54,798
<i>The ambitious Sellers</i>
<i>presents a portrait of determination</i>.

1027
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,354
<i>You've reached the home of Peter Sellers</i>.

1028
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:05,036
<i>Mr Sellers is unable to take your call,</i>
<i>as he is off leading a normal life</i>.

1029
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,913
<i>Please leave your message</i>
<i>after the series of tones</i>.

1030
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,275
<i>Oh. Hi, Dad, it's me, Mike</i>.

1031
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,439
<i>I tried you on the phone but Sarah</i>
<i>thought you might be in Switzerland</i>.

1032
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:19,872
<i>Anyway, Mum told me about the operation,</i>
<i>the pacemaker and everything</i>.

1033
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,151
<i>That must be fun</i>.
<i>I know how you like gadgets</i>.

1034
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:27,557
<i>Well, anyway, I hope you're, er, you're OK</i>.

1035
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,278
<i>Right, take care, Dad. Bye</i>.

1036
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,759
I'm just an old, salty sea dog.

1037
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:33,195
Peter, are you in there?

1038
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,994
Will you give me a goddamn break already?

1039
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:49,398
You know something, Sellers,
you are a major league pain in the ass.

1040
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,271
Peter!

1041
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,793
Was he difficult? He was the star -
of course he was difficult.

1042
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,478
You know who's not difficult? Troy Donahue.

1043
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,038
Christ. I need a smoke.

1044
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:21,150
I worked with Sellers for what,
20 years, on and off?

1045
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:28,154
Six movies.

1046
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:30,475
I never laughed so hard.

1047
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,390
I never cried so hard.

1048
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,436
The last straw?
There were endless last straws.

1049
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:43,439
You say, "last straw",
five seconds later you're saying, "Action".

1050
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:47,951
I can't explain it. It was like watching a cobra.

1051
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,671
You're mesmerised.

1052
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,670
What did he do after me?

1053
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,914
The only thing he never gave up on.

1054
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,274
They all wanted me to be a clown.

1055
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:14,110
They'll pay me millions to be a French,
mustachioed, karate-chopping twit.

1056
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,834
But this is so much more.

1057
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,315
What do you want to do, Peter?

1058
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,835
Isn't that what I just asked you?

1059
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,917
Oh, shut up.

1060
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,439
Yowser.

1061
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,399
Ain't you the gentleman this mornin'?

1062
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,551
I'm gonna go now.

1063
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,071
Yes.

1064
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,556
You're gonna need somebody.

1065
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:39,033
You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance.

1066
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:42,634
Guess it oughta be an old lady,

1067
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:46,753
cos you ain't gonna
do a young one any good.

1068
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,872
Not with that little thing of yours.

1069
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,632
You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?

1070
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,951
Bye, Chance.

1071
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:19,111
Bye, Louise.

1072
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,519
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Aren't you Peter Sellers?

1073
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:43,830
- Yes, I am.
- Would you mind?

1074
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:56,754
Thank you. Thank you very much. I mean,
you... you were... the man. That's it.

1075
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,953
<i>You're always gonna be a little boy,</i>
<i>ain't you?</i>

1076
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,751
<i>Bye, Chance</i>.

1077
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,311
<i>Bye, Louise</i>.

1078
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,070
Mr Edwards.
Pardon me, but have you seen Mr Sellers?

1079
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,395
No, and he's 20 minutes late. Did he call?

1080
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,431
No. He's here.

1081
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:47,755
I think maybe you should see him.

1082
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,392
Peter?

1083
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,871
You can't come in here.
