1
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,297
You are all going to Hell!

2
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,965
Only God Almighty can save you.

3
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,470
Come rise out of
your physical refuge!

4
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,940
Read his holy words
before it's too late!

5
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,641
Satan and his minions
are hungry now.

6
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,976
Even as we speak,
the Devil's whisper is...

7
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,345
diabolical whenever
he's in your ears.

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,045
Time is running out!
The end is nigh.

9
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,951
There is evil
all around you.

10
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,320
All you have to do is look.

11
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,588
There is temptation
in every corner of our lives.

12
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,661
Wickedness, abomination,
corruption of the soul!

13
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,557
No one is safe,
especially the unbeliever.

14
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,263
The shadows grow long
on the road of pain...

15
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:03,082
I had a very difficult procedure
with Esther Anquist the other day.

16
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,914
That goddamned van of yokels
came roaring by, raising hell.

17
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,717
She had an aneurysm.
It just burst open like a ripe melon.

18
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,087
I'm a good doctor. I
did everything I could.

19
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,787
I cross-clamped
the aorta, but we...

20
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,426
...things would
be a lot different.

21
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,025
Yes, sir, you know they would.

22
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,335
First to go, them
pinhead town fathers.

23
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,869
Now Gus says he's gonna sue.

24
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,470
Doctor Fisher, my client
is certainly entitled to compensation...

25
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,172
for pain and suffering.

26
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,975
Pain and suffering, Gus?
The woman is dead.

27
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,548
Nothing but a bunch of old women.
Can't make their minds up about nothing.

28
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,286
If you want to sue someone,
why don't you sue the yokels in that van?

29
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,126
They're just expressing their
First Amendment rights to free speech.

30
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,256
I get it. You
represent them, too.

31
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,529
Tell them to express
it somewhere else.

32
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,464
Old fools.

33
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,869
"Smite with thine hand
and stamp with thy foot."

34
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,407
- Watch it!
- Look out!

35
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,114
Allburg used to be a quiet town.

36
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,852
Goddamned water-dunking
dunce-head!

37
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,286
Made me spill my wine!

38
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,826
- Matty, are you okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

39
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,990
Come on, let's drag you up.

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,497
Wait a minute.

41
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,096
It's dead, man.

42
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,035
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

43
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,630
I'm a soda-pop girl, myself.

44
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,620
I don't want you
girls quarreling, now.

45
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,381
Grandma, don't worry.
That's when we were young.

46
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,721
'Bye, Mom.

47
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,096
Hi, Mrs. Barrett. I
can't talk right now.

48
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,636
I want to get to town
before the stores close.

49
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,400
Don't let those girls
give you too much trouble.

50
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,633
They won't give me any trouble.

51
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,303
When you get back,
I'll put supper on, if you like.

52
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,675
For the drive home.

53
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,271
No, I'm going to
be back after dark.

54
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,182
- Don't you be late, now, Cindy.
- Okay, Mom.

55
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,076
Now coming on 6:30
here at our studios...

56
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,056
at Briggs hardware building
in downtown Allburg...

57
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,792
where it's been penny-saver day.

58
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,021
They're open late
tonight, till 8:00.

59
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,662
Don't miss out. I didn't.

60
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,298
And I see outside the window, the mercury
is down to a comfortable 86 degrees.

61
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,437
It's been a typical
north Maine summer.

62
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,067
We've still got June
bugs hanging on...

63
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,077
and some pretty fat mosquitoes...

64
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,080
That's quite a collection of stuff
you've got there, Mrs. Barrett.

65
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,350
What's the one with the
seven heads and 10 horns?

66
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,357
Actually, there's quite a story...

67
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,156
It's getting pretty late. We
should get going before it gets too dark.

68
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,527
Yes, you'd better. You know me.

69
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,458
I can just sit
here and go on and on.

70
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,231
But when you get back, I'll
tell you all about it, if you'd like.

71
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,796
I'd really like
that, Mrs. Barrett.

72
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,638
Don't get Grandma started on
that stuff. She'll never stop.

73
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,778
We should've grabbed one of those bottles.
She never would have noticed.

74
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,252
- Way to go.
- Can you blow the smoke outside?

75
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,189
She'll have a stroke
if she catches you smoking in here.

76
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,058
Don't worry about it.

77
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,462
- You got a flashlight in there?
- Flashlight, towels, candles...

78
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,228
cigarettes, salt, and mints.

79
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,163
Mints?

80
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,335
I'm not coming home
with liquor on my breath.

81
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,811
How's your new school
in River Junction?

82
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,618
Fifty miles south,
and the faces look the same.

83
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,750
At least they don't treat me
like Little Orphan Annie.

84
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,001
I'm 17. I'm going
away to college.

85
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,775
I'm not scared of
old empty buildings.

86
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,578
Come on. Let's go.

87
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,664
This place makes me
feel like a little kid.

88
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,723
All small and frightened.

89
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,399
You never came up here
when this place was hopping.

90
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,169
My mom used to come
up here all the time...

91
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,834
without my dad.

92
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,312
I think something was really
bothering her back then.

93
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,646
How's your mom doing?

94
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,042
She's all right, I guess.

95
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,345
My uncle, the priest,
has been hanging around.

96
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,121
It's weird.

97
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,419
I think I like this place
just the way it is.

98
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,421
Why are we doing this?

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,559
You know the rules: "Every kid..."

100
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,570
"Who leaves Allburg
has got to swim in the crypt.

101
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,369
"Otherwise you'll never wash
the dirt of this town off you."

102
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,801
That's right. If you
don't, you'll be back.

103
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,785
This place is dirty!

104
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,918
Stop complaining.

105
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,961
This is creepy.

106
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,225
You know there are
dead people in here?

107
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,166
What do you expect in a crypt?
Dead squirrels?

108
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,964
Here, give me the candles.

109
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,232
It's not so bad. It's warm.

110
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,074
Check this out!

111
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,697
God, he was only 15.

112
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,366
Guess he never made
it out of Allburg.

113
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,271
He was probably lucky.

114
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,277
He croaked a couple of years
before all that killing started.

115
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,973
Don't start with
that old story now.

116
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:19,277
The bodies are still down here,
buried underwater forever.

117
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,450
Come on, cut it out.
It's bad enough in here.

118
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,753
The night before my mom and
I moved to River Junction...

119
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,399
I came down here
with Paul Dugginer.

120
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,959
He's got seven of
them on his legs.

121
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,596
What were you doing
down here with Paul?

122
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,811
I can't believe you waited till your
last night to seduce my old boyfriend.

123
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,903
Thanks, pal.

124
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,181
Besides, you never did anything
with him anyway.

125
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,589
It wasn't the right time.
He wasn't the right guy.

126
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,923
- Have you ever met the right guy?
- No, I haven't.

127
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,864
It's no big deal, Luce.

128
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,263
It's not that great.

129
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,234
Shit.

130
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,682
- What's the matter?
- I lost my necklace.

131
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,493
Let me look.

132
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,950
Lucy, help me, please!

133
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,051
- There's somebody...
- Swim!

134
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,648
- Swim to the side!
- Oh, my God!

135
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,886
There's somebody down there!

136
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,631
Oh, my God!

137
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,805
Help me, please!

138
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,773
"When the new-risen sun
Looks through the misty air

139
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,406
"Shorn of his beams,
or, from behind the moon

00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:08,419

141
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,481

"condemned For ever now

147
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,600
So, who do you think
Uncle Milty's talking about?

148
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,145
The werewolf?

149
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,977
Satan?

150
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,947
Yes. Exactly.

151
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,721
And what is he saying...

152
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,419
about Satan?

153
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,753
That he's really mean and evil
and can really hurt people.

154
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,425
But he's a very proud person
who has been dumped on a lot.

155
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,298
But he's strong and can do
whatever he wants to do...

156
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,497
even if it means living in
Hell and hurting others.

157
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,666
Very perceptive. Excellent.

158
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,806
I think we can leave Uncle
Milty now and his lost paradise.

159
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,180
And won't that be a relief?

160
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,613
Mr. Gardner, where do they get these ideas
for the monsters in the books?

161
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,357
I guess they based them
on people of the time...

162
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,950
who did horrible, evil things.

163
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,894
People who tortured and murdered
for the pleasure of it.

164
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,363
Okay, Jesse.

165
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,831
Go get in the car.
I'll be right there.

166
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,300
Very good job, Jesse.

167
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm glad I came by early.

168
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,445
Now I know the garbage
you've been teaching my daughter.

169
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,244
Mrs. Blake, when you first
brought your daughter here...

170
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,478
you said she was very slow.

171
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,952
She's not slow.

172
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,923
She's a very smart girl with
an extremely short attention span.

173
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,893
Jesse loves ghost
and monster stories.

174
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,826
She's becoming an
excellent reader.

175
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,993
This type of reading is inappropriate
for a young Christian girl to study.

176
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,663
Mrs. Blake, she's reading!
What difference does it make what?

177
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,039
This is classic literature,
and she's reading.

178
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,635
This is blasphemous literature.

179
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,942
I'd rather Jessica be ignorant
than to have her reading...

180
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,713
about defiant, perverse,
godless souls.

181
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,856
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to frighten anyone.

182
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,861
- Are you okay?
- How do I look? Do I look okay?

183
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,708
You're the one
person I can trust.

184
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,671
I need your help.

185
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,847
Sure, you've always helped me
whenever you could. What is it?

186
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,610
I've fallen in love
with a woman.

187
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,683
And something horrible
is happening.

188
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,484
What the hell is...

189
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,665
Frank, when did you
start drinking?

190
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,298
Last week.

191
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,502
Couldn't even smell this
stuff without gagging.

192
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,842
Now it just barely
calms me down.

193
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,777
- Sure you don't want any?
- No, thanks.

194
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,709
I keep it handy.

195
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,784
Swiss. The best. I've got it set to the
Navy's laser clock in Bethesda, Maryland.

196
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,590
Accurate to a tenth of
a second every 10 years.

197
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,129
Frank, what the
hell is going on?

198
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,525
Remember when you
were in the seminary?

199
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,796
You came and said
you had fallen in love...

200
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,031
with the most
beautiful woman on Earth.

201
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:24,439
Yes, it's when I realized
that I wasn't cut out to be a priest.

202
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,301
I tried to talk you out
of leaving the seminary.

203
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,971
It was a good effort.

204
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,910
One of my few, yes.

205
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,378
You remember what I
confessed to you then?

206
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,944
I remember your affair.

207
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,354
Do you know whose
house this is?

208
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,784
This was my brother's house.
You were at his funeral.

209
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,956
I remember you there with
that girl, the new one.

210
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,699
Afterwards I consoled the loved ones.
I took care of things.

211
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,107
Then I started to come
by the house every day.

212
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,139
Help his widow, Karen.

213
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,543
Take her daughter Cindy to school
and just be there if Karen needed someone.

214
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,710
It sounds
compassionate, doesn't it?

215
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,682
That wasn't why I
was hanging around.

216
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,949
It wasn't humane or altruistic.

217
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,957
Do you know what it was, Mark?

218
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,825
I was in love... with
my dead brother's wife.

219
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,329
I was obsessed with her!
I had to be around her all the time!

220
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,633
- Frank, these things happen.
- You don't understand!

221
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,765
I never told you the worst part.
You have to understand.

222
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,073
The woman that I had that
affair with 10 years ago?

223
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,770
That was Karen Thompson,
my sister-in-law!

224
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,219
God damn me to Hell,
I slept with my brother's wife!

225
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,846
And not just once.
Time and time again!

226
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,390
What in God's name was that?

227
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,893
What is that up there?

228
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,399
I have committed
a terrible sin...

229
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,363
and now it is she
who is paying for it.

230
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,505
One minute and nine seconds.
Then, show-and-tell.

231
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,703
Will you please just tell me
what's going on?

232
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,308
That's when this day ends.
Sunset at 7:21 and 16 seconds exactly.

233
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,683
That's the beginning
of Karen and Cindy's day.

234
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,382
Karen and Cindy?
You mean they're in there?

235
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,779
Look.

236
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,927
Fifty-eight seconds
of daylight left.

237
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,312
Oh, my God, Frank.
There's a girl drowning in there!

238
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,705
No, she's not drowning.
It's how they live now.

239
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,615
When daylight comes,
they hide from the light.

240
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,518
Each seeks their own grave...

241
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,456
Cindy in the tub,
Karen in a cocoon-like coffin.

242
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,221
But when night falls, they feed.

243
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,530
They feed and torment.

244
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,198
Six seconds of daylight left.

245
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,926
Five, four, three, two, one.

246
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,127
Watch!

247
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,383
I know. I was like you...

248
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,415
wondering what
happened to reality.

249
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,919
- What happened to them?
- What does it look like?

250
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,727
Hiding from the daylight,
biting necks, drinking blood...

251
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,158
- They think they're vampires?
- Think?

252
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,097
Three days ago I came by
to check on things.

253
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,572
Karen had gone to Allburg to pick
up Cindy, who was visiting a friend.

254
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,439
It was the morning.
Good timing on my part.

255
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,945
Otherwise they
would have killed me.

256
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,311
Here. Listen to this.

257
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,380
What the fuck is this?

258
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,326
The phone number Karen left
when she went to pick up Cindy.

259
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,625
Cindy's friend is a
girl named Lucy Barrett.

260
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,461
- She lives with her grandmother, Hillary.
- I know Lucy.

261
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,091
This is her number.

262
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,836
I've called the house several times now.
It's always the same.

263
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,167
I don't know what
the hell is going on...

264
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,143
but those two girls have to go
to the hospital right now.

265
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,978
Your brain isn't accepting the facts!
They're vampires, Mark.

266
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,109
You can't take them
to the hospital...

267
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:12,122
cure it with penicillin or group therapy.
They'd have to destroy them.

268
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,351
I can't let that
happen to Karen.

269
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,287
She's been cursed for my sins.

270
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:21,162
Now the mother's sins have
been brought down on the daughter.

271
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,168
I went to the library.
I researched this.

272
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,669
"1568. Romanian priest.

273
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,799
"Known to have tortured and
murdered over 200, maybe more.

274
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,669
"Mostly young children.

275
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,376
"He was previously found in
a well, under 20 feet of water.

276
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,416
"When removed,
found to have a pulse.

277
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,748
"Accordingly, head was severed
from body and set on fire."

278
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,989
Come on, Frank.

279
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,725
It says they caught the guy.
They cut off his head.

280
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,229
Do you think there's just one?
Besides, he could have tricked them.

281
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,530
Vampires can change into
animals or wisps of smoke.

282
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,867
Or the townspeople lied.
They didn't want to start a panic.

283
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,497
I don't know what this
has to do with anything.

284
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,736
Those girls up there need help!

285
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,746
We can't take them to the
hospital, the police or anybody.

286
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,907
They'd kill them!
It's that simple.

287
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,577
The only way to help them is to
find the source of the vampirism.

288
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,254
I must stay here and take
care of Karen and Cindy.

289
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,553
I need your help, Mark.
I need you to go to Allburg.

290
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,388
Yes, go to Allburg.

291
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,362
Go to Grandma Barrett's house.
Find out what's going on.

292
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,332
Karen and Cindy were
at that house.

293
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,302
Whatever happened to them
may have happened to the Barretts.

294
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,065
You heard the phone.

295
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,270
I tutored Lucy Barrett.

296
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,509
Then help her. Please.

297
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,274
Go find out what's
going on. Please.

298
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,332
It had better be
important, young man!

299
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,135
Waking up an old gal
like me at this hour!

300
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,903
I'm very sorry.
My name's Mark Gardner.

301
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,003
- I'm a good friend of Frank Aldin's.
- Father Aldin.

302
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,480
Karen and Cindy's
friend. Of course.

303
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,310
Come on in, young man.
Let me get you something to eat.

304
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,552
Eat as much as you like.
I have plenty more.

305
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,727
A strong young man like you
needs to eat as much as he can.

306
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,758
You can understand how
concerned I am about this.

307
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,360
Of course.

308
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,964
It sounds like Karen and Cindy
need attention right away.

309
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,602
But if you ask me, those
girls just need a lot of good food.

310
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:57,746
When I feel a cold or
the flu coming on...

311
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,177
I just make myself a
big, juicy hamburger with...

312
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,153
all the fixings.

313
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,857
Would it be possible for
me to talk to Lucy?

314
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,861
Well, to tell the truth,
she's locked herself in her room.

315
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,659
She won't come out.
Not even for dinner.

316
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,431
- Why?
- I don't know why.

317
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,438
Maybe she's upset about something.
You know how teenage girls can be.

318
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,905
Do you think it's possible
that she knows that...

319
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,775
That what? That Karen
and Cindy are vampires?

320
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,871
Don't be silly, young man.

321
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,186
I'd really feel a lot better
if I could talk to her myself.

322
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,947
If you're going to be
insistent upon it, all right.

323
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,127
But I think that she's really
barricaded herself in pretty good.

324
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,324
What the...

325
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,078
Get off me!

326
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,655
Break the door! Kick it in!

327
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,685
I'm sorry. I killed
her. She's crazy.

328
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,856
She's not crazy,
she's a vampire!

329
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,434
You're a rough young
whippersnapper, aren't you?

330
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,767
Do you want to go
two out of three?

331
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,188
- You killed your grandmother!
- Yeah, I thought you killed her.

332
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,284
Besides, I thought
you were a teacher.

333
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,110
Right there. Want some more?

334
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,840
It's here, son.

335
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,950
Sir, I guess so.

336
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,848
Where are you from, soldier?

337
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,077
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sr.

338
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,320
Mother, stop it!

339
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,384
What the fuck is
going on up there?

340
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,053
What the fuck is going on?

341
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,766
Why don't you come up here
and find out for yourself?

342
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:32,828
Stop!

343
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,237
Leave her alone!

344
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,335
Shut up, Frank!

345
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,780
- Think we'll ever get home, sir?
- Don't worry, son.

346
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,944
I have some projects...

347
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,786
Come on, men. Put on your
radiation suits. We're going over.

348
00:29:56,227 --> 00:30:00,163
This has gotta be some
kind of joke. A gag.

349
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,168
Oh, God.

350
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,503
All right, stay
calm. Don't panic.

351
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,196
I'm sorry. I guess I didn't
realize how fast I was going.

352
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,031
License and registration.
Yours, too, young lady.

353
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:43,267
You were going at
least 30 miles an hour...

354
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,003
over the speed limit.

355
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,737
That's felony speeding.
What's the hurry?

356
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,646
It's just that I have
my girlfriend out really late.

357
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,914
Her father's very strict.
He's gonna be pretty pissed at me.

358
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,388
- Don't bullshit me, pal.
- No, sir.

359
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,251
Ma'am.

360
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,658
I have a runaway report on you
from a Hillary Barrett.

361
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,662
- My grandmother?
- You're gonna have to come with me.

362
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,034
- Where?
- Where do you think?

363
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,868
Back to Grandma's. Come on.

364
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,169
I mean, she's with me.

365
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,705
She can do whatever she wants...

366
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,879
I suggest you just keep driving
to River Junction under the speed limit...

367
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,280
and start dating
girls your own age.

368
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,017
'Cause if I ever catch you in my town
again, driving around late at night...

369
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,358
with a minor in your car,
I will haul your butt in.

370
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,493
It's not like that.

371
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,890
Come on. You're going
back to your grandma's...

372
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,664
so the poor old lady
can have her peace of mind back.

373
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,436
Yeah, they love Gran.

374
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:59,744
Please move your
vehicle along. Go home.

375
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,081
Go to bed.

376
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,123
Let's go!

377
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,328
I don't have all night.

378
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:22,540
This is the police department.

379
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,167
This is the police department.

380
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,676
We have another family massacre
out at Doug Inn.

381
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,836
All available units...

382
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,539
All these backwater people.

383
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:34,883
They're born, raised and eventually die
in the same square two miles...

384
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,979
of their dismal little hometowns.

385
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,647
And they love it.

386
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,182
In their minds, there isn't
anything worth doing or seeing...

387
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:47,425
or reading, that involves getting
off their big old white butts...

388
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,695
for longer than it takes to go
to the fridge and get a beer.

389
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,828
Unless it's blasting small
animals with a.30-06.

390
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,465
I have had it with
these country bumpkins!

391
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,609
They're intolerant and they
don't think for themselves!

392
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,169
They're like sheep!

393
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,011
Why don't you go back
to New York or wherever?

394
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,315
Because I fell in love and married
one of these cow-tipping dimwits!

395
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,753
He's been gone three weeks
on a hunting trip...

396
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,621
probably drunk on beer,
shooting at anything that moves!

397
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,557
Bastard!

398
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,498
So, how about you?

399
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,912
Why would you want to go and
scare your poor old grandma to death?

400
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,315
I've been having
some problems with her.

401
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,946
I think she's senile or something.

402
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,057
She thinks I'm trying to hurt her.
She gets really violent.

403
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,959
She even tried
to bite me once.

404
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,830
It sounds like she really
might need some help.

405
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,442
I'm gonna regret this.

406
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,924
It's all right. You don't
have to talk to her tonight.

407
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,831
She might be confused or upset
if you wake her up.

408
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,530
I'm sure she's up, worrying
and waiting up for you. Come on.

409
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,964
Let's go.

410
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,874
You really don't know her.

411
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,574
Strangers really bother her.

412
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,982
She gets very disoriented,
especially when she's asleep.

413
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,614
Oh, my! I've been so worried.

414
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,319
I was worried that something
horrible had happened to you.

415
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,519
Come in, dear.

416
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,029
She was just down on
Main Street, eating a pizza.

417
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,295
- She lost track of the time.
- A pizza. That's fine.

418
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,961
I was worried when
you missed dinner.

419
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,039
A young girl has got to
eat to stay healthy.

420
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,007
But never mind about that.

421
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,645
Come in, Lucy. I was just
about to have a late snack.

422
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,244
Officer, would you like
some late dinner?

423
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,047
Thanks, I'd love to, but I'm
on duty. I gotta make my rounds.

424
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,851
You can't leave me!
No, you don't understand!

425
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,788
She's a vampire!

426
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,089
Please don't leave me!
Look under her hat!

427
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,755
She has a golf club
stuck in her head!

428
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,029
Hey, what are you guys...

429
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,090
Come on.

430
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,866
It's party time!

431
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,942
Come on.

432
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,479
Damn it, Frank,
answer the phone.

433
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,912
What happened to the music?

434
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,147
Give me something
I can move to!

435
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,001
I think he's coming.

436
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,508
And he sounds mad!

437
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,835
Are you gonna
save me, Frankie?

438
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,473
- Shut up, damn you!
- What's the matter, Frank?

439
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:03,177
Are we bothering you?
Are we making too much noise?

440
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,946
Are we having too much fun?

441
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,389
Shut up. Damn you!

442
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,726
What's the matter, Father Aldin?
You can't hack the graveyard shift?

443
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,231
This isn't a convenience store!

444
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,839
- Please. I'm trying to help you.
- Help me?

445
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,338
By chaining me to the bed?

446
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,768
You know I can't let you go.
They'll destroy you.

447
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,675
But I'm hungry.

448
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,815
Cin doesn't look so good anymore...

449
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,285
and she's getting pretty sick
of eating leeches!

450
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,466
You're not dealing with any devils!

451
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,894
You're not Karen. You've
been inhabited by something else.

452
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,995
Another spirit is
using your body.

453
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,734
Oh, come on, Frank.

454
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,044
It's you who wants
to use my body.

455
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,907
Now open the door and
let's get on with it!

456
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,412
Stop it!

457
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,880
That indiscretion
has manifested itself...

458
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,151
into this putrid
corruption of the soul!

459
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,092
Feeling regretful, Frank?

460
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:27,265
I guess that's pretty standard
in your line of work.

461
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,907
I'll never apologize
for the way I am.

462
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,070
I like it.

463
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,079
If I want someone's
blood, I'll take it!

464
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,315
I'll suck it through my teeth
and let it coat my throat.

465
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,052
Thrill my stomach.

466
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,127
And I'm not ashamed
of what I am...

467
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,824
what I want,
and how I want it.

468
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,367
And I want you.

469
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,335
My soul...

470
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,170
my flesh craves you.

471
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,499
Did you see her yet?

472
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,403
She'll be getting ready for
bed about now. She's a fox.

473
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,680
I've seen all
the girls in town...

474
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,914
and this one's got the nicest,
roundest, firm pair of...

475
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,318
Who the hell are you?

476
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,688
- You wanna get a good look at her?
- Sure.

477
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,357
I know how to see into all the
houses around here. Come on.

478
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,427
It might be Mr. Bubble night.

479
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,460
"...lie down in green pastures:
He leads me beside still waters.

480
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,402
"He restores my soul:

481
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,206
"He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

482
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,870
- "Even though I walk through..."
- What are you doing that for?

483
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,175
"...fear no evil:
For thou art with me...

484
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,548
- "thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."
- It's just a waste of time.

485
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,315
"Thou preparest the table
before me in the presence..."

486
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,789
What has prayer ever
done for you, Frank?

487
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,531
What painful secret...

488
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,265
torments and compels you...

489
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,104
to kneel at my door?

490
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,077
"Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

491
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,620
- "I fear no evil: For thou art..."
- Listen to me.

492
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,054
"Thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me."

493
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,189
I love you.

494
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,566
Yes, it's true.

495
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,833
And you love me.

496
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:26,550
Check her living room window.

497
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,177
Check her living room window.

498
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,813
Sometimes when her grandma's gone,
she dances to music in her underwear.

499
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,069
What's that old
lady doing in there?

500
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,731
Get out of here.

501
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,402
Get lost. Beat it!

502
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,447
Get out of here!

503
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,691
Do it!

504
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,430
Goddamn it! You're a vampire!

505
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,250
- I guess we got her that time.
- Untie me!

506
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,601
I'm a teacher. I have a degree.
It's on my wall in River Junction.

507
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,967
- I'll show it to you.
- Look out!

508
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,581
All right. We'll find another road.
I mean, there's gotta be other roads.

509
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,921
How did he get here?

510
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,995
Go home! Get the
hell out of here, kid!

511
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,596
- Jeez, what happened?
- Nothing. Now just go home!

512
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,196
But they got the lady cop.

513
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,301
- I saw them dragging her into the lodge.
- Who?

514
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,006
I don't know. They looked
like some people from town.

515
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,480
Oh, my God! Officer Gates?
We have to help her!

516
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,519
- What are you, crazy?
- We just can't leave her there.

517
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,919
Why not? She left
you for vampire meat.

518
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,551
She didn't know what was
going on. She was nice to me.

519
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,391
Someone got the word out before
to stop us from leaving town.

520
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,161
Who says it won't happen again?
We need the police on our side.

521
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,564
All right. Get in.

522
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:07,303
But I'm telling you right now
I think this is a really bad idea.

523
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,019
- There, that's the place.
- They took her in the hunting lodge?

524
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,747
This isn't good.

525
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,053
Billy, do you know any way we
can get closer without being seen...

526
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,960
so we can see if
she's in there?

527
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,828
I only checked
out the ladies' room.

528
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,266
There's a great peek
through the air vent...

529
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,703
but there's a window, or skylight,
or something up there.

530
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,468
That ought to work.

531
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,387
What is it that you want?

532
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,656
What do you need most of all?

533
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:14,332
What is it that your
soul needs to live?

534
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:32,079
Oh, my God! It's Vampire
City down there.

535
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,358
Another fun-filled night in Allburg.

536
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,167
What the hell
is that all about?

537
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,470
The master's appetite
is considerable tonight.

538
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,281
But, of course,
this is comeback night.

539
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:06,211
He's looking forward
to seeing you again, Lucy.

540
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,187
You want to go inside and get
to know some of the locals?

541
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,492
I've seen them all naked.

542
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:35,076
Take me, Frank. Make me yours.

543
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,034
Please, God, forgive me.

544
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,877
You little bastard bloodsucker!

545
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,140
What are you, some kind
of vampire gofer boy?

546
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,650
I am the direct manifestation
of my master's desires.

547
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,645
I am known as a familiar...

548
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,313
one who can go amongst
the unknowing mortals...

549
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,051
without causing suspicion
or arousing alarm.

550
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,925
- What master? Who are you talking about?
- He whom I serve.

551
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,954
He who gives me ethereal life
and saves me from the animal curse.

552
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,600
He is Czakyr.

553
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,599
- Goddamn it, leave me alone!
- You'll rot in Hell for this, you little punk!

554
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,006
- They smell. They know.
- What?

555
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:51,844
That Lucy's been a good girl,
remained pure and unspoiled.

556
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,147
A virgin's blood
enlivens vampires.

557
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,684
The flavor is intoxicating
to a night-feeder.

558
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,584
It sends them
reeling in ecstasy.

559
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,358
You're a little shit,
you little pervert!

560
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,227
Yes, we do.

561
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:08,965
Let me go, you
sick old bastards!

562
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,525
Let me go, you
sick old bastards!

563
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,328
I'm a cop, for Christ's sake!

564
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,528
That hurts.

565
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,770
You are pissing me off big time.
And it is not a pretty sight.

566
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,243
Ask my husband.

567
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,149
Oh, my God.

568
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,299
Let go!

569
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:07,087
That's right. Come and
get it, you ugly bastards.

570
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:11,388
Mayor Horton, Gus
Willman, Doc Fisher?

571
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,088
Look at yourselves!

572
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,859
Oh, my God, I should've known...

573
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,833
you backwater assholes
would follow a dead priest...

574
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,530
slinking around at night,
drinking people's blood.

575
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,472
You have never had any
respect for the law.

576
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,045
Come on, froggy. Jump!

577
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,817
Lucy, come on! Let's go!

578
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,966
Master, the prize!
We lost the prize!

579
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,774
Over here! Master,
I've got them!

580
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,074
You keep going! I'll catch up!

581
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,575
Master, I have them.

582
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,856
I told you I'm not a vampire.

583
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,226
Son of a bitch.

584
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,933
Lucy, where are you?

585
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,930
There is good news, people!

586
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,027
Jesus is your friend.
If you have...

587
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,133
If you feel detested...

588
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,271
unwanted and unable to feel
the goodness all around you...

589
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,043
Jesus understands.

590
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,743
If your cup is empty...

591
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,979
he will fill it
to overflow it.

592
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,712
Enter his world...

593
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,721
Come on!

594
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,418
...with him and
he will love you.

595
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,461
Let's go. Come on, get in!

596
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,896
You're waiting for the old bat
boy to come back and bite you?

597
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:48,403
Hallelujah, dear friends.
Jesus Christ is your savior...

598
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,845
and his father is the
one and only true God.

599
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:55,783
He is awesome and
infinite, holy and just...

600
00:55:56,419 --> 00:56:00,116
Ioving and compassionate,
ruling the universe with truth...

601
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,084
and power.

602
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,456
I don't know who hates
this preaching more...

603
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,995
them skunking neck-biters
out there or me!

604
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,896
- Where the hell did you come from?
- Originally, Detroit.

605
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,400
My mom and dad moved there
during the Depression.

606
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,565
- Fled north from...
- Matty's a regular around Allburg.

607
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,405
Official town drunk,
to be more precise.

608
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,745
That's not half bad.

609
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,545
I used to think nothing could
beat a pint of Fleischmann's...

610
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,590
but I don't know. There's something
to be said for smoothness.

611
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,386
And you can't beat the price.

612
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:40,395
The shop owners around here
spend their days in a sack of water.

613
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,464
I'll get you out of
town before first light...

614
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:47,162
and then get myself back in
before noon for a good day's sleep.

615
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,638
- You're gonna come back here?
- Of course I'm coming back.

616
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,642
I grew up here. And besides,
I kind of like being...

617
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,077
the only upstanding
citizen in Allburg.

618
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:02,745
This leads up to the old
lumber mill. This is Mill Road.

619
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,013
- What's up there?
- Nobody, I hope.

620
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,488
- Won't they look for us up there?
- I don't know.

621
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:11,220
But I got to admit, since they been
hanging around the old bat boy...

622
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,693
they've gotten clever.

623
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,289
Maybe he's beaming his brainwaves
at them or something.

624
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:40,453
I don't think they
take a fancy to me.

625
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,261
Probably too old
and liquored up.

626
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,834
And besides, I am a bit
of a night person myself.

627
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,404
That's when I come alive.

628
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,902
My head is clear, and it
don't get too fogged up...

629
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,338
till near morning.

630
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,479
But the night's for me.

631
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:08,147
That's when I do my best
thinking, during the night.

632
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,952
And that's when them rascals
are out shopping for a meal.

633
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,022
I'm curious about something.

634
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,886
How did you come to save us
just at the perfect time?

635
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,429
That's all right.

636
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,935
If I was you or your boyfriend,
I wouldn't trust me, either.

637
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,528
Boyfriend?

638
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:31,040
I heard a racket
down by the lodge...

639
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:35,408
and I figured they had
finally gotten Officer Gates.

640
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,609
I always liked Gates.

641
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:42,742
She thought Allburg was a
town of thick-headed hillbillies.

642
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,349
I guess she didn't even notice
a change over these people.

643
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,119
I drove down here
to help her out.

644
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:56,155
Then I saw her patrol car
parked at the lodge.

645
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,667
I guess they got her.

646
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:09,376
Do you know anything about the
old church on Cherry Street?

647
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,803
What about it?

648
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,847
I went down there,
in the crypt.

649
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,917
I saw something
come out of the water.

650
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,651
It grabbed my friend Cindy...

651
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,225
and I thought it killed her.

652
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,057
But when I went home to get help,
she was there with her mother...

653
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,489
and my grandmother.

654
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,634
They weren't the same.

655
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:39,875
This ain't exactly my
favorite story to tell.

656
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:43,270
If you know something, we'd sure
appreciate it if you'd tell it.

657
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,839
I was a couple of years out of
school, and working at the mill...

658
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:51,280
when this Father Vlado fella
come in from Europe.

659
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:56,555
A grown man playing funny games
with the Sunday school kids.

660
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,857
And a priest at
that. Bad business.

661
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,559
No one wanted it talked about.

662
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,898
The local people decided they'd
take care of it themselves.

663
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,201
But Father Vlado thought
he'd beat them to it.

664
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,401
So he went down to the crypt
and killed himself...

665
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,774
and took some of
the kids with him.

666
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,436
An awful sight.

667
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,043
No one wanted to go near him.

668
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:25,213
They figured they'd flood the
crypt and leave the bodies.

669
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:30,057
And then nobody went near
that damn place again.

670
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:39,431
I was in charge of the water
chute at the mill, then.

671
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,765
And I was to see to the
flooding of the crypt.

672
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,532
It wasn't hard.

673
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,840
I just knocked a hole
in the lower part of the wall...

674
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,144
near a natural spring.

675
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:58,384
Had 40 or 50 gallons...

676
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,782
a minute, flowing.

677
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,188
I'll never forget
some of the things.

678
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,925
Like the pieces of rope...

679
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:15,468
knotted tight around the necks
of those poor little children.

680
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:19,663
And the way the steam rose
from their bodies...

681
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,705
when the water hit them.

682
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:26,137
It was not a particularly
easy day's work.

683
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,656
- Do you think that was an animal?
- Yeah, a big one with fangs.

684
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,392
Be careful.

685
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,819
It's over here.

686
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,368
That little sucker is
running pretty fast.

687
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,779
Where is it?

688
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,449
Check the windows.

689
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,367
There's nothing over here.

690
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,546
Where the hell did
the damn thing go?

691
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,547
Stick him! Quick!

692
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,536
Damn! You do that real well.

693
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,399
God, I'm getting good at this.

694
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,211
I should have known.

695
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,413
Lawyers. Always
the slipperiest.

696
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,181
Even when they're
the walking dead.

697
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,588
Are you okay?

698
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:55,928
- Let's get that thing out of here.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

699
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,826
Too much blood set
around here as it is.

700
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,800
I guess you're right.

701
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:05,068
You know, they said something
about being able to smell...

702
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,166
- Lucy.
- Smell Lucy?

703
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:08,871
Why her?

704
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,570
Apparently, she's been...

705
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,045
- a good girl.
- A virgin, all right?

706
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,820
Virgin or not, it's
all right with me.

707
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,120
I don't place too much
importance on such matters.

708
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,389
Unfortunately that thing does.
It's crazy for her blood.

709
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,129
I'm sorry.

710
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,503
I think we should all try
to get some sleep.

711
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,496
You go first. Matty
and I'll keep watch.

712
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:42,540
How long has it been
since you've had some sleep?

713
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,743
Go on, relax. Matty
and I'll keep watch.

714
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,393
Thanks.

715
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,809
Go to sleep.

716
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,510
How are we doing with
that illegal Regal?

717
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,415
She's a tough little
flower, ain't she?

718
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,185
And pretty, too.

719
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,494
She's not my girlfriend.

720
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,558
Well, young fella,
I'd get on the job if I were you.

721
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,263
Gus Willman never had a woman...

722
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,037
that was better-Iooking
than a dead toad.

723
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,212
And now, he's dead.
What do you think of that?

724
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,614
You can't find many good-Iooking women
around these parts, you know.

725
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,713
You know, Matty...

726
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,751
I was studying to be a priest.

727
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,621
Say what?

728
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,860
I always seemed to lose
the calling, though.

729
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,930
Only time I ever
heard singing of angels...

730
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,924
is when I gaze into
a face like that.

731
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,697
God bless you, young fella.

732
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,447
I'm sorry, Mother.

733
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,050
Is that you?

734
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,618
Is your mother okay?

735
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,811
Lucy, it's me.

736
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,249
Don't wake them up.

737
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,649
Are you all right?

738
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,853
This vampire thing's a snap.

739
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,521
All I have to do is lay in a tub of
water all day, and eat live leeches.

740
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,295
I'm sorry I asked.

741
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:04,772
I'm living in the shadows, Luce.
Everything is in a dull, gray fog.

742
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,099
Nothing is the same.
Nothing is real.

743
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,904
I can't smell things
the way I used to.

744
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,780
I can't feel or even see
things the way I used to.

745
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,112
I tried smoking a cigarette.

746
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,981
My lungs don't even inhale.

747
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,588
Nothing is fun anymore.
Everything's about eating.

748
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:30,863
Killing and eating. And this
eternal-life thing's a real joke.

749
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,600
How'd you like to live forever with
a bunch of boring, depressing people...

750
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,764
who might as well be dead?

751
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:43,300
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry
I left you in the crypt.

752
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,745
I just got so scared.
I didn't know what to do.

753
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:49,011
It's all right. You
couldn't have helped me then.

754
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,319
But you can help me now.

755
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,184
Yes, we'll all help.

756
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,725
Czakyr thirsts for you
more than for them.

757
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:02,787
We'll be drawing him and the others away
from here. Then your friends will be safe.

758
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,698
It won't do any good
bringing them along.

759
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,535
We're going kamikaze, Luce.

760
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,697
We either do this or we
wander the Earth forever...

761
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,470
searching for bugs
and night crawlers...

762
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,273
and little animals
to stuff our tummies.

763
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,782
I hate him for
what he did to me.

764
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,912
Don't you want to end this?

765
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,090
What do we have to do?

766
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,494
We go back to the church.
We free those children.

767
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:39,000
We destroy his hiding place
and we kill that asshole.

768
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:43,631
Then the people of Allburg will
have a chance to return to normal...

769
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,606
so to speak.

770
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:03,049
- Damn it! You let me fall asleep!
- I let you?

771
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,387
Shit, she's gone!
They must've got her!

772
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:10,159
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- Get a grip. She left on her own.

773
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,962
What are you talking about,
you dumb drunk? She's gone!

774
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,198
Can't you figure that out,
you dumb fucking wino?

775
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,408
If those fangers had gotten her...

776
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:25,305
we'd have wound up with two inches
of pointed diggers in our necks.

777
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,780
I'm sorry. I'm
just really scared.

778
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:35,490
It's all right, son.
I've been called a lot worse in my day.

779
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,958
What do you think happened to her?
Where could she go?

780
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:42,520
The church. Don't you remember
the story she told us...

781
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,131
about losing her best
friend in that crypt?

782
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,964
- She wouldn't go there alone.
- Where else would she go?

783
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:50,631
There's nowhere else to go,
and nothing left to do...

784
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:54,437
except to go and be a hero
and stick that sucker. Come on.

785
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,873
Matty and the townspeople
of 50 years ago...

786
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,779
only knew part of the story.

787
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,244
Father Vlado Czakyr
was no priest.

788
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,649
He escaped from Europe when
his kind were being killed off.

789
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,248
- He's a vampire.
- No shit.

790
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,587
And the children are not dead.

791
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,697
They were, and
are, still alive.

792
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,135
- So where are the children now?
- They're still here.

793
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:28,235
Trapped in Czakyr's water grave,
so he could feed off them...

794
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,810
like my mother
was feeding off me.

795
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,109
If he needs to,
he'll hide again.

796
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,616
This time he wants to
take you with him.

797
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:39,749
No, I don't want to be
down there with them.

798
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,222
Let's start fucking
up his plans.

799
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,861
Burn, baby. Burn.

800
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,043
Just wait till old fang-face
gets a load of this.

801
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,339
Let's go.

802
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,506
Come on. We gotta stay on our toes.
We're getting really close.

803
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:46,043
I'm right there with you, kid. I'm just
trying to loosen up for vampire combat.

804
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:49,750
- Keep an eye on the back for bogies.
- Bogies.

805
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:00,934
- Oh, no.
- What?

806
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,029
Don't those ugly things got
anything better to do at night?

807
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,597
Not really. We got
some on our tail?

808
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,007
Just a few. Step on it, Matty!

809
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,739
Watch out! Bogies to the
port side. 10 o'clock.

810
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,078
Let's give them a
taste of Sir Lancelot.

811
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,550
Eat wood, you bucktoothed
son of a bat.

812
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,923
I missed him.

813
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,855
Do you think...

814
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,365
Kill it!

815
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,775
For God's sake, a milkman!

816
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,716
This town is a
real embarrassment.

817
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,368
Fuse and arm the warheads!

818
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:19,777
Holy shit! There must be
half a dozen cars back there!

819
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,873
Fuse and arm the warheads!

820
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,051
I'm doing it!

821
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,464
Help me!

822
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:19,573
Pilot to bombardier! Target!

823
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,302
- Target approaching!
- Damn, we're too late!

824
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,175
Looks like they got
the same idea we did.

825
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,353
Help me!

826
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:47,893
Get out of here! Go!

827
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,900
- Hold them off as long as you can!
- Piece of cake!

828
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,739
Round them up! Move them out!

829
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:54,766
Howdy, dear friends. Jesus Christ
died on the cross for our sins.

830
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,200
Now, it's your turn.

831
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,349
He killed Cindy!

832
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,453
We're in deep shit!

833
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,441
Come on.

834
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,635
Get up! Get along there,
little bat boys!

835
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:37,867
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

836
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,114
I'll hit the vein!

837
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,557
And don't come back,
you stupid hyenas.

838
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,395
Ugly, flightless vultures!

839
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,072
What the hell!

840
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,385
Bingo!

841
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,532
Let her go!

842
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,330
You big, dumb...

843
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,371
ugly fuck!

844
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,210
Bingo!

845
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:12,824
- Beggars can't be choosers.
- Get off me, you bloody quack!

846
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,851
I think my drinking days...

847
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,126
have just come to
an abrupt conclusion.

848
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,595
Take it easy.

849
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,034
Look, it's the children.

850
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:47,275
They're free now.
They're finally free.

851
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,110
What a nightmare!

852
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:27,510
What's all that blood?
This isn't my operating room.

853
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,016
Nurse, bring me
a cigarette, stat!

854
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:43,095
Jesus H. Christ, Ed!
It's a catastrophe.

855
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,967
I got half the town lined up
over at my clinic.

856
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,498
Been pulling splinters out
of their chests all day long.

857
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,977
Everyone looks a
bit peaked, too.

858
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,014
Ain't been feeling
too well myself, either.

859
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,381
You know, it could be meningitis.

860
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:00,910
That's an epidemic, Ed.
What are you gonna do about it?

861
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,690
We got to talk
business here, man.

862
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,923
I see a lot of changes
for this old town.

863
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,558
We gotta start attracting
new blood to Allburg.

864
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,659
People with disposable income.

865
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,766
Allburg used to be a quiet town.
