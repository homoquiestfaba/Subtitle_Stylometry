1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,666
- [Voiceover] He's on the move,

2

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,928
everything's coming to a head now.

3

3
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:14,407
- [Voiceover] I've sent a team.

4

4
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:15,964
- A team?

5

5
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:19,431
You mean that fledgling
magician and her mangy crew?

6

6
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,953
Did you know they're calling
themselves the Redthorns?

7

7
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,535
(laughing)

8

8
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,592
- Just like old times.

9

9
00:00:30,842 --> 00:00:33,871
- The Darkspore wants to be whole,

10

10
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,708
and all the heroes put together,

11

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,849
the living and the dead ones,

12

12
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:42,157
couldn’t keep it apart now.

13

13
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,145
- I have faith in Marek.

14

14
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,483
- You had faith in Szorlok once too.

15

15
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,790
What makes her any different?

16

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,864
Even if you had the
final piece, what then?

17

17
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:55,371
You haven't got any
plan what to do with it.

18

18
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,720
- I'll give it to the
gods, they can protect it.

19

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,011
- The gods.

20

20
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,864
How long before they toss that trinket?

21

21
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:06,726
Find a way to destroy
it, or you got nothing.

22

22
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:11,726
Until then, you’re just buying time.

23

23
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,943
- I had a vision.

24

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,756
I saw Szorlok and his undead armies,

25

25
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:20,233
marching death across the
land, from East to West,

26

26
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:23,772
until the last living
cities ran into the sea.

27

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,344
I also saw a dwarf,

28

28
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:31,212
without a face, wearing an iron crown.

29

29
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:34,051
- What else did you see?

30

30
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:39,051
(foreboding music)

31

31
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,794
You know my mind.

32

32
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,555
I'm after that crown.

33

33
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:45,473
You help me get it, and I’ll help you find

34

34
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,553
the Hammer of Tek.

35

35
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,093
The one weapon that could
destroy the Darkspore,

36

36
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,970
once and for all.

37

37
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,149
- The Happer of Tek is
gone, no one knows where.

38

38
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,031
And no mortal can wield it.

39

39
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:01,477
- Well, with the Iron Crown
of the Dwarves, I could.

40

40
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:03,364
(scoffs)

41

41
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,527
- Szorlok has the Iron Crown.

42

42
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,447
- That he does.

43

43
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:11,487
- You'd trade anything for
that crown, wouldn't you?

44

44
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:16,053
But not to find the Hammer,
or fight against Szorlok.

45

45
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:20,634
Your plan is to unite the dwarves again

46

46
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,448
and rule as their king.

47

47
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:23,974
- You've had your chance.

48

48
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:27,227
Your team gave three
pieces to Szorlok already.

49

49
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,812
I'll do what pleases me, just as you have.

50

50
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:33,966
I've already taken steps.

51

51
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:38,127
- As have I.

52

52
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,720
(laughing)

53

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
- Cunning as a snake.

54

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
(foreboding music)

55

55
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,774
- Going into the woods.

56

56
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:26,976
- Caia-bekk, you're up.

57

57
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,099
Let's have a look.

58

58
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,099
(menacing music)

59

59
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,050
(crow caws)

60

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,050
(menacing music)

61

61
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:06,306
(heavy breathing)

62

62
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,944
- Water, you wench!

63

63
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,821
I'm so thirsty I could drink sand!

64

64
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:28,840
- Oh, I'm brewing a batch of my finest,

65

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,390
when it's ready you can have all you like.

66

66
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,448
- You dare to touch me!

67

67
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:35,785
My father is surely
sending heroes after me,

68

68
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:37,967
and he will have you flogged to death!

69

69
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,547
I can't wait to see you
bleed out in the square!

70

70
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,981
I'll spit on your corpse, you bastard.

71

71
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,947
- What a lovely creature you are.

72

72
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:48,507
Don't worry, soon enough,

73

73
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:51,345
I'll tame you just like my other girls.

74

74
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:55,524
- Don't you dare compare
me to those witless whores!

75

75
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,714
- Charming.

76

76
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:08,710
(enchanted music)

77

77
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:48,965
- If you want to live, drop your weapons

78

78
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,865
and get away from the wagon.

79

79
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:53,563
(men laughing)

80

80
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,142
- It's an ambush.

81

81
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:56,998
Keep her alive, kill the others.

82

82
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,363
- Grab her boys.

83

83
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:00,828
(laughing)

84

84
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:05,828
(zealous music)

85

85
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,570
- Ahh!

86

86
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,953
(zealous music)

87

87
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:24,037
- Bah, kill them all!

88

88
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,352
- Get her, get her!

89

89
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,281
- Ahh!

90

90
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:38,281
(zealous music)

91

91
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,378
- [Voiceover] Amateurs.

92

92
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,662
- Do you care to wager?

93

93
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,008
- 20 if they even get inside.

94

94
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,783
Another 20 if they get the shard.

95

95
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,704
- I'll take it.

96

96
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:03,704
(zealous music)

97

97
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,781
(grunts)

98

98
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,731
- That's the problem with
crossbows, gentlemen.

99

99
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,267
Slow reload time.

100

100
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:33,594
(screaming)

101

101
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:35,381
(grunts)

102

102
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:40,322
(zealous music)

103

103
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:53,234
(grunts)

104

104
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:54,536
- Driver, run her down.

105

105
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:57,460
(laughing)

106

106
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,460
(menacing music)

107

107
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:12,543
(laughs)

108

108
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,523
(laughs)

109

109
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:19,523
(menacing music)

110

110
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:30,140
(laughs)

111

111
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,628
(menacing music)

112

112
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,167
(laughs)

113

113
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,873
(screams)

114

114
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:40,873
(menacing music)

115

115
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:57,836
(zealous music)

116

116
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,017
(screams)

117

117
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,372
(laughs)

118

118
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,084
(grunts)

119

119
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:13,042
(menacing music)

120

120
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,509
- Oh fyke!

121

121
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,700
(gun fires)

122

122
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,274
- I'm gonna kill you, you bastard!

123

123
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,047
(grunts)

124

124
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,881
- Come on, Thane, keep up.

125

125
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:44,873
(menacing music)

126

126
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,336
No, no, hey this is your stop, eh.

127

127
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,530
Come on Thane, come on.

128

128
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,025
Come on boy.

129

129
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,067
(laughs)

130

130
00:09:57,067 --> 00:10:02,067
(thrilling music)

131

131
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:05,484
No!

132

132
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,685
(gun fires)

133

133
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,637
- Amateurs.

134

134
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,441
- You might as well pay up now.

135

135
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,501
They're going to blow it.

136

136
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:17,501
(thrilling music)

137

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,026
- Welcome back.

138

138
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,981
(laughs)

139

139
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,364
(loud explosion)

140

140
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:26,906
(grunts)

141

141
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:31,906
(zealous music)

142

142
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,656
- Keep up!

143

143
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:39,646
(grunts)

144

144
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:44,646
(thrilling music)

145

145
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,064
(labored breathing)

146

146
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,187
- What is it Thane?

147

147
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,215
- I have.

148

148
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,784
- Can you go help Marek up front?

149

149
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,063
You're no use to me back here.

150

150
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:55,697
- I have keys!

151

151
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,257
- Oh, why didn't you say so?

152

152
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,772
(grunts)

153

153
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,298
(screams)

154

154
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:08,603
- That's enough from you.

155

155
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,609
Stay down.

156

156
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:15,522
(menacing music)

157

157
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,780
(grunts)

158

158
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,768
- I'll take these, thank you.

159

159
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:38,768
(menacing music)

160

160
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:50,617
(laughs)

161

161
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:54,102
- Right.

162

162
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,411
- Move.

163

163
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,398
He's almost in.

164

164
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,015
- Still got it.

165

165
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:09,229
- They're inside, pay up.

166

166
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:20,629
- Oh yes, you, you do know how to travel.

167

167
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,468
- Yes.

168

168
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:25,428
Have a set.

169

169
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:26,698
- [Dagen] I shall.

170

170
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:27,807
- Something to drink?

171

171
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,258
- Please.

172

172
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,172
- Ah.

173

173
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:36,218
- Give me the Darkspore.

174

174
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:40,395
- When you're dying,
and you're bleeding out

175

175
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:42,827
wishing you'd done things differently,

176

176
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:44,534
I want you to remember this moment,

177

177
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:47,147
when I gave you one last
chance to walk away.

178

178
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:50,210
- Hold on, hold on.

179

179
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,378
We're not here to kill you,
we just want the Darkspore.

180

180
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,203
(grunts)

181

181
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:58,174
- Yes, we will kill you,

182

182
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,596
unless you give us what we want.

183

183
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,861
- Yeah, like the lady says.

184

184
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:13,591
(foreboding music)

185

185
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,339
(voices whispering)

186

186
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,503
- Hm, you've mistakenly robbed

187

187
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:23,405
The infamous Admiral Borlund Hess.

188

188
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:27,288
This is my wagon, my women, my Darkspore,

189

189
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:30,232
and you squandered your one
last opportunity to walk away.

190

190
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:32,472
- Yes, we know, you're smart, powerful,

191

191
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:35,470
we're going to regret it,

192

192
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,011
but this is our wagon now,

193

193
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,446
and it's time for you to leave.

194

194
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,907
- Okay.

195

195
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,510
I'm gonna give you a choice.

196

196
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,647
We can fight this to the death,

197

197
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,581
or we can stop the wagon,

198

198
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,187
and I can walk out with
my last shreds of dignity.

199

199
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,704
Either way, I'm not stepping off

200

200
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,886
my own fyking war wagon at full speed.

201

201
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:04,698
- I'm good with the second option.

202

202
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,739
- Thane!

203

203
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,635
- At least the weather's nice.

204

204
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,603
Good day for a walk.

205

205
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,172
- I shouldn't have touched it.

206

206
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:29,580
- Nonsense, you were brilliant
sweetheart, we got it.

207

207
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:53,873
(menacing music)

208

208
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,777
- [Thorsten] It's not over yet.

209

209
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:02,777
(menacing music)

210

210
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,030
(grunts)

211

211
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,783
(grunts)

212

212
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:32,707
- Your necromancer's touch
awakened the final piece.

213

213
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,841
I must thank you.

214

214
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,699
Without your aid, I may
never have found it.

215

215
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:42,020
To show you my gratitude,
I'll give you another chance.

216

216
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,863
Join me, and your friends may live.

217

217
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,529
(grunts)

218

218
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:53,529
(zealous music)

219

219
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:10,067
(grunts)

220

220
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,309
(growls)

221

221
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,792
You think you can defeat me?

222

222
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:24,792
Even with three pieces, I
command the denizens of the pit.

223

223
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:29,439
I call you forth from the grave,

224

224
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,439
assassins of old, Multu-gahnuken!

225

225
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:43,160
(hisses)

226

226
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,764
(growls)

227

227
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,955
(shrieks)

228

228
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,531
You once served the Lich King Vekru Nom,

229

229
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:59,885
and now you serve me.

230

230
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,037
The last piece.

231

231
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:06,240
I can sense its power.

232

232
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,421
(screams)

233

233
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,322
(heavy breathing)

234

234
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:15,776
Power over death.

235

235
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:19,103
Immortality is mine at last.

236

236
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,114
Bring me the Darkspore!

237

237
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:27,274
(elated music)

238

238
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:30,453
- Marek, take the Darkspore
where the Gods can protect it.

239

239
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:33,494
- She's not taking it anywhere.

240

240
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:36,812
All of you together are
still no match for me.

241

241
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:41,166
- Marek, I believe in you.

242

242
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,246
- No!

243

243
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:44,597
- Gojun, no!

244

244
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,689
(shrieks)

245

245
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,072
(sighs)

246

246
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,653
(hisses)

247

247
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:03,653
(menacing music)

248

248
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,583
(hisses)

249

249
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,594
(heavy breathing)

250

250
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:28,427
- Obey me.

251

251
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:32,384
I am Marek, a true born necromancer.

252

252
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:36,520
Szorlok is gone, you are mine to command.

253

253
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,867
- Marek.

254

254
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,703
You have no authority.

255

255
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:47,045
The Darkspore speaks, and
it does not call you master.

256

256
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:48,796
- Worth a try.

257

257
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,857
- Thanks very much.

258

258
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:52,798
(screams)

259

259
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,385
(grunts)

260

260
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:59,385
(menacing music)

261

261
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,399
(growls)

262

262
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,375
- This isn't going well.

263

263
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,924
- Do you have any ideas?

264

264
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,484
- Hold them off!

265

265
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,451
(yells)

266

266
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,158
- [Marek] We're leaving.

267

267
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:33,020
(thrilling music)

268

268
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,389
- Go Marek, go!

269

269
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:43,237
(zealous music)

270

270
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,930
- What were those things?

271

271
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,412
- I'd rather not know.

272

272
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,588
- And that's the other half.

273

273
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:55,408
You know, I like this team.

274

274
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,336
They're full of surprises.

275

275
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,750
- The wind is against us, Admiral.

276

276
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,088
- Patience, the wind is ever changing.

277

277
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:20,888
(foreboding music)

278

278
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:25,888
(zealous music)

279

279
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,544
- Well, aside from nightmarish demons,

280

280
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,083
from an entirely different dimension,

281

281
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,558
I'd say that went rather well.

282

282
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,069
Also, unless anyone can boast
a number higher than seven,

283

283
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:56,629
I do believe I'm the winner.

284

284
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:57,707
Marek, you owe me a kiss.

285

285
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:58,929
Thane, 40 silver will do just fine.

286

286
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,508
- You didn't kill seven.

287

287
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:03,912
I killed six, you killed
three, maybe four.

288

288
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:06,890
- You're serious?

289

289
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,389
Three on the side, three
on the back, that's six.

290

290
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,171
One off the roof makes seven.

291

291
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,889
40 silver please
- [Thane] He wasn't dead.

292

292
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,034
- His head hit the road full in the face.

293

293
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:16,294
- I saw him get up.

294

294
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:17,717
- Then he was twitching from death throes.

295

295
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:22,675
Marek, you owe me that
kiss, Thane, 40 silver.

296

296
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,161
- Thane's always been a man of his word.

297

297
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,273
- Are you calling me a liar?

298

298
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:29,451
- No, of course not.

299

299
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:31,287
But you are a very good thief.

300

300
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:34,072
Not what you would call an honest trade.

301

301
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:36,966
- Be that as it may, I will
pretend I didn't hear that.

302

302
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:40,662
- Marek, where are we going?

303

303
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,072
- Gojun said to take the Darkspore,

304

304
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:47,209
someplace where the
gods can watch over it.

305

305
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:50,969
- Uh-huh, so where are we going?

306

306
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,932
- Well he couldn't say, because

307

307
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:56,347
Szorlok was right there listening.

308

308
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:02,719
(screaming)

309

309
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:05,844
- Oh, hello.

310

310
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,734
I am so very sorry.

311

311
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,516
Our deepest apologies.

312

312
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:11,234
We've been very preoccupied.

313

313
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:12,515
- Bastard!

314

314
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:14,189
Some rescue!

315

315
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:18,109
When my father finds out
how ill-treated I've been.

316

316
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,197
Don't just sit there!

317

317
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:21,960
Untie me, you half-breed.

318

318
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,542
Disgusting, pointed devil ears.

319

319
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:30,209
You, peasant wench, go
get me something to drink

320

320
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,172
before my mouth turns to dust.

321

321
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:34,344
- Pardon me?

322

322
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:37,695
- Oh, fyke, get out of my
way, I'll do it myself.

323

323
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,653
What does that depraved ogres have

324

324
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,605
for a lady to drink around here?

325

325
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:50,320
- I think, that maybe we
got off on the wrong foot.

326

326
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,641
Let's start over, I'm Dagen, and you must.

327

327
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:58,061
- Don't you dare touch me,
you are lower than a dog.

328

328
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,484
- I could use a drink myself.

329

329
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:06,341
- Ha, that black crystal
really gave it a nasty kick.

330

330
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:09,113
- Black crystal, Dagen!

331

331
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,159
- You impudent peasant!

332

332
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,685
I will see to it that you.

333

333
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,584
- I didn't swallow, I didn't swallow,

334

334
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,418
I didn't swallow, I didn't swallow!

335

335
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:24,418
(foreboding music)

336

336
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,544
- [Dagen] What's happened to her?

337

337
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,625
(groans softly)

338

338
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,526
- She's brain-dead, like the others.

339

339
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:37,222
- Yes, well in her case,

340

340
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:40,075
it's quite an improvement, isn't it?

341

341
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:46,201
Uh, Marek, Marek, it's,
she's looking at me.

342

342
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:49,837
Marek?

343

343
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:50,767
No, no

344

344
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,398
(groans)

345

345
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,780
- It's the Darkspore, she's drawn to it.

346

346
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,525
She likes you.

347

347
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:01,319
- Of course, I mean females of all races,

348

348
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,123
and states of mind, are drawn to.

349

349
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,670
I mean she's not immune to all of this.

350

350
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,334
- It's adorable.

351

351
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:12,691
- What's taking so long?

352

352
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:14,845
Marek kill her too?

353

353
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:19,845
- Um, no, no, she's still alive.

354

354
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,354
Sort of, I think.

355

355
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:30,252
(groans)

356

356
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:32,287
- Sorry.

357

357
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,271
I'm not much of a healer.

358

358
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,697
Not like Teela.

359

359
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:40,056
- No one will ever be like Teela.

360

360
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:43,444
Even as you took her
life, she healed your leg.

361

361
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:49,088
- I'm here.

362

362
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,279
Thane, it's me.

363

363
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:55,621
- What was that?

364

364
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,269
- What was what?

365

365
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:00,946
- You.

366

366
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:04,265
Are you alright?

367

367
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:10,054
- [Teela's voice] Go South
to the Temple of the Owl.

368

368
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:13,216
You will find me there.

369

369
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,907
(gasps)

370

370
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:17,796
- How did you do that?

371

371
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:18,956
- What?

372

372
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:20,439
- It's not funny.

373

373
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,156
- What are you talking about?

374

374
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:24,674
- Go South, to the Temple o the Owl.

375

375
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:25,751
- What are you saying?

376

376
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:27,575
- You said it with Teela's voice.

377

377
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:29,862
- Thane, stop, you're scaring me.

378

378
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:34,792
- What exactly did you do to her?

379

379
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,944
- I channeled her life force.

380

380
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:41,458
It consumed here entirely.

381

381
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,137
- She's there.

382

382
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:49,337
Somehow she's inside of you.

383

383
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,814
She spoke to me.

384

384
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:56,182
- Thane, she's gone.

385

385
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:57,312
Don't do this to yourself.

386

386
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:59,106
- You did this to me!

387

387
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:02,263
You took her from me!

388

388
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,654
The Temple of the Owl, what is it?

389

389
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:05,906
- It's a place.

390

390
00:26:05,906 --> 00:26:07,645
- Tell me!

391

391
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:10,872
- I read about it once.

392

392
00:26:10,872 --> 00:26:13,541
A Temple of a Silver Owl.

393

393
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,538
In Gojun's library.

394

394
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:17,993
It's a holy site, a mythical place

395

395
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:22,724
between this world and
the Realm of the Gods.

396

396
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:26,266
A place where the gods can watch over it.

397

397
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,924
- Is it to the South?

398

398
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:29,865
- But it's just a myth,
it's not a real place.

399

399
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:31,929
- Is it to the South?!

400

400
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:36,070
- Beyond the White Waste, yes.

401

401
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,425
- That's where we're going.

402

402
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:40,588
- Thane, I,

403

403
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:41,708
I think that maybe.

404

404
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,521
- That's where Gojun
Pye meant for us to go.

405

405
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:46,327
Now Teela is guiding us there.

406

406
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:47,660
- Thane, I must have
just thought it out loud

407

407
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,784
- If there's a chance,

408

408
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:49,990
she's there.

409

409
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,053
That she's alive somehow.

410

410
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,553
There's nothing that will
keep me from reaching her.

411

411
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:00,144
Nothing.

412

412
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:05,144
(somber music)

413

413
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:19,972
- Gojun where are you?

414

414
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,972
(menacing music)

415

415
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:29,661
- What is this place?

416

416
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,335
- We are banished to a
dimension of shadow and ash.

417

417
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:37,039
Where nothing has ever lived.

418

418
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,207
Nothing for you to feed on.

419

419
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,765
- You fool!

420

420
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,762
What have you done?

421

421
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:52,143
- You have no power here, necromancer.

422

422
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:01,537
- So this is your plan?

423

423
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:04,012
How long do you think
you can keep me here?

424

424
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:06,295
- I was planning on forever.

425

425
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:08,609
Though I'm not sure time

426

426
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:12,033
has any meaning in this particular realm.

427

427
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:14,996
- Clever,

428

428
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:19,231
so, what now?

429

429
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,271
- Well I thought maybe
we could sit and chat.

430

430
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:24,533
Reminisce about days gone by.

431

431
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:26,987
- Or I could just kill you.

432

432
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:30,234
- That depends how good
your channeling magic is.

433

433
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:32,410
Do you even carry components?

434

434
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,494
- Gojun, how soon you forget.

435

435
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,772
I am a master of all magics!

436

436
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:44,772
(menacing music)

437

437
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:01,378
(engine roaring)

438

438
00:29:01,378 --> 00:29:04,935
- [Voiceover] Help me, please! Help!

439

439
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,822
I can't move.

440

440
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:19,026
I'm having trouble breathing.

441

441
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:24,963
- It's alright, it's alright.

442

442
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,361
I'm here to help you.

443

443
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,705
- Oh thank you.

444

444
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,519
I knew someone would come.

445

445
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,282
- Something's not right.

446

446
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,746
- [Woman] You're my only hope.

447

447
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:38,978
Please.

448

448
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,962
- [Marek] Degan, wait!

449

449
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:43,969
- Hey, it's alright.

450

450
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:45,712
It's alright.

451

451
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,360
(laughs)

452

452
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:52,525
- Thank you Degan.

453

453
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,392
You're truly my hero.

454

454
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,616
- I'm your hero.

455

455
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,629
- Degan!

456

456
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,564
(grunts)

457

457
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:09,212
- I'm her hero.

458

458
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:11,043
- You idiot!

459

459
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,439
Thane!

460

460
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,704
- Oh!

461

461
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:18,673
(laughing)

462

462
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:23,649
(thrilling music)

463

463
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:33,741
- Give us back the Darkspore,
and we'll let you live.

464

464
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:37,835
Never mind, I'd rather kill you.

465

465
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,892
(laughs)

466

466
00:30:39,892 --> 00:30:44,892
(thrilling music)

467

467
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:55,801
(heavy breathing)

468

468
00:30:55,801 --> 00:31:00,801
(thrilling music)

469

469
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:05,731
(laughs)

470

470
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,532
- [Dagen] Wait!

471

471
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,559
(heavy breathing)

472

472
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,247
(laughs)

473

473
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,211
(grunts)

474

474
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:19,211
(thrilling music)

475

475
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,307
(heavy breathing)

476

476
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:30,873
- Rezzik?

477

477
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:32,217
- You know him?

478

478
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:34,510
- No.

479

479
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,372
(thrilling music)

480

480
00:31:38,372 --> 00:31:40,091
(yells)

481

481
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:41,705
(grunts)

482

482
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:47,760
- Two blades are no match
for shield and sword.

483

483
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,372
(grunts)

484

484
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,987
(yells)

485

485
00:31:57,162 --> 00:31:58,809
(grunts)

486

486
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,935
(grunts)

487

487
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:11,348
- Shields are for cowards who
need something to hide behind.

488

488
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,881
- They're for men in retreat!

489

489
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:16,794
(grunts)

490

490
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,387
- To kill a tortoise, you must simply find

491

491
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:20,522
his soft spot.

492

492
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,481
(grunts)

493

493
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,744
- Hey, listen, listen.

494

494
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:25,046
Not to start pointing fingers,

495

495
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,763
but she really is entirely to blame.

496

496
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:28,023
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

497

497
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:30,060
She's not even my type,
she's all skin and bones.

498

498
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,287
- Shut up, thief!

499

499
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:32,601
- Oh!

500

500
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:36,143
Listen, listen, if this is about
that silver horn I borrowed

501

501
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:38,986
I was going to give it back.

502

502
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:40,482
(yells)

503

503
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:42,812
Not that!

504

504
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:46,675
Marek, switch!

505

505
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:50,563
- Your lover and I have
a powerful connection.

506

506
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,622
My charm has never worked so quickly.

507

507
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,611
- He's not my lover!

508

508
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:58,760
How's that for connection?

509

509
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,288
(yells)

510

510
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,856
- Marek!

511

511
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,450
(grunts)

512

512
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:08,524
That was a dirty, dirty
trick to play, love.

513

513
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,192
- Why do you want the Darkspore?

514

514
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:13,432
(grunts)

515

515
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,196
- Your team has failed enough.

516

516
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:18,777
- My team is sent by Gojun Pye.

517

517
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,558
We have to stop Szorlok.

518

518
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:22,852
- Hammerhead told me you'd say that.

519

519
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:24,090
- Hammerhead?

520

520
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,117
- How many times are you
going to give another piece

521

521
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:28,271
to Szorlok before you bow out?

522

522
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,298
Just walk away, we'll take it from here.

523

523
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:31,418
- Not unless you can tell me

524

524
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:33,914
why Hammerhead wants the Darkspore.

525

525
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,253
- And you'll walk away?

526

526
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:39,718
- If it's a good reason.

527

527
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,848
- All right.

528

528
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:44,242
I'll tell you what I know.

529

529
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:47,443
He was drunk, I overheard
him muttering to himself,

530

530
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,420
something about an Iron Crown.

531

531
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,361
- That's it?

532

532
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:53,609
It's not much to go on.

533

533
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:54,921
I need to know his real intensions.

534

534
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,247
(yells)

535

535
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,401
- Diplomacy's not my best attribute.

536

536
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,697
(yells)

537

537
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:03,705
- Men are fools.

538

538
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:05,092
- I'm only half man.

539

539
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,558
(grunts)

540

540
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,690
And half elf.

541

541
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,592
A thief, by trade, or
didn't Rezzik tell you?

542

542
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,075
Very sticky fingers.

543

543
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:15,920
I have the Darkspore, let's move!

544

544
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,781
- Rezzik!

545

545
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,505
- Horses!

546

546
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:25,179
(thrilling music)

547

547
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,291
(yells)

548

548
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,050
(grunts)

549

549
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,028
- Hurry up.

550

550
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,579
(grunts)

551

551
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:37,693
(grunts)

552

552
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,656
- [Thane] Why didn't you do that?

553

553
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:49,656
(thrilling music)

554

554
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:52,680
- See, all fixed.

555

555
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,981
No harm done.

556

556
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:55,378
- There would have been nothing to fix,

557

557
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:58,891
if you could only keep your
animal urges under control.

558

558
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,035
- [Dagen] Animal urges?

559

559
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:01,669
- [Marek] Never mind, drive.

560

560
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:06,669
(thrilling music)

561

561
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:10,557
- Managed to snag this, from her bosoms.

562

562
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:13,008
- Her bosom?

563

563
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,515
How did you manage?

564

564
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:15,743
- Well.
- [Marek] Never mind, I don't,

565

565
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:17,561
I don't want to know.

566

566
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,554
White Dragon eggshells.

567

567
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,113
This is worth a fortune!

568

568
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:25,399
- Like I said, no harm done.

569

569
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:29,422
(thrilling music)

570

570
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:30,824
(yells)

571

571
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:33,316
- You were saying?

572

572
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:34,436
- Uh.

573

573
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,857
- Anybody with range wanna get back here?

574

574
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:41,857
(thrilling music)

575

575
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:55,803
- Surrender! It's over!

576

576
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:58,208
(zaps)

577

577
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:03,208
(thrilling music)

578

578
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:06,089
- [Thane] Are you gonna
shoot back at them?

579

579
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,529
- I'm out of batwing resin!

580

580
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:08,543
- What?

581

581
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,325
- On my staff!

582

582
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:15,325
(thrilling music)

583

583
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,405
- [Rezzik] You're finished!

584

584
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:20,890
(grunts)

585

585
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,967
- Get up, get up!

586

586
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:26,371
(grunts)

587

587
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:29,407
(zaps)

588

588
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:34,297
(thrilling music)

589

589
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:37,550
(grunts)

590

590
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:45,606
- Is that all you've got?

591

591
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:48,160
- We're gonna spill your guts out!

592

592
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:52,343
(yells)

593

593
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,762
- Woo-hoo!

594

594
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:09,762
(thrilling music)

595

595
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:11,806
- Ugh!

596

596
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,404
- What now?

597

597
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:16,058
- We take the long way around.

598

598
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:18,160
This isn't nearly over.

599

599
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,160
(thrilling music)

600

600
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,998
- Why do we hve so many enemies?

601

601
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:39,041
- Dagen, tell us about the ax men.

602

602
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:42,930
- The ax men is Rezzik,
a notorious mercenary.

603

603
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:47,565
- He mentioned a woman?

604

604
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,534
- Yes he did.

605

605
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,593
Well, she's nobody.

606

606
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:52,958
I mean she's not nobody,

607

607
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,038
she's wealthy daughter of a nobleman.

608

608
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,322
High society, very well endowed.

609

609
00:37:57,322 --> 00:38:00,789
With gold, and nothing else.

610

610
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:02,827
Well you can't blame the girl
for taking a liking to me

611

611
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,065
over that barbarian.

612

612
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,879
He doesn't even bathe properly.

613

613
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,749
Sorry, she has good taste.

614

614
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:09,605
Ah, you're not blaming this on me?

615

615
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:12,732
- [Marek] No, of course not,
you self obsessed libertine.

616

616
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:14,152
They're after the Darkspore.

617

617
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:15,666
- Oh.

618

618
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,010
Ah!

619

619
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,706
- And that is for
falling all over yourself

620

620
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:22,386
to rescue that magician
- [Thane] Why do they want the Darkspore?

621

621
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:24,036
- They're working for Hammerhad.

622

622
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,426
- [Dagen] Well that's perfect.

623

623
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:26,479
It's all a big misunderstanding then.

624

624
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,674
- No.

625

625
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:30,555
Hammerhead hired them
because we keep failing.

626

626
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:31,708
- [Dagen] Well that's even more perfect.

627

627
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:32,988
We take the Darkspore to Hammerhead

628

628
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:34,428
and we get a big sack of god.

629

629
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:36,284
- You're not suggesting
we hand over the Darkspore

630

630
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:38,449
to that snake of an innkeeper for money?

631

631
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,303
- Go on.

632

632
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:40,465
- He's more likely to sell it to Szorlok

633

633
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,046
than to hide it from him.

634

634
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:44,233
- I think Hammerhead wants to trade

635

635
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:46,222
the Darkspore for the Iron Crown.

636

636
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,605
- The Iron Crown.

637

637
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,604
- The Iron Crown that would
make him king of the dwarves.

638

638
00:38:49,604 --> 00:38:50,927
- Well that's very lovely for Hammerhead,

639

639
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,591
but I don't see what it has
to do with the Darkspore.

640

640
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:54,468
- When the Golgotians
conquered and scattered

641

641
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:56,625
the dwarves centuries ago.
- [Dagen} Golgotians?

642

642
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,790
- They captured the Iron Crown.

643

643
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,548
- Golgotians are Szorlok's people.

644

644
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,065
- No, not his people, allies.

645

645
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:02,908
- Oh.

646

646
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,946
- But in any case,

647

647
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:06,591
Szorlok may have the Iron Crown.

648

648
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:08,872
- You think Szorlok want's
to be king of the dwarves?

649

649
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,730
- Dagen, let me finish.

650

650
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:12,976
There's a legendary hammer.

651

651
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,171
The Hammer of Tek.

652

652
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:16,070
- The Hammer that forged the world?

653

653
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,929
- Legend has it that the Hammer of Tek

654

654
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,148
cannot be held by any mortal hands,

655

655
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,537
except one who wears the Iron Crown.

656

656
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:24,775
- It's a wonderful children's story.

657

657
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:26,535
- Yes, well assuming that it's real,

658

658
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:27,889
Tek's Hammer could destroy anything.

659

659
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,052
Which includes the Darkspore,

660

660
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:31,409
so maybe Hammerhead wants
to get the Iron Crown

661

661
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,372
so that he can get the Hammer,

662

662
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,057
and destroy the Darkspore
for once and for all.

663

663
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:37,618
Which on all accounts,
is a very real plan.

664

664
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:38,962
No more running and hiding.

665

665
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,189
- You're talking about
handing over the last piece

666

666
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:41,458
of the Darkspore.

667

667
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,338
Now unless I'm mistaken, that
makes Szorlok the Lich King.

668

668
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,654
The whole world becomes undead.

669

669
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:50,399
- Yes, even if we did have the Iron Crown,

670

670
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,396
and found the Hammer of Tek.

671

671
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:54,519
Destroying the Darkspore
may be impossible.

672

672
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,501
Just because you have a sword,

673

673
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:56,781
doesn't mean you can slay a dragon.

674

674
00:39:56,781 --> 00:39:58,477
- Yes, but I still think we
should take it to Hammerhead,

675

675
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,439
and at least see what his intentions are.

676

676
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,998
- Gojun said to take the Darkspore

677

677
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,983
to where the gods can protect it.
- [Dagen] Look, Thane!

678

678
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,625
Gojun is not here right now!

679

679
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,102
- We're gonna go with Gojun's plan
- [Dagen] He's gone, he's probably dead.

680

680
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:09,432
- Teela will take us to the
temple. - [Dagen] Alright
I'm sorry Marek, but that's

681

681
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:10,776
how it is, I vote Hammerhead
- [Marek] Enough!

682

682
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,909
Listen to you two.

683

683
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,437
This is not a vote!

684

684
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:18,829
Right now, we gonna follow the road.

685

685
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,050
This road, the only road.

686

686
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,133
I need time to rest and think.

687

687
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:26,420
Don't eat that.

688

688
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,239
- It's the right thing to.

689

689
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,917
Did you say Teela will guide us?

690

690
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,269
You're not worshiping her now?

691

691
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,864
Wait, you're not, right?

692

692
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:51,279
(somber music)

693

693
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:58,549
- Not now Thane.

694

694
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:03,207
- We need to speak to her.

695

695
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:06,302
- She's dead.

696

696
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,856
- Somehow she's inside of you.

697

697
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:14,178
I have to believe.

698

698
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:18,884
- You'll believe anything
that might bring Teela back.

699

699
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:22,123
But you don't know how necromancy works.

700

700
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:27,137
I remember it, every detail.

701

701
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:32,139
I killed her,

702

702
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:36,732
I sucked every drop of her life force

703

703
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:40,916
and used it to destroy.

704

704
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:45,916
(somber music)

705

705
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:49,428
- We have to get her out of you.

706

706
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:53,476
For your sake, and for hers.

707

707
00:41:56,608 --> 00:41:59,328
- Get some sleep, Thane.

708

708
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:01,450
You need it.

709

709
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,421
(somber music)

710

710
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:17,828
(groaning)

711

711
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,630
- You and me both sweetheart.

712

712
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,844
We're not gonna let the
crazies get to us, right?

713

713
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:25,756
We're gonna keep it together.

714

714
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,879
Right?

715

715
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:32,486
Can you understand anything I'm saying?

716

716
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:36,193
Just raise your hand or
something if you can, yeah?

717

717
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,055
Okay.

718

718
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:49,566
Alright, look, one time Thane
told me Marek was upstairs.

719

719
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,604
I went there, it was
Hammerhead's room instead.

720

720
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:54,542
It was all very embarrassing,
he was not impressed.

721

721
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,552
(sighs)

722

722
00:42:58,019 --> 00:42:59,459
- Feels rather good.

723

723
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:02,158
You're an excellent listener.

724

724
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:04,389
Come on, come here.

725

725
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,109
That's alright, come on.

726

726
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:09,306
There you are.

727

727
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,954
Hey, no!

728

728
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:15,726
Absolutely not, none of that!

729

729
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:20,259
That's good, there you go, stay there.

730

730
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,546
- Thane.

731

731
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,520
Thane.

732

732
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,520
(hopeful music)

733

733
00:43:57,831 --> 00:43:59,132
- Teela.

734

734
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:02,406
- [Dagen] Thane, it's your turn.

735

735
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:06,571
Oh.

736

736
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,319
- What are you doing?

737

737
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:11,580
Get away from me!

738

738
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,547
- [Teela] Let me out!

739

739
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,840
- I'm not her.

740

740
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,840
(somber music)

741

741
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:30,008
- Dagen.

742

742
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:32,364
- You don't need to say anything.

743

743
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:34,572
Gods know I've been begging
for a kiss from you,

744

744
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,409
a little sign of affection, something,

745

745
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,767
and it was Thane all along.

746

746
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:41,551
It's fine, go back to him, have at it.

747

747
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:42,970
I won't get in the way.

748

748
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:43,951
- You're impossible.

749

749
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,476
- I'm impossible?

750

750
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:49,956
Do what you want, I'm done
with you, you crazy girl!

751

751
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:54,956
(somber music)

752

752
00:45:02,672 --> 00:45:04,632
We need to refuel.

753

753
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:07,257
- [Marek] We're almost to the White Waste.

754

754
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:11,353
The Temple of the Owl
is somewhere out there.

755

755
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:13,902
- Well, keep that.

756

756
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:15,219
- Dagen.

757

757
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:17,577
- You little lovebirds,

758

758
00:45:17,577 --> 00:45:20,202
feel free to wander this barren wasteland.

759

759
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:23,264
Me and Zombie Girl,
we're going back to town

760

760
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:25,237
for a couple of nice drinks.

761

761
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:27,933
- Dagen, it's not what you think.

762

762
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:32,961
- Your team is a failure, Marek.

763

763
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:35,890
- He needs to know.

764

764
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,603
- Know what?

765

765
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,583
- Teela is inside of her.

766

766
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,947
They're sharing the same body

767

767
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:44,024
- No, it's my body.

768

768
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:47,523
Somehow Teela controls me sometimes.

769

769
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:52,523
- Thane, this is weird,
and sick, and twisted,

770

770
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:54,468
and wrong, and Marek,

771

771
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:57,725
quite frankly I'm surprised
you're playing along with it.

772

772
00:45:57,725 --> 00:45:58,820
- Stop holding her back.

773

773
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,865
- Listen, Thane, just shut up about it.

774

774
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:04,545
- [Thane] Teela, it's me, Thane.
- [Marek] What are you doing, stop!

775

775
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:05,996
- [Teela] Marek.

776

776
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,340
(screams)

777

777
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,946
- [Dagen] Hey! Stop it, leave her alone!
- [Thane] Teela listen to me, we need you.

778

778
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:11,245
Follow my voice.

779

779
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:13,575
Teela, come!

780

780
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:18,245
- [Teela's voice] Time is running out.

781

781
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:21,447
Make haste, to the Temple.

782

782
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,930
They're coming.

783

783
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,588
Run for your lives.

784

784
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:32,585
Run, run.

785

785
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:35,028
- What have you done to her?

786

786
00:46:35,028 --> 00:46:36,329
- It's Teela.

787

787
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,705
Her spirit is inside of her.

788

788
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:38,921
Run, why?

789

789
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,042
Why run?

790

790
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:43,467
- [Teela's voice] Death.

791

791
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,978
- I liked it better when she said run.

792

792
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:51,329
(hissing)

793

793
00:46:56,018 --> 00:46:58,535
- Thane, now that you figured
out how to talk to Teela,

794

794
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:00,394
you think we could get Marek back?

795

795
00:47:00,394 --> 00:47:05,316
(menacing music)

796

796
00:47:06,928 --> 00:47:09,808
- Hang on!

797

797
00:47:10,718 --> 00:47:12,521
- What is it?

798

798
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:17,148
- Faster Thane!

799

799
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,866
Thane!

800

800
00:47:20,866 --> 00:47:25,866
(menacing music)

801

801
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:32,667
- [Marek] Thane!

802

802
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:37,667
(menacing music)

803

803
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:47,210
- Thane, they're coming, use the bottles!

804

804
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:52,200
(menacing music)

805

805
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,962
(grunts)

806

806
00:47:55,962 --> 00:48:00,962
(menacing music)

807

807
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:04,914
- Are they gone?

808

808
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:09,680
(shrieks)

809

809
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:13,151
(screams)

810

810
00:48:22,176 --> 00:48:24,170
Hang on!

811

811
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:29,124
(menacing music)

812

812
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:41,754
(hissing)

813

813
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:46,754
(thrilling music)

814

814
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:01,014
(hisses)

815

815
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:06,014
(thrilling music)

816

816
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:41,440
(laughs)

817

817
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,471
(yells)

818

818
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:46,219
- Thane!

819

819
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:49,167
Turn around, we lost Dagen!

820

820
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,666
(grunts)

821

821
00:49:57,964 --> 00:50:00,048
(growls)

822

822
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:07,354
- You are brilliant!

823

823
00:50:07,354 --> 00:50:09,295
Come on!

824

824
00:50:09,295 --> 00:50:14,220
(thrilling music)

825

825
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:18,291
Come on, come on that's it!

826

826
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:20,596
That's it, perfect, take my hand!

827

827
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:23,636
My hand, come one!

828

828
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:25,834
Thane, slow down!

829

829
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:28,032
Take my!

830

830
00:50:30,172 --> 00:50:31,669
Thane!

831

831
00:50:31,669 --> 00:50:32,928
Thane, stop!

832

832
00:50:32,928 --> 00:50:34,645
We have to turn back!

833

833
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:37,070
- No Thane, keep going!

834

834
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,945
- Thane, you stop this thing!

835

835
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:41,318
Stop!

836

836
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:44,951
- There's nothing we can do.

837

837
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:49,951
(somber music)

838

838
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:57,161
- Stop.

839

839
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:02,940
- Accept your fate Szorlok,

840

840
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,235
we are both here forever.

841

841
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:08,751
(grunts)

842

842
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:19,276
Well, components are running low,

843

843
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,854
and channeling is depleted.

844

844
00:51:23,342 --> 00:51:26,428
- Yes, soon there will
be no magical reserves

845

845
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:28,346
for you to draw upon,

846

846
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:31,601
and then you will die.

847

847
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:35,484
- Whether I live or die doesn't matter.

848

848
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:39,580
You and the Darkspore will
be stuck here forever.

849

849
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,567
- It's strange to me you seem so certain.

850

850
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:46,963
You cannot really be that stupid, can you?

851

851
00:51:46,963 --> 00:51:50,068
- Keep talking Szorlok,

852

852
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,212
every moment that goes by,

853

853
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:55,210
Marek is further from your grasp.

854

854
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,792
- I need not grasp anything.

855

855
00:51:57,792 --> 00:52:01,175
She will come to me.

856

856
00:52:01,175 --> 00:52:04,761
Just as her mother did.

857

857
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:06,841
- She's stronger than her mother.

858

858
00:52:06,841 --> 00:52:09,888
(grunts)

859

859
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:13,745
- Oh yes, I am counting on it.

860

860
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:18,745
(menacing music)

861

861
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,734
- Dust storm away to the West.

862

862
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:41,331
It should just miss us.

863

863
00:52:42,884 --> 00:52:44,975
- How far to the Temple?

864

864
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:48,916
- I don't know.

865

865
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,463
- Could go on forever.

866

866
00:52:52,463 --> 00:52:55,264
We'll never find it, not
before we run out of fuel,

867

867
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:57,121
water, or both.

868

868
00:52:57,121 --> 00:52:58,347
- Teela said she would take us there

869

869
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:00,945
- Don't say her name.

870

870
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:08,622
I'm sorry we couldn't go back.

871

871
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:11,379
It was too late to save her.

872

872
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:14,888
(horse neighs)

873

873
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:17,650
- Wait.

874

874
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,563
(horse neighs)

875

875
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,039
- Dagen's friends are back.

876

876
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:35,191
- I've never fully tested my range.

877

877
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:41,222
(zaps)

878

878
00:53:41,222 --> 00:53:42,955
(grunts)

879

879
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:50,028
(zaps)

880

880
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:53,804
- Don't waste it, wait for a good shot.

881

881
00:53:53,804 --> 00:53:55,536
(grunts)

882

882
00:53:56,438 --> 00:53:58,406
- Never mind, fire away.

883

883
00:53:58,406 --> 00:53:59,851
(grunts)

884

884
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:04,434
(grunts)

885

885
00:54:04,434 --> 00:54:07,174
- Is everything under control up there.

886

886
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:08,544
(grunts)

887

887
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:12,178
- Don't listen to me, do whatever works.

888

888
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:15,035
- You're too big of a
target, go get Dagen.

889

889
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:16,657
- Good idea.

890

890
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:18,732
Don't lose my shield.

891

891
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:27,426
(yells)

892

892
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,426
- How we doing?

893

893
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:36,048
- I just missed you, that's all.

894

894
00:54:36,048 --> 00:54:37,072
- Ah.

895

895
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:39,082
(yells)

896

896
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:45,794
- Caia, now!

897

897
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:47,164
(yells)

898

898
00:54:49,516 --> 00:54:52,269
- She has blackvine, very expensive.

899

899
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:54,971
- See, that's what I've always said.

900

900
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,193
We need more gold!

901

901
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,681
- [Caia] Faster you fools!

902

902
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:01,713
- Come on.

903

903
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,483
- Is that good or bad?

904

904
00:55:07,483 --> 00:55:12,483
(menacing music)

905

905
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:14,489
- Based on past experience,

906

906
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:16,174
I'd say it's always bad.

907

907
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:17,849
Hey!

908

908
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:21,057
- I'm not falling for that old trick.

909

909
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,575
(laughs)

910

910
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:31,088
- Kill, kill, kill!

911

911
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:33,127
No survivors, boys!

912

912
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:38,123
(menacing music)

913

913
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,883
Go!

914

914
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:48,791
(laughs)

915

915
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:51,037
- It's her, it's the bloody Admiral.

916

916
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:52,785
(laughs)

917

917
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:57,785
(menacing music)

918

918
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:02,722
(yells)

919

919
00:56:02,722 --> 00:56:07,722
(menacing music)

920

920
00:56:17,058 --> 00:56:19,182
- [Dagen] Yes!

921

921
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:23,812
(screams)

922

922
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,920
- Oh brilliant!

923

923
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,722
- Oh, fyke.

924

924
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,692
Step aside, time to die.

925

925
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:36,692
(menacing music)

926

926
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:40,662
- Gotcha.

927

927
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:54,576
Sweet mother of vengeance.

928

928
00:57:00,407 --> 00:57:03,476
- Admiral, Admiral.

929

929
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:10,244
- Fyke, boys!

930

930
00:57:22,644 --> 00:57:27,583
(menacing music)

931

931
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:32,436
- Tell me, if you're so convinced
we are stuck here to die,

932

932
00:57:32,436 --> 00:57:35,316
then why is it you care
if your pitiful team

933

933
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:37,385
reaches their goal?

934

934
00:57:37,385 --> 00:57:40,777
I am defeated, nothing else matters,

935

935
00:57:40,777 --> 00:57:43,476
wouldn't you say?

936

936
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:45,845
- Even one piece of the Darkspore

937

937
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:49,420
has enough evil in it
to be worth protecting.

938

938
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,528
- No, no that's not it.

939

939
00:57:54,368 --> 00:57:56,600
You know how this ends,

940

940
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,227
and yet you still chose this path.

941

941
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,525
Tell me, why?

942

942
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:05,952
- Even if I told you,

943

943
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:09,770
you could never understand my way.

944

944
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:13,563
That is why you will fail in the end.

945

945
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:19,810
- No, I can see now that I merely

946

946
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:23,610
overestimated your intellect.

947

947
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,383
Your plan is ill conceived.

948

948
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:30,205
Which you will soon discover.

949

949
00:58:30,205 --> 00:58:34,317
- Then go on, what are you waiting for?

950

950
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:42,128
(sobbing)

951

951
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:52,024
- Marek.

952

952
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:57,086
You still, you still owe me a kiss.

953

953
00:58:58,496 --> 00:58:59,936
(coughs)

954

954
00:59:02,136 --> 00:59:04,612
- Shh, hey don't say that.

955

955
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:10,163
You're not dying.

956

956
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:18,114
(somber music)

957

957
00:59:24,678 --> 00:59:25,713
- [Thane] Marek.

958

958
00:59:25,713 --> 00:59:27,926
- No.

959

959
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,145
Dagen.

960

960
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:34,665
(sobbing)

961

961
00:59:34,665 --> 00:59:36,897
Dagen.

962

962
00:59:36,897 --> 00:59:38,817
Degan!

963

963
00:59:38,817 --> 00:59:40,630
Stop!

964

964
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,497
Dagen!

965

965
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:47,497
(sobbing)

966

966
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,235
Teela!

967

967
00:59:54,235 --> 00:59:56,557
Teela, help him!

968

968
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:59,338
Teela, heal him!

969

969
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:02,698
- Oh Marek, she can't bring him back.

970

970
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:07,698
(sobbing)

971

971
01:00:09,183 --> 01:00:11,103
- Teela help him,

972

972
01:00:11,103 --> 01:00:13,440
or I'll hurt Thane!

973

973
01:00:15,187 --> 01:00:17,880
Don't make me do it!

974

974
01:00:21,395 --> 01:00:22,873
Dagen.

975

975
01:00:24,276 --> 01:00:26,436
(gasps)

976

976
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:38,813
- What happened?

977

977
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:41,567
- She made Teela bring you back.

978

978
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:44,506
It may have been too much for her.

979

979
01:00:47,371 --> 01:00:51,344
- I was dead, I was dead.

980

980
01:00:53,088 --> 01:00:55,629
- We have to get Marek to that temple.

981

981
01:00:55,629 --> 01:00:58,989
She can't go on with Teela inside of her.

982

982
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:02,802
It's going to kill her, or me.

983

983
01:01:05,614 --> 01:01:08,835
- Marek, It's me, it's me, yes.
- [Marek] Dagen.

984

984
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:14,150
- You managed to keep
me around a bit longer.

985

985
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,223
- Don't explain.

986

986
01:01:19,223 --> 01:01:21,729
- Explain what?

987

987
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:26,658
- She's willing to sacrifice
anything to bring you back.

988

988
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:29,382
That's all.

989

989
01:01:34,265 --> 01:01:37,306
(horse neighs)

990

990
01:01:37,306 --> 01:01:39,552
It's probably just the wind.

991

991
01:01:39,552 --> 01:01:41,792
- You don't think those demons could

992

992
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:44,011
run through that storm do you?

993

993
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:48,240
- They don't seem to stop
at much of anything else.

994

994
01:01:50,632 --> 01:01:53,325
- Mind if we join you?

995

995
01:02:02,464 --> 01:02:05,616
The artifact, let's have it.

996

996
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:25,027
(ominous music)

997

997
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:34,790
- So that's what brings people
back from the dead, huh?

998

998
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,287
Is that how you got your thief back?

999

999
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,795
- It doesn't raise the dead to the living,

1000

1000
01:02:39,795 --> 01:02:42,196
it turns them undead.

1001

1001
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:46,862
- Oh, well that sounds bad.

1002

1002
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:48,839
You know, that reminds
me of that one time.

1003

1003
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,323
- How do you use it?

1004

1004
01:02:50,323 --> 01:02:53,684
- You don't, it uses you.

1005

1005
01:02:53,684 --> 01:02:56,030
It's a piece of the Lich Kings heart,

1006

1006
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:59,241
and it's power can only
be used by a necromancer.

1007

1007
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:00,905
Like me.

1008

1008
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:03,426
- Hammerhead's no necromancer.

1009

1009
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,261
- He'll trade it to a necromancer,

1010

1010
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:08,151
for the Iron Crown of the Dwarves.

1011

1011
01:03:09,021 --> 01:03:12,063
- I've known Hammerhead a
long time, he's no fool.

1012

1012
01:03:12,063 --> 01:03:14,017
- He's no fool,

1013

1013
01:03:15,787 --> 01:03:18,331
but he may not believe there's
any way to stop Szorlok,

1014

1014
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:21,212
so he'll profit any way he can.

1015

1015
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:25,032
- Yes, that is his way.

1016

1016
01:03:25,032 --> 01:03:27,026
- Know this.

1017

1017
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:31,144
The Darkspore is a
weapon with one purpose.

1018

1018
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:32,786
Death.

1019

1019
01:03:32,786 --> 01:03:35,390
If Szorlok gets that last piece,

1020

1020
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,226
nothing will matter.

1021

1021
01:03:37,226 --> 01:03:40,917
Not your gold, not
Hammerhead's crown, nothing.

1022

1022
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,541
(laughs)

1023

1023
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:45,077
What's so funny?

1024

1024
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:48,831
- Your dedication to Gojun's crusade.

1025

1025
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:51,713
- We can't let Szorlok get the Darkspore.

1026

1026
01:03:51,713 --> 01:03:53,548
We're all responsible for it.

1027

1027
01:03:53,548 --> 01:03:55,692
- That's your quest, not ours.

1028

1028
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:58,252
- We're mercenaries, true enough,

1029

1029
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:00,908
but we never take work
we don't believe in.

1030

1030
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:03,650
Hammerhead's ways may not
be in line with yours,

1031

1031
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,233
but what would you do that's any better?

1032

1032
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:08,558
- We're taking it to a
temple to keep it safe.

1033

1033
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:11,929
Anything's better than
letting Szorlok have it.

1034

1034
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:15,534
- I'm done talking, it's settled.

1035

1035
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:17,369
- You're making a mistake.

1036

1036
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:18,969
- Our only mistake is letting you live.

1037

1037
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:20,537
If I had it my way, you'd all be dead

1038

1038
01:04:20,537 --> 01:04:23,276
with a lot less discussion about it!

1039

1039
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:28,082
- We'll drop your weapons at a safe place,

1040

1040
01:04:28,082 --> 01:04:29,991
but don't bother coming after us.

1041

1041
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,266
We ride much faster than
this contraption ever could.

1042

1042
01:04:42,442 --> 01:04:45,077
You have too much doubt in yourself.

1043

1043
01:04:45,077 --> 01:04:47,702
Make your own path.

1044

1044
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:51,169
If you do wrong, at least
you made a real choice.

1045

1045
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:55,933
Don't go wrong following someone else.

1046

1046
01:04:59,684 --> 01:05:01,668
- Don't cry Redthorns.

1047

1047
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:04,451
You're lucky to be alive.

1048

1048
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:09,451
(ominous music)

1049

1049
01:05:15,546 --> 01:05:17,754
(shreiks)

1050

1050
01:05:17,754 --> 01:05:19,013
(yells)

1051

1051
01:05:19,013 --> 01:05:20,794
- We have to help them.

1052

1052
01:05:20,794 --> 01:05:21,712
- What?

1053

1053
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:24,229
- Come on.

1054

1054
01:05:24,229 --> 01:05:26,465
- Can't we just watch for a minute?

1055

1055
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:29,176
(menacing music)

1056

1056
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:31,506
(yells)

1057

1057
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:33,858
(hisses)

1058

1058
01:05:33,858 --> 01:05:38,858
(menacing music)

1059

1059
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:05,675
- Marek.

1060

1060
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:10,675
(menacing music)

1061

1061
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:16,439
- Go on you fools.

1062

1062
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:20,398
You owe us nothing, get
away while you still can!

1063

1063
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:23,152
We can't win, not without
Thorsten and Caia!

1064

1064
01:06:23,152 --> 01:06:25,233
(grunts)

1065

1065
01:06:31,563 --> 01:06:36,563
(thrilling music)

1066

1066
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:43,784
- Dagen, switch!

1067

1067
01:06:43,784 --> 01:06:45,063
- I will not switch!

1068

1068
01:06:45,063 --> 01:06:46,651
I was dead, I have earned the right

1069

1069
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:49,244
to fight the thing that only has one arm!

1070

1070
01:06:49,244 --> 01:06:51,207
(hissing)

1071

1071
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,223
Thane, Thane, switch!

1072

1072
01:06:53,223 --> 01:06:58,223
(thrilling music)

1073

1073
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:26,735
(ominous music)

1074

1074
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,019
(grunts)

1075

1075
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:43,019
(thrilling music)

1076

1076
01:07:51,186 --> 01:07:54,099
- [Marek] Are we really going to do this?

1077

1077
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:56,170
- What's the plan?

1078

1078
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,739
- I'm going to take the Darkspore

1079

1079
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:01,036
to the Temple of the Owl,
and you can either help me,

1080

1080
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:03,969
or you can die trying to stop me.

1081

1081
01:08:06,493 --> 01:08:09,030
- That was some quick thinking,

1082

1082
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,773
but your team needs a leader,

1083

1083
01:08:13,773 --> 01:08:16,738
and you keep waiting for
somebody to give you the answers.

1084

1084
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:20,162
Hammerhead, Gojun, they
won't lead your team.

1085

1085
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,653
Their time has past.

1086

1086
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:29,484
- Thank you.

1087

1087
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:31,638
- Ha, don't thank me.

1088

1088
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:34,936
We may all yet live to be enemies again.

1089

1089
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:36,625
Let's go.

1090

1090
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:45,582
- There's our guide!

1091

1091
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:48,046
I knew she wouldn't let us down.

1092

1092
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:53,046
(enchanted music)

1093

1093
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,916
(grunts)

1094

1094
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:15,797
(heavy breathing)

1095

1095
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:18,811
(grunts)

1096

1096
01:09:21,627 --> 01:09:24,239
- There's nothing left to channel.

1097

1097
01:09:26,603 --> 01:09:29,680
Looks like we're down
to brute strength now.

1098

1098
01:09:32,823 --> 01:09:36,365
- You always had me
out-matched physically,

1099

1099
01:09:36,365 --> 01:09:41,195
but I never had too much
trouble outsmarting you.

1100

1100
01:09:41,195 --> 01:09:43,290
(grunts)

1101

1101
01:09:47,202 --> 01:09:50,019
- You always were a cheater.

1102

1102
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:55,019
- There are no cheaters, only
the victors and the dead.

1103

1103
01:09:59,813 --> 01:10:04,813
(enchanted music)

1104

1104
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:11,671
- You all right?

1105

1105
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:14,963
- He was right, you know.

1106

1106
01:10:14,963 --> 01:10:16,702
- About what?

1107

1107
01:10:16,702 --> 01:10:18,505
- I'm not a leader.

1108

1108
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,404
- Really?

1109

1109
01:10:20,404 --> 01:10:23,037
Why do I keep following you then?

1110

1110
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:26,930
Why does Thane keep following you?

1111

1111
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:28,679
- I don't know.

1112

1112
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:32,446
Maybe because you like pain and suffering?

1113

1113
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:34,134
- Don't jest.

1114

1114
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:36,472
Not like this.

1115

1115
01:10:36,472 --> 01:10:40,593
We follow you for the same
reason Gojun Pye does.

1116

1116
01:10:40,593 --> 01:10:42,140
- What?

1117

1117
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:46,312
- Heck, Gojun doesn't
see you as a follower.

1118

1118
01:10:46,312 --> 01:10:50,046
He's looking to you for answers.

1119

1119
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:52,808
He believes that you can
succeed where he can't.

1120

1120
01:10:52,808 --> 01:10:56,030
- Don't be stupid, Gojun is
more powerful than I ever.

1121

1121
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,289
- Do you really believe it's still

1122

1122
01:10:57,289 --> 01:10:59,817
about being more powerful?

1123

1123
01:10:59,817 --> 01:11:03,455
It's never been that way
with us, it never will be.

1124

1124
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:06,350
That's not how we're
going to defeat Szorlok.

1125

1125
01:11:07,294 --> 01:11:09,382
- Then how?

1126

1126
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:12,246
What do we do?

1127

1127
01:11:14,452 --> 01:11:16,734
- Don't honestly know.

1128

1128
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,044
But I do believe, that
when the time comes,

1129

1129
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,136
you'll have the answer.

1130

1130
01:11:25,688 --> 01:11:29,989
You always do, that's why we follow you.

1131

1131
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:32,619
'Cause we believe in you.

1132

1132
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:37,699
- How are you so hopeful
all of the sudden?

1133

1133
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,911
- Well I died,

1134

1134
01:11:42,911 --> 01:11:45,665
and I was brought back to life

1135

1135
01:11:45,665 --> 01:11:48,031
by a beautiful girl
possessed by a goddess,

1136

1136
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:53,031
so the worst has to be behind me, right?

1137

1137
01:11:53,324 --> 01:11:58,324
(enchanted music)

1138

1138
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:10,073
(menacing music)

1139

1139
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,853
- Impossible.

1140

1140
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:15,915
What's the world coming to
when you can't kill a man

1141

1141
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,717
and be sure he'll stay dead?

1142

1142
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:20,609
- He's a reprobate, he's got no shame.

1143

1143
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:24,048
A downright disingenuous.

1144

1144
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:30,451
- Watch 'em.

1145

1145
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:48,254
(gasps)

1146

1146
01:12:48,254 --> 01:12:51,435
- [Teela's voice] This is holy ground.

1147

1147
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:54,286
Leave the wagon here.

1148

1148
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,846
(gasps)

1149

1149
01:12:56,846 --> 01:12:59,587
- [Dagen] Thane, stop the wagon.

1150

1150
01:12:59,587 --> 01:13:03,091
This is it, we're here.

1151

1151
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:11,184
(grunts)

1152

1152
01:13:16,714 --> 01:13:21,567
(enchanted music)

1153

1153
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:26,564
(menacing music)

1154

1154
01:13:28,587 --> 01:13:30,597
(grunts)

1155

1155
01:13:34,508 --> 01:13:37,356
- That's it, fight me
with all your strength.

1156

1156
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:39,031
(yells)

1157

1157
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:44,031
(menacing music)

1158

1158
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:49,842
Good, now, let me show you
the error of your ways,

1159

1159
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:54,842
as I return to our world and
usher in a new age or order,

1160

1160
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:58,383
my order.

1161

1161
01:13:58,383 --> 01:14:02,278
- There's no magic, you can't go back.

1162

1162
01:14:02,278 --> 01:14:07,278
- Yes, because, how did yo put it?

1163

1163
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:11,298
There is no living
thing for me to feed on.

1164

1164
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:15,598
Well there is one living thing.

1165

1165
01:14:15,598 --> 01:14:20,598
(menacing music)

1166

1166
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:24,263
You're too tired, old friend.

1167

1167
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:27,348
You've already used the
last of your strength.

1168

1168
01:14:27,348 --> 01:14:32,348
Now, give me your life
force, you cannot resist.

1169

1169
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:37,647
(menacing music)

1170

1170
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:46,373
(enchanted music)

1171

1171
01:14:56,349 --> 01:14:59,591
- No, it can't be gone.

1172

1172
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:01,152
No!

1173

1173
01:15:01,152 --> 01:15:04,140
- The closer we get, the weaker I become.

1174

1174
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,230
- If it gets much worse,
we are turning back.

1175

1175
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,813
I don't care if you think.
- [Thane] There!

1176

1176
01:15:08,813 --> 01:15:13,813
(enchanted music)

1177

1177
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:22,339
We're coming, Teela!

1178

1178
01:15:29,589 --> 01:15:32,043
- Admiral.

1179

1179
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:33,045
- What?

1180

1180
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:34,466
- They've disappeared.

1181

1181
01:15:34,466 --> 01:15:36,331
They're gone.

1182

1182
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,505
- What are you talking about,

1183

1183
01:15:37,505 --> 01:15:38,892
what are you talking about!?!

1184

1184
01:15:38,892 --> 01:15:41,025
I told you to keep an eye on them,

1185

1185
01:15:41,025 --> 01:15:42,945
and you can't find them from up here?!

1186

1186
01:15:42,945 --> 01:15:44,449
I'll throw you overboard,

1187

1187
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:47,302
and you'll find them from down there!

1188

1188
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,437
- I know they were somewhere,

1189

1189
01:15:54,437 --> 01:15:57,140
somewhere around here.

1190

1190
01:16:01,063 --> 01:16:03,900
- There, there it is!

1191

1191
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,706
Teela, we're here.

1192

1192
01:16:05,706 --> 01:16:10,706
(enchanting music)

1193

1193
01:16:16,674 --> 01:16:18,829
Friend or foe?

1194

1194
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:21,718
- Le's ask him.

1195

1195
01:16:21,718 --> 01:16:24,058
Hey, you there!

1196

1196
01:16:25,442 --> 01:16:28,204
We're friends with Teela.

1197

1197
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:30,802
You know, Teela?

1198

1198
01:16:31,832 --> 01:16:33,357
See how friendly he is?

1199

1199
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:34,477
Any ideas?

1200

1200
01:16:34,477 --> 01:16:35,576
- Don't show fear.

1201

1201
01:16:35,576 --> 01:16:38,291
- You should have said that first.

1202

1202
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:39,949
(yells)

1203

1203
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:47,670
(menacing music)

1204

1204
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:48,992
- Kill, kill, kill.

1205

1205
01:16:48,992 --> 01:16:50,944
(laughs)

1206

1206
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:55,944
(menacing music)

1207

1207
01:16:56,995 --> 01:16:58,803
(laughs)

1208

1208
01:17:01,411 --> 01:17:03,246
(laughs)

1209

1209
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:05,166
Ah, yes!

1210

1210
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:10,100
(menacing music)

1211

1211
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,439
- I'll get him sir.

1212

1212
01:17:24,999 --> 01:17:26,914
(yells)

1213

1213
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,764
(screams)

1214

1214
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:32,651
(screams)

1215

1215
01:17:32,651 --> 01:17:33,927
(yells)

1216

1216
01:17:33,927 --> 01:17:38,927
(menacing music)

1217

1217
01:17:43,016 --> 01:17:44,691
- Get me closer,

1218

1218
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:48,458
I want them to see my face,
as they die by my hand.

1219

1219
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,218
- Yes.

1220

1220
01:17:50,218 --> 01:17:54,976
(thrilling music)

1221

1221
01:17:54,976 --> 01:17:57,109
(grunts)

1222

1222
01:17:57,109 --> 01:18:01,970
(thrilling music)

1223

1223
01:18:45,374 --> 01:18:46,722
- Marek?

1224

1224
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,620
Marek, can you fight?

1225

1225
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,879
Markek?

1226

1226
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,832
Thane, tell your lady
we need our wizard back

1227

1227
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:56,480
or this is going to be over very quickly.
- [Thane] Need a little help.

1228

1228
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,520
- Whoever you are, you need to help us,

1229

1229
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,038
or we are going to die!

1230

1230
01:19:01,038 --> 01:19:03,120
(screams)

1231

1231
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,833
- You!

1232

1232
01:19:07,772 --> 01:19:10,543
(Teela whispering)

1233

1233
01:19:10,543 --> 01:19:12,167
(yells)

1234

1234
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:15,276
(screams)

1235

1235
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:23,134
(laughs)

1236

1236
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:25,492
- That's right, look up,

1237

1237
01:19:25,492 --> 01:19:29,218
and see the end of your
insignificant little lives.

1238

1238
01:19:29,218 --> 01:19:33,457
(menacing music)

1239

1239
01:19:33,457 --> 01:19:37,651
- Either way, you lose.

1240

1240
01:19:42,395 --> 01:19:43,855
(grunts)

1241

1241
01:19:43,855 --> 01:19:48,855
(somber music)

1242

1242
01:20:05,712 --> 01:20:08,427
- Yes, all mine.

1243

1243
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:16,473
I feast on the soul of
the mighty Gojun Pye.

1244

1244
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:21,034
The sweet succulence of victory.

1245

1245
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:23,157
(yells)

1246

1246
01:20:25,037 --> 01:20:26,461
(grunts)

1247

1247
01:20:33,945 --> 01:20:35,870
- Gojun.

1248

1248
01:20:37,328 --> 01:20:41,195
- You served your purpose, old friend.

1249

1249
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,624
- No!

1250

1250
01:20:47,624 --> 01:20:52,624
(somber music)

1251

1251
01:20:58,445 --> 01:21:00,665
- Bloody warlock, again!

1252

1252
01:21:00,665 --> 01:21:03,070
- He left me no choice.

1253

1253
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,780
In his last moments,

1254

1254
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,378
I looked into his mind.

1255

1255
01:21:10,378 --> 01:21:13,359
You, were his final thought.

1256

1256
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:18,229
- If I have my way, I'll
be your dying thought too.

1257

1257
01:21:21,687 --> 01:21:24,201
(crackling)

1258

1258
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:32,553
- You murder for pleasure.

1259

1259
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:35,599
- Only to fulfill my rightful purpose.

1260

1260
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:39,077
- Fyke him, he's pissin'
all over my party.

1261

1261
01:21:39,077 --> 01:21:40,982
Make it a double.

1262

1262
01:21:40,982 --> 01:21:44,045
- I'll take back what is mine.

1263

1263
01:21:44,045 --> 01:21:46,263
Stolen from me by betrayal,

1264

1264
01:21:46,263 --> 01:21:50,460
and finally returned to
its rightful possessor.

1265

1265
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:54,695
Yes, come to me.

1266

1266
01:21:59,031 --> 01:22:01,673
(laughs)

1267

1267
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,287
- Fyke!

1268

1268
01:22:14,561 --> 01:22:16,336
- Run!

1269

1269
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:20,386
- You cannot hide from me, Marek!

1270

1270
01:22:20,386 --> 01:22:22,860
There is no escape!

1271

1271
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:27,860
(thrilling music)

1272

1272
01:22:39,299 --> 01:22:41,817
(grunts)

1273

1273
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:46,817
(enchanting music)

1274

1274
01:22:55,639 --> 01:23:00,639
(heavy breathing)

1275

1275
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:12,692
(enchanting music)

1276

1276
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:24,414
(grunts)

1277

1277
01:23:24,414 --> 01:23:29,414
(enchanting music)

1278

1278
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:33,975
(breathing heavily)

1279

1279
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:38,975
(enchanting music)

1280

1280
01:24:10,454 --> 01:24:12,518
(gasp)

1281

1281
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:18,703
- Teela?

1282

1282
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:21,653
- Touch me not.

1283

1283
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:23,340
- Teela?

1284

1284
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:26,860
- Teela is with me.

1285

1285
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,134
We are the goddess Ana-Sett,

1286

1286
01:24:29,134 --> 01:24:34,134
reborn to dwell in the
world among mortals.

1287

1287
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:40,122
- What about the Darkspore?

1288

1288
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:42,021
How will you help us?

1289

1289
01:24:42,021 --> 01:24:44,372
You lead us here, for what?

1290

1290
01:24:45,242 --> 01:24:48,711
- You may impart the Darkspore to me.

1291

1291
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:50,290
- But can you keep it safe?

1292

1292
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,592
- [Ana-Sett] Not here.

1293

1293
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:54,569
I will fly from the
temple, away from Szorlok.

1294

1294
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:58,109
- Szorlok, he'll break through.

1295

1295
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:06,898
More running and hiding.

1296

1296
01:25:06,898 --> 01:25:09,404
- It's what Gojun Pye wanted us to do.

1297

1297
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:12,073
It's why we're here.

1298

1298
01:25:17,023 --> 01:25:18,996
- It doesn't feel right.

1299

1299
01:25:18,996 --> 01:25:21,162
It's what we've always done.

1300

1300
01:25:21,162 --> 01:25:23,723
- We have no other choice.

1301

1301
01:25:23,723 --> 01:25:28,683
- Unless, Ana-Sett, where
is the Hammer of Tek?

1302

1302
01:25:28,683 --> 01:25:30,824
Is it real?

1303

1303
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:34,589
- The Hammer is real, but it is lost.

1304

1304
01:25:34,589 --> 01:25:36,883
- You wouldn't give
Szorlok the last piece,

1305

1305
01:25:36,883 --> 01:25:39,944
not for a faint hope on some magic hammer.

1306

1306
01:25:39,944 --> 01:25:42,483
Gojun Pye wanted you to
give it to the goddess.

1307

1307
01:25:42,483 --> 01:25:45,929
- We'll never beat Szorlok
unless we stop running.

1308

1308
01:25:45,929 --> 01:25:47,988
Gojun is gone.

1309

1309
01:25:47,988 --> 01:25:51,001
I can't follow his lead anymore.

1310

1310
01:26:03,312 --> 01:26:08,312
- So, you would entrust
the Darkspore to Ana-Sett.

1311

1311
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:11,247
She cannot hide forever.

1312

1312
01:26:11,247 --> 01:26:14,170
I will hunt her down.

1313

1313
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:17,746
I will make her suffer
as any goddess should.

1314

1314
01:26:17,746 --> 01:26:21,415
- I didn't come here to
listen to more hollow mockery.

1315

1315
01:26:22,935 --> 01:26:25,843
I'm here to make an offer.

1316

1316
01:26:25,843 --> 01:26:28,970
You have the Iron Crown?

1317

1317
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:32,032
Yes, I know of Hammerhead's treachery,

1318

1318
01:26:32,032 --> 01:26:35,834
but are you bold enough to
make the same trade, with me?

1319

1319
01:26:44,056 --> 01:26:46,607
- You cannot fool me Marek.

1320

1320
01:26:46,607 --> 01:26:49,819
You seek the Hammer of Tek,

1321

1321
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:53,360
and you would wish to destroy
the greatest magic of all time

1322

1322
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,582
and forsake your destiny as a necromancer.

1323

1323
01:26:56,582 --> 01:26:58,160
- Call it what you will,

1324

1324
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,911
but I'm letting you
choose your own downfall.

1325

1325
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:06,911
Give me the crown, and you
can have the Darkspore now,

1326

1326
01:27:07,368 --> 01:27:10,749
or you can chase Ana-Sett
the world over for it,

1327

1327
01:27:10,749 --> 01:27:13,042
and keep the Crown.

1328

1328
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:16,621
Who knows, maybe you'd make
a good Kind of the Dwarves?

1329

1329
01:27:18,249 --> 01:27:21,587
- It's fitting you would
bring me this piece.

1330

1330
01:27:21,587 --> 01:27:24,713
Your mother once brought
me that same shard.

1331

1331
01:27:24,713 --> 01:27:26,367
- You lie!

1332

1332
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:28,961
- You know what's true.

1333

1333
01:27:28,961 --> 01:27:32,923
The Darkspore flows
through your very veins.

1334

1334
01:27:32,923 --> 01:27:35,462
She clutched the Darkspore to here chest

1335

1335
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:37,800
as you grew in her belly.

1336

1336
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,696
Month, after month, you drew
in the Darkspore's power.

1337

1337
01:27:42,696 --> 01:27:45,043
Swam in its shadow.

1338

1338
01:27:45,043 --> 01:27:47,817
- Make your choice.

1339

1339
01:27:47,817 --> 01:27:52,817
(ominous music)

1340

1340
01:28:06,638 --> 01:28:09,032
- At last.

1341

1341
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,662
(grunts)

1342

1342
01:28:17,434 --> 01:28:22,381
(heart beating)

1343

1343
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:27,381
(ominous music)

1344

1344
01:28:32,175 --> 01:28:36,250
- I am death!

1345

1345
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:40,015
I am the Lich King reborn!

1346

1346
01:28:40,015 --> 01:28:44,053
Witness the birth of a god!

1347

1347
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:48,379
You foolish child.

1348

1348
01:28:48,379 --> 01:28:53,245
You have sealed the fate of
everything that draws breath,

1349

1349
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:58,245
so begins the Age of Death.

1350

1350
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:04,878
(thunder claps)

1351

1351
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:16,165
- Doesn't look too bad so
far, this Age of Death.

1352

1352
01:29:21,635 --> 01:29:26,635
- [Ana-Sett] You have made
an unexpected choice, Marek.

1353

1353
01:29:27,053 --> 01:29:29,389
The Lich King will not delay.

1354

1354
01:29:29,389 --> 01:29:30,714
His aremies will rise from

1355

1355
01:29:30,714 --> 01:29:32,986
the graves of ancient battlefields.

1356

1356
01:29:32,986 --> 01:29:35,706
They will march on the
lands of the living.

1357

1357
01:29:35,706 --> 01:29:38,236
If you seek the Hammer,
you must make haste.

1358

1358
01:29:38,236 --> 01:29:40,685
- We will, where do we start?

1359

1359
01:29:40,685 --> 01:29:43,587
I only know the Hammer was
used by Tek, god of the forge.

1360

1360
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:46,126
- When Tek battled the
Lich King Vekru Nom,

1361

1361
01:29:46,126 --> 01:29:49,594
he was stuck down at the
hill known as Battlegrave.

1362

1362
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:53,755
Tek fell to his death, swallowed
deep in the Underworld.

1363

1363
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,390
The realm of the dead.

1364

1364
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,890
He took the Hammer
there, and cannot return.

1365

1365
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:02,934
- There's a first time for everything.

1366

1366
01:30:07,976 --> 01:30:10,079
- [Thane] I'm staying.

1367

1367
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:14,630
- That's not exactly Teela, Thane.

1368

1368
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:17,072
- It is, and it isn't,

1369

1369
01:30:17,072 --> 01:30:20,732
but I dedicate myself to her,

1370

1370
01:30:20,732 --> 01:30:23,607
my life and my sword.

1371

1371
01:30:26,557 --> 01:30:29,720
- Rise, Paladin.

1372

1372
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:42,397
- I haven't forgotten, I am here.

1373

1373
01:30:42,397 --> 01:30:46,274
Thane, I am yours as long as you are mine.

1374

1374
01:30:47,325 --> 01:30:50,167
- There she is, Teela my love.

1375

1375
01:30:52,061 --> 01:30:54,141
That's Teela alright.

1376

1376
01:30:54,141 --> 01:30:57,225
- Teela, I'm sorry for what I did.

1377

1377
01:30:57,225 --> 01:30:59,947
- Oh, don't be sorry.

1378

1378
01:30:59,947 --> 01:31:03,125
Yours is the hardest path and the darkest,

1379

1379
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,405
and it will grow darker
still before the end.

1380

1380
01:31:06,405 --> 01:31:08,238
- Thane,

1381

1381
01:31:10,868 --> 01:31:12,532
have a good time.

1382

1382
01:31:12,532 --> 01:31:15,136
You deserve it.

1383

1383
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,444
- Watch out for her.

1384

1384
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:24,688
- You are my first, and truest friend.

1385

1385
01:31:25,995 --> 01:31:30,995
- Marek, I have always believed in you.

1386

1386
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:35,078
If anyone will do it, you will.

1387

1387
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:39,150
- Thane and I will gather
resistance to slow Szorlok.

1388

1388
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:43,108
We will warn the people,
save as many lives as we can.

1389

1389
01:31:43,108 --> 01:31:47,821
- Dagen and I will get that
Hammer, or we'll die trying.

1390

1390
01:31:53,531 --> 01:31:58,531
(blissful music)

1391

1391
01:32:02,718 --> 01:32:05,182
I've made a terrible mistake.

1392

1392
01:32:05,182 --> 01:32:08,318
I've traded the fate of the
world for this hunk of metal.

1393

1393
01:32:08,318 --> 01:32:11,241
- Someone had to choose, Marek.

1394

1394
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:13,248
- Why me?

1395

1395
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:15,329
Why not someone else?

1396

1396
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,027
- Because you're the
only one crazy enough,

1397

1397
01:32:18,027 --> 01:32:20,710
to choose the impossible.

1398

1398
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:25,648
(enchanting music)

1399

1399
01:32:25,648 --> 01:32:30,648
- Just like that, Thane
and Teela, gone in a flash.

1400

1400
01:32:31,555 --> 01:32:33,233
You know, they're probably
at some gloriously

1401

1401
01:32:33,233 --> 01:32:35,955
seedy tavern by now, sipping drinks.

1402

1402
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:40,782
You've teleported before
Marek, what gives?

1403

1403
01:32:40,782 --> 01:32:42,969
- Her magic's not like mine.

1404

1404
01:32:42,969 --> 01:32:44,590
You have to be sanctified.

1405

1405
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:47,151
- Well in that case, you can keep it.

1406

1406
01:32:47,151 --> 01:32:49,054
I'd rather walk.

1407

1407
01:32:52,068 --> 01:32:57,068
How funny would it be, if we
died of thirst after all this.

1408

1408
01:32:58,854 --> 01:32:59,824
- Stop.

1409

1409
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,531
- Stop what?

1410

1410
01:33:01,531 --> 01:33:03,813
- Talking.

1411

1411
01:33:03,813 --> 01:33:08,813
(blissful music)

1412

1412
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,056
(laughs)

1413

1413
01:33:35,188 --> 01:33:40,188
(adventurous music)

1414

1414
01:34:51,211 --> 01:34:55,941
(Love and Duty)

1415

1415
01:35:06,883 --> 01:35:09,905
♫ On the banks of the snowy river

1416

1416
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:12,966
♫ my love and I were merrily wed

1417

1417
01:35:12,966 --> 01:35:16,221
♫ as we felt for a fleeting moment

1418

1418
01:35:16,221 --> 01:35:20,957
♫ that our joy would never end

1419

1419
01:35:22,747 --> 01:35:25,927
♫ for our hearts were bound together

1420

1420
01:35:25,927 --> 01:35:29,138
♫ stronger than an iron wall

1421

1421
01:35:29,138 --> 01:35:32,306
♫ but the sound of the distant battle

1422

1422
01:35:32,306 --> 01:35:36,086
♫ they all meant to hear the call

1423

1423
01:35:36,086 --> 01:35:39,063
♫ stranded between love and duty

1424

1424
01:35:39,063 --> 01:35:42,242
♫ stranded what is there for me

1425

1425
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:45,463
♫ stranded between love and duty

1426

1426
01:35:45,463 --> 01:35:50,098
♫ stranded what is there for me

1427

1427
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:54,809
♫ torn between my solemn beauty

1428

1428
01:35:54,809 --> 01:35:57,852
♫ and the one thing that mattered more

1429

1429
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:01,009
♫ I could not forsake my beauty

1430

1430
01:36:01,009 --> 01:36:04,664
♫ but to face an ugly war

1431

1431
01:36:04,664 --> 01:36:07,801
♫ stranded

1432

1432
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:11,103
♫ stranded

1433

1433
01:36:11,103 --> 01:36:14,303
♫ stranded

1434

1434
01:36:14,303 --> 01:36:16,028
♫ stranded

1435

1435
01:36:16,028 --> 01:36:19,945
♫ what is there for me

1436

1436
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:30,677
♫ so we stowed away by starlight

1437

1437
01:36:30,677 --> 01:36:35,158
♫ and we sailed until we were free

1438

1438
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:39,820
♫ but at times when I look at the mirror

1439

1439
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:44,820
♫ a coward stares back at me

1440

1440
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:51,048
♫ stranded between love and duty

1441

1441
01:36:51,048 --> 01:36:54,102
♫ stranded what is there for me

1442

1442
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:57,390
♫ stranded between love and duty

1443

1443
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:00,645
♫ stranded what is there for me

1444

1444
01:37:00,645 --> 01:37:03,771
♫ stranded between love and duty

1445

1445
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:07,026
♫ stranded what is there for me

1446

1446
01:37:07,026 --> 01:37:10,226
♫ stranded between love and duty

1447

1447
01:37:10,226 --> 01:37:14,817
♫ stranded what is there for me ♫
