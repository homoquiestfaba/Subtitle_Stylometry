(door creaks)

11
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,950
- Yes?

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,535
- [Woman] I'd like
a room, please.

13
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,495
- Well...

14
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,624
I only got one left.

15
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,127
7B, down in the basement.

16
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,461
- [Woman] That sounds fine.

17
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,173
- The air's not too
good down there.

18
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,467
Installed a duct, but
it don't blow through.

19
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,262
- I don't mind.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,891
- Well, there's a boiler down
there. Too big to move out.

21
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,976
- That's no problem.

22
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,187
- Cleaning lady
don't clean much.

23
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,814
She don't like to go down there.

24
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,316
She's afraid of what's
growing down there.

25
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,652
- I could clean it myself.

26
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,572
- Well...

27
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,493
Go ahead and sign in, then.

28
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,846
Well, I hope you enjoy your
stay at the Grand Hotel.

29
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,518
You have a nice evening.

(footsteps clack)

52
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,712
- [Woman] Except for biology.

53
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,132
I always had a talent
for that kinda jig.

54
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,260
And home ec. Baking,
that sort of that.

55
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,930
People are just hungry
to hear about it.

56
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,599
And my job puts me in
contact with a lot of people,

57
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,810
but I don't really know anybody.

58
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,399
Yeah, it's not the most
elegant line of work,

59
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,151
but it pays the bills.

60
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,112
And I'm not gonna be in the
Grand Hotel forever. No, sir.

61
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,657
Sooner or later, hopefully
I'll get enough money

62
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,117
to have my own kind of place.

63
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,329
Maybe get into baking
professionally.

64
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,000
There's a lot of dough
in that line of work.

65
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,297
(sullen orchestral music)

66

(door handle rattles)

69
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,354
- [Woman] Yes?

70
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,272
- All moved in?

71
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,524
- Uh-huh.

72
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,651
- Did you get all
your stuff moved in?

73
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,487
- Yeah, thanks.

74
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,405
- Do you need anything?

75
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,074
- No, I don't think so.

76
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,994
- How would you like
me to check your duct?

77
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,204
- My duct?

78
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,956
- Yeah, the last party
that was in there

79
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,916
said the air didn't
blow through right.

80
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,876
- Uh...

81
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,382
No, it seems fine.

82
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,969
- How would you like
to see a film, then?

83
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,137
- A film?

84
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,890
- Yeah, I got a
pretty good one here.

85
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,725
Educational documentary.

86
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,396
The story of
electromagnetic induction.

87
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,484
- Oh, yeah. I'm
kinda tired, though.

88
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,361
- Oh.

89
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,737
Maybe some other time?

90
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,447
- Uh-huh.

91
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
- Goodnight.

92
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,292

99
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,195
- Who's there?
- Cleaning lady.

100
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,115
- [Woman] Oh, hi.

101
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,784
- I need to clean.

102
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,993
- Um, that's all right.

103
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,328
I'll take care of it myself.

104
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,958
- Well, if that's
the way it has to be.

105
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,756
Just bet you'll do it yourself.

106
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,344
You and that other
one in 6B. (laughs)

107
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,929
Look at this place, it's filthy.

108
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,015
Absolutely filthy. Cobwebs
all over the place.

109
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,059
Well, I'm not gonna take
'em down. No, ma'am.

110
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,479
I wash my hands of it. There's
a limit to what I'll do.

111
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,107
And this place passed
it a long time ago!

172

What're you doing
in a dump like this?

173
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,609
- Oh, renting a room.

174
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,987
- Yeah, what else?

175
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,780
Would you like to come in
for a drink or somethin'?

176
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,992
- I can't right now. I've
gotta check on something.

177
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,994

a rain check, huh?

00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,845
(knocks)

188
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,016
(knocks)

189
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,941
- [Trixie] Hi, Connie!

190
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,192
- Hi, Trixie.

191
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,694
Thought I might take you
up on that rain check.

192
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,445
- Sure thing! Come on in.

193
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,531
Would you like a
drink or somethin'?

194
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,824
- Uh, yeah.

195
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,450
- [Trixie] What'll you have?

196
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,035
- Grain alcohol.

197
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,453
- Huh?

198
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,539
- Or maybe some vodka.

199
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,873
- Ah, gotcha.

200
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,458
I'm glad you could come over.

201
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,546
Took that myself in the middle
of the desert in Nevada.

202
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,673
Been interested in
UFOs ever since.

203
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,049
You believe in 'em?

204
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,970
- (chuckles) No,
I'm afraid I don't.

205
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,764
- There's a lot of weird
things going on up there.

206
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,849
And down here, too.

207
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,394
Some of the freaks I meet

208
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,688
might as well be
from another planet.

209
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,856
(glass clinks)

210
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,065
Here you go.

211
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,316
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

212
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,780
So...

213
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,119
How do you like the Grand Hotel?

214
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,912
- Oh, it's very nice.

215
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,372
- Yeah, right.

216
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,750
They oughta burn it down
and get the insurance money.

217
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,752
You from out of town?
- Um, yes.

218
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,754
I've moved around a lot.

219
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,131
- Yeah, me too. Rootless
is what they call it.

220
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,594
- [Connie] I was most
recently in Chelsea, Idaho.

221
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,720
- Chelsea?

222
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,971
Never heard of it.

223
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,557
- It's a small place,
a company town.

224
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,393
- Hm, I don't know
much about Idaho,

225
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,978
except that it
stems from potatoes.

226
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,772
I read that on a
license plate once.

227
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,692
- Yes, they have lots
of potatoes there.

228
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,862
- [Trixie] Your
folks live there?

229
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,696
- No.

230
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,783
- Hm, I lost mine.

231
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,785
They were flower children.

232
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,787
- They came from flowers?

233
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,038
- (chuckles) Yeah,
right, Connie.

234
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,873
You never heard of
flower children?

235
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,585
- No, I've heard
of flower girls.

236
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,214
- No, flower children
put flowers in their hair

237
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:03,384
and live in shacks and hang
around fields chanting.

238
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,969
That sort of thing.

239
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,972
My parents owned a
potato farm in Mendocino.

240
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,140
A caneel type deal.

241
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,312
But then it caught blight
and they disappeared one day.

242
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,313
Never saw 'em again.

243
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,943
Hit the streets pretty
soon after that.

244
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,778
So, what line of
work are you in?

245
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,404
- Oh, I'm an inventor.

246
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,448
- An inventor?
- Mm-hm!

247
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,243
I used to work for Plasmaster
but now I'm out on my own.

248
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,454
- You know somethin', Connie?

249
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,998
You and me are a lot alike.

250
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,959
I could tell, the
first time I saw ya.

251
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,585
- You could?

252
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,170
- Yeah!

253
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,507
Both stuck in a sewer but we
got big plans for the future.

254
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,513
(muffled scratching)

255
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,682
Not supposed to be any
pets in this hotel.

256
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,519
(door squeaks)

257
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,229
Geez, I thought you were some
kind of aardvark or something!

258
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,356
What the fuck are you doing?

259
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,983
- Ah, nothin'. Just
got another film here.

260
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,442
I thought you'd like to see it.

261
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,944
- Another one of those
damn school movies again?

262
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,990
- [Clerk] Yeah, the story of
electrochemical reactions.

263
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,324
- No, I'm busy.

264
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,951
- Oh, got a customer?

265
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,327
- No, a friend.

266
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,370
- Oh. 7B, eh?

267
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,456
How'd you gals like
to come upstairs

268
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,625
and join me in a libation?

269
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,211
- No, if you don't mind.

270
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,254
(door slams)

271
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,088
- Ah.

272
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,555
(dark orchestral music)

273
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,526
(switch clicks)

274
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,237
- The alien organism
infests the human host

275
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,033
like a neural parasite,
occupying the skull cavity

276
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,411
while maintaining the
host's brain externally.

277
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,246
The body is internally altered

278
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,540
and several new
organs are formed,

279
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,418
including one for
disintegrating the victims

280
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,837
and another for secreting
their brain cells,

281
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,341
compacted and reorganized,
but still alive.

282
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,221
Outwardly, it resembles an
enormous protoplasm or amoeba,

283
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,474
though it is vastly more complex

284
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,019
and seems to possess an almost
diabolical intelligence.

285
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,940
It is capable of
telepathic manipulation

286
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,235
and even psychokinetic changes
in its immediate environment.

287
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,906
This is probably how it has
avoided detection for so long.

288
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,701
(switch clicks)

289
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,295
Good god.

290
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,799
Are they conscious?

291
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,550
Able to think in there,

292
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,512
in some dark limbo?

293
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,142
(switch clicks)

294
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,311
The subconscious mind
of the human host

295
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,689
is not under its control.

296
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:07,068
It is for this reason that the
so-called Dampa Dream Machine

297
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,321
was designed and patented
by Connie Sproutz.

298
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,282
It prevents the dreams
of the alienated brain

299
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,284
from becoming physically real.

300
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,122
(switch clicks)

301
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,130
(switch clicks)

302
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,257
I must emphasize the importance

303
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,552
of destroying the
creature completely.

304
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,097
I disagree strongly with
Dr. Brainard's suggestion

305
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,308
that we attempt to
take the creature alive

306
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,020
for some possible military use.

307
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,772
It is simply too dangerous

308
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,026
and the consequences
could be disastrous.

309
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:53,031
The creature must be
eradicated before it escapes

310
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,034
and finds new victims.

311
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,412
(switch clicks)

312
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,372
(sighs)

313
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,632
(dark orchestral music)

314
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,385
Who were you, Connie Sproutz?

315
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,723
Before that thing found
you and changed you.

316
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,686
I could almost
feel sorry for you.

317
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,318
(door opens)

318
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,905
(door closes)

319
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,407
(heels clack)

320
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,203
(knocks)

321
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,370
- Connie?

322
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,705
(knocks)

323
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,998
Connie, are you in there?

324
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,419
(heels clack)

325
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,675
(electronic humming)

326
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,141
(eerie orchestral music)

327
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,633
(alien laughs)

328
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,427
(ominous tones)

329
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,013
(blood splats)

330
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,143
(organism squelches)

331
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,398
(electronic humming)

332
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,910
(switch clicks)

333
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,571
(liquid splashes)

334
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,133
(dark orchestral music)

335
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,125
- [Connie] The tube
checks out fine.

336
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,294
Not a darn thing wrong with it.

337
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,545
I wonder if it might be

338
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,463
these thunderstorms
we've been having.

339
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,884
I guess I'm just going
to have to stay up

340
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,969
until they blow over.

341
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,141
(water bubbles)

342
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,495
(rapid taps)

343
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,512
(potato crunches)
(screeching)

344
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,600
(dramatic ominous tones)

345
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,393
(potato clunks)

346
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,104
(eyeball squelches)

347
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,815
- Hey, you want
some potato salad?

348
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,984
- No, potatoes
don't agree with me.

349
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,654
Hey, look at that transformer.

350
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,995
- Oh, yeah. What about it?

351
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,455
- Well, I was just thinking

352
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,291
about the low-frequency
radiation.

353
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,294
It affects people living in
the vicinity of the lines.

354
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,629
- Oh, really?

355
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,006
- Yeah, it can even
cause DNA mutations.

356
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,885
- You know something, Connie?

357
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,553
That's what I like about you.

358
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,138
You're always thinking.

359
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,264
Maybe you can think
of a way for us

360
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,849
to get out of that damn hotel.

361
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,646
Maybe we should
run away together.

362
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,857
Somewhere, anywhere
away from that dump.

363
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,484
You know, it's a black hole.

364
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,277
Nothing that gets
in ever gets out.

365
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,906
So, what've you got
to drink around here?

366
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,741
What's this?

367
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,284
- Oh, that's some shine I made.

368
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,661
- You kidding me?

369
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,495
- No.

370
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,916
Oh!

371
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,419
This stuff's got a kick.

372
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,753
- [Connie] It's 198 proof.

373
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,007
- Hot creepers, you drink
this stuff all the time?

374
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,551
Do you want some?

375
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,262
- No, I think I'd
just like some coffee.

376
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,221
- Oh, okay.

377
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,431
You look like you need it.

378
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,224
- Well, I haven't been
sleeping very well.

379
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,728
- Well, some coffee
oughta wake you up.

380
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,233
- Actually it doesn't really
do much for me when I drink it.

381
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,610
- (chuckles) Well, what
else would you do with it?

382
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,949
I haven't been getting my
beauty rest, either, lately.

383
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,705
I keep having these nightmares.

384
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,873
- Dreams are all absurd.

385
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,500
- I don't know
about that, Connie.

386
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,043
I believe you can interpret
your dreams and if you can

387
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,587
interpret your dreams, you
can figure out everything.

388
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,589
You know, exactly what
to do with your life.

389
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,509
- Dreams are nothing but
random electrochemical activity

390
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,886
originating in the cortex.

391
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,388
- In the what?
- The brain stem.

392
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,891
It's the most primitive
part of the mind.

393
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,477
- Geez, Connie, where do
you pick up all this stuff?

394
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,063
- Oh, here and there.
Various people I've...

395
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:24,982
Met.

396
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,775
- Hm.

397
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,360
I admire that.

398
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,821
You know, you're a lot smarter
than your average dope.

399
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:35,659
You oughta be proud of that.
You got brains. (chuckles)

400
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,079
(eerie orchestral music)

401
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,880
(rain splashes)

402
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,135
(water bubbles)

403
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,864
(toilet flushes)

404
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,325
(door creaks)

405
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,246
(clerk yawns)

406
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:16,218
(switch clicks)
(projector whirs)

407
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,514
(upbeat music)

408
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,573
- [Scientist] This
is an ohmmeter.

409
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,367
The ohmmeter measures
electrical resistance in ohms,

410
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,953
and ohms is the unit of
resistance equivalent

411
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,497
to the resistance of an
conductor in which one volt,

412
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,749
the unit difference of...

413
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,464
(doors creak)

414
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,508
(joyful chime music)

415
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,156
(glasses clink)

416
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,283
(projector whirs)

417
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,827
Madam Kildegaard determined
that the current does not flow

418
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,913
unobstructed without
being measured twice.

419
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,582
On Sundays, the current
tends to lessen.

420
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,626
However, voting is permitted.

421
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,089
(dark orchestral music)

422
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,022
(rumbling)

423
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,775
That the potential
difference between two metals

424
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,902
is based upon their
mutual dislike.

425
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,904
If the current flows
between them and the metals

426
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,365
are not in mutual harmony,
a discord will erupt,

427
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,200
producing catastrophic effects,

428
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,662
especially among recourses
that prefer suckers to bonbons.

429
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,455
The Greeks, of course,
discovered electricity,

430
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,916
though they had types
inferior to old Ben Franklin

431
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,168
who could not contain his
flatulence during the meetings

432
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,504
of the Continental First
Congress which meant every day,

433
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,840
except for Sundays, when
the current did not flow,

434
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,717
unless two metals which
detested each other

435
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,552
were in mutual discord
and grated loudly

436
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,679
like the sound of
fingernails on a blackboard,

437
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,097
which Madam Kildegaard detested,

438
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,391
even though she was
very well built.

439
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,476
Speaking of well-built,
the Empire State Building

440
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,062
was well constructed until the
metals in its girder system

441
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,481
expanded and bloated due
to excess stomach acid

442
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,025
and spewed several
albino rhinoceros.

443
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,863
(overlapping garbled chatter)

444
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,789
(rumbling)

445
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,896
(eruptions roar)
(rumbling)

446
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,565
(glasses clink)

447
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,447
(wind blows)

448
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,954
(door creaks)

449
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,511
(distant water drips)

450
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,681
(water drips)

451
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,351
(switch clicks)

452
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,071
(water drips)

453
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,332
(water drips)

454
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,587
(door slams)

455
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,131
- God, I need some coffee.

456
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,728
(coffee splashes)

457
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,457
(water trickles)

458
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,460
(muffled crackling)

459
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,098
(door creaks)

460
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,065
(door creaks)

461
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,077
(muffled rattling)

462
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,046
(muffled rattling)

463
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,640
(rumbling)

464
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,613
- Great Scott.

465
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,116
Could I be having flashbacks?

466
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,744
The lysergic acid experiments.

467
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,416
(latches click)

468
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,822
(switch clicks)

469
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,825
(record crackles)

470
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,828
(jaunty jazz music)

471
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,712
(feet tap rhythmically)

472
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,394
(music speeds up)

473
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:35,532
(heels clack)
(engine hums)

474
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,919
- You feeling lonely tonight?

475
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,712
I sure am.

476
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,299
- You live at the
Grand Hotel, don't you?

477
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,551
- Oh, so you've seen me before!

478
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,386
A secret admirer.

479
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,680
Hey, love that hair!

480
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,224
I do admire distinguished
older gentlemen like you.

481
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,894
- Yes, I'd like to
ask you a question.

482
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,312
- Sure, if it's about money,

483
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,480
I'd like to get that
settled right off the bat.

484
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,231
- (chuckles) No,
it's not about money.

485
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,109
There's another young woman
who lives at the Grand Hotel,

486
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,277
perhaps you know her?

487
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,197
- Sure! A lot of people
live at that dump.

488
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,448
But who cares?

489
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,992
You and me are the only
ones who matter tonight.

490
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,329
Cute coat, it makes
you look so mysterious.

491
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,748
- That will be enough of that.

492
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,796
The other young woman's
name is Connie Sproutz.

493
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,590
- Fuck! A cop!

494
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,258
- Watch your
language, young lady.

495
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,470
I am not a police
officer, I'm a scientist

496
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,180
and an investigator.

497
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,431
I merely wanted to ask you

498
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,433
a few questions
about your friend.

499
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,852
- What friend?
- Connie Sproutz.

500
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,980
I know all about your
acquaintance with
her, Miss Turner.

501
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,942
- Hey! How do you know my name?

502
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,277
- It's my job to know your name.

503
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,613
Dr. Sigmund Sylvanus.

504
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,951
Plasmaster Corporation
Special Investigations Unit.

505
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,952
- Plasmaster?

506
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,914
- Yes, we first became
interested in Connie Sproutz

507
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,917
when she applied for a job
in our research department.

508
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,461
Showed amazing
scientific ability.

509
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,172
You might even say superhuman.

510
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:18,135
Then after the mysterious
death of Dr. Usapius Termaline,

511
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,137
our brilliant head of research,

512
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,764
we decided to launch
a full investigation.

513
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,142
- Oh, really?

514
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,727
That's so fascinating,
I'm about to fall asleep.

515
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,729
- Well, perhaps this
would interest you.

516
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,773
I have learned
several amazing things

517
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,109
about your friend,
Connie Sproutz.

518
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,110
- Who?

519
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,445
- Oh, come, come, Miss Turner.

520
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,823
We know that she lives
right nextdoor to you,

521
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,243
or perhaps I should say,
it lives right nextdoor.

522
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,661
- Hey!

523
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,996
She might not be the
cutest thing under the sun,

524
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,331
but she sure blows your
butt out of the water.

525
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,001
- Now, listen to
me, Miss Turner.

526
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,419
For the last three years,

527
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,130
I have tracked Connie
Sproutz all over this nation.

528
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,008
Everywhere she goes,
people disappear.

529
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,677
- So what? People
disappear all the time.

530
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,763
Why don't you do me a favor
and get lost yourself?

531
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,808
- I am warning you, Miss
Turner, your friend,

532
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:10,520
Connie Sproutz, that
seemingly shy and likable girl

533
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,232
may actually be the result
of an obscene merger

534
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,736
of human and
extraterrestrial DNA.

535
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,946
- What psycho ward did
you check out of, huh?

536
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,199
- I'm telling you this
for your own good.

537
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,451
Look, I've almost
completed my report!

538
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,370
- We're finished here, bud!

539
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,039
- But, please, I...

540
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,458
(door slams)

541
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:40,217
(eerie orchestral music)

542
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,941
(ominous orchestral music)

543
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,789
(hurried footsteps clack)

544
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:15,961
(door creaks)

545
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,630
(switch clicks)

546
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,056
(dramatic ominous tones)

547
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,272
(sullen orchestral music)

548
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,246
(footsteps clack)

549
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,305
(door creaks)

550
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,308
(suspenseful music)

551
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,150
(footsteps clack)

552
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,156
(door creaks)

553
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,495
(door closes)

554
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,214
(footsteps clack)

555
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:08,031
(door creaks)
(computer whines softly)

556
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,846
Miss Sproutz, what a pleasure.

557
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,058
Dr. Sigmund Sylvanus,
Plasmaster Corporation.

558
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,228
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

559
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,605
- All right, you've got me
here. Now where's the brain?

560
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,399
- (chuckles) Right this way.

561
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,151
This is my home away from
home, do you like it?

562
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,737
Oh, it's nothing like
my own lab in Chelsea,

563
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,281
but it's sufficient
for my needs.

564
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,159
Here we are.
(ominous music)

565
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,537
Just a moment, Miss Sproutz.

566
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,790
May I call you
Connie? (chuckles)

567
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,792
Seems as though I know you,

568
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,920
after following your career
for the past three years.

569
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,755
- Why? What do
you care about me?

570
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,383
- Oh, Plasmaster cares a great
deal about you, Miss Sproutz.

571
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,927
- Plasmaster? I've
never heard of it.

572
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,846
- Oh, come, come, Miss Sproutz.

573
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,682
I know all about your
work for Dr. Termaline

574
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,934
in our research and
development lab.

575
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,520
You were his best
pupil, weren't you?

576
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,814
Yes, you had quite a
bright future ahead of you

577
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,858
with Plasmaster, didn't you?

578
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,862
Pet of Dr. Termaline, darling
of the Board of Directors.

579
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,780
Termaline was a great scientist,

580
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,116
possibly the greatest
of this century,

581
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,327
and how did you repay him for
his tutelage and his kindness?

582
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,663
How, Miss Sproutz?
- Leave me alone!

583
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:43,668
- By turning him into
a disgusting mass
of organic sludge!

584
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,962
And eating him.
- I didn't mean to!

585
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,090
- No, no, no more than
you meant to disintegrate

586
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,177
and cannibalize those
countless fringe dwellers

587
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,262
and transients
that you murdered.

588
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,599
- I didn't murder anyone,
they're still alive.

589
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,142
- You call that living?

590
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,855
Being trapped in pulpy nodule
of undifferentiated cells?

591
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,399
- Give me my brain!

592
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,818
What do you think you're doing?

593
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,945
- Nothing to worry
about, Miss Sproutz.

594
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,407
The Plasmaster Neural
Vibrator merely induces

595
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:18,620
a semi-hypnotic state
similar to REM stage sleep.

596
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,998
There's nothing to be afraid of.

597
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,791
- I wouldn't do
that, if I were you.

598
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,171
(device hums)

599
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,842
(gasps)
(ominous music)

600
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,348
- Connie?

601
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,360
(computer whines softly)

602
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,824
- Arrhythmic heartbeat.

603
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,134
Caustic spore's regenerating.

604
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,344
Cycle not yet complete.

605
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,264
(distant rumbling)

606
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,904
- All right, you
pervert. Back off!

607
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,197
Connie?

608
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,949
What did you do to her?

609
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,493
- Miss Turner, I must insist
that you leave at once.

610
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,204
You're interrupting a very
important investigation,

611
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,249
authorized by the
Plasmaster Corporation.

612
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,084
- Can you carry a tune?

613
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,628
- What? Can I carry a tune?

614
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,171
Yes, as a matter of fact,

615
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,966
I happen to sing baritone
with a barbershop quartet,

616
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,260
but I fail to see the
relevance of that, I...

617
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,680
- Well, I'll tell you.

618
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,557
If you don't get out of here
right now, you're going to be

619
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,935
singing soprano with
the piano boys choir.

620
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,687
- Please, Miss
Turner, I implore you.

621
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,856
You're dealing with
a dangerous mutant.

622
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,108
- Oh, is that what you are?
Well, I had my suspicions.

623
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,193
Now back off, Jack!

624
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,403
Connie?

625
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,946
Connie, wake up. We've
gotta get you out.

626
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:17,780
(gasps)

627
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,490
(ominous music)

628
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,910
- There, you see? Is that
what you call a friend?

629
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,831
This thing, this aberration
that calls itself Connie Sproutz

630
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,126
is an inhuman creature
that has killed hundreds,

631
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,670
perhaps thousands
of innocent people.

632
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,130
- I don't believe you.

633
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,048
That's Connie.

634
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,135
She's my friend.
- No, she's no one's friend.

635
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,847
She's a disease, she's a
germ that must be isolated,

636
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:46,517
studied, classified and stamped
out for the good of society.

637
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,689
- Connie, it's okay.
- Trixie.

638
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,737
(Sigmund grunts)

639
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,697
(sinister orchestral music)

640
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,490
- Ow!

641
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:10,917
(device buzzes)
(Sigmund groans)

642
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,137
Here we are.

643
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,519
That Sylvanus creep is out cold.

644
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,688
You'll be safe here
for a little bit.

645
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,948
That's a pretty bad zit
you got there, Connie.

646
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,157
I have a plastic surgeon friend

647
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:43,950
who could take
care of it for ya.

648
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,118
He does real good work.

649
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,375
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go get
packed and you wait here, okay?

650
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,378
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

651
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,880
(heels clack)

652
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,508
(door creaks)

653
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,885
(door closes)

654
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,561
(dark orchestral music)

655
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,565
(gasps)

656
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,567
(yelps)

657
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,915
(slap)

658
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,839
(Connie gasps)

659
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:02,236
(intense orchestral music)

660
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,832
(clerk laughs maniacally)

661
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,628
(suspenseful music)

662
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,297
- [Clerk] I know you're
in there, 7B. (laughs)

663
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,131
Come on!

664
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:28,346
(laughs)
(intense orchestral music)

665
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,876
(footsteps shuffle and clack)

666
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,092
(intense orchestral music)

667
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,573
(fluid squelches)

668

(Trixie gasps)

675
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,037

(device crackles)

688
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,296
- Connie?

689
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:43,757
Connie?

690
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,116
(wind blows)
