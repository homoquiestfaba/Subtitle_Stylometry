00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:17,462
Are they gone?

3
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:22,463
Stay down, Eric.

4
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:49,282
We have to go, now!

5
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:14,974
Eric, where's Eric?

6
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,607
Eric!

7
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:23,608
Move. Now! Son, do it!

8
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,043
Robert!

9
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:43,044
No!

10
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:52,845
You monster!

11
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:38,451
Extra! Extra!

12
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:55,551
Showoff.

13
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,312
Look at that! It's
richthofen, gotta be!

14
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:07,313
Hey, wait a minute! He
can't fly that low!

15
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,123
Coming through. Pardon me.

16
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:46,666
Look at this place. Excuse me.

17
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:51,667
Well, that was a long trip.

18
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,553
Good to see you, shah.

19
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,346
Today's the big day, captain.

20
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:01,306
Yeah.

21
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:04,267
Huh. Don't look so happy
about it. You deserve it.

22
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,686
We deserve it. Now
we'd better go.

23
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:11,687
The general's not the kind of
man you want to keep waiting.

24
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,453
There should be five thousand
troops here, not two.

25
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:26,956
The recalls of our troops and
equipment are bleeding us dry.

26
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:30,126
Those fools in Europe would rather
prepare to fight each other

27
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,211
than the martians.

28
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:32,629
We will be enough.

29
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,089
Do you really believe
that, Theodore?

30
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,383
I won't allow myself to
believe anything else.

31
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:41,304
I'm under pressure to come home. I
don't know how long I can stall.

32
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:42,806
Good morning, captain.

33
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,600
Lieutenant Carter.

34
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,812
Hey. When this is over,
maybe you and I could...

35
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,814
When hell freezes over.

36
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,108
Well, I think there's a
wee chill in the air.

37
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:55,110
You don't know what you're
missing, Jennifer my darlin'.

38
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:59,280
That's lieutenant Carter...
Corporal.

39
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:04,281
Yes, sir. I mean, ma'am.

40
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:10,208
Ladies and gentlemen. If I
may have your attention.

41
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,562
As you know, 15 years
ago, the martians

42
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,234
launched their unprovoked
attack against us.

43
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:24,718
Over 140 million of
us were murdered.

44
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:27,851
And many of our great
cities laid to waste.

45
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,522
Until the invaders were
beaten by the smallest

46
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,877
of earth's living creatures...
The germ.

47
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:41,694
From that destruction, we formed the allied
resistance earth squadrons, a.R.E.S.

48
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:48,701
From the best of our planet's armies. To
make sure that it never happened again.

49
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,210
Professor Tesla, a.R.E.S.
Chief of science

50
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:59,211
and the man responsible for unlocking
the secrets of martian technology

51
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:03,219
has made an alarming discovery.

52
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,306
Professor Tesla.

53
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,141
Good afternoon.

54
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:13,142
Mars' orbit is once again approaching
a time of close proximity to earth.

55
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:18,314
I have detected large scale fluctuations of
magnetic energy from the martian surface.

56
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:23,781
Along with a series of low
frequency radio signals.

57
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:27,327
It is my belief that the signals
are a martian military code

58
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,746
hidden within sunspot activity.

59
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:33,791
That they and the magnetic energy
coming from the planet's surface

60
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,586
serve as a prelude
to an invasion.

61
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,839
An invasion?

62
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,175
How soon?

63
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:45,053
Weeks... days... hours.

64
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,222
So you have no idea!

65
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:51,517
I do. They will come when they
are ready and we are not.

66
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:56,518
So we must get ready... now!

67
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:10,328
This is our new achilles
class battle tripod

68
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,958
65 feet tall... a heavy machine
gun and six light rockets

69
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,044
heat ray with an effective
range of a thousand meters.

70
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:23,045
And an 88 millimeter
Cannon on full turret.

71
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:27,136
Because of their outstanding performance
in recent battle simulations

72
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:30,974
the honor of command of the
first of these will go

73
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:35,019
to captain Eric
Wells and his crew.

74
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,896
Don't be shy, captain.

75
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:41,897
I give you Eric Wells from england,
lieutenant Jennifer Carter from the U.S.,

76
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,320
corporal Patrick o'brien from Ireland,
sergeant Abraham Douglas from Canada,

77
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:54,330
and lieutenant raja
iskandar shah from malaya.

78
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:59,331
Have you thought
of a name for her?

79
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,421
The goliath, sir.

80
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:03,881
Ah, an excellent choice.

81
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:08,177
Tomorrow you will all be
divided into two equal forces.

82
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:11,055
To further our preparations
for the coming conflict

83
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:13,182
we will stage a war game.

84
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:16,602
Blue team will be under the
command of captain Wells.

85
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:21,316
Your force will consist of French,
Italian and Indian tripods.

86
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:25,320
The red team of Korean,
German and Austrian tripods

87
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:28,281
will be under the command
of captain sakai.

88
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:31,826
My money's on sakai!
Twenty on Wells!

89
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,912
Nothing can prepare
you for war itself.

90
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:38,875
The sound... smell... fear...

91
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,710
Death is ugly.

92
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:45,711
All you can do is make sure
it is your enemy that dies.

93
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:51,637
So prepare yourselves.

94
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:54,932
Know what you fight for...
Who you fight for.

95
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:59,933
This time... we will be ready!

96
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:15,495
Come.

97
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:16,371
Good evening, sir.

98
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:21,250
Sarge, you don't have to address me as
'sir'... 'Cap' or even 'Eric' is fine.

99
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,710
Sorry, sir.

100
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:26,422
A bunch of us are going to the green
man to let off a little steam.

101
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:29,884
Thanks, but I have a few
things I need to check over.

102
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:34,885
I spoke to lieutenant Carter.
She asked if you were coming.

103
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,934
She did?

104
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:42,935
I guess one beer wouldn't hurt.

105
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:54,992
So... is it true your
father owns a rail road?

106
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:59,993
No. He owns two.

107
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,127
So tell us, darlin', what's a rich
bird like you doing in a.R.E.S.?

108
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:06,712
I don't think that's any of
your business, corporal.

109
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:10,007
Why don't you let the lieutenant tell
me what is and isn't my business.

110
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:11,134
Captain?

111
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:16,135
Hey, it's okay. My father
viewed me as his property.

112
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,640
To be what he wanted. To marry whom
he wanted. I saw it differently.

113
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:27,813
And I'm glad you did. Just the
sight of you brightens my day.

114
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,070
Atten-hut!

115
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,447
It's Roosevelt!

116
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:37,448
Please, at ease folks... sit...
Enjoy yourselves.

117
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:40,455
Tonight I'm not the
secretary of war.

118
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:45,168
I'm just an old soldier named Teddy
who could use a drink with friends.

119
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,711
May I join you?

120
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:51,174
Of course, sir. I'll
get us another round.

121
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:53,551
Thank you, captain,
but I'll pass.

122
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:56,220
Told Tessa and the girls
that I'd be home early.

123
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:58,347
My best to the family, Abe.

124
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,725
Thank you, sir.

125
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:05,563
This business in Europe is no good.
The Balkans are about to go to hell.

126
00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:08,232
Countries mobilizing
against each other

127
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:12,111
unless we are united,
mankind is done for.

128
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,530
Humanity will rise
to the occasion.

129
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:15,990
You think so?

130
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:20,991
It is my hope, and my prayer. If
it is our destiny, only God knows.

131
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,956
Wisely said, sir.

132
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:28,878
Tell me, o'brien, does it bother
you to serve under an englishman?

133
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:33,879
I'm an ulsterman from the north.
My loyalties are to the crown.

134
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:38,554
Oh really? I heard your
brother was I.R.A.

135
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:42,141
My brother's his own man, Mr.
secretary. As am I.

136
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:43,893
I've not seen him
for three years.

137
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:48,894
Besides he's harmless. He'd walk over
ten naked women to get to a pint.

138
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:53,402
If you'll excuse me.

139
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:58,403
Of course.

140
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Nice night.

141
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:17,965
Mind telling me what
kind of mood he's in.

142
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:25,560
Here you go, boyos.

143
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:30,561
With this, we can blow all
downing street to hell.

144
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:34,777
You shoot me, brother, and
there'll be hell to pay with ma.

145
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:39,778
If it ain't the
hero of a.R.E.S.

146
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,579
Get out the whiskey, Liam.

147
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,546
To me baby brother, who will help
us hijack enough heat rays tonight

148
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:57,508
to blast the bloody English out
of Ireland, once and for all.

149
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:01,220
Slainte mhaith!

150
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:04,473
Maybe we can even get our mitts on
one of them new battle tripods.

151
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,559
Okay, bucko. When and where?

152
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,394
Look, Sean, there's
been a complication.

153
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,813
Don't be playing with your
older brother now, paddy.

154
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:13,608
We've been called up for war
games. The whole base is on alert.

155
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,235
When then? Tomorrow?
The day after?

156
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:21,236
I... I'll let you know. Look...
I have to get back.

157
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,369
You're not going yellow
on us now, are ya, paddy?

158
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,205
Shut yer gob, o'Rourke.
My brother's no coward.

159
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,915
I just need time.

160
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,460
Europe's about to explode
and take england with it.

161
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:36,088
We either make our move when it
does, or we'll never be free.

162
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,089
I know that.

163
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,967
Know this too, boyo.
You took the oath.

164
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:44,968
You break it, brother or
no, I'll kill you dead.

165
00:19:56,026 --> 00:20:01,026
To the crew of the goliath.
The best of the best.

166
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:06,744
I'd rather drink piss
than drink to them.

167
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:10,665
What did he say?

168
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:15,666
Excuse me. Did you
just say something?

169
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:20,921
He is drunk. Ignore him.

170
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:27,344
I said, I'd rather drink
piss than drink to them.

171
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:31,394
Simulations and
games mean nothing.

172
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:36,395
And don't think that farting match
with Spain and Cuba was a war

173
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:40,027
if Germany was involved we
would have ended it in a week.

174
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:44,365
Everyone knows that the Germans are
the best soldiers in the world.

175
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:49,366
And after we kick Europe's ass, we'll
come for you in America... Teddy.

176
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,963
I said, we'll come for you!

177
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:03,342
Well then, why don't we start...
Now!

178
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:08,343
Haha, now we're talking!

179
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:25,569
I say, how was that bit
of simulation, old boy?

180
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:50,598
Today, at 11am in Sarajevo...

181
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:54,101
Archduke Franz ferdinand
was assassinated.

182
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:57,396
What does this mean?
There will be war.

183
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:01,275
When you return to a.R.E.S., you
will find cables from your homelands

184
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:04,361
recalling you to service
in your national armies.

185
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:07,615
This cannot be. What
about the martians?

186
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,493
They will just have
fewer of us to kill.

187
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:13,913
What can we do?

188
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,915
It is our duty.

189
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:16,916
We must leave.

190
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,626
No.

191
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:19,919
What did you say?

192
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,920
I said... no!

193
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:31,301
We're not just French, or German
or Japanese we are a.R.E.S.

194
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,727
We are human.

195
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:40,231
I have seen what the
martians will do.

196
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:44,610
They will murder our brothers...
Our wives... our children...

197
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:46,821
And if you are lucky
enough to survive

198
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:48,948
you will spend the rest
of your miserable lives

199
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:50,950
running like hunted animals.

200
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:55,037
Always knowing that because of
your cowardice, in this moment

201
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,706
everything you loved was dead.

202
00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:59,667
We will be traitors
to our homeland.

203
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:01,836
It is they who are the traitors.

204
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:06,465
Those pompous arrogant fools
who call you to their war.

205
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:08,425
They say they fight
for their honor

206
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:11,220
when it is only for their
greed and their vanity.

207
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:16,221
We must remain together...
We must fight as one.

208
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:21,726
I ask you... I beg you...
Who will fight with me?

209
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:27,274
Who will live and
die my brother?

210
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:33,242
I will... Deutschland
can kiss my ass.

211
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:34,660
As will I.

212
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:35,536
A.R.E.S.!

213
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:40,537
A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!
A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!

214
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,710
A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!
A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!

215
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:28,631
It had to be you.

216
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:30,758
Just checking on a few things.

217
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,426
For what? The tenth time?

218
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,929
Seventh, but who's counting?

219
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,388
It'll be fine.

220
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:37,973
I know...

221
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:40,434
No, you don't, but you should.

222
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,686
You were the best
captain in training.

223
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:45,439
Training is not reality.

224
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,944
When my parents were killed...

225
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,195
I froze.

226
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:54,073
You were 10 years old...

227
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:57,534
Right... um... if
you don't mind...

228
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,870
Sure.

229
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:02,623
Oh um... that guy tonight...

230
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:05,584
The one who spoke and kept all
of a.R.E.S. From running home.

231
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:10,585
That man... he wouldn't
freeze in battle.

232
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:51,630
Tripods are loaded and secure
general. All gangways retracted.

233
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:56,631
Open the canopy.

234
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:04,973
Release ties.

235
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:21,035
Seventy knots. North northeast.

236
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:26,036
Seventy knots. North northeast.

237
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,294
Steady as she goes.

238
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:35,295
Steady as she goes.

239
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:46,389
Captain sakai, your red forces will
mass 20 Miles north of ellenville.

240
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:49,063
Captain Wells, your blues will
be 20 Miles to the South.

241
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:52,691
Your goal is simple. Destroy
the force facing you.

242
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:56,528
All heat rays will be set on only
enough power to mark your enemy.

243
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,529
This won't be war, but it
is as close as we can get.

244
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,710
Looks like there's a river
about 12 Miles east.

245
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,546
We'll spread the team
a mile wide and wait.

246
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:59,967
When they hit the middle of
the river, we'll open up.

247
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:02,761
I know captain sakai.
The man is a samurai.

248
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:05,639
He will attack full force
in the center of our line.

249
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,643
Scouts one through five... I want
you a thousand yards to point.

250
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:14,398
Scouts six and seven, right.
Eight through ten, left.

251
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,775
No one gets on our flanks
without us knowing.

252
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,862
If you see the enemy, you are
to report back. Do not engage.

253
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:22,406
I repeat. Do not engage.

254
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:27,407
I want them coming to us.
Not digging in.

255
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,439
The storm is distorting all
communications between the leviathan

256
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,607
and the blue and red teams.

257
00:28:56,608 --> 00:29:00,777
I don't like it. Get
me Professor Tesla.

258
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,531
Sorry, sir. The storm.

259
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:09,532
I don't like it at all.

260
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:31,433
Alright, men. We wait.

261
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:36,434
If shah is right, sakai should
be arriving in 20 minutes.

262
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:10,885
There's something
wrong here, captain.

263
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:23,527
Sakai must have forgotten
to lower his power levels.

264
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:26,363
That wasn't sakai.

265
00:30:26,364 --> 00:30:31,364
Martians!

266
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,625
Hendrix... hendrix!

267
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:43,626
Hendrix is dead!

268
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,719
What the hell's
going on out there?

269
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Sir... captain... your orders!

270
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,435
Incoming!

271
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:57,436
Captain Wells!

272
00:30:57,437 --> 00:31:01,315
Eric, move!

273
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:05,444
Get a message to the leviathan
that we are under attack.

274
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:09,448
Blue team, this is not a drill.
Full power to heat rays.

275
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:12,451
Replace paint with live
armaments and fire at will.

276
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:13,869
Ready when you are, Eric.

277
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,870
Let's blow these
monsters to hell.

278
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:26,048
Desalvo! Get out!

279
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,800
Come on, boys, pour it on!

280
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:31,053
Engaging!

281
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:32,054
Keep firing!

282
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:37,055
Yes, sir.

283
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:50,318
I got him, I got him!

284
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:57,533
De wolf! Hold the line!

285
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:03,623
Jennifer! On your right!

286
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:07,464
Jennifer, fire up that heat ray!
Now!

287
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:11,885
Twenty degrees right. Distance five
hundred yards. Elevation ninety feet.

288
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:16,515
Damn you, die!

289
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:19,559
Good shooting, lieutenant.
Maintain fire!

290
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Yes, sir.

291
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,695
My God!

292
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:34,282
Duncan is down!

293
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:39,283
Where's sakai?

294
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:46,124
Captain. It's red team!

295
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:54,841
Red team, fire at will.

296
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,942
Let's finish this.

297
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:10,318
Yes, sir.

298
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,279
Ready when you are, Eric.

299
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Ready when you are.

300
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:57,403
They're entering our atmosphere.
The invasion has begun captain.

301
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:05,332
Congratulations on
your victory, captain.

302
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,501
We have 57 dead 17 injured.

303
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:10,420
We lost six scouts, four
spartans, six achilles.

304
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:14,007
You'll excuse me, sir, if I
don't think of it as a victory.

305
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:16,218
Was the enemy destroyed?

306
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:16,968
Yes, sir.

307
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,221
Then it was a victory, captain.

308
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,640
The aliens are bigger, stronger
and faster than they were.

309
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:23,975
It's not supposed to be easy.

310
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:25,644
Why didn't they land in force?

311
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:28,104
It was a probe to test
our capabilities.

312
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:30,899
Now they know what
they are fighting.

313
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,777
Sir, we've just gotten word of
landings throughout Europe and Asia,

314
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,779
but the martians seem to be
concentrating their forces

315
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,280
in north America.

316
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:38,615
Where?

317
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:42,244
Montreal, new Orleans. The
largest is in new Mexico.

318
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:44,663
Our bases in Europe and
Asia will respond.

319
00:34:44,664 --> 00:34:48,041
Take us back to a.R.E.S. I
want a full mobilization.

320
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:51,211
All leaves are cancelled. All troops
are to report to their units.

321
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:54,756
Strike forces will be armed,
outfitted and ready to leave

322
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,591
in three hours.

323
00:34:56,592 --> 00:35:01,471
Gentlemen, I believe their little
European war has just been cancelled.

324
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:02,764
Are we ready, sir?

325
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:07,765
We better be.

326
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,201
Me thinks your brother
has turned, Sean.

327
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:10,202
He'll be here.
What'd I tell you?

328
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:16,713
Where are they?

329
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:18,256
The martians are back.

330
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:22,010
I didn't ask you about the martians,
brother. I asked about the heat rays.

331
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:23,637
We're at war, Sean.

332
00:36:23,638 --> 00:36:25,764
Yeah. With the English.

333
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:26,931
I have no weapons for you.

334
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:30,852
You're some kinda piss, paddy!

335
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:32,771
Don't you get it, bucko?

336
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:35,273
We'd all rather be dead at
the hands of the martians

337
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:38,401
than live under English tyranny.
You've betrayed us.

338
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:43,402
I betrayed nobody. Sean, this
is bigger than just Ireland.

339
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:48,536
Goodbye, Sean. Tell
ma I loved her.

340
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:51,623
Go, on, shoot the
bloody traitor!

341
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:55,585
Damn, if you're going to
be a woman about it...

342
00:36:55,586 --> 00:37:00,586
Put him in the truck. Patrick!
You're dead to me.

343
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:06,888
Get those stormcrows in the air now!
I want 24 hour air cover! Let's go!

344
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:10,183
I want the battlecruisers repulse and
Bismarck to support new Orleans.

345
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:14,229
I want the atlas rolling at flank
speed to Montreal with the agamemnon.

346
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,481
The minotaur will follow us.

347
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:17,982
Anything we can do?

348
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,818
We'll be in new
Mexico at dawn.

349
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:24,819
Until then, you can
rest and you can pray.

350
00:37:58,149 --> 00:38:00,066
I never thought this
day would come.

351
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,485
I thought the bacteria
would keep us safe.

352
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:06,740
Well, looks like the ugly
buggers developed an immunity.

353
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:11,741
Godspeed men, and give 'em hell.

354
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:35,435
Are we fit for battle?

355
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,396
Would I be coming down
now if we weren't, sir?

356
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:43,397
No, of course you wouldn't.
Please accept my apology.

357
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:46,696
Why don't you hate the British?

358
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:49,324
From what I hear, your people
were living in palaces

359
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,785
when the brits were in caves.

360
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:54,746
Now you're a colony.
They own your asses

361
00:38:54,747 --> 00:38:57,165
and treat you like
you were savages.

362
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:01,252
As Shakespeare said, 'there is
no darkness but ignorance.'

363
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:04,839
Shakespeare... where'd
you learn that?

364
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,090
Oxford.

365
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:09,844
How did a 'wog', no
offense, get to Oxford?

366
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:14,390
I used to be a prince. My family
disowned me for joining a.R.E.S.

367
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:16,684
I know how that feels.
My brother...

368
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:20,230
Wanted you to steal weapons for the
fenians to use against the British.

369
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:21,105
You knew?

370
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:24,734
I saw you leave the bar the other
night and guessed the rest.

371
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,986
You didn't report me?

372
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:29,489
No. I trusted you.

373
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,117
Then I checked the inventory to
see if any weapons were missing.

374
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:38,118
You did the right
thing, Patrick.

375
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:46,631
Coffee?

376
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:49,342
Thanks. What are
you smiling about?

377
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,593
Tomorrow.

378
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:52,846
You actually look
forward to battle?

379
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:57,847
A four hundred knot dive out of the
sun... guns blazing at the enemy...

380
00:39:57,893 --> 00:40:01,020
For me it is better
than schnapps!

381
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:03,857
I think you're a
little crazy, manfred.

382
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:05,775
I think I have to be.

383
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:09,237
I wish I were more
like you, my friend.

384
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:13,908
We are not so different. Except I
carry only my own life in my plane.

385
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:16,995
You... you carry the
lives of your crew.

386
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:21,996
Get some sleep. Tomorrow
we find our destiny, ya?

387
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:46,900
General, we have contact.

388
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:50,278
Nine martian aircraft bearing
sixty degrees north by northwest.

389
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,530
Hundred and twenty five
Miles out and closing.

390
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:57,531
Battle stations.
Launch all fighters.

391
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:38,117
Stormcrows, head 26°
north northwest.

392
00:41:38,118 --> 00:41:41,746
We must protect the leviathan.
Nothing gets through us.

393
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:46,376
Remember, your heat rays will need a
three minute recharge after firing, so

394
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,920
rely on your rockets
and machine guns.

395
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:53,921
Good hunting.

396
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:04,682
Valkyries, on me!

397
00:42:06,772 --> 00:42:11,772
Stormcrows! Maintain formation.

398
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:19,697
Here they come!

399
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:24,914
Break! Break!

400
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:27,917
Where is he? I can't see him!

401
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:32,918
Got him!

402
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:43,224
Bank hard left.

403
00:42:43,225 --> 00:42:44,600
There are too many!

404
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:49,601
Where the hell is richthofen?

405
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,130
I'm hit! I'm hit!

406
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,599
They are heading
for the leviathan.

407
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:32,565
Targeting. Bearing 33°.

408
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:37,566
Richthofen!

409
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:51,705
Leaving the dance early, ya?
It's just you and me, fraulein.

410
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:52,349
Come on, come on... charge!

411
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:23,342
Report.

412
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:26,095
We lost three valkyries
and seven stormcrows.

413
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:28,723
Seven martian craft
are confirmed down.

414
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:31,976
The last two broke off
their attack and ran home.

415
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,896
They are faster than we are.
But we turn quicker.

416
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:38,524
Sir, just gotten word of 15 tripods
supported by a dozen martian wings

417
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:40,109
driving towards Albuquerque.

418
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,070
Move to intercept. I want
scouts dropped down behind them

419
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:45,114
to monitor their approach.

420
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:50,115
You can grieve for your dead
later. We'll need you in the air.

421
00:46:07,638 --> 00:46:10,723
Gentlemen, we will place our
heaviest tripods in a line...

422
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,725
Below that low Ridge.

423
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:15,686
The rest will deploy with all
ground troops and the militia here

424
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:17,146
on both sides of the canyon.

425
00:46:17,147 --> 00:46:20,233
The leviathan will take up
stations in the clouds above us.

426
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:25,234
With any luck, we will catch
the invaders in a killing box.

427
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,657
Someone put that fire out!

428
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:31,118
Get him out of there!

429
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,331
General... there weren't
fifteen. There were only twelve.

430
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:39,252
Those three tripods are
somewhere. If they outflank us...

431
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:42,004
Take the beowulf and
three scouts. Find them.

432
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:43,381
Yes, sir.

433
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:48,382
And get this man to a doctor.

434
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,994
Let's look sharp.
They must be close.

435
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:15,913
I think dividing our
forces was a dumb idea.

436
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:19,583
I don't remember anybody caring
what you thought, o'brien.

437
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:24,584
Those creatures
could be anywhere.

438
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:41,018
Sir, it's a trap!

439
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:50,819
Scouts! Pull back!

440
00:47:55,704 --> 00:48:00,704
Goliath! Beowulf! Fire at will!

441
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:05,834
Locked on target.

442
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:09,842
Abe, let them have it!

443
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:13,137
Yes, sir!

444
00:48:13,138 --> 00:48:16,557
Take evasive action, beowulf!

445
00:48:16,558 --> 00:48:21,395
No!

446
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:26,396
Fire all weapons. Give
them everything we've got.

447
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:39,622
Where are the others?

448
00:48:39,623 --> 00:48:44,623
These creatures always
move in threes.

449
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,639
We're losing hydraulics!

450
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,640
Brace for impact!

451
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:29,751
I need that heat ray!

452
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,698
Weapon systems report!

453
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:58,409
The heat Ray's gone to hell.

454
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,368
We're blind.

455
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:01,245
I've got no power here, captain.

456
00:50:01,246 --> 00:50:02,913
Abe! Status report.

457
00:50:02,914 --> 00:50:05,082
I've got no movement
and no shot.

458
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:10,083
Maybe we'll get lucky...

459
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:18,721
That thing is on the move.
Abe, can you sight on him?

460
00:50:18,722 --> 00:50:19,430
I've got a shot.

461
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:24,431
Take it!

462
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:29,853
You got him!

463
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:52,379
All dead, captain.

464
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,424
They were good men.

465
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:58,886
It's just a scratch. I'm okay.

466
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:00,387
We've got to move out.

467
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:02,515
We should bury the
beowulf's crew.

468
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:06,310
There is no time.

469
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:09,188
If we stay with the goliath, we'll
have a better chance of being found.

470
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:12,608
Our mission is to find
those remaining tripods.

471
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:14,360
That is what I intend to do.

472
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:19,240
On foot? No thanks. I didn't join
a.R.E.S. To be in the bloody infantry.

473
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:22,284
You either follow orders...

474
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:24,578
Or what? You're
going to shoot me?

475
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:29,579
Yes.

476
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:44,598
I think it's dead.

477
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:47,726
Yeah. I just like
to see 'em bleed!

478
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:50,729
If there are anymore
around, they'll hear you.

479
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,856
Thank you. Your
squad saved us.

480
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:56,151
Ain't no more squad...
Except me.

481
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:57,987
Hope your sorry <i>asses</i>
 were worth it.

482
00:51:57,988 --> 00:52:00,239
Where are you going?

483
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,241
To kill me some more tripods.

484
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:03,617
You know where they are?

485
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:08,618
Hell, I know where
them bastards live.

486
00:52:12,377 --> 00:52:16,338
After they burnt out espanola
and blowed up my wife...

487
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:19,675
I joined that militia...

488
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:24,676
They thought they got my Lucy,
oh no no no, I fooled 'em good.

489
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:27,224
Er... how'd you do that?

490
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:32,225
Huh...? I found a piece of her.
See?

491
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:36,942
You see what's leading us... the
man's out of his bleeding mind.

492
00:52:36,943 --> 00:52:39,612
He's keeping his dead wife's
finger around his neck.

493
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:41,614
You ever in love, o'brien?

494
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:42,990
Dozens of times.

495
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:45,784
Anyone ever tell you,
you don't know shit?

496
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:46,994
What'd I say?

497
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:51,373
Abe wasn't talking about lust.
He was talking about love.

498
00:52:51,374 --> 00:52:56,374
What's the difference?

499
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:04,511
It's the other tripod. Looks like it's
guarding some sort of power plant.

500
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:06,472
You thinking of storming
the castle, captain...

501
00:53:06,473 --> 00:53:09,058
With one heat ray
and a pea shooter?

502
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,436
They're here for a reason.
We need to get inside.

503
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:14,772
Are you nuts... sir?

504
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:16,357
How the hell are we
going to do that?

505
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:21,358
My guess is you're gonna
be needing a distraction.

506
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:31,538
We'll find another way.

507
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:35,209
Lucy and me both know
there is no other way.

508
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,085
What's that?

509
00:53:36,086 --> 00:53:41,086
Lucy says it was good meeting you.
Even if you are a damn limey.

510
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:46,053
Now what?

511
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:48,389
We wait... for his signal.

512
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,140
The emergency transponder.

513
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:52,226
The martians seem to
know when we're coming.

514
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:56,438
I'm changing the frequency. Hopefully
they won't be monitoring them.

515
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:59,483
And hopefully the
leviathan will.

516
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:04,484
Okay you slimy
sons-of-bitches, here I come!

517
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:18,832
Let's go.

518
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:33,638
That's one crazy cowboy.

519
00:54:52,287 --> 00:54:57,287
I'm comin' home, honey.
I'm comin' home.

520
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,564
Strange place...

521
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:25,565
Tell me about it.

522
00:55:59,479 --> 00:56:02,648
Shah. You, Jennifer and
Abe follow that thing

523
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:04,525
see if you can
help that woman.

524
00:56:04,526 --> 00:56:05,818
You have the satchel charge?

525
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:10,819
That I do.

526
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:14,451
Take care of yourself.

527
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:17,120
You too.

528
00:56:17,121 --> 00:56:19,289
You two have something going?

529
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,542
It's none of your business.

530
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:26,543
Just trying to
make conversation.

531
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,750
Monsters.

532
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,419
Let's get them out
of the cages first.

533
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,420
You pitch. I'll catch.

534
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:25,188
What the hell is that?

535
00:57:25,189 --> 00:57:27,190
No idea but it can't be good.

536
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:31,320
Just great. We built our power
plants based on their technologies

537
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:34,281
now they move right in and
make anything they want.

538
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:36,575
One satchel charge in this
place is not gonna mean much.

539
00:57:36,576 --> 00:57:39,578
It will if it blows in
their control room.

540
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:44,579
Hurry.

541
00:58:01,351 --> 00:58:04,686
Those things smell like a pub
toilet on a Sunday morning.

542
00:58:04,687 --> 00:58:09,687
They probably say the
same about us. C'mon.

543
00:58:31,047 --> 00:58:34,257
We're here.

544
00:58:34,258 --> 00:58:39,258
Cap... I just... I mean...
I know I...

545
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,056
I'm sorry about
being such an ass.

546
00:58:41,057 --> 00:58:43,517
You're an irishman... you
can't help yourself.

547
00:58:43,518 --> 00:58:44,893
Just kidding.

548
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,520
I didn't know the English
had a sense of humor.

549
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:49,898
By the way... I think the
Irish should have self-rule.

550
00:58:49,899 --> 00:58:51,274
Why didn't you ever tell me?

551
00:58:51,275 --> 00:58:55,529
You never asked.

552
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:59,282
If I can get close enough, I
can lob the satchel inside.

553
00:58:59,283 --> 00:59:04,283
It's too open. You'll be seen.

554
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:08,291
It's oil... and
that's propane.

555
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:13,255
Set the charge here with
a five minute fuse.

556
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:17,426
Done... five it is.

557
00:59:17,427 --> 00:59:22,427
Let's go find the others.

558
00:59:29,856 --> 00:59:31,314
I can't.

559
00:59:31,315 --> 00:59:34,443
Don't look down.
Just watch my eyes.

560
00:59:34,444 --> 00:59:38,572
Honey, I haven't
dropped anybody yet.

561
00:59:38,573 --> 00:59:42,325
I'll count to three.
One, two...

562
00:59:42,326 --> 00:59:47,326
Abe! Behind you!

563
00:59:55,214 --> 01:00:00,214
Hey! Tall, dark and ugly.

564
01:00:01,345 --> 01:00:05,348
Jennifer!

565
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:10,349
It's not charged.

566
01:00:10,813 --> 01:00:15,813
I'll be right back.

567
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:41,468
Are you okay?

568
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:46,469
Come on, honey, I got you.
You can jump now. C'mon.

569
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:53,267
Hold tight, darlin'.

570
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,711
Get out of here! The whole
place is gonna blow.

571
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:18,421
Come on now. Up here.

572
01:01:18,422 --> 01:01:22,926
Go!

573
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:27,927
Get them out... now.

574
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:35,313
I'll cover you.

575
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:40,314
That's an order.

576
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:16,350
Come and get it.

577
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:52,390
Hot damn, kid, you did it!

578
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:53,391
Kid?

579
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:58,392
I mean you did it... sir.

580
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:02,651
Oh now we're well
and truly cooked.

581
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:07,652
It's an honor to
die with you, sir.

582
01:03:23,172 --> 01:03:26,049
Set a course for New York.
Maximum speed.

583
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,050
Yes, sir.

584
01:03:27,051 --> 01:03:28,426
Sir, you wanted to see me.

585
01:03:28,427 --> 01:03:32,013
Your team performed remarkably
well against incredible odds.

586
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:35,600
I congratulate you. There will
be the appropriate medals.

587
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:38,853
Thank you, sir. I heard the
battle for Albuquerque went well.

588
01:03:38,854 --> 01:03:42,148
We lost 40 percent of our men,
30 percent of our aircraft,

589
01:03:42,149 --> 01:03:43,733
and half of our tripods.

590
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:46,987
Whenever someone asks me if I
believe in heaven and hell...

591
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:51,988
I tell them, I don't know about
heaven, but on hell I'm an expert.

592
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:55,662
How's your crew?

593
01:03:55,663 --> 01:03:56,997
Bruised and battered.

594
01:03:56,998 --> 01:04:00,083
A few days r&r and they and
the goliath will be fine.

595
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:02,168
I wish I could give it to you.

596
01:04:02,169 --> 01:04:04,462
But... we won, sir.

597
01:04:04,463 --> 01:04:07,799
Montreal, new Orleans, new
Mexico were distractions.

598
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,261
Feints to lure the majority of
our forces out of New York.

599
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:15,223
They've surrounded Manhattan.
We've won nothing.

600
01:04:15,224 --> 01:04:20,186
Prepare your crew, captain. We
will meet our enemy in 15 hours.

601
01:04:20,187 --> 01:04:25,187
Dismissed.

602
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:47,380
When I get back to New York,
I'm going to drink five beers

603
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:49,341
and make love with three women.

604
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:54,012
No make that... ah... three
beers and five women.

605
01:04:54,013 --> 01:04:59,013
Me? I just want
to hold my girls.

606
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:03,188
How go the repairs?

607
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:07,400
Fine. A few days and the goliath
will be as good as new.

608
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:10,028
You've got 15 hours.
They hit New York.

609
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:10,779
Sir?

610
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,532
I'm sorry.

611
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:19,533
My girls...

612
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:21,915
Got a minute, captain?

613
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:22,791
Sure.

614
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:24,918
You saved us all today.

615
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,128
I was just putting one foot
in front of the other.

616
01:05:27,129 --> 01:05:28,171
I got lucky.

617
01:05:28,172 --> 01:05:30,215
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

618
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:32,217
You must be worried
about your family.

619
01:05:32,218 --> 01:05:37,218
I am. Um. My father and I,
we're not very close but...

620
01:05:41,102 --> 01:05:44,479
I'm sure he would have been
very proud of you today.

621
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,480
Thanks.

622
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:48,483
Look... I've been thinking...

623
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:50,235
This is not easy.

624
01:05:50,236 --> 01:05:52,612
Sometimes it's just
best to say it.

625
01:05:52,613 --> 01:05:57,613
Okay... here goes.

626
01:05:57,618 --> 01:06:02,497
All this... it makes me
realize what's important.

627
01:06:02,498 --> 01:06:04,541
It separates the things
you really want,

628
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:07,460
from the things you
only think you want.

629
01:06:07,461 --> 01:06:08,962
And?

630
01:06:08,963 --> 01:06:10,380
I really want you.

631
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:11,172
What?

632
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:16,173
You heard me.

633
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:20,223
You hear something?

634
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:25,224
Nope. Not a thing.

635
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:17,280
When will the cavalry
arrive, colonel?

636
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:21,367
Unknown, sir. The martians are
jamming up all radio frequencies.

637
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:23,953
All cable and telegraph
lines have been cut.

638
01:07:23,954 --> 01:07:27,749
We're in the dark, Mr.
secretary.

639
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,877
The aliens have landed
cylinders near major cities.

640
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:33,505
The invaders staged multiple
landings around Manhattan

641
01:07:33,506 --> 01:07:34,797
and central park itself.

642
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:37,509
We've lost all contact with
a.R.E.S. And militia forces.

643
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,886
In the Washington
square area, sir.

644
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:43,515
That's it then, general. Pull back
all remaining ground forces to base.

645
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:48,394
Understood, Mr. secretary. Lieutenant,
order all troops to return to base.

646
01:07:48,395 --> 01:07:50,522
It looks like we're what
they wanted all along.

647
01:07:50,523 --> 01:07:53,816
The landings up north and out west
were feints to drain our strength.

648
01:07:53,817 --> 01:07:56,277
Kill the head and the body dies.

649
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:01,278
Seal up the base. Prepare
for the assault.

650
01:08:52,835 --> 01:08:54,085
We've been breached, sir.

651
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:56,170
There's a speedboat waiting
to take you to safety.

652
01:08:56,171 --> 01:08:57,422
If you hurry, you can make it.

653
01:08:57,423 --> 01:09:01,801
No of fence, colonel. But I'm
in no mood for a boat ride.

654
01:09:01,802 --> 01:09:03,970
I understand, sir.
Your orders?

655
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:08,971
Die well.

656
01:09:17,735 --> 01:09:19,861
Good shooting, sir.

657
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:24,862
Did you think I was
just a pretty face?

658
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:33,203
Talbert! Damn.

659
01:09:52,394 --> 01:09:57,394
Bully! Bully!

660
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:05,406
Okay, boys. The
cavalry have arrived.

661
01:10:05,407 --> 01:10:10,407
Now, let's send those alien
monsters back to hell.

662
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:25,899
All units. Fire at will.

663
01:12:07,696 --> 01:12:12,696
We've retaken the base, general.
They're retreating uptown.

664
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:16,746
Excellent, Mr. secretary.

665
01:12:16,747 --> 01:12:21,747
Drive them towards us, and we'll
crush them in the middle.

666
01:13:16,557 --> 01:13:20,476
Steady... steady...
Wait for it...

667
01:13:20,477 --> 01:13:24,772
Now!

668
01:13:24,773 --> 01:13:29,773
Yeah!

669
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,920
Blow 'em to hell!

670
01:14:04,521 --> 01:14:08,024
C'mon, ya tossers! You're
meeting an irishman.

671
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:10,109
One of me's worth ten of you.

672
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:15,110
C'mon, me beauty! Yah! Yah!

673
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:31,585
Got him.

674
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:09,373
Fire!

675
01:15:31,358 --> 01:15:32,441
Captain Wells.

676
01:15:32,442 --> 01:15:34,110
Mr. secretary.

677
01:15:34,111 --> 01:15:38,906
My God, we did it, captain. Ha!
We beat the bloody monsters.

678
01:15:38,907 --> 01:15:41,158
We took back the city!

679
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:46,159
Victory! Victory! Victory!

680
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:03,889
General, I'm picking up a
large magnetic signature...

681
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:06,934
Seven Miles South by southeast
of our current position.

682
01:16:06,935 --> 01:16:11,935
Sir, there's something
emerging from the bay.

683
01:16:26,204 --> 01:16:31,204
Wha... what is that?

684
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:53,731
What in heaven's name?

685
01:16:53,732 --> 01:16:58,732
It isn't over.

686
01:17:17,047 --> 01:17:18,798
All hands to battle stations.

687
01:17:18,799 --> 01:17:21,675
A.R.E.S. Base is under
attack by an enemy air ship.

688
01:17:21,676 --> 01:17:25,054
Inform the captain of the agamemnon and
take us up to three thousand feet.

689
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:28,682
Full power to all engines.
Deploy primary weapon.

690
01:17:28,683 --> 01:17:33,683
We are going to stop them.

691
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:35,773
If you want to draw the
beast's attention...

692
01:17:35,774 --> 01:17:40,774
You must first bloody it's nose.

693
01:17:41,113 --> 01:17:46,113
Fire!

694
01:17:48,745 --> 01:17:53,745
Hit them again.

695
01:17:57,754 --> 01:18:02,754
Again!

696
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:33,910
My God... the agamemnon.

697
01:18:37,544 --> 01:18:42,544
Take us down. Four hundred feet.
Now.

698
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:49,680
Lieutenant richthofen, your weapons
will be useless against their armor.

699
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:54,681
Get your fighters out of here.

700
01:18:55,937 --> 01:18:58,689
We must get close
to the enemy.

701
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:03,690
Helmsman, maintain speed.
Steady as she goes.

702
01:19:30,055 --> 01:19:35,055
Courage, lieutenant.

703
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:23,520
Brace for impact!

704
01:20:24,192 --> 01:20:27,861
Hold on, lieutenant.

705
01:20:27,862 --> 01:20:32,862
General, you've got to take the
helm. The ship's going to break up!

706
01:20:34,494 --> 01:20:36,287
You must save the ship.

707
01:20:36,288 --> 01:20:38,998
No... do not let go!

708
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:42,626
I love you, father.

709
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:47,627
Dmitri...

710
01:21:09,904 --> 01:21:14,904
Take us up. Three
hundred feet.

711
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:33,757
All guns. Fire!

712
01:22:08,755 --> 01:22:13,755
The leviathan is down.
They died for us.

713
01:22:14,969 --> 01:22:19,969
Jasamu akan dikenang.

714
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:38,113
My friends, today we have won
the battle, but not the war.

715
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:44,915
Many of our brothers and
sisters around the globe,

716
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:49,916
and we, in our humanity, are
all brothers and sisters,

717
01:22:50,797 --> 01:22:55,797
are fighting and dying
at this moment.

718
01:22:56,386 --> 01:23:01,265
But, I swear to you in the
names of our hallowed dead...

719
01:23:01,266 --> 01:23:04,685
That we will never
forget our mission.

720
01:23:04,686 --> 01:23:09,686
We will drive these monsters from
our earth... from our home...

721
01:23:10,191 --> 01:23:12,943
And one day, take
the war to them.

722
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:16,447
Mars! Do you hear us?

723
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:21,448
Mankind is coming, and a.R.E.S.
Will lead the way.

724
01:23:21,548 --> 01:23:26,548
