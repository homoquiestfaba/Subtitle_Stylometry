Decker Sports Agency.
Please hold.

2
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:35,878
Decker Sports Agency.

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:36,814
Deano!

4
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:37,972
Good job in New York.

5
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,275
Sign 'em and dine 'em, baby!

6
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:42,455
Stevie, give me a sec.

7
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:43,580
Heading to my office now.

8
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:44,923
Hey, Rob.

9
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,549
Not now, mike.
How's the Boston deal?

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,285
Closed it.

11
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,329
Yes, love it!
Money in the bank!

12
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,524
Good morning, Rob.

13
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,723
Good morning, Mr. Decker.

14
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:55,967
Peter, hook it up in a few?

15
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:56,559
You got it, buddy.

16
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:57,261
Beautiful.

17
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:58,762
Stevie.

18
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:01,671
No, no, no, no, no.

19
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:02,469
No, no, no, no, no.

20
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,441
l did not say that.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,141
No, l would never say that.

22
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,375
Of course, l'll run it by him.
l'm his agent.

23
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,211
That's my job.

24
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,348
Well, if we don't talk tonight,

25
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,614
l'm sure you'll wake me up
tomorrow with a real offer.

26
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,023
Yeah, that's funny.

27
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,648
-What?
-Schedule.

28
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:22,292
You have a 9:00 a.m.
conference call,

29
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:25,064
lunch downstairs,
and your mother called.

30
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,096
You do remember
your mother, don't you?

31
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,131
Hold on.

32
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:31,803
Do you want to call her back?

33
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,233
Not now.

34
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,604
How old is your mother, Rob?

35
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,501
75-76, l think.

36
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,672
Well, then, by all means,
take your time getting back to her!

37
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:43,573
Claire, time is money.

38
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,048
Mom ain't makin' us money today.

39
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:46,846
Next and talk faster.

40
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:51,785
You have a haircut.

41
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:53,654
Eighth of an inch. When?

42
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:57,562
45 minutes ago, but your
midnight text told me that

43
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,929
you wanted to see Peter
first thing this morning.

44
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:00,824
l do.

45
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:02,300
l actually just saw
Peter in the hallway.

46
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:05,730
He should be walking in
right about now.

47
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:08,266
Peter!

48
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:08,898
Yeah?

49
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:09,703
How are the kids?

50
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,609
Well, they're great, thanks.

51
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:12,770
Ask me how my kids are.

52
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,276
My clients are my kids.

53
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,714
Only better.
They make me money.

54
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,418
This is the next
Decker Sports superstar.

55
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:26,520
Shawn Hart?

56
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:28,857
l don't...
l don't think he's going pro.

57
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:29,588
Why not?

58
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,989
Why not, Peter?

59
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,495
Well, he just signed
with Stetson University.

60
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,625
That's a darned good program.

61
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:35,759
No, he did not!

62
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:36,994
He did not sign!

63
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,934
He committed.

64
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:40,472
He verbally committed to Stetson.

65
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,808
He's not going pro yet, because
no one has convinced him to.

66
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,702
-l know, but what l think...
-Peter, there'd better be a way.

67
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,639
You've always been my go to guy.
You can get it done.

68
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,148
Now, l've cleared your schedule.

69
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,686
Leave today.
lt's a three hour drive.

70
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,017
Do not come home until you sign him.

71
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,280
l'm sorry. l can't.

72
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,853
There's confidence!

73
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,056
You're saying you can't sign him?

74
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,858
No, l'm saying
l can't go out of town!

75
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,557
My kid's got his first
baseball game.

76
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,358
You're kidding, right?

77
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,526
No, l'm not kidding.

78
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,532
Look, Rob, l work really hard,
and there's more to life than work.

79
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:16,432
Really?

80
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:17,938
Really.

81
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,574
Look, Rob, l've seen a lot of young guns
burn out real fast in this business.

82
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,844
They backstab each other
right out of a job,

83
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,720
and that's because the only
thing they have is their career.

84
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:31,080
Now, l've stayed at the top
of my game in this business,

85
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:34,992
because my clients know
that l value God, my family,

86
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:36,854
and l value them.

87
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,829
Rob, there's some things
you just don't get back in life,

88
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:42,726
and l'm not missing
my kid's ball game.

89
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,866
There are definitely things in life
you don't get back, like your job.

90
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:50,741
Are you firing me?

91
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,010
-You're firing me?
-He's not firing anybody.

92
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:55,311
Get on out of here.

93
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,885
Rob Decker, you and l
need to have a talk.

94
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:00,948
About what?

95
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,848
About Shawn Hart.

96
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,252
You go sign the kid.

97
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,088
Yeah, you.

98
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,229
lt's been a while since
you've been out in the real world.

99
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,298
Let's see if you've still got it.

100
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,165
And you might think about
your priorities along the way.

101
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,133
My priorities?

102
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,172
Yes, your priorities.

103
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,501
lf you'd just stop long
enough to notice,

104
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,737
you'd realize that Peter is right.

105
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:27,176
Oh, Peter has gotten old and soft.

106
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,579
You are 35 years old, Rob.

107
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:31,879
Take a look around, honey.

108
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,842
There's a lot more
to life than this.

109
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,655
You know what,
Claire, darling?

110
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:43,896
l think l will go sign
this kid myself,

111
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:48,498
because this is my life,
and l don't need more than this.

112
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:25,294
In your Iight is where
I'II find who I am

113
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:28,537
No more sadness

114
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,574
No more running from your pIan

115
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,712
AII I need is your sweet Iove

116
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,013
'Cause you cIeanse me deep within

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,153
AII I ever want is you

118
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:47,987
'Cause you are mine,
and I am yours

119
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:53,593
Your Iove is aII I couId
ever hope for

120
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,232
Just one touch

121
00:05:55,335 --> 00:06:00,432
And I wiII never be the same

122
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:04,573
Never be the same again

123
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:19,389
Onstar, how far
is the nearest gas station?

124
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,793
OnIy one gas station
in the immediate area.

125
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,629
PhiI's gas station,
ten miIes ahead.

126
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:28,559
Great.

127
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:36,065
Your Iove is aII
I couId ever hope for

128
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:42,779
Just one touch, and I
wiII never be the same

129
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,184
Never be the same again

130
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,651
Turn right on Junk Yard Road.

131
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:15,812
Hey!

132
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,374
Hey!
Do you fix cars?

133
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,353
Sorry?

134
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,822
-Do you fix cars?
-No.

135
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,190
You don't fix cars here?

136
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,327
Well, l can't say that l do.

137
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:35,932
Well, does he?

138
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,396
No, he definitely
don't fix cars,

139
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,197
but he plays a mean flattop.

140
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,275
l'm just looking at all the signs.

141
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,974
Does anyone here fix cars?

142
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:50,145
Phil!

143
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,284
We drummed up some
business for you.

144
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,393
Can you fix my car?

145
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:10,469
What's wrong with it?

146
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:11,997
Well, it's smoking.

147
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:14,871
Let's see.

148
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,137
The engine in these is in the rear.

149
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:24,248
Don't worry. Once he finds
the engine, he can usually fix it.

150
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,252
Can you leave it with me?

151
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:28,985
lt's smoking.

152
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,754
l have to leave it with you.

153
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:33,956
Which way to town?

154
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:36,792
Can l rent a car?

155
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:39,897
You don't need one.

156
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,191
You just walk 15 minutes
in either direction,

157
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:43,962
and, well, you're out of town.

158
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,585
Good afternoon.

159
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,686
l'm Steve.

160
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,090
l'm the pastor here at the church.

161
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:41,956
Rob Decker.

162
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,260
Hey, Rob Decker,
nice to meet you.

163
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,998
So, are you lost or hungry?

164
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,903
Well, a little of both, l think.
l could smell it a mile away.

165
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,765
Well, you've definitely
come to the right place.

166
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,275
Welcome to Middletown.
This is small town USA.

167
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,242
We are complete
with your hot dogs,

168
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:01,712
your apple pie, and we're
known best for our baseball.

169
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:02,937
Oh, that's what l've heard.

170
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,247
l also hear you've got quite
the ballplayer in Shawn Hart.

171
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:10,721
Oh, yeah, Shawn is a great player,
but even more, he's a great young man.

172
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,655
We're really proud of
him here in Middletown.

173
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:14,523
He's heading off to
Stetson University.

174
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:16,027
He's going to play for Pete Dunn.

175
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,258
ls that so?

176
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,101
Come on, right on,
can't do it again, baby!

177
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,275
Come on, Shawn, do it again!

178
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,719
Best pitcher of all time, Nolan Ryan.

179
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:44,348
Not a chance!

180
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,420
Greg Maddux, the professor.

181
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,750
He could put the ball
anywhere he wanted.

182
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:52,996
The Ryan Express threw faster than
anyone, seven no hitters.

183
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,666
Mad Dog, four straight CY Young's,

184
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:59,135
18 gold gloves,
plus he was cute.

185
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:01,500
Coffee, Mr. Johnson?

186
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,640
ls it decaf?

187
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:03,672
This is decaf.

188
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,271
l have to have decaf.

189
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,540
l can't take that regular stuff.

190
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,812
l only put decaf in the orange pot.

191
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,812
You know,
l went into the city once,

192
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:15,980
and a guy told me, he said that
in the orange pot was hazelnut.

193
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,120
Hazelnut?

194
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,657
Well, l don't make hazelnut coffee
here, Mr. Johnson.

195
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,786
l only put decaf in the orange pot.

196
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,887
- l'll take decaf.
-All right.

197
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:27,864
What's good around here?

198
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,830
Fried chicken, potato salad,
you name it.

199
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:32,835
lt's all good.

200
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,529
Daisy's being modest.

201
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,775
The best thing around
here are the pies.

202
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,969
She makes the best pies around.

203
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,843
We have apple or lemon.

204
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:42,979
Tough choice.

205
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:47,583
Well, like l say, when you have a choice
like that, take one of each.

206
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,884
Some offers in life,
you just can't refuse.

207
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:00,327
Come on, dragon!

208
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,740
No more, you're done.

209
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:12,977
Give the ball to anyone else.

210
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,544
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,280
That's not still in the deal.

212
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,377
Stop right there!

213
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:55,682
Freeze!

214
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:06,989
Okay, now l'm ready.

215
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:12,538
My name is Maggie.

216
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,203
-Can l help you?
-Checking in.

217
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:15,368
What's the name?

218
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:16,736
Decker, Rob Decker.

219
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,672
-And you have a reservation?
-Yes.

220
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,340
-Could it be under a different name?
-No.

221
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,744
And you're sure you called
and made a reservation?

222
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:26,717
No, my assistant did.

223
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,485
Oh, you have an assistant?

224
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,779
That is quite impressive.

225
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:36,328
Well, it looks like we don't have
a reservation under that name.

226
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:37,958
Just get me a room then.

227
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:39,225
Say please.

228
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:43,995
Please.

229
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,970
Oh, l'm so sorry.

230
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,405
lt looks like we're sold out.

231
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:50,367
Sold out?

232
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:53,539
There's not another soul around.

233
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,608
l'm sorry.

234
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,341
We don't have anymore rooms.

235
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,040
l'm sure my assistant
made a reservation.

236
00:13:59,018 --> 00:13:59,643
Can l use your phone?

237
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:01,553
-ls it a local call?
-No.

238
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,422
Unfortunately, it does not
dial long distance.

239
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:05,815
That is ridiculous.

240
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,517
Look, l have to have a room!

241
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:10,220
How about this?

242
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:19,663
How about now?

243
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,274
Oh, this is just too funny!

244
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,445
She said you were going
to try to do this!

245
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:27,977
Who's she?

246
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:28,776
And try what?

247
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:30,877
Claire, your assistant.

248
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:32,709
Claire.

249
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,720
And she said that first you were
going to try to bribe me,

250
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:36,686
and also to look out,

251
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,781
because you might
try to throw your phone.

252
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:40,525
Claire, Claire.

253
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:41,987
You talked to Claire?

254
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:43,662
l really like her.

255
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,162
She is such a hoot.

256
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:47,392
She helped me plan out
this whole scheme

257
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,923
when she called and checked
you in this morning.

258
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:49,567
Really?

259
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,527
She is such a hoot!

260
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,467
What on earth is that?

261
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:54,705
That's a high five.

262
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,335
Well, l know what it is.

263
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,037
l just didn't think
anyone did it anymore.

264
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:00,637
Here.

265
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:07,044
Oh, you don't know.

266
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,552
Okay, l'm gonna teach you.

267
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:14,821
One, two, flames,
then you pound it, explosion!

268
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:16,358
But you have to make
the sound effects, like...

269
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,432
it's the Middletown meltdown.

270
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:23,696
Everyone knows it,
so l would start practicing.

271
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:25,762
Where's my room?

272
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:29,003
lf you go right up these stairs,
it's the first one on the left.

273
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:31,935
Thank you.

274
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,141
This is quite a town.

275
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:35,772
Quite a town.

276
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,609
See you tomorrow, Mr. Decker!

277
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,043
Oh, l can't wait.

278
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:51,257
Seriously?

279
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,210
Good morning, Mr. Decker!

280
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,313
Good morning, Maggie!

281
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:11,214
lt is, isn't it?

282
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:14,483
Do you rollerblade?

283
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:15,886
No.

284
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:19,954
Where's the high school?

285
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,055
Well, you're really dressed up
to be going to high school.

286
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,422
ls Kermit going to the prom?

287
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,866
Maggie, l'm going to the high school
baseball practice.

288
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,736
Well, it's just straight
down the road that way.

289
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,137
Oh, and you're going to
want to look for

290
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,470
the really big sign that
says high school.

291
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:37,331
Right.

292
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:38,436
Thanks, Maggie.

293
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,975
Oh, and don't forget
to practice the handshake.

294
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,742
Everyone in town knows it!

295
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,062
Try page 122.

296
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,397
122.

297
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,296
That's it, that's it.

298
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,366
Now go to table C.

299
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:14,573
Man, there's a lot
to these things.

300
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:18,645
You've got to be kidding me.

301
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:28,552
That's the one.

302
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:48,441
Shawn Hart!

303
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,312
l'm Rob Decker.

304
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:51,741
l don't want to bug you
at practice, man.

305
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,182
Can l steal five minutes
of your time?

306
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:54,610
l'm a straight shooter, Shawn.

307
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,619
l just want to let you know that
l know the best when l see it.

308
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:00,249
You are it!

309
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:03,519
You are the best;
and lucky for you, so am l.

310
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:04,590
You an agent?

311
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,227
l'm not just any agent.

312
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:09,224
l'm the best of the best,
and l only represent the best.

313
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:10,966
You don't know who l am?

314
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:12,167
No, sir.

315
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:13,763
Well, you do now!

316
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,267
Check out my website,
deckersportsgroup.com.

317
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,032
We're also on Facebook and Twitter.

318
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,439
Got lots of friends and followers.

319
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:21,808
Hey, who's this?

320
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,081
What's your name, little man?

321
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,849
So, Shawn, l believe this is yours.

322
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,550
Thank you, but l can't take that.

323
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,758
Don't take it.
Catch it, man.

324
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,693
Good hands!

325
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,092
Big league quick hands,

326
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:37,891
hands like that,
first round draft pick.

327
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,396
l'm talking millions of dollars
just in the signing bonus.

328
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,165
This isn't mine, sir.

329
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,399
Of course, it is.
lt has your name on it.

330
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,531
Possession is nine tenths of the law.

331
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,462
Not NCAA law.

332
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,135
l can't accept gifts from agents.
lt would make me ineligible.

333
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:51,939
Here.

334
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:54,171
l already told Stetson
l'd accept their scholarship offer.

335
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:55,843
How about you, little man?

336
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:56,879
You committed?

337
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,012
Stetson?

338
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,047
You told them, right?
On the phone?

339
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:04,681
Yes, sir.

340
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:06,857
So, you haven't signed
your official letter of intent yet.

341
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,391
Same thing.

342
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:11,028
No, no, far from
the same thing, actually.

343
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,762
Mr. Decker,
it was nice to meet you.

344
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,600
Me and PJ gotta be
getting home.

345
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,828
Okay, sure.

346
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:20,562
l'll catch you guys later.

347
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,166
Get some rest.

348
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,110
Coach walker!

349
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,283
Rob Decker.

350
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,180
Man, it is a pleasure to
finally meet you.

351
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:38,151
-Sit down and have a talk?
-Yeah.

352
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,120
Now, l know a lot of agents
came through here,

353
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,252
but l want to
start fresh, blank slate.

354
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:46,493
Blank as...

355
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:51,332
as this envelope.

356
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:54,532
That's for you.

357
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,139
A little something from all of us
from Decker Sports Group.

358
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,243
You know who we are, right?

359
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,313
Oh, absolutely.

360
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:04,282
Who hasn't heard of Rob Decker
and Decker Sports Group?

361
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,509
Apparently, Shawn Hart.

362
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,477
You do know what l'm
talking about, right?

363
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,118
You know where l'm coming
from and what l want.

364
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,085
Yeah, you want to
represent Shawn Hart.

365
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,023
That's right.

366
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,327
He should not be going to college.

367
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,491
He should be going
straight to the pros.

368
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,163
Can you help me?

369
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,199
l can't take this, man.

370
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:34,706
l love what l do.

371
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:36,775
l love these kids.
l don't do it for the money.

372
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,439
Hey, l didn't mean it
like you think.

373
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,746
l just thought this,
this might help you out, maybe.

374
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,288
Yeah, Rob, l've got
everything l need, man.

375
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,852
Seems to me you might be the one
that needs a little help here.

376
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,588
Will you help me?

377
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,290
Well, look, l mean,
l can see both sides.

378
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,457
l coached the kid for four years.
l know he can do it all.

379
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,099
Personally, l don't think
you've got a shot;

380
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,236
but if you want to go for it,

381
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,636
he lives right down the road
at Cooke boys ranch.

382
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,669
l suggest you talk to
Miss Cooke first.

383
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:06,474
-Thanks, coach.
-You got it.

384
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,222
Excuse me.

385
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,059
ls this the Cooke boys ranch?

386
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:30,798
This is it.

387
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:33,595
Hi.

388
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,101
Hello.

389
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,171
Daisy, right?

390
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:39,602
That's right.

391
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:41,174
Rob Decker.

392
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,139
We met at the spring festival.

393
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,280
Yes, we did.

394
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,281
Can l help you?

395
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:49,943
Yes, l'm looking
for someone, Shawn Hart.

396
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,082
He one of the boys here
at the ranch?

397
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:53,851
Shawn lives here.

398
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:54,888
Great.

399
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,654
Could you tell me where
l could find Miss Cooke?

400
00:21:58,931 --> 00:21:59,795
Well, that would be me.

401
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,424
You?

402
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,566
Oh, wow.

403
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,630
This is my lucky day.

404
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,666
Oh, well, l'm flattered,
Mr. Decker,

405
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:11,039
but you might not want
to get too excited.

406
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,407
l might not be telling
you what you want to hear.

407
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:14,671
Oh, l don't know about that.

408
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:16,772
l'm pretty easy to please.

409
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,813
-ls that a fact?
-Yes, ma'am.

410
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,848
How do you know what
l want to hear, anyway?

411
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:24,880
Everyone knows
why you're in town.

412
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,759
Well, hear me out
before you shut me down.

413
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,552
Can you do that for me?

414
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:34,958
l'm just a poor, dumb city boy
trying to survive in this cold,

415
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,231
cold world.

416
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,263
Just a lost boy with a Benz.

417
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:40,165
This is gonna be good.

418
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,538
l like your style, Daisy.

419
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:44,966
l'm here to do what l do best.

420
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:49,012
l'm an agent,
the best sports agent,

421
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:52,039
according to some.
Most, actually.

422
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,519
l'm here to bring good news,
to bring riches.

423
00:22:57,623 --> 00:23:01,354
Do you realize what a five million
dollar signing bonus is?

424
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,258
What could be done right here
with his instant wealth?

425
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,893
The boys could have
lphones, lpads, ltouches.

426
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,299
Well, l, l, l...

427
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,466
You're kind of like Superman.

428
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,567
-Come on.
-You here to save the day?

429
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,110
l'm just here to make sure
you consider all the options.

430
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:21,670
l think we have.

431
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,649
Shawn has a lot of
gifts beyond baseball.

432
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:33,415
Do you know that
he's got a 4.0 GPA?

433
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:35,726
He's the senior class president.

434
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:38,093
He writes incredible poetry.

435
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,257
He even competed
in a state math competition.

436
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:48,567
You know, baseball will end someday,
but a college education,

437
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,707
that'll be with him for
the rest of his life.

438
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,671
Poetry, really?

439
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:56,176
Yeah.

440
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,049
Hey, l know it's a tough choice.

441
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,186
Life is all about choices, Rob.

442
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,683
Shawn's thought this decision
through thoroughly.

443
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:09,389
He's researched it.

444
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:11,588
He's asked the right
people the right questions.

445
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:17,560
And this might not mean much to you,
but he's prayed about it a lot.

446
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,698
Do you ever pray, Mr. Decker?

447
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:25,472
l can do that, yes.

448
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:28,603
And l will, but first l just
want to make sure...

449
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,716
Mr. Decker,
when you're in a hole...

450
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,311
Yeah, l know, stop digging.

451
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,783
No, look up and pray.

452
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:42,891
And Mr. Decker, try and let God
do some of the talking.

453
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,425
l feel like you
might've won round one.

454
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,163
But l've still got
a little gas left in the tank.

455
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:53,404
Oh, how ironic
for a man without a car.

456
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:57,236
Joey!

457
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,276
lt's a tradition.

458
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:01,576
What does it mean?

459
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:06,415
l'm not sure right now is the right time,
but this is a big deal.

460
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:10,746
l'll talk to you another time.

461
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,105
Mr. Decker!

462
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:27,934
Hi, Maggie.

463
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,201
Well, you haven't given up,
have you?

464
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:32,134
You know, the handshake.

465
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,508
Flames...

466
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:39,241
Good job!

467
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:41,844
You almost have it.
Very impressive.

468
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,716
Thank you, Maggie.

469
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:44,817
ls that mink?

470
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:47,187
Pink.

471
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:52,260
Good night!

472
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:02,497
Claire, it's me.

473
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:03,370
Any calls?

474
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,474
Yeah, but I've
got everything covered

475
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,205
untiI you get back from
your mission.

476
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:08,772
What's it Iike there?

477
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,573
Well, it's kind of like Mayberry,

478
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:15,053
except Andy's a professor, and
Goober and Gomer are Mac and Phil.

479
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,985
WeII, how's the hunt
for Mr. October?

480
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,187
Very funny.

481
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:20,684
You sign him yet?

482
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:25,458
Claire, this...
it's a tough one.

483
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,263
Come on, you've seen it aII.

484
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:33,234
There is something going on here that
l have never had to deal with before.

485
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,536
And Claire, they asked me to pray.

486
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,067
You shouId pray.

487
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:39,741
Thank you, Lord.

488
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,642
They sound Iike my kind of peopIe.

489
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,087
Good morning, Mr. Decker!

490
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:53,022
Yes, it is!

491
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,485
Well, let's see it.

492
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,031
Wow, you've got it!

493
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,065
Was there ever a doubt?

494
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,669
l think you're ready
to try it on your own!

495
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,955
You know, l can see you, Fes.

496
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:27,817
You're reflected in his eyeglasses.

497
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,691
Willie, you've been watching
way too much Texas hold 'em.

498
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,897
Your move, Phil lvy.

499
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:40,963
Let's see, 16 down.

500
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,937
How many letters?

501
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:43,236
Oh, five.

502
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,372
Five letters.

503
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:45,433
Across or down?

504
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:47,944
Are you gonna help me now?

505
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,104
Across or down?

506
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,847
Down, and it ends in Y.

507
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:57,182
Hello, there.

508
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:58,286
Hello there, Beck.

509
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:05,963
l need a haircut.

510
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:07,893
We can do that right here.

511
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:13,232
Trim, clean it up,
neck right around the ears,

512
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:17,041
take up the sideburns
an eighth of an inch, just an eighth.

513
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,477
l get a trim every
Tuesday and Friday.

514
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,769
Nice.

515
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,781
Maybe you ought to take a trim
to that car of yours.

516
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:29,776
How do you know about my car?

517
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:31,556
Small town.

518
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:36,253
You know, the word travels fast
and a lot faster than your car.

519
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,329
How is my car coming, Fes?

520
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,659
Oh, Phil and Mac
are making some progress.

521
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:44,698
How about yourself?

522
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:46,301
Oh, l'm making progress.

523
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:49,372
l went up to the boys ranch,
talked with daisy.

524
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:56,745
Now, that Daisy, she's pretty
protective of those boys out there.

525
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,380
You're lucky you came
back with your skin on.

526
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,513
She was actually cordial.

527
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:04,287
l'll tell you what, man.

528
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,323
The boys ranch is a special place.

529
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:08,717
The Cookes out there
give them boys hope

530
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:12,428
and, man, that's something they don't
get a lot of, especially Shawn.

531
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:17,534
Hey, have you ever seen
Shawn play in a game in person,

532
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,067
or is tonight going to be
your first time?

533
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:20,261
What's tonight?

534
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,902
Tonight, the alumni game.

535
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,874
The whole town is going to be there.

536
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:26,001
Will Daisy be there?

537
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:27,508
Oh, yeah, she'll be there.

538
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:29,839
Well, then, l'll be there, too.

539
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,114
Well, you're either
very brave or very stupid.

540
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,809
He is no fool.

541
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,544
Hey, Rob.

542
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:03,607
What's that about?

543
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,283
Well, you know us preachers.

544
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:10,152
We're always looking for the catchy phrase
to get people's attention;

545
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:15,121
but, actually, this comes from
a quote from a guy named Jim Eliot,

546
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,288
and he was a missionary
back in the 1950's.

547
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:22,823
He went with four other guys
to the remote jungles of Ecuador

548
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:28,735
to try to take the message of God's love
to a very dangerous tribe of natives.

549
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,841
All of his friends, of course,
thought he was crazy

550
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,041
for going to such a dangerous place.

551
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:37,712
He was a young guy, bright,
had a great future ahead of him.

552
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,777
ln fact, he was a great athlete,
as a matter of fact.

553
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:45,489
As the story unfolds, he and the four
missionaries with him were,

554
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:47,458
in fact, all attacked and killed

555
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:50,120
by the very people that
they were trying to help.

556
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:54,625
So, it looked like a pretty tragic
end to that story,

557
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:59,802
but then amazing and pretty
miraculous things started to happen,

558
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:03,170
as a result of those five
men's deaths.

559
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:07,305
Many of the people in that
tribe actually became believers

560
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,371
and followers of God,
and some of the very men

561
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:13,612
that killed those missionaries
became missionaries themselves,

562
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:15,778
if you can believe that,
and the whole tribe

563
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:19,119
really became a very
peaceful and kind people.

564
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:20,552
So, how do they explain that?

565
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:21,885
Well, that's a great question.

566
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,487
Even the anthropologists that
had studied this tribe for years

567
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,758
couldn't believe it
and couldn't explain it.

568
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,695
So, anyway, after he died, this quote
was found in Jim Eliot's journals,

569
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,467
where he had written these words:

570
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:41,503
''He is no fool who gives what he cannot
keep to gain that which he cannot lose.''

571
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:44,678
So, he is no fool.

572
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,878
Well, l guess there's more than
one way to define foolishness.

573
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:53,719
l actually have been feeling a little
foolish ever since l got to town.

574
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,762
You know, you and everyone else
knows why l'm here,

575
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,792
but l'm actually not a bad guy.

576
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:08,202
l feel l really do know what's best
for Shawn, but l'm getting nowhere.

577
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:17,046
l guess l just need to spend some more
time with Daisy and get close to Shawn.

578
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:21,847
Well, Mr. Decker, l don't think
you're a bad guy at all;

579
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,820
and, in fact, l think
it'd be a great idea for you

580
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,450
to spend some time
with Daisy and with the boys.

581
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:30,593
And here's an idea.
You should go to the game tonight.

582
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:31,993
Everybody's going to be there,

583
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,360
and you need to come
to the concert tomorrow night.

584
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,659
What concert?

585
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:41,002
Oh, yeah, big concert going on
at the Athens theater, a very cool band.

586
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:42,399
l think you might like it.

587
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:46,138
And, l bet you Daisy
and the guys will be there, also.

588
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:49,807
Pastor, thank you so much.

589
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:51,471
All right, Rob.
See you later.

590
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:54,211
Strike three!

591
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:06,990
Strike three!

592
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,936
Hey, buddy, scoot over.

593
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:17,635
Can l sit here?

594
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:19,573
lt looks you are sitting here.

595
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,917
Hey, mister, you want
to buy a raffle ticket?

596
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,553
-No, thanks.
-Come on!

597
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,094
-How much?
-One dollar.

598
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:38,227
You can win a pie.

599
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:40,291
-Win a pie.
-Two pies.

600
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:41,688
You're kidding, right?

601
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,028
Do l look like l'm kidding?

602
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,499
Last chance to buy tickets
for tonight's raffIe.

603
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:50,137
The winning ticket can get two pies
from the kitchen of Daisy Cooke.

604
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:52,135
Kid, kid, kid,
how many you got there?

605
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:53,841
l don't know, about 50.

606
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:54,568
50.

607
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:58,274
Give me all of them.

608
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,111
Strike three!

609
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:06,918
And that's strikeout number six for
our aIumni team hometown heroes.

610
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:12,025
Strike!

611
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:35,850
Strike!

612
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,981
This is unbelievable.

613
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,324
Well, you can't stop him.

614
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,618
Just try to contain him.

615
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:53,200
Strike three!

616
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,432
Hey, officer, how fast was that?

617
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:00,644
92 mile an hour curve ball.

618
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,256
Strike three!

619
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:15,655
Who is this guy?

620
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:16,990
He's throwing bb's.

621
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,168
Strike!

622
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,449
This guy is really in a slump.

623
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,553
He hasn't had a hit in three weeks.

624
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:45,588
Let's give him one.

625
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:48,586
All right, squat.

626
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:50,986
Tell him l'm gonna groove
this one right down the middle.

627
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:51,685
Do it.

628
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:52,696
-Here we go, boys.
-Right on.

629
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:05,765
Swing level, big fella.

630
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,072
Coming right down the middle for you.

631
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:28,289
Who is he?

632
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,658
He's Scooter.

633
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:31,495
Scooter?
That's his name?

634
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:32,433
Yeah, Scooter.

635
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:33,860
Well, does he have a last name?

636
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:36,672
And here are the winning numbers
for tonight's raffIe.

637
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,900
The winner gets two homemade pies.

638
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,813
And the winning ticket
is 9-1-2-1-3.

639
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:44,978
Hey, psst.

640
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:46,650
Check your ticket.

641
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:49,952
Who has ticket 9-1-2-1-3?

642
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:51,746
That's me!

643
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,491
We do have a winner here.

644
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:56,425
This is your lucky night.

645
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,826
Ooh, you have no idea.

646
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:01,855
Claire?

647
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,889
HeIIo, Rob.

648
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:03,626
Listen to me.

649
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:04,793
Drop everything.

650
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,030
Drop everything for what?

651
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,630
l need you to call some of my guys
and tell them l might need a favor.

652
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:10,133
What kind of a favor?

653
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,004
lt's just a hunch.

654
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,734
What is going on out there?

655
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:14,540
lf l told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

656
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,614
WeII, I can caII the big three.

657
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,548
l'll call you tomorrow, and l'll
tell you possibly when and where.

658
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:19,207
Okay.

659
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:20,178
Good night, boss.

660
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,483
HeIIo.

661
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:32,857
ls this Steve Wales, general manager
of the best team in baseball?

662
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:33,988
Rob Decker.

663
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:35,395
Get off the treadmill, my friend,

664
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,093
'cause you're gonna need
to sit down for this one.

665
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:39,460
You're gonna feel like it's Christmas
morning when this one's done.

666
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:40,761
Rob, l'm working here.

667
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:43,363
Stevie, look, l want to let
you know l called you first.

668
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:44,031
But l'm not gonna lie.

669
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,009
As soon as l hang up, l'm calling
the rest of the league.

670
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:48,277
Now, what do you need
more than anything else?

671
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:50,044
Pitching, right?
An ace?

672
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,913
Who doesn't?
Especially you.

673
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,913
And not just a number one starter.

674
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:55,976
l'm talking a strikeout pitcher.

675
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:57,587
Yeah, what am l
gonna have to give up?

676
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:58,879
Nothing, it's not a trade.

677
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:00,016
Who is he?

678
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,150
Free agent.

679
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:02,453
Is he in a Ieague?

680
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,825
Unsigned, an unsigned gold mine.

681
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,659
Look, if it's that kid from Cuba,
l've already seen him.

682
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:09,359
He's American,
and you haven't seen him,

683
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,925
l guarantee it, 'cause if you did,
he'd be playing for you.

684
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,501
Where'd he play
his college ball?

685
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:14,297
He didn't.

686
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:15,304
What is he, in jaiI?

687
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:17,067
Steve, trust me.

688
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,200
You'll want him.

689
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:19,834
His fast ball jumps like the wind.

690
00:38:19,944 --> 00:38:22,208
His curve ball, whoosh,
falls off the table.

691
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:23,612
So, what do you want?

692
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:24,740
How much is it gonna cost me?

693
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:26,306
l want you to work him out,
a tryout.

694
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:29,714
Okay, bring him to California.

695
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:31,455
How soon?

696
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,184
Let's make it the
middle of the week.

697
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,155
We're Iooking at a catcher from Jersey,
and they can work out together.

698
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:37,885
Can you get him here by then?

699
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,019
l'm Rob Decker.

700
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:41,053
l can do anything.

701
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:44,830
And, Steve, l guarantee you'll make him
an offer before he hits the showers.

702
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,530
Rob Decker, have you even
signed this guy yet?

703
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,668
Steve, come on,

704
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,302
that's the easy part,
all in a day's work.

705
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,055
Fellas, this looks like
a good sign.

706
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,884
Guessing my car is done.

707
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:15,293
Nope, but we're making progress.

708
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:20,226
Hey, were you at the
alumni game last night?

709
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:25,440
No, we were here
working on your car.

710
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:27,740
What's the dog's name?

711
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,974
Pedro.

712
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:31,243
Pedro?

713
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:35,009
Okay, l'll check back later.

714
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,294
Fellas, fellas, fellas!

715
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:48,361
What you need, another
eighth inch cut off of there?

716
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:51,360
That's good, there you go.

717
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,767
l am talking miles,
miles per hour.

718
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:02,345
So, tell me about Scooter.
What's the deal?

719
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,506
What do you want to know?

720
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:06,207
What do l want to know?

721
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,547
l want to know everything.

722
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:08,980
Where does he live?

723
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,351
What's he do?
How old is he?

724
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:13,085
And that can't be his real name.

725
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,725
How does someone get
a name like Scooter?

726
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,791
lf you think he can throw,
you ought to see him run.

727
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:25,932
So, what's his real name?

728
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:33,076
Danny...
Danny Cooke.

729
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:34,473
Danny Cooke.

730
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:43,883
That's Danny Cooke?

731
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:49,458
The Danny Cooke?

732
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:56,098
Man, we were hearing
about him when he was 16,

733
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:58,329
and then he just disappeared.

734
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,398
That had to be about
ten years ago.

735
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,136
Do you know where l can find him?

736
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:14,179
Not a half day, Mr. Decker?

737
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:15,276
Just getting started.

738
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:34,570
Maggie.

739
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,470
What are you doing?

740
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:39,338
Practicing going to the beach!

741
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:41,577
You're wearing pants.

742
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:43,407
And?

743
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:45,973
You're amazing, Maggie!

744
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:00,327
Good game last night.

745
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:02,760
lt's kind of like our first date.

746
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:05,627
l wish l would have known.

747
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:07,402
You could've at least
bought a girl a hot dog.

748
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:13,167
l see you're still on foot.

749
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,140
Taking this what would
Jesus do thing seriously?

750
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:18,479
l have no idea what
you're talking about.

751
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,244
Get it?

752
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:21,381
He walked everywhere?

753
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,186
That's you being funny.

754
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:26,712
Ouch.

755
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,425
lt is amazing how much thinking
you can do while you're walking.

756
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,624
l'm starting to notice things
all around this little town

757
00:42:33,664 --> 00:42:34,892
l might've missed otherwise.

758
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:39,531
Wow, big city sports agent
being wooed by our little town?

759
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:41,562
Now l've seen everything.

760
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,731
Thinking of giving up
the Benz for good?

761
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:46,910
Oh, l have no idea
what's going on with my car.

762
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:48,336
Phil and Mac...

763
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,175
Ah, Phil and Mac,
they can fix anything.

764
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,076
Well, Phil can.

765
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:58,178
But if you say Phil can get it done,
that's good to know.

766
00:42:58,856 --> 00:42:59,880
l do need to get back at some point.

767
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:00,913
l can't stay here forever.

768
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:03,559
Would that be so bad?

769
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:06,789
l'm just a fast-paced guy.

770
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:08,996
l love the excitement of
the big city,

771
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,897
energy, the bright lights.

772
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:17,604
But l do admit, there are some things
l've become quite fond of here.

773
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:20,744
Heads up!

774
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:24,271
Speaking of baseball...

775
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:28,641
l've never seen anything
like last night.

776
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:32,112
That pitcher for
the alumni team, Scooter...

777
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:35,222
interesting.

778
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:38,161
l'll be honest.

779
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:40,359
l did some homework this
morning at the barber shop,

780
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,922
which is the hub
of all local information.

781
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:47,367
They told me Scooter's
real name is Danny Cooke

782
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:49,436
and that he lives here
on Cooke ranch.

783
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:52,276
You're Daisy Cooke.

784
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,001
l said Daisy Cooke,
Danny Cooke.

785
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,137
Obviously, they're married.

786
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:58,510
The boys got quite
a chuckle out of that.

787
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:00,143
They didn't let me know otherwise.

788
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:02,151
Well, Mr. obvious,
Scooter is my brother.

789
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,213
lt's a good thing you're an agent
and not a detective.

790
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:08,218
Your brother is really good.

791
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,154
He might actually be the best
l've ever seen.

792
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:13,762
And l bet you want
to talk to him, don't you?

793
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:15,562
You okay with that?

794
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:17,463
Absolutely.

795
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:20,862
ln fact, take as much
time as you like.

796
00:44:21,872 --> 00:44:22,998
l'm going to enjoy this.

797
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:27,205
Get out of here.

798
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:30,345
Scooter, this is Mr. Decker.

799
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:32,842
He thinks you're the best ever.

800
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:34,818
Please, call me Rob.

801
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:38,678
Nice.

802
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,516
l see someone's met Maggie.

803
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:42,158
Well, not bad, Rob.

804
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:44,317
Hey, y'all run along.

805
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:46,192
l'm going to talk to Mr. Decker
real quick, all right?

806
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,764
Please allow me to formally
introduce myself.

807
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:52,167
l am Rob Decker.

808
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:54,097
l'm from Decker Sports Group.

809
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:56,832
We represent the top athletes
in all professional sports.

810
00:44:57,641 --> 00:45:00,235
Now, of course, l'm proud to say this,
because the agency is actually mine.

811
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:03,211
l founded it, l'm president,
and l'm CEO.

812
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:05,713
Congrats on that.

813
00:45:06,684 --> 00:45:08,481
Yeah, word spreads
pretty fast in this town.

814
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,283
l heard you were looking
for Shawn, right?

815
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:11,445
Yes, that's right.

816
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,454
l came here to sign Shawn Hart.

817
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:17,220
No, he's going
to college, Stetson.

818
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,390
l heard he was
interested in college.

819
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:21,659
He wants to be a doctor.

820
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,732
Can you imagine that?

821
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:26,360
He's a great shortstop.

822
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:28,068
He's even a better kid.

823
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:30,931
l'll be honest.

824
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:33,643
l think he's a first round draft
pick right out of high school,

825
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:35,906
millions of dollars just
in a signing bonus.

826
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,904
Now, l know you don't think
you're the first agent

827
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:40,075
that's come around here
offering big money, right?

828
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:42,881
No, no, of course not,
but l just want to point out...

829
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:45,350
Listen, Mr. Decker...

830
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:47,483
Look, l just want to
save you some time.

831
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:55,322
l know the sound of a huge signing
bonus and a nice car, a big house.

832
00:45:56,434 --> 00:46:00,200
Now that's going to turn the head
of any young teenage American boy,

833
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:02,370
but that is not Shawn.

834
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:05,504
He knows God's got a path for him.

835
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:10,808
Now, maybe that path is
paved in dollar bills or not.

836
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:14,408
l don't know,
but he knows where it leads,

837
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,253
and God knows
where Shawn is going.

838
00:46:19,156 --> 00:46:21,624
And with all due respect,
Mr. Decker,

839
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:24,421
l don't think you know
where that boy's been.

840
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:27,793
Okay, what do l need to know?

841
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:35,568
That young man you're looking at,
not the same boy that showed up here.

842
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:40,937
He was ten years old, harder than
any kid ought to be at that age.

843
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,740
He was angry, broken.

844
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:50,750
Dad left him the day he was born.

845
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:52,721
His mom had her troubles.

846
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:56,419
Yeah, he probably doesn't have
a memory of her coming around sober.

847
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:00,297
So, by the time she was
killed in that car wreck,

848
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:03,329
the kid was far too used to having
to take care of himself.

849
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:06,497
l'm sorry.

850
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:10,838
Yeah, he hated those words.

851
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,237
Tired of hearing l'm sorry
for this and that.

852
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:18,681
Couldn't hardly say them himself.

853
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:22,308
lt's sad to see a kid like that.

854
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:28,919
So, we just had to let him know
he was loved and valuable.

855
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,889
Taught him to trust in God
as a good father.

856
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:35,596
That wasn't an easy road.

857
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:41,335
So, when he rang that bell...

858
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:46,673
that was something.

859
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:52,615
So, the tradition
of the bell is, is what?

860
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,582
Accepting God?

861
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:55,085
Yeah, well...

862
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:59,322
it's kind of our tradition,
you know, but it's more than that.

863
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:02,623
lt's about accepting that
God has accepted you.

864
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:05,859
So, yeah.

865
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:09,394
Yeah, Shawn discovered
baseball here real quick.

866
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,666
God smiled on him with
that, as you can tell.

867
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:17,999
Now baseball is going to
give him an opportunity

868
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:20,272
to reach far beyond
that outfield fence.

869
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:23,406
He's going to get a good education.

870
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:27,378
Mr. Decker, he's going to make
a real difference in people's lives.

871
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:33,922
l'm asking you,
Mr. Decker, move on.

872
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:37,084
Don't interfere with
Shawn's decision.

873
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,331
l can't believe l'm saying this.

874
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:53,271
l think you're right.

875
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:02,348
Baseball, huh?

876
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:05,320
What a game.

877
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:08,156
lt's a great game.

878
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,362
Who'd you watch growing up?

879
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,857
Man, l used to love the Cubbies,

880
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,901
but l will say my favorite team
of all time,

881
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:26,168
the '93 Phillies when they went
to the world series, misfits.

882
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:29,374
Who do you like, today?

883
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:31,879
l like Tim Tebow.

884
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:33,374
Well, he doesn't play baseball.

885
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:34,675
Could if he wanted to.

886
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:42,149
Can we talk about Danny Cooke?

887
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:45,455
How'd you get the name Scooter?

888
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:48,320
Earned it, of course.

889
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:50,925
My dad gave it to me.

890
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,532
Stole just about every base
from here to the Dominican.

891
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:57,366
Ooh, so you're
worldwide, Scooter?

892
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:00,034
Nah, it's not like that.

893
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:02,702
My parents were missionaries.

894
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:08,781
Traveled all over, mostly third world
countries, spreading the gospel.

895
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:13,921
l grew up stealing bases.

896
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,284
And...

897
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:22,693
And?

898
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,731
Watching my parents
live out that gospel.

899
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:36,970
You were on everyone's radar,
and then you just disappeared.

900
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,177
That all depends on whose radar.

901
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,918
See, l played all through
the mission fields.

902
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:47,984
The thing is, Mr. Decker,

903
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:50,819
you could throw
a ball 100 miles an hour;

904
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:52,984
you're going to
get people's attention

905
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:55,531
when you bring them
something more powerful than that.

906
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,333
Did you ever think
of the platform

907
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:00,632
you could have standing on
the mound in Yankee stadium?

908
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,036
Of course, all the time.

909
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:04,040
l still do.

910
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:09,108
All l have to do,
though, is look out there.

911
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:14,943
See Joey, Shawn, PJ, and little red.

912
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:18,612
Those guys know l didn't disappear.

913
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:23,956
l saw you here the other day,
heard Joey ring that bell.

914
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:32,962
He made the most important decision of
his life right here in my own back yard.

915
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,302
Mr. Decker...

916
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:43,639
this is my Yankee stadium.

917
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:55,483
Look at PJ.

918
00:51:57,628 --> 00:51:59,357
Right beside Shawn
every step of the way.

919
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:07,904
Little red, this is his last stop
after six failed foster homes.

920
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:10,069
Six.

921
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:12,898
He doesn't want to leave.

922
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:18,839
They all came here with
a lot of hurt.

923
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,575
There's still plenty of
that to go around.

924
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:29,191
But what we can give them
is a lifetime of love and prayer.

925
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:32,558
There's hope, Mr. Decker.

926
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,097
They find it right here.

927
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:40,060
And that, my friend, is a hope they can
take with them the rest of their lives.

928
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,796
We don't pretend we can fix them.

929
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:46,469
We just want them to know
they've got a good father.

930
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:53,377
This father is never going to
leave them, never forsake them,

931
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:57,410
a father who's never going
to forget them,

932
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:00,054
Jesus Christ.

933
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,992
He's a father to the Fatherless.

934
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:11,156
l told you Shawn Hart's
off the table.

935
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:15,266
l'm not going to say
the same thing about you.

936
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:18,771
l would love to see what you can do
against some of the greats.

937
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:22,207
Not unless they show up
in my backyard.

938
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,577
You let me know how that
goes for you, all right?

939
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:43,822
l'm sorry.
There was no time to call.

940
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:45,797
We didn't know what else to do.

941
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:50,736
We were just sent to pick him up,
and his mom was in a car accident,

942
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:52,969
and there's no father,
no siblings.

943
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,335
We're trying to figure out
if there's any extended family.

944
00:53:56,046 --> 00:53:56,978
What's he been told?

945
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:59,249
All he knows is that
there's been an accident.

946
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:01,680
What's his name?

947
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:03,576
Jason.
He's 1 4.

948
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:04,646
Jason.

949
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:14,422
Hey, Jason.

950
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,564
l'm Scooter.

951
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:19,098
You hungry?

952
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:23,365
Come on, let's go inside.

953
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:30,740
l think l've got a cheeseburger
with your name written all over it.

954
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,079
We'll take it from here.

955
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:36,584
All right, l'll call you later.

956
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:47,829
ls there anything l can do?

957
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:52,897
Yeah.

958
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:57,137
The Casting Crowns concert
is tonight, and...

959
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,105
Scooter and l are not going
to be able to leave.

960
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:04,143
The boys were looking
so forward to it.

961
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:08,982
lt's probably best
if they're not here right now.

962
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:11,886
ls there any way you
could take them?

963
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:13,719
Yeah, of course.

964
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:24,690
All right, you boys be good.

965
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,127
Thank you.

966
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:29,366
Have a good night.

967
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:58,632
HaIIeIujah, haIIeIujah

968
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:05,574
Let my Iife song sing to You

969
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:06,538
Are you ready?

970
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:12,672
Let my Iife song sing to You

971
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,584
Let my Iife song sing to You

972
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:20,556
Let my Iife song sing to You

973
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,558
Let my Iife song sing to You

974
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,653
I want to sign your name
to the end of this day

975
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:30,933
Knowing that my heart was true

976
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:36,799
Let my Iife song sing to You

977
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:39,269
Can you shout glory?

978
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,337
Glory!

979
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:46,482
We want to sing to You

980
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:50,045
Jesus

981
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:53,951
Amen, give the Lord praise.

982
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,499
Leave it aII behind

983
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:12,567
Leave it aII behind

984
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:15,804
Leave it aII behind

985
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,180
Just Ieave it aII behind

986
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:29,148
I have aII you need,
but you keep on searching

987
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:35,497
I've done aII the work,
but you keep on working

988
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:41,834
When you're running on empty,
and you can't find the remedy

989
00:57:42,606 --> 00:57:44,631
Just come to the weII

990
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:54,848
You can spend your whoIe Iife
chasing what's missing

991
00:57:55,352 --> 00:58:01,086
But that empty inside,
it just ain't gonna Iisten

992
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:07,828
When nothing can satisfy,
and the worId Ieaves you high and dry

993
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:10,256
Just come to the weII

994
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:13,327
Yeah, yeah

995
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:19,842
And aII who thirst wiII
thirst no more

996
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:27,808
And aII who search wiII find
what their souIs Iong for

997
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:34,356
The worId wiII try,
but it can never fiII

998
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:40,663
Just Ieave it aII behind
and come to the weII

999
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:50,664
So bring me your heart,
no matter how broken

1000
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:57,137
Just come as you are when
your Iast prayer is spoken

1001
00:58:58,048 --> 00:59:00,539
Just rest in my arms a whiIe

1002
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,881
You'II feeI the change, my chiId

1003
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:06,314
When you come to the weII

1004
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:12,787
And aII who thirst wiII
thirst no more

1005
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:20,627
And aII who search wiII find
what their souIs Iong for

1006
00:59:21,872 --> 00:59:27,105
And the worId wiII try,
but it can never fiII

1007
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:33,608
Just Ieave it aII behind
and come to the weII

1008
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,111
Yeah

1009
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,724
Leave it aII behind

1010
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:54,302
And the worId wiII try,
but it can never fiII

1011
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:57,900
Just Ieave it aII behind

1012
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:07,815
And now that you're fuII
of Iove beyond measure

1013
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:14,384
Yourjoy's going to fIow
Iike a stream in the desert

1014
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:20,495
And soon aII the worId wiII see
Iiving water is found in me

1015
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,257
'Cause you've come to the weII

1016
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:25,962
How many of you guys believe
Jesus is the well tonight?

1017
01:00:26,937 --> 01:00:27,665
Let's sing it out.

1018
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:32,938
And aII who thirst wiII
thirst no more

1019
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:34,132
All who search...

1020
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:40,941
And aII who search wiII
find what their souIs Iong for

1021
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:47,417
And the worId wiII try,
but it can never fiII

1022
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:53,854
Just Ieave it aII behind

1023
01:00:54,931 --> 01:01:00,392
Leave it aII behind
and come to the weII

1024
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:02,101
Sing this with me.

1025
01:01:02,572 --> 01:01:03,698
Leave it all behind...

1026
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:06,498
Leave it aII behind

1027
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:09,771
Leave it aII behind

1028
01:01:10,714 --> 01:01:12,739
Leave it aII behind

1029
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:13,507
You guys sing.

1030
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,018
Leave it aII behind

1031
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,983
Leave it aII behind

1032
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:22,286
-Your pursuit of perfection
-Leave it aII behind

1033
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:25,427
-Your fear of rejection
-Leave it aII behind

1034
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:28,658
-Your temporary pIeasure
-Leave it aII behind

1035
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:31,490
-AII your earthIy treasure
-Leave it aII behind

1036
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:34,401
-Dried up empty reIigion
-Leave it aII behind

1037
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:36,132
Just Ieave it aII behind

1038
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:40,540
-Leave it aII behind
-Chains of rejection

1039
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:42,543
You can Ieave it aII behind

1040
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:44,672
Leave it aII behind

1041
01:01:44,748 --> 01:01:47,876
-AII the guiIt that weighs you down
-Leave it aII behind

1042
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:55,283
Just Ieave it aII behind
and come to the weII

1043
01:02:02,899 --> 01:02:03,797
Yeah, God is good.

1044
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:14,337
So, l want you guys to know
that before you got here, tonight,

1045
01:02:15,245 --> 01:02:18,237
all the tour, all the bands,
all the crew, we all gathered in here,

1046
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:22,648
and we walked through these chairs
praying for you before you got here,

1047
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:27,247
praying that this would be more than just
another Christian family fun night.

1048
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:30,283
Because some of you know
as good as l do, you know,

1049
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,328
a song might change your afternoon,

1050
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:34,189
but it's not going to
change your life.

1051
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:38,434
lt's going to take something
way more than feeling good

1052
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:40,895
and feeling better
to change your lives.

1053
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:46,468
l can't live by what l feel, but l live
by the truth God's word reveals.

1054
01:02:47,477 --> 01:02:51,675
And when l stand before God one day,
he's not going to ask me how l felt.

1055
01:02:52,248 --> 01:02:54,341
He's not going to ask me
what church l went to.

1056
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:56,716
He's not going to ask me
how many good things l do

1057
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,015
and how many bad
things l stopped doing.

1058
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:02,288
What he's going to ask me
is what did l do with Jesus?

1059
01:03:03,026 --> 01:03:05,620
Because we're all
in the same boat down here.

1060
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,927
No one's here any more
of a train wreck than

1061
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:10,465
the guy standing up here
with a microphone right now.

1062
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:15,735
We're lost, we're broken, we're fallen,
and we can't fix ourselves.

1063
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:18,840
So, don't come to a concert
and hear this, and then think,

1064
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:22,504
''l need to go get good and come
back to God,'' because you can't.

1065
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,847
lt's way too late
to get good. Yeah?

1066
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:29,411
l've gotta realize l'm broken,
and l've fallen,

1067
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:30,645
and l need Jesus.

1068
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,051
And God says in his word

1069
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:36,352
that if we confess with
our mouths that Jesus is Lord,

1070
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:41,090
and believe in our heart God raised him
from the dead, we'll be saved.

1071
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:45,022
Listen, confess with my
mouth that Jesus is Lord.

1072
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:48,437
Lord is not a nickname for Jesus.

1073
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:50,695
Lord means King.

1074
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:55,074
To be his is to confess
with my mouth that Jesus

1075
01:03:55,145 --> 01:04:01,345
is the Lord and King of my life forever,
and l will follow my King forever,

1076
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:04,050
and l believe in my heart
that the same God

1077
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:07,352
that raised Jesus from the dead
can raise me from the dead.

1078
01:04:07,757 --> 01:04:11,158
That's so much bigger
than trying to be better.

1079
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:15,130
lt's realizing,
''Lord, l need You.''

1080
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:18,089
l'm desperate, and l lay
my life at Your feet.

1081
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:23,334
l turn from the sin in my life,
and l'm following You, to be Yours.''

1082
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:25,235
That's good stuff.

1083
01:04:25,575 --> 01:04:27,042
You can do that, tonight.

1084
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,012
lf you feel like you're still
on the outside looking in,

1085
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:32,944
when it comes to
a friendship with God,

1086
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:40,355
Jesus himself said, ''No one comes to
the Father unless the spirit draws him.''

1087
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:43,155
So, if it's even on your
mind and in your heart,

1088
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:45,525
right now, to take a step
towards the Father,

1089
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:48,460
please know this is very personal.

1090
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:52,100
He's not waving his hand
over a crowd right now.

1091
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:54,833
He's calling you right now,

1092
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:58,131
and you can lay your life
at His feet tonight.

1093
01:04:58,741 --> 01:04:59,765
Can we just pray together?

1094
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:01,909
Let's just bow our heads
and close our eyes.

1095
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:03,275
There's nothing magical about it.

1096
01:05:03,379 --> 01:05:06,348
We're just getting
our mind off everybody else

1097
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:09,942
and asking God to show
his truth for us.

1098
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:14,584
Father, if anyone in here needs You,
they already know it.

1099
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,383
You've been moving in their lives
long before they got to this room.

1100
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:21,323
So now that we're here,

1101
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:26,768
it would be a tragedy to come this
close to the well and go home thirsty.

1102
01:05:29,606 --> 01:05:32,404
Lord, if anyone needs you, let them
lay their life at Your feet now.

1103
01:05:33,676 --> 01:05:34,574
Draw them to You.

1104
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:39,114
Guys, if you're here, and you want
to know Jesus, just tell Him.

1105
01:05:39,682 --> 01:05:40,944
Say, ''Lord, l'm Yours.

1106
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:44,447
Take my sin, take my junk,
take all the garbage.

1107
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,454
l lay it at Your feet,
and l'll follow You.''

1108
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:49,454
lf you're here, tonight,

1109
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:51,857
and that is what your
heart is crying out,

1110
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:53,855
l want to pray with you.

1111
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,323
There's some pastors in
the area that have been

1112
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:59,061
praying for this event
long before you got here,

1113
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:00,963
and they'd love to meet
you down here in the front,

1114
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:02,995
just pray with you before you go.

1115
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:07,199
Because as cool as this moment is
in here, life isn't like this,

1116
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:10,073
all quiet and tidy,
while we get our thoughts together.

1117
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:13,346
We've got to leave this
building and know how to live,

1118
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,919
and we need to walk with Jesus
in a church that will love us.

1119
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,378
l'll meet you right down here.

1120
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,887
As the pastors come forward,
you come down.

1121
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:24,284
Meet us down here,
and let us pray with you guys.

1122
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:25,591
You come.

1123
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:41,968
lf you want someone to come with you,
you bring them with you.

1124
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:43,376
Just come down here with us.

1125
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:56,921
Father God, thank you
for being so real to us.

1126
01:06:58,461 --> 01:07:02,090
Thank you, God, that you didn't need
any of this to go on to talk to us;

1127
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:06,232
but, Lord, you've used
this moment to draw

1128
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:08,293
some brand new brothers
and sisters to You.

1129
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,066
Lord, thank you for what
you're doing.

1130
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:13,600
God, I thank you that
You are the reformer

1131
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:17,305
and the reshaper,
the transformer of our Iives.

1132
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:19,111
We Iove you, and we thank you.

1133
01:07:19,215 --> 01:07:21,308
In Jesus' name, amen.

1134
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,685
You run

1135
01:07:30,593 --> 01:07:39,433
You run as far as
you can run from Iove

1136
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:48,775
You run to the ends of the worId

1137
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:54,171
To the ends of the worId

1138
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:59,281
To the ends of the worId

1139
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:03,118
To the ends of the worId

1140
01:08:13,803 --> 01:08:15,270
Hey buddy, did you have fun?

1141
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:18,068
How was it?

1142
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:20,599
How is he?

1143
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:22,136
Great news.

1144
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:23,803
His mom's going to be okay,

1145
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,246
and they located his uncle
in the next town over.

1146
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:27,575
That is good news.

1147
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,950
Thank you so much.

1148
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:33,285
Come on, let's go.

1149
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:17,859
l told Daisy l would pray.

1150
01:09:24,507 --> 01:09:25,201
God, l...

1151
01:09:28,244 --> 01:09:29,176
l know you're up there.

1152
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:35,841
l know you're real...

1153
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:42,658
because l've seen You.

1154
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:48,794
l've seen You here...

1155
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:55,567
in this place.

1156
01:10:04,714 --> 01:10:06,181
Thank you for letting me see this.

1157
01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:34,168
Hi, mom.

1158
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:38,376
No, l'm fine.
Everything is okay.

1159
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:42,141
l will.

1160
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:46,486
l just called to say hi.

1161
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:52,955
No, no, l'm not laughing at you.

1162
01:10:56,532 --> 01:10:57,226
l will.

1163
01:11:00,236 --> 01:11:01,134
Yeah, l know.

1164
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:04,063
l know you're praying for me.

1165
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:07,172
That's what moms do.

1166
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:12,642
l will.

1167
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:17,610
l love you, too, mom.

1168
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:19,239
This is Rob.

1169
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:20,404
Rob, where are you?

1170
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:22,508
-What?
-The guys are waiting for you.

1171
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:24,576
-What time is it?
-It's 10:00 in the morning.

1172
01:12:24,654 --> 01:12:25,848
Did you just wake up?

1173
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:34,757
Maggie, l need
to borrow your bike.

1174
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:36,092
That's not a good idea.

1175
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:38,291
No, really, Mr. Decker,
that is not a good idea!

1176
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,498
Bring it back, Mr. Decker!

1177
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:42,196
No, stop that!

1178
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:44,535
No, no, no! Come back, come back,
come, come back!

1179
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,231
Thanks, Maggie!

1180
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:48,971
lt doesn't have any brakes!

1181
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:12,324
Oh, boy.

1182
01:13:12,368 --> 01:13:14,063
-Are you kidding?
-This isn't going to end good.

1183
01:13:19,675 --> 01:13:20,539
Are you kidding me?

1184
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,372
You all right, buddy?

1185
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,374
Rob, look who
showed up in my backyard.

1186
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:28,743
Mr. Cy young over here,
Rick Sutcliffe.

1187
01:13:29,452 --> 01:13:31,682
Remember the '93 Phillies team
l was telling you about?

1188
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,149
This is Jon Kruk.

1189
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:36,016
Mr. All star over here,
Ben Zobrist.

1190
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,419
Man, the performance
was great, but,

1191
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:40,654
the dismount and
landing was terrible.

1192
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:43,856
Kruky, what do
you think about that?

1193
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:44,558
A couple of things.

1194
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,430
With the bike, first of all,
are you kidding me?

1195
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:48,700
Did you sleep in the clothes?

1196
01:13:49,772 --> 01:13:50,932
Well, at your age Sut,

1197
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:53,036
you wonder why our careers
are in the toilet right now?

1198
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:54,335
That's what represents us.

1199
01:13:55,478 --> 01:13:57,537
Yeah, you can all laugh,
you can all laugh.

1200
01:13:58,114 --> 01:13:59,638
lf you're gonna eat,
you'd better eat quick,

1201
01:13:59,715 --> 01:14:02,843
because l'm here to see some of that
Florida heat l've been hearing about.

1202
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:06,084
Go get 'em, Scooter.

1203
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:07,613
All right.

1204
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:18,165
Sut, it's on.

1205
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:19,895
Oh, not me.
l'm the pitcher.

1206
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:22,198
Obviously, he's not going anywhere.

1207
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:23,660
Go get 'em, Big Ben.

1208
01:14:24,273 --> 01:14:25,570
lt's all up to you, buddy.

1209
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:26,900
l'd love to.

1210
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:28,105
All right, batter up!

1211
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:29,802
Let's go, Ben.

1212
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:31,338
How you doin' Ken?

1213
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:36,176
All right.

1214
01:14:37,787 --> 01:14:38,515
We're gonna die.

1215
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:40,052
You want to take a few first?

1216
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,614
l'm good.

1217
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:43,515
l love it.

1218
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:44,555
That's not good.

1219
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:53,459
You kidding me?

1220
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:55,063
You might need that, man.

1221
01:14:58,674 --> 01:14:59,766
l'm gonna take you up on that one.

1222
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:00,707
A little practice.

1223
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:02,037
Heads up.

1224
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:11,313
-There it is.
-Oh, my.

1225
01:15:11,654 --> 01:15:12,484
There it is.

1226
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:13,717
That's pretty good.

1227
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:14,813
Better you than me.

1228
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:15,584
What did l tell you guys?

1229
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:16,852
What did l tell you guys?

1230
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:34,702
Uncle Charlie is in the house.

1231
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,046
You didn't swing and
miss that much last year.

1232
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,369
All right, l've got this.

1233
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:41,510
Time to get serious, fellas.

1234
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,220
l am so glad l'm old.

1235
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:52,051
What's he doing
out here in this pasture?

1236
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:53,994
Take this stuff to the show.

1237
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:55,257
l'm trying my best.

1238
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:58,166
All right, you guys are gonna want to
step behind the screen for this one.

1239
01:15:58,634 --> 01:15:59,293
Oh, wait.

1240
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:01,399
l've got you, buddy.

1241
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:02,803
All right.

1242
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:05,967
l think somebody
is a little upset.

1243
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:06,740
l'll tell you what.

1244
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:08,174
This all started out as
nice fun and games.

1245
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:09,871
This is serious stuff
right now, son.

1246
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:10,503
Come on, Ben.

1247
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:11,910
Show 'em where you live, baby.

1248
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,091
And the mighty Casey has struck out.

1249
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:29,620
Game over.

1250
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:31,023
All right, boys, this is it.

1251
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:35,629
Bottom of the ninth, two outs,
full count, bases loaded,

1252
01:16:36,038 --> 01:16:37,232
and you know
you're down by three.

1253
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:39,331
l've got him.

1254
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:40,670
With Kruky hitting behind you.

1255
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,235
You'd better go deep,
or this one's over.

1256
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:52,849
Oh, baby.

1257
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:22,479
What just happened?

1258
01:17:23,052 --> 01:17:23,916
lt's a tradition.

1259
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,286
When someone accepts
Jesus into their heart,

1260
01:17:26,388 --> 01:17:27,514
they get to ring the bell.

1261
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:28,779
Really?

1262
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,317
l have Jesus in my heart,
and l never got to ring the bell.

1263
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:33,821
Well, get up there!
Come on!

1264
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:36,929
Guys, make some room!

1265
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:47,039
That's what l'm talking about.

1266
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:50,176
Ben, thank you so much
for coming out, man.

1267
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:51,201
l really appreciate it.

1268
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:52,741
Rob, thanks for
bringing us out here.

1269
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:53,905
Yeah, you're welcome.

1270
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,350
You know, l really think
you've found something here.

1271
01:17:57,252 --> 01:17:58,742
Yeah, thanks, man.

1272
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:05,025
Fellas, thanks for coming.

1273
01:18:05,627 --> 01:18:06,651
Don't ruin his career.

1274
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:07,985
He's got some future.

1275
01:18:08,964 --> 01:18:09,931
l love the confidence, man.

1276
01:18:09,965 --> 01:18:12,092
Sut, thank you so much
for coming out.

1277
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:13,392
l had a great time.
Good luck.

1278
01:18:13,502 --> 01:18:14,298
Thank you, guys.

1279
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:15,302
See you, Rob.

1280
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:16,804
-See you later, Rob.
-See you guys.

1281
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:29,045
And aII who thirst
wiII thirst no more

1282
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:37,454
And aII who search wiII find
what their souIs Iong for

1283
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:44,255
The worId wiII try,
but it can never fiII

1284
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:51,867
So Ieave it aII behind
and come to the weII

1285
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:01,377
You're amazing.

1286
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:04,945
l mean it.

1287
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:07,881
Thank you.

1288
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,558
You could have a real audience.

1289
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,755
l do have a real audience.

1290
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:21,795
Rob...

1291
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:27,900
your head's down,
and you're so focused, but...

1292
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,172
you can miss a lot that way.

1293
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:39,412
Sometimes what you're looking for
isn't what you're looking for.

1294
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:53,366
Just admit l was right, please.

1295
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:54,459
About what?

1296
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:55,595
About Scooter.

1297
01:19:56,605 --> 01:19:58,402
He is that good.
l'm not crazy.

1298
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,167
You saw it.
You heard them.

1299
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:04,104
You have to admit he'd be
an unbelievable pitcher in the bigs.

1300
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:05,812
He'd be more than unbelievable.

1301
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:07,840
He'd make the hall of fame.

1302
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:09,413
What did you say?

1303
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:14,019
Scooter would be the best;
the best ever, maybe.

1304
01:20:16,892 --> 01:20:19,793
-l never thought you'd ever...
-Why would me saying that surprise you?

1305
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,119
l know my baseball.

1306
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:25,764
lf l managed the Yankees,
he'd be my Rivera.

1307
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:29,437
He's got a fast ball most people
haven't seen since...

1308
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:30,434
Since never?

1309
01:20:36,145 --> 01:20:39,478
God gives people incredible gifts,
some more than one.

1310
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:43,011
Maybe they have to choose.

1311
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:47,017
For Scooter and l, that choice
felt more like a calling.

1312
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,252
Scooter was only 1 7.

1313
01:20:51,293 --> 01:20:53,659
He had his whole life
ahead of him, but...

1314
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:57,189
we grew up watching
my parents help people.

1315
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,191
Whoever, wherever...

1316
01:21:02,538 --> 01:21:03,334
all the time.

1317
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,333
My parents were missionaries,
even here.

1318
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:11,273
This place was their dream.

1319
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:17,382
l didn't know that.

1320
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:20,346
You couldn't have known,

1321
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:25,392
just like Scooter and l couldn't have
known how one moment,

1322
01:21:26,995 --> 01:21:30,396
one phone call would change
our lives forever.

1323
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:37,672
ln an instant, we went from
helping orphans to being orphans.

1324
01:21:41,143 --> 01:21:42,872
My parents died in a plane crash,

1325
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:46,344
and what could have destroyed
our hope in God

1326
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:48,844
only taught
us to trust in him more.

1327
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:53,481
-l wouldn't have known what to do.
-We didn't either...

1328
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:56,856
but we learned.

1329
01:21:58,927 --> 01:21:59,723
We had to.

1330
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:04,165
This, this place...

1331
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:07,157
felt like our calling.

1332
01:22:09,104 --> 01:22:09,695
We're home.

1333
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:12,936
Shawn's home.

1334
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:18,479
And that bell,

1335
01:22:20,682 --> 01:22:23,651
to hear that bell ring and to
know what that sound represents,

1336
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:26,913
to hear what just happened
to a heart,

1337
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:32,651
to know something that that person
can't keep to themselves,

1338
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:35,863
l don't think l could ask
for anything more.

1339
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:40,764
This place...

1340
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:46,608
This place is amazing.

1341
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:47,907
How do you even get by?

1342
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:50,740
By faith.

1343
01:22:52,014 --> 01:22:53,982
We walk by faith,
and we pray a lot.

1344
01:22:56,485 --> 01:23:00,114
We pray, and we share
whatever God provides.

1345
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:02,988
And He does provide.

1346
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:09,285
The people in this town,
they really come through for us.

1347
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:11,733
They support us.

1348
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:23,870
And, you know, you can't be around
these boys and not be inspired.

1349
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,639
And that inspiration comes
from watching you and Scooter.

1350
01:23:26,815 --> 01:23:28,874
And our inspiration comes from God.

1351
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:40,150
Maybe that's what it is.

1352
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:48,528
That concert last night...

1353
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,974
l felt something there that
l've never felt before...

1354
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:05,019
like l didn't want to stay
where l was or how l was.

1355
01:24:05,454 --> 01:24:06,318
You don't have to.

1356
01:24:09,324 --> 01:24:10,313
That's God, Rob.

1357
01:24:12,527 --> 01:24:13,892
He's at the door of your heart.

1358
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:19,431
All you have to do is
open the door and invite him in.

1359
01:24:20,302 --> 01:24:21,064
l wish.

1360
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,331
l wish it was that easy.

1361
01:24:29,244 --> 01:24:30,370
l've got a lot of stuff.

1362
01:24:30,579 --> 01:24:32,240
We've all got stuff, Rob.

1363
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,306
God knows we've got stuff.

1364
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:41,881
That's why Jesus came
to free us from all that.

1365
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:46,358
Don't hold on to the stuff.

1366
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:49,988
Lay it down.

1367
01:24:51,233 --> 01:24:51,961
l want to.

1368
01:24:57,672 --> 01:25:00,732
l want what you have, but...

1369
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:03,378
That is what l have, though, Rob.

1370
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:11,508
Beautiful, undeserved
grace and forgiveness.

1371
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:15,623
lt's yours, too.

1372
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:18,953
Whatever your stuff,

1373
01:25:20,862 --> 01:25:21,886
it's yours, too.

1374
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:28,800
All you have to do is invite him in
and ask him for forgiveness.

1375
01:25:41,316 --> 01:25:42,806
l don't like asking
anyone for anything.

1376
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:45,583
That's not who l am.

1377
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:48,384
That is who he is.

1378
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:51,291
You're going to have to
do the asking this time.

1379
01:25:53,929 --> 01:25:58,127
You know, there's strength that
comes from asking for help.

1380
01:26:05,607 --> 01:26:06,972
Accept his gift of grace.

1381
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:10,335
lnvite him in.

1382
01:26:11,913 --> 01:26:13,540
His hand is outstretched.

1383
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:15,850
All you have to do is
reach out and take it.

1384
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:28,327
Looks like your car is ready.

1385
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:54,248
Well, here she is, good as new.

1386
01:26:55,724 --> 01:26:56,349
What do l owe?

1387
01:26:57,559 --> 01:26:59,550
A lady named Claire called
and took care of everything.

1388
01:27:00,295 --> 01:27:01,125
Well, thank you.

1389
01:27:22,684 --> 01:27:23,480
l guess this is it.

1390
01:27:33,595 --> 01:27:34,892
The first time
l didn't get my man.

1391
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:37,559
Do you mean Shawn or Scooter?

1392
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:38,589
Both.

1393

This waIk is hard

1400
01:29:00,148 --> 01:29:03,606

And I can't do this on my own

1402
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:16,354
But in this darkness I can see,
your Iight is shining down
