1
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,545
Everything OK?

2
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,545
Yeah, I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking.

3
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:15,545
Oh, you're welcome.

4
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:19,545
My toes are really itching
though, it's kind of annoying.

5
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:22,546
Where are we?

6
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,546
Pakistan.

7
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,545
- Really?
- No, not really.

8
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,545
You think I'm weak, I'm a
girl, right, a little girl.

9
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:40,546
Little girls are not weak,
they're very strong.

10
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:48,546
I swear to God... every day when I
wake up it seems things have sped up.

11
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:51,545
Not by much. Just a little bit.

12
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:54,546
It's almost imperceptible but I can see it.

13
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,547
Everything around me is slowly speeding up.

14
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:59,548
Maybe everything is the same and
it's you slowing down?

15
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:06,547
You're going to be fine, trust me.

16
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,547
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you.

17
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,548
You said you had an itch.

18
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,548
- Right... on my toes.
- Exactly.

19
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,548
Hello?

20
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:59,549
Wes? Hey, how are you doing? It's Alison.

21
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:04,549
Alison?

22
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,550
- Hey? Can you hang on a second?
- Yeah.

23
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,549
Hey.

24
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,550
- Shit, did I wake you up?
- Not really.

25
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,550
Guess what? I'm in town.

26
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,550
Yeah, I've heard you were in town. I
didn't think you were going to call.

27
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,550
Yeah, I wasn't but... it's so silly.

28
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,552
I mean I'm here and I'm not
even going to say hello?

29
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,551
It's nice to hear your voice.

30
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,550
I'm leaving in the morning.

31
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,551
- You are?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,551
Do you want to drive me to the airport?

33
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,552
Yeah, OK. I'd love to.

34
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:11,551
- Can I come in and say 'hi'?
- Right now?

35
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:16,551
Yeah. There's a few hours
left, we can catch up,

36
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,552
bake muffins or something. I don't know.

37
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:28,552
I'm really sorry to be calling so late.
I was trying not to call at all.

38
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:38,552
So I guess I'll just finish packing my
bags and get over to your place.

39
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,553
Yeah.

40
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:48,552
All right. See you soon.

41
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:51,552
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

42
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,553
It was so quiet at the canyon...

43
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,553
Could have stayed there forever.

44
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:02,555
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

45
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,555
- You've changed things around.
- No, I didn't.

46
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:18,556
You didn't?

47
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,556
Did I?

48
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,556
- Hello.
- Hi.

49
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,556
There's lots of new pictures.

50
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,556
You've had a fun year, huh?

51
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,556
Sorry.

52
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,555
I like these blue chairs. Those are new.

53
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,557
Yeah.

54
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:54,557
More pictures...

55
00:08:58,556 --> 00:08:59,557
She's pretty.

56
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,557
Yeah, she's great.

57
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:11,557
You look different. Do I like different?

58
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:15,556
- What do you mean I look different?
- Well I don't know... different.

59
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:18,558
You look healthy. Not that
you didn't look healthy before.

60
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,558
So... I guess that's not really it.

61
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,558
Can I take a shower?

62
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,558
It's kind of hot.

63
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,559
- Wow, pretty cool place.
- Yeah, it's nice.

64
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,559
Here, you can take this room upstairs.
It's my parents'.

65
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,558
I thought you lived
herewith your boyfriend.

66
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,559
Yeah, we live here together but
it's my parents apartment.

67
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,559
They let us use it because
they're never here.

68
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,560
They live in South Africa
now, lucky bastards.

69
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,559
South Africa? Wow!

70
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
So, where's your boyfriend?

71
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,560
He left me... for a week.

72
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,558
To go sailing with some
friend she hasn't seen for ages.

73
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,560
Like two years or something.
Can you imagine? Two years?

74
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:39,560
- What's his name?
- Kai.

75
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,559
- That's a cool name. What does he do?
- He designs super-computers...

76
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,561
Like computers that are used to
design more advanced computers.

77
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:49,560
That sort of thing...

78
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,561
- No shit?
- Yeah, no shit.

79
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:08,562
Montreal has the best vegetables.

80
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,561
Everybody always thinks hockey or
maple syrup when they think Canada

81
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:15,562
but really what they should
be thinking is vegetables.

82
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,561
I don't know. I think
'cold' when I think 'Canada'.

83
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,562
Friendly but cold.

84
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,560
Isn't that a...

85
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:27,562
What's that word for when you say two
things that cancel each other out?

86
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,561
- There's no word.
- There's a word.

87
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,562
No, there ain't. Strict tripping, honey.

88
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,562
Don't call me 'honey'. I
didn't come from a bee.

89
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:44,563
- Do you like artichokes?
- I'm the king of artichokes.

90
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:48,563
Well, then it's your lucky day because
I'm the queen of artichoke salad.

91
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:52,561
How feng-shui of us, huh?
The king, the queen

92
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:55,563
- the kitchen is in full harmony right now.

93
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:04,563
- I'm hungry.
- Me too. Can I cook?

94
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:08,563
- Sure, can I get drunk?
- Why not?

95
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:16,564
What do you think?

96
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,563
You think he's going to
make USA good omelet?

97
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:22,564
The best omelet you have ever had.
Queen of the artichokes.

98
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:38,564
- Do you like pictures?
- Pictures?

99
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:45,565
- Pictures, yes.
- Sure.

100
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,564
Me too.

101
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:53,564
Seems odd I've only known
you for like a week.

102
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,565
I know, ain't that interesting?
Everything is so random.

103
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:00,564
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

104
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:03,566
Some people wake up, have a nice breakfast,

105
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,564
decide to go to store to buy light bulbs...

106
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:10,565
Get hit by a bus and die... on a Tuesday.

107
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,566
To a lot of other people nothing
happens on that day.

108
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:19,566
Such a boring day to die. Tuesday.
I want to die on Friday.

109
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:24,566
- Anything but Monday.
- Yeah, that's got to be so bad.

110
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,566
How many pictures you can
take with that thing?

111
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:34,566
Like a hundred or something.

112
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,566
I really want to buy a new one,
with more megapixels, you know.

113
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,567
I love that word - megapixel.

114
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,566
But I'm kind of broke so I don't know.

115
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,566
Maybe I'm going to get one for Christmas.

116
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,567
Do you think it's OK to buy
yourself gifts on major holidays?

117
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,567
It's kind like kissing
yourself on the mirror.

118
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,566
'You're so pretty, I love you'.
That sort of thing.

119
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,566
What do you mean 'broke'?
I thought you guys were rich.

120
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,566
Super-computer engineering.
That sounds very expensive.

121
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,567
Yeah, I don't know.

122
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,568
It's Kai's money.

123
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,567
That's how I look at it. Otherwise
I'll never get anywhere.

124
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:16,566
Right now I make 7,50 an
hour working at the bookstore

125
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,567
but I spend it on books, Cd’s and alcohol.

126
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,567
So I never have any money.

127
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:26,567
But you are enjoying yourself.
Isn't that the point of money?

128
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,568
Exactly

129
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,568
I really like my feet too.
Aren't they pretty?

130
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,568
They're great.

131
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:41,568
Oh! I have the coolest picture of my toes.
You've got to see it.

132
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,568
It's really cool. You're going to like it.

133
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,568
- Where's this?
- Indonesia.

134
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,568
We took a little vacation there a year
ago with a couple of our friends.

135
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,570
It was a lot of fun, we traveled to
all these little islands...

136
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,570
Oh, there it is! Isn't that cool?!

137
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,569
- Wow, look at you... you're an artist!
- I know.

138
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,569
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my friend Misaki.

139
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,569
That's her husband, I
can't pronounce his name.

140
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,569
Oh, my God! The sun was so hot that day.

141
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,569
I tried putting coconut oil on skin

142
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,569
because it's supposed to
help me get a nice tan

143
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,571
but all I got was a nice sunburn.
Smelled really good though.

144
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,570
I bet.

145
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,570
That's me and Misaki drinking rum.

146
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:57,571
And there's me and Kai drinking more rum.

147
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:01,571
And that's me kind of really drunk.

148
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,571
- Nice.
- Yeah.

149
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:06,570
Why don't I show you New Zealand now?

150
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:09,571
I used to live there... Before I met Kai.

151
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:13,570
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

152
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:15,571
I had this tiny apartment right by
the ocean. It was pretty cool.

153
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:19,571
- What were you doing there?
- Studying... well - kind of.

154
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,572
- Sound like you had a good time.
- I had a lot of fun, yeah.

155
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:28,572
I had this great boyfriend, Alex.

156
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,572
He was so beautiful, he had
the most amazing green eyes.

157
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,572
I miss him sometimes.

158
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,572
We were always making love, it was... nice.

159
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:45,573
New Zealand... seems so far away.

160
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:51,573
Yeah... it's like it never
happened in a way. Like a dream.

161
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,573
All the things I did, all the people I met,

162
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:58,573
the millions of times I kissed Alex...

163
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,573
Looked him in the eyes like
nothing else mattered...

164
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,573
And now it's just a memory.

165
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:10,573
I'm boring you.

166
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:15,574
- You think I'm crazy.
- No, not really. Little bit.

167
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,573
You're really quiet.

168
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,572
Do you have cholesterol?

169
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:27,573
Cholesterol kind of numbs
your brain, you know that?

170
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,573
It's like chocolate but worse.

171
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,574
- Really?
- Yeah, I read it in magazine.

172
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:34,573
You need to watch what you eat.

173
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,575
Be more respectful of your body, you know?

174
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:40,574
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

175
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:43,573
Yeah, I should quit.

176
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:45,574
Do you want to go dancing?

177
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,575
- It's like 2 A.M.
- I know.

178
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:54,574
- I don't dance.
- You don't dance?

179
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,575
What... are you shy?

180
00:17:58,575 --> 00:17:59,574
No.

181
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:29,576
What is this?

182
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:38,576
It's a worthy effort. I've got
good intention, you know.

183
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:46,576
Cows are great, don't get me wrong.
I love them. The bovine of choice.

184
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:51,577
I get it, really. But
I'm not sure it's you.

185
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,576
See, to me you look like
an idiot in costume

186
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:57,577
jumping up and down in
the middle of Pakistan.

187
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:00,577
But, look, what do I know, right?

188
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:06,576
But I will say this... And
many people will agree...

189
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,577
From here to Timbuktu...

190
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:13,577
If you really want to, you can fly.

191
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:21,577
Go places far, far away. By
that I mean become a superstar.

192
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,578
Shine up in the sky and
all that good stuff.

193
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,577
Superstar? I don't know.

194
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,578
Put your head back on.

195
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:38,579
Now repeat after me: 'I'm a superstar'.

196
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,577
I'm a superstar.

197
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:44,579
- I can fly and shit.
- I can fly and shit.

198
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:50,578
Now, go on. Go tell the world.

199
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,579
I'm a superstar.

200
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,579
I'm a superstar.

201
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,578
I'm a superstar.

202
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,578
I can fly and shit.

203
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,579
I'm a superstar.

204
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,579
I'm a superstar.

205
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
Do you like Madonna?

206
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,581
I like her, not when she sings.

207
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
She's vegetarian, right?

208
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:48,580
I think I'm going have to start eating
meat again. I'm always tired.

209
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,580
Maybe it's because you're
stressed too much.

210
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:57,580
- I think you're stressed too much.
- What do you mean?

211
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:00,581
I get to the gas station

212
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:02,581
and the guy there was
making fun of your shoes,

213
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:05,581
and I tried to laugh with him, you know.
You were freaking out.

214
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,581
I wasn't freaking out.
That guy was an idiot.

215
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:15,581
OK but you were angry. And
that has got to be stressful.

216
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:22,581
- Well, I'm not always angry.
- Not always but...

217
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,581
What? I'm a bitch?

218
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:28,582
- Is that it?
- No, you're awesome.

219
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:30,582
That's right.

220
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,583
Truth said sometimes you
freak out for no reason.

221
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,582
Like you haven't had sex for
a long time or something.

222
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,582
What? I have plenty of sex, thank you.

223
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,583
You're the one that's always jerking off.

224
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:48,582
What?

225
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:51,583
You don't think I heard you last
night in a motel room?

226
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:56,582
I did not jerk off at the
motel last night, I'm sorry.

227
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,582
I couldn't do that with you in a room.
Are you crazy?

228
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,583
- You were making funny noises.
- I was not.

229
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,583
- Were you thinking about me?
- God.

230
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:11,583
God doesn't exist.

231
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,584
I know.

232
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:28,584
- Am I like haughty sort of type?
- No, sometimes, that's all.

233
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,584
No, you're right.

234
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:38,584
I mean I'm very direct and honest
and people don't like that.

235
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:43,583
They prefer if you just
smile and say pretty things...

236
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:48,585
About them especially... Nobody
wants to hear the truth.

237
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,585
The truth is not cool.

238
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:54,585
Unlike... Madonna?

239
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:59,585
Yeah, she's cool.

240
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:03,585
But she's getting old. I think
it's good for image though.

241
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,585
Makes you forget she's a whore.

242
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:31,586
It's like impossible to take
a good picture of you.

243
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:05,587
Wow, I had a good time in there.
Your shower is like great.

244
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:20,588
So... who's this?

245
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,587
That's Marriona, the girl I met in Brazil.

246
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,587
I told you about her, remember?

247
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:27,588
Oh, that's her?

248
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:31,588
- She's like 12.
- She's a bit older than that.

249
00:24:34,588 --> 00:24:36,587
- Can I keep it?
- Why?

250
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:40,588
It's a pretty picture with
ocean and everything.

251
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,588
Right.

252
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,587
No, really, I mean it. It's very peaceful.

253
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:51,589
And your friend looks so happy and
relaxed in that tiny, tiny bikini.

254
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:56,589
She's a really nice girl. You'd like her.

255
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,588
- Oh my God! Is this it?
- No.

256
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:10,588
Yes it is, it's got your name on it.

257
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:13,589
Yeah, I'll send you a copy for
Christmas, how's that?

258
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,588
- Why can't I just read this one?
- Because.

259
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,589
Come on, it's been driving me
crazy I can't find it anywhere.

260
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,589
So it will make a really
nice Christmas present.

261
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,590
Fine. But don't forget, OK?

262
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,589
And you have to send a nice card with it.

263
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,591
Something really funny

264
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,590
- a bunch of reindeers in
swimming pool wearing sunglasses.

265
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,589
Or a snowman in microwave... freaking out.

266
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,589
You're going to be disappointed. I'm
telling you it's really boring.

267
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,590
I don't care.

268
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:45,590
'Entropy and the second
law of thermodynamics'?

269
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,591
What did you expect?

270
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,591
Something about little Fluffy
animals with no arms, like you said.

271
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,591
Sorry.

272
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,590
I wrote it in college. It had to be boring.

273
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,592
Are you going to be a
scientist or something?

274
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:06,591
Not really. At some point I wanted to
be a vet... I really like dogs.

275
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,591
But then I realised that you've
got to take care of all the animals,

276
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:13,592
not just dogs but turtles,
pelicans, ferrets...

277
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:15,591
It's kind of like being a lawyer.

278
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,590
You don't really get to
choose your clients.

279
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:22,591
Right... I don't trust those things.
They can't even see straight.

280
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:27,592
- Lawyers?
- No, ferrets.

281
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:31,591
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

282
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:34,591
- What do you want?
- Anything. What are you having?

283
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,592
- Cranberry juice.
- That stuff is disgusting.

284
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:41,592
Well, how about milk and cookies?

285
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:44,592
I tell you what - put a shot of
vodka and that cranberry stuff of yours

286
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:47,593
and you've got yourself a deal.

287
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:35,594
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

288
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,595
Hello, my name is Robbie robot.

289
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,594
Stop touching my stuff.

290
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:50,593
It's fun. You have so many weird things.

291
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:51,594
Yeah...

292
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,594
So how's the life in Tokyo?

293
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,595
It's OK.

294
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,596
Boring?

295
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:10,595
Yes and no.

296
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:12,596
Maybe it's me.

297
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:16,596
You know, work on that.

298
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:20,596
I know.

299
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:26,595
So, those cookies you mentioned...
Are they for real?

300
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:30,596
Yeah, you want one, they're real good.
Made them myself.

301
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:33,596
I can only have one?

302
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:20,596
Didn't you put the
sunscreen on this morning?

303
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:24,598
Yeah but this is different. It's
a moisturizer without hydroxen.

304
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,597
It makes my skin
regenerate four times faster

305
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:31,598
and it improves elasticity.
Makes me look pretty.

306
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,598
- Good, you're so Metro.
- What?

307
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,598
You're metrosexual. Admit it.

308
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,599
What is that?

309
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,599
- Are you kidding me?
- No, is it like a big deal?

310
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:51,598
Oh my God, what planet are you from?

311
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,600
Don't you watch TV, read newspapers,
magazines... it's everywhere.

312
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,598
They did an episode about it on
'South park'. It was hilarious.

313
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,599
I don't watch TV.

314
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,599
How can you live like that?

315
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,600
You're missing out on all the good stuff.

316
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,600
No, I'm not.

317
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,598
- So what am I anyway?
- Metrosexual.

318
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,598
You're basically gay but you like women.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

319
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,600
It's becoming quite popular in big cities.

320
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,598
I'm in touch with my feminine
side and I take care of myself.

321
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,598
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing. It's great.

322
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,599
You're a renaissance man.

323
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,599
You're conscientious about
your image and body,

324
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
you dress well,

325
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:36,600
you're very docile and
gentle like a little puppy...

326
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,599
And you're very secure with your sexuality.

327
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,600
- You can say that again, sister.
- I'm serious. Girls like that, you know.

328
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:49,599
Metrosexual man do what they want,
they don't care if their behaviour

329
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,601
goes against the traditional
image of masculinity.

330
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:59,600
- Confidence is so sexy.
- You're so right.

331
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:03,600
I eat organic food, I drink herbal
tea, I got all sorts of vitamins...

332
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,600
You're in touch with your feelings...

333
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:08,601
I know nothing about sports... Pretty cool.

334
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,601
Personally - I think it's kind
of gay but that's just me.

335
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:18,601
I like big biceps,
testosterone and red meat.

336
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:22,601
- No, you don't.
- No really, that's me.

337
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,602
- You're funny.
- What?

338
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:28,602
Nothing.

339
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:33,602
OK, Johnny deep, go over there.

340
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:46,602
- Johnny deep - he's Metro, right?
- Oh yeah, baby. He's Metro. Yummy.

341
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,602
I guess it's pretty good
time to be a woman, huh?

342
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,602
Yeah, it's not bad.

343
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:57,603
No picking, pervert!

344
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:03,604
OK, you can turn around now.

345
00:32:07,603 --> 00:32:09,603
You definitely have a Metro butt.

346
00:32:14,603 --> 00:32:15,605
Let's go.

347
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:24,606
I'm feeling really sexy right now.

348
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,605
You should.

349
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,606
That's what I'm saying. I feel great.

350
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:38,606
Do you know how you were born, Wes?
How your life began?

351
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:42,606
- I have a pretty good idea, yeah.
- No you don't.

352
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,607
You came to this world billions
of years ago, my friend.

353
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:49,607
In a galaxy far, faraway.

354
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:55,606
Couple of planets collided,
Adams through here and there

355
00:33:55,607 --> 00:34:01,607
and you Wesley Jack Montgomery began to
exist in a very loose sort of way.

356
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:04,607
Loose?

357
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:07,607
Mhm. See, for a while you
were just floating around.

358
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:13,608
Traveling, if you wish.
Interstellar winds, comets...

359
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:16,607
You were all over the place, man.

360
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:20,608
You're a very strange person.

361
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:25,608
All I'm saying is your
days here are numbered.

362
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,608
You've got other places to go.

363
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:31,608
Yeah.

364
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:34,608
Can we just keep dancing?

365
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,608
Of course.

366
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:41,609
You can do anything you want.

367
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:09,610
I really want to go dancing, Wes.

368
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,608
It's late.

369
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:15,610
Sometimes they play music from
the eighties, come on.

370
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,608
You might even have a good time.

371
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:19,610
The eighties.

372
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:21,609
How can you not like eighties music?

373
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,609
It's like super-positive and
full of energy, like woohoo!

374
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,611
- Come on, it will be super-fun.
- I don't know.

375
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:30,610
Yeah. You need to see a
little Montreal nightlife.

376
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,610
Come on, please... Please, please, please.

377
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:34,616
Look, he's driving.

378
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:39,616
It's not a trick, he's really driving.

379
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:42,617
- Am I supposed to laugh?
- Yeah.

380
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:45,616
- It's not funny.
- Come on!

381
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:50,618
OK, look, he can also shift gears.

382
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:55,617
Ready... go!

383
00:38:58,617 --> 00:38:59,616
Wes!

384
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,618
OK, stop screwing around.

385
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,617
It's really dangerous.

386
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:11,617
It is so not even funny.

387
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:14,617
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not. It's time to grow up.

388
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,619
You grow up.

389
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:20,618
Oh boy, you must've been such a
little prat when you were a kid.

390
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:23,618
I bet your mum had a nice liqueur cabinet.

391
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:26,618
I was an adorable little
person when I was a kid.

392
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:32,617
I can totally see you walking around at
school with your fingers up your nose.

393
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:36,617
Making faces... thinking you're the
king of things that are kind of funny

394
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:40,618
except they're not. Did
your little friends laugh?

395
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:45,618
Yeah, Abby... she had really thick
glasses and was kind of shy.

396
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,619
Kids are evil. I was pretty shy too.
Especially at high-school.

397
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:57,618
I could never talk to boys, I
was always too intimidated.

398
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:00,619
- They were so big.
- Yeah, I was kind of small.

399
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,618
Wes, stop it! I'm serious,
it's really dangerous.

400
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,618
Take it easy, mama bear.

401
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,620
What if a big gasoline truck drives
by and your little friend gets nervous?

402
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,620
Then what?

403
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:24,620
Boom! Barbecue time!

404
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,620
Is that bacon cooking? Oh no!
It's your face!

405
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,619
You're hurting his feelings.
What did he ever do to you?

406
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
Aw!

407
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
- What are you doing?
- Relax!

408
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:43,621
You relax. Keep your eyes on the road.

409
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:46,620
It will only take a second.

410
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:51,619
It's totally safe, trust me.

411
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,621
Wes, I am not kidding. You stay right here.

412
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:22,622
Can you imagine living out here?
Like... what do you do?

413
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:26,622
Just live, I guess.

414
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,622
Do you think they're happy?

415
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,621
- People who live here?
- Yeah.

416
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:36,622
I don't know. In what way?

417
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,622
Do you think they feel
warm and bubbly inside

418
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,622
when they wake up in the morning?

419
00:41:43,622 --> 00:41:45,622
And how about when they die...

420
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:48,622
I mean just before they do, when
they take their last breath...

421
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:51,622
Do you think they're happy then?

422
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:54,623
At peace with everything they've done?

423
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:03,623
Do you ever exercise? You know like...
do yoga or anything.

424
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:08,624
Yoga? What do you know about yoga?

425
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:11,623
- I read about it.
- 'Read' doesn't count.

426
00:42:12,623 --> 00:42:14,624
Yeah, it does, books are great.

427
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:17,623
Well, maybe you should write one?

428
00:42:17,624 --> 00:42:20,622
Like a collection of
little jokes or something.

429
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:23,624
I did... I wrote a book seven years ago.
Serious one.

430
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:26,622
Get out!

431
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:30,624
You have to stop the car first otherwise
it would be very dangerous.

432
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:35,624
- And we wouldn't want that.
- Wes... you're not funny.

433
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,624
Stop trying to make it happen...
it's not happening.

434
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,624
It's so happening, Alison,
in like different dimension.

435
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,624
You should join us, it's a lot of fun.

436
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:47,625
Why do you always say 'Alison' when
you talk to me? I know I'm Alison.

437
00:42:48,624 --> 00:42:51,624
You just said 'Alison' when when you
talked to me like 30 seconds ago.

438
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,623
Yeah, but I almost never do it.

439
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:56,624
You, on the other hand,
seem to be on a mission

440
00:42:56,625 --> 00:43:01,624
to make sure I never forget my name.
I'm Alison, I know, thanks.

441
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,625
You're welcome.

442
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:11,625
- What was your book about?
- I'm not telling you.

443
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,625
- Oh, come on, tell me.
- No.

444
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,626
- Can I read it?
- No.

445
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:22,625
- You suck.
- Thank you.

446
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:25,627
Come on, what is it about?

447
00:43:28,626 --> 00:43:30,626
- Penguins.
- Penguins?

448
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:35,625
Yeah. In a world of penguins it's a
big book, I sold a lot of copies.

449
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,627
I'm like expert when it comes to penguins.

450
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:40,626
- Really?
- Yeah.

451
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:45,626
I don't believe you.

452
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,627
- Come on, penguins?
- Yeah.

453
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:57,627
You're lying.

454
00:44:22,628 --> 00:44:24,628
No more.

455
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,628
I'm so hungry.

456
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:36,628
What do you want to eat?

457
00:44:37,628 --> 00:44:39,629
- Don't you ever sleep?
- Not really.

458
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:46,628
How about pasta? It sounds great!
With cheese.

459
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:49,629
What's your favourite kind of cheese?

460
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,629
Did you have fun?

461
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,628
Yes, I did.

462
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:02,629
Me too.

463
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:04,629
Hey, sweetie.

464
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:07,629
Hello, cat.

465
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:10,629
How old are you?

466
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,629
Payaso. He's four years old.

467
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,630
- Payaso?
- Yeah, isn't that a cool name?

468
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:22,629
When Kai gave it to me
it was like this big.

469
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,628
Tiny, tiny.

470
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:28,630
It was my birthday gift. I
cried for five minutes.

471
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,630
Payaso, I like it.

472
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,631
Kai said it meant 'hope' when
he gave it to me.

473
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,630
In Japanese, you know.

474
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,629
He was making a joke.

475
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,631
Doesn't really mean anything in Japanese.

476
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,631
His English is kind of funny.

477
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,630
- It means 'clown' in Spanish, right?
- Yeah.

478
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:58,631
Still a cute name for a cat.
You're so cute.

479
00:46:01,631 --> 00:46:03,630
I'm really hungry.

480
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:08,632
How about cucumber sandwiches with jelly?

481
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:13,631
My favourite, no thanks.

482
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:16,630
Fine, I'm going to make
one just for myself.

483
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:18,632
And once I start eating, you'll
be like 'oh, can I have a bite?'

484
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:21,630
and I'll be like 'no' and you're
going to be like 'oh, come on'

485
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:24,632
and you're going to eat the whole sandwich.

486
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:34,632
That's kind of rude.

487
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:42,632
Hello? What about chocolate?

488
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:51,633
What about you? Do you want some chocolate?

489
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:24,634
Are you ready?

490
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,633
Oh yeah, it's now or never, baby.

491
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:32,634
Just remember - don't open
your eyes during transport.

492
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:34,634
- Why not?
- Because you'll die.

493
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:36,634
Got it.

494
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:39,634
- See that circle over there?
- Yeah.

495
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:41,634
What you're going to do

496
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:44,633
is you're going to close your
eyes and concentrate real hard.

497
00:47:44,634 --> 00:47:46,634
Then you're going to let everything go.
And I do mean everything.

498
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:51,635
That is the key right there. And
don't worry about the 'champ'.

499
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:55,633
- 'Champ'?
- Yeah, it's going to go 'champ'.

500
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:58,634
- Are you sure this is safe?
- Just don't open your eyes.

501
00:47:58,635 --> 00:48:02,635
And don't look at the dog. We
don't want to freak him out.

502
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:09,634
Sure, let's take good care of the dog.
We like the dog. The dog is important.

503
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:11,635
He's the center of attention. He's special.

504
00:48:11,636 --> 00:48:16,636
Look, you're starting to upset the dog.
Hurry up.

505
00:48:17,635 --> 00:48:19,636
I've upset the dog. Great.

506
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:41,636
Wow! Did you see that? I can fly!

507
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:45,635
That is technically incorrect.

508
00:48:45,636 --> 00:48:48,636
You can travel through space at
ridiculously fast speed.

509
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,637
Subatomic level. Which is
not bad, not bad at all.

510
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:56,635
But it's not flying. Not exactly.

511
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,637
Come, I can fly. Say it.

512
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:02,637
For all intents and purposes,

513
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:07,636
yes... you have achieved paranormal
transportation.

514
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:09,637
Woohoo!

515
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:39,639
So what is exactly the
second law of thermodynamics?

516
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,638
- You don't want to know.
- Tell me!

517
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:46,638
It's really about the transfer of energy.

518
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:51,638
Like when air escapes the punctured
tire because the pressure outside the tire

519
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:54,638
is a lot lower than the
pressure inside the tire.

520
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,638
That kind of stuff.

521
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,639
Energy's changing from being
localized to being more spread out.

522
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:05,639
- It's really cool.
- Yeah, it's fascinating.

523
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:11,639
- I told you it was boring.
- No, it's kind of cool. Really.

524
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,639
Just shut up.

525
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,639
- Do you like this color?
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.

526
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,639
Don't make fun of me.

527
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
I like it, really. It brings out your eyes.

528
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:28,640
- You're making fun of me.
- It's really beautiful.

529
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,639
If I were to paint my toe
nails and I had your eyes,

530
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,640
that's the color I'd choose.
No doubt about it.

531
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,641
- You don't have any cigarettes, do you?
- No.

532
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,640
It's so crazy but I would totally sell
my soul for a cigarette right now.

533
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,640
Just one, you know.

534
00:50:54,641 --> 00:50:57,641
- I thought you stopped smoking.
- I did, that's why I want them.

535
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,641
Sometimes I wonder how you ever
made it past kindergarten, Wes.

536
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:11,641
Maybe you should think about... melons.

537
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:16,641
- Melons?
- Yeah, watermelons.

538
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:22,641
- I keep forgetting how weird you are.
- I think watermelons could help you.

539
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:26,641
I mean, why would you want to smoke,

540
00:51:26,642 --> 00:51:28,642
when you can be thinking about watermelons?

541
00:51:29,642 --> 00:51:31,641
They're the perfect distraction.

542
00:51:31,642 --> 00:51:36,642
They're colorful, they're filled with
water and other natural stuff...

543
00:51:37,643 --> 00:51:39,642
They're good for you, you know.

544
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:44,641
It makes no sense at all.
It's a freaking fruit.

545
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:48,642
- I want a cigarette.
- I was only trying to help you.

546
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:51,642
Never mind, have your freaking cigarette.

547
00:51:51,643 --> 00:51:53,642
I don't smoke any more.

548
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,643
So why are you thinking about cigarettes?

549
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,643
Because I don't smoke any more.

550
00:52:00,643 --> 00:52:02,643
- I'm not weird.
- Right.

551
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:06,643
I'm good at this.

552
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:08,643
Yeah, let's not discuss why.

553
00:52:09,643 --> 00:52:13,642
It's kind of fun. I bet
that's why you guys do it.

554
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:16,643
Oh, yeah. My sisters and I,

555
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:20,643
we get together like all the time and
we have hours of fun with this stuff.

556
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:23,643
Hours! And then we get naked and make out.

557
00:52:32,644 --> 00:52:35,644
I'm glad you quit smoking.
It's very mature of you.

558
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:43,645
Watermelons. It's the dumbest thing I've
ever heard. You should get a medal.

559
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:49,645
I should get a medal.

560
00:52:51,644 --> 00:52:54,645
- You're doing a pretty good job.
- I know.

561
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:23,646
I'm taking this one.

562
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:27,646
- You do that every night.
- Yes I do.

563
00:53:34,647 --> 00:53:39,647
Sleep is such a fantastic thing.
It's one of life's little treasures.

564
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:45,647
Chocolate chip cookie are pretty cool too.

565
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:51,647
- Long day...
- It was fun.

566
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,646
Yeah... I really like driving.
I never get tired of it.

567
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:01,647
It's very zen... like shaving your legs.

568
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:03,647
I know exactly what you mean.

569
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:13,648
- Aren't there a lot of Mormons in Utah?
- I think so, I'm not sure.

570
00:54:15,647 --> 00:54:19,648
- Have we seen any?
- I don't know. What do they look like?

571
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:24,648
Like farmers from the 50's.
Something like that.

572
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:31,648
I think we've seen a few, I
wasn't paying attention.

573
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,648
We are going to sleep like babies.

574
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,648
Where's the remote?

575
00:54:51,649 --> 00:54:55,649
- There's like nothing on TV.
- So turn it off.

576
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,650
- Sexy.
- I know.

577
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:25,649
Total soy complex. Oat proteins?

578
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,649
- You're so annoying.
- No, I'm not.

579
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,650
Yes, you are. You're like a little girl.

580
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,650
That's right.

581
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:40,650
Skin silkening soy extract.

582
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:45,650
You get bored so easily, Alison.

583
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:49,651
- That's kind of fun.
- It is not fun.

584
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,651
Yes it is. It's interesting.

585
00:55:57,651 --> 00:56:00,650
You always have to be doing
something or talking about something.

586
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:01,651
What do you mean?

587
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:06,651
I don't know, you really
like to talk, like a lot.

588
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:10,653
It's not that bad.

589
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:13,650
- You talk to payaso?
- Sometimes.

590
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:18,651
- Does he listen?
- She listens, she's a girl.

591
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:23,650
But sometimes she just
hides under the sofa.

592
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:28,652
- Maybe she's running away from you?
- No, she's not. She loves me.

593
00:56:32,652 --> 00:56:36,651
Do you want to get drunk? Goes
really well with being bored.

594
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:39,652
Like going to the car wash or
playing strip-poker.

595
00:56:40,652 --> 00:56:42,652
I'm not bored.

596
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,653
But if you want to get drunk,
I'll definitely join you.

597
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,652
Sounds like a lot of fun.

598
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:51,652
Don't forget the eyelids. It's
where I need it the most.

599
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:54,653
It's like super important.

600
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:59,653
- Happy?
- Yes, thank you.

601
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:02,653
You're welcome.

602
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:18,653
Hey, it's me. It's like midnight.

603
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:26,654
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

604
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:29,654
We stopped by this canyon,
it was really quiet.

605
00:57:31,654 --> 00:57:35,654
Yeah? Did you have fun?

606
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,655
Yeah, what else did you do?

607
00:57:43,654 --> 00:57:45,655
That's great.

608
00:57:46,655 --> 00:57:49,655
Yeah? Oh, I don't know.

609
00:57:50,655 --> 00:57:52,654
You worked really hard.
I think you'll get it.

610
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:55,655
Yeah, don't worry.

611
00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:00,656
Oh, guess what? We might
stop in Las Vegas tomorrow.

612
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:03,655
How cool would that be, huh?

613
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:06,655
Yeah, I know.

614
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:12,656
Yeah, OK. Goodnight.

615
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:18,656
Me too. I love you.

616
00:58:21,656 --> 00:58:23,656
OK. Bye.

617
01:01:17,662 --> 01:01:22,662
(Speaking Japanese)

618
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:25,663
It was so quiet that
afternoon by the canyon.

619
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:29,664
I could have stayed there forever.

620
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:36,664
I kind of did.

621
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:45,665
You're so interesting, Wes. It's
like time doesn't matter to you.

622
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:51,665
Are you kidding me? Things go by so fast.
I don't get it.

623
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:57,665
Yeah, but it doesn't freak you out.
You're so patient, so calm.

624
01:02:58,664 --> 01:03:02,664
There are plenty of moments where I
want just kick things and scream.

625
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:04,666
- Trust me.
- I don't know...

626
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:13,666
I mean sometimes you're really quiet and
you get this look on your face like...

627
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,665
Time doesn't exist.

628
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,666
That's how you make me feel.

629
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:26,665
Like I've all the time in the
world because time doesn't exist.

630
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:29,666
It's nice.

631
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,666
Thank you.

632
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:36,667
You're welcome.

633
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:44,666
I think I want to have a baby.

634
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:48,667
- With me?
- No.

635
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:51,667
With Kai?

636
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:59,667
I don't like change.
It's very disorienting.

637
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:05,667
I mean when something changes in
your life, you have to adapt.

638
01:04:05,668 --> 01:04:07,667
Which means you have to change.

639
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:11,666
And what if I like the way I
am and I don't want to change?

640
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:13,668
Then don't. You don't have to.

641
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:19,667
Sometimes I can't even
tell if I'm moving forward

642
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:22,667
or if I'm like frozen.

643
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:27,668
It makes me feel like I'm
not in control of my life.

644
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:31,668
It's not that bad. Being vulnerable.

645
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,668
You should care about things, about people.

646
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:39,668
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- It's kind of scary, don't you think?

647
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,668
Doesn't have to be.

648
01:04:42,669 --> 01:04:43,669
And being scared doesn't
mean you're in bad situation.

649
01:04:44,668 --> 01:04:45,669
It just means new things are
coming your way.

650
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:48,668
Depends on how you see the future I guess.

651
01:04:48,669 --> 01:04:50,668
What do you mean?

652
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:59,668
Do you see it as this thing
far, far away, full of ideals

653
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:02,668
and wonderful, impossible things?

654
01:05:02,669 --> 01:05:07,669
Or do you see it as the next hour?
The next morning?

655
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:12,668
- Does it really matter?
- I think so.

656
01:05:12,669 --> 01:05:15,669
One definitely feels better than the other.

657
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:17,670
I think that's what matters.

658
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,670
Do you think these moments will
stay with us for a long time?

659
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:36,670
You think we'll still be talking like
this in 5 years? In 10? In 20?

660
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,670
I hope so.

661
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,671
I don't want to lose what we have.

662
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,671
I'm sorry I can't offer you more.

663
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,671
In a night I dreamt I was lying in
the middle of busy road...

664
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,670
… And I was suffocating.

665
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:11,672
Dying like a fish off the water.

666
01:06:13,672 --> 01:06:14,671
Ouch.

667
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:20,671
Nobody would help me, I mean people would
just walk by and not see me,

668
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:22,672
like I didn't exist.

669
01:06:24,672 --> 01:06:25,671
What do you think it means?

670
01:06:27,672 --> 01:06:30,672
- What do you think it means?
- I don't know.

671
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:35,672
And the funny thing is in
the middle of the dream

672
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:36,672
this red car shows up.

673
01:06:37,672 --> 01:06:39,671
And these two ladies come
out and offer to help me.

674
01:06:39,672 --> 01:06:42,672
Only now I'm the one who can't see them.

675
01:06:43,672 --> 01:06:46,672
I thought if it's the
world that I'm dreaming,

676
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,671
I could see what's going on.

677
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:51,673
I mean I could see them... the two girls...

678
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:56,672
So I start yelling at the other me.
The one who's dying.

679
01:06:56,673 --> 01:07:01,672
I'm like: 'Hey, idiot!
Check out two lesbians.

680
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:05,672
They want to help you. Hey! Hello!

681
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:09,673
Check out two lesbians in the Camaro, man!
They want to help'.

682
01:07:11,673 --> 01:07:13,674
How weird is that, huh?

683
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:25,674
- You were dying, huh?
- Yeah, suffocating.

684
01:07:52,675 --> 01:07:54,674
I can't believe you can buy
watermelon sat this hour.

685
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,674
It's L.A. You can buy a
Ferrari at this hour.

686
01:07:57,675 --> 01:08:00,675
No you can't.What are you talking about?

687
01:08:01,675 --> 01:08:03,675
- It's an expression.
- An expression?

688
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:06,675
What do you know anyway?

689
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:09,675
Have you ever tried to buy a
Ferrari in Los Angeles at 3 A.M.?

690
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:12,674
- No. Maybe we should try?
- Yeah, that would be funny.

691
01:08:12,675 --> 01:08:15,676
We would show up with watermelon and
like 'hey, do you take visa?'.

692
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:25,676
- Nice pajamas.
- Thanks.

693
01:08:26,676 --> 01:08:28,675
It's very feng-shui of
her, don't you think?

694
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:32,676
Spices up the whole place, brings
up the positive energy, you know.

695
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:34,675
I bet you're going to have a great night.

696
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:36,676
No armed robberies, that's for sure.

697
01:08:38,677 --> 01:08:40,676
It's pretty, I like it.

698
01:08:43,677 --> 01:08:45,676
50 dollars.

699
01:08:47,677 --> 01:08:48,677
Really?

700
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:52,677
- Yes.
- For a watermelon?

701
01:08:53,677 --> 01:08:55,676
Seedless watermelon.

702
01:09:05,678 --> 01:09:07,677
Are you sure you don't have any
cigarettes hidden somewhere?

703
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:13,677
I'm absolutely 100% certain
of that, yes. Sorry.

704
01:09:15,678 --> 01:09:19,677
It's OK. It's only an addiction.
You can beat that.

705
01:09:31,678 --> 01:09:32,678
You should probably get
a few hours of sleep

706
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:34,678
before you go to the airport, huh?

707
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:38,679
Yeah.

708
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,678
You can take my bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

709
01:11:45,683 --> 01:11:47,682
I'm glad I called.

710
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:50,683
Yeah, I wish you didn't have to leave.

711
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:52,683
Me too.

712
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:55,683
In another life maybe.

713
01:11:57,683 --> 01:11:58,683
Yeah, maybe.

714
01:12:03,683 --> 01:12:05,682
You know I don't mind if you want to stay.

715
01:12:05,683 --> 01:12:06,683
We can share the bed.

716
01:12:06,684 --> 01:12:09,683
If you promise you won't get
weird after I fall asleep.

717
01:12:09,684 --> 01:12:11,683
Don't try to lick my feet or something.

718
01:12:15,684 --> 01:12:18,684
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Come on.

719
01:12:51,686 --> 01:12:57,685
If you could be a fish... any fish...
What would it be?

720
01:12:58,685 --> 01:13:02,685
Ssh... Wes, you talk too much.

721
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:06,685
- I do?
- When you're nervous, yeah.

722
01:13:14,685 --> 01:13:15,686
A dolphin.

723
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:19,686
What?

724
01:13:21,686 --> 01:13:23,685
I'd want to be a dolphin.

725
01:13:25,686 --> 01:13:28,686
Dolphins are mammals. I asked for a fish.

726
01:13:30,686 --> 01:13:34,686
Well, I'd still want to be a dolphin.

727
01:13:38,687 --> 01:13:39,687
Good choice.

728
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:48,687
Goodnight.

729
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:54,687
Goodnight.

730
01:13:57,687 --> 01:13:59,686
All right. We play now.

731
01:13:59,687 --> 01:14:00,687
We play now!

732
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:05,687
Suicide kings and one-eyed Jacks.

733
01:14:07,688 --> 01:14:08,687
That's a little wild.

734
01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:10,687
- How many cards is that?
- 5.

735
01:14:10,688 --> 01:14:12,688
- Really?
- That's enough.

736
01:14:14,687 --> 01:14:17,687
All right there, Sonny,
what are you going to bet?

737
01:14:17,688 --> 01:14:21,688
Ma'am, I'll bet you one
pair of denim jeans.

738
01:14:22,688 --> 01:14:27,689
Excellent choice. And I will
bet one black negligee.

739
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:31,687
Woooohoo!

740
01:14:31,688 --> 01:14:33,687
Lay them down.

741
01:14:33,688 --> 01:14:36,688
Pair of sixes. Read them and weep.

742
01:14:37,689 --> 01:14:40,689
You can't beat it. You can't beat it.

743
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:43,688
Pair of aces.

744
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,689
Take them off.

745
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,688
- I'm stuck.
- You need some help.

746
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:55,689
I'm stuck.

747
01:15:00,689 --> 01:15:02,689
I win.

748
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:07,689
This is so much fun.

749
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,689
It's like my favourite game.

750
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:13,690
Do you want to dance?'Cause I
feel like Ricky Martin's Cd.

751
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:18,690
- You're so weird.
- Yes, I am.

752
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:26,690
- Good for you.
- Yeah, good for me.

753
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:27,692
Hey!

754
01:16:28,692 --> 01:16:30,692
I'll catch you later.

755
01:17:15,694 --> 01:17:18,693
I'm going to catch up with you guys later.
I'll talk to Chad.

756
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:24,693
- He's hilarious.
- I know. He's great, right?

757
01:17:24,694 --> 01:17:27,694
He's so weird. But good weird.

758
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:32,694
See you later.

759
01:18:18,696 --> 01:18:20,696
Misha?

760
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:26,696
Hello?

761
01:18:27,696 --> 01:18:29,696
Are you dead?

762
01:18:39,697 --> 01:18:43,696
Misha, it's time to go home.

763
01:18:44,697 --> 01:18:50,697
(Speaking French)

764
01:19:00,697 --> 01:19:02,697
I think he'll be fine.

765
01:19:31,698 --> 01:19:33,698
Come on, sweetie.

766
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:52,699
I love it. I'm so drunk.

767
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:59,699
Me too.

768
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:04,700
You looked really pretty tonight.

769
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:10,700
I don't know if it's the
martinis talking or what but...

770
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:14,700
You were really hot.

771
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:21,699
I was like... Mhmm... all night.

772
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,701
- Pig.
- Bite me.

773
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,700
You wish.

774
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:33,700
- You're funny.
- I know.

775
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:44,700
Goodnight, Johnny deep.

776
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,702
Goodnight.

777
01:22:08,703 --> 01:22:13,702
Sleep is such a funny thing. Our
body is like so sophisticated.

778
01:22:13,703 --> 01:22:17,703
Machine complex beyond our
wildest imagination.

779
01:22:17,704 --> 01:22:22,704
It feels, it loves, suffers,
it can even replicate itself.

780
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:26,704
But it only works half of the time.

781
01:22:27,704 --> 01:22:30,703
Do you think whoever'll build
a machine like that one day?

782
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:33,705
Something really cool that
only works half the time?

783
01:22:35,704 --> 01:22:38,704
Yes, one day when we understand.

784
01:22:41,704 --> 01:22:43,703
Why is it that when you're a kid

785
01:22:43,704 --> 01:22:45,704
you always wake up super
early in the morning?

786
01:22:45,705 --> 01:22:47,704
And then you grow up and
it's hard to wake up.

787
01:22:48,705 --> 01:22:51,705
And then when you're really old you
go back to waking up early.

788
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:57,704
I don't know.

789
01:22:58,705 --> 01:23:01,705
That's something you're going have
to find out on your own.

790
01:23:02,706 --> 01:23:04,705
But I like your thinking.

791
01:23:09,705 --> 01:23:10,705
Goodbye.

792
01:23:14,705 --> 01:23:15,705
Goodbye.

793
01:23:43,706 --> 01:23:46,707
Hi. I'm Alison.

794
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:53,706
Wes. Nice to meet you.

795
01:23:56,707 --> 01:23:58,707
What are you doing out here?

796
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:03,707
I'm dreaming.

797
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:05,708
Really?

798
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,707
Everything feels so real.

799
01:24:11,707 --> 01:24:12,707
I know.

800
01:26:27,712 --> 01:26:29,712
Wes?

801
01:26:36,712 --> 01:26:39,713
This is a bad idea. I shouldn't be here.

802
01:26:42,712 --> 01:26:43,713
I'm going to go back on my own.

803
01:26:45,713 --> 01:26:49,713
- You don't have to.
- I know. I want to.

804
01:26:51,713 --> 01:26:52,713
Why?

805
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:58,713
I don't know.

806
01:27:02,714 --> 01:27:04,713
I shouldn't have come in a first place.

807
01:27:07,714 --> 01:27:08,713
Don't say that.

808
01:27:10,713 --> 01:27:12,714
Yeah.

809
01:29:03,717 --> 01:29:05,718
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

810
01:29:12,717 --> 01:29:13,718
What?

811
01:29:23,718 --> 01:29:24,718
What?

812
01:29:30,718 --> 01:29:32,718
The airport is closed.

813
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:07,719
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

814
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,720
Alright, thank you.

815
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:29,720
They don't really know. I have
to call back later today.

816
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,719
If they've done an
underground supersonic train,

817
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,719
you know like super-fast train

818
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,721
that can go anywhere in
the world super-fast...

819
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,722
You could take that to go home. It
would be super-comfortable too.

820
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:47,720
See, Wes, you're always so calm.

821
01:30:48,721 --> 01:30:50,721
I like snow.

822
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:56,721
I had this dream last night.
It was really beautiful.

823
01:30:57,721 --> 01:30:58,721
Yeah?

824
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:01,721
I was living on this
planet where all you could do

825
01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:05,721
is eat chocolate and make love.
It was pretty cool.

826
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:08,721
Why was it so beautiful?

827
01:31:08,722 --> 01:31:12,723
The sun was blue... like really blue.
Not orange.

828
01:31:13,722 --> 01:31:16,721
The sky was orange but the sun was
blue and the night was pink

829
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:19,721
- bright pink. And the stars were green.

830
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:24,722
And people were happy. And there
were lots of bunnies. Tons.

831
01:31:25,721 --> 01:31:28,722
I don't ever want to hear
you saying weird again.

832
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:43,722
How come you have no
pictures of me on the walls?

833
01:31:44,723 --> 01:31:47,722
- I took them off.
- You should put them back.

834
01:31:48,722 --> 01:31:50,723
- I will.
- Promise me.

835
01:31:52,723 --> 01:31:54,723
I promise.

836
01:31:56,723 --> 01:31:57,723
Wait, don't move.

837
01:32:05,723 --> 01:32:07,723
Say 'happy cows make happy cheese'.

838
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:18,724
It's really good. You look
all cute and everything.
