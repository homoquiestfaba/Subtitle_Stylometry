1
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:18,229
<i>In the second age the War of Gods intensified.</i>

2
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:21,276
<i>As battles raged and the
Gods ravaged the land,</i>

3
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:24,717
<i>survivors became few and scattered.</i>

4
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:26,571
<i>The Humans forged the Order,</i>

5
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:29,442
<i>a desperate alliance with Elves and Dwarves.</i>

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:34,088
<i>This ended the war, forcing the Orcs
and Dark Elves deep into the wastelands.</i>

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,961
<i>As the Order struggled to restore civilization</i>

8
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:41,033
<i>the Prophets were tormented by
visions of a growing darkness in the West.</i>

9
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:44,717
<i>An ancient evil rekindled...</i>

10
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:47,817
<i>In the dim corners of taverns and caverns</i>

11
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:52,702
<i>whisperings were heard of a syndicate
of conspirators known as the Shadow.</i>

12
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:56,606
<i>In the lawless borderlands between
Battle Grave and Waspire</i>

13
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:59,199
<i>operatives of the Shadow emerged.</i>

14
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,414
<i>The prophets dispatched agents
of their own to uncover the origin</i>

15
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:07,404
<i>and intentions of the Shadow Cabal.</i>

16
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:21,470
You've been busy, Fang-Tor Bloodmoon.

17
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:27,053
Murder, rape, arson,
desecration of a Holy Relic.

18
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:34,440
I have gold. Walk away.

19
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,295
And I'll give you double.

20
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:59,416
We don't need it.
We do, we do need...

21
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:03,230
What, who's there?

22
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,841
Is that you, Gyarmuck?
- What does he want?

23
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:10,527
I'll have some words with you.

24
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,838
You've been tracking me, Keltus.

25
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,787
The gods be damned!
Order sent you.

26
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:36,824
I need some answers.
- I answer to no one

27
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,163
but the Shadow now.

28
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:42,084
That answers at least two of my questions.

29
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:50,161
You have come a long way
for me, Keltus.

30
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,355
Loyal lapdog of the Prophetess!

31
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,448
They say you're hard
to kill. For a human.

32
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,688
But Humans can't see in
the dark, can they?

33
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,402
No, but I can hear a loud
mouthed Dwarf well enough.

34
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,395
I'd rather not kill you,
I need information.

35
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:45,637
The Order hangs by a thread, Keltus.

36
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:50,876
Take up with the Rising Shadow.
Join our cause!

37
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,743
Your part is said.

38
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:57,435
Now tell me, why the Shadow is
gathering here in the North

39
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,860
and the identity of your contact.

40
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,347
In a few days, the God
of Death will awaken

41
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,984
and then you will have your answers.

42
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,822
My Lady is impatient, Dwarf.

43
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:14,074
Now, tell me or die.
- Die?

44
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:19,050
You fear death.
I only fear its master.

45
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,773
I'm going to tell you nothing.

46
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:26,305
So be it!
Give my regards to your master.

47
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:48,754
The Shadow grows with
every life that is taken.

48
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:53,136
When Kullimon's raiders
bring us the vessel

49
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:58,054
not even the Gods will
stand against our power.

50
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,254
Kullimon's raiders?
Thank you.

51
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,647
That's just what I needed to know.

52
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:08,595
You're welcome. Now die!

53
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:11,541
In pieces!

54
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,692
Oh! Gee.

55
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,340
<font color="#ffff00">Against my will</font>

56
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:05,708
<font color="#ffff00">Mulgrut has raided for
an agent of the Shadow.</font>

57
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,490
<font color="#ffff00">An enemy of the clan!</font>

58
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,642
<font color="#ffff00">A needless provocation.</font>

59
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,279
<font color="#ffff00">Now revenge is upon us.</font>

60
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,031
<font color="#ffff00">The raid is over.</font>

61
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,750
<font color="#ffff00">What's done is done!</font>

62
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,800
<font color="#ffff00">But the Shadow pays well for the vessel.</font>

63
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,950
<font color="#ffff00">We should join him.</font>

64
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,793
<font color="#ffff00">For wealth and power!</font>

65
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,822
<font color="#ffff00">We are warriors!
Hear my words!</font>

66
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:43,854
<font color="#ffff00">You will end as his slaves!</font>

67
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:51,192
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, we are warriors. Not
thieves and murderers!</font>

68
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:56,273
<font color="#ffff00">Mulgrut wants you to bow to
the Shadow. I know his heart.</font>

69
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,843
<font color="#ffff00">You are a weakling.</font>

70
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,464
<font color="#ffff00">We don't fight for gold!</font>

71
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:06,203
<font color="#ffff00">But for glory!</font>

72
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:20,955
<font color="#ffff00">The horde has no respect for you, Kullimon</font>

73
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:24,649
<font color="#ffff00">They are going to follow me!</font>

74
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:29,333
<font color="#ffff00">The horde is mine now.</font>

75
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:34,479
<font color="#ffff00">And mine alone!</font>

76
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:58,596
<font color="#ffff00">Those who are still faithful,
may follow me.</font>

77
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,302
<font color="#ffff00">Kill these cowards!</font>

78
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:52,388
<font color="#ffff00">To me!
To me!</font>

79
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,774
<font color="#ffff00">Seize him!</font>

80
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,859
<font color="#ffff00">On your knees!</font>

81
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:51,418
<font color="#ffff00">Are you brave enough to murder
the grandson of Mahan Shek?</font>

82
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:54,160
<font color="#ffff00">descendant of the Holy Warrior?</font>

83
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:59,722
<font color="#ffff00">This I will not do, Kullimon.</font>

84
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:04,085
<font color="#ffff00">Since a quick death is too merciful for you.</font>

85
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,520
What information did you take from the Dwarf?

86
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:02,872
He spoke of a vessel, Prophetess!
To be delivered by Kullimon.

87
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:07,639
An Orc raider.
We've crossed paths before.

88
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,166
The Dwarf also spoke of the power of Goth Azul.

89
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,298
The God of Death!
Do not speak his name.

90
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,201
The other Gods are seeking
a return to our world

91
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,243
as our Goddess feared.

92
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,431
They must not succeed!

93
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:25,933
Lest the world be ravaged by
chaos in a new war of Gods.

94
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,538
If the Death God is unleashed
from the underworld

95
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,995
all things living shall perish.
- Tell me where to go, prophetess.

96
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:39,900
The general called Drennon has an agent
of the Shadow in his dungeon.

97
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:43,961
Spare no method in extracting
answers from him.

98
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,384
You must not fail this.

99
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,998
A package for field general Drennon.
- Leave your weapons.

100
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:33,080
Why?
- Leave your weapons or leave the outpost!

101
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,344
This is his head, I take it?
- It is.

102
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,859
He'll have to be identified.

103
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:10,929
400 gold coins. That is what was promised.
Do not cheat me, Human!

104
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:15,717
For the full 400 you'd have to take
the head to the fortress at Ang-Kirk.

105
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,166
And that is a long road.

106
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:22,054
One not friendly to Elven kind.

107
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:26,494
I will give you 300 and my men will take the
head to the fortress for the difference.

108
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,931
You are a ringed signatory of the Order.

109
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,747
You will give me the 400
or I will take the head.

110
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,782
And what?
You've killed him for us already.

111
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:40,660
That's well enough and I doubt you'll find
any other interested buyers for a bandit's head.

112
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,396
Bandit?
That's another thing.

113
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,603
The bounty was for Fang-Tor
Bloodmoon, the bandit.

114
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:49,919
Nobody said anything about a
dragon riding Shaman.

115
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:52,792
He gave me this as a parting gift.

116
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,986
I think I'm owed something a
little extra, don't you think?

117
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,944
Alas, for you an outcome

118
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:09,581
both unfortunate and regrettable.

119
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:13,664
The symbol itself is outlawed.
You must understand.

120
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:18,977
Get me a cleric who can get rid of this thing
before I forget what side I'm fighting for!

121
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:23,931
The mark as far as we've been able to discover
is permanent and cannot be removed.

122
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:27,493
Even with magic.
- Well, I have a problem with that.

123
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:30,522
As do I.
Seize her!

124
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,773
What?!

125
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,635
You bear the mark. An agent
of the Shadow cannot be trusted.

126
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,347
Your reward is forfeit.

127
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:23,349
I should slit you, traitor.
- Assaulting a magistrate

128
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,608
is punishable by death.
- Mine or yours?

129
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:33,591
Don't ever let a blade
through that door again.

130
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:36,900
Strip her down to her skin next time.

131
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:48,413
Oh god! Keltus, what do you want?

132
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:51,664
I have enough troubles with
bounty hunters and cultists.

133
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:54,894
I don't need the church as well,
meddling with my business.

134
00:21:56,261 --> 00:22:01,550
I'll be damned! Have some decency!
- Hail, magistrate.

135
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:09,487
Hail, Ambassador!
What is this about?

136
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,845
The Dwarves are joining
up with the Shadow now.

137
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:16,513
Elves too, from what
I've seen this morning.

138
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:19,553
That one claims she was cursed.

139
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:22,589
Did you have to drop his
bloody arm on my table?

140
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,035
You should have brought
this Dwarf to me for a trial.

141
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:28,284
Don't question my methods
and I won't report yours.

142
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:33,934
Are the hands of the Prophetess so clean
that you follow her without question?

143
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:37,150
My orders come directly from the Lady herself.

144
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,478
I have nothing to doubt
and I answer to no one.

145
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:47,155
You are young still.
With few regrets.

146
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:52,936
You have a prisoner named Maggut Guilbrow.
I need to ask him a few questions.

147
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:25,575
Beautiful flower, trapped in an ugly place.

148
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:29,310
So sweet to my lips and tongue.

149
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:47,888
Sister, you bear the mark.

150
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,492
And an elf, no less!

151
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,209
How precious!

152
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,240
Listen carefully!

153
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:02,502
There is a box,
heavy, laden with gold.

154
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:06,579
Which gold must be
taken to Garret's Crossing

155
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,829
by the second watch of the new moon.

156
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,462
If by some chance you are...

157
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:21,157
You must take our place and exchange
the gold with Kullimon's raiders

158
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:27,150
for the sacred vessel which the
Shadow sought these many years.

159
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:33,047
Where is the gold?
- In the hollow of a tree.

160
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:36,534
Just after the Bleeding
Stone you will find it.

161
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:41,175
At dawn collect the blood from the altar

162
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:45,645
to fill the vessel.
- Where is the Bleeding Stone?

163
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:53,433
You bear the mark.
Sure you know that.

164
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,379
Where is the Bleeding Stone?

165
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,328
You impostor!

166
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,720
I see you saved Drennon the trouble of an execution.
.

167
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,267
You bear the mark, yet you murder
your own Shadow brother.

168
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:04,130
Did he speak before you killed him?

169
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:11,935
I know you are cursed with the mark

170
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,969
by the Orc Shaman,
who calls himself Fang-Tor.

171
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:18,083
Right before I cut off his head.

172
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,644
Release her to me!
By authority of the Prophetess.

173
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:30,147
Tell no one Maggut Guilbrow is dead.
Burn the body.

174
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:53,711
Death, death is upon you,
wandering warrior.

175
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,496
Step aside!

176
00:26:55,716 --> 00:27:01,700
The stain of spilled blood
leaves a mark, does it not?

177
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,670
I speak of you, Keltus.

178
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:11,530
How do you know me?

179
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,546
I have seen you before,
near the temple.

180
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,079
You've come a long
way to play at riddles.

181
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:25,575
Riddles?
I meant to speak plainly.

182
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:29,437
A hero is known by his deeds

183
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,617
but judged by his heart.

184
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:37,927
Who has your heart,
Keltus, wanderer?

185
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:43,579
Friend of yours?

186
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:47,664
Come on,
there's a long way ahead of us.

187
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:31,039
You know I can help but I'm
gonna need your help first.

188
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,374
I don't need your help, Human!
- Really?

189
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,733
I freed you from execution.

190
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:19,360
I work alone and my work is
far from finished. I go South.

191
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:24,225
You know, the priestesses of the
Order can remove the mark.

192
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:27,134
It's your choice.
Maybe you'd rather see yourself decay

193
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:30,267
as the undead contagion festers in your blood.

194
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:34,189
Which it does as we speak.
- What priestesses?

195
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:36,587
Where are they?
- I serve my mistress

196
00:29:36,632 --> 00:29:39,255
the Prophetess of Ari-Alia,
I am their ambassador.

197
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,856
What do you want with me, Ambassador?
- You have the mark!

198
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,135
But unwillingly. That makes
you special, maybe even unique.

199
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,531
I need you to infiltrate the Shadow
and bring me information.

200
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:54,525
And you'll see to it that
I'm cured of this?

201
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:57,249
Yes.

202
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:01,796
Cure me first and then I'll help you.
- The priestesses are days from here.

203
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:03,736
I need your help now.

204
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:11,697
The rat-faced human
that I killed in the prison

205
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,958
told me to go to the Bleeding Stone.

206
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:18,301
The Bleeding Stone?
What did he want you to do there?

207
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,865
I'll tell you when we get there.

208
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,090
That's more than a day on foot.

209
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:40,161
You said you work alone.
Unusual for an Elf.

210
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:44,115
Where are your kin?
- I have no kin.

211
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:47,947
Your fighting style is Elahrian.
- Yes.

212
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:53,407
A High Elf then. From the Garuun-Dan.
- Yes

213
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:56,845
But surely too young to have fought in the Orc wars?

214
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,347
You are a survivor.

215
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:03,668
You know, I read the history,
the whole clans were starving.

216
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:08,662
Forced them to your forests. There was a famine.
- Bite your tongue, Orc lover.

217
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,155
Hey, I am no fan of the Orcs.
But I am no fan of Elves either.

218
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:18,433
You and I have no friends,
we share that at least.

219
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:24,459
The Bleeding Stone is on that far ridge.

220
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,202
What?

221
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:25,554
Well met, brother of the Order.
- Not so well for you, it seems, Kullimon the Black.

222
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,896
You're the one they call 'Wanderer'.

223
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:34,820
You're younger than your reputation implies.

224
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:39,078
Was it not so long ago you were a
commander of a horde of Orc raiders?

225
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,871
I may have the lost the battle
but not yet my last breath.

226
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:52,911
What's this? Your consort?

227
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,575
Surely  your prophetess frowns
upon her henchman befriending an elf.

228
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:00,146
Enough.

229
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:04,113
Now, you have the habit of killing prisoners before
I have a chance to question them.

230
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:11,851
What news from Warspire?
- Hard times, Human.

231
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,359
Good raid targets are
not easy to come by.

232
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,747
Rumor has it the monastery
was sacked just two days before.

233
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,711
Leaving many dead.

234
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,230
Sounds like a certain someone I know.

235
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,353
Cut me down and I'll tell you about it.

236
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:28,135
It was the shrine of Noc Benari.
They are monastics.

237
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:31,114
They have taken a vow of poverty.
They have nothing of value there.

238
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:35,521
Nothing of value to me or to you,
but beneath the shrine

239
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:39,357
is the tomb of Odus the Tall
and in that tomb were some artifacts.

240
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:43,629
One of which was very eagerly sought
after by an agent of the Shadow.

241
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:46,000
Which artifact?

242
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,816
Cut me down.

243
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,315
Which artifact, Kullimon?

244
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:03,547
The Bone Vessel is what they call it
- The Bone Vessel?

245
00:34:03,865 --> 00:34:08,421
It's said it holds the Ashes of Amun Khan.
It's a fake, like most relics.

246
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:12,640
Fake or not, delivered into the right hands
it's worth a small fortune in gold.

247
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:17,529
Where will the exchange take place?
- I will take you there.

248
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,771
With your wounds you are too slow.
Go back to Warspire. This is my affair now.

249
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:27,174
I too have unfinished deeds.
I go to face the horde one last time.

250
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:31,788
Kill me if you must.
I will not tell you the place.

251
00:34:32,265 --> 00:34:37,554
Go on, kill him. It is at Garret's
Crossing at new moon.

252
00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:43,302
The girl speaks truth, but there
are details of which she is unaware.

253
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:47,615
If it's the vessel you want,
you'd be fools to refuse my help.

254
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:51,183
I care nothing for this so called Bone Vessel.

255
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:56,765
I would rather saw my left arm off
and be done with the both of you

256
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:59,463
than work with this pig faced scum

257
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:04,316
Your curse! Your days
are numbered, Shadow child.

258
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:06,887
It is I who shall refuse to accompany you!

259
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:09,779
She is not controlled by the Shadow of Death.

260
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:13,578
Yet she would kill an unarmed,
wounded, kneeling opponent.

261
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:20,582
The goddess sent me to each
of you, all for a noble purpose.

262
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:28,191
It is no coincidence we will
go together to meet our fate.

263
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,212
Had enough?

264
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:38,968
There may be a time and place
for you to kill each other

265
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:42,221
but it is not here and not now.

266
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:49,122
I do not serve your Goddess and I
do not live or die by goodwill.

267
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:53,058
So long as her goals and my own are aligned

268
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:55,384
I will go with you.

269
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:58,944
I care nothing for the gods. I do as I please.

270
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,299
But I will travel with you two fools to 
the Bleeding Stone and no further.

271
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:07,428
That's for my part. Keltus will see to it
that his priestesses remove my mark.

272
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:10,820
And if I again choose to end
the life of a worthless Orc

273
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,787
do not get in my way or it
will be yours that I take.
.

274
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:21,533
To the Bleeding Stone then. We'll march
through the night if Kullimon can handle it.

275
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,453
Even dripping in blood
I out walk you, pale-skin.

276
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:49,445
There's movement out there.
I can sense it.

277
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:52,705
Yet I see no warmth
and hear no beating heart.

278
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:56,125
Not all that walks has a beating heart.

279
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:59,256
A weapon.

280
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:19,488
Thanks for your help.
- It was a puny lizard.

281
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:22,713
No match for Keltus the Wanderer.

282
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:50,088
The Bleeding Stone,
was a meeting place for the Warlocks.

283
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:54,104
Ancient worshipers of an Elder God.

284
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:57,041
Nemyt, what was it Maggut wanted you here for?

285
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:05,286
He told me to wait for the Moon Zyneth
and then to collect the blood from the stone.

286
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:08,684
This is not something my raiders care about.

287
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,543
It was not needed for the exchange.

288
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:14,742
Only the Shadow wants this blood.

289
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:17,051
We should leave it be.

290
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:22,210
The Horde was to be paid in gold.
- How much?

291
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:26,598
A thousand coins worth.
- Which we don't have.

292
00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:32,341
Nemyt, it's time to tell us everything
Maggut Guilbrow said to you in that prison.

293
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,938
He became suspicious of me when
I asked where the Bleeding Stone was.

294
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:43,600
He couldn't tell me anything
more so I killed him.

295
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,070
You should have left him for me to question.

296
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:52,497
We wait here and see if the Bleeding Stone
lives up to its name, then collect the Blood.

297
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:55,854
We may need Nemyt to pose as
a true Shadow agent before long

298
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:58,063
and the blood may
make all the difference.

299
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,533
In the meantime get some sleep.

300
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:05,758
We won't stop again before we reach Garret's Crossing.

301
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:50,203
Where is the brat?
- She left in the woods only moments ago.

302
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:07,692
Looks like she knew just when to leave.

303
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,145
Which way out of here?

304
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,523
If we can cut them down
I guess we can outrun them.

305
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:18,975
Cowards run, warriors fight.

306
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:21,884
Then we fight.

307
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,130
Too many of them!
Killing gets us nowhere!

308
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:46,055
<i>Killing is all I can offer.</i>

309
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:50,924
Let's not be too nice.

310
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,778
Attention!

311
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,575
From which hell did they come from?

312
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:09,796
They were watching all along.
When you left they closed in.

313
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:13,097
Why?
- You're one of them. That's why.

314
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:16,003
Where were you?
- I couldn't sleep.

315
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:24,568
I just saved you!
What do you want from me?

316
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:28,003
Do you think I'm evil?
You think I'm one of them?

317
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,467
I want you to tell me the truth.

318
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:33,898
The truth?
You swore to help me!

319
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:37,715
To rid me of this curse.
You tell me the truth, Keltus!

320
00:46:37,774 --> 00:46:42,422
Am I just a pawn in this game?
Can your almighty Prophetess help me?

321
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,538
Can she?!

322
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,659
Yes.

323
00:46:48,796 --> 00:46:54,142
And if she can't, then what?
- She will save you.

324
00:46:58,365 --> 00:47:02,128
This, this isn't me.

325
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,420
They did this to me and
I'm gonna make them pay.

326
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:12,406
And I believe you can, Nemyt.
If you can resist long enough!

327
00:47:25,606 --> 00:47:28,906
Enough! We must leave!

328
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:35,382
To Garret's Crossing. Now!
Before the next night falls.

329
00:48:40,913 --> 00:48:44,767
Human flesh is weak.
My wounds from that damn cross

330
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:50,154
are just old scars.
- The flesh is weak, but the mind is sharp.

331
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:55,119
The mind too is weak.
You have feelings for the Elf brat.

332
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:58,832
She is fighting the curse.
Even you must admire her strength.

333
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:02,727
Her heart is black or the curse
would not have taken to her.

334
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:07,177
The Shadow has claim only on souls
blinded by murder and hatred.

335
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,200
She was cursed as she killed
Fang-Tor Bloodmoon.

336
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:12,724
The Shaman lord?

337
00:49:14,176 --> 00:49:19,748
I suspected she was in league with the Shadow.
It was he who poisoned Mulgrut's mind.

338
00:49:20,905 --> 00:49:23,093
I owe her debt for killing him.

339
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:25,814
And now she's cursed because of it.

340
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:32,383
And there's one other thing.
She was a child of the Garuun-Dan.

341
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:36,942
I should have known.
- She is consumed with vengeance.

342
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:45,728
The skies were free of rain these years.
The clans were starving.

343
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:51,510
We went to the woods many times, to survive.
We wanted food, nothing more.

344
00:49:51,808 --> 00:49:54,859
The Elves were hidden in the trees.

345
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:58,975
We didn't even see them as our hunters
were slain by Elven arrows.

346
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:05,758
Every party returned with diminished numbers.
Without food.

347
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:08,378
At last we gathered a war party.

348
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:11,611
And in desperation attacked the Garuun-Dan.

349
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,400
Their women fought as valiantly as the men.

350
00:50:16,669 --> 00:50:19,228
And we spared the children.

351
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:26,491
She has nothing but her revenge.
No family, no people.

352
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,549
She kills without remorse.

353
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:35,528
Is she so different from you, wanderer?
Your order is not known for its kindness.

354
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:37,971
In service of a higher purpose.

355
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:43,307
The prophetess remains pure but her servants...
they do as they must.

356
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:13,256
No one's here. We're early.

357
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:17,481
Why do we assume the Shadow hasn't
already sent an agent for the exchange?

358
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,423
As long as we are here first
it won't matter.

359
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:22,729
Keep watch!

360
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:36,120
I gotta take care of this.

361
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,665
The elf retrieved the bones.

362
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:11,038
And I will return them to
the temple for destruction.

363
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,970
And you trust her for this task?

364
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:17,560
I see no other option.

365
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:21,562
I promised her the priestesses
would cure her of the contagion

366
00:52:21,565 --> 00:52:25,038
and remove the mark.
- She is an Elven murderer.

367
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:29,337
And soon will be the servant of Goth Azul.

368
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:34,558
Her usefulness is at an end.
You will kill her.

369
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,610
I had planned to do so.

370
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:42,466
You are my loyal servant, Keltus.

371
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:08,105
None to soon. Here comes Mulgrut
my former first captain.

372
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:15,334
Good, they are early.
Nemyt, you ready?

373
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,889
As ready as I can be to face a horde of dogs.

374
00:53:21,751 --> 00:53:25,786
Hold nothing back. Mulgrut
has a keen eye for treasure.

375
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:30,419
And if something should go wrong?
- We're on our way.

376
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:34,277
You make for a small target.
- Thanks.

377
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:39,407
Beware of Mulgrut. He has a coward's
heart but a cunning mind.

378
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:43,515
If they can fear you
you will succeed.

379
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:21,092
<i>Burning field. Broken spire.</i>

380
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:26,808
<i>The coward soils his pants
as I light him on fire.</i>

381
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:35,554
The common tongue doesn't do justice.

382
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:58,994
Does the Shadow send in a child

383
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:02,316
to do with Mulgrut, the Warlord?

384
00:55:02,356 --> 00:55:03,921
And where is Kullimon the Black?

385
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:07,338
Does he send his whores
to deal with the Shadow?

386
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:14,800
Kullimon the Black is now
Kullimon the worm food.

387
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:35,838
You are a kneel fight,
barely initiated to the Shadow.

388
00:55:35,858 --> 00:55:38,763
How is it you have gone to the ...
- I have come for the vessel.

389
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:41,669
I have the payment in full.

390
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:55,306
This purse is light.

391
00:55:55,835 --> 00:55:58,484
Do not think to make a fool of me, Elf!

392
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:03,218
The Shadow cares nothing for money,
we wouldn't cheat you over a few paltry coins.

393
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,430
One thousand as agreed.

394
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:12,410
Why should I not keep your
treasure along with the vessel?

395
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:18,684
Are you fool enough to trifle with the Shadow?

396
00:56:18,748 --> 00:56:22,091
My life means nothing and now
yours hangs by a thread.

397
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:24,591
Give me the vessel!

398
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,624
Kethku, give her the vessel!
Now!

399
00:56:35,556 --> 00:56:41,134
Another day, Orc scum and I would
bleed you like the filthy pig you are.

400
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:52,356
Seize her!

401
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,647
Tell me, dark rider
does this Elf ride with you?

402
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,995
A thief and impostor!
Give me the vessel!

403
00:57:11,046 --> 00:57:15,577
No, not so fast.
She has paid the price.

404
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:17,412
How do I know...

405
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:26,111
You dare to mock?
Give me the vessel!

406
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:31,269
Kethku!

407
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,698
You lust for power,
Mulgrut the Betrayer!

408
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:46,359
And power you shall be granted!

409
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:51,804
Banded murderers and betrayers,
join with the rising Shadow

410
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:57,210
and take upon you the Power of Goth Azul.

411
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,805
Bothku Vir Otumnai Ger-Havock..

412
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:19,668
Ha, i'm immune.

413
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:34,748
At last!

414
00:58:35,935 --> 00:58:40,935
I am immortal.
We serve Goth Azul!

415
00:58:42,284 --> 00:58:45,312
Go to the Dimwood Pass.

416
00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:55,975
And now you, plaything!

417
00:58:56,089 --> 00:59:00,401
We'll make great swat.
For the horde.

418
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:04,248
Take her to Dimwood Pass.

419
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,679
I'll go after the Shadow agent.

420
00:59:17,113 --> 00:59:21,430
I must retrieve the vessel.
- And I have a vendetta to settle with the horde.

421
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:26,799
You would leave the girl to her terrible
fate after she did her part to help you?

422
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,491
My only responsibility
is to the Prophetess.

423
00:59:32,897 --> 00:59:36,162
May your enemies suffer and your friends...

424
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:40,355
May your enemies suffer.

425
01:00:17,742 --> 01:00:20,228
Prophetess, guide me.

426
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:58,710
After Mulgrut has
had his fun with you

427
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:02,251
he's promised you to me.

428
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:21,920
I've bled the Bleeding Stone
if that's what you were looking for

429
01:02:21,986 --> 01:02:26,729
Ambassador of Light,
you will give in to the Shadow.

430
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:31,064
Your soul is empty.
- You stole the ashes of Amun Khan.

431
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:34,797
I'm taking them back!
- You cannot kill me.

432
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:38,592
You belong to Goth Azul now!

433
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:28,931
Your faith is weak, your mind is doubtful.

434
01:04:29,022 --> 01:04:34,030
In death you will serve our master well.

435
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:39,499
I will never serve Goth Azul.

436
01:04:58,116 --> 01:04:59,556
Prophetess

437
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,180
Save me!

438
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:05,871
You have failed me, Keltus the Forsaken.

439
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:11,625
You are forever cursed.
The goddess remembers you no more.

440
01:06:35,717 --> 01:06:38,384
I don't lay with fish.

441
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:10,410
Play with us.
- Yes, come play with us.

442
01:07:12,345 --> 01:07:15,278
Come, play with us.

443
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:28,162
Are you not Kullimon the Brave?
Kullimon the Conqueror?

444
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:32,415
I don't have time for
this, water whore.

445
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,405
There is still fight in you, that is good.

446
01:09:15,582 --> 01:09:18,401
It means more fun for me!
- Don't touch me.

447
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:24,262
But I am Mulgrut!
Warlord Of the Battle Grave!

448
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:26,579
And Slayer of Elves.

449
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,649
I'm going to enjoy this.

450
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:43,095
Mulgrut, the horde is hungry.
They have not hunted in days.

451
01:09:43,126 --> 01:09:45,243
The hunger will pass.

452
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:51,018
The warriors, they are restless.

453
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:53,868
They ask why we must wait here.

454
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:58,332
They do not serve the Shadow.

455
01:10:00,514 --> 01:10:05,742
The horde serves at my pleasure
and my pleasure is here, in Dimwood Pass!

456
01:10:05,845 --> 01:10:10,110
Now go and muster my horde.

457
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,378
For the bloodsport.

458
01:10:14,806 --> 01:10:16,920
Horde, Pak-Chut!

459
01:10:24,615 --> 01:10:30,493
And now, my plaything...
I will teach you of much suffering!

460
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:34,891
The Horde kills for honor
in battle, Mulgrut.

461
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:39,389
Is one bound girl
the best you can do?

462
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:49,552
No! Kullimon!
It is impossible!

463
01:10:49,832 --> 01:10:53,172
How fares the Horde under
Mulgrut the Betrayer, Kethku?

464
01:10:53,173 --> 01:10:56,601
Have you spent that gold?
Have you hunted?

465
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:59,288
Have you seen victory in battle?

466
01:11:00,335 --> 01:11:02,976
Or instead have you been cursed and enslaved

467
01:11:03,095 --> 01:11:05,733
taking orders from a human master?

468
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,631
Silence him!

469
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:13,394
I challenge Mulgrut for the Horde.

470
01:11:13,905 --> 01:11:15,206
No.

471
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:18,657
You have no right to challenge.

472
01:11:18,872 --> 01:11:22,241
The Horde has already chosen between us!

473
01:11:26,295 --> 01:11:30,528
Do you fear to bite me,
Mulgrut the Cursed?

474
01:12:15,942 --> 01:12:21,072
I, Kullimon the Black,
again Master of the Horde.

475
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:27,136
But this Horde is cursed.

476
01:12:27,314 --> 01:12:30,095
A curse which I alone have escaped!

477
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:33,458
You all belong to the Shadow now!

478
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:36,235
And my revenge is complete.

479
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:49,841
Kullimon is not one of us!

480
01:12:50,819 --> 01:12:55,205
Shadow warriors, immortal brothers,

481
01:12:55,299 --> 01:12:59,831
It is I, Mulgrut,
who has power over death.

482
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:02,408
It's us!

483
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,369
What are you doing?

484
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:08,932
Now we can go.

485
01:14:12,103 --> 01:14:14,451
Kill them.

486
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,297
Move!

487
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:08,661
And here you are again, Keltus, Wanderer.

488
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:11,271
Though you're alone.

489
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,201
So very alone.

490
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:34,474
I've been watching you, Keltus,
judging you.

491
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,323
Your sword is keen.

492
01:16:38,573 --> 01:16:42,651
Your devotion is absolute,
but your heart is empty.

493
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:46,904
You can not defeat Goth Azul like that.

494
01:16:47,996 --> 01:16:49,396
Who are you?

495
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:58,011
I am your oldest friend, Keltus.

496
01:16:58,273 --> 01:17:00,938
Your only friend.

497
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:05,971
You have been cast off so I claim you as my own.

498
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,392
The Shadow rules over the dead

499
01:17:08,412 --> 01:17:12,524
but has no real power over the living.

500
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:08,124
You still feel pain.
That's a good sign.

501
01:18:14,363 --> 01:18:16,704
There. Good as new.

502
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:22,507
An old Orc healing trick!
It seals the wound shut.

503
01:18:22,593 --> 01:18:25,030
Stops the bleeding.

504
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:35,643
You touched me.

505
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:39,197
Never do that again.

506
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:45,042
I make no promises.
But I respect your request.

507
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,371
Where is Keltus?

508
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:55,334
He went after the Shadow agent.

509
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:06,177
You're surprisingly resistant to the curse.

510
01:19:06,665 --> 01:19:11,705
My kindred, they succumbed very quickly.

511
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:16,311
That is because they are weak willed pigs.

512
01:19:17,676 --> 01:19:20,666
As are all Orcs?

513
01:19:23,684 --> 01:19:25,513
Not all of them.

514
01:19:28,219 --> 01:19:30,310
So what will you do now?

515
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:37,695
What I've always done. I'm gonna
punish those who have wronged me.

516
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,961
Keltus?
- No.

517
01:19:42,822 --> 01:19:46,630
He is what he is,
I always understood that.

518
01:19:47,014 --> 01:19:48,947
The Shadow then?

519
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:52,590
They cursed the wrong Elf.

520
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:58,645
And they are gonna regret it.
- You should rest, regain your strength.

521
01:19:59,713 --> 01:20:01,627
I'm strong enough.

522
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:06,266
I work alone.
- Alone you will fail.

523
01:20:06,267 --> 01:20:09,417
Keltus was right.
I was meant to help you.

524
01:20:12,438 --> 01:20:14,586
Thanks for saving me.

525
01:20:33,653 --> 01:20:35,448
We must continue.

526
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,012
Down!

527
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:03,386
This is my domain.

528
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:07,119
What is this magic?

529
01:21:07,225 --> 01:21:11,047
It's not magic.
It's a machine, it's a powder.

530
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:13,447
Dwarven devilry!

531
01:21:19,354 --> 01:21:22,511
I'm gonna break your scrawny neck, coward.

532
01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:31,263
I will collect your heads.

533
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:34,621
Orc and Elf kind!

534
01:21:40,918 --> 01:21:43,388
Come, catch me!

535
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:01,606
Now! He's reloading.

536
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:37,054
She is one of us.

537
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,524
But you are an outsider.

538
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:45,959
All hail the God of Death.

539
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:49,958
I bring the thunder!

540
01:22:50,457 --> 01:22:52,606
And I bring the rain.

541
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:07,219
A little sooner would have been nice.

542
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:10,318
I just saved you from a one-armed Dwarf.

543
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:16,491
I hate to have to kill everything twice.

544
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,374
Keltus?

545
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:49,065
You still resist the curse.
I was wrong about you.

546
01:23:49,092 --> 01:23:53,132
There is so much strength in you
and good left in your heart.

547
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,911
You came back.

548
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:00,802
We have to kill them.
- I know.

549
01:24:01,897 --> 01:24:04,007
I lied to you, Nemyt.

550
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,287
The Prophetess would
never have removed the mark.

551
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:10,370
You did your part and
you nearly died. I'm sorry.

552
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:14,184
I do not know how to save you
or even if you can be saved.

553
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,109
Then I will resist it for as long as I can.

554
01:24:19,486 --> 01:24:21,382
So what now?

555
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:28,392
The Shadow agent has
the ashes of Amun Khan.

556
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:31,220
And the blood of Goth Azul.
He took the canteen

557
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:33,283
I collected at the Bleeding Stone.

558
01:24:33,357 --> 01:24:36,468
When they are mixed together
at the entrance to the underworld

559
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:40,134
they will raise an Avatar of Goth Azul,
Lord of the Dead.

560
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:43,652
With him at their head, their
legions will march across the land,

561
01:24:43,671 --> 01:24:46,870
their ranks swelling with the
corpses they reanimate.

562
01:24:47,726 --> 01:24:50,527
And then they will be unstoppable.

563
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:54,050
That sounds bad.

564
01:24:54,903 --> 01:24:56,910
They wait at the Well of Demons.

565
01:24:57,296 --> 01:25:00,492
Their leader Goth Azul was
imprisoned in the underworld.

566
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:03,420
So where is this Well of Demons?

567
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,480
Nemyt was drawn to them,
she is leading us right to it.

568
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:14,883
If anyone had told me I'd be joined
with an Elf and a Human Cleric

569
01:25:15,662 --> 01:25:18,012
I'd have cut off his manhood
and fed it to him.

570
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:19,645
Yeah.

571
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:22,512
Good thing I like you two.

572
01:25:43,866 --> 01:25:45,715
What's happened to you?

573
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:48,344
You're different.

574
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,434
I've left the Order.

575
01:25:52,955 --> 01:25:56,678
And I follow Tarsa,
an Elder God.

576
01:26:00,538 --> 01:26:05,436
It's okay. I was healed.
There is hope for you yet.

577
01:26:06,115 --> 01:26:08,533
Let's get this done.

578
01:27:10,463 --> 01:27:12,631
What are they waiting for?

579
01:27:14,259 --> 01:27:16,762
Lots of innocent people down there.

580
01:27:16,927 --> 01:27:19,007
And the death offering is
enough to please him.

581
01:27:19,379 --> 01:27:23,380
Goth Azul will speak
and the ritual will begin.

582
01:27:23,647 --> 01:27:29,076
Shadow brothers! Prepare to
witness the rebirth of your god.

583
01:27:31,737 --> 01:27:34,522
Now is the time!

584
01:27:35,427 --> 01:27:38,070
Start the ritual!

585
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,483
Are you alright, Nemyt?

586
01:27:48,632 --> 01:27:50,561
I am drawn to the Well of Demons.

587
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:53,600
But I can resist.

588
01:28:05,746 --> 01:28:08,174
They would sense Kullimon
or me among them.

589
01:28:10,315 --> 01:28:13,378
They will accept you.
You can get close enough.

590
01:28:14,346 --> 01:28:17,362
Close enough for what?
- Disrupt the ceremony.

591
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:19,956
Get the Bone Vessel or the blood.

592
01:28:20,078 --> 01:28:23,875
Kullimon and I will provide distraction
to enable you to approach.

593
01:28:23,895 --> 01:28:25,844
Let's say she gets close enough

594
01:28:25,902 --> 01:28:27,964
and even gets the vessel.
What then?

595
01:28:28,148 --> 01:28:31,119
She wouldn't make it
out of there alive.

596
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:36,808
No, but I can break the Bone Vessel,
throw its ashes to the wind.

597
01:28:37,629 --> 01:28:40,786
But they tear her to pieces.
There must be a better plan.

598
01:28:40,885 --> 01:28:45,496
This was always the plan.
It's why Keltus broke me out of prison.

599
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:55,342
I will do it, but swear to me:

600
01:28:55,424 --> 01:28:58,878
If this curse overtakes me you will hunt
this body down and you will destroy it.

601
01:28:58,945 --> 01:29:02,812
Burn it until there's nothing left.
- I swear.

602
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,823
I believe in you, Nemyt.

603
01:29:10,385 --> 01:29:12,923
To die in battle
is the greatest glory.

604
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:16,299
To chose to do so,
is the greatest honor.

605
01:29:17,617 --> 01:29:22,259
Who knows? Maybe even an Elf
can journey to the Hall Of Warriors.

606
01:29:29,772 --> 01:29:32,701
My vengeance on your kind
is satisfied, Kullimon.

607
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:36,038
You have killed enough Orcs?
- No.

608
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:38,896
There's one I'm glad I didn't kill.

609
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:43,341
Hurry!

610
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,239
Nemyt.

611
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,788
Throw them in.

612
01:30:03,245 --> 01:30:05,636
No, no...

613
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:32,502
I sense something.
She's not gonna make it.

614
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:14,132
She stopped. The curse
was too much for her.

615
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:17,590
We will do our part.
Have faith she'll do hers.

616
01:31:17,877 --> 01:31:20,119
Come on.

617
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,809
Kill the intruders!

618
01:32:07,353 --> 01:32:10,438
They took the bait.
You ready to die?

619
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,810
I tried that once before.
Didn't suit me.

620
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:26,611
Your heart is black,
your soul is dead.

621
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:30,449
Now fall on your sword.

622
01:32:43,773 --> 01:32:46,653
Fall on your sword.

623
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:50,687
You will obey.
- No.

624
01:33:39,594 --> 01:33:45,270
It is time, nothing can stop us now.

625
01:33:48,426 --> 01:33:51,185
Kullimon! Nemyt!

626
01:33:57,816 --> 01:34:01,121
I promised you pain and death.

627
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:04,152
Elf. Witch.

628
01:34:13,975 --> 01:34:19,950
With the ashes of Amun Khan
and the blood of Goth Azul

629
01:34:20,376 --> 01:34:24,955
the God of Death is reborn!

630
01:34:29,595 --> 01:34:34,139
There is no escape
for you this time.

631
01:34:42,629 --> 01:34:46,362
Yes, Kullimon.

632
01:34:48,003 --> 01:34:51,393
So we meet again
for the last time.

633
01:34:53,847 --> 01:34:58,810
Your pet Elf is about to die.

634
01:35:01,267 --> 01:35:05,053
You will die of shame,
Mulgrut the Damned.

635
01:36:26,073 --> 01:36:27,042
I ...

636
01:36:27,105 --> 01:36:28,225
... am ...

637
01:36:28,346 --> 01:36:30,995
... immortal!

638
01:37:12,089 --> 01:37:14,433
I ... I failed.

639
01:37:15,009 --> 01:37:17,371
You did your part.

640
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,855
Now Keltus must do his.

641
01:39:21,931 --> 01:39:23,752
She's dying.

642
01:39:29,988 --> 01:39:33,525
We have overcome the Shadow.
You're free.

643
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:39,209
Help me, Keltus.

644
01:39:55,977 --> 01:39:58,386
Nemyt...

645
01:40:37,687 --> 01:40:39,846
What ... what happened?

646
01:40:41,393 --> 01:40:43,600
You died!
- What?

647
01:40:48,681 --> 01:40:50,811
You brought me back.

648
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,458
As I was brought back.

649
01:40:58,654 --> 01:41:01,413
So, Your Holiness...

650
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:06,562
Any magic left in those puny hands
to heal an old Orc's wounds?

651
01:41:07,415 --> 01:41:11,956
I don't want to waste it.
Anyway, you heal quick, don't you?

652
01:41:19,353 --> 01:41:23,139
75, 150, 600 men.

653
01:41:23,261 --> 01:41:25,520
We need a big bag.

654
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,311
Nemyt!
Better get moving.

655
01:41:29,382 --> 01:41:31,944
The sun's coming up.
This is dragon country.

656
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:34,639
Do you not know the bounty
on all these heads?

657
01:41:34,827 --> 01:41:37,424
Haven't you learned your
lesson about bounties?

658
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:41,181
Fine. I'm coming back later.

659
01:41:50,013 --> 01:41:54,226
We're splitting that money three ways
- How about we all fight for it?

660
01:41:54,387 --> 01:41:58,815
Why not? You'll end up with nothing.
- Fine by me.

661
01:41:58,835 --> 01:42:01,585
You two will kill each other
and I walk away with the gold.
