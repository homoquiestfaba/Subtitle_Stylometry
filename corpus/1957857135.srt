1
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,352
He'll tell him

2
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,824
"Who like God?"

3
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,747
good morning Miss Gutierrez

4
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,875
how are you?

5
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,169
Good morning

6
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,381
I'm great, how are you?

7
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,050
Great

8
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,552
how did you sleep?

9
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,849
What are you making?

10
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,852
Ham and eggs

11
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,729
do you like it?

12
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,233
Of course

13
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,948
did I make it too salty?

14
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,993
It's perfect

15
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,537
don't be silly

16
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,418
well, now you're eating all of it

17
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,296
all of it

18
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,551
hey! no no no!

19
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,427
You can't take this shirt

20
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,471
this is an old shirt

21
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,056
no no this one is new

22
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,516
no let's go

23
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,683
put on an old one for work

24
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,060
you are not going like that

25
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,311
come on

26
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,455
hey man, good morning!

27
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,957
Good morning Leo! what's up!

28
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,060
Why do you get here so late?

29
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,503
Well... I had a huge breakfast

30
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,545
what's going on

31
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,381
breakfast? you're just a lazy ass

32
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,799
let's see when I start working

33
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,093
we'll see who looks lazy!

34
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,218
You said it man

35
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,220
ok then

36
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,430
we'll have some tequila later!

37
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,098
You got it!

38
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,098
I'll see you later!

39
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,936
What's up my Leo

40
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,229
hey

41
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,789
hurry up man

42
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,457
come on

43
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,791
stop busting my balls man

44
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,428
"may God be with you all"

45
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,846
"and with your spirit"

46
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,138
"of the holy gospel"

47
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,391
"according to San Juan"

48
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,476
"glory to you, God"

49
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,231
"among those who had come to Jerusalem"

50
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,482
"to worship god"

51
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,025
"to the easter festivities"

52
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,568
"there were some greeks"

53
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,362
"who came close to Felipe"

54
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,989
"and coming out of Galilia"

55
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,241
"they told him"

56
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,618
"lord, we would like to see Jesus"

57
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,454
"Felipe went to tell Andres"

58
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,416
"Andres and Felipe went to tell Jesus"

59
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,543
"and he responded"

60
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,213
"the time has come for the
song of man to be glorified"

61
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,631
hello!

62
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,298
Whats's up my man

63
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,882
how are you guys?

64
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,924
How is everything going

65
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,801
very good

66
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,884
I'm glad

67
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,781
they tell me you're going to the U.S.

68
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,055
Yes

69
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,639
going north

70
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,348
yes

71
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,141
I'm glad

72
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,392
I finally convinced Emma

73
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,767
and Memo is getting you work

74
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,895
yes he helped me out

75
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,771
I never thought you'd be

76
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,771
a northerner

77
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,231
I didn't either

78
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,924
it's your turn to buy the beers now

79
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,569
I'm expecting it

80
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,080
when?

81
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,793
A week

82
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,135
to where and why so far?

83
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,556
Fresno... with Memo

84
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,142
he has work for me

85
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,685
in the cropfields

86
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,064
ahh... son

87
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,317
things aren't how

88
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,110
how they paint them

89
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,685
money doesn't fall from the sky

90
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,489
and the streets aren't

91
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,741
lined with gold

92
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,620
there is lots of work

93
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,996
you can do well

94
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,166
I won't argue that

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,755
but you'll never see your family

96
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,256
you'll never be with them

97
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,220
the americans will suck you dry

98
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,726
here, you want for nothing

99
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,853
this is your town

100
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,982
humble but happy

101
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,737
Emma is pregnant

102
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,793
now everything makes sense

103
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,673
what can I say

104
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,513
only one piece of advice

105
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,016
when you're over there

106
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,352
don't worry about the Americans

107
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,731
worry about the Mexicans with papers

108
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,775
those

109
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,318
those are bastards!

110
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,820
That forgot what it's like

111
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,322
what it means to cross the border

112
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,953
It's sad but true

113
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,794
I'll go for a few years

114
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,212
and come back

115
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,631
that's what they

116
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,758
all say son

117
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,429
that's what they all say

118
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,076
we're passing here

119
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,286
just beyond that is the U.S.

120
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,582
you're going to ask for Javier

121
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,709
just be careful

122
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:34,842
let's go!

123
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,385
Let's go! run!

124
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,178
Let's go!

125
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,553
The police!

126
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,221
Leo

127
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,265
run!

128
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:41,807
Go!

129
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,308
Hey!

130
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,725
Hey!

131
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,017
Don't move!

132
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,851
Where are you going!

133
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,560
Where are you going!

134
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,685
Hey! hey!

135
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,396
Come here! come here!

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
Come over here!

137
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,025
Don't move!

138
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:51,442
Don't move!

139
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,234
Sir please

140
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,027
shut up!

141
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,446
Shut up!

142
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,529
Where are you going?

143
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,614
Where are you going?

144
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,240
Just here

145
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:58,741
what do you mean here!?

146
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,116
Just here

147
00:10:59,241 --> 00:10:59,533

00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,576
shut up!

150
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,119
I didn't do anything wrong

151
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,330
what the fuck is this!?

152
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:06,749
That's all I have!

153
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,208
Please sir!

154
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:07,583
Nah! nah!

155
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,709
Stop fucking around asshole!

156
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,418
That's all I have left!

157
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,502
Shut the fuck up!

158
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,170

159
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,339

Please leave us alone

165
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,650
we didn't do anything

166
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,609
shut up!

167
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,693
What's up?

182
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,825

you're leaving all of them!

184
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,371
Don't put your hands

in my lane

186
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,834

00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,467

Show Leo how it's done!

195
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,732
Too much talking

196
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,276
not enough work

197
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,970

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,529
To go north?

263
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:23,740
I never thought

264
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,824
I'd leave my Jalos

265
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:25,951

266
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:26,785

00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,869
but we're going

269
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,621
It's good

270
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,705

00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,351
I love how you both

275
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,352

276
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:40,979

277
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,771
thank you!

278
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,482
I loved the picture too

279
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,733
but

280
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:46,776
cousin when do

281
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,819
get your ring?

282
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,237
That's all you

283
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,237
guys think about

284
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,116
I don't know...

285
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,783
hopefully soon

286
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,453
if he gives it to you

287
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,205
he's taking you north

288
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,831
no no

289
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,249
Leo doesn't like the U.S.

290
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,250
he wants to live

291
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,834
In our town

292
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,002
all our lives

293
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,544
we're happy here

294
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,256
that's what they all say

295
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,383
I'm sure of it

296
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,009
no

297
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,009
No!

298
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,299
Careful

299
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,925
look!

300
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,886
Look! look!

301
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,934
Look mom!

302
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,685
What if we take her out?

303
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,105
You know the answer

304
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,190
why ask me

305
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,570
we haven't been out in weeks

306
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,781
Luciana worries me

307
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,786
Emma things are very dangerous

308
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,787
right now

309
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,790
we can't take that risk

310
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,667
please understand

311
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,752
look mom! look!

312
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,391
Good morning Emma

313
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,101
good morning

314
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,187

315
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,171

316
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,958
I'm good and you?

317
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,088
What are you doing?

318
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,633
Ok

319
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,053
Bye

320
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,021
come here my love

321
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,855
I need you to go get a kilo

322
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,856
of tortillas

323
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,025
ok mom

324
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:14,818
I'll be right back

325
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,818

326
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,071

327
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,113
ok

328
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,157
Ok don't take long!

329
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,795
Tired huh

330
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,008
what I most miss is the food

331
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,552
the tortillas taste like paper here

332
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,934
I need some flour tortillas

333
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,263
again!

334
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,643
Luciana was waiting for you

335
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,771
you work all day

336
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,188
we never see you

337
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,774
and now this!

338
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,572
Stop fucking bothering me

339
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,700
I'm getting sick of this

340
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,159
stop!

341
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,556
Should we go far from here?

342
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,434
No

343
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,728
I wouldn't leave Jalos

344
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,564
why do you ask?

345
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,107
Why do I ask

346
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,903
because I want to marry you

347
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,571
I want you to be mine

348
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
hello?

349
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,485
At what time?

350
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,576
How is my mom?

351
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,190
No

352
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:04,816
How?

353
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,816
I can't

354
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,402
what if I get stuck?

355
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,237
If I can't come back soon

356
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:12,948
what will you do?

357
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,370
Don't worry about that Leo

358
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,081
It's your dad

359
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,290
you have to go

360
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,016
Leo is messing up

361
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,476
come on Leo!

362
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,438
Leo isn't doing his job

363
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,588
never be afraid to cry son

364
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,800
real men cry

365
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,209
daddy! daddy!

366
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,628
Look! Ice cream!

367
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,214
You want an ice cream?

368
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,215
Yes!

369
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,475
Good afternoon

370
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,936
hi

371
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,146
Umm... yes

372
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,441
we wanted an ice cream

373
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,429
Leo let's just go

374
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,696
no daddy!

375
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,281
No!

376
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,867
Come on get up!

377
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,951
No!

378
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,419
Why do you drink so much?

379
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,052
If you're so unhappy

380
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,513
let's go back to Mexico

381
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,225
no one is forcing us to be here

382
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,020
go back for what?

383
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,272
To make no money

384
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,858
I don't want that for us

385
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,320
you don't want that for us?

386
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,241
What is this life?

387
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,410
Alone

388
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,410
closed off

389
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,537
no friends

390
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,831
no family

391
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,129
I was happy with what we had

392
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,631
you wanted this!

393
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,301
You think I want this!

394
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,596
You think I want to deal
with racist bitches!

395
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,514
Like yesterday

396
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,514
huh

397
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,599
huh!

398
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,268
I do it for my daughter

399
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,020
I do it for her and for you

400
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,021
understand it!

401
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,322
We are here in the name of our son Leo

402
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,533
he wants to marry your daughter

403
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,912
and you know what your doing?

404
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,208
Do you know where you're going?

405
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,419
Do you know what marriage represents?

406
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,128
Yes

407
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,255
the highs and the lows

408
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,297
the problems

409
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,052
are you willing your husband anywhere?

410
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,512
Yes of course

411
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,323
you have the example from your mother

412
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,349
she's been a great women at home

413
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,061
I wouldn't expect any less from you

414
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,021
you're willing to make this sacrifices

415
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,440
for your Leo?

416
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,816
Of course

417
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,151
I love him

418
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,278
well what else can I say

419
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,280
then it is so

420
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
let's toast

421
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,366
to health

422
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,914
you guys will be fine

423
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,208
you'll see

424
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,626
Leo is a great boy

425
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,460
very responsible

426
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,961
since he was young, hard working

427
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,962
just like his dad

428
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,089
I know

429
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
well

430
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,426
can I go look for Leo?

431
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,761
Yes!

432
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,430
Thank you so much

433
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,265
you are welcome

434
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,224
have a great day

435
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,224
thank you

436
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,726
welcome to the family

437
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,271
we can't wait for the grandkids

438
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,278
thank you dad

439
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,364
what are you doing here?

440
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,907
Don't ask, come with me

441
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,493
where are you taking me?

442
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,077
Where is Leo?

443
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,788
You'll see him soon

444
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,373
I am so sick of this!

445
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,710
I can't take it anymore!

446
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,628
Why Leo?

447
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,255
Why God?

448
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,726
Luciana never sees you

449
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,603
you always come home late

450
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,189
drunk

451
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,901
what's wrong?

452
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,029
You can't hear me?

453
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Leo!

454
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,453
Leo

455
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,043
look at me asshole!

456
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,921
If I had somewhere to go!

457
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,714
I would have left already!

458
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,340
This is not a life!

459
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,926
What did you say!

460
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,636
Why do you say that to me!

461
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,886
Huh!

462
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,139
After all the fucking work I do!

463
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,181
Everyday!

464
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,474
For you!

465
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,102
I left my family for you!

466
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:49,937
I left my town!

467
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,648
For my family, for you!

468
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,315
And you say this to me!

469
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,441
You fucking bitch!

470
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,735
You fucking whore!

471
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,861
Ungrateful!

472
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,614
I followed you

473
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,283
I trusted you

474
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,080
you've become a different person

475
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,125
not a man!

476
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,473
Luciana!

477
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,724
Luciana!

478
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,642
No! no!

479
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,603
No!

480
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:17,982
We have to go inside!

481
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,445
Get up!

482
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,426
Name of the father

483
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,135
of the son

484
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,469
and the holy spirit

485
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,603
God save you Mary

486
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:37,813
full of grace

487
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,856
The Lord is with thee

488
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,817
Blessed art thou among women

489
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,362
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus

490
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,364
Holy Mary, Mother of God

491
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,826
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of death

492
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,351
you have to go

493
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,148
you have to take her

494
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,945
If people find out

495
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,405
we go to jail

496
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,204
It was an accident

497
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,665
they have to understand

498
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,417
we are illegals here

499
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,922
we are nothing

500
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,636
what do you think will happen to us

501
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,640
you think they'll believe us?

502
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,562
Get up

503
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,065
take her

504
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,527
where?

505
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,241
Where we should have gone

506
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,660
a long time ago

507
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,581
to our town

508
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,094
please

509
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,139
get my daughter out of here

510
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,691
Emma called me

511
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,468
any chance?

512
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,090
Good afternoon honey

513
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,175
my love

514
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,598
I haven't heard from your mother yet

515
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,350
when she arrives

516
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,726
I'll bring her

517
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,108
I miss you everyday

518
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,484
too much

519
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,612
way too much

520
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,494
sometimes I feel like

521
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,162
going with you

522
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,456
but I love your mother

523
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,173
like everyday

524
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,718
I ask your forgiveness

525
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,221
please forgive me

526
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,602
forgive me!

527
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,313
Forgive me my child

528
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,696
forgive me!

529
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,158
Please forgive me!

530
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,745
Please!

531
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,622
Forgive me child!

532
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,169
I want to go with you!

533
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,487
She forgives you

534
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,952
she forgives you

535
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,136
daddy! daddy!

536
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,307
Hi my love

537
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,476
how are you?

538
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,647
I want to see the ocean

539
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,402
yes

540
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,861
of course

541
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,614
I'll take you to the ocean

542
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,534
we'll go all day

543
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,118
we'll sit out in the sun

544
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,620
we'll swim

545
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,705
yes

546
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,957
what do you think?

547
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,085
I want to see my grand parents

548
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,920
and I want to play with my cousins

549
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,340
yes

550
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,509
whatever you want

551
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,970
whatever you want

552
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,889
my child

553
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,142
whatever you want

554
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,647
whatever you want

555
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,237
my darling please forgive me

556
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,200
forgive me
