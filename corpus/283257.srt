1
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,514
This is my first mission

2
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,656
I want to shoot the whole process

3
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,353
Human memories are too complicated

4
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,059
As time passes, you may deceive yourself

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,202
What is recorded is reality

6
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,850
Last month
a shootout between police and criminals

7
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,215
left 5 police officers dead

8
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,982
7 police officers
are still in critical condition

9
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,149
In this mission
code named Panther Killer

10
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,783
Panther Duen, the younger of 2 brothers

11
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,487
responsible for many armed robberies

12
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,791
and operating
a drug trafficking syndicate

13
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,161
will go to court

14
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,564
to attend a hearing held 2 hours later

15
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,592
Apart from the HK Police
Interpol agents

16
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,264
sent from HK, China, America and England

17
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,864
who will help to prosecute Panther Duen

18
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,431
have come to give evidence that provides

19
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,842
the key to destroy
Duen's illegal businesses

20
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,688
Police, freeze!

21
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,688
Police!

22
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,579
I'm Pak Yut Suet I'm Wang Sun Ho

23
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,648
Hi, my name is Luo Zai Jun
Hi, I'm James Lam

24
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,716
I'm Pak Yut Suet I'm Hung Kei Lok

25
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,517
Hello Nice to meet you

26
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,755
I'm Luo Zai Jun Hello

27
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,826
Hello Hello

28
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,033
Lady, Gentlemen

29
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,103
Let me introduce to you
the officer in charge of this case

30
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,502
commander Hong Sun

31
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,309
On behalf of the Hong Kong Police
thank you

32
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,483
for bringing this evidence

33
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,653
I assure that both you and the evidence

34
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,088
will be taken to the court under our

35
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,091
strictest protection

36
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,485
Protect us?

37
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,496
I'm in charge of this case

38
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,892
I won't let anything untoward happen

39
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,067
This is your final order

40
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,765
Yes sir!

41
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,935
Let's go

42
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,625
What're you doing?

43
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,564
It's my first mission

44
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,729
I wanna shoot the whole process

45
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,404
Human memories are too complicated

46
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,373
As time passes, you may deceive yourself

47
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,440
What is recorded is reality

48
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,673
Sometimes it's not bad to cheat yourself

49
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,147
At least you can forget the sad stuff

50
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,442
Don't make things so complicated

51
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,419
I've forgotten many things

52
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,483
even my mom's birthday

53
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,659
It's my job to cheat myself

54
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,595
Otherwise how can I cheat other people?

55
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,164
Did you ever regret
being an undercover cop?

56
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,900
2 words: only once

57
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,801
We snipers hope
only a single shot will do

58
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,548
Miss, what's the matter?

59
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,890
Are you OK?

60
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,186
What?

61
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,525
Sit down

62
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,329
Don't worry

63
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,432
lt'll all be over soon

64
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,568
Everybody watch out

65
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,334
Beware of Panther

66
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,357
Ready

67
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,840
What the hell?

68
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,274
Watch Out!

69
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,917
Move!

70
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,823
Move!

71
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,959
Freeze! Hands up!

72
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,698
Freeze! Freeze!

73
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,771
Who's the asshole there?

74
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,730
Madam What?

75
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,238
We've fallen into Han's trap, run

76
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,639
Roger

77
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,442
Nobody's here?

78
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,072
Definitely not

79
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,479
The real prison van's
near the court by now

80
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,710
Why didn't you tell us?

81
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,449
We're not playing games here!

82
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,453
Calm down...

83
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,590
Attention

84
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,286
Patrol car's out of touch
in Central for 15 minutes

85
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,818
All the police officers
and firearms are missing

86
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:57,453
Roger out

87
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,497
Alpha Team

88
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,893
Move
Move out, A Team. Get on the car

89
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,560
Where're they going?

90
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,928
You punks!

91
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,561
What the hell

92
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,620
Calling all cars

93
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,487
The missing patrol car
and those firearms are still missing

94
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,352
B team watch out, ready for action

95
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,430
What's happening out there?

96
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,895
Sir, the police control car

97
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,267
and many dead officers are there

98
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,760
Go and see what's happening

99
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,085
Don't be scared, don't move

100
00:10:54,453 --> 00:11:01,086
Calm down... Don't hurry

101
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,056
Don't hurry!

102
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,724
I've been looking for you

103
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,815
Cover me

104
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,764
You cover me!

105
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,326
Cover me!

106
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,426
Cover me!

107
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,689
Stay calm!

108
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,179
Please don't

109
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,488
No, please don't

110
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,324
Goddamn mother fucker!

111
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,403
Sir, please comment...

112
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,904
Sir, what's police next strategy?

113
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,141
Is there any new move?

114
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,308
Sir, will this case
pass to Interpol agents?

115
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,248
The Panther case is not over yet

116
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,120
I've no right to send you away

117
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,819
But if you do anything wrong

118
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,856
I do have the right to arrest you

119
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,115
Are you OK, Boss?

120
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,719
Isn't that the car provided for
our guests? It's a mess!

121
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,250
Those sons of bitches!

122
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,022
Long Yes

123
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,928
You take care of those goddamn punks

124
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,967
And never, ever let them drive!

125
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,697
Understand? Sure

126
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,512
He's a good dog

127
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,586
He's Friday, retired due to injury
still on salary

128
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,121
I'm gonna join him in retirement

129
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,662
In 5 days time

130
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,924
The head of an international triad group
Panther Duen

131
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,028
was abducted en route
to his court appearance

132
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,061
Listen to the news!

133
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,067
A cop should be more polite

134
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,670
You should at least call me 'uncle'

135
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,042
My name's Kong Long, I'm your senior

136
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,776
but you can just call me 'Long'

137
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,779
Please turn on the radio, Long

138
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,888
The news is over

139
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,516
The HK Police had so many casualties

140
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,788
And you don't care about it?

141
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,519
Colleagues died

142
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,929
others will take their place

143
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,297
Who'd go on patrol
if everyone went for revenge?

144
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,664
Who'd arrange your food
if I went off like that?

145
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,998
Do your part or the world will be a mess

146
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,640
I agree

147
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,984
There's a pub near your place
open 24 hours

148
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,619
Call me, anytime, no problem

149
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,689
Sister Morning

150
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,884
Brother

151
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,410
What are you doing here?

152
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,784
That's a big case, gotta go back

153
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,093
I've brought you something

154
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,892
Have you checked who they are?

155
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,863
I've told you many times

156
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,734
Do your best

157
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,431
Come and eat

158
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,170
Don't worry about me

159
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,446
I'm used to being here all these years

160
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,475
You still have a chance

161
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,010
You gotta do your best

162
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,983
Uphold the family name

163
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,388
Understand, Lok?

164
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,691
Sure. Now eat something

165
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,477
Be accurate...

166
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,706
Hey, what're you up to?

167
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,108
Give me 1 minute and I'll show you

168
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,576
Be accurate...

169
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,749
No money, no play

170
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,888
You're a sharpshooter

171
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,827
Somebody's waiting for you

172
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,893
Let me cover you

173
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,696
Can I try it?

174
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,815
A lefty sharpshooter indeed

175
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,285
I admire you

176
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,212
You're great! Ok

177
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,880
This is marksmanship

178
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,386
I only learned to shoot on the move

179
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,150
I'm not used to standing still

180
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,414
Please give me the chance

181
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,742
Let me borrow the gun

182
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,620
Let me shoot the rest

183
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,799
Thanks

184
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,136
This is what a sniper does

185
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,939
I feel

186
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,071
We make a good team

187
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,852
Team?

188
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,316
Why not?

189
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,026
They're well organized

190
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,088
obviously not just a local triad group

191
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,898
They use military tactics

192
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,168
I'm sure the sniper is a female

193
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,465
I hacked into the HK Police records

194
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,908
Apart from the sniper's weapon

195
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,604
their guns are those
used by the local police

196
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,077
One officer was stabbed to death
with a knife

197
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,940
One slash, straightforward

198
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,680
How would Tiger
get such a powerful group?

199
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,157
Guys, I think

200
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,487
target won't come out
unless we take action

201
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,488
I know what you're thinking

202
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,332
Let's go to Tiger's place to take a look

203
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:17,968
This is it

204
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,511
Do you know how much they earn
from this street?

205
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,210
Drugs, gambling, prostitution
visible and invisible

206
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,806
on the street and underground

207
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,215
$10 million a day

208
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,550
They've changed the working hours

209
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,613
Packing up so early? Then I ask you

210
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,818
Wouldn't they still want to make money?

211
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,960
Unless their boss was in trouble

212
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,061
Which means Panther wasn't rescued

213
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,258
but captured

214
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,033
Long

215
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,565
Who do you think did it?

216
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,306
This is a great location

217
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,337
Somebody wanted to rent it

218
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,905
We'll close the deal in 2 days time

219
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,917
Make your decision

220
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,441
Or I can't help you any more

221
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,169
Yuet, Sarge

222
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,009
Open his eyes

223
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,020
Ko...?

224
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,422
My brother will give your money back!

225
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,427
Let me go...

226
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,733
I never owed anyone

227
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,664
And I don't like...

228
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,599
to be owed

229
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,668
I'll give you everything back

230
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,913
Please let me go...

231
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,973
Let me introduce my new friend

232
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,581
This is Petros

233
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,825
Dominic's older bother

234
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,651
No, it was an accident

235
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,855
I don't mean to, no, I didn't kill him

236
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,886
It's okay

237
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,357
Dominic was a wild one

238
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,804
He spent his whole life
trying to get himself killed

239
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,101
Yeah

240
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,436
All things are negotiable

241
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,008
except the truth

242
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,281
And every lie has a price

243
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,628
Do it

244
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,662
I want to see Tiger Duen

245
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,546
What do you want with the boss?

246
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,434
It's Panther's ear!

247
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,433
Nobody move!

248
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,366
Tell Tiger that his old buddy came by

249
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,410
He knows what I want

250
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,998
Ching Tiger?

251
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,198
Send me some sms, I gotta work

252
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,665
Got it

253
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,607
How're you doing?

254
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,779
I'm fine, don't worry

255
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,608
I've been busy lately

256
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,617
I'll come to see you soon

257
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,110
OK

258
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,380
Be careful

259
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,392
Some colleagues say
Long walks his dog here every day

260
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,930
That Long has such an odd character

261
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,593
I'm afraid he won't help us

262
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,898
Don't worry

263
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,531
Asking for help is easier for women

264
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:22,835
I'll handle it

265
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,310
I want to know something
about you HK cops

266
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,840
About what?

267
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,513
For example

268
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,910
Do you need permission

269
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,853
before you date a colleague?

270
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:45,051
And, have you ever fallen in love

271
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,862
with your partner during a case?

272
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:55,966
I did worse than that

273
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,909
I fell in love with my target
when I was undercover

274
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,278
Believe it or not?

275
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,757
Thank you, come again

276
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,661
Pretty girl?

277
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,528
He's still young at heart

278
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,437
What's the matter, sir?

279
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,976
Where's your boss?

280
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,043
Hasn't come? Don't you know me?

281
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,544
Kong Sir

282
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,515
Need some help?

283
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,323
It's fine, everyone has hard times

284
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,255
I'll help you now, then you help me

285
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,999
What're you doing here?

286
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,596
Village boy!

287
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,598
I'm afraid I can't speak well

288
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,707
You talk with them

289
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,311
Come on

290
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,356
Suet

291
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,363
You wanna kill someone?

292
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,062
Watch out!

293
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,301
Wait

294
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,109
Please

295
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,637
Thank you Thank you...

296
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,544
You're welcome

297
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,107
Honestly, you should thank him

298
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,663
I don't need your help

299
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,737
I don't need your help!

300
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,740
I still care

301
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,243
Care?

302
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,979
Why didn't you care about
mom and me before?

303
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,416
I had so much work to do, I...

304
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,223
You always have so many excuses

305
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,786
Your work's important, isn't it?

306
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,031
You didn't even see mom before she died!

307
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,863
So many lives depended on me

308
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,334
I was the commander

309
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,427
I had to be responsible!

310
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,598
Got it
you only care for your colleagues!

311
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,232
Go to them now

312
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,606
Why come to me?

313
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,592
I know I was wrong

314
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,262
Can't you give me one more chance?

315
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,223
I didn't need your help before

316
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,435
Not now

317
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,705
or in the future!

318
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,307
I don't want a father like you!

319
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,551
I'll do what I promised

320
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,724
Based on the way they acted

321
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,285
I'm sure they're special agents

322
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,966
They break every rule
and it's hard to deal with them

323
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,961
You won't find them using normal methods

324
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,395
They're probably hiding in the city

325
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,564
as normal citizens and

326
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,937
planning their next move

327
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,835
Panther is the deputy, has no real power

328
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,243
I don't think he's their target

329
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,705
It's his brother, Tiger Duen

330
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,180
which means if we get to Tiger Duen

331
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,049
we'll find the agents as well

332
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,550
He has 4 special bodyguards with him

333
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,785
They're known as the Power 4

334
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,453
You gotta put them under surveillance

335
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,107
Look

336
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,647
Kong Long

337
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,457
Ko

338
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,752
You're still fast

339
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,553
Faster every day

340
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,895
I know you'd come to find me

341
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:08,804
Do you know why?

342
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,737
My face's still burns

343
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,698
So, how is your old friend?

344
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,740
Sharp as ever

345
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,506
He's not alone this time

346
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,112
Anything to drink?

347
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,248
No

348
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,927
Sorry

349
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,428
You've never known famine

350
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:16,524
I've seen men kill for less than this

351
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:23,935
They're just kids

352
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,343
Target practice for your team

353
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,505
But Tiger has been playing this game
for a long time

354
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,673
He won't fold his hand
unless we force him to

355
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,947
What's our strategy, Colonel?

356
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,885
There's an old Chinese saying:

357
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,286
You won't cry

358
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,626
until you see the coffin

359
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,998
My team will handle Tiger

360
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,999
And I'll find the girl

361
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,752
Excuse me

362
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,563
Do you speak English? Yes

363
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,191
Good, can you tell me the easiest way
to get to Hollywood road?

364
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,505
No, I'd love to help you
but I'm a tourist here myself

365
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,770
That's why you're taking so many pictures

366
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,209
That's right Right

367
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,716
Ok, alright, well, thanks anyway

368
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,819
Oh, it's you again

369
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,821
Hello

370
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,384
This I know you can help me with

371
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,088
Would you read my fortune for me?

372
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,230
What do you want to know?

373
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,567
I'm looking for a young woman

374
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,863
Do you think I'll find her?

375
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,703
Doesn't look so good. See right here

376
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,246
It says you'll be facing many obstacles

377
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,376
Well, eliminating obstacles
is my specialty

378
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,328
Maybe I can help you

379
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,989
Why don't you give me your number?

380
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,527
No, I think it's better that
we remain strangers

381
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,267
At least give me your name

382
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,467
You already know it!

383
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,271
Shit!

384
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,587
Bye-bye...

385
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,260
Ching

386
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,298
Wah

387
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,702
Going home? Come with me

388
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,707
Yeah, come with Wah I have to go

389
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,602
You bitch, don't get stuck up, get in

390
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,340
You think you're so goddamn special?
No, Wah

391
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,469
Are you OK?

392
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,146
OK

393
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,321
Thank you

394
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,194
Busy body? No, Wah!

395
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,560
Fight back?

396
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,831
No, Wah!

397
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,095
Ching, stay away

398
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,862
It's my fault Stand still

399
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:27,962
No, Wah!

400
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,537
Don't move!

401
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,470
Cops! Run, Wah No, Wah!

402
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,143
Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine

403
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,716
I'm so sorry

404
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,619
It's alright

405
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,726
Thank you

406
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,069
Are you sure you're OK?

407
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,202
Yeah, I'm alright

408
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,805
Besides, it looks like your shoes
get the worst of it

409
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,620
Thanks again

410
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,657
Good night

411
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,310
Why come to see me so late?

412
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:58,592
Tiger Duen

413
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,895
We businessmen
should pay back what we owe

414
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,292
This is for your dead comrades

415
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,768
And this is for you

416
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,704
You owe a lot more than this

417
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,940
Bat

418
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,650
Businessmen should have credit

419
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,824
This is for my brother's ear

420
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,863
Do you think you can get all the money

421
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,363
while you still have my brother?

422
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:41,533
Ko, either take it and let my brother go

423
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:45,266
or I'll kill you

424
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,646
Perhaps you'll decide to pay it

425
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,411
if we make you cry

426
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:57,912
in despair!

427
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:07,429
For you

428
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,096
Grenade! Run!

429
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,562
Soy sauce?

430
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,305
Freeze! Freeze!

431
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,435
Don't go!

432
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,351
Get after him!

433
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,258
Take the gun!

434
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,368
Shoot!

435
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:22,603
Shoot him!

436
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,464
I've no time to play with you

437
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,286
No, Tiger!

438
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,199
Let's move out

439
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,070
It's time for the next show to start

440
00:47:59,176 --> 00:47:59,904
Yes, Colonel

441
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,036
Drop the gun!

442
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,381
Freeze! Shoot me!

443
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:09,283
Drop your guns! Shoot me!

444
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,145
Police! Freeze!

445
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:15,623
And two of you

446
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,554
Drop the gun!

447
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,553
Drop your guns!

448
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,131
Raise your hands!

449
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,348
Can't you give them one more chance?

450
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,524
Remember how your colleagues died?

451
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,925
It's because you didn't follow the orders

452
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:58,197
and wait for backup
That was my fault

453
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,036
These other guys

454
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:06,042
I'm sure they're Ko's agents

455
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,043
I know

456
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,470
I know how to deal with him

457
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,209
Hong, don't fool yourself again

458
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,011
Don't sacrifice your men
for the sake of fame

459
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,915
Work with the other departments

460
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,790
Listen to me

461
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,096
Give yourself a chance, and those kids

462
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,382
Honestly, it's Kong Long who saved you

463
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,425
You must thank him

464
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,361
Let's get some exercise

465
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:11,965
I'm with you

466
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,102
I've jogged on this road over 10 years

467
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,140
But I'll still get lost if I'm careless

468
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,641
It's not easy to follow the right track

469
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,148
You'll find your legs getting heavier

470
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,916
Until one day, you ask yourself

471
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,423
why you go on

472
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,325
In just a few days, I'll be off for good

473
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,797
What happened 3 years ago
wasn't your fault

474
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,924
No-one should blame you
for the deaths of your colleagues

475
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,333
You shouldn't hide away

476
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,268
You shouldn't feel regret

477
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,242
Let me tell you a story

478
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,623
I was only 10 in 1992

479
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:38,488
My dad was a cop

480
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,628
He and his 8 colleagues
had a gun battle with a gang

481
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,192
They took 47 shots in total

482
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,561
What happened?

483
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,704
4 cops died

484
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,204
My dad was one of them

485
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,338
13 years later

486
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,314
Their sons and daughters became friends

487
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,017
3 of them became cops

488
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,985
And I'm one of them

489
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,087
Do you know how we feel

490
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,516
when people talk about our fathers?

491
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,959
We feel so proud

492
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,231
We're proud of them

493
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,508
Kong Sir

494
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,803
We need you to take on the agents

495
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,212
Let me give you some advice

496
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,247
You can't beat them

497
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,613
That's why we need a leader like you

498
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,689
I once was lost

499
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,426
and it was so hard to find myself

500
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,130
I don't want to take the wrong road again

501
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,463
If you insist

502
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,733
do it yourselves

503
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,640
I hope you all make it back safely

504
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:03,670
Kong Long

505
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,306
We can do it without you!

506
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,352
Please

507
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,956
Make yourself at home

508
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,393
Would you like a drink?

509
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,131
Yes, thank you

510
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,161
Tell me, where are you from?

511
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,140
I was born in the States

512
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,933
but I left home when I was 15

513
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,138
Spent some time in Central America
Colombia mostly

514
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,281
then Eastern Europe

515
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,477
now I live in Thailand

516
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,645
Are you here on vacation?

517
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,613
Yeah, I guess you could call it that

518
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,552
I love to watch them fly

519
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,794
they are so free up there

520
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:03,132
Look, this is my younger sister

521
00:54:04,877 --> 00:54:06,003
She's cute

522
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:12,680
This doll was a present from my boyfriend

523
00:54:13,452 --> 00:54:15,283
when he still loved me

524
00:54:16,622 --> 00:54:18,988
He made me promise to keep it

525
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:21,721
I kept my promise

526
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,327
but he did not

527
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:35,533
Here For me?

528
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:39,967
Yes, I wanted to
give you something because

529
00:54:40,012 --> 00:54:42,480
you were so nice to me the other night

530
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,949
Do you like them?

531
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:49,613
They're beautiful

532
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:51,651
Allow me

533
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:01,628
Now, you can go to the ball

534
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:03,666
What?

535
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:06,434
Like Cinderella

536
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:21,181
Are you alright?

537
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,889
Whenever I am happy, I get scared

538
00:55:29,328 --> 00:55:31,694
I know I'll be sad again soon

539
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:43,464
Do you know why the little angel
doesn't have a mouth?

540
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,079
Cos she likes to keep secrets?

541
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:52,706
You will find a smile on her face
when you are happy

542
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:56,149
and a sad face when you're upset

543
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:59,521
She can share all your feelings
