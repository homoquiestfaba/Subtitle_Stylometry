1
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,016
There was a time, long ago,

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,774
when evil men with greed in their hearts

3
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:45,097
would lay siege to the king that possessed
the ancient treasures of the Dark Ages.

4
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:50,734
But the king was in league
with creatures of magic,

5
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,421
forest spirits.

6
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:57,862
Leprechauns,

7
00:00:57,944 --> 00:01:01,653
these guardians summoned from the earth
to protect the gold

8
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:05,299
from falling into the hands of evil men,

9
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:08,383
of wicked men.

10
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:12,452
The legend of their ferocities
spread through the land

11
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:16,253
and all would know not to trifle
with these creatures.

12
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,903
The kings reign would come to an end,

13
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:33,737
and the leprechauns would find their home
again back in Mother Natures embrace.

14
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:37,978
Except for the myth of the one,

15
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,332
the one that did not go back.

16
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,222
No, no!

17
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,263
Jacob!

18
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:16,703
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

19
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:22,980
You can't hide it from me, Jacob.
The rainbow always points to me treasure.

20
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:31,012
Never again, foul creature.
You're going back to hell tonight,

21
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,140
and the Lord will help me send you.

22
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:39,982
Poor misguided Jacob, even if you steal
for God, you still have to pay the Devil.

23
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:46,695
Damn clovers.

24
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,214
The Lord is at my side.

25
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:07,983
In the name of the Father, I condemn thee
to the valley in the shadow of death.

26
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,895
I shall not fear your evil.

27
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,101
Take it all, take it all!
Just don't send me back.

28
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,063
I am sending you back to the earth,
back into the grave whence you came.

29
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:21,780
I banish thee, spawn of Satan!

30
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:29,014
No! Help me! Please!

31
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:32,173
Help, help.

32
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:44,182
I'm sorry. Sorry.

33
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,256
They hiring at the salon?

34
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,017
Fool, it's a women's salon.

35
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,617
What do you think
you're gonna do up in there?

36
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:19,060
I can give massages.
I can help with those bikini waxes.

37
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,180
- Bikini wax?
- Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

38
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,413
A little Mohawk, a little triangle.

39
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:25,223
I'm the fucking bomb
with that shit, for real.

40
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:27,903
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

41
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,572
They got everybody's hopes up
for no reason.

42
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:34,334
Yeah, they broke as a motherfucker now.

43
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,574
Anyone ever figure out
what happened to the money?

44
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:41,658
No. It vanished.
I guess the project died with Father Jacob.

45
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:45,301
Damn! How come every time something
good is about to happen

46
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,773
somebody always gotta go and fuck it up?

47
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,533
She looks fine as hell.

48
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:55,613
- Girl! Hey!
- Girl what?

49
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,299
Come here.

50
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:32,214
Yeah, you, punk.

51
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:38,182
- What's up, Watson?
- Don't Watson me, motherfucker!

52
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:44,296
What the fuck is this shit?
What the fuck is this shit?

53
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,340
Well, that was a Christmas gift
from my mom.

54
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:47,903
Shut up, punk. Turn this fool over.

55
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,383
All right, wait, listen. Hold on.

56
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,262
No. Why do you got to do this, man?

57
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:55,780
Watson! Listen... Come on, man!

58
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:58,102
What the fuck is this?

59
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:02,775
You need something, punk?

60
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,540
I didn't think so, motherfucker.

61
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,581
You better have my shit
by the end of this week.

62
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,063
You understand me, motherfucker?

63
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:13,339
And give me these motherfucking shoes.

64
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:15,901
End of the week, punk.

65
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,897
Hey, girl, what you gonna do
with all that cash?

66
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:44,578
I'm saving up for college.
I want to go to Kansas State.

67
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,132
What you gonna do with
your ashy ass in Kansas?

68
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:49,055
Ain't no black people in that motherfucker.

69
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,704
Girl!
She's going somewhere over the rainbow.

70
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,341
- Excuse you, grandma!
- That child is always tripping.

71
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,255
Can I get some service up in here?

72
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:04,063
Will you be having work done
to your extensions?

73
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:08,459
First of all, this ain't no nappy-ass weave.

74
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:11,294
Go ahead, feel it. Feel it.

75
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:15,863
Right, so like I said,
can I get some service up in here?

76
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,582
Hurry up!

77
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,457
Girl, this ain't what I wanted.
See, I knew I should've had Yolanda cut it.

78
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:27,533
Oh, no. I can just...

79
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:30,138
Let me trim a little off the edges.
I need to layer it in the back anyway.

80
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,340
This don't look like no Julia Roberts.

81
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:36,815
- I look like Raggedy fucking Ann. Yolanda!
- Emily, come here.

82
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:40,214
I'm sorry. She kept changing her mind.
She said she wanted long and curly.

83
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,373
Don't back talk, girl.

84
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:44,058
We got customers waiting,
and if you can't cut heads faster than this,

85
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,658
you gonna get your dumb ass replaced.

86
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:51,858
...good on this motherfucker, man.
- Wallet!

87
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:55,620
All through the 'hood, son.

88
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:01,173
- Where you off to, Jackson?
- Nowhere.

89
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,934
Punk ass nigger, drinking Kool-Aid.

90
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,382
It's Powerade, you illiterate motherfucker.

91
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,978
That's why you don't drop out of school
before you learn how to read.

92
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,453
- Motherfucker, I'll beat your...
- Cedric.

93
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:17,413
Doing good for yourself, little brother.

94
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:21,458
You only on the streets a few months
and already you're a big spender.

95
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,899
- Just making ends meet, man.
- Yeah.

96
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:28,216
Only problem that you're making is
you're not a part of this, motherfucker.

97
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,775
I don't want to fight you, Watson.

98
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:37,095
We understand each other.

99
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,343
My brother.

100
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,698
Punk ass motherfucker. What, nigger?

101
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,740
Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

102
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,017
He shook like a motherfucker.

103
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:10,062
"Watson, I don't wanna fight with you."
Bitch-ass, nigger.

104
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:13,216
Watson, man, you had the nigger's heart
going like this, son.

105
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:16,544
You should have let me pop
that motherfucker.

106
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,617
- Kill that motherfucker!
- Fuck.

107
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:25,693
You all right?

108
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,494
Hey, you want to go out Friday?

109
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,539
No.

110
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,503
What, you got plans?

111
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:42,662
No, I ain't got no plans.

112
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:46,453
- What's up then? When we gonna hang out?
- We ain't gonna hang out.

113
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:49,661
Besides, what will we do, anyway,
if we went on a date?

114
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,017
See, look, first of all,

115
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:54,140
we'd go somewhere real nice.
You know what I'm saying?

116
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:57,614
Then we'd drive to the beach.
You know what I mean? Lay out a blanket.

117
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:59,854
You could have one of them
tight ass bikinis on,

118
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:01,616
then all the dudes'll be staring, like,

119
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:05,697
"Damn, she is fine!" But the thing is,
you with me so they will suffer.

120
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:09,976
That sounds good.

121
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,938
For real?

122
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:14,262
Except for a few things.

123
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:17,501
One, you ain't got no car to drive us in.

124
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:22,141
Two, you ain't got no money,
and three, you ain't got me.

125
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,221
What about Saturday?

126
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:30,942
No? Sunday?

127
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:32,693
Well, how about dentistry?

128
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:37,858
Girl, I do not want to be sticking my hands
down people's nasty ass mouths all day.

129
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:49,983
Oh, my God.

130
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:57,462
Looks like we're gonna be
taking the bus to school.

131
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,014
Come on, it's just a car.

132
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:06,934
When's it gonna get better for us, Em?

133
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:09,899
Why our lives got to be like this?

134
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,413
We just got the bad end of things right now.

135
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:16,135
But it's going to get better.

136
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,134
- Promise?
- Promise.

137
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,700
Besides, you don't want
that old beat-up car.

138
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:27,935
- You're too cute for that car.
- I know, huh?

139
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,743
Come on.

140
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:40,181
- I thought you were saving your money up.
- You coming or what?

141
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:43,222
This building should've fell down yesterday.
I'm not going in there.

142
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,693
Well, if you're scared, okay.

143
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:48,778
I'm not scared.

144
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:56,333
Hi!

145
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,614
Good to see you again, Erica.

146
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:07,655
- It's Emily.
- Close enough.

147
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,974
What are you laughing at, Lisa?

148
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:14,902
How do you know my name?

149
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:20,053
Come, sit. All will be revealed.

150
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,177
I see peril coming.

151
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,377
Danger awaits you.

152
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:35,978
Rory?

153
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:38,141
- Is that why we came here?
- Hush, Linda.

154
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:41,182
- Lisa.
- You suffered a great loss,

155
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:43,813
like so many other times in your life.

156
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:49,255
It began with the loss of your parents,
and it has come to this.

157
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:56,421
The nest egg you have created is gone,
along with the bird that stole it.

158
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,499
I see wealth in your future.

159
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:05,419
You'll come into it very soon.

160
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:07,622
Oh, child!

161
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,662
I speak of riches
beyond your wildest dreams.

162
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:13,103
It sounds good.

163
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:16,654
But it must be denied,
for it will come at a high price.

164
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:20,100
- Wait. Wait. Why it got to be denied?
- At what price?

165
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:25,417
The very fabric of your essence
will be torn apart. It must be denied.

166
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:28,936
Heed my words, Erica and Linda.

167
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,900
An evil so dark will come to reclaim it.

168
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:55,942
Does that always happen?

169
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:05,539
This that good shit, dog.

170
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,095
Rory don't play.

171
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:15,140
Yeah, you know you want some of this, dog.

172
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:19,103
No, no, you can't have none. This is my bud.

173
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:22,136
And if you want your own,
you better go out and get a job.

174
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,943
Get paid and then you get
to buy your own shit.

175
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:34,138
What the fuck is this?

176
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:38,936
Oh, Rory got some fucked up agriculture
going on up in this motherfucker.

177
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:42,182
Boy, you talking to my dog again?

178
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:45,298
Just the man I was looking for.

179
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,221
Man, I'm gonna tell you right now,

180
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:49,943
there ain't no clovers in my bud, all right?
So chill with that shit.

181
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:54,142
Man, it was filled with the motherfuckers.
Satisfaction guaranteed.

182
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:57,261
- And I ain't no satisfied customer, yo.
- Satisfied customer?

183
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:58,618
Do I look like a Kmart?

184
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,616
Man, I know my rights,
and that shit wasn't right.

185
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:03,699
All right. Where are the clovers?

186
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,423
See, I knew you was gonna say that,
and that's why I brought these bitches.

187
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:07,903
You know what I'm saying?
They're right here.

188
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,293
A real bag of motherfucking Lucky Charms.

189
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,094
Man, I must have left
the motherfuckers at the crib.

190
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,173
Left them at the crib?

191
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:19,903
Well, check this out, next time make sure
you bring 'em with your sorry ass,

192
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,782
'cause no proof, no motherfucking refund.
All right?

193
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:24,138
All right, man. Damn.

194
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:27,261
You ain't got to get all over my shit.
I'll bring them. You'll see.

195
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:30,063
- Filled with clovers, ninja.
- Ninja?

196
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:33,693
- Nigger, did you just call me a ninja?
- Hey, man, hey.

197
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,975
You need to get out more, man.
Don't nobody say nigger no more.

198
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,180
Yeah. Like, "What up, ninja?"

199
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,292
"Look at them ninja's over there."

200
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:44,421
You need to stop smoking that shit,
you dumbass nigger.

201
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,698
Ninja, please.

202
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:49,974
- Who's the mafia guy?
- Hey, homie.

203
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:53,420
Shut the fuck up, man, or leave.
This is business. All right?

204
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,502
What's up, Marcos?

205
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:59,895
- Got something for you here.
- Got something for you.

206
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,540
I'm gonna be needing some more
in about a week.

207
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,774
My clients love this shit.

208
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:08,742
I swear I sell more because of this chronic.

209
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:13,574
All right, man, just make sure
you hit me up before you do. All right?

210
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,302
I'm sorry, "hit you up"?

211
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:19,414
- Call me.
- All right. My nigger.

212
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:21,539
What?

213
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,661
Man, who you calling nigger, nigger?

214
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:28,063
- I thought we were cool...
- No one says that any more, all right?

215
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:30,658
- It's ninja. My ninja.
- Yeah.

216
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:31,733
Okay.

217
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:35,253
- My ninja.
- My ninja.

218
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:40,421
My bad, fellows. Play on, players.
You look good. That guy looks good.

219
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:44,292
Baby Jordan over there. Okay.
I'll look for you in the pros.

220
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,812
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

221
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:47,462
Somebody got his ass kicked
coming out here.

222
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,344
No matter, man. It's all green,
you know what I'm saying?

223
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,254
Why we couldn't do this at the park,
like normal people?

224
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,460
What park? You see any parks around here?

225
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:57,023
How about the beach?

226
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,181
Now, why you want to go to the beach
when we got all of this right here?

227
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:02,255
'Cause I need to work on my tan.

228
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:05,179
- Girl, you're a mess.
- Yeah, that's right.

229
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:08,540
All my hoes be cooking.
Where my dinner at?

230
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,743
You are so ghetto.

231
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,299
Hey, daddy's home.

232
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:15,899
Yeah.

233
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:18,698
How could you afford this?

234
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:21,173
Well, I had a little help.

235
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:25,179
Jamie, I'm gonna kill you.

236
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,937
What? I had no money for the food,
and I asked him would he float me.

237
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,059
He said, "No".

238
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:31,533
Then he asked me what for,
and I told him we was having a barbecue

239
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:35,060
and that you was going to be here, and
that's when he bought all this extra shit.

240
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,133
Asshole.

241
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:38,420
Look, he even bought wings
and some hot sauce.

242
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,734
You know how much
I love my hot sauce, girl.

243
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:42,701
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

244
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,979
- What up?
- Not much.

245
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:48,137
What's up, Em?

246
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:55,173
- You told her I was coming, right?
- Hell, yeah, man, she just shy.

247
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,822
Here, have a 40.

248
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,501
It's a shame they never finished this, huh?

249
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,303
We ain't got nothing
to say to each other, Rory.

250
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,854
I didn't choose this life for myself.

251
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,978
Look, don't act all high and mighty.
I never asked you for anything.

252
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,816
No, I was just dumb looking out for you.

253
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:02,862
- I didn't want you to give up shit for me.
- Yeah, but I gave up everything.

254
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:06,334
- And I tried to pay you back, right?
- With drug money.

255
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:10,178
You think I was going to take that, Rory?
Then you really are stupid.

256
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:23,297
Oh, shit. Are you all right?

257
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,813
Yeah, get me out of here.

258
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,578
- Here take this. Okay.
- Okay.

259
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:30,814
I'll be right back with some rope.

260
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:37,814
Emily! Emily!

261
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,501
Emily!

262
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:59,977
- Yo, you scared the piss out of me.
- You don't have to worry about me.

263
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:03,340
- You're welcome. What's that?
- I don't know.

264
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,574
- Let's see what's in it.
- Wait a minute.

265
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,654
Holy shit.

266
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:19,294
- How much do you think they're worth?
- Weigh about eight ounces.

267
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:22,502
I say about four or five K apiece,
maybe more if they're old.

268
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,461
You would know the weight.

269
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:27,743
That's like 200 coins,
that's a million dollars.

270
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:30,179
- That's 50 coins each.
- Nice.

271
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,580
What are you talking about?

272
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:36,294
- Sounds fair to me, baby.
- Of course it does to you. She found it.

273
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:38,534
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

274
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,857
Hey, there's more than enough.
We can all benefit from this.

275
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:48,453
Lisa, I want you to take some of this money
and buy yourself a new car,

276
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:51,342
so you don't have
to take the bus to school. Okay?

277
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:53,859
And...

278
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:55,379
Rory.

279
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,654
I want you to do the right thing.

280
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:05,577
- Jamie.
- Yeah, what's up, baby?

281
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:08,178
You cannot use the gold to buy bud.

282
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:11,014
- What?
- No bud.

283
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,095
- Damn!
- You heard me.

284
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,300
What you laughing at? It ain't funny. Shit.

285
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,340
We're in the money!

286
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:20,812
All right. All right. Yeah, baby.

287
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:46,021
Welcome to my lair!

288
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:50,775
You have it, right here. Your medicine.

289
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:55,100
Hey, look at this, this is my first one.
I got it when I was in the fourth grade.

290
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:58,176
- Damn, fourth grade?
- Fourth grade. Yeah, for real.

291
00:27:58,264 --> 00:27:59,902
- That explains a lot.
- Yeah.

292
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:02,544
- That's bad, though. I'm liking that.
- My motherfucker, right here. Okay.

293
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:05,058
- What about this?
- Man, I can't even touch that.

294
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:06,543
Yeah, you can touch it.
You just gotta stroke it.

295
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:09,934
Stroke it right. She likes to be stroked.
You know what I'm saying?

296
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:11,821
Yes, that will put you on your ass.

297
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,464
- I need to get it out right now.
- Yeah.

298
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:15,943
Oh, man.

299
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:19,053
- Hey, my baby.
- What's up, baby?

300
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:20,338
Y'all fucking?

301
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:22,813
- Hey, you know how we do it, baby.
- Hey, you do your thing, man.

302
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:25,020
You don't mind if I sit back
and run one of these, right?

303
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,982
Oh, no, it's all good, man.
Hey, my shit is your shit, baby.

304
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:32,023
Man, we need more black people
like you, man.

305
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:51,503
What's up, girl?

306
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:56,098
He did not just walk up in here
with that skeeze.

307
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:25,223
Oh, this is some good shit.

308
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,820
Oh, no.

309
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:31,223
What's up, little man?
How you living, dawg?

310
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,976
- You want a hit, man? You want a hit?
- Yeah.

311
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,703
I haven't smoked a good pipe in a long time.

312
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:44,339
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
Now let go. Let go. Yeah.

313
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:47,222
- Yeah. You like that, huh?
- That's good shit.

314
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:49,772
Good shit, nigger.
It comes straight from Korea.

315
00:29:49,864 --> 00:29:53,220
I mean, this ain't gonna stunt
your growth or anything, is it?

316
00:30:03,224 --> 00:30:05,021
Yeah, you my nigger, man.

317
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:07,379
I like you, dude. I like you a lot, man.

318
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,375
You know what I'm saying?
I'm gonna get you smoking up.

319
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:11,773
I'll get you some more, dude. I can manage.

320
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:13,775
Don't be stingy with my shit, though.

321
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:22,053
I swear, man, you cool.

322
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:23,782
Oh, man.

323
00:30:27,504 --> 00:30:28,778
Where did you get that?

324
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Hey, man, you don't need
to worry about that, little man.

325
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:34,018
We just here to smoke, all right? You know.

326
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,697
That's me gold. Now give it back.
There's a good boy.

327
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:42,936
What? I'm gonna get you high and you have
the nerve to ask me for my money, man.

328
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:46,699
Man, fuck you. You don't get it, man.
Fuck you. All right? I'll hit a midget, man.

329
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,457
I mean, get the fuck out of here,
you hallucinating motherfucker.

330
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:51,899
What? What, you gonna get in my face?

331
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,940
Man, give me my bong back, bitch.

332
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,413
Damn.

333
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:01,698
Oh, man.

334
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,737
Thanks for the smoke.

335
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:55,777
Yeah.

336
00:31:57,824 --> 00:32:00,019
Man, who the fuck just took my shit?

337
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:01,378
Man, you niggers is crazy.

338
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:04,058
Can't a motherfucker enjoy
a smoke in his own goddamn house

339
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:07,056
without somebody stealing shit? Fuckers!

340
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:05,501
You put that girl to shame.

341
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,223
So you ain't got no beef
with nobody on the street, huh?

342
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:14,420
You think this might have been
Watson's gang?

343
00:33:14,504 --> 00:33:17,098
No, man, I told you I squared everything.

344
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:19,778
What about all that ganja
you guys been smoking?

345
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,253
Ganja? What ganja?

346
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:31,741
Oh, man. My mom's Italian.
She likes a lot of oregano with her lasagne.

347
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:37,292
If you know anything,
now is the time to speak up.

348
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:39,659
- Told you everything, man.
- We don't know anything else.

349
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:41,735
- Don't bullshit me!
- Hold up, man.

350
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:46,102
You've been making a lot of moves on
the street in the past couple of days, Rory.

351
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:49,494
Something tells me you know
exactly what's going on.

352
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:51,974
Hey, look, don't trip. We gonna get you out.

353
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,532
Man, I can't be nobody's prison bitch.
Don't leave me in there.

354
00:33:54,624 --> 00:33:57,980
I know what they do.
I can't be tossing nobody's salad.

355
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,939
Knock it off. Knock it off.

356
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,183
Yo, don't worry, man.
We're coming to get you.

357
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:11,660
It's gonna be okay, Jamie.

358
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:20,182
It's real.

359
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:24,857
Can we speed this up, please? Thank you.

360
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:32,734
How long this gonna take?

361
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:00,578
So fly!

362
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:08,455
Yeah, I'm gonna look good.

363
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,901
You see that shit, man?

364
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:22,858
Man, that's a big fucking account
he just took from us, man.

365
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,059
I mean, fuck this shit.

366
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:26,021
I say we go ice this motherfucker
right fucking now.

367
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:27,093
No, no, no.

368
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:29,493
- Why not?
- He deserves better than that.

369
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,422
What the fuck you talking about?

370
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,301
We're gonna do this right.

371
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:36,059
It's gonna be loud and messy.

372
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:40,093
I'm gonna make his ass a cautionary tale
for the rest of the fucking hood.

373
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:41,458
Hell, yeah.

374
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:45,734
It don't pay to be a nice guy.

375
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:51,613
Hurry up.

376
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:54,298
This is my last day.
You can't do me like this.

377
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,453
What?

378
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,102
You are still on my clock. Got it?

379
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:59,493
It's gonna take me three hours
to rub her down.

380
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,256
- I'm out of here.
- What?

381
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,701
Girl, you better get in there
and rub her down and leave her satisfied.

382
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:06,536
Now I want you to remember
I kept your ass employed

383
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,296
through all your bullshit with Rory,

384
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:12,297
when you would float your ass in here
and do nothing for an entire month.

385
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,617
Now I have no idea what kind
of crazy bullshit that you're mixed up in,

386
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:18,183
but I don't like it.

387
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:21,337
The Emily I remember always kept her word.

388
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,935
That is the shit.

389
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,459
Don't I need some more of that, honey.

390
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,103
I need more oil.

391
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:33,893
How much they put in them small bottles?

392
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,783
- They don't come in beached-whale size.
- What?

393
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:39,333
Nothing. I need some more oil.

394
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,695
Get that Caribbean coconut.

395
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,456
That shit is the bomb.

396
00:36:56,224 --> 00:37:00,217
Hurry up!
Come start rubbing me before I cool down!

397
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:22,136
Oh, God.

398
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:27,813
This is wonderful. Work it, baby. Work it!

399
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:46,381
Oh, you got magic in those little hands.

400
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,736
Yeah, I've always had a way with the ladies.

401
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:09,253
Where's me gold?

402
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,052
Me eye.

403
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:52,982
Irish eyes will soon be smilin' again.

404
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:58,413
Rory! We can't spend any more money.

405
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,779
It's a leprechaun and he's after us.
He wants his gold back.

406
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,139
He's the one who killed that guy,
that guy at the party.

407
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:04,452
What the hell are you talking about?

408
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:05,977
Are you smoking Jamie's stash
or some shit?

409
00:39:06,064 --> 00:39:10,535
Girl, you need to calm down, acting all crazy
talking about leprechauns and shit.

410
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:14,815
What's up, y'all?

411
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,783
We have to get Lisa. Come on.
Come on, we have to go.

412
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:20,456
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Come on, we have to go.

413
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:21,579
I just got here.

414
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:23,734
Just head home and I'll call you
when it's over with. All right?

415
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,257
This doesn't concern you, all right?

416
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:28,256
Here, take this. Okay?

417
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,773
What...

418
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,653
What...

419
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,262
Come on, Em.

420
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:25,143
Into the bath, my pretty.
I like my girls nice and clean.

421
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:27,779
Die, you little motherfucker!

422
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:56,336
Come on. Come on.

423
00:42:59,504 --> 00:43:00,493
9-1-1...

424
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:53,894
I can't believe she's gone.

425
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:02,737
I'm sorry, Em.
I know how much she meant to you.

426
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:06,858
Did you?

427
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:14,256
- All right, so what's next, y'all?
- We return the gold.

428
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:17,381
No. Hell, no. There's gotta be another way.
Fuck that.

429
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:21,776
We return the gold and everything that's left
and maybe all this stuff will stop.

430
00:44:24,304 --> 00:44:25,817
Everybody ante up.

431
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:39,453
- Hey, easy come, easy go.
- We're fucked.

432
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:43,260
You done it again.
How could you spend all of it?

433
00:44:44,824 --> 00:44:47,384
What the fuck is wrong with you, woman?

434
00:44:49,784 --> 00:44:51,536
Oh, shit.

435
00:44:55,704 --> 00:44:57,535
This shit is heavy as hell.

436
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:10,423
Impossible.

437
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:28,223
Shit.

438
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,222
What you waiting for?

439
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,299
Yo, why you bullshitting?

440
00:45:42,384 --> 00:45:44,659
I say we jump in
the motherfucking '64 outside,

441
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:46,860
and haul ass
and don't stop till we get to Mexico.

442
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,423
You in it, partner?

443
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:56,901
We are not spending any more gold.
We're giving it up.

444
00:45:58,104 --> 00:46:00,060
That's a fucking shame.

445
00:46:11,784 --> 00:46:16,016
- I can't believe you left this up.
- It was only four months ago.

446
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:21,734
It was a lifetime ago. You're right, Em.

447
00:46:22,064 --> 00:46:27,138
We gotta give back that gold.
It's your only play.

448
00:46:42,624 --> 00:46:47,095
- You found it. I knew you would.
- What is it?

449
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:48,697
None of you are safe.

450
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:52,254
The accursed one
will not stop until he gets it back.

451
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:54,221
What are you talking about?

452
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:05,463
Where's Rory?

453
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:07,735
He said he had to get something
from his bike.

454
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,860
Where's the gold?

455
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:12,063
Oh, shit!

456
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:23,413
Shit.

457
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:59,099
- Come to bed, my sweet.
- I don't have your gold.

458
00:47:59,184 --> 00:48:02,142
I know that. I'm not here for me gold.

459
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:06,058
- I'll catch that thief soon enough.
- What do you want?

460
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:11,781
Revenge. An eye for an eye.

461
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:07,536
Come on, baby. Come on.

462
00:49:39,624 --> 00:49:43,060
Rory, where the hell you run off to?
You better call me back.

463
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:45,863
I'm not playing with you. Call me back.

464
00:49:47,224 --> 00:49:48,418
Fuck.

465
00:49:52,264 --> 00:49:53,822
Hello, there.

466
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:56,498
How the fuck you get in here,
you crazy-looking motherfucker?

467
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:59,735
That gold didn't even belong
to the one you stole it from.

468
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:03,134
Listen, don't hurt me.
I ain't have nothing to do with this.

469
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:15,542
Leprechaun.

470
00:50:16,824 --> 00:50:20,294
Goddamn crackers,
always breaking into niggers' houses.

471
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:37,094
You have such a nice smile. Say, "Ah."

472
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:57,734
Pull over right now.
Rory, come on, pull over.

473
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,377
What?

474
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:07,138
Yo, Emily, we don't have time for this shit.

475
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,097
Why should I trust you?

476
00:51:13,184 --> 00:51:16,256
Everybody was right about you.
You are no good.

477
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:20,493
You're right. I ain't no good.

478
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:26,133
But I'm trying, Em.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

479
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:42,457
Hit it. Take the alley and cut him off.

480
00:52:01,024 --> 00:52:03,299
- Where you going in such a hurry, boy?
- We're being followed.

481
00:52:03,384 --> 00:52:05,261
- You shut your trap.
- What you got in that box?

482
00:52:05,344 --> 00:52:06,379
Nothing.

483
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:09,376
It's my dirty laundry.
Just give us a ticket and let us go.

484
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:10,943
Hey, hey!

485
00:52:12,024 --> 00:52:13,616
- Here.
- Let her go!

486
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:48,295
What the fuck are you?
A little early for Halloween, ain't we?

487
00:52:48,384 --> 00:52:51,182
- They have me gold.
- Oh, it's your gold.

488
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:54,461
Of course, you're a leprechaun.
So we'll just hand it over to you.

489
00:52:54,544 --> 00:52:57,695
- I'd appreciate it.
- Why don't you go home to your mama?

490
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:01,459
What did you say about me mother?

491
00:53:10,264 --> 00:53:12,095
You want some more?

492
00:53:33,104 --> 00:53:34,139
Come on!

493
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:02,296
Give that back.

494
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:10,339
Shit.

495
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:44,053
Come on.

496
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:05,660
Watch out, kiddies.
Revenge will be mine tonight.

497
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:13,341
Oh, bloody hell.

498
00:55:17,264 --> 00:55:18,697
Jamie.

499
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:24,976
We don't want none. Man, damn.

500
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:26,942
Hold on.

501
00:55:32,064 --> 00:55:34,020
What's up, y'all?
Y'all want some smoke smoke?

502
00:55:34,104 --> 00:55:36,254
- We got to get rid of this gold, right now.
- We have to go.

503
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:38,300
- Why?
- We are being chased by a leprechaun.

504
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:41,103
- Yo, come on.
- Man, you can't be smoking your own shit.

505
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:43,015
That's the first thing they teach you, ninja.

506
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:45,777
- Ninja?
- Don't ask. Come on, man, let's go.

507
00:55:56,384 --> 00:55:57,703
Hey, big spender.

508
00:55:57,904 --> 00:56:01,180
How's the business treating you?
What the fuck you got here?

509
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:03,542
Oh, shit.

510
00:56:05,504 --> 00:56:08,655
Oh, fuck. You slick motherfucker.

511
00:56:09,424 --> 00:56:11,938
No wonder you be acting
like a fucking pimp.

512
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:17,421
Yo, we cool, right? You got the gold.

513
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:20,302
- No, motherfucker. We ain't cool.
- Shit.

514
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:24,333
Police, nigger.

515
00:56:38,424 --> 00:56:40,813
Hell, man, that's nasty.

516
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:48,697
What the fuck is that?

517
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:57,702
- Yo, Watson, shoot that little freak
for real. - Shut the fuck up.

518
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,855
Hello, lads,
I think you got something of mine.

519
00:57:03,344 --> 00:57:06,700
What the fuck you want?
You Lucky-Charm-looking motherfucker.

520
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:10,023
You have stolen
what's been stolen from me.

521
00:57:10,104 --> 00:57:11,822
Hold on, hold on.

522
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:15,783
- Yeah?
- Where the fuck are you?

523
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:17,263
Hey, hey, baby, how you doing?

524
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:20,859
- You think youre really slick...
- No, baby, I can't get into that right now.

525
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:22,138
You with some skanky ho, aint you?

526
00:57:22,224 --> 00:57:25,899
No, baby, I ain't with nobody. Look,
I'm with you and only you, baby. Come on.

527
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:32,139
I know, look, look, I can't. I got a problem,
a small motherfucking problem.

528
00:57:32,424 --> 00:57:36,258
- Look, why don't you call a brother back?
- Okay, love you.

529
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,217
Me too, baby.

530
00:57:42,264 --> 00:57:44,698
Now, you were saying, little motherfucker?

531
00:57:45,984 --> 00:57:48,498
You have stolen
what's been stolen from me.

532
00:57:48,784 --> 00:57:52,982
Now, be a good lad. Give it back.

533
00:57:53,864 --> 00:57:58,699
Oh, the gold is yours?
Of course, a fucking leprechaun.

534
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:03,257
- And you want the gold back?
- Aye.

535
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:06,894
- Well, hold on. Let me get that for you.
- Yeah.

536
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:16,617
Come on, motherfucker, get up. Come on.

537
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:29,382
- You hit like a wee lass.
- Yeah? Okay, motherfucker.

538
00:58:29,624 --> 00:58:31,421
- Come on.
- Yeah.

539
00:58:33,984 --> 00:58:36,134
Who's the wee lass?
The weak lass, the motherfucker.

540
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:39,660
We start this class, bitch.
Welcome to the hood, baby.

541
00:58:47,904 --> 00:58:50,054
Come on, man.
What's the fucking big deal, man?

542
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,342
Getting tired, are we?

543
00:59:11,864 --> 00:59:13,092
Watson!

544
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:15,857
Fuck you!

545
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:42,661
Damn, Watson.

546
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,542
Fuck, man!

547
00:59:49,344 --> 00:59:50,333
What the fuck?

548
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:52,699
Who the fuck...

549
00:59:52,784 --> 00:59:55,582
- What's up, ninjas?
- What the fuck?

550
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:57,942
Kill this motherfucker.

551
01:00:37,144 --> 01:00:38,543
Rory, jump in.

552
01:00:47,464 --> 01:00:49,614
- Let's get out of here.
- You said it.

553
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:52,579
Yeah.

554
01:02:14,784 --> 01:02:16,934
- Hello?
- Who the fuck are you? Wheres Watson?

555
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,503
Watson?

556
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:21,458
- No. He's unavailable. Sorry.
- Are you one of his boys?

557
01:02:21,544 --> 01:02:23,899
You better not run with no skank.
What you look like?

558
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:25,463
What do I look like?

559
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:29,896
Well, I got red hair and a nice smile.

560
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:32,259
- That sounds good.
- Yeah, and I'm a pretty sharp dresser.

561
01:02:32,344 --> 01:02:33,777
- Okay.
- Yeah.

562
01:02:34,144 --> 01:02:38,899
- You work out? You got a good body?
- Yeah, I think I got a good body.

563
01:02:39,984 --> 01:02:42,578
- How tall are you, sweetie?
- How tall am I?

564
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:47,256
- Well, about 3'6".
- 36!

565
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:52,372
Yeah. But I make up for it in other areas,
if you know what I mean.

566
01:02:55,184 --> 01:02:58,256
Hello? Hello?

567
01:03:09,264 --> 01:03:10,697
Why we stopping?

568
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:15,576
Man, it's all done. Oh, man.
There ain't nothing we can do, man.

569
01:03:15,664 --> 01:03:17,575
He's gonna fucking kill us all, man.

570
01:03:17,664 --> 01:03:19,222
Just like he tore apart Lisa.

571
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:20,498
Just chill out, all right?

572
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:23,018
This is your fault, man.
I ain't keeping quiet no more.

573
01:03:23,104 --> 01:03:25,413
- You better slow your fucking roll, you...
- Bitch, out of my face.

574
01:03:25,504 --> 01:03:28,064
Get out of your face? Nigger...

575
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:29,179
You fucking crazy?

576
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:33,416
- Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
- Man, you said you weren't going hurt me!

577
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:36,581
You said you were my friend, man.
You supposed to look out for me.

578
01:03:36,664 --> 01:03:39,815
It ain't my fault I'm scared, man.
Just don't hit me no more.

579
01:03:41,344 --> 01:03:43,175
- He started this shit!
- You started it!

580
01:03:43,264 --> 01:03:45,141
Both of you, shut the fuck up!

581
01:03:45,224 --> 01:03:47,897
That thing is gonna kill all of us
if we don't get our shit together.

582
01:03:47,984 --> 01:03:49,702
The only way
we can survive this is together.

583
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,298
So stop acting like a bunch of mama's boys!

584
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:02,423
My bad, man.

585
01:04:04,664 --> 01:04:06,222
Are we cool?

586
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,976
Yeah, we cool, man.

587
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:24,216
- So, what are we supposed to do now?
- No more running.

588
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:26,814
So, we just sit here
and just wait for him to kill us?

589
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:30,135
No. We gotta kill him first.

590
01:04:30,224 --> 01:04:32,692
How? Bullets don't do shit.

591
01:04:33,024 --> 01:04:35,379
Neither does getting squashed
by a two-ton car.

592
01:04:35,464 --> 01:04:37,898
- How do we kill it?
- I don't know.

593
01:04:38,704 --> 01:04:41,172
But I know just the person to ask.

594
01:04:50,144 --> 01:04:53,932
- We need to talk.
- What about my dead wife?

595
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:55,736
She'll still be dead tomorrow, man.
Come on, let's go.

596
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:57,974
- Get off me.
- Come on, man. Let's go.

597
01:04:58,264 --> 01:05:02,462
Did you heed my warning? Of course not.

598
01:05:02,544 --> 01:05:05,422
No one ever does once they have the gold.

599
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:08,741
And now you have his wrath upon you.

600
01:05:08,824 --> 01:05:11,782
- How do we stop him?
- Why should I help you?

601
01:05:13,464 --> 01:05:15,534
How about that?

602
01:05:23,744 --> 01:05:30,297
These creatures, the Leg're Ghaun.
They are guardians from the Dark Ages.

603
01:05:31,184 --> 01:05:33,379
They were protectors of the king's fortune,

604
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:37,252
born of earth magic,
and retrieve the king's gold

605
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:40,214
and punish anyone who would steal it.

606
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,779
But after the king died,

607
01:05:43,864 --> 01:05:47,937
they were all whisked away,
back into the earth. Except for one.

608
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:54,499
He stayed in this mortal world
and became twisted and evil.

609
01:05:55,104 --> 01:05:57,493
How do we kill this little motherfucker?

610
01:05:57,944 --> 01:06:01,823
This creature's only weakness
are two things.

611
01:06:03,144 --> 01:06:06,500
His gold and the four-leaf clover.

612
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:09,659
Four-leaf clover?

613
01:06:09,744 --> 01:06:13,339
Where the hell are we gonna get
a four-leaf clover in the hood?

614
01:06:16,424 --> 01:06:19,655
Yo, come on, man.
This ain't no time to be lighting up.

615
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:22,854
Told you. Clovers.

616
01:06:25,624 --> 01:06:26,852
My ninja.

617
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:30,332
How do we use this to kill the Leprechaun?

618
01:06:31,064 --> 01:06:35,023
- What about a crucifix?
- This creature predates Christianity.

619
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:38,813
- What about garlic? Will that work?
- Lf he is hungry.

620
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:45,052
That's it. A silver bullet.

621
01:06:45,144 --> 01:06:48,739
Man, why you even buy a Glock, man?
Those bitches always jam.

622
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:55,222
Hollow tips.

623
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,737
What you doing?

624
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,899
Time to go fuck up some little people.

625
01:07:31,064 --> 01:07:32,736
Here you go.

626
01:07:33,824 --> 01:07:36,861
Man, how the fuck you get a gun
and all I get is a goddamn bat?

627
01:07:36,944 --> 01:07:38,093
What am I gonna do? Hit a homerun?

628
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:40,823
Jamie, I just need you
to watch my back, man.

629
01:07:40,904 --> 01:07:43,259
Man, look,
all we gotta do is wait until the morning

630
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:45,096
and the little fucker's toast.

631
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:47,175
- Morning?
- Yeah. Sunlight and shit.

632
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:49,016
He's not a vampire, you dumbass.

633
01:07:49,104 --> 01:07:52,176
Oh, look at you.
Look who's the expert on leprechauns now.

634
01:07:52,264 --> 01:07:54,255
How you know sunlight ain't gonna work?
You don't know.

635
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:56,141
How come you think
you know everything all the time?

636
01:07:56,224 --> 01:07:59,739
All right, you hold right here.
I'm gonna go check on Em, all right?

637
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:03,693
You better come back, too.
Leave me and this motherfucker by myself

638
01:08:04,144 --> 01:08:05,941
with a goddamn bat!

639
01:08:10,384 --> 01:08:11,863
Good luck, my child.

640
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:24,815
I thought I had problems before.

641
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:26,583
Baby, I'm...

642
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:31,497
- I was just, you know...
- Yeah.

643
01:08:45,944 --> 01:08:47,662
Setting up a trap for me, boyo?

644
01:08:47,744 --> 01:08:50,053
Fuck you, you little mick motherfucker.

645
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:55,375
Damned clover!

646
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:03,737
Don't kill me.

647
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:06,015
Take your gold. Take it all.

648
01:09:06,624 --> 01:09:08,103
Just spare me life.

649
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:13,172
I'll never harm you again. I swear.

650
01:09:13,624 --> 01:09:17,697
You swear?
Say hello to Saint Patrick for me, bitch.

651
01:09:22,504 --> 01:09:23,857
It's jammed!

652
01:09:33,864 --> 01:09:35,661
Stay away from my friend!

653
01:09:37,104 --> 01:09:40,983
- You used me gold.
- That's right, bitch. I bought me a new car.

654
01:09:41,064 --> 01:09:45,501
I bought some ice, bought some new kicks
and an assload of bud, too.

655
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:49,463
And I smoked that shit and it was good,
you motherfucker.

656
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:02,133
I have no quarrel with you, witch.

657
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:03,896
Well, that will have to change.

658
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:07,613
Run, Emily.
I have an unwanted guest to deal with.

659
01:11:00,184 --> 01:11:02,618
You can't take the gold. You can't take it.

660
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:04,820
It's mine. I want it back.

661
01:12:03,744 --> 01:12:04,859
No!

662
01:12:37,424 --> 01:12:40,063
You son of a bitch!

663
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:51,418
Rory!

664
01:12:52,944 --> 01:12:55,139
Sorry, that hurt the old knee, did it?

665
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:56,737
Fuck you up!

666
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:14,575
This is what you want, isn't it?

667
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,497
No!

668
01:13:24,504 --> 01:13:25,983
My babies!

669
01:13:27,664 --> 01:13:29,063
Come and get them.

670
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:45,457
No escaping from you this time, darling.

671
01:13:45,544 --> 01:13:48,775
You're going to hell
with all the others who stole from me.

672
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,015
No!

673
01:14:24,904 --> 01:14:26,895
I'll kill you!

674
01:14:41,024 --> 01:14:42,582
I like her.

675
01:15:08,184 --> 01:15:09,697
We've had our fun.

676
01:15:09,784 --> 01:15:13,777
Now give me what's mine,
and I might spare your miserable life.

677
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:17,222
Why did you kill them? For this?

678
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:21,582
- You evil fuck.
- Don't presume to tell me right from wrong.

679
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:24,582
You compromised all you believed in
once you got the gold.

680
01:15:24,664 --> 01:15:28,543
Just like all those before you.
Your kind is weak

681
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,821
and will always give in
to your selfish yearnings.

682
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:36,413
Brings out the worst in us, doesn't it?

683
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:41,142
You really want to die so badly?

684
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,820
You can't live forever.

685
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:46,498
No!

686
01:16:22,944 --> 01:16:25,139
I'm melting!

687
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:55,743
Come on, Rory.

688
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:58,457
Wake up.

689
01:17:00,064 --> 01:17:01,736
Wake up.

690
01:17:06,944 --> 01:17:11,176
- Where is he?
- He's dead.

691
01:17:13,824 --> 01:17:17,658
- It's all over.
- How did you get the gun to work?

692
01:17:18,104 --> 01:17:20,982
- Gun?
- The clovers.

693
01:17:26,384 --> 01:17:29,421
Nothing like a nice fire to warm the soul.

694
01:17:30,584 --> 01:17:32,017
Come on!

695
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:04,021
For 2,000 years, you filthy mortals
have tried to steal my riches

696
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:06,698
to satisfy your greedy urges.

697
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:13,541
And it always ends the same,
with you begging for your miserable lives.

698
01:18:13,624 --> 01:18:16,422
- Rory!
- Fucking...

699
01:18:17,504 --> 01:18:18,857
I'm slipping!

700
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,378
Was it all worth it in the end?

701
01:18:26,224 --> 01:18:31,378
One day your kind will learn
that the treasures of the Leprechaun...

702
01:18:31,464 --> 01:18:32,453
Hey!

703
01:19:25,264 --> 01:19:30,054
All out of clovers, lad? That's too bad.

704
01:21:06,824 --> 01:21:08,974
Check out my ninja.
