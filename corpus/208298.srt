1
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:11,944
Trixie.

2
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:27,693
Gabe, could she use
the bathroom first?

3
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,167
l really gotta pee.

4
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:32,435
Yeah, sure.

5
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:33,962
She's company, Gabe.

6
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,905
l'll be fast.

7
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:42,947
You didn't have to stay out
all night.

8
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:45,281
l fell asleep in the hall.

9
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:48,310
l thought Judy was coming back
from Paris tonight.

10
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,119
That's right.
l need the apartment tonight.

11
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,326
No problem.

12
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,228
Penny, Penny, Twitty,
and Faffenburger.

13
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,995
Vivian Faffenburger's office,
Gabriel speaking.

14
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,195
-Hey, babe.
-Katherine.

15
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,704
-Are you busy?
-l'm so busy.

16
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,105
-Good, can you talk?
-Sure.

17
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:11,838
So, that cute guy
we met at Footlight Records...

18
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,209
took me to dinner.

19
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,111
Oh, that's great.
Oh, my God, babe.

20
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:17,981
Dress rehearsal totally sucked,
but that's good luck, right?

21
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:21,146
No. He took me to dinner because
he wanted me to play piano...

22
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:24,123
for one of his auditions for
the national tour of ''Titanic.''

23
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,351
lt wasn't a date.

24
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,656
Men are such scum.
Can you run lines with me?

25
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,161
Sure, just a sec.

26
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:30,629
Oh, great.

27
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:33,189
Chapter fourteen, right?

28
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:36,862
OK. Who is he, the Son of man?

29
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,098
ls he as beautiful as you are?

30
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,198
Get thee behind me.

31
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,471
l hear in the palace
the beating of the wings...

32
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,909
of the angel of death.

33
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:47,175
-Jokanen.
-Who speaketh?

34
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,409
l am amorous
of your mouth, Jokanen.

35
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,111
lt is like a pomegranate cut
in twain with a knife of ivory.

36
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:54,950
There is nothing in the world
so red as your mouth.

37
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:58,788
Suffer me to kiss your mouth.

38
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:01,521
Don't tell me.

39
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,153
You better tell me.

40
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,595
Never, daughter of Babylon...

41
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,691
daughter of Sodom, never!

42
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,463
This needs to go out
this afternoon.

43
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:10,868
-Never!
-Gotta go.

44
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,394
Call me later.

45
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:15,664
Can you sign my timecard?

46
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,392
Hard day at the office?

47
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,292
Did you find a rhyme
for the lyric in the second ''A''?

48
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,796
l'm working on it.

49
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,389
Uh, what's with the umbrella?

50
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,026
What am l supposed to sing?

51
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:43,865
Should l hum or what?

52
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,030
Yeah, yeah, hum.

53
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,936
Or maybe la la la.

54
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,463
-Fine.
-l'll wing it.

55
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,442
Are we in studio ''D,''
because l hate...

56
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,104
what the acoustics
in that room do to my voice.

57
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:05,054
OK, this is the song for
the second act of my musical.

58
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,583
Uh, it will be sung
by the character of--

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,797
Once again, my friend
Katherine Lamberg...

60
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,636
will be singing the part
of Dorkus the maid.

61
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:25,270
Oh, and she brought her picture
and résumé...

62
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,973
in case anyone's interested.

63
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,608
l will be reading
the part of Rodrigo...

64
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,083
and stage directions.

65
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:36,612
OK. OK, Rodrigo's just finished
his big ballad...

66
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,647
applause, applause, applause.

67
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,786
That's some story.

68
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,456
lt would take a miracle
for me to ever love again.

69
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:45,987
But miracles can happen.

70
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,294
l've never seen one.

71
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,460
Never?

72
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,435
Well, not for a very long time.

73
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,698
Buck up, Rodrigo.

74
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:54,502
l think you're just about due
for a miracle.

75
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:59,201
They kiss.
Rodrigo exits.

76
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,927
l've heard
that all the world's a stage

77
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,122
And we are only players

78
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:22,157
Acting out
some predetermined page

79
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:26,764
But it is lonely as can be

80
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:32,642
With nobody opposite me

81
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,943
Then

82
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,580
Enter you

83
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,882
Voila, it's showtime

84
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,447
You brought the house down
with a dance and a dum

85
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,617
Diddy

86
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,287
Enter you

87
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:50,489
ln less than no time

88
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,297
La la la la la
la la lum litty

89
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,701
Up went the curtain

90
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,705
My lines felt wrong

91
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:04,301
lntermission seemed so far away

92
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,869
The plot uncertain

93
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:08,972
The scenes too long

94
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:13,111
Life was like
an uninspiring play

95
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,279
But

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,481
Now you're here

97
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,616
We meet stage center

98
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:21,821
l thought my story line
was through

99
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:27,163
Then, enter you

100
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,778
Now you're here

101
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:26,485
We meet stage center

102
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,689
l thought my story line
was through

103
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,424
Then

104
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:35,662
From the blue

105
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:39,729
Enter

106
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:42,298
You

107
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,248
You were great.

108
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,925
l really liked it.

109
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,228
Thanks.

110
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:13,069
But, do you think this is how
the maid would really behave?

111
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,264
Well, this isn't reality.

112
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:18,504
l mean, we're talking about
a maid who belts E-flats here.

113
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,571
l mean, you don't have people
walking down the street...

114
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:23,844
bursting into song
and dancing, right?

115
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,373
Except maybe
in the West Village.

116
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,612
Ha ha, just kidding.

117
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,917
Anyway, Gabriel,
you made your point...

118
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:32,015
but it's still important
that the writer tell the truth.

119
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,216
l mean, ''Enter you''?
l don't know.

120
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,229
l mean, she's just been kissed.

121
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:38,594
Have you captured
that feeling you get...

122
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,623
after a really great kiss--
the best kiss you ever had?

123
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,863
lt's exciting,
and it's terrifying...

124
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,029
and it's sexy and...

125
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:48,097
and maybe you think
you could fall in love.

126
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:49,472
You know what l mean?

127
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,104
Well, you know,
Rodrigo and Dorkus just met.

128
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:56,513
l mean, if we were talking about
how people really behave...

129
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,744
l can't have them falling
in love on the first night.

130
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:01,015
That wouldn't be believable.

131
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:03,454
Well, not if you don't
believe it.

132
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,722
l mean, why is she singing this?

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,387
Would you sing it?

134
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:17,135
l hope l didn't
embarrass you in there.

135
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,638
No more than l embarrassed
myself presenting the song.

136
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,766
He gets funny when his songs
don't go over on the first try.

137
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,299
Oh, don't do that.

138
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:25,572
He's got a copy at home.

139
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,240
Listen, the best advice
anybody ever gave me...

140
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,714
l was writing a libretto...

141
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,580
for a musical version
of ''Satyricon.''

142
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:32,949
l was having a little trouble...

143
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:36,444
getting into ancient Rome
and sex orgies, bestiality--

144
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,649
This was in college.

145
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,784
So, this professor tells me that
l should wear silk underpants...

146
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,318
and eat pomegranate seeds
out of a goblet.

147
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:45,228
-Silk underpants?
-lt changed everything.

148
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:48,291
Gabriel, you gotta grab life
by the balls.

149
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,131
You gotta try
for the unexpected.

150
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:53,002
lt's the only way
to get the good stuff.

151
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,104
They're just jealous.
You didn't flop.

152
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:01,113
l know what a flop feels like,
and this definitely was a flop.

153
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,308
You're too sensitive.
Forget about it.

154
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,817
l put a ticket for my show
tonight under your name.

155
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:10,118
lt's a comp, so don't let them
intimidate you into paying.

156
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:13,282
Can you put these
in your backpack?

157
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,954
-So, what do you want to do now?
-l don't know.

158
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,623
-What's that?
-Just something someone gave me.

159
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,792
Some gay bar that charges
three bucks for a Diet Coke?

160
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,893
l will see you at your show,
OK, Katherine?

161
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,165
Where are you going?

162
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,401
l thought we could grab
a chicken Caesar at Cozy's.

163
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:12,477
What?

164
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,952
l said hey.

165
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,923
What do you do?

166
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,800
What do l do?

167
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,367
Writer.

168
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,302
What do you write?

169
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,142
Musicals.

170
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,584
l feel really lame
telling people that...

171
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,951
because it makes me
seem like a queen...

172
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,081
which l don't think l am...

173
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:54,252
but it wouldn't matter
if l was anyway.

174
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,761
Except, l'm not.

175
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:00,831
You got a boyfriend?

176
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,771
Would l be here
if l had a boyfriend?

177
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:09,105
l've got one.

178
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,177
Really?

179
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:13,701
And where is he?

180
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,236
He's at home.

181
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,511
You want to come over?

182
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,211
We don't live far from here.

183
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,583
l think l see a friend.

184
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:14,231
You should be dancing up there!

185
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,303
lt's kind of loud!

186
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,311
You could!

187
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:22,473
You want to?
l know the owner.

188
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,506
No, thanks.

189
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,577
Diet Coke with lime.

190
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,415
Do you do that?

191
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,788
What?

192
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,986
Are you a go-go boy?

193
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,052
l used to be.

194
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,620
Too much beer.

195
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,662
But you'll see me up there again
someday.

196
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,983
l don't know how to dance.

197
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,961
Not like that.

198
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,930
You just got to do it, man.

199
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,124
Watch.

200
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,499
Yeah, you just gotta do it, man.

201
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:56,736
Does it pay well?

202
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,107
lt depends.

203
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,112
You see, you work for tips.

204
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,137
Sometimes you make a hundred...

205
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:05,048
and if they like you,
you make a hundred and fifty.

206
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,520
And...if you do
the other stuff...

207
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,350
Shove off, baby.

208
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,520
That's all you're getting
from me tonight.

209
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:23,460
Do you do the other stuff?

210
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:27,598
No, not since l found Jesus.

211
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,656
You're cute as shit.

212
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,690
You live around here?

213
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:17,201
Yeah, but my roommate
will be back in about two hours.

214
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,507
You can do a lot in two hours.

215
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,612
Hi. l'm--l'm Gabriel.

216
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:28,847
Mark. l'm Mark.

217
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,624
Wow, this is really awkward.

218
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,858
l said this is awkward.

219
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,058
Which way?

220
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,247
Which floor are you on?

221
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,757
Five.

222
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,818
lt's just one more flight.

223
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,834
This is it.

224
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,641
lt sticks sometimes.

225
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,458
Oh, babe, you scared me.

226
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,526
l hope you're not allergic.

227
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:49,965
Why are you here?

228
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,333
l left three messages.

229
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,964
l'm using your computer,
updating my résumé.

230
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:03,038
What are you guys up to?

231
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:05,482
Just hanging out.

232
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,913
Oh, uh, well,
l need to get to my show...

233
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:12,719
as soon as this
is done printing.

234
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:15,056
ls this a bad idea?

235
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,085
No, no. lt's a good idea.

236
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,461
Really.

237
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,834
Hi. l'm Katherine Lamberg.

238
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,462
l'm an actress.

239
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,235
We don't have any chairs, so...

240
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,415
Maybe l should go.

241
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,261
This won't take too long.

242
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,733
How many résumés
are you printing?

243
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,827
A hundred and fifty.

244
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,649
l'm in an all-female production
of ''Salome''...

245
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,210
set in a women's penitentiary.

246
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,380
lt's non-equity.

247
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:19,050
That sounds great.

248
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,422
Really?

249
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,223
l'm a slave, but l understudy
John the Baptist.

250
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:24,854
There's a performance tonight
at midnight.

251
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:27,229
Maybe you could come
with Gabriel.

252
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,564
Maybe. Uh...

253
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,568
You two are roommates?

254
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,138
But we're very close.

255
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,371
l even take care of his dog.
Trixie.

256
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:43,370
l live with this guy--Rich.

257
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,883
He's straight.

258
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,043
Gabe, l talked to my mother.

259
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,556
She called you
my boyfriend again.

260
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,080
lsn't that funny?

261
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,059
That's funny.

262
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,584
She still calls you that...

263
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,927
even though we haven't been
dating since high school.

264
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:01,125
We weren't really dating.

265
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,930
Ask anyone from El Camino.
They'll say we were.

266
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:06,460
We went to one prom
back when l thought l was--

267
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:07,995
Thought he liked girls then.

268
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:12,671
And l was always wondering
why l was making the first move.

269
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,201
l thought it was me.

270
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:15,508
l told my mother Gabriel's gay.

271
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,412
And she was, like,
''Oh, really? You never said.''

272
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:20,282
l was, like, ''Didn't l mention
he's a musical theater writer?

273
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,755
''Hello! Do l have
to spell it out for you?''

274
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,313
That was a million years ago.

275
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,621
You know what Gabe
used to call me?

276
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,685
Puss. You're so kooky.

277
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,288
l had this James Bond thing,
you know, uh...

278
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:34,492
Octopussy, Pussy Galore.

279
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,161
Hmm. l didn't like it
when other people said it...

280
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,194
but it was OKwhen Gabe
called me Puss or Puss-Puss...

281
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,365
or Pussy.

282
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,272
Actually,
l didn't really like Pussy.

283
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,003
Do you have any nicknames?

284
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,376
Beer Can.

285
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,206
Did you used to drink a lot
in college?

286
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:55,316
Gabe's writing a part for me
in his musical--the maid.

287
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,652
lt's actually a very big part.
lt's really good.

288
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,555
l sing all his songs.
He's a wonderful writer.

289
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,956
You're so very talented.

290
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:04,485
l don't know how l feel about
writing musicals right now.

291
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,090
l just know you're gonna be
the next Andrew Lloyd Webber...

292
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,793
or Stephen Sondheim
or something.

293
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:11,098
l spent the last eight years
of my life writing...

294
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:14,037
in a genre that's been dying
a slow death since ''Gypsy.''

295
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,734
He's a golden boy.
He really is.

296
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,139
You love musicals.

297
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,803
l used to.

298
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:23,747
Musicals are way too contrived
and phony and campy and stupid.

299
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:25,306
l don't even know
why l write them.

300
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,578
You write songs?

301
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:30,619
The music, too?

302
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,756
And you...play the piano?

303
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,920
Let's do a number!

304
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,398
Just one. He'll love it.
His songs are so great.

305
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,060
Katherine, l don't think that
Mark's interested in my songs.

306
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,195
Do one.

307
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,365
Really?

308
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,534
Yeah.
l'd like to hear one.

309
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:51,838
See?

310
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,272
All right. One number,
and then you're leaving.

311
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,374
-Cross your heart?
-Cross my heart.

312
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,285
God, l have to get
to my show anyway.

313
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,650
Oh, this is so fun.

314
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,212
l tell ya, if Harold Prince
heard this...

315
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:14,525
l've heard that
all the world's a stage

316
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:17,227
And we are only players

317
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,932
Acting out
some predetermined page

318
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:26,237
But it is lonely as can be

319
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:32,946
With nobody opposite me

320
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:34,919
Then

321
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:38,622
Enter you

322
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:40,648
Voila, it's showtime

323
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,489
God, l'm sorry, but that dog...

324
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,430
You sing.

325
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,060
No, l sing his songs.

326
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,571
You were singing with her.

327
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:57,200
-l was?
-Yeah. Sing it.

328
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,110
Well, Katherine usually--

329
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,407
l'll sing along with you.

330
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:03,175
Let him do it alone.

331
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:14,917
l heard that
all the world's a st--

332
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,951
No. Just where she left off.

333
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:23,560
Enter you

334
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,264
Voila, it's showtime

335
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:27,966
You brought the house down

336
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:31,567
With a dance and a dum-diddy

337
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,044
Enter you

338
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,912
ln less than no time

339
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:39,941
l, uh, still have
to figure out this part.

340
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:43,254
Up went the curtain

341
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:44,880
l've got it.

342
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,193
Perry.
How's it going?

343
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:55,063
l was feeling, you know,
a little torchy...

344
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,534
a little chanteusey, so l
stumbled into a piano bar...

345
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,366
and thought l'd belt out
some of my better numbers...

346
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:00,666
for a bunch of boozy
old fairies.

347
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,106
l knew you wouldn't want
to miss that.

348
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:07,669
Wow. Thanks, but Katherine's
opening in a show tonight.

349
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:09,203
Oh, l understand.

350
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:11,648
But, you know, you could stop by
later, after her show.

351
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:13,150
l'll probably be here
till pretty late.

352
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:14,652
You know where
Eighty-eight's is, right?

353
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,950
Yeah. lt's around the corner
from that play you took me to.

354
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,423
-The one with--
-Greg Louganis, right.

355
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,016
-Right.
-Great.

356
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,354
Friend.

357
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:26,830
You should sing more.

358
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,061
Thanks.

359
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,068
lt's done.

360
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:37,439
No, it's not.
lt ran out of paper.

361
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:42,774
lt's done.

362
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,219
Can you see me out?

363
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,268
Babe...

364
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,436
He's a go-go boy.

365
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:18,746
Well, l'm going.

366
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,684
Your name's on the comp list.
You're gonna be there, right?

367
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:23,711
Yeah. And Rich
is coming back soon. OK?

368
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,723
-One or two?
-What?

369
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:27,224
One or two tickets?

370
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:29,386
Well, is the go-go boy
coming to my show?

371
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:31,020
l don't know.

372
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,997
Put me down for one.

373
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,194
Hmm. You know,
now that my show's opening...

374
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,861
l won't have
to rehearse so much.

375
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,962
Maybe we can finally go see
Helen Reddy sing...

376
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:41,131
and get a baked Alaska.

377
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,733
-OK, great.
-Great.

378
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,106
Bye, babe.

379
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:54,846
Finally.

380
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:33,619
You're really cute.

381
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,438
Maybe if l played the piano,
l could relax.

382
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:55,608
Whatever.

383
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,060
Keep playing.

384
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:04,309
Oh, my God.

385
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,509
Feel good?

386
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:08,909
Do you like that?

387
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,451
All right.

388
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:15,653
And...

389
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:19,855
What if you...

390
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:21,365
went over here?

391
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:23,196
Where?

392
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,260
Down here.

393
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:28,101
There? What do you want me to do
down there?

394
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,836
l've always wanted someone
to go down on me...

395
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,436
while l was playing the piano.

396
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:36,811
Oh, my God, l can't believe
l just told you that.

397
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:38,748
l've never told anyone that.

398
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,512
You want to do it?

399
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:45,847
l'll just scoot out
so you can get in.

400
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:01,035
Uh...just a sec.

401
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:08,835
Yeah, girl.

402
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,476
Backyard.

403
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:14,878
Out in the backyard.

404
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,616
Good girl, Trixie.

405
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:27,628
l'm sorry.

406
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,570
Are you uncomfortable?

407
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:35,004
lt's OK.

408
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,536
What?

409
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,773
l don't know what to play.

410
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:43,246
Does it matter?

411
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,852
Sorry.

412
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:58,954
Do you like show tunes?

413
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:02,728
Uh, l'm a little too nervous
to play classical.

414
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:04,234
lt's your fantasy.

415
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,568
Well, in my fantasy,
l take requests.

416
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,664
Shit!
Get dressed.

417
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:23,943
Gabriel, you just got music
in your bones.

418
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:26,389
What's going on?

419
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,449
l need the apartment.

420
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,290
Mark wanted to hear my songs.

421
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,297
And...you're early.

422
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,732
And...l need the apartment.

423
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,837
She's been in France all summer.

424
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:45,509
Yeah, and you're early.

425
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:48,535
And l told you l needed
the apartment tonight.

426
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,911
Can we talk about this
in the bathroom?

427
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:01,857
What's Trixie doing
on the fire escape?

428
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:03,884
Please. l only need an hour.

429
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:05,088
Please, please, please, Rich...

430
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,428
'cause l really, really want
to do this.

431
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:08,727
l'm really, really into him...

432
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:10,997
and it's not like l get
to do this very often.

433
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:12,469
And l slept out in the hall
last night.

434
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:13,664
Will you--Shh!

435
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,206
What Judy and l have is special.

436
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,371
Special?

437
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,711
And l get the impression
that you disrespect...

438
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:26,615
the love that Judy and l share,
and that hurts.

439
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,915
l expect it from my parents.

440
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:30,978
They don't know.
But you?

441
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:34,082
You of all people, l thought
you would understand.

442
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,390
This is really hard for me.

443
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,691
l don't know how to meet people.

444
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,198
l get really weird...

445
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:43,564
and l make it more important
than it should be.

446
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:48,469
Can't you do it tomorrow night?

447
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:50,269
She's been in France all summer.

448
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:53,175
You can't ask a one-night stand
to come back tomorrow night!

449
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:55,839
Let's flip for it.

450
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,347
Shit.

451
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,850
-Flip?
-Yeah, flip.

452
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:03,944
Heads.

453
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,387
No! Tails!

454
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,793
l have a token.

455
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,990
What are you looking for?

456
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:15,829
Condom.

457
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,526
You want ''New York City
Transit Authority''...

458
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:21,334
or ''Good for one fare''?

459
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,341
Merci.

460
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,603
''Good for one fare.''

461
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,226
Where do you live?

462
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,360
Brooklyn.

463
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:55,265
Yeah. But let's not go
all the way out there.

464
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:57,433
Oh, you have a boyfriend
or something?

465
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:00,273
No, but it's not really
my apartment.

466
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,280
You see, l rent the room
from this old woman...

467
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,942
and she doesn't like me
bringing guys back to the place.

468
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:08,714
lf you're not into this,
l totally understand.

469
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,050
No, l am.

470
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:17,959
Well, what about Wonder Bar?

471
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:20,464
What do we want to go
to a bar for?

472
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:23,695
Right. Right.

473
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:25,999
Yeah.
l usually don't go to bars.

474
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:28,130
Well, l did tonight, but...

475
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:30,607
Well, l go to bars,
but not a lot.

476
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,972
l used to think
l didn't like gay people...

477
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:37,106
but now, actually, l think
that l do like gay people.

478
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,981
There was a time
that l felt like...

479
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,179
l wasn't one of them.

480
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,881
You know? Culturally.

481
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,617
You suck dick, right?

482
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:54,689
Yeah, but what l mean is,
l don't have bleached hair...

483
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,165
and l don't look good
in Lycra...

484
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:58,635
and l don't work out...much.

485
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,798
You ever had a boyfriend?

486
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,503
l wouldn't call him a boyfriend.

487
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:08,478
He was actually something
totally random.

488
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:10,140
l met him in the library...

489
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:11,307
and he was really cute...

490
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,647
and he had this ltalian accent,
which l love.

491
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:15,949
l totally love guys
with accents.

492
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,487
l mean, l was nuts.

493
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:22,288
l mean, l was totally goofy
for this guy.

494
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:26,158
But then, you know, one day...

495
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:29,963
we just stopped having
things to talk about.

496
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:34,332
Then l stopped calling him
to see if he'd call me...

497
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:36,397
and he didn't.

498
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:38,466
lt was probably better anyways.

499
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,570
l mean, l didn't have a bedroom.

500
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:43,513
l mean, what's the use
of having a boyfriend...

501
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,073
if you don't have
a bedroom, right?

502
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,711
Besides, l started getting
this nagging feeling...

503
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:51,449
you know, that he was lying
to me all the time.

504
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:55,351
l don't think he was ltalian.

505
00:36:55,393 --> 00:37:00,763
l actually think he was
Puerto Rican or something.

506
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,427
Well, Gabe,
maybe l should get going.

507
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:06,630
Uh, wait! Uh...

508
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,333
l do know this one guy.

509
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:16,370
From my writer's workshop.

510
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:19,042
Well, l don't know.
Maybe we could, uh...

511
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,846
go to his place.

512
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,944
Great. Call him.

513
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:25,751
He's not at home, actually.

514
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,486
He's at a piano bar.

515
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:35,195
l told my friend, the writer

516
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,167
How happy l would be

517
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,533
lf he'd write an opening number

518
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:42,005
Especially for me

519
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,235
But when he had it finished

520
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,539
lt came as quite a shock

521
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,546
He handed me a song titled

522
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,207
How do you like my...

523
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,712
l said, ''You can't do that
in public''

524
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,345
l said, ''Even l wouldn't dare''

525
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,481
So he made a few small changes

526
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:06,555
Now l can sing it anywhere

527
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:13,703
Como te gusta mi pinga

528
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:16,298
En tus pantalones

529
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:18,775
Como te gusta mi pinga

530
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,801
Y mis cajones

531
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:24,576
lt's the same old thing
in the same old hole

532
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,880
But when you say it in Espanyol

533
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:28,818
lt sounds divine

534
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,820
Como te gusta mi pinga

535
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:36,622
Es muy caliente

536
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:38,993
Como te gusta mi pinga

537
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,260
Es grande plenty

538
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:43,130
You don't go around

539
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,896
Shouting, ''You're well-hung''

540
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,029
But when you do it
in another tongue

541
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:49,437
lt's just fine

542
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:52,238
When the hour's late,
and l don't have a date

543
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,938
And l feel that l can't go on

544
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,311
l lift up my head,
and l stick out my chin

545
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:59,475
And l talk like

546
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:03,146
Montalban

547
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:05,451
Como te gusta mi pinga

548
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,050
lt sounds so neato

549
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:10,617
Like a warm quesadilla

550
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:13,688
Or a pork burrito

551
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:16,359
lt's the same old cheese
and the same old meat

552
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,767
But when it has a Latin beat

553
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,134
lt's OK

554
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:23,663
Como te gusta mi pinga

555
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:28,645
Olé

556
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:33,481
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

557
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:35,611
And thank you
to my favorite piano man--

558
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:38,178
Mr. Lester Sinclair.

559
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,954
This makes me seem really
desperate, and l kind of am.

560
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:46,930
Anyway, it's a long pathetic
story you don't want to hear...

561
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:51,196
but l met this guy,
and we don't have a place to go.

562
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:54,727
Oh, l want to hear this story.
Where is he?

563
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:56,296
He's cute.

564
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,607
-He's a go-go boy.
-No.

565
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:04,845
l can't believe
l'm asking you this.

566
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,281
What?

567
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:09,878
But, uh, you've got your place
to yourself now, right?

568
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,684
Gabriel, you tramp.

569
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,782
Of course you can use my co-op
for your little love antics.

570
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,156
Someone should.

571
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:17,491
But you got to promise
not to break anything, OK?

572
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,226
Gabriel tells me
you're a go-go boy.

573
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,565
-That must be fun.
-lt's a blast.

574
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:28,868
So how often do you participate
in three-ways or four-gies?

575
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:30,874
-l'm doing research.
-For what?

576
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,399
My Casanova musical.
Mark, three-ways or four-gies?

577
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:35,742
Uh, sometimes.

578
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,044
What kind of guys do you usually
pick up, or do you hustle?

579
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,073
No. l don't hustle.

580
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,244
l bet you wouldn't object...

581
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,082
if l slipped a ten-spot
in your undies.

582
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,114
So what's your type?

583
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,558
lt varies.

584
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:53,052
lnteresting. They aren't all
like Gabriel, then?

585
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:55,292
Once l dated this guy from Yale.

586
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,459
He was in the glee club.

587
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,901
-A Whiffenpoof!
-You heard of them?

588
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:00,631
l can't resist a lyric baritone.

589
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,571
ln fact, l've dated
three Whiffenpoofs...

590
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,837
four Tigertones,
a Crocadillo...

591
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,140
and two members of
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

592
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:08,304
So you liked this Whiffenpoof?

593
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,974
Yeah. He was really great.

594
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:13,609
l bet you broke his heart.
All Casanovas do.

595
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:14,982
Um, you know.

596
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:18,011
Be careful
with a musician's heart.

597
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:19,955
We're fragile.

598
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,128
So can me and Gabe go back
to your place and screw around?

599
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,498
My apartment's
just up in Chelsea.

600
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,004
Would it be OK if you used
the futon in the living room?

601
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,801
l feel a little weird
about the bed.

602
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,000
-lt's fine.
-Good.

603
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,668
How long do you expect
this might take?

604
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,370
l wasn't planning
on coming back yet.

605
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,572
l could go out and let you in...

606
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:44,342
and then go back out
for maybe two hours.

607
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:46,816
To tell you the truth,
l wanted to get sauced tonight.

608
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,546
Who just broke up
with his boyfriend?

609
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,520
-Sorry.
-No, l don't want any sympathy.

610
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:52,614
l just want to forget about him.

611
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,557
lt's good you boys
are coming over, you know?

612
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:57,288
My place hasn't seen any action
for two weeks.

613
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:58,727
But l wanted it.

614
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:00,196
-You dumped him?
-No.

615
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:01,357
He dumped you?

616
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,094
Well, l made him dump me.

617
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:04,999
We were crying,
and he asked me what l wanted.

618
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:06,970
And l said, ''l want you
to break up with me!''

619
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:08,471
l didn't expect him to do it.

620
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:12,033
Three years--l'm single for
the first time in three years.

621
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,873
God, l want him back.

622
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,742
What am l saying?
l don't want to see him again.

623
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,078
Just his sweaters. l bought
most of those sweaters anyway.

624
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,174
Before he met me,
he had two decent sweaters.

625
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,617
Well, three. Maybe four.

626
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:22,983
Let's not talk about this, OK?

627
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,146
Let's not talk about it.

628
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:26,088
Gabriel presented his song
in class today.

629
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:29,388
That peach who sings
your songs--Boy, is she loud.

630
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,622
l told him he needed
to grab life by the balls...

631
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:33,254
but l never expected...

632
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:34,730
Well, just look at you.

633
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,665
That song is very good, though.

634
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:37,827
Thanks.

635
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,337
Pastichey, but l like that.
How does that begin again?

636
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,862
-The verse?
-Yeah. How does that go?

637
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,272
l've heard
that all the world's

638
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,242
Cut it.
No one wants to hear that.

639
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:48,302
-Cut the verse?
-Honey, get it out of there.

640
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:50,644
Just go to the chorus.
That's the fun part.

641
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:51,909
But what about all the setup?

642
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:53,814
Gabriel!
Songwriters have been doing...

643
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:56,012
the verse-chorus thing forever.
lt's tired.

644
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:57,281
Be a maverick.

645
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:58,618
What's the function of a verse?

646
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:00,248
To kill time
till we get to the chorus.

647
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,781
During the verse, we wait.

648
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:04,420
We are waiting for the chorus.
Just give us what we want.

649
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:05,759
Chorus, chorus, chorus!

650
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,263
Oh, my God, there he is!

651
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:09,232
l'm sorry, Gabriel.
He's cuter.

652
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:10,427
What, is that--

653
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:13,699
My ex. Please let him see me.
Please let him see me.

654
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,103
-Come here.
-What--

655
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:30,813
Hey, how have you been?

656
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:33,119
Really great.

657
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:35,418
You got a haircut.

658
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:39,921
lt looks nice.

659
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,634
l don't want to interrupt.

660
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:47,194
Oh, no, you're not.

661
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,397
lt's nice to see you.

662
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,940
l'd like to talk to you
sometime.

663
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:00,346
Hi. l'm Mark.

664
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,144
How you doing?

665
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:03,312
l've been better.

666
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:05,822
You know, meeting this guy...

667
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:08,825
has been one of the luckiest
things that ever happened to me.

668
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,121
Really?

669
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:12,857
Are you two...dating?

670
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:14,797
Dating?

671
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:16,060
Him?

672
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:18,659
We're not...dating.

673
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:20,068
Absolutely not.

674
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,197
Not in the romantic sense.

675
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,367
l mean, this thing between us,
it's purely animal.

676
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:26,569
Right, stud?

677
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,339
He's an animal.

678
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,814
l see.

679
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:35,979
Yeah, but we discovered
we're both out-and-out tops...

680
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,783
so we're makin'
the rounds tonight...

681
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:40,757
lookin' for a couple
of hot bottoms.

682
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,019
We got one.

683
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,353
Did l say you could talk?

684
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:48,465
-No, what?
-No, thank you?

685
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,023
-No, sir!
-No, sir.

686
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,362
He's still in training.

687
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:06,879
We fit.

688
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,043
l know.

689
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:09,814
We do. We fit.

690
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:13,824
Are you still staying
with that choreographer?

691
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:17,988
Yeah.
l haven't found a place yet.

692
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:19,223
We should talk.

693
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:20,525
Can l come over?

694
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:25,762
lt's OK.

695
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,202
Work this out.

696
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,365
Talk.

697
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:30,840
Yeah. Talk.

698
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:33,608
Sir.

699
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:49,218
That was nice.

700
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,420
What?

701
00:45:51,328 --> 00:45:53,125
That.
What you just did.

702
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:54,688
l didn't do anything.

703
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,194
Come on.

704
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,999
Ten minutes, ladies.

705
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:05,406
Oh, my God.

706
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:08,241
Everyone l know is here tonight.

707
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:09,871
Oh, how sweet.
You have to read this.

708
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,472
They're from
an old boyfriend of mine.

709
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:12,914
Oh, l wonder if he knows
that my new boyfriend...

710
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,542
is here tonight, too.

711
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:15,882
Oh, my God.

712
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,151
Oh. Oh, give those to her.

713
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,925
Have a great show, everyone.

714
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,334
l think l know
who these are from.

715
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:34,064
-Who?
-Gabriel.

716
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:35,868
Oh, is that your boyfriend?

717
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:41,843
They're for you.

718
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:44,143
Oh, no, that's OK.
There's no more room.

719
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:45,409
You can keep them.

720
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:46,643
Thanks!

721
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,296
What?

722
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,166
She's watching us.

723
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:07,534
Who is?

724
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,499
So?

725
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:13,976
l think she's lonely.

726
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,411
No, she's not lonely.
She's--No.

727
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,247
l'm going to feed her.

728
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:20,773
She looks hungry.

729
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,049
Here, Trixie.

730
00:47:39,537 --> 00:47:40,697
Do you have any menus?

731
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:42,228
l think l'm hungry.

732
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:44,070
You're always hungry.

733
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,133
You're always horny.

734
00:47:54,652 --> 00:47:55,778
He's with me.

735
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,081
Don't we need our hands stamped?

736
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,097
Here, sexy.

737
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,936
-Hey, you never call me.
-Yup.

738
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:16,599
You want something to drink?

739
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,130
No, thanks.

740
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,142
Crowded.

741
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:28,344
Aren't you hot?

742
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,506
Hey, girl!

743
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:12,811
Dino!

744
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,785
Ooh, man,
l am fucking horny tonight.

745
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,912
l better get laid,
that's all l'm saying.

746
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:19,115
lt shouldn't be too hard.

747
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:23,326
-l got a tattoo yesterday.
-What?

748
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,691
A tattoo on my ass.

749
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:26,389
You got to see it.
lt's so cool.

750
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,455
lt's hot in here.
Are you hot?

751
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:30,933
Down, boy.
You're wasted.

752
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:32,367
Totally trashed.

753
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:33,631
Do you need to sit?

754
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,161
No. l want to stand
here with you.

755
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,366
And you.

756
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:42,568
l forgot to put ointment on it.

757
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:43,841
My tattoo.

758
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:45,644
lt's so cool.
lt's a sailor--

759
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,946
total beefcake.

760
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:51,079
l can't see it without a mirror.

761
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,918
Where's the bathroom?

762
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:54,981
-What?
-The bathroom.

763
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:56,583
Back there.

764
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:21,741
Where'd you pick up Priscilla?

765
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:25,184
What a drag.
Girl needs to loosen up.

766
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,247
Yo, leave him alone.

767
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:30,383
Let's get out of here
before he comes back.

768
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,622
No. A friend invited me
to a party in Tribeca.

769
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:34,961
Yeah? Which friend?

770
00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:36,192
Some rich guy.

771
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:38,394
Look, l'm not into hanging out
with a bunch of party burnouts.

772
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:40,027
Aw, it's not like that, baby.

773
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,264
lt's yummy.

774
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:14,462
So, are you and Mark boyfriends?

775
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:17,540
l'm sorry?

776
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,337
What's your name?

777
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:27,744
As in, ''Blow, Gabriel, blow''?

778
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:29,615
l've heard that before.

779
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:31,450
Yeah, well...

780
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,012
l'm Miss Coco Peru.

781
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:40,886
So, is Mark your boyfriend
or just a trick?

782
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:45,460
l don't know what we are.

783
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,470
Oh, l've heard that before.

784
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:55,811
Look...

785
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:57,245
l'm not one to gossip.

786
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:58,509
lt's not my nature.

787
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:00,847
Truth.

788
00:54:00,884 --> 00:54:02,681
Now, that's my nature.

789
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,653
Uh, can you stand over there?

790
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,713
A little pee shy?
Oh, don't worry.

791
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:08,418
Miss Coco's here to help.

792
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,854
You look like a nice person.
You do.

793
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:15,160
So, as a truth seeker...

794
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:18,361
l feel it's my duty
to tell you...

795
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:21,701
that Mark is a no-good
fucking piece of rat shit.

796
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:23,262
Don't get me wrong.

797
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:25,138
He's handsome.

798
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:26,972
He's charming.

799
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,500
Huge penis.

800
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:35,408
Oh, believe me, Gabriel, l know.

801
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:41,222
l'd really like to hear this,
but could you--

802
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:43,419
Turn around?
Sure.

803
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:48,256
Yeah, l remember the first time
l met him.

804
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:50,858
lt was two years ago,
Gay Pride Day.

805
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:55,463
l was on the train going home
from the festivities...

806
00:54:55,505 --> 00:54:59,305
and he was sitting
across from me, sleeping.

807
00:54:59,343 --> 00:55:02,278
But he wasn't really sleeping.
Oh, no.

808
00:55:02,312 --> 00:55:04,542
He was pretending to sleep...

809
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:07,379
because he knows he looks like
an angel when he's sleeping...

810
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,510
and not the Antichrist
he really is.

811
00:55:09,553 --> 00:55:12,044
And even though l could tell
he was faking...

812
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:13,784
l went along with it.

813
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:16,122
Call me crazy.
l don't know.

814
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,491
Anyway, we started talking...

815
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:21,793
and he gives me some line about
some old lady he lives with...

816
00:55:21,832 --> 00:55:23,891
and he asks if he can
go back to my place.

817
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:25,367
l told him.

818
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,996
l don't invite strangers
up to my apartment.

819
00:55:28,038 --> 00:55:31,007
And then he looks down
at his crotch...

820
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:33,635
and then back up at me,
and he says...

821
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,441
''lt's big, it's beautiful...

822
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,107
''and you're going to love it.''

823
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:40,844
And l said, ''Oh...

824
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:43,148
''all right.''

825
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:46,986
And as he walked me back
to my apartment...

826
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:49,822
on that gay night of nights...

827
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,420
he took my hand gently into his.

828
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:54,327
And for a moment...

829
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,663
l felt like the luckiest
drag queen in the world.

830
00:55:57,701 --> 00:55:58,827
And l fantasized--

831
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:01,838
''Yes. This is it.

832
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:03,100
''This is the man
l'm going to spend...

833
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,835
''the rest of my life with.''

834
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:08,709
l'd be the one to show him
the virtues of a loving heart.

835
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,106
But do you know what he did?

836
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,208
He took that heart,
he tossed it on the floor.

837
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:16,742
With his little Satan hoofs,
he jumped.

838
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:19,745
He jumped hard.

839
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,588
The truth is, Gabriel, when
we got back to my apartment...

840
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,025
he threw me on the bed.

841
00:56:24,061 --> 00:56:25,358
He tore off all my clothes.

842
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:26,987
Will you hold on
one goddamn minute?!

843
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,156
Come on!

844
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:30,029
Jesus Christ.

845
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:33,434
Now l forgot where l was.

846
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,596
Where was l?

847
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:36,936
Threw you on the bed,
tore off all your clothes.

848
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:38,270
Right.

849
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:41,611
So l'm licking his balls.

850
00:56:41,645 --> 00:56:43,112
Next thing l know...

851
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:45,910
he comes in my eye,
and he's out the door.

852
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:47,177
Gone.

853
00:56:47,217 --> 00:56:50,209
You ever get come in your eye,
Gabriel, hmm?

854
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:52,915
lt burns.

855
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:54,856
So, there l was...

856
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:57,621
lying in the middle of my bed
completely naked...

857
00:56:57,661 --> 00:57:00,152
with an eye full of come,
thinking to myself...

858
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,398
And then, the next day...

859
00:57:07,437 --> 00:57:09,166
when l call the number
he'd given me earlier...

860
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,640
it was the Brooklyn
Botanical Gardens.

861
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:12,869
And would believe?

862
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:16,310
They never even heard
of a Mark Miranda.

863
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:18,337
But am l bitter?

864
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:20,781
Absolutely.

865
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:23,215
Let's face it, Gabriel.

866
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:24,845
You are just another
little phone number...

867
00:57:24,888 --> 00:57:26,549
on a dirty cocktail napkin...

868
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,081
shoved into the bottom
of his pocket.

869
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:33,187
Good boy.

870
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,892
But do what you will.

871
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:38,264
l only offer you
this information...

872
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:40,826
because l'm a giver.

873
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:42,031
Who knows?

874
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:43,562
Maybe someday
we'll meet again...

875
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:46,235
and l'll be able
to look at you and say...

876
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:54,373
''l told you so.''

877
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,854
Totally sick, right?

878
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:05,088
Sick.

879
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:15,533
l'm glam, baby.

880
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:18,564
You don't even know
how glam l am.

881
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:22,234
You want me?

882
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:33,916
What's wrong with you?

883
00:58:49,606 --> 00:58:51,403
Good night, Dino.

884
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:52,806
-l'm going.
-What?

885
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:08,417
Where do you work out?

886
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:16,231
Sorry.

887
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:17,790
l'm with someone.

888
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:09,611
Why are you sitting in the hall?

889
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,211
Why'd you come back?

890
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,618
You're upset.

891
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,527
No, no, l'm not upset.

892
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:21,052
We shouldn't have gone there.

893
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,891
No. lt was good we went.
Really.

894
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:28,166
You didn't need to come back.

895
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:29,694
Yes, l did.

896
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:33,409
Can we go in and talk?

897
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:37,111
They're still going at it.

898
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:42,584
Yeah,
so you should probably go home.

899
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:47,820
l can't.

900
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,356
l think l left my keys
in your apartment.

901
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,565
l'll knock.

902
01:01:01,905 --> 01:01:03,463
Shit. Shit.

903
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:04,632
Who's that?

904
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:06,835
Yeah. Who is it?

905
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:08,605
lt's Gabe.

906
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:10,203
We're not finished.

907
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:13,306
Can you come to the door?
l need to talk.

908
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,947
-Sorry.
-What do you need?

909
01:01:18,989 --> 01:01:21,856
Mark thinks he left his keys.

910
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:23,722
Judy, do you see some keys?

911
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,193
Where'd you leave them?

912
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:27,753
l don't know.
Maybe near the bed.

913
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:29,128
l don't see them.

914
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:31,360
Maybe you guys
should just come in and look.

915
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:33,529
lt'll be faster that way.

916
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,800
No. You're not coming in.

917
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:39,667
He can't go home
until he finds his keys!

918
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:42,075
All right,
but you better be gone...

919
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:43,340
by the time
l'm out of the bathroom.

920
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,540
All right.

921
01:01:49,853 --> 01:01:50,979
Can you help us look?

922
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:53,546
Well, where would they be?

923
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,955
l'm not sure.

924
01:01:57,193 --> 01:01:59,252
Did you guys just meet
each other tonight?

925
01:01:59,295 --> 01:02:02,196
Yeah. Can we make this
as fast as possible?

926
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:04,462
And you want to do each other?

927
01:02:08,071 --> 01:02:11,404
Gabriel, how do you know
you can trust this guy?

928
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:13,568
You don't really know
a thing about him.

929
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,635
You're right.
l don't know him at all.

930
01:02:15,678 --> 01:02:18,738
l think it's kind of a turn-on,
don't you?

931
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:21,615
Anonymous sex--
That's pretty hot.

932
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:24,518
Yeah, pretty hot.
Let's just look for the keys.

933
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:27,216
That's the great thing
about anonymous sex--

934
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:28,918
You can say
you're just about anyone...

935
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,357
and your partner can't disagree.

936
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:31,985
Do you want to see l.D.?

937
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:35,593
Well, l do.

938
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,137
Oh, you went to a Soonie school?

939
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:46,540
What'd you major in?

940
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:47,838
Journalism.

941
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:50,539
Well, his name's really Mark.

942
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,343
l don't see them.

943
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:54,350
When you know too much
about a person...

944
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:58,081
sometimes it's hard
to think of them sexually...

945
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:00,954
but when you know someone
only in a sexual way...

946
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,584
it's hard to think of them
as a person.

947
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:04,991
Can l have my wallet back?

948
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:07,724
l want to be
a sex counselor someday.

949
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,356
That's my dream.

950
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:10,991
Great.

951
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:14,970
You know, personally,
as a sexually active female...

952
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:18,064
l find the idea of two men
getting it on incredibly hot.

953
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:20,372
Are you sure they're here?

954
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,071
No, l'm not sure.

955
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:25,377
Can you stand still for a second
and let me explain?

956
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:29,215
You know what they say--
Everyone's bisexual to a degree.

957
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:33,249
But to a degree, everyone is.

958
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:36,690
There's this part in Paris
where everyone's bi--everyone.

959
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,387
There's no straight, no gay--

960
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:39,725
just bi...

961
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:42,731
and anyone who hasn't been
doesn't even know.

962
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:44,027
lt's great.

963
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:46,228
Have you ever been to Paris,
Gabriel?

964
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:49,962
l bet you have,
haven't you, Mark?

965
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,375
Can we just find the keys?

966
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,402
Ooh, it hasn't been
a very good night for someone.

967
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:59,472
You guys done yet?

968
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:00,813
We're looking!

969
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,374
Why are you so upset, Gabriel?

970
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:03,578
l'm not upset.

971
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:06,316
OK, l'm upset.

972
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:07,880
Do you want to talk about it?

973
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:11,784
Well, that's valid.
Mark?

974
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:12,988
l'm sorry.

975
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:14,462
We never should've gone
to that club.

976
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,362
You were kissing him.

977
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,268
Dino's this guy
l used to date...

978
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:21,634
and, actually,
he was kissing me...

979
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:23,969
but, technically, you're right,
and l'm sorry.

980
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:26,669
l don't usually go there
with anybody.

981
01:04:28,044 --> 01:04:30,308
Especially not somebody l...

982
01:04:33,983 --> 01:04:35,348
l don't know
what's happening tonight...

983
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:37,683
and l don't know
how you feel about me.

984
01:04:39,055 --> 01:04:41,114
Gabriel,
l think now is a good time...

985
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:43,421
for you to verbalize
your feelings.

986
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:44,585
Why did you just leave?

987
01:04:44,627 --> 01:04:46,322
Why didn't you say anything
to me?

988
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:50,257
l pay rent here, too, you know!

989
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,962
Gabriel, maybe Mark deserves
to know why you left...

990
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:54,492
without telling him.

991
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,572
l left because
of what the drag queen...

992
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:58,767
in the bathroom told me.

993
01:04:59,943 --> 01:05:01,843
There was a drag queen
in the bathroom?

994
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:04,039
Here we go.
What did he say?

995
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,174
He said a lot,
but the gist of it...

996
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:09,117
was that tonight was
just a whole routine for you.

997
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:10,642
-What?
-Tonight.

998
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,086
lt was all lines.

999
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:14,055
''Oh, look at me.
l'm sleeping on the subway.''

1000
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,785
l was tired.
You didn't have to stare.

1001
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:17,190
This old lady--

1002
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:19,058
l don't like bringing guys
back to my place.

1003
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:20,995
And so what?

1004
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,760
l was trying to pick you up.

1005
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:26,867
Well, it worked.

1006
01:05:26,903 --> 01:05:28,461
Why is that such a problem?

1007
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:29,835
Why were you listening to him?

1008
01:05:29,872 --> 01:05:31,464
l didn't have much of a choice.

1009
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:34,839
-l slept with him one time.
-He mentioned that.

1010
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:37,004
Did he also tell you
he videotaped it?

1011
01:05:37,046 --> 01:05:38,240
Oh, shit.

1012
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:40,146
Yeah.
Without telling me.

1013
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,742
And then right when
l'm about to, you know...

1014
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:45,981
Orgasm?

1015
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:48,286
Right. He tells me
to move into the light...

1016
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,951
and l figured it out,
so l grabbed the tape...

1017
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:51,358
and l got the fuck out of there.

1018
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:54,192
Well, he didn't say that--

1019
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,697
about the video--

1020
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:57,199
but he said you left.

1021
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:02,367
You know, this whole night
should've been over hours ago.

1022
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:04,498
lt's gotten
way too complicated.

1023
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,940
l just keep waiting
for the other shoe to drop...

1024
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:09,342
because l know that you're
just going to dump me...

1025
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,869
like you dumped
that Whiffenpoof.

1026
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:14,011
What the hell is a Whiffenpoof?

1027
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,608
A singer!

1028
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:21,517
l feel stupid
spending this entire evening...

1029
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:23,718
looking for a place
just to get off.

1030
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,250
Oh, is that all we were doing?

1031
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:26,887
That's all l was doing.

1032
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:29,591
Really?

1033
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:30,894
Definitely.

1034
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,630
You know...

1035
01:06:38,508 --> 01:06:40,635
l know l picked you up
on the subway and all...

1036
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:43,077
so l don't know why
you'd be any different than...

1037
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:46,838
l don't know.

1038
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:50,511
l thought there was
something more going on tonight.

1039
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:58,292
And just for the record,
the Whiffenpoof dumped me.

1040
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:09,502
Judy, your sheet slipped.

1041
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,564
Aw, shit.

1042
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:13,768
-Cover yourself.
-Would you lighten up?

1043
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,107
Your titties are hanging out.

1044
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:17,874
You know, in Europe,
breasts are breasts.

1045
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:19,973
They're very natural
and beautiful things.

1046
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:22,109
-Just--
-Would you let me be?

1047
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,277
Put them away, Judy.

1048
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,116
lt's not like anything
would've happened.

1049
01:07:25,154 --> 01:07:27,588
You're not in Paris anymore.

1050
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:30,091
ls this the way you've been
acting the past six months?

1051
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:32,151
Yes. For the past six months...

1052
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:34,026
l've been
touring France topless.

1053
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:35,655
And you want to know something?

1054
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:38,462
Nobody seems to care.
Get over it, Rich.

1055
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:40,833
-What are you doing, Judy?
-What does it look like?

1056
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,997
Can't you see
l'm getting dressed?

1057
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,769
l'm going home to
my grandmother's in Connecticut.

1058
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:47,605
Look, here's the keys.

1059
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,458
l knew you were different
when l saw your hairy armpits.

1060
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:14,658
Judy found your keys.

1061
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:41,913
Are you hungry?

1062
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:04,008
Oh, my God, it's so hysterical
that you guys are here.

1063
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:05,377
lsn't that hilarious?

1064
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:06,540
French fries.

1065
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:07,742
Thank you.

1066
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:10,013
lt's really good you didn't come
to the show tonight.

1067
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:11,747
We were really off.
You want some?

1068
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:15,983
Anyway, the girl
playing John the Baptist--

1069
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:18,493
horribly allergic to gladiolas--
Who knew?

1070
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:20,462
So there's a chance
l might go on tomorrow night.

1071
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:22,088
Didn't we order cheese fries?

1072
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:24,861
Oh, yeah.
Should we tell her?

1073
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:28,995
We're out of Thousand lsland.
l gave you Ranch.

1074
01:10:29,038 --> 01:10:30,164
Oh, well.

1075
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:32,970
l have to tell you
about this really artsy party...

1076
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:35,136
this French-Canadian girl
in my acting class threw.

1077
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:38,408
Everyone there, they wrote,
like, poems or novellas.

1078
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,347
So this one college guy--
He was Asian--

1079
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,146
He gets up with this little
leatherette portfolio...

1080
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:44,846
with a satin ribbon to tie it,
and he's going to read poetry.

1081
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:46,650
But before he starts reading...

1082
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:49,317
he tell us about his fascination
with the human body.

1083
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,656
But he says what
fascinates him even more...

1084
01:10:51,694 --> 01:10:53,218
is what comes out
of the human body.

1085
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:55,321
l know l'm lactose intolerant...

1086
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:57,025
but l really wish
these had cheese on them.

1087
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:59,159
Anyway, evidently,
he's tasted everything...

1088
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:01,431
that's come out
of his body except shit...

1089
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,438
and he says he'll probably
taste that one day, too.

1090
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:04,962
And then he reads
a poem about shit...

1091
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:07,271
so l'm thinking,
this guy really likes shit.

1092
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,437
But then he keeps reading,
and he reads seventeen poems...

1093
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:12,242
all about shit.
Seventeen. l'm not kidding.

1094
01:11:12,281 --> 01:11:14,511
And he's talking about
the smells and the colors--

1095
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,814
Gabe, can you pass me
the ketchup?

1096
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:19,320
l was so relieved
when he got tired of reading.

1097
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:20,913
Then this ethnic woman
stands up.

1098
01:11:20,957 --> 01:11:23,824
She was Native American
or Filipino. l can't tell.

1099
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:25,884
She didn't have a poem
to read...

1100
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:28,795
so she tells us about a problem
she's having--this sex problem.

1101
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,423
She said there's some force...

1102
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:33,094
that's just making her
screw around all the time.

1103
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:34,932
Now all these guys
are after her...

1104
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:37,439
and, l mean, she's not
what l would call sexy.

1105
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:41,102
Not that l'm into women, but
l can tell when a woman's sexy.

1106
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:43,839
l mean, it's not that
she was a skank or anything.

1107
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:46,245
She just wasn't what l would
call sexy, that's all.

1108
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,045
Anyway--This is really funny--

1109
01:11:48,084 --> 01:11:51,281
l drank so much homemade
rose hip iced tea...

1110
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,982
that l really had to pee
in the middle of her story.

1111
01:11:54,023 --> 01:11:55,752
So l go to the bathroom...

1112
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,123
but the bathroom door's locked,
so l'm kind of standing there.

1113
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,720
l'm looking at the wallpaper,
which was giving me a headache.

1114
01:12:00,763 --> 01:12:02,230
Then the toilet flushes.

1115
01:12:02,264 --> 01:12:04,562
The door opens,
and the shit guy walks out...

1116
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,760
and he's smiling.

1117
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:07,962
Not one of those polite
acknowledgment smiles.

1118
01:12:08,004 --> 01:12:10,734
He's smiling,
like he's happy about something.

1119
01:12:10,773 --> 01:12:12,764
All of a sudden,
l didn't have to pee anymore.

1120
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:14,435
How's everything?

1121
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:16,138
Fine.
Everything's fine.

1122
01:12:16,178 --> 01:12:18,646
Want to hear the audition
monologue l'm working on?

1123
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:20,512
No, l have new intentions.

1124
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:24,212
-You really don't get it.
-What?

1125
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:29,182
You have been monopolizing
this entire conversation...

1126
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:30,658
since we got here.

1127
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,328
Look, you're my best friend.
You know l love you...

1128
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:38,424
but right now, l don't want
to hear your audition monologue.

1129
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:41,864
l didn't come here
to have you sit down...

1130
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:45,806
invite yourself over,
and talk about shit.

1131
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:47,775
l was just talking.

1132
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:48,936
l know, but--

1133
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:53,915
Why are you being such a jerk
all of a sudden?

1134
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:56,144
Yeah.
Shit's funny.

1135
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:59,279
Shit's shit. Give it a rest,
you Nancy priss ass...

1136
01:12:59,321 --> 01:13:01,118
and let us enjoy ourselves.

1137
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:07,391
l promise l'll call tomorrow.

1138
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:08,897
l promise l'll see your show...

1139
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:13,334
but right now,
l need to be alone with Mark.

1140
01:13:14,637 --> 01:13:17,128
Please, don't ruin this for me.

1141
01:13:18,474 --> 01:13:20,101
What are you trying to say?

1142
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:22,838
Go someplace else.
Take your girlfriends.

1143
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:25,312
Practice your audition monologue
on them--

1144
01:13:25,347 --> 01:13:27,713
whatever--but please just go.

1145
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:37,956
You know, every time
that you insinuate...

1146
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:40,188
that l should sleep with women,
l feel like--

1147
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,891
-l didn't mean that.
-l don't know.

1148
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:46,163
l feel like l have to respond
respectfully...

1149
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:48,193
because l don't want you
to think...

1150
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:51,502
that l think that it's wrong
or bad or nasty.

1151
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,201
But you bring it up
every five minutes.

1152
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:55,210
lt's the most annoying thing
about you.

1153
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:56,370
Don't get upset.

1154
01:13:56,412 --> 01:13:57,811
l don't want
to sleep with women!

1155
01:13:57,847 --> 01:14:00,611
l'm sorry, Gwen.
l can't tell you why.

1156
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:03,709
You're not that way, that's why.

1157
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:05,653
-Katherine--
-Yes, l can.

1158
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:06,848
l can.

1159
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:10,086
This may be hard
for you to believe, gay boy...

1160
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:11,889
but l am heterosexual.

1161
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:15,230
There are such things as
heterosexuals in this world...

1162
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:16,697
and l am one of them.

1163
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:19,462
But you won't listen to me.
You won't drop the subject.

1164
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:20,935
Just because
it bothers you so much...

1165
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:24,235
it's obvious you have lesbian
issues you're afraid to face.

1166
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:30,470
l have lesbian issues?

1167
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:34,442
l don't have lesbian anything!

1168
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:37,213
God, it's like when my dad asked
why l won't move to New Jersey.

1169
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:38,379
What?

1170
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,446
lt'd take me an hour and a half
to get to an audition.

1171
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,424
Can you imagine my dad saying,
''l can tell by your reaction...

1172
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:44,926
''there's a part of you
that wants to move...

1173
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,518
''but you're afraid to face it''?

1174
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:47,722
Holy wow.

1175
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:49,526
Doesn't anybody here get it?

1176
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:52,090
l'm not a lesbian, l don't
want to move to New Jersey...

1177
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:56,571
and where's the cheese
on these goddamn fucking fries?

1178
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:17,825
Can you let me out?

1179
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:41,678
Hey, Puss.

1180
01:15:45,588 --> 01:15:47,488
l'm sorry, babe.

1181
01:15:47,523 --> 01:15:50,185
l'm sorry that l got so mad.

1182
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:51,523
Well, l'm sorry.
lt...

1183
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:54,819
lt's my fault.

1184
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:59,196
Maybe l am a dyke.
l don't know.

1185
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:01,169
lt'd be a whole lot easier
to get a date.

1186
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,400
Come here.

1187
01:16:11,313 --> 01:16:12,610
Oh, God.

1188
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:16,417
Why can't you be straight?

1189
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:18,784
You don't like any straight men.

1190
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:21,790
l don't know any straight men.

1191
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,084
Kath, are you OK?

1192
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:27,425
Oh, yeah, l'm fine.

1193
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:29,226
You owe me four dollars
for the French fries.

1194
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,233
We're going to my place to watch
a video of tonight's show.

1195
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:32,393
Do you want to go?

1196
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:33,594
Sure. One second.

1197
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:41,939
You better get back inside.

1198
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:44,706
l'm going to put your name
on the comp list for tomorrow.

1199
01:16:47,182 --> 01:16:48,911
l'll be there.

1200
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:51,915
You better, motherfucker.

1201
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:18,878
Tonight's been a mess.

1202
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:25,619
But, you know,
some of the mess...

1203
01:17:25,654 --> 01:17:28,179
l did have
a good time tonight...

1204
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:33,125
even though, you got to admit
it was really a mess.

1205
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:39,093
You know, l would've invited you
back to my place, but--

1206
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:40,829
Aw, it's all right.
Don't worry about it.

1207
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,837
No. l would have, but...

1208
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,361
the lady l told you about...

1209
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:48,533
She's my mother.

1210
01:17:48,577 --> 01:17:49,976
l live at home.

1211
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:55,874
Thank you.

1212
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:04,215
l have to pee.

1213
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:07,622
Me, too.

1214
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:27,575
We're alone.

1215
01:18:29,385 --> 01:18:30,852
Yeah, finally.

1216
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:36,486
Enter you

1217
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:37,787
Voila, it's showtime

1218
01:18:37,826 --> 01:18:40,488
l hear the music of a

1219
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:42,929
Dance and a dum-diddy

1220
01:18:42,965 --> 01:18:44,091
Enter you

1221
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,430
You're singing it wrong.

1222
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:46,764
What?

1223
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:48,201
Don't sing it.

1224
01:18:48,737 --> 01:18:50,329
lt's a good song.

1225
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:54,675
Shut up.

1226
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,234
Well, it is.

1227
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:00,104
You're being polite.
Shut up.

1228
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:08,988
You really think so?

1229
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,288
Yeah. lt's really good.

1230
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:14,126
Enter you

1231
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:15,494
That's all l know.

1232
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:17,829
You have to teach me the rest.

1233
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:19,766
l need a piano.

1234
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:21,736
We've already established that.

1235
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,968
You know, l think it's good
how this turned out.

1236
01:19:56,472 --> 01:19:57,632
You do?

1237
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,566
Yeah. We got the hard part
over with.

1238
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:03,772
Oh, what about the sex?

1239
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:08,981
What kind of a girl
do you think l am?

1240
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:49,612
Hey, this is Mark.

1241
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:50,948
You got me.

1242
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:52,283
Leave a message.

1243
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:14,137
Enter you

1244
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:16,872
Voila, it's showtime

1245
01:22:17,946 --> 01:22:19,777
You brought the house down

1246
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:23,876
With a dance and a dum-diddy

1247
01:22:23,919 --> 01:22:26,513
Enter you

1248
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:29,023
ln less than no time

1249
01:22:30,926 --> 01:22:32,791
This ugly drama

1250
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,126
Has become

1251
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:36,323
Pretty

1252
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:40,163
Up went the curtain

1253
01:22:40,202 --> 01:22:42,636
My lines felt wrong

1254
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:47,802
lntermission seemed so far away

1255
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:50,073
Applause uncertain

1256
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:52,103
The scenes too long

1257
01:22:52,147 --> 01:22:56,277
Life was like
an uninspiring play

1258
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:59,583
But now you're here

1259
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:01,885
We meet stage center

1260
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:05,051
l thought my story line
was through

1261
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:10,622
Then from the blue

1262
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:15,103
Enter

1263
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:21,872
