It's a great day.

What do you gotta talk about?

90
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:05,538
- We better do in person, you know,

91
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,358
why don't you meet me for lunch.

92
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,175

- Jed.

100
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:42,560
- So what's up?
- Why don't we go inside?

101
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,910
You know, when you two took off to Vegas

102
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,598

103
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,497
Well, I have to empty feeling
inside, know what I mean?

104
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:57,945

106
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,169
- Well, they started playing
the Hollywood Shuffle

107
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,209
over the weekend.

108
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,626

112
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,682
Hey, I am screwed, man.

113
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,404

117
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,872
Look, I'm sorry.

118
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,933
I mean, I know words
don't mean a damn thing

119
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,600
at a time like this.

120
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,901
Come on, perk up.

121
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,464
I got a few more places to send it, OK?

122
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,025
- Forget about it, forget about it.

123
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,602
- Look, if you need a little extra cash.

124
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,902
- I'm not taking any more money from you.

125
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:50,735
No.

126
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:53,501
- OK, but you know where
it is if you need it.

127
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,130
- Yeah, thanks, appreciate it.

128
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,899
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

129
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:58,732
Thanks.

130
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,307

132
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,634
- Jed, is everything all right?

133
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,310
I got something for you.

134
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,010
- Yeah. Well, you better take it back

135
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,279
before the check bounces.

136
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,800
The deal fell through.

137
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,449
We don't have any money.

138
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:35,575
- [Sally] How did it happen?

139
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:38,655
- Marty stopped by, gave me the bad news.

140
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,614
Something happened over the weekend

141
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:41,934
and the whole damn thing fell apart.

142
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:42,767
I told you we should have gone over there

143
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,353
and signed those god
damned papers on Friday.

144
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,951
- You told me that it didn't matter.

145
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:51,071
- I don't know what the
hell we're gonna do.

146
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:53,071
- Hey, it's gonna be OK.

147
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,517
We're really not any worse
off than before Friday.

148
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:59,864
- I had a taste of it, OK?

149
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:03,881
It's just kind of hard going
back to being a a nobody.

150
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:06,881
See things, were gonna be different.

151
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,624
- I know.

152
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,564
It's all right though.

153
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,082
- No, it's not all right.

154
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:14,249
It's not all right for me.

155
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:19,012
- Jed, why don't we go
get a drink, you know,

156
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:22,081
relax and try and think things over.

157
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,473
- Look, if you wanna go get
a drink, we can go to Chicks.

158
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:27,265
- Forget it, I'm not going in there.

159
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,098
- Oh, come on Sally,

160
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:31,074
it's the only place we can drink for free.

161
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,263

184
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,541

Honey, come on over here.

You are gonna love her.

Honey. I want you to meet
my friends, Jed and Sally.

You're a terrific dancer.

- Thank you.

193
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,758
Some people would call it
an art form, write Chick.

194
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:22,738
- You know, you're the best baby.

195
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:25,208
- Well, it would be nice to
hear it a little more often.

196
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,002
- Hey, Nikki, you shouldn't
be so hard on yourself.

197
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:29,070
You're very good.

198
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,436
- You think so?

199
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,269
- Yeah, I watch your, you're good.

200
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,994
- Chick, make me a martini.

201
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,823
- You've already had two.

202
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:46,656
- Shut up.

203
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:47,541
- Honey, I really think-

204
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,320
- I don't care what you think.

205
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,829
You can go up on that stage and strip.

206
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,009
- So how long the two of you been engaged?

207
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:57,388
- 10 days.
- Two weeks.

208
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:59,508
- So, which is it?

209
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:01,438
- You know I'm right.

210
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:02,438
- Two weeks.

211
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,110
- Gotta go.

212
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,519
- Hell of a woman you got there, Chick.

213
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,742
- You know I may be able
to help you guys out.

214
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:16,842
- How.

215
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:19,845
- Let you in on this
little thing I have going.

216
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:21,215
- I don't think so.

217
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:23,023
- [Chick] You don't even know what it is.

218
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:24,533
- I, I know you.

219
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,533
- Come on, let him tell us about it.

220
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,238
- Horse race, I'm going to Vegas tomorrow.

221
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,444
Gonna lay down a bundle.

222
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:34,444
It's a sure thing.

223
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:35,743
It's paying two to one.

224
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:38,602
It's gonna give me a quick 40 grand.

225
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:39,652
They've got it fixed.

226
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,270
- Yeah, that, that's what they say.

227
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,370
- No, it's guaranteed.

228
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,609
Four of the jockeys are in on it.

229
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:48,200
- Well, Chick, man, you're gonna be rich.

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,105
- I do whatever it takes
to get on this one.

231
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:51,965
Beg, borrow, steal.

232
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,587
This is the chance of a lifetime.

233
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,155
- OK, so say we wanna get into this?

234
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,829
Midnight's, the deadline,
five grand minimum.

235
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,297
- Gee, honey, you got five
grand laying around somewhere

236
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:02,899
I don't know about?

237
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,444
- Well, there is money my parents sent us.

238
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,927
We were saving on down
payment for a house.

239
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:09,833
- What?

240
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,083
- Excuse us a second Chick.

241
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,457
Jed, let's do this.

242
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:21,617
- Are you crazy?

243
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:22,782
- Just place the bet.

244
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:24,345
We'll tell Chick we have
the money in the bank.

245
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,633
Even if we don't, the race is fixed.

246
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,125
It's a sure thing.

247
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,339
No one will ever have to know

248
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,240
we never had the money in the first place.

249
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,623
- It is kind of a good idea.

250
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,711
OK, but now what if it doesn't work?

251
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:37,885
What if the horse loses?

252
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,670
- It'll work, I can feel it.

253
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,920
Come on Jed, let's do this.

254
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:47,260
- OK, let's go for it.

255
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,560
You wanna do it.
- Yeah.

256
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,393
- Come on.

257
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,233
OK, Chick, put us down for five-

258
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,066
- $30,000.

259
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,772
- You guys don't have that kind of money.

260
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,718
- Yeah, yeah, we do.

261
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:01,551
Yeah, we do.

262
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:02,597
We just didn't want to, you know,

263
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,879
use the money for the house.

264
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,102
But if it's a sure thing, like you say,

265
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:07,925
we will never have to touch it, right?

266
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,967
- Nothing's ever a hundred percent.

267
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,884
This is as close as you get though.

268
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,648
(Jed imitates swooshing)

269
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,148

- Oh my God, what are we
gonna do with it all, Jed?

278
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,748
- God, I don't know, but
I feel like I, I feel,

279
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,149
I feel like I got the
palm with my hands on it.

280
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,691
- Feel a little bit bad
about lying than Chick,

281
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,040
though, myself.
- Me too.

282
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,787
But hey, even he said it's a sure thing.

283
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,196
- Hey, you're, you're right.

You know what, what he don't
know won't Hurt him, right?

I never knew Chick

286
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:58,112
was gonna be the answer of our problems.

287
00:14:58,112 --> 00:14:59,576
- Jed.
- What?

288
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,461
- Let's hurry up and get home.

289
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:04,119
I have something I wanna give to you.

290
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,341

292
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:22,022
So what are you gonna give me?

293

(zipper unzipping)

294
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,993
(phone ringing)

295
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,567
All right.

296
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:58,789
Yeah, hello?

297
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,739
- Hi, it's me.
- Hey, what's up?

298
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,309
- All bets are in, the race is at four.

299
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,404
I'm leaving for Vegas right now.

300
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,537
- Make sure you call
the, the minutes over.

301
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:08,071
- All right, I, I just wanted
to confirm it with you.

302
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:09,556
Listen, Jed, if you want out,

303
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:11,057
I got somebody I can pass your back to.

304
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,057
- Hey, no, no, no.

305
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:15,407
I, no, we, we want in, man, wanna do this.

306
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,240
- All right.

307
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,526
- Hey, what's the name of the horse?

308
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:18,359
- Morning Glory.

309
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,886
I'll call you as soon as it's over.

310
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,886
- OK, talk to you later.

(Sally yawning)
- Who is that?

312
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:28,990
- It was Chick.

313
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,658
It's leaving for Las Vegas.

314
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,579
He wanted to give us a chance to back out.

315
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:34,812
- What'd you tell him?

316
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:37,009
- I told him we wanted to go through it.

317
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:37,949
- Great.

318
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,738
Go back to sleep.

319
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:40,571
- Sleep.

320
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,310
How can you sleep?

321
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,143
There's 30 grand on the line

322
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:47,748
that we don't even have.

323
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,581
- I can't.

324
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,180
Let's go then.

325
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,878
If we leave right now
and drive really fast,

326
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,049
we can make it in time for the race.

327
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,080
- Really?

328
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,245
- Well, if we stay here,
we're just gonna go nuts.

329
00:16:58,245 --> 00:17:00,389
If we win when we win,

330
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,670

00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,288
Stan, I want you to meet
my friends, Jed and Sally.

357
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:21,017
- [Jed] Hey.

358
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,603
- Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,686
- I'm Sherry.

360
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,394
- Why don't you guys
pull up right here. OK?

361
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,245
It's gonna start.

362
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,662
- Right here. OK?

363
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:31,838
- Looks like you two got in on the action.

364
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:33,279
- Oh yeah, Chick's a friend of ours.

365
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,569
- [Sherry] I hope he's right.

366
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:35,402
- [Sally] So do we.

367
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:39,085
- Well if you need a place
to stay, mention my name.

368
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:43,085
They know me here, they'll
give you a good deal.

369
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,036
- OK, thanks.

370
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:47,133
(bell ringing)

371
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:50,219
- [Race Announcer] They're
up and they're off.

372
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,289
Pack is breaking evenly.

373
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:52,650
It's Morning Glory in the lead.

374
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,069
Morning Glory pulls out by two.

375
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:58,287
Morning Glory, followed by Forever Yours.

376
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,426
Forever Yours moving back by two.

377
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:01,627
Coming up to the first turn.

378
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:03,908
Still Morning Glory in the lead.

379
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:06,064
Moving out and the crowd
is starting to thin out.

380
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:08,480
It's morning glory, breaking away by four.

381
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
Morning glory by four.

382
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,294
Forever Yours in second by two.

383
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:13,127
Coming up back.

384
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,255
- Oh my Jed, we're gonna
win, we're gonna win.

385
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,859
Oh my god Jed, oh my god!

386
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,416
- [Race Announcer] It is Morning Glory.

387
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,983
No, it's Forever Yours, pulling up.

388
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,507
They're going neck and neck.

389
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:25,379
It's Forever Yours, Forever Yours.

390
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,057
Forever Yours is the winner.

391
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,455
Morning Glory in second.

392
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:29,517
- Oh well.

393
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:31,015
Better luck next time.

394
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:31,848
Ta ta.

395
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,458
- You gotta be kidding me.

396
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,955
I lose my own money on this race.

397
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,869
A sure thing, god I can't believe it.

398
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,244
Look, you're in big trouble.

399
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,460
You just better get all the bets.

400
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,543
You got that?

401
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,079
- I'm really sorry, Jed.

402
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,563
- Yeah, well that doesn't
do me much good now,

403
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:52,730
does it Chick?

404
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:58,008
I can't believe I'll let
you talk me into this.

405
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:01,752
You know, the minute that he
suggested this, I said no,

406
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:02,585
because I know Chick.

407
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,042
I know that Chick is full of shit.

408
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,835
And then you had to go and
stick your nose into it

409
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:08,843
and say it was OK to do.

410
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:10,134
- It's not my fault, Jed.

411
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,614
- It was a fluke, Jed,
we all went down on this.

412
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,073
- Look, I've got to be
the biggest freaking idiot

413
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,869
that ever walked on the god damned Earth.

414
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,657
I should have known that my
old buddy here, Chickster here,

415
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:19,539
was involved, and I was
going to get screwed somehow.

416
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,372
And I did.

417
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,101
- Now that you had your little tantrum,

418
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:26,591
I hope you feel better,
but I still need the money.

419
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,424
- Of course, of course.

420
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:28,400
You need the money, yeah.

421
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,233
Yeah.

422
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,521
- I assume you don't
have it on you right now,

423
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,933
so I'll give you to tomorrow
morning to get it to me, OK?

424
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,350
- That's fine, Chick.

425
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,732
- So how about you meet me
at the bar in the casino

426
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:38,023
tomorrow at noon?

427
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,571
- No problem.

428
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,571
- I'm sorry.

429
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,611
- Jed, I have an idea.

430
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,477
- Honey, if I were you,

431
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:51,700
just get as far away
from me as possible, OK?

432
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,311
Just run.

433
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,392
Because he's gonna have men
come and do things to me.

434
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:57,963
I don't know.

435
00:20:57,963 --> 00:20:59,689
- I'm not you, Jed.

436
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:02,363
I love you, no matter what happens.

437
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:05,880
I think it's time we had some good luck.

438
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,820
You're gonna have to trust me though.

439
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,330
- Come on, come on.

440
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,671
- Look, you said you
had a plan, what is it?

441
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,671
- Come on, come on, Jed.

442
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,716
- What are we gonna do here?

443
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,989
- I'd like to have this change into chips.

444
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,105
- Where'd you get that?

445
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,100
- It's our rent money.

446
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,661
Relax, I brought it just
in case I'm emergency.

447
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,851
- How would you like that?

448
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:33,684
- Honey, don't you think

449
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:35,069
we've pressed our luck enough for one day?

450
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,867
- Jed, just let me do this.

451
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:39,916
I know we're gonna win, I can feel it.

452
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,083
In $50 pieces.
- Thank you.

453
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:48,167
OK, we're gonna put all of this
on red and we're gonna win.

454
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,614
Then we're gonna double down
and we're gonna keep winning.

455
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:52,150
And then we're gonna go home
and forget all about this

456
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,586
terrible night.

457
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:56,529
- [Croupier] Everybody
please, place your bets.

458
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,541
- Everything on red?

459
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,458
- No, no, just do half.

460
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:03,957
- [Croupier] All bets are final.

461
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:04,855
- To black, black.

462
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,726
Can I, can I still change the black?

463
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,624
- Quickly?

464
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:08,762
- I, I just feel Black.

465
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:09,845
I feel Black.

466
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:12,525
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

467
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:13,542
- Black, Black.

468
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,617
Black, Black.
- Come on Black.

469
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,039
- Black, Black.

470
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,706
(ball rattling)

471
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,110
Ah shit!

472
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,443
- [Croupier] Red 16. Red 16.

473
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,093
- OK, OK, forget it.

474
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:28,676
Gimme the rest of the chips,
we have to win this one.

475
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:29,509
Black.

476
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,128
- Black, Black, Black, Black.

477
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,795
(ball rattling)

478
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:40,113
- [Croupier] Red. 23, Red 23.

479
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:43,517
- Oh my god, Jed, I'm sorry.

480
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,726
- [Croupier] OK, place your bets please

481
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,262
ladies and gentlemen.

482
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,929
(pensive music)

483
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:56,576
- [Clerk] Sir, this is not a pawn shop.

484
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,875
- Yeah, I know, I know.

485
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:03,263
Look, we got ourselves into
a little bit of a bind.

486
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:04,593
Th these are very expensive rings

487
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:08,593
and I will sell these to
you at a real discount.

488
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:16,075
- These are both beautiful rings.

489
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,449
Clearly bought in better times.

490
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:20,161
- That was my grandmother's.

491
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:23,494
- [Clerk] How much do you want for both.

492
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,634
- I don't know, make an offer.

493
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,970
- I'll give you $3750.

494
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,803
- Three-

495
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:32,940
- I know they're probably
worth more than twice that.

496
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,343
Tell you what, I'll just
hold them for 48 hours.

497
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:37,176
If your luck changes,

498
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:40,992
come back and I'll let you buy
them back for the same price.

499
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,643
- OK?
- Thank you very much.

500
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:44,878
- Take some advice though.

501
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:45,988
Use the money.

502
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:48,558
Pay off whatever it is
you have to pay off.

503
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,208
Don't press your luck, this is Vegas.

504
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,875
(ball rattling)

505
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,327
- [Croupier] Red. 34.

506
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:57,160
- Yes, yes!
(Sally screaming)

507
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,513
- [Croupier] And we have a winner!

508
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,472
Congratulations.
- Thank you God.

509
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,305
- Oh my god.

510
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,391
OK, let's go again.

511
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,446
Everything on red, I can feel it.

512
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:05,446
OK, come on.

513
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,672
- Hello, Roberto.

514
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:09,651
- Good evening, Ms. Landis.

515
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,110
Is everything OK?

516
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,327
- Everything's great.

517
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,415
I feel like playing a
little blackjack tonight.

518
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:15,726
- I can take you to your table.

519
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,276
- Great.

520
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:19,131
Oh, wait, that couple.

521
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:19,987
I recognize them.

522
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:21,491
What do you know about them?

523
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:23,386
- [Roberto] They're causing quite a stir.

524
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:24,571
- Really?

525
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:25,844
How are they doing.

526
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,011
- So far, they're winning.

527
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:33,329
(sultry jazzy music)

528
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:50,785
(gasping)

529
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:06,720
Perhaps I'll play some roulette instead.

530
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,718
(ball rattling)

531
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:10,169
- [Croupier] All bets are final.

532
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:11,086
Here we go.

533
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:14,910
Red 17.
- Yes.

534
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,493
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.

535
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:19,034
- [Croupier] Congratulations.

536
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:19,867
- $15,000.

537
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:25,978
- That would've seemed like
a lot of money 24 hours ago.

538
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:27,870
- We've got 15,000 here, honey.

539
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,641
- Yeah.
- Good evening, Ms. Landis.

540
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:30,474
How are you tonight?

541
00:25:30,474 --> 00:25:31,971
- Just fine.

542
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:34,390
Jed, what is your favorite number?

543
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,454
- My favorite number is lucky number 13.

544
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,121
- OK, $10,000 on 13.

545
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:49,600
- Oh, 34 Red.

546
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,327
Sorry, Ms. Landis.

547
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:59,577
- Oh, well I'd pay a lot
more for a man like you.

548
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:01,075
- I'm sorry, what was that?

549
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:02,309
- Nothing.

550
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,815
You two look like you've had a hard day.

551
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,042
- We have.

552
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,652
- Allow me to do you a favor.

553
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,213
I have a few suites
that are kept available

554
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:11,087
for myself and my guests

555
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:13,999
and I'd like to give
you one for the night.

556
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:15,715
- I don't know.

557
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:18,013
Would you like to?

558
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:19,465
- We still need $15,000 more,

559
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:23,548
but I am kind of tired
and I'd like a hot shower.

560
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,825
Something along those lines.

561
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:29,617
- OK, great, we'd like to.

562
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:32,227
- Great, I am delighted.

563
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:34,060
It's on the top floor.

564
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,604
Have a nice night.

565
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:40,021
(jazzy electronic music)

566
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,957
(Sally moaning)

567
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:16,556
(Sally panting)

568
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,572
(Sally moaning)

569
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:42,405
- Oh yeah.

570
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:06,363
- What time is it?

571
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:09,145
- Hmm?
- What time is it?

572
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,395
- I don't know.

573
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:19,222
Oh, Jesus, one o'clock in the afternoon.

574
00:28:19,222 --> 00:28:20,541
- We were supposed to meet Chick at 12.

575
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,374
- I know, I know.

576
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:26,124
Let me call him, I just wanna
make sure it doesn't worry.

577
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:32,321
Hey Chick, hi, it's Jed here.

578
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:35,001
Sorry, we missed you at 12 o'clock.

579
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,491
We'll have the money for
you by this evening, OK?

580
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:38,560
I'm sorry about this,

581
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,865
but I'll call you room back

582
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:41,707
and let you know where to meet us, OK?

583
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:42,707
Thanks. Bye.

584
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:46,607
- What did he say, did he freak out?

585
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,623
- No, he wasn't there.

586
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:49,732
Left the message on his hotel voicemail.

587
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:51,538
- So what do we do?

588
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:52,371
- Get dressed.

589
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:55,022
Go down to the casino and
win 15,000 more dollars.

590
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:58,022
(upbeat rock music)

591
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:06,478
- Here we go.
- Roll it!

592
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,061
- Yes.
- Snake eyes.

593
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,207
That's it, buddy.
- Where do we start?

594
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,040
- [Croupier] Congratulations,
place your bets.

595
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,204
- OK, what we're gonna do this time,

596
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:16,262
we're gonna be small portions
and we're gonna bet smart.

597
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:17,852
Hopefully we'll get on a roll pretty early

598
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,866
and get the hell outta here.

599
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:20,756
- Let's go.

600
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:22,890
- OK, let's go, roll the dice.
- Come on now.

601
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,890
(dice rattling)
(patrons cheering)

602
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:32,220
- Yes, Ms. Landis?

603
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,952
- That couple from last night,
they're back on the floor.

604
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,270
- [Roberto] I already noticed that.

605
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,687
I'm on top of it.

606
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:40,718
- Here we go, big eight!

607
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:49,896
- You're kidding me, right?

608
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:53,556
- No, I just had this little problem

609
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,615
that I was gonna tell you about.

610
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,448
- You're $30,000 short.

611
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:03,983
- This guy and, and his
wife, they took off on me.

612
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:06,046
- Wait a minute.

613
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,134
Is this the couple that
was at the sports book

614
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:09,314
at the casino?

615
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:10,314
- It's them.

616
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:16,622
(ominous music)
- This is not good Chick.

617
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:19,290
'Cause I don't know where they are.

618
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,628
They could be anywhere.

619
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:24,128
However, I know where you are.

620
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,711
(Chick yelling)

621
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,179
Tell me where they are.

622
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:33,377
- You're gonna break my arm.

623
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:36,377
- That's the whole idea, talk to me.

624
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,064
- I don't know.

625
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:41,560
They were supposed to meet
me at the casino by the bar.

626
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,538
- First, you turned me on
to that stupid horse race.

627
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,413
And then you take a
$30,000 bet and it walks.

628
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,778
I gotta tell you something, Chick.

629
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:53,270
I am really unhappy with you right now

630
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,603
so you better think where they might be.

631
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,186
- Stan, I swear to God, I
don't know where they are.

632
00:31:00,186 --> 00:31:04,096
- I don't got no reason to
keep you around anymore.

633
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,743
- [Chick] Stan.

634
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,993
I thought they were OK.

635
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:09,660
- You thought wrong?

636
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:12,596
Put him out of my misery.

637
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:18,631
(punch pounding)
(Chick groaning)

638
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:20,452
(punch pounding)
(Chick groaning)

639
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:22,799
(slap popping)
(Chick groaning)

640
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,943
- Stan, don't do this.

641
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:25,012
Please.

642
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,211
- Shut up.

643
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:27,920
- He's bad luck.

644
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,994
I don't want to see or hear
from that fuck ever again.

645
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:31,827
Do it.

646
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:37,087
(gun ratcheting)

647
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:39,837
Do it.
- Please don't.

648
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,263
(gunfire booming)

649
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,777
- Sherry, I was just
taking care of business.

650
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:08,860
So what can I do for you?

651
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,681
- Well, actually, Stan,

652
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:15,488
that's what I came to talk
to you about, business.

653
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:16,488
You miss me.

654
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,372
- Sure.

655
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,204
- Good.

656
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:26,182
(pensive music)

657
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:31,323
(jazzy electronic music)

658
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:46,310
(pensive music)

659
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:51,032
- [Croupier] Black 15,
Black 15, sorry, folks.

660
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,898
(pensive music)

661
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,477
- We're broke.

662
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:00,772
That's it.

663
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,323
- I can't believe we lost it that quickly.

664
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:06,692
- Well, we did.

665
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:08,711
We got about about a hundred bucks left.

666
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:11,173
That'll be about enough to
get us back to Los Angeles.

667
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,051
- We can't go home, Chick will kill us.

668
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,969
- I don't know what else to do.

669
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:16,886
- We can go to Florida.

670
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:21,281
- No way, you can just forget about that.

671
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:24,332
- I'll call my parents, they
can wire us plane tickets.

672
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:26,748
We can stay there until
we get back on our feet.

673
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:28,199
- Yeah, yeah, I, I can just see the look

674
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,188
on your father's face

675
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:30,959
when he comes to pick
us up at the airport.

676
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,246
That's self righteous prick.

677
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,566
- Don't talk about him like that.

678
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:36,162
What else are we gonna do?

679
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,476
Can't go home.

680
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,135
We certainly can't go to your parents.

681
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:40,968
- I'll tell you what,

682
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:41,973
I'll go back to Los Angeles and get killed

683
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:43,977
before I take a god damn
dime from your parents.

684
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:45,750
Let alone live with them in Florida.

685
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,075
- Well, what then?

686
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:47,908
- I don't know, Sally.

687
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:50,059
But yelling in my face is not gonna help.

688
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,000
- I'm just trying to
figure out our options.

689
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,928
- Look, why don't you just leave me alone

690
00:33:52,928 --> 00:33:54,839
for a little while, OK, I gotta think.

691
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:58,068
- Gladly, in fact, I'll leave
you alone for a long while.

692
00:33:58,068 --> 00:34:00,235
How's that?
- That's great.

693
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:10,178
- Hello.

694
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,249
- Hi, what you live here?

695
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:16,416
- Practically?

696
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,486
You don't look so great, is everything OK?

697
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:22,991
- My wife and I just
lost all of our money.

698
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,187
We came in here, we thought
we could win back enough money

699
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:28,032
to pay back the money we
lost at the horse races.

700
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,384
- That's a bad idea, the
odds are against you.

701
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:32,974
- Yeah, but where else can
you win $30,000 in two days?

702
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:34,761
- I can think of a few ways.

703
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:37,161
$30,000 isn't that much money.

704
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,828
- Maybe not for you.

705
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,657
- I can think of a way that

706
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:44,693
you can get that kind
of money very quickly.

707
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:46,037
- Really, how?

708
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:49,527
- Spend the rest of the
night with me. In my suite?

709
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:50,735
(Jed chuckling)

710
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:51,568
- Yeah.

711
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,687
That's a joke, right?

712
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:55,520
- No joke.

713
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:57,587
- No, I really couldn't.

714
00:34:57,587 --> 00:34:58,420
Nah.

715
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,405
- Well.

716
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:04,171
- Well just, just outta curiosity.

717
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,566
Well how much are we talking about?

718
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:09,066
- $40,000, payable at sunrise?

719
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,002
- Well you know, you know I'm married.

720
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:16,493
- I don't wanna know.

721
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:17,326
Do we have a deal?

722
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,596
- Are you serious?

723
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:19,429
- Totally.

724
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,660
You turn me on.

725
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:32,098
- Well, I've never
cheated on my wife before.

726
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:34,177
- Well, if what you say is true

727
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:35,502
and you're really need the money,

728
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:38,354
well you're probably doing
it for your wife in a way.

729
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:41,425
Plus no one says she has
to find out about it.

730
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:42,984
Right?

731
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:45,142
- She's staying right here in the hotel.

732
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:46,449
You know that?

733
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,646
- Well, I saw you two were in a fight.

734
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,009
Why don't you just tell her
that you spent the night out

735
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:53,176
wandering around thinking.

736
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,501
- $40,000.

737
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,429
- $40,000, uh-huh.

738
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,940
- OK.

739
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
It's a deal.

740
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:13,582
- I'm delighted.

741
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,793
Come with me.

742
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:19,460
(pensive music)

743
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,722
Sorry I took so long.

744
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:38,555
- It's OK.

745
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,343
Why, why are you so dressed up?

746
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:46,634
- Well, I'm paying for it,
so I thank you to indulge me.

747
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:49,404
- OK?
- Is everything all right?

748
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:50,411
- [Jed] Fine.

749
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,244
- Take a look at this.

750
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,503
- It's an incredible view.

751
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:00,586
- Yes, it is.

752
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:04,899
I thought it would be nice
if we just relax, talk,

753
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:06,816
get to know each other.

754
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:08,806
Hope you're thirsty.

755
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:13,473
- Yeah, you know, as a matter
of fact, I'm very thirsty.

756
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:20,159
- So, aren't you gonna
tell me how nice I look?

757
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:22,817
Hmm?

758
00:37:23,735 --> 00:37:26,030
- [Jed] You look very nice.

759
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,228
- Thank you.

760
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:30,145
(glasses clanging)

761
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:33,824
- Can I ask you a question?

762
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,020
- [Sherry] Of course.

763
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,270
- [Jed] Why me?

764
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,542
- That's a very good question.

765
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,625
I don't know.

766
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,993
Why are you with your wife?

767
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:49,612
I mean, why are any two people together?

768
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:52,942
All I know is that when I saw you,

769
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:55,942
I found you completely irresistible.

770
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:01,779
- That's very interesting,
very interesting.

771
00:38:05,272 --> 00:38:08,179
- Are you hungry, can
I ring for some food?

772
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,542
- No, I'm sorry.

773
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,062
Under the given circumstances.

774
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:12,702
I don't think I could
enjoy a meal right now.

775
00:38:12,702 --> 00:38:15,613
- Why, you're not comfortable?

776
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:17,813
- No, I'm, I'm not comfortable.

777
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,821
- Well, that's what the champagne is for.

778
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:23,010
It's to get you loose so we can
get to know each other, hmm?

779
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,843
- Cheers.

780
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,117
Tell you what.

781
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:37,441
You invited to me up
here to fuck you, right?

782
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,093
Well, this bar looks very sturdy.

783
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,610
Why don't you just climb
up here and let's fuck,

784
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,040
get it over with.

785
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,443
What do he say?

786
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:45,526
- I didn't say "fuck me."

787
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,041
I said spend the night with me.

788
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,321
And since I am paying,

789
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:55,012
I will decide what happens
when it happens, and how.

790
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:56,903
Now, sit down.

791
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,782
Figuring how desperate you seemed earlier.

792
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:02,557
I really think that you
could use another drink.

793
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:03,390
Hmm?

794
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:10,820
- Cheers.

795
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,653
- Cheers.

796
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,787
How about another bottle then?

797
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,787
- Good idea.

798
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:31,133
- You're, you're a damn beautiful woman.

799
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:33,744
And I'll tell you what, if I
wasn't a happily married man,

800
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:36,972
I'd probably be enjoying myself right now.

801
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:37,805
- Well, if you weren't married,

802
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:39,646
then we wouldn't be doing it.

803
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,720
That's the whole point.

804
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,553
- What is?

805
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:47,475
- Turning you on when you
don't wanna be turned on?

806
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:51,642
That's what every woman
wants, to be irresistible.

807
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:57,262
You mentioned the sturdiness of this.

808
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:04,284
Well, I assure you it's a
multi-purpose piece of furniture.

809
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:10,797
(Sherry gasping)

810
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:11,630
Touch me.

811
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,365
- [Jed] I got it.

812
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:23,836
- Undo my dress.

813
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:25,086
- There you go.

814
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:27,307
Oh boy.

815
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:41,753
(door banging)

816
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:43,402
- [Stan] Sherry, it's me.

817
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:48,311
(door banging)
Sherry, open up the door.

818
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:51,064
Sherry, I'm gonna smash down
this door, now open it up.

819
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:52,314
- Come with me.

820
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:54,398
- [Stan] Sherry, I know you're in there.

821
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:55,588
Open up the door, now.

822
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,624
(door banging)

823
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:58,457
- Shh.
- Who hell is that.

824
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,592
- [Stan] Who's in there with you?

825
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:00,425
- Stan?

826
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,636
- Who the hell is Stan?

827
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:04,886
- He's the guy that you owe $30,000 to.

828
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,482
- What the hell is he doing here?

829
00:41:10,363 --> 00:41:12,113
What's he doing here?

830
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,186
- I don't, I don't wanna talk about it.

831
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,953
I don't wanna talk about it.

832
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,703
Jed, make love to me.

833
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:23,504
- But.

834
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:26,337
- Just, just, make love to me, OK?

835
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,190

husband left a message for me.

864
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:09,189
Oh shit, oh shit.

865
00:44:10,154 --> 00:44:11,568
- Drank a lot last night.

00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,401

867
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:19,319

- Thank you.

869
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,968
Look, it's well past,

870
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:28,788
whoa, it's well passed dawn here.

871
00:44:28,788 --> 00:44:32,041
Can I get my money so I can go?

872
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,208
- That's fine.

873
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,113
- Oh, oh man.

874
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,978
I have to figure out what
I'm gonna tell my wife

875
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,478
where I got that $40,000 from.

876
00:44:44,455 --> 00:44:46,961
- Who says you have to tell her the truth?

877
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:48,287
Why don't I just tell
you to talk to the bookie

878
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:51,367
and he says he's gonna let the bet slide.

879
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:54,938
- Because somehow I don't
think she's gonna believe that.

880
00:44:54,938 --> 00:44:56,587
- She'd believe you.

881
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:57,420
Trust me.

882
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:03,380
- Well, that's because you're a good liar.

883
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,213
- Thanks.

884
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:07,579
- You can go to your room now.

885
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,531
Money's down in a safe.

886
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:12,639
I'll call you when I have it.

887
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:13,806
- Hey, thanks.

888
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,783
- You're welcome.

889
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:18,454
- No, I really means thanks.

890
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:20,787
I mean, you really saved me.

891
00:45:22,234 --> 00:45:23,067
So,

892
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:26,892
had a good time last night.

893
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:27,809
It was fun.

894
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:30,639
- So did I.

895
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:43,713
- [Sally] Jed, where
the hell have you been?

896
00:45:43,713 --> 00:45:47,201
- Hi honey.
- I've been so worried.

897
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:48,970
I'm sorry, I know I was
mad at you last night, but-

898
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,053
- It's OK, Honey.

899
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:52,696
I was just walking around and

900
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:54,100
you know everything's gonna be OK.

901
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,933
- What?

902
00:45:54,933 --> 00:45:57,882
- Yeah, I was talking to
Chick and Chick said, he said,

903
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:58,982
I'll just take care of the bet for you.

904
00:45:58,982 --> 00:45:59,921
- [Sally] How?

905
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:02,891
- Ah, he just said he was
gonna erase it outta the book.

906
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,037
I guess.

907
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:05,629
- I can't believe it, Just like that.

908
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,732
- Yeah. It's pretty amazing, huh?

909
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,039
So what I think we should do,

910
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,449
let's get are stuff all packed up.

911
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:13,520
Get ready to get the hell outta here

912
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,096
and just forget that this
damn thing ever happened, OK?

913
00:46:16,096 --> 00:46:17,227
- Fine. Let's go right now.

914
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:19,958
- Oh, we have to wait cuz
he's supposed to call.

915
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,305
He's, he's gonna tell me like
if it's OK to go back to LA,

916
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:23,892
if it's safe.

917
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:25,972
(phone ringing)

918
00:46:25,972 --> 00:46:27,555
- I bet that's him.

919
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,603
Hello?

920
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:30,603
- Hello Jed.

921
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,923
It's me, Sherry.

922
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,982
There's been a development,
we need to talk.

923
00:46:35,982 --> 00:46:37,335
- I'm here with Sally.

924
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:38,670
Is there some kind of problem?

925
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,871
- I think it would be better
if we talk down here alone.

926
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:41,704
- Why?

927
00:46:41,704 --> 00:46:43,735
- I'm right near the front desk.

928
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:46,402
I'll tell you when you get here.

929
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,489
(Jed sighing)

930
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:53,481
- What, what is it?

931
00:46:53,481 --> 00:46:55,559
- I dunno, there's a problem,
Chick said, I got a call,

932
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,476
I got a call from an outside phone.

933
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:00,706
OK, what's going.

934
00:47:00,706 --> 00:47:02,474
- I need to talk to you.

935
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:03,557
- Look, my wife is upstairs.

936
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:06,380
You're scared to hell outta
me, now what's going on?

937
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,481
- I was upstairs making some phone calls

938
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:09,866
and I spoke to Stan.

939
00:47:09,866 --> 00:47:13,675
Evidently, he's on some sort
of rampage about the $30,000.

940
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:14,758
You still owe him?

941
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:16,958
- I told you I was gonna pay the guy.

942
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,567
- You don't understand it, do you?

943
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,338
Stan is crazy.

944
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,269
He doesn't like to be walked on.

945
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:23,356
- Whoa, what's that
got to do with a thing?

946
00:47:23,356 --> 00:47:24,917
Like I told you I was
gonna pay the guy today.

947
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:25,750
I didn't walk on him.

948
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,706
- I know, I know.

949
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:29,286
- I told him that you were here,

950
00:47:29,286 --> 00:47:30,308
here and you're going back to LA shortly

951
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:32,440
but he said it doesn't matter.

952
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,669
It's too late.

953
00:47:33,669 --> 00:47:35,021
- Too late.

954
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:37,401
- And Chicks been hurt.

955
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:38,862
- How bad?

956
00:47:38,862 --> 00:47:40,112
- I don't know.

957
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,216
And there's another thing.

958
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:44,034
He said that because you've been late

959
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:45,966
and you put him through so much trouble

960
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:48,383
that you now owe him $50,000.

961
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:52,596
- Jesus Christ.

962
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:53,429
How can he do that,

963
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,262
wow can he do that?

964
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:55,376
A bet is a bet.

965
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,644
I mean, you can't just go
change it a bet like that.

966
00:47:57,644 --> 00:48:00,161
Christ sakes, I'm only two days late.

967
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:01,744
How can he do that?

968
00:48:02,644 --> 00:48:04,284
- I think there's a way
that we can work this out.

969
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,117
- [Jed] How?

970
00:48:05,117 --> 00:48:08,512
- I can just give you the $10,000
in addition to the $40,000

971
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:09,717
that I already owe you.

972
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:11,025
- You, you would do that for me.

973
00:48:11,025 --> 00:48:12,175
- Of course.

974
00:48:12,175 --> 00:48:13,694
If you'd spend the night with me again,

975
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:15,503
I'd give you the money.

976
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:16,883
- No, it's impossible.

977
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:19,074
Sally's upstairs, she's
alone, she's scared.

978
00:48:19,074 --> 00:48:20,534
I can't leave her alone again.

979
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:22,542
- I think I've been pretty fair already.

980
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:24,246
So what's it gonna be?

981
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:25,746
It's just a night.

982
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:33,336
- Ah, OK, look, gimme a couple hours.

983
00:48:33,336 --> 00:48:35,149
I gotta work out something with Sally.

984
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:37,529
- See you in my room.

985
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:40,112
- I'll call you, I'll call you.

986
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,294
Fuck.

987
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:48,056
(jazzy rock music)

988
00:48:56,722 --> 00:48:58,834
- What happened?

989
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:01,766
- Well, let's go sit down.

990
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:04,718
Chick said I have to go meet his boss.

991
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:06,901
Remember that guy at the
horse race, the big guy, Stan?

992
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:07,891
- The real big scary guy.

993
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,502
- Yeah, that's the guy.

994
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:11,784
And Chick said he'll probably put me on

995
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:13,405
some kind of a payment plan,

996
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:15,359
but I have to meet the guy in person

997
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,606
and I'm supposed to meet
him in about 20 minutes.

998
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,246
- What? Where are you going?

999
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:21,493
- I don't know, Chick wouldn't say.

1000
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:23,624
- Jed, I don't want you to
do this, it's dangerous.

1001
00:49:23,624 --> 00:49:25,922
- Honey, what choice do we have?

1002
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:27,824
Look, I'll call you, let
you know what's happening.

1003
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:28,991
OK, I'll, I'll be back,

1004
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:30,669
I don't know, late tonight,
early tomorrow morning.

1005
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:31,773
- No!

1006
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,443
- Look, I'm just gonna go
talk to this guy, Stan,

1007
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:36,126
and reason with the guy.

1008
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:37,348
Chick said everything's gonna be OK.

1009
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:39,033
- Oh, I can't believe it.

1010
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:40,303
And you believe Chick?

1011
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:41,136
- Yeah.

1012
00:49:41,136 --> 00:49:42,408
- Well, I can't take it.

1013
00:49:42,408 --> 00:49:43,758
I'm leaving.

1014
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:45,216
You can do whatever you want.

1015
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,563
- Sally, Sally,

1016
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:49,088
would you just stick with me
a little while longer, honey.

1017
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,266
OK, look, I swear to God after tonight,

1018
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:53,317
everything is gonna be OK.

1019
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:55,224
- Jed, I'm just really scared

1020
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:57,216
that something's gonna happen to you.

1021
00:49:57,216 --> 00:49:58,384
- I know, everything's gonna be OK though.

1022
00:49:58,384 --> 00:50:01,051
I'll be fine, Honey, I love you.

1023
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:03,587
- Jed.

1024
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:06,382
- Look, I gotta go.

1025
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:08,511
I'm really sorry about this.

1026
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,683
- [Sally] OK?

1027
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:11,266
- [Jed] I love you.

1028
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:20,121
(pensive music)

1029
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:30,301
- Things are gonna be a
bit different tonight, Jed.

1030
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:32,652
I've got some excitement planned for us.

1031
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:33,485
Would you get this?

1032
00:50:33,485 --> 00:50:34,318
- What?

1033
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:36,431
- You want me to tell you now

1034
00:50:36,431 --> 00:50:39,833
or do you want it to be a surprise?

1035
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,420
- I'd like you to tell me now.

1036
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,895
- Well, you're a very handsome man.

1037
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:48,156
So we're gonna go downstairs

1038
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:52,125
and you're gonna seduce a
young lady of my choosing

1039
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,565
and then you're gonna bring her up here

1040
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:56,482
and make love to her while I watch.

1041
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:58,985
How does that sound?

1042
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:01,444
- It sounds like I'm not gonna do it.

1043
00:51:01,444 --> 00:51:02,836
- [Sherry] What?

1044
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:04,319
- What?

1045
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,832
What if Sally sees me?

1046
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:07,272
And besides our agreement was

1047
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:10,573
that I would spend the night
with you, not somebody else.

1048
00:51:10,573 --> 00:51:11,993
- I'll be there, Jed.

1049
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:15,251
And our agreement doesn't
prohibit the company of others.

1050
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:18,531
He wants you to invite your wife.

1051
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:20,364
She's really very hot.

1052
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,079
I know I'd like it.

1053
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,246
- You can forget about it.

1054
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,936
- I'm ready, let's go.

1055
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,113
- Stop pretending you don't like it.

1056
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:38,613
(sultry electronic music)

1057
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:31,559
Wait, her.

1058
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,450
- Her?
- Yeah, her.

1059
00:52:40,018 --> 00:52:41,880
(slot machine chiming)

1060
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,395
- OK, so, so what do you wanna do?

1061
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:44,813
You gonna walk up to her and say ,

1062
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:47,933
"Hi, why don't you come
upstairs for a threesome?"

1063
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,260
That's not gonna work, Sherry.

1064
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,760
- Don't underestimate yourself, she's hot.

1065
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,039
Just do it.

1066
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,198
I'll be right over there,
if she agrees to it

1067
00:53:05,198 --> 00:53:06,546
I'll meet you up in my room. OK?

1068
00:53:06,546 --> 00:53:08,796
Just pretend I'm not there.

1069
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:14,437
(sultry pensive music)

1070
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:23,539
(slot machine chiming)

1071
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:58,878
(date chuckling)

1072
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:07,738
- There I was sitting on
the other side of the casino

1073
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:10,196
and I saw you sitting there and

1074
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:12,446
I thought, "What the hell?"

1075
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,088
You know you are a very beautiful room.

1076
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:17,921
- Thanks.

1077
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:21,347
Wow, this is a really nice room.

1078
00:54:21,347 --> 00:54:22,398
- Should I give you the tour?

1079
00:54:22,398 --> 00:54:23,231
- Sure.
- OK.

1080
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,727
We got the lovely spacious living room.

1081
00:54:25,727 --> 00:54:27,115
The baby grand piano, do you play?

1082
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:27,964
- No I don't.

1083
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:32,297
- The bar and the great
panoramic view of Las Vegas.

1084
00:54:33,626 --> 00:54:36,024
- Do you mind if I sit down here?

1085
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,676
- I don't own the seat.

1086
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:40,388
- Of course you don't.

1087
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:41,638
Seven and Seven please.

1088
00:54:41,638 --> 00:54:42,969
- [Bartender] Coming up.

1089
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:44,581
- The only reason I ask
is I don't wanna sit here

1090
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,664
If it's gonna bother you.

1091
00:54:47,776 --> 00:54:50,361
- It doesn't bother me.

1092
00:54:50,361 --> 00:54:52,820
- What happened, did you lose your shirt?

1093
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,237
- No, my husband.

1094
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:56,931
- Excuse me.

1095
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:57,764
- Nothing.

1096
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:00,849
- Can I buy you a drink?

1097
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:02,468
- [Date] This is really nice.

1098
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:05,428
- [Jed] I've got a great
view over there of the city.

1099
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:08,213
- [Date] Oh, this is a beautiful view.

1100
00:55:08,213 --> 00:55:09,380
- Yeah, it is.

1101
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:15,852
It's, there's the, The Strip over there.

1102
00:55:15,852 --> 00:55:16,979
Oh, we got the bed over here too

1103
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:20,979
if you would like to
bounce around a little bit.

1104
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:23,029
- Maybe later.

1105
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:26,112
(smooth jazzy music)

1106
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:32,015

- So I seem to recall you

1121
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:50,946
saying something earlier about a husband.

1122
00:56:50,946 --> 00:56:52,245
- Did I?

1123
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:53,412
- Yes you did.

1124
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:56,548
Are you married?

1125
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:58,881
- Yeah, but I wish I wasn't.

1126
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,700
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

1127
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,122
We can talk about something else.

1128
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:05,622
So what do you do?

1129
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:10,957
- I'm one in a million outta
work actresses in Los Angeles.

1130
00:57:10,957 --> 00:57:11,790
- Yeah.

1131
00:57:12,768 --> 00:57:15,375
I think it's gonna happen
for you sooner or later.

1132
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,060
You strike me as a winner.

1133
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:17,893
- Thanks.

1134
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:19,790
I guess it doesn't mean much

1135
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:23,009
since you've only known me
for half an hour, but thanks.

1136
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:24,639
- No, it means a lot.

1137
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:27,140
I know people, that's my job.

1138
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,649
- What did you say you do again?

1139
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:30,301
- I'm a filmmaker.

1140
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:31,828
Not your kind of films though.

1141
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:34,287
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

1142
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:37,375
- So you shoot elephants in
the wild, stuff like that?

1143
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,749
- No, no, no, I only shoot people.

1144
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,520
They're what interests me.

1145
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,075
I study interesting people.

1146
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:48,057
And that's why I came
up and talked to you.

1147
00:57:48,057 --> 00:57:49,727
I've just about had it.

1148
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,462
I won me $300 tonight.

1149
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:53,945
So I'm want to go back up to my suite.

1150
00:57:53,945 --> 00:57:55,580
If you'd like to join me for a nightcap

1151
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,433
you're more than welcome.

1152
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,016
- I don't think so.

1153
00:58:00,861 --> 00:58:02,785
- OK, here's my card.

1154
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:04,402
It has my number on it.

1155
00:58:04,402 --> 00:58:06,402
Give me a call sometime.

1156
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,653
Give me a call sometime.

1157
00:58:16,653 --> 00:58:21,653
- You know, I think maybe I
will have that drink after all.

1158
00:58:21,683 --> 00:58:23,782
You really make me feel special.

1159
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:25,282
- You are special.

1160
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:27,415
Shall we go?

1161
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,248
- OK.

1162
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:35,726
(jazzy electronic music)

1163
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:45,234
- OK, Laura, you can go now.

1164
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,769
- That's it, that's all I have to do?

1165
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:49,686
- Yeah, you were great.

1166
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,153
- Whoa.

1167
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,521
Do you two know each other?

1168
00:58:57,521 --> 00:59:01,636
- Yes, she was paid to be
here, much like you were.

1169
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:03,969
I must admit it was amazing.

1170
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:06,271
- [Laura] I'll see you Sherry.

1171
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:08,661
Anytime you need me, I'm available.

1172
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:10,645
And it was nice meeting you.

1173
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:11,478
- Yeah.

1174
00:59:19,465 --> 00:59:20,965
Why'd you do that?

1175
00:59:22,154 --> 00:59:25,396
Did you think I'd be able to
pick up a woman on my own?

1176
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,367
- I just wanted insurance

1177
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:29,284
that my fantasy would be fulfilled.

1178
00:59:32,295 --> 00:59:34,751
Jed, I have some things
that I have to tell you.

1179
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,584
- What.

1180
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:39,193
- I lied to you about Stan.

1181
00:59:39,193 --> 00:59:41,183
(pensive music)

1182
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,633
- About what?

1183
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:46,268
- He never said you owed
him many more money.

1184
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:47,243
I made that up.

1185
00:59:47,243 --> 00:59:48,406
- Why?

1186
00:59:48,406 --> 00:59:51,562
- When I want something, I make it happen.

1187
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:52,993
Like with you.

1188
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:56,608
I wanted you, so I made it happen.

1189
00:59:56,608 --> 00:59:58,754
I wanted you for another night

1190
00:59:58,754 --> 01:00:00,921
and then I made it happen.

1191
01:00:02,194 --> 01:00:04,223
And Chick is dead.

1192
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,053
- Chick is dead?

1193
01:00:06,053 --> 01:00:08,886
- He didn't pay your debt on time.

1194
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:14,774
- You're,

1195
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:20,338
you're telling me that you
created this whole thing

1196
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:22,799
for your own amusement?

1197
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:23,632
- Yeah.

1198
01:00:24,759 --> 01:00:26,427
Wasn't it fun?

1199
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:29,844
You know, the thing is, I want you again.

1200
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:32,495
Huh?

1201
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,463
- Get off me.
- Jed.

1202
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:36,546
- Get off me.

1203
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:41,361
And I want my money, I want it now.

1204
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:43,559
- It's in the drawer.

1205
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:45,453
But you know what, Jed?

1206
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:48,203
You can't resist me, you want me?

1207
01:00:49,202 --> 01:00:50,931
I just want you inside of me, come on.

1208
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:54,502
- I want my money and I want it now.

1209
01:00:54,502 --> 01:00:56,263
- You can have your
money, it's right here.

1210
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:57,596
- Get it for me!

1211
01:00:58,708 --> 01:00:59,589
Get it.

1212
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,138
You can have it anytime you want.

1213
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:02,835
(Sherry giggling)

1214
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:04,913
Be rough with me, Jed, be rough.

1215
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:06,277
- You'd like that?
- Yes, I do.

1216
01:01:06,277 --> 01:01:07,585
- You like that?
- You can have it.

1217
01:01:07,585 --> 01:01:09,646
You can have your money,
yes, you can have it.

1218
01:01:09,646 --> 01:01:10,479
- You want it?

1219
01:01:10,479 --> 01:01:11,754
- Oh god, just do it rough.

1220
01:01:11,754 --> 01:01:13,024
- You want it?

1221
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:14,449
(Sherry exclaiming)
- I do.

1222
01:01:14,449 --> 01:01:16,450
- Yeah?
- You know what?

1223
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,016
(Sherry gasping)

1224
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,378
Let me tell you something.

1225
01:01:19,378 --> 01:01:20,958
This is all for my entertainment

1226
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,688
because I don't like to be bored, Jed.

1227
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:23,950
- Shut your mouth.

1228
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:24,783
Shut up.

1229
01:01:24,783 --> 01:01:26,139
(jazzy electronic music)

1230
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:28,972
(Sally chuckling)

1231
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,759
- Why you being so nice?

1232
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:36,514
- Oh, I guess I'm just a nice guy.

1233
01:01:36,514 --> 01:01:39,069
(Sally giggling)

1234
01:01:39,069 --> 01:01:41,614
- Really, I have no ulterior motives.

1235
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,567
Otherwise, I would've
made a pass at you by now.

1236
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,335
- That's not what I meant.

1237
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,502
I can tell you're a perfect gentleman.

1238
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,216
- So tell me about this husband.

1239
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:58,197
He seems like a real mystery man.

1240
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,247
- Lately, he is.

1241
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:03,119
We got ourselves into a
bit of trouble recently.

1242
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,857
- What kind of trouble?

1243
01:02:04,857 --> 01:02:07,357
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1244
01:02:09,357 --> 01:02:13,546
You know, sitting here
talking with you, John,

1245
01:02:13,546 --> 01:02:16,606
I'm beginning to remember
what it's like to just relax

1246
01:02:16,606 --> 01:02:19,370
and have a pleasant
conversation with someone.

1247
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:22,037
(pensive music)

1248
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:26,880

(pensive music)

1268
01:03:18,072 --> 01:03:21,989
(Sherry moaning and chuckling)

1269
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,561
- What, what are you doing here?

1270
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:28,128
You're supposed to be out.

1271
01:03:28,128 --> 01:03:29,740
- So Sally, it's not what it looks like.

1272
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,907
I can explain.

1273
01:03:33,735 --> 01:03:35,068
Hi, Sally, wait!

1274
01:03:36,255 --> 01:03:37,944
Sally, wait!

1275
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:39,533
Sally!

1276
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:40,424
(Sherry laughing)

1277
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:41,773
Wait up.

1278
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:44,991
(Sherry laughing)

1279
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:45,824
Sally wait.

1280
01:03:45,824 --> 01:03:46,791
- No, get away from me.

1281
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:47,975
- Sally, would you wait?
- No!

1282
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:50,543
- Goddammit, wait!
- Let go of me!

1283
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:51,615
- You're gonna wake everybody up.

1284
01:03:51,615 --> 01:03:53,358
- I don't care, you have picked, Jed.

1285
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:55,243
Let's go of me!
- Let explain what's going on.

1286
01:03:55,243 --> 01:03:57,536
- What possible explanation
could you have for that?

1287
01:03:57,536 --> 01:04:00,544
(Sherry chuckling)

1288
01:04:00,544 --> 01:04:01,815
- I saw an opportunity

1289
01:04:01,815 --> 01:04:05,304
and I took it to get us
out this god damn mess.

1290
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:06,137
OK?

1291
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:10,239
Now what the hell are
you doing in here anyway?

1292
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,201
- I got a note telling me to come.

1293
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:16,058
- Oh, that's, god damn bitch.

1294
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:18,505
- It's not what this is about, Jed.

1295
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:20,482
What scares me is it
if I hadn't found out,

1296
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,007
you never would've told me.

1297
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:25,340
You had no intention of ever telling me.

1298
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:28,822
I can forgive you for cheating on me, Jed,

1299
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:31,760
but I can't forgive you for lying to me.

1300
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,975
I can't trust you, so what-
- Sally, I'm sorry.

1301
01:04:33,975 --> 01:04:35,392
I'm sorry, Sally.

1302
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:37,332
OK, like I'm sorry.

1303
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:38,165
- I'm going back to LA.

1304
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,776
- No, where are you gonna go?

1305
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,634
Where you gonna go?
- Go back to Florida.

1306
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:42,467
Don't, Sally!

1307
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:44,999
- Get away from me!
- Sally!

1308
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:45,832
Ah, Sally!

1309
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,717
(pensive music)

1310
01:04:54,569 --> 01:04:57,840
(Jed grunting)

1311
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,673
Oh man.

1312
01:04:58,673 --> 01:05:00,429
- Were you able to patch things up?

1313
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,619
- What do you think?

1314
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,819
- I just wanted to see
how far I could take it.

1315
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:06,507
How about now?

1316
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:08,805
Would you consider getting in bed

1317
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:10,434
and making mad, passionate love?

1318
01:05:10,434 --> 01:05:13,504
- Right now I wouldn't
even spit in your face.

1319
01:05:13,504 --> 01:05:17,922
- Well, I guess I've taken
it to the outer limits.

1320
01:05:17,922 --> 01:05:21,203
You did more for money
than I thought you would.

1321
01:05:21,203 --> 01:05:23,953
You know, I suppose when
you have a lot of money,

1322
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:27,693
well you just forget how
desperate those without can be.

1323
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:31,276
- Yeah, well, what I
did I did for my life.

1324
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:36,018
That guy Stan might have
killed my wife and I.

1325
01:05:36,018 --> 01:05:39,268
- That's true, he very well might have.

1326
01:05:40,366 --> 01:05:42,217
That's only why you
agreed in the beginning.

1327
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:47,006
I know men and I know that
when you were with me,

1328
01:05:47,006 --> 01:05:48,412
you enjoyed it.

1329
01:05:48,412 --> 01:05:51,206
I'd even bet that you were turned on

1330
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:54,148
by the fact that you
were being paid for it.

1331
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:55,815
- Yeah, maybe I was.

1332
01:05:57,046 --> 01:06:02,046
But still, you didn't have to
be so cruel to my wife, Sally.

1333
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:04,345
- Look at it this way.

1334
01:06:04,345 --> 01:06:07,905
That's $20,000 more than
you thought you'd have.

1335
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:09,209
I could even take it one step further.

1336
01:06:09,209 --> 01:06:13,978
Maybe I'll just call Stan and
he'll squelch the whole bet.

1337
01:06:13,978 --> 01:06:17,067
That'll be $50,000 all to yourself.

1338
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:19,100
- No, forget about that, OK.

1339
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,683
I'll tell you what,

1340
01:06:21,661 --> 01:06:24,779
I don't need any more favors from you.

1341
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:28,862
I'll just take my $50,000
and I'll pay off my bet

1342
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:33,407
and then I'm gonna go back
and buy back something

1343
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,460
that I had to sell.

1344
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,293
OK?

1345
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:42,139
I'll tell you what, gimme
my money and I'm outta here.

1346
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,569
- Good luck.

1347
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:54,342
(doorbell buzzing)

1348
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,049
- Sally, what's wrong?

1349
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:07,914
- I need a ride back to LA.

1350
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:09,547
Do you think you can gimme one?

1351
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:10,921
- Of course.

1352
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:15,338
Why don't you come in to
get a few hours sleep First.

1353
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:19,720
I am very attracted to you, but.

1354
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,637
Whoa, careful, careful.

1355
01:07:22,491 --> 01:07:23,766
I don't wanna do this

1356
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:25,954
if it's gonna be something
you end up regretting.

1357
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:28,420
- John, I won't regret it.

1358
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,087
(reels booming)

1359
01:07:31,945 --> 01:07:33,825
(slot machines chiming)

1360
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:37,242
(jazzy electronic music)

1361
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:45,011
(Sally sighing)

1362
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:56,915
- [Sally] Yeah.

1363
01:08:14,854 --> 01:08:18,521
(Sally moaning and panting)

1364
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:33,773
(pensive music)

1365
01:08:41,949 --> 01:08:43,246
- Hey, I know it's been
more than two days,

1366
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:45,217
but do you still have
the rings I left here?

1367
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:46,050
- Yes I do.

1368
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,592
- Oh, great.

1369
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:49,158
I'd like to buy 'em back.

1370
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:52,991
- However, I did have
an offer on those rings.

1371
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,478
It's gonna cost you
$10,000 to get them back.

1372
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:57,607
- How much?

1373
01:08:57,607 --> 01:08:58,440
- 10,000.

1374
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,690
- 10,000 dol...

1375
01:09:01,038 --> 01:09:02,871
- Take it or leave it.

1376
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:06,042
- What?

1377
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:10,902
Bastard.

1378
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:15,362
- Sally.

1379
01:09:16,747 --> 01:09:17,580
Sally.

1380
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:21,171
Sally, you here?

1381
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:24,130
Sally.

1382
01:09:26,758 --> 01:09:28,172
Sally.

1383
01:09:28,172 --> 01:09:29,172
Where the...

1384
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:33,177
Shit.

1385
01:09:42,863 --> 01:09:44,155
Sally!

1386
01:09:44,155 --> 01:09:44,988
Wait!

1387
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:47,644
Where the hell you going?

1388
01:09:47,644 --> 01:09:48,974
- I told you where I was going, Jed.

1389
01:09:48,974 --> 01:09:50,177
Leave me alone.

1390
01:09:50,177 --> 01:09:51,105
- Who the hell's this guy.

1391
01:09:51,105 --> 01:09:53,647
- It's John, my ride.

1392
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,561
- Look, you're going back
to Los Angeles, Sally,

1393
01:09:56,561 --> 01:09:57,805
I'll give you a ride, OK?

1394
01:09:57,805 --> 01:09:59,786
- I don't want you to gimme a ride, Jed,

1395
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:02,080
I want you to leave me alone.

1396
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,821
Sounds like you found
your calling in life.

1397
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:05,145
- Oh, don't be like that.

1398
01:10:05,145 --> 01:10:07,945
- Jed, I loved you so much.

1399
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:10,003
I would've have done anything for you.

1400
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:11,714
But that's it, it's over.

1401
01:10:11,714 --> 01:10:13,386
I don't want you in my life anymore.

1402
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:14,566
- I got the rings back, look.

1403
01:10:14,566 --> 01:10:15,435
- I don't want it.

1404
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:16,518
Stop it, Jed.

1405
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:20,249
- Sally, I said I was sorry, OK?

1406
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,014
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

1407
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:23,695
John, let's go.

1408
01:10:23,695 --> 01:10:25,094
- Excuse me.

1409
01:10:25,094 --> 01:10:27,484
Hey, I think the lady's made
her feelings clear, don't you?

1410
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:28,816
- No.
- Yeah, I think she has.

1411
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:30,899
- [Jed] I don't think so.

1412
01:11:06,268 --> 01:11:07,658
- Hey.
- Whoa, hey, hey.

1413
01:11:07,658 --> 01:11:08,491
Take it easy, man.

1414
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:10,315
I got your fuckin' money, all right.

1415
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:11,232
Here, here.

1416
01:11:12,914 --> 01:11:16,471
Don't touch me, here's your 10,000 here.

1417
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:19,561
Here, $30,000 , we're square.

1418
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:20,609
- Thanks.

1419
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:24,442
But you don't owe it to
me, you owe it to her.

1420
01:11:25,926 --> 01:11:26,926
- To Sherry?

1421
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:31,520
- [Sherry] Jed, you don't look so good.

1422
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,539
- Yeah, well my wife just left me.

1423
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:35,781
Thank you.
- Well,

1424
01:11:35,781 --> 01:11:37,346
maybe it's for the best.

1425
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:39,547
- What's this guy talking about?

1426
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:42,499
- What, I didn't hear what he said.

1427
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:45,550
- He says I don't owe him the
money, I owe the money to you.

1428
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,383
- Oh that,

1429
01:11:46,383 --> 01:11:48,988
that was just one little thing
that I neglected to tell you

1430
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:52,369
in my revelation to you last night.

1431
01:11:52,369 --> 01:11:54,199
Stan works for me.

1432
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:56,159
I'm the one taking the bets.

1433
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,268
Stan's just a collector.

1434
01:11:58,268 --> 01:11:59,284
- And what about the
other night in your room

1435
01:11:59,284 --> 01:12:01,683
when he was pounding on the goddamn door?

1436
01:12:01,683 --> 01:12:03,636
- I guess I'm a fairly decent actress.

1437
01:12:03,636 --> 01:12:05,267
(both laughing)

1438
01:12:05,267 --> 01:12:06,896
It's all a game.

1439
01:12:06,896 --> 01:12:10,553
High stakes bluff, I
guess you got bluffed.

1440
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:13,310
- So you're telling me this
whole thing was a a setup.

1441
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:15,290
You, you made this whole thing up.

1442
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:18,942
- Yes, it was, all
constructed from my amusement.

1443
01:12:18,942 --> 01:12:19,961
Life is boring, Jed.

1444
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:22,151
And I just hate to be bored.

1445
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:26,318
- Excuse me, but I'll meet
you back at the office.

1446
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:35,250
- [Sherry] So would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

1447
01:12:37,022 --> 01:12:39,406
- Yeah, sure, why not?

1448
01:12:39,406 --> 01:12:40,239
- You mean to tell me

1449
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,105
that you'd spend the
night with me for free?

1450
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:47,188
- Yeah, well, I don't have
anything else to lose?

1451
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:51,101
- You know what, I'm really
not interested anymore.

1452
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:53,890
I thought it was fun when
you weren't interested in me.

1453
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:57,557
But now that you are,
you seem so desperate.

1454
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:02,216
- You know you are such a bitch.

1455
01:13:05,252 --> 01:13:09,348
- You see that couple
on the roulette wheel?

1456
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:10,181
- Yeah.

1457
01:13:11,072 --> 01:13:13,842
- They've been losing
an awful lot of money.

1458
01:13:13,842 --> 01:13:15,175
- Yeah, so what?

1459
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:18,278
- He is really quite attractive.

1460
01:13:18,278 --> 01:13:21,072
I wonder how bad it's gonna get for them.

1461
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:22,822
Hmm, they lost again.

1462
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:25,801
Too bad.

1463
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:29,958
(pensive music)

1464
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:49,867
- Hey Mister, you got a buck?

1465
01:13:51,643 --> 01:13:53,476
- How about a hundred?

1466
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:58,013
- A hundred, you must be a millionaire.

1467
01:13:58,013 --> 01:14:00,132
- No, just a writer.

1468
01:14:00,132 --> 01:14:02,351
Got a great idea for a screenplay.

1469
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:03,581
- All right, thanks a lot, man.

1470
01:14:03,581 --> 01:14:04,748
- No problemo.

1471
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:06,708
- Excuse me.

1472
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,794
- Sure, here, I'll get
that for you, Elvis.

1473
01:14:08,794 --> 01:14:10,709
- Thank you, thank you very much.

1474
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:11,542
- My pleasure.

1475
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:14,959
(jazzy electronic music)

1476
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:22,304
Yeah!

1477
01:14:52,217 --> 01:14:54,884
(pensive music)

1478
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:19,738
(sultry electronic music)

1479
01:16:47,518 --> 01:16:50,185
(pensive music)

1480
01:17:29,494 --> 01:17:32,994
(jazzy electronic music)
