1
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,319
Good God.

2
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,196
Matthew.

3
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,799
Matthew.

4
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,749
Matthew.

5
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,630
They say your whole life flashes before
your eyes when you die.

6
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,192
And it's true, even for a blind man.

7
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,758
l grew up in Hell's Kitchen.

8
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,515
The politicians and the real-estate
developers call it Clinton now.

9
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,073
But a neighborhood,
like everything else, has a soul.

10
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,708
And souls don 't change with a name.

11
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,440
Come on, hit me.
l'll give you a free shot.

12
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,319
-Hit him again.
-You fight like your dad.

13
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,509
Come on, hit me.

14
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,750
-My dad's gonna be champ.
-Your dad's a bum.

15
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,349
-Yeah, a bum.
-Come on. Hit me.

16
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,151
-Yeah, he's a punk, man.
-Can't fight.

17
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,039
-Sure can run though.
-Pathetic.

18
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,870
My father was a boxer.

19
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,838
A sportswriter once wrote
that he fought like the devil...

20
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,752
...and the name stuck.

21
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,992
Jack "The Devil" Murdock
was a contender.

22
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,113
But that was a long time ago.

23
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,876
Come on, Dad. Get up.

24
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,550
-Who won?
-Colan.

25
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,631
Yeah?

26
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,032
-l beat him, you know.
-l know, Dad. TKO.

27
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,990
And l beat Sharpman,
Robbers, Wagner.

28
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,996
-Hey, hey, what's that?
-Nothing.

29
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,832
l told you l didn't want you fighting.

30
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,879
They said that you work for Fallon.
That you're one of his guys now.

31
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,436
Get over here. Sit down. Come on.

32
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,552
Think l'd be pulling double overtime at
the docks if l was working for Fallon?

33
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,029
What are you, nuts?

34
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,113
You don't hit nothing but books.
Get me?

35
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,876
You be a doctor or a lawyer.
Not like me.

36
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,790
-Dad. . . .
-Matt, you can do it.

37
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,838
You can do anything
if you're not afraid.

38
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,468
Now, you promise me.

39
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,149
l promise, Dad.

40
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,828
One day, l took a shortcut
home from school.

41
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,437
What l saw, l'll never forget...

42
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,793
...because it would be the last thing
l'd ever see.

43
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,190
-Jack, l don't want you to hurt me.
-l will.

44
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,794
Jack, come on.
l had other obligations.

45
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,673
-Dad?
-Okay, l got it.

46
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,350
Matt?

47
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,995
Matt!

48
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,034
l'm sorry, Matty.

49
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,156
l'm so sorry.

50
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,919
lt's okay, Dad. lt's okay.

51
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,829
We made each other a silent promise...

52
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,594
... to never give up.

53
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,271
To be fearless.

54
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,708
To stick up for the long shots like us.

55
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,789
We were two fighters
on the comeback trail.

56
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,955
l had lost my sight,
but l got something back in return.

57
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,518
My remaining four senses functioned
with superhuman sharpness.

58
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,998
But most amazing of all, my sense of
sound gave off a kind of radar sense.

59
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,634
High above the roar of the streets,
l trained my body and my senses.

60
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,675
An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...

61
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,319
...until the city itself
became my playground.

62
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,797
l was the boy without fear.

63
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,031
Murdock!

64
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,993
Hey, Murdock! Round two.

65
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,268
-What's up, freak?
-Look at him, man. Look at his eyes.

66
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,755
-Kick his ass.
-Go ahead, fight me. l dare you.

67
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,309
-Yeah, Murdock.
-l dare you.

68
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,074
Yeah, that's what l'm saying, man.
Kick his ass.

69
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,473
Come on, man, let's just go.

70
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,678
Okay.

71
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,238
Jack, it's been a while.

72
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,195
-l don't work for you no more, Fallon.
-Jack, you never stopped.

73
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,148
Did you really think
you won those fights on your own?

74
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,914
You're 42 years old.
Miller, Mack, Bendis.

75
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,078
They're all my fighters.

76
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,799
Just like you.

77
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,872
And now it's your turn to take a fall.

78
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,237
Think about your boy, Jack.

79
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,151
l'm sure you'll do the right thing.

80
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,353
No, come on, Dad! Come on, Dad,
get up! You can do it, Dad. Come on!

81
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,508
Come on, Dad. Get up! Come on!

82
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,355
Let's go! Come on! Come on, Dad!
Get up!

83
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,835
Never give up.

84
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,560
Yeah, yeah! Come on, Dad. All right!
Yeah!

85
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,078
You all right? Murdock, you all right?
Okay, let's fight.

86
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,558
Down! He's out. Fight's over.

87
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,391
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner, by way of knockout. . .

88
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,680
. . .Jack "The Devil" Murdock!

89
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,473
This one was for you, Matty.

90
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,197
l waited outside of the Olympic
for my father.

91
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,272
ln some ways, l'm still waiting.

92
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,275
Finish him off.

93
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,878
Dad!

94
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,954
l can't see you, Dad.

95
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,915
l can't see you.

96
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,633
No one cared much about the death
of a washed-up prizefighter.

97
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,873
Nobody but me.
l would keep my promise.

98
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,554
l would help those
that others wouldn 't.

99
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,188
l would seek justice.

100
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,114
One way or another.

101
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,832
Ladies and gentlemen,
justice is blind. . .

102
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,877
. . .but it can be heard.
And today, the truth will come out.

103
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,873
Mr. Quesada,
would you state for the court. . .

104
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,237
. . .the sequence of events leading up
to the night of June 30?

105
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,389
l stopped off at Josie's Bar after work.
l had a few drinks.

106
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,236
Angela was there.
She was closing up.

107
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,713
She asked me if l wanted
to stick around for some fun.

108
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,438
Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.

109
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,113
Are you aware that perjury is a crime,
Mr. Quesada?

110
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,953
Objection. My client's a respectable
member of the community.

111
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,157
-Miss Sutton has a history of drug--
-My client's not on trial.

112
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,669
-Her testimony is suspect--
-Nor is her testimony suspect.

113
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,154
Gentlemen, that's enough.

114
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,269
The truth is, Mr. Murdock,
is that Miss Sutton. . . .

115
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,271
Miss Sutton enjoyed every minute
of it.

116
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,354
Mr. Quesada, for your sake,
l hope justice is found here today. . .

117
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,276
. . .before justice finds you.

118
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,840
That's not right.
Another rapist back on the streets.

119
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,513
Yeah? Here's what l don't get.

120
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,877
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsh?

121
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,749
He can't.
The Kingpin's gotta be footing the bill.

122
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,671
-Come on. Let's go get drunk.
-Not tonight.

123
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,229
l got work to do.

124
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,996
-Right here.
-Hey.

125
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,038
-What's up?
-You gotta take that.

126
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,872
-Big neck, come on.
-l can't believe--

127
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,031
What was her name?

128
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,158
To the justice system, right?
Of course l beat it.

129
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,392
Kingpin's got my back, bro.
How you doing, sweetie?

130
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,073
-Boss?
-What's up?

131
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,756
-What's up with that?
-ls that guy for real?

132
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,229
Yeah, he's for real.

133
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,954
-What do you want?
-Justice.

134
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,756
Oh, God. Oh, God!

135
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,270
-Hi. How you doing?
-Didn't you hear?

136
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,874
-l was acquitted.
-Not by me.

137
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,837
Hey, that light
at the end of the tunnel?

138
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,431
-Guess what. That's not heaven.
-l'll kill you! l'll kill you!

139
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,950
-That's the C train.
-l'll kill you! Oh, God!

140
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,156
Hey, you can't go past there.

141
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,436
-Call Charlie.
-Right.

142
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,149
You're wasting your time, Urich.
There's nothing to see here.

143
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,834
Jose Quesada.

144
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,548
And the rest of Jose Quesada.

145
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,473
-Whole lot of nothing, huh?
-Keep running those stories. . .

146
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,189
. . .and we'll end up with copycat
vigilantes who'll get themselves killed.

147
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,313
Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this, detective?

148
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,790
Come on, Urich. Stop busting my--

149
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,758
There is no proof that your
so-called Daredevil was involved. . .

150
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,515
. . .nor that he even exists. Got it?

151
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,909
Got it.

152
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,868
Can one man make a difference?

153
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,831
There are days when l believe.
And others when l have lost all faith.

154
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,636
Matt, it's Heather. Are you there?
Of course you're not there.

155
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,554
You're never there.
At least not for me.

156
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,678
Look, l didn 't want to do this
over the phone...

157
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,990
...but it's not like you've given me
any choice.

158
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,877
lt's been three months now, and
l've never even seen your apartment.

159
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,112
Every time we sleep together,
l wake up in the morning alone.

160
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,159
l mean, Jesus, where do you go
at 3:00 in the morning?

161
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,873
l thought that if l waited, if
l was patient enough, you'd let me in.

162
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,718
That we'd take our relationship
to the next level.

163
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,668
Then l realized
that this is the next level.

164
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,277
Goodbye, Matt.
l hope you find what you're looking for.

165
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,916
Forgive me, Father, for l have sinned.

166
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,793
-lt's been a week since--
-What are you playing at, Matt?

167
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,190
You didn't come here for forgiveness.

168
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,669
You want permission,
and l can't give you that.

169
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,310
-Justice isn't a sin, Father.
-No, but vengeance is.

170
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,598
You see it every day on the streets.
Violence just begets more violence.

171
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,070
ls that how you want to live your life?
A lawyer during the day. . .

172
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,198
. . .and then judge and jury at night.
ls that what you want?

173
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,194
-Somebody has to do something.
-Well, why you?

174
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,191
-Because l can. Because l'm not afraid.
-Well, l'm afraid for you, Matthew.

175
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,830
Look, a man without fear
is a man without hope.

176
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,756
May God have mercy on you, forgive you
and grant you everlasting life. Amen.

177
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,310
l'm not too crazy
about the outfit either.

178
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,356
"Eyewitnesses say Quesada
was singled out. . .

179
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,229
. . .by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil. "

180
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,393
-l don't know why you read that.
-There's gotta be something to it.

181
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,831
-Like the alligators in the sewers?
-There are alligators in the sewers.

182
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,549
-A friend in sanitation has seen them.
-Fine. Just drop it.

183
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,115
You should see this guy.
They got this picture.

184
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,392
-They have a picture?
-lt's a drawing, an artist's rendering.

185
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,118
lt's just-- lt's grotesque.

186
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,993
l'd hate to see his therapy bills.
Speaking of bills. . .

187
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,310
. . .your client, Mr. Lee,
made his first payment.

188
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,190
-Great. You should be very happy.
-Yeah, it's fantastic. He paid in fluke.

189
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,159
Fluke is a fish.
Did you know that? l didn't.

190
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,993
Mr. Lee is a good man
and doesn't have much money. . .

191
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,549
. . .and he fishes on weekends.
l guess it's--

192
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,639
l salsa dance on weekends, but l don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.

193
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,597
Will you pass the honey, please?

194
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,159
We need better clients.
l'm tired of pro bono cases.

195
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,830
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.

196
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,230
What's your idea of better?
Define "better. "

197
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,515
-What would be a better client?
-Better means rich and guilty, okay?

198
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,029
Law school taught us
to create a moral vacuum. . .

199
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,668
. . .so you can represent people
who aren't innocent.

200
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,668
-That was your best course, as l recall.
-You don't have a moral vacuum.

201
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,757
You are completely vacuum-less.

202
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,798
-What? What? Where? Where? Where?
-Front door. Not yet, soon.

203
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,556
Now.

204
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,550
Tell me.

205
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,393
-You want the truth?
-Absolutely.

206
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,919
She's hideous.

207
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,390
l don't know if it's a fungus
or some congenital birth defect. . .

208
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,674
. . .but as your attorney in this matter,
l advise you to take no further action.

209
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,237
-l'm sorry. Excuse me.
-Sure.

210
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,713
l was looking for some honey.
Could you help me out?

211
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,631
Right in front of you.

212
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,437
Well, could you be
a little bit more specific?

213
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,638
-What are you--?
-Blind? Yeah.

214
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,073
-l am so sorry.
-That's okay.

215
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,350
-Friend of yours?
-You know, l've never seen him before.

216
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,551
Matt Murdock.

217
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,555
-Nice to meet you, Matt Murdock.
-Nice to meet you.

218
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,194
l didn't get your name.

219
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,558
l didn't give it.

220
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,548
Some people have no compassion
for the handicapped.

221
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,868
Apparently not.

222
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,548
-Where you going?
-l'm gonna file an appeal.

223
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,512
We have to be in court by noon.

224
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,473
-1 2:00, Matt.
-l'll be there.

225
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,833
What do you want?

226
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,313
l just wanted to get your name.
l didn't want trouble.

227
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,436
Look. . .

228
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,476
. . .l don't like being followed.
So don't.

229
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,473
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a second. Take it easy.

230
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,353
l don't like being touched.

231
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,632
Why don't you tell me what you do like,
and we'll start there.

232
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,512
Sure you're blind?

233
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,314
Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?

234
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,471
-You're holding back.
-Yes.

235
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,596
Don't.

236
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,991
Does every guy have to go through this
to find out your name?

237
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,276
Try asking for my number.

238
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,553
-Fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight!

239
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,959
Stop hitting me.

240
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,314
Okay.

241
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,838
My name's Elektra Natchios.

242
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,675
-What's wrong, Wesley?
-Have you seen the papers today?

243
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,400
Somebody's been talking.

244
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,472
Somebody always does.

245
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,033
Natchios, my dear, old friend.

246
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,319
l'm getting out, Wilson.

247
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,035
l am out.

248
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,671
You think it's funny?
They're writing about the Kingpin.

249
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,871
They're going back to the beginning.

250
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,237
Well, l'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

251
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,316
l want to put that behind me.
l want you to buy me out.

252
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,189
l think you'll find
it's a very generous offer.

253
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,796
So, what do you say?

254
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,273
How's your daughter?

255
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,874
-You okay?
-l. . . . l think l'll be okay.

256
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,110
l'm not gonna lie
and say it doesn't hurt.

257
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,869
-Where did you learn to fight like that?
-My father.

258
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,589
He had me study with a different sensei
every year since l was 5.

259
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,315
Sounds like he wanted to turn you
into some kind of a warrior.

260
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,834
No. Just not a victim.

261
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,078
-Watch your step.
-Thank you. l didn't even--

262
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,838
Wait.

263
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,514
How did you do that?
How did you do the park?

264
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,877
l don't know,
growing up in the Kitchen, a blind kid.

265
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,754
You learn how to look out for yourself.

266
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,992
See that? He just ran that light.

267
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,998
l want you to create a paper trail,
one that can be traced to Natchios.

268
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,431
-Sir?
-The press want a kingpin.

269
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,479
So l'll give them a kingpin.
Get me Bullseye.

270
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,029
Two out of three.

271
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,917
Bloody lrish piece of trash.

272
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,590
-l said l was sorry. What do you want?
-Details. You owe me that.

273
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,992
Her name's Elektra Natchios.

274
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,469
She sounds like a Mexican appetizer.

275
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,517
lt's Greek, genius.

276
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,274
Her father's Nikolaos Natchios.

277
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,271
-The billionaire?
-Yeah, see. Yes, the billionaire.

278
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,352
As your attorney, l advise you
to marry her immediately.

279
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,431
l'll take it under consideration.

280
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,118
Susie is my son Larry's daughter
by his first marriage.

281
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,751
She eloped with this
semi-colored fellow from London.

282
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,797
What's the word for that? Mulatto.

283
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,713
Just let's say he had
a little cream in his coffee.

284
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,997
But he did very well
for himself on the lnternet.

285
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,991
But don't ask me how. No.

286
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,835
You know, they did get me a computer
for Christmas last year. . .

287
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,310
. . .but l refuse. l'm afraid
it's going to explode.

288
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,630
But who can afford to fly these days?

289
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,432
But then my sister Marjorie called and
said she had these frequent-flier miles. . .

290
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,876
. . .and she couldn't use them
because of her sciatic nerve.

291
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,439
So l said--

292
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,918
She's sleeping. Can l get you
anything before we land?

293
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,756
More peanuts, please.

294
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,433
-Yo, taxi!
-That's over on Seventh.

295
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,996
-You don't remember me?
-Thanks, buddy.

296
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,230
How can you not remember
the Kingpin?

297
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,116
No, no, no, no. Please!

298
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,149
No, please, no!

299
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,634
You remember me now?

300
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,112
What are you, stupid? You think you
could hold out on the Kingpin? Huh?

301
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,275
Get away from me!

302
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,196
Stay out of Hell's Kitchen.

303
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,669
This ain't your neighborhood no more.

304
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,990
Kitchen belongs to the Kingpin now.

305
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,038
Please.

306
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,760
Please don't hurt me.

307
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,832
l'm not the bad guy, kid.

308
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,669
l'm not the bad guy.

309
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,711
l'm not.

310
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,353
l have to call you back
because he just came in.

311
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,839
Morning.

312
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,075
-Your ears must have been burning.
-Why?

313
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,674
This just came by messenger.

314
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,559
Your invitation to the
Black & White Ball at The Grand.

315
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,835
Plus one.

316
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,958
Plus one? All right.

317
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,156
Guess l gotta rent a tux.

318
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,517
Wow. They spent some
serious money on this invitation.

319
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,069
l mean, you should feel it.
lt's engraved.

320
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,198
-What time are you gonna pick me up?
-l'm not going.

321
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,351
What? Are you crazy?

322
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,318
That place is gonna be
crawling with rich people.

323
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,233
People who pay legal fees
with money, not with fish.

324
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,313
Or with wheels of cheese.
Or with sports supplies.

325
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,519
l'm gonna fill you in on a secret.
This place doesn't look like a law office.

326
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,958
lt looks like the set of Sanford and Son.
l'm waiting for Lamont to walk in.

327
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,754
-Then you go.
-Look at me, Matt. l'm a plus-one.

328
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,959
Plus-ones don't get anywhere alone.
They need somebody to bring them.

329
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,237
Are you finished? We only
have an hour to prepare for court.

330
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,356
What's eating you?

331
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,312
Rough night.

332
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,674
Well, you want to talk about it?

333
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,994
No.

334
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,270
-lt's about Elektra, isn't it?
-No.

335
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,116
Natchios owns The Grand Hotel, and
Elektra's the reason you were invited.

336
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,997
She's out of my league,
and l'd rather end it before it starts.

337
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,598
That's gotta be some record. You just
completely bypass the relationship. . .

338
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,957
. . .you went right into the breakup.
Trying to save some time?

339
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,510
What happens to that lie detector
of yours when it detects your own bull?

340
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,830
Let's really bury the needle, huh?

341
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,237
Swish.

342
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,032
Look, Matt, seriously,
the ball's in your court.

343
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,199
So does this mean you want a rematch?

344
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,196
l knew l'd find you.

345
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,117
How did you know l wasn't a mugger?

346
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,355
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels.

347
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,590
At least this far from Chelsea.

348
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,710
Come here.

349
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,396
There's something l wanna show you.

350
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,034
Wait a second.

351
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,670
Exactly how many women
have you brought up here, anyway?

352
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,398
You're my first.

353
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,189
-Good answer.
-l thought that was the right answer.

354
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,757
Look at this.

355
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,150
lt's so beautiful.

356
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,108
l know. This was my favorite view
of the city when l was a kid.

357
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,555
l really wanted you to see this.

358
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,918
What's this?

359
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,590
That's from my mother.

360
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,877
-For good luck.
-lt's beautiful.

361
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,156
lt's a good-luck charm, huh?

362
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,790
l could use one of those.
Do they make them in Braille?

363
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,352
She gave it to me right before she died.

364
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,553
What happened?

365
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,909
-l should go.
-No. Just wait.

366
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,311
-No, l'm gonna go--
-Wait, wait, wait. lt's about to rain.

367
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,472
-No, it's not.
-lt is. l'm telling you, it's--

368
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,838
The temperature dropped two or
three degrees. l can smell the moisture.

369
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,949
And when it rains, it's like
there's a rooftop on the world.

370
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,912
Each raindrop makes a sound
the first time it falls on a surface.

371
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,638
Just then, it's like l. . . .

372
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,870
lt's like l can see again.

373
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,913
And l just wanna. . . .

374
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,156
l just wanna see you.

375
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,196
Okay.

376
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,597
Look, here it comes.

377
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,229
My God.

378
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,919
You are so beautiful.

379
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,997
Hey, l'm gonna cut you up, man.

380
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,631
-Think Kingpin didn't want his money?
-What?

381
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,873
-That's my car! That's my car!
-Matt, what's wrong?

382
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,352
-Police!
-Shut up!

383
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,388
-Matt?
-l'm sorry.

384
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,711
-l have to go.
-Hey, come back here.

385
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,960
Stay.

386
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,430
Stay with me.

387
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,988
This is what l'm talking about.
Aren't you happy you listened to me?

388
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,196
This is gonna be great for business.

389
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,874
Thank you.

390
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,710
Matt Murdock. Ben Urich,
New York Post.

391
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,152
Ben Urich, nice to meet you.

392
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,788
You write articles
about urban legends, right?

393
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,195
Well, yes, among other things.

394
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,911
Settle something for us. You know
the alligators in the sewers? My partner--

395
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,594
l followed that piece
you wrote about the Kingpin.

396
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,510
One man running all the crime in New
York City sounds a little far-fetched.

397
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,874
Yeah, but, then again, so does a vigilante
who thinks every day is Halloween.

398
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,833
They gotta be huge by now, right,
the alligators?

399
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,433
lt's a myth.

400
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,758
Look, l'd like you to give me a call--

401
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,112
Sorry.

402
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,310
Cool color.

403
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,708
l wouldn't know.

404
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,670
Yeah, but do give me a call. There's
something l'd like to talk to you about.

405
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,391
Nice to meet you. Enjoy the party.

406
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,036
Look at that.
Wilson Fisk is in the hizzey.

407
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,717
We may never get a chance
like this again. Come on, let's go.

408
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,310
-We should talk about this.
-Mr. Fisk. Hi.

409
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,040
lt's Franklin Nelson
from Nelson & Murdock--

410
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,590
Hey, yeah, you wanna talk to Mr. Fisk,
you make an appointment.

411
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,158
-Okay?
-Wesley. l know who you are.

412
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,675
You're the blind lawyers
from Hell's Kitchen.

413
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,468
Right. Actually, he's the blind one.

414
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,830
l'm deaf.

415
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,513
Give them a card, Wesley.

416
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,035
l'm always on the lookout
for new blood.

417
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,078
l'm sorry, Mr. Fisk.
My partner is a little overzealous.

418
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,435
We can't represent you.

419
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,559
And why is that?

420
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,552
Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?

421
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,993
Because we only handle
clients who are innocent.

422
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,319
"lnnocent," he said. He's pretty funny.

423
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,948
l've learned one thing
in my years in this business.

424
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,429
What's that?

425
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,114
Nobody's innocent.

426
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,430
Nobody.

427
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,115
-Have a great time at the party.
-Thank you.

428
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,114
l just-- You know, Matt,
for one night, l just wish. . . .

429
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,794
l just. . . .

430
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,193
Matt, l just wish l could
give you my eyes for one night.

431
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,719
-lt's like that?
-lt's like that.

432
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,440
You want me to take you
up there, Matt? Matt?

433
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,389
Matt?

434
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,790
Now l found you.

435
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,798
That's all that matters.

436
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,390
Hi. Hello. Hello.

437
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,196
Hello.

438
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,192
You look beautiful tonight.

439
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,398
Do you mind?

440
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,920
No, l just. . . . Sometimes it makes
people uncomfortable. That's all.

441
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,310
Not me.

442
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,910
But you should know. . .

443
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,311
. . .that the only reason
l got dressed up for this thing. . .

444
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,517
. . .was that l wanted
to look beautiful for you.

445
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,392
l wish you could see me tonight.

446
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,190
Me too.

447
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,119
Matt.

448
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,237
What's wrong?

449
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,311
lt's just. . .

450
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,795
. . .good things don't happen
to me very often.

451
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,030
When they do, l get scared.

452
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,355
Nothing bad is gonna happen. Promise.

453
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,029
Doesn't she look beautiful?

454
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,316
l think she's happy.

455
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,314
l haven't seen her smile like that
since before her mother was killed.

456
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,631
Poor girl. Right in front of her eyes.

457
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,711
What, you have to bring that up now?

458
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,316
History has a way of repeating itself.

459
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,190
-What are you saying?
-Just saying goodbye, old friend.

460
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,268
Just saying goodbye.

461
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,671
-Something's happening.
-What is it?

462
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,829
Papa!

463
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,913
Papa. Papa.

464
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,472
Tell me where you're going.

465
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,033
You wait.

466
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,116
l'm sorry.

467
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,038
-What is going on?
-New York is not a safe place tonight.

468
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,236
That's all you need to know.

469
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,434
Watch out!

470
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,672
l missed. l never miss.

471
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,998
Drop something?

472
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,194
Bullseye.

473
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,990
Daddy.

474
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,036
Get that over to Forensics right away.

475
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,428
Hey, Nick.

476
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,070
What do you want, Urich?
Does all this make you happy?

477
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,953
Looks like you got your story.

478
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,391
You were right, Father.

479
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,068
You were right.

480
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,917
-l know how you feel.
-You don't know how l feel.

481
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,875
l want revenge.

482
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,120
Revenge won't make the pain go away.
Trust me. l know.

483
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,919
There's no place for me now.

484
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,832
Yes, there is.

485
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,916
Stay.

486
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,911
Stay with me.

487
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,268
Please.

488
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,518
Elektra.

489
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,069
Elektra, wait.

490
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,833
Please.

491
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,192
Drive.

492
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,390
Oh, cha-ching.

493
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,669
This better be good, Kirby.

494
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,150
You know me, Urich.
lt's always good. Come on.

495
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,952
Okay.

496
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,271
Are you ready to see
something really, really cool?

497
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,435
-Come on.
-Okay.

498
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,673
-Come on. l'm throwing you gold.
-Give me my money.

499
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,478
-Why?
-l've seen it. Come on.

500
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,399
All right.
Well, but have you seen this?

501
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,275
And tighty righty, loosey left--

502
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,237
You said to look out
for anything weird, yes?

503
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,039
This is pretty weird shit
right here, man. Right?

504
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,432
You have no idea.

505
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,236
Police are still investigating the murder
of Nikolaos Natchios--

506
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,914
--will identify Natchios
as the so-called Kingpin.

507
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,038
--believes that the self-styled
vigilante is wanted for murder.

508
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,191
--implication of Daredevil.

509
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,788
How did you get past my security?

510
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,391
You mean that guy?

511
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,838
Was that really necessary?

512
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,753
Necessary? No, it was fun.

513
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,920
You know, you've exceeded
all my expectations.

514
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,869
You even managed to implicate Daredevil
in the process. You should be pleased.

515
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,112
He. . .

516
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,510
. . .made me. . .

517
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,033
. . .miss.

518
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,389
There's an old saying that
too much pride can kill a man.

519
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,715
The devil is mine.

520
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,393
Really?

521
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,192
l've heard that before, all too
many times. But answer me this:

522
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,716
How do you kill a man without fear?

523
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,153
By putting the fear in him.

524
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,831
l like that. But first. . .

525
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,753
. . .give Elektra all my best.

526
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,755
ls there anything else?

527
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,958
Yeah.

528
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,072
l want a bloody costume.

529
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,758
What do you want?

530
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,677
-Matt, it's Ben Urich.
-l know who it is. What do you want?

531
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,349
l got a lead on my story.

532
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,674
l think Natchios was set up
by the real Kingpin.

533
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,679
Why are you telling me this?

534
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,230
They say the Kingpin
doesn't just kill you.

535
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,391
He kills your whole family.

536
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,117
l think your girl's in trouble.

537
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,636
l thought you might know
somebody that could protect her.

538
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,392
Remember me?

539
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,319
Wait!

540
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,235
lt wasn't me.

541
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,112
Stop!
lt was a hit man named Bullseye.

542
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,509
-l didn't kill your father.
-Liar.

543
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,958
l want to look into the eyes
of my father's killer as he dies.

544
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,236
Wait. Wait.

545
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,238
Now you know.

546
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,673
Oh, God.

547
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,595
l was just trying to protect you, Elektra.

548
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,514
-l'm sorry.
-Elektra.

549
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,989
That's him. That's Bullseye.

550
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,037
Listen to me. You have to run.

551
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,638
-He has to pay for what he's done.
-No, you don't understand.

552
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,519
l don't want to lose you again.

553
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,070
l'll find you.

554
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,238
Come on, girl.

555
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,595
Hey, orphan. Let's play.

556
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,957
Nice. Come on.

557
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,912
You're good, baby. l'll give you that.

558
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,798
But me. . .

559
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,469
. . .l'm magic.

560
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,158
And now for my next trick.

561
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,476
No! No!

562
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,792
N. Y.P.D. Aviation.
Please do not move.

563
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,872
Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

564
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,353
l repeat, get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

565
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,752
Help me.

566
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,790
Stay. Just stay with me.

567
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,072
Everything's clear.

568
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,512
Matthew. Matthew.

569
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,989
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

570
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,640
l tried, Father.

571
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,268
l tried.

572
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,269
-This is who l am.
-ls that a fact?

573
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,709
First one's a warning. . .

574
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,873
. . .Padre.

575
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,317
-ls there a back door out of here?
-Yeah.

576
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,994
-Take it. Call the police.
-What about you?

577
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,440
-l have to finish this.
-You can't fight like this.

578
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,833
Have faith, Father. lsn't that right?

579
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,352
You.

580
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,919
Let's play.

581
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,149
Kane, l want the blueprints and
the city grids. Secure the perimeter.

582
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,993
-Yes, sir.
-Where the hell's my SWAT team?

583
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,869
Let's go.

584
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,270
Let's go. Let's go.

585
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,193
-Hey, Coyle. Keep them in your sights.
-Which one?

586
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,715
Both of them.
l want a man on that roof.

587
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,154
Ready?

588
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,876
The man without fear. Looks like
l found something you're afraid of.

589
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,349
Let's bring on the pain.

590
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,079
Let's bring on the noise.

591
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,949
Fisk was right about you.
He said you wouldn't go easy.

592
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,396
Fisk? Fisk is the Kingpin?

593
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,073
Yeah.

594
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,350
The whole red rose thing,
he loves that shit. lt's not my style.

595
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:36,111
He hired me to kill Natchios.
And to gut your pretty girlfriend too.

596
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,788
But me, l'm going for the hat trick.

597
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,190
l told him l'd do you for free.

598
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,439
The devil is mine.

599
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,112
Oh, my hands! My hands.

600
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,550
You took away my hands.

601
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,077
Show mercy.

602
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,912
Bull's-eye.

603
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,070
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

604
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,675
Detective, look!

605
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,716
Good luck, son.

606
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,156
There's been a problem.

607
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,117
Bullseye failed.

608
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,633
Correct.

609
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,558
Send the guards home.

610
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,234
-But, sir--
-l was raised in the Bronx, Wesley.

611
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,188
This is something
you wouldn't understand.

612
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,630
Daredevil.

613
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,360
Kingpin.

614
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,514
lt's a shame you came here wounded.

615
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,592
l would have loved to fight you
in your prime.

616
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,597
They call you the man without fear.

617
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,597
lf that's true, why are you afraid
to show your face?

618
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,036
l don't believe it.

619
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,634
No. No.

620
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,429
The blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen?

621
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,830
You killed the only two people
l ever loved.

622
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,274
Why?

623
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,634
Business.

624
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,314
That's all it ever is, business.

625
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,909
l was working for Fallon at the time.

626
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,231
Your father was supposed
to throw a fight. . .

627
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:35,191
. . .and your girl was in the wrong family
at the wrong time.

628
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,911
lt's always business.

629
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,354
l'll find you.

630
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,429
You've been in my business
for too long.

631
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,990
l've been thinking about this day
since l was 1 2 years old.

632
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,474
l don't understand.

633
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,155
l'm not the bad guy.

634
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,792
You hear that, blind man?

635
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,030
The sirens.

636
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,758
They're coming for you.

637
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,630
For me?

638
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,631
Didn't you hear?

639
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,631
The word's out on the Kingpin.

640
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,239
They're coming for you.

641
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,516
l can hear the police radios from here.

642
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,716
No, no.

643
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,519
l swear l'll tell them who you are.

644
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,911
Yeah? Go ahead, tell them.

645
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,868
Tell the guys at Riker's all about
how you got beat by a blind man.

646
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,795
lt'll be like blood in the water.

647
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,797
Don't worry about that,
because l'll get out.

648
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,277
Yeah, l know.

649
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,230
And l'll be waiting.

650
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,473
Justice is served.

651
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,997
l'll get you.

652
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,668
l'll get you.

653
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,795
lt's not over with yet.

654
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,393
Not over with Daredevil.

655
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,358
This is for you, Dad.

656
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,113
"Though there were no witnesses, police
think Daredevil brought Fisk to justice. "

657
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,833
There were no eyewitnesses.

658
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,509
lt's in black and white.
How can you be a skeptic?

659
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,513
lf there's no eyewitnesses--
Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

660
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,750
-Please.
-The alligators in the sewers--

661
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,951
So there are alligators
in the sewers?

662
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,116
l didn't admit that. l'm explaining--

663
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,238
Do you concede that there are
alligators in the sewers?

664
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,389
-Do l concede that? No.
-Answer the question.

665
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,835
How can you not concede? You--

666
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,316
Judy, we're over here.

667
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,035
How you doing?

668
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,752
l'm doing okay. l'll be all right.

669
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,439
You wanna talk about it?

670
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,514
No, but thanks.

671
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,910
-l'm gonna get some air.
-l got this.

672
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,672
Thanks.

673
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,631
l had set out to save the city...

674
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:52,874
...but with Elektra 's help,
l saved myself instead.

675
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,831
Now l have faith
that anything is possible.

676
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,591
Braille.

677
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,396
And some days, faith is all you need.

678
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,032
As for Daredevil, well....

679
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,036
Soon the world will know the truth:

680
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,154
That this is a city born of heroes.

681
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,114
That one man can make a difference.

682
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,031
Go get them, Matt.

683
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,719
Hell's Kitchen is my neighborhood.

684
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,872
l prowl the rooftops and alleyways
at night...

685
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,275
... watching from the darkness.

686
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,159
Forever in darkness...

687
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,633
...a guardian devil.

688
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,395
Bull's-eye.
