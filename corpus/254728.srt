1
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,684
<i>I couldn't believe my cousin Fred</i>
<i>would just show up that way.</i>

2
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:53,677
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>it was absolutely typical.</i>

3
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,692
<i>I was furious, but tried not to show it.</i>

4
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,694
- You could have called.
- I did call.

5
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,697
From a pay phone that cut me off
and swallowed my change.

6
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:06,690
- You called once from the airport.
- At least once. I would not, not call.

7
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:14,709
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Good question.

8
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,712
- More than three days?
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,714
- You know what Dr. Johnson said?
- No.

10
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:23,718
'<i>'</i>Guests, like fish,
begin to stink on the third day.'<i>'</i>

11
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,720
That sounds about right.

12
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,713
You'll find I begin to stink on the first day.

13
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:40,735
I saw the prettiest girl
at the Trade Fair today.

14
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,737
You spoke with her? Of course not.

15
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:46,741
I'm beginning to reconsider my attitude
toward female beauty.

16
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,743
I think it's very bad.

17
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:52,747
You see a beautiful girl
and you're subject to all these emotions.

18
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,749
Some are very powerful,
almost uncontrollable.

19
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,750
Yeah...

20
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,743
They are. You haven't even spoken with
a girl and already you want to marry her.

21
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:01,756
I think...

22
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:04,759
Inordinate concern for beauty
has wrecked more lives...

23
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,761
- Wrecked lives?
- Yeah.

24
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:09,764
- At the lake, Charlie Johnson.
- That was pathetic.

25
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:11,766
There are so many cases.

26
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,769
In our family,
the '<i>'</i>beautiful Boynton sisters'<i>'</i> thing.

27
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,762
- Is this related to you and Betty?
- No, that was different.

28
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,783
There are really attractive girls there.

29
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:31,786
This is where
the cool Trade Fair girls come.

30
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,788
Great. '<i>'</i>Cool Trade Fair girls.'<i>'</i>

31
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:35,790
A lot of people come here.
It's quite popular.

32
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,794
If you wanted to meet cool Trade Fair girls,
you could go to the fair itself.

33
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:42,797
The atmosphere's not so good
and trade fairs are intermittent...

34
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,800
...while the girls come here all the time.

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,803
Trade Fair girls off season. Cool.
This is great stuff.

36
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:52,807
A lot of them studied in London
and have terrific English accents.

37
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:56,800
That's good? I hate that.

38
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,814
Jesus, what was that all about?

39
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:02,817
- What does <i>facha</i> mean?
- It's slang for '<i>'</i>fascist.'<i>'</i>

40
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:03,818
Fascist?

41
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:06,821
Don't worry, they call everyone that.

42
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,823
Comb your hair, wear a tie, you're a <i>facha.</i>

43
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:12,816
- A military uniform? Definitely <i>facha.</i>
- So, <i>facha</i> is something good, then.

44
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:17,832
If it referred to the political movement
Mussolini led, I'd be offended.

45
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:21,825
Men wearing this uniform died
ridding Europe of fascism.

46
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,842
That's the cathedral.

47
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:52,856
These are remnants
of the old Roman walls.

48
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:01,876
The palace of the Catalan government.

49
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:05,869
That's City Hall.

50
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:12,887
Let's call it a night. You're obviously tired.

51
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:15,890
After what happened?
I'm far too worked-up to call it a night.

52
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,893
We had a close call back there.
It could've turned ugly.

53
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:22,897
They obviously didn't mean <i>facha</i>
in the positive sense.

54
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:26,901
With the controversy over NATO, this
may not be the best time for a fleet visit.

55
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,904
There's a lot of anti-NATO feeling here.

56
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,906
- Anti-what?
- Anti-NATO.

57
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:34,909
- Anti-NATO?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,912
Actually, here it's OTAN.

59
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:40,915
- They're against OTAN?
- Yeah.

60
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:44,908
<i>What are they for? Soviet troops racing</i>
<i>across Europe, eating the croissants?</i>

61
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,923
What exactly are you doing here?

62
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:52,927
Advance man for the 6th Fleet.
The last fleet visit was a disaster.

63
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm here early to smooth things out
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

64
00:06:57,932 --> 00:06:59,934
That will be tough.

65
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:03,927
It's an assignment that'll require
a lot of diplomacy and tact.

66
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,941
I'm surprised they gave it to you.

67
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:10,945
It doesn't require that much tact.

68
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,947
This is my favorite Barcelona avenue.

69
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,949
<i>Paseo de Gracia.</i>

70
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,953
It's the Michigan Avenue of Barcelona.

71
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,955
Yeah, nice.

72
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:22,957
After all that's happened tonight...

73
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:25,960
...I won't be able to sleep
without more to drink.

74
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,963
This avenue is <i>Diagonal.</i>

75
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:32,956
Actually it's more like Michigan Avenue.

76
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:41,976
This thing of always falling in love
with incredibly attractive girls is...

77
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,978
...really bad.

78
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,982
Maybe by resolving to go out
only with plain, or even homely, girls...

79
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:48,983
...I could avoid all that.

80
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:52,987
I've got a real romantic illusion problem.

81
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:56,991
Instead of fantasy built on the slope
of an eyebrow or curl of an upper lip...

82
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:00,995
...to see the real person,
look into her eyes and see her soul.

83
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:01,996
What?

84
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:05,989
I've resolved to go out only with plain,
or even homely, girls.

85
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:10,004
What if, and this is hypothetical...

86
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:13,007
...the one girl with whom
you'd be happiest...

87
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:16,010
...with the most wonderful personality,
or soul imaginable...

88
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,011
...also was incredibly attractive?

89
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,014
According to your theory,
you wouldn't even look at her.

90
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:22,016
I'd look at her.
I just wouldn't go out with her.

91
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:25,019
Your one chance at happiness
would be gone.

92
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,023
I don't buy that there's just one girl
who's right for you.

93
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:32,026
There are a lot of terrific plain
or homely women.

94
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:35,029
What if you don't meet any of those girls?

95
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,033
What if the only women you meet and like,
are also very attractive?

96
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,034
Do you think I'm an idiot?

97
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:44,038
If the only women I meet that I like
are attractive, I'd make an exception.

98
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,042
Why did I tell you about this?
I must be drunk.

99
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,045
No, you can confide in me.

100
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:53,047
It was just an idea.

101
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:56,050
Good, because it sounded pathetic. Crazy.

102
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,043
Thanks.

103
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,073
<i>Cerdos</i>? Pigs?

104
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:20,074
They're calling us pigs.

105
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:22,076
It's meant to hurt.

106
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,078
Let's go.

107
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:26,080
Do you have any paint or a marker?

108
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,083
No!

109
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,086
- Forget it.
- I'm not going to forget it!

110
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:35,089
People have forgotten things for too long.

111
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,091
This is not our country.

112
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:40,094
You shouldn't be doing that.
We're guests here.

113
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:42,096
How blind can you be?

114
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:46,089
People like you make me sick!

115
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:02,116
Okay.

116
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,118
That's it. Let's go.

117
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:06,120
You just leave it like that?

118
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,122
'<i>'</i>Yankee pigs go 'hoem"<i>'</i>?

119
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:11,125
You'll paint the wall with a ballpoint pen?

120
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,126
It's a felt-tip.

121
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:16,119
Give me a break. I'm going.

122
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,134
Listen, I'm going.

123
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:23,137
I'm out of here.

124
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:27,141
<i>Ciervo</i> has a '<i>'</i>v'<i>'</i> not a '<i>'</i>b'<i>'.</i>

125
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:28,142
It's correct phonetically.

126
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:30,144
'<i>'</i>Yankee deer.'<i>'</i>

127
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:33,147
How is that an improvement?
'<i>'</i>Yankee deer go home.'<i>'</i>

128
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:37,140
Would you prefer to be
a Yankee pig or a Yankee deer?

129
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,160
Ted.

130
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,163
What are you doing here?

131
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:53,156
- You're going to the same party as we are.
- Yes.

132
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:58,161
Good.

133
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:03,177
We haven't met.
You're some royal personage?

134
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,179
Isabel de Farnesio.

135
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:08,182
My cousin Fred.
Marta works at the Trade Fair.

136
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:10,184
I like your costume.

137
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:13,187
Have you no costume, Ted?

138
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:15,189
We must go.

139
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,192
Let's split up. I'll go in your car and...

140
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:21,195
...the princesses in Ted's.

141
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:25,188
Yes?

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,193
Okay.

143
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:37,200
- Where in England did you learn English?
- Providence, Rhode Island.

144
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:46,220
He's not at all the way he seems.

145
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,223
He seems a typical American,
a big, unsophisticated child...

146
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:51,225
...but he's more complex.

147
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:55,229
- Really?
- Heard of the Marquis de Sade?

148
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:57,231
Ted's great admirer of de Sade.

149
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:59,233
And a follower of Dr. Johnson.

150
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,237
He's a complex, and in some ways,
dangerous man.

151
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:07,241
He has a romantic illusion problem.
Women find him fascinating.

152
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:11,234
His nickname is <i>punta de diamante</i>,
point of a diamond.

153
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:15,249
See that odd expression on his face?

154
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,252
Under the normal clothes he wears...

155
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:22,245
...are narrow leather straps,
drawn taut, so when he dances<i>...</i>

156
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:24,258
What?

157
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:27,261
Don't mention this.
He'd feel I violated a confidence.

158
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,263
Thank you.

159
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:33,256
Sit here.

160
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:36,270
What's wrong?

161
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,272
- I told them your nicknames.
- You're kidding.

162
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:41,275
- Marta wanted to know.
- Ted, what are your names?

163
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,277
- Don't.
- I only remember two others.

164
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:46,280
Don't get into that.

165
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,284
- What difference is it going to make?
- I mean it. Really. Don't.

166
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,286
I'm supposed to be the childish one.

167
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:55,289
- Lf he doesn't want to talk about it...
- It's the principle.

168
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:58,292
- Principle?
- '<i>'</i>Crusty Fusty'<i>'</i> and '<i>'</i>The Big O.'<i>'</i>

169
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,293
Jerk!

170
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:02,296
- What does that mean?
- I don't believe you.

171
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,298
What is the big deal?

172
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:06,300
It's just...

173
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,302
...lousy.

174
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:11,305
Give me a break! Don't go.

175
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:14,308
You're right. You do stink on the first day.

176
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:18,301
Good-bye.

177
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:24,318
That guy really gets to me.

178
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:27,321
I admit I act like a jerk around him,
but he provokes it.

179
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,324
Are those names related
to his <i>sadomasoquismo</i>?

180
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:34,317
No, it's something<i>...</i> Did you hear
that crack he made about my intelligence?

181
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:41,324
Should we dance?

182
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,353
<i>Sometimes we think...</i>

183
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:03,357
...we almost always assume, we're going
through life surrounded by people.

184
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:07,350
Then something happens and you realize:
We're entirely alone.

185
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:09,363
Tonight, while shaving...

186
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:13,356
...I always shave against the beard
for a closer shave...

187
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:18,361
...I remembered this razor ad on TV
showing the hair follicles, like this.

188
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,376
The first of the twin blades cuts them here.

189
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:25,379
Then the hair snaps back
and the second blade cuts them here...

190
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,382
...for a closer, cleaner shave.
That we know.

191
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,384
But what struck me was:

192
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:34,377
If the hair follicles are going
in this direction and the razor is too...

193
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,393
...then they're shaving in the direction
of the beard, not against it.

194
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,396
So I've shaved the wrong way all my life.

195
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,398
Maybe I misremembered the ad.
The point is...

196
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:48,402
...I could've shaved the wrong way
all my life and never have known it.

197
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:52,395
Then I could have taught my son
to shave the wrong way, too.

198
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:58,412
You have a son?

199
00:14:58,412 --> 00:14:59,413
No.

200
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:03,406
But I might someday. Then, maybe
I'll teach him to shave the wrong way.

201
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:07,421
I think maybe my English is not so good.

202
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:10,424
Did you know that your costume
has your name in it?

203
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:14,428
Where?

204
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:18,421
God. How odd!

205
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:37,500
First, we check with Seat and Opel.

206
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:41,515
<i>Fred's thesis that I'd never meet</i>
<i>any terrific plain girls...</i>

207
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:43,517
<i>... was already inoperative.</i>

208
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:46,520
<i>Aurora, the princess with Marta</i>
<i>at the costume party...</i>

209
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,513
<i>... invited me to a Lionel Hampton concert</i>
<i>Thursday night.</i>

210
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:56,530
<i>Fred began his advance work</i>
<i>with a visit to the consulate...</i>

211
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,533
<i>... which was less than a complete success.</i>

212
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,535
I saw it as a judgment call.

213
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,537
You were unaware of this order?

214
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:07,541
I thought it applied to the khaki uniform.
Not the blue one, too.

215
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,544
- You're ROTC?
- Yes, I am.

216
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:13,547
This order, I must admit, troubles me.

217
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:17,551
Men in this uniform died, ridding Europe
of fascism. I'm proud of this uniform.

218
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:21,555
- It seems a bit cowardly to...
- Come on.

219
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:25,548
The thing is,
I don't have any good civilian clothes.

220
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:31,565
The blue one, I think.

221
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:34,568
- You don't mind my borrowing it?
- No.

222
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:36,570
- Really?
- It's okay.

223
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,573
Spanish girls tend to be promiscuous.

224
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:42,576
- You're such a prig.
- I didn't mean '<i>'</i>promiscuous'<i>'</i> pejoratively.

225
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:44,578
It's just a fact.

226
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:47,581
They have a completely
different attitude towards sex.

227
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:51,574
I wasn't using '<i>'</i>prig'<i>'</i> pejoratively.

228
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,592
Okay, I'm a prig.

229
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:01,595
But, now I'm speaking sociologically.

230
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:05,588
The sexual revolution reached Spain
later than the US, but went beyond it.

231
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,593
I don't know what it was like
in other cities, but in Barcelona...

232
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:14,608
...everything was swept aside.
The world was turned upside down...

233
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,610
...and stayed there.

234
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,614
Maybe the world was upside down before,
and now it's right-side up.

235
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:24,607
No. I don't think that's it.

236
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:32,626
I'm going out with Aurora on Thursday,
so I thought I'd read tonight.

237
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:34,628
Aurora?

238
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,630
The very nice, plain girl with Marta.

239
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,634
She had extra tickets for a jazz concert.

240
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:44,627
Jazz concert? That's tough.
You really are polite.

241
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,644
- Is this how you dress to go out?
- Yes.

242
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:52,646
Your Trade Fair outfit is so cool.

243
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,649
- Those clothes are awful.
- Really? I think they're cool.

244
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:59,653
Why do I always look better in mirrors
than in photographs?

245
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,655
I like your outfit. Very New Wave.

246
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,657
- You sure you don't want to go?
- No.

247
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:07,650
Good.

248
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,669
<i>Except for work,</i>
<i>I'd been in a funk for some time.</i>

249
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:18,672
<i>I'd never mention that to Fred.</i>

250
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:22,676
<i>He was the last person to trust</i>
<i>with a personal confidence.</i>

251
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:25,679
<i>I don't know whether I had found God</i>
<i>in Barcelona...</i>

252
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,681
<i>... or was having a religious phase.</i>

253
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:31,685
<i>It all began after the sad and guilt-ridden</i>
<i>break up with Betty...</i>

254
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:34,688
<i>... with whom I'd been deeply involved,</i>
<i>including carnally...</i>

255
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,690
<i>... despite never having loved her.</i>

256
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,693
<i>The attraction of physical beauty...</i>

257
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:43,697
<i>... transformed a good friendship</i>
<i>into a horrible pre-marital situation.</i>

258
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:47,690
<i>This led directly to the Old Testament.</i>

259
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:53,707
<i>Two Old Testament books, in particular...</i>

260
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:57,700
<i>... included advice on romantic matters,</i>
<i>some of it, very tough.</i>

261
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:16,730
<i>After what happened with Betty,</i>
<i>I resolved not to sleep with any girl...</i>

262
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,723
<i>... until I met the one I wanted to marry</i>
<i>and spend the rest of my life with.</i>

263
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:29,732
<i>I had no idea if I'd meet such a person</i>
<i>or if she existed, plain or not.</i>

264
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:38,741
<i>My aspiration was to free romance</i>
<i>from the chains of beauty and carnality...</i>

265
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:43,746
<i>... and stop doing harm.</i>

266
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:07,781
What's going on?

267
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,783
What are you doing here?

268
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:12,786
Is this some strange Glenn Miller-based
religious ceremony?

269
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:14,788
No, Presbyterian.

270
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:16,790
Is this your Presbyterian church?

271
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,792
Well, Protestant.

272
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:22,796
- Protestant churches are like this?
- Pretty much.

273
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:26,800
I didn't get a chance
to change any money today.

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,803
- How much?
- Would $100 be possible?

275
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:33,807
Actually, I don't have it on me.
I'm waiting for a transfer.

276
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:36,810
If you want to borrow 10,000 pesetas,
just say so.

277
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,813
- I can give you a check for it.
- I'd like the money back.

278
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:43,806
Of course.

279
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:48,811
- You'll get it back.
- Sure.

280
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:02,825
<i>What made my isolation bearable</i>
<i>was my work for IHSMOCO...</i>

281
00:22:03,837 --> 00:22:07,841
<i>... the Illinois High-Speed</i>
<i>Motor Corporation.</i>

282
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,843
<i>Like everyone,</i>
<i>I'd seen Arthur Miller's play...</i>

283
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:13,836
<i>... and, as a youth, had the usual</i>
<i>deprecating attitude to business and sales.</i>

284
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,842
<i>That changed when Professor Thompson's</i>
<i>business course convinced us...</i>

285
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:24,847
<i>... that even the mundane world of business</i>
<i>had its romance.</i>

286
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,863
<i>A job interview with IHSMOCO led</i>
<i>to employment and its training program.</i>

287
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:33,856
<i>I arrived in sales just as</i>
<i>the flu epidemic struck and never left.</i>

288
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,873
<i>In sales I found not just a job,</i>
<i>but a culture.</i>

289
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:42,876
<i>Franklin, Emerson, Carnegie and Bettger</i>
<i>were our philosophers...</i>

290
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:46,880
<i>... and thanks to Carnegie's</i>
<i>theory of human relations...</i>

291
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,882
<i>... many customers also became friends.</i>

292
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:52,886
I don't consider high-pressure sales
sales at all. It's a form of fraud.

293
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,889
In true sales, you provide a real
and constructive service...

294
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,893
...help people improve their lives
or make companies more efficient...

295
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,895
...and so create wonderful economies
of scale...

296
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:04,898
...from which everyone
and the whole economy benefit.

297
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:08,902
<i>The classic literature of self-improvement</i>
<i>really was improving.</i>

298
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:12,906
Here's something good.
It's Bettger quoting George Adams:

299
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:16,910
'<i>'</i>The wisest and best salesman
bluntly tells the truth about his article.

300
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,912
'<i>'</i>That is always impressive.

301
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:21,915
'<i>'</i>lf he does not sell the first time,
he leaves a trail of trust behind.

302
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:25,908
'<i>'</i>Being bluntly honest is always safe
and best.'<i>'</i>

303
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,924
<i>Other books, magazines, and tapes</i>
<i>mixed practical tips with home truths.</i>

304
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:34,928
<i>Each time you handle a paper,</i>
<i>mark it with a red dot.</i>

305
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:37,931
<i>If you encounter papers</i>
<i>with three or four dots...</i>

306
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,933
<i>... you could work more efficiently.</i>

307
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,936
<i>Try to dispose of each paper</i>
<i>the first time you handle it.</i>

308
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:45,939
<i>The enthusiastic tone</i>
<i>of much of this literature...</i>

309
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,942
<i>... did open it up to the ridicule of half-wits.</i>

310
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:52,935
Maybe I could use these same techniques
in my Navy career.

311
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:57,940
'<i>'</i>Every day, in every way, I'm becoming
a better and better lieutenant.'<i>'</i>

312
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:02,945
That's autosuggestion,
popularized by Coué, but totally unserious.

313
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:07,961
What I'm talking about,
has nothing to do with that.

314
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:11,965
<i>I loved coming into the office early</i>
<i>to catch up on the overnight telex traffic.</i>

315
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,968
<i>The telex was our umbilical cord</i>
<i>to Chicago...</i>

316
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:17,971
<i>... and confirmations for bigger sales</i>
<i>came through it, too.</i>

317
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:18,972
What's wrong?

318
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:22,965
- Dickie Taylor's going to supervise sales.
- The Dickie Taylor of Marketing?

319
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:27,981
I can't believe it. Work for that guy?

320
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:30,984
I'm sure he's going to get me fired.

321
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:34,977
No. You are the best they have.
They cannot do that.

322
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:45,999
<i>I really looked forward to seeing Aurora</i>
<i>that night.</i>

323
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:49,992
<i>I had this image of looking into her eyes</i>
<i>and seeing her soul.</i>

324
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:02,004
<i>But she was late, which was actually</i>
<i>not that common in Barcelona.</i>

325
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:06,019
Oh, it's you.

326
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,012
Aurora can't come.
Please excuse my retard.

327
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:20,033
Two weeks ago Aurora had a <i>flechazo.</i>

328
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,035
What's a <i>flechazo</i>?

329
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:26,039
It means dropping crazily
in love with someone...

330
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,043
...as if an arrow had entered your heart,
shot by one of those little boy angels.

331
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:34,047
Aurora had a crazy adventure
with this man, but he got too serious.

332
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:38,051
- She wanted an adventure with you.
- An adventure?

333
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,053
But her boyfriend got angry
and pressured her.

334
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:44,046
- Aurora has a boyfriend?
- Yes.

335
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:47,060
'<i>'</i>Vinyl Hampton.'<i>'</i>

336
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,063
I was sure that Aurora said,
'<i>'</i>Lionel Hampton.'<i>'</i>

337
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:54,056
I've never heard of Vinyl Hampton.

338
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,081
How could you tell I felt that way?

339
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:12,074
During the whole concert,
your expression was like this.

340
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:15,088
- You're very perceptive.
- What?

341
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:18,091
- You're very perceptive.
- What?

342
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:22,095
You are very perceptive.

343
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:26,088
- Thank you.
- I don't like perceptiveness of that kind.

344
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:33,106
<i>It's a typical pretty-girl thing...</i>

345
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:37,099
...using observation for ridicule,
as if impertinence were cute and charming.

346
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:41,114
My impression of Aurora is...

347
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:45,118
...that she'd be more apt to use
observation for comprehension.

348
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:48,121
- You don't think Aurora's pretty?
- No.

349
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,124
But she's beautiful.

350
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:53,126
- Physically?
- Yes.

351
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:56,129
- Her eyes<i>...</i>
- She's beautiful because of her eyes?

352
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:57,130
Yes.

353
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,134
She also has a beautiful<i>...</i>

354
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:04,137
- Figure?
- Yes.

355
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:08,130
Apparently, you are just the sort
of dangerous, foreign man she likes.

356
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:11,144
What do you mean?

357
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:13,146
Your brother told her about your interests.

358
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:15,148
- What?
- You know?

359
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,149
No.

360
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:20,153
The Marquis de Sade, games of leather,
weekends of fun.

361
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:22,155
The straps under your clothes.

362
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:23,156
He said that?

363
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:25,158
That's completely untrue.

364
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:28,161
He promised
he wouldn't say that anymore.

365
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:31,164
He's not my brother.

366
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:34,167
You don't know anything
about the Marquis de Sade?

367
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,169
No.

368
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:40,162
I don't believe you.

369
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:49,182
So you're not wearing them tonight.
That doesn't prove anything.

370
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:53,175
Maybe they're at the cleaners.

371
00:27:56,189 --> 00:28:00,193
<i>It turned out we both loved</i>
<i>disco music of the late 1970s...</i>

372
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:04,197
<i>... despite what everyone else thought.</i>

373
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:06,199
<i>We talked about all kinds of things.</i>

374
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:10,203
You know how at parties
people talk about marketing?

375
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:11,204
No.

376
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:14,207
I've never heard people at a party
talk about marketing.

377
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:17,210
This idea of marketing being a science.

378
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,203
If you look at the evidence,
it's all anecdotal.

379
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:27,220
<i>It was during a Donna Summer song</i>
<i>that it happened...</i>

380
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,213
<i>... or that I realized it had.</i>

381
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,223
<i>Everything was completely different now.</i>

382
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,242
The things they say about us.

383
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:52,245
I know we're not to take it seriously,
but it really hurts.

384
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,246
I don't believe you!

385
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:57,239
Once, I'd like to date a girl not certain
I'm wearing black leather underwear.

386
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:00,253
That bothers you?

387
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:04,246
- The exact same story over and over!
- It's not exactly the same. I vary it a little.

388
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:09,251
Great! It wasn't Aurora, but this
terrific friend of hers from the Trade Fair.

389
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:14,267
She's never met you
but was still full of your stupid stories.

390
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:18,271
Frankly, I don't care for your tone.

391
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:21,274
You should thank God you have a cousin
who makes up interesting stories.

392
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:24,277
I'm the best P.R. Guy you'll ever have.

393
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:27,280
Do you think any cool Trade Fair girl
would give you the time of day...

394
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,273
...if she knew the pathetic Bible-dancing
goody-goody you are?

395
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:35,288
You're far weirder than someone merely
into S & M.

396
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:36,289
At least they have a tradition.

397
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:39,292
We have an idea what S and M is,
from movies and books.

398
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:43,285
But there is nothing to explain
the way you are.

399
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:17,319
Hi, Ted. Go to the front
and we will come down.

400
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,343
Haven't you noticed the way he makes digs
at my intelligence?

401
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:32,345
No.

402
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:34,347
In the US,
we take these tests called College Boards...

403
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:37,350
...to go to a university
that's selective, highly selective...

404
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,353
...or not at all selective,
which is where I went.

405
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:42,355
My Board scores were bad.

406
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:44,357
You seem very intelligent for an American.

407
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:47,360
Well, I'm not.

408
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,364
The worst part was Ted
getting 800 Boards, perfect scores.

409
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:55,368
I've met other people with 800 Boards
and they didn't seem intelligent either.

410
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:59,361
- So Ted is very smart.
- He tests well.

411
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,384
I think it's true that the height
of the sexual revolution is over.

412
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:13,386
I don't go to bed
with just anyone anymore...

413
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:16,389
...I have to be attracted to them sexually.

414
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:20,393
I thought women had to have
an emotional bond with a man.

415
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:24,397
A secure, romantic relationship,
before they became interested...

416
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:26,399
...in a relation of that kind.

417
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,392
Oh, no.

418
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:37,410
Using his position to get involved
with a 15-year old student?

419
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,414
Nothing really happened until summer.
By then I was 16.

420
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:42,415
Oh, well, 16<i>...</i>

421
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:45,418
Also, I had something to do with it.

422
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:49,422
Still. Just from the little you've said.
I really hate that guy.

423
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:53,415
In truth, much of what you say
reminds me of Ramon then.

424
00:31:54,427 --> 00:31:57,430
Ramon soon left from teaching
to return to the newspaper.

425
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,433
He had read the works of Philip Agee...

426
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:03,436
...so he was an expert
on the American CIA...

427
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:06,439
...and its involvement
in the internal affairs of every country.

428
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,440
Terrific.

429
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,444
One year, the correspondent of fashion
of his newspaper fell ill...

430
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:15,448
...before the Milan collections
and Ramon was sent in her place.

431
00:32:15,448 --> 00:32:19,452
Ramon came back from Milan
with a new idea...

432
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:23,456
...which he referred to
as the '<i>'</i>idea of physical beauty.'<i>'</i>

433
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:25,458
What's that?

434
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,460
His thought was that...

435
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,464
...beauty is the closest thing to divinity
in the modern world.

436
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:34,467
All the old gods are dead.
There is no God that we know.

437
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:38,471
But in beauty,
the memory of divinity remains.

438
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:39,472
For always after...

439
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:43,465
...beauty was the subject Ramon
wanted to dedicate his journalism to.

440
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:47,480
He wanted to write about
flowers and things?

441
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,482
No.

442
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:53,475
It was the beauty of the female face
and form that fascinated Ramon.

443
00:32:56,489 --> 00:33:00,493
He transferred to the Style of Life
section of the newspaper...

444
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:03,496
...where he did series
on photographer's models...

445
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:06,499
...and on the young women
who aspire to be actresses.

446
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:10,503
The articles were accompanied by photos,
and, as Ramon is a good writer...

447
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:13,506
...they were very popular with readers.

448
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:14,507
That makes sense.

449
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:18,500
There's something powerful
about the idea of physical beauty.

450
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:21,514
He's not stupid.

451
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:25,518
It was important for Ramon's career
as a journalist.

452
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:27,520
He started appearing on television.

453
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,513
He spent part of each month in Madrid.

454
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:36,529
But, our physical relation ended
almost completely.

455
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:40,533
He wanted an open relation
and encouraged me to go with other men.

456
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:41,534
What?

457
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:45,538
- He thought I should go with other men.
- But you refused.

458
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:47,540
No.

459
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,543
When did you break up?

460
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:54,536
- '<i>'</i>Break up'<i>'</i>?
- Separate. Break apart as a couple.

461
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:58,551
We haven't broken apart.

462
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:02,544
We live together.

463
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:18,571
- Jesus, what was that?
- I don't know.

464
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:22,564
That's where the USO is.

465
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,572
<i>A sailor from Brooklyn died</i>
<i>in the USO bombing.</i>

466
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:34,587
<i>Fred thought we should wait</i>
<i>with the sailor's friend...</i>

467
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:38,580
<i>... for the midnight plane</i>
<i>that was going to take the casket home.</i>

468
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:43,596
He had a good voice. Very deep.
He liked to sing old Johnny Cash songs.

469
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:47,600
I really like those<i>. Ring of Fire.</i>

470
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,593
- He hoped to be a Brooklyn Johnny Cash.
- What a shame.

471
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:55,608
- Johnny Cash?
- Yeah.

472
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:58,611
Where'd you get the Old Crow?

473
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,612
The Consul.

474
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:03,605
So he's not such a bad guy.

475
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:08,610
We should get started.

476
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:20,622
'<i>'</i>Our Father, preserve us from the dangers
of the seas and the violence of enemies.

477
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:23,636
'<i>'</i>Bless the United States.

478
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:25,638
'<i>'</i>Watch over those upon the deep...

479
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:29,631
'<i>'...</i>and protect the inhabitants of the land
in peace and quiet.

480
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:42,644
'<i>'</i>All hands bury the dead.

481
00:35:45,658 --> 00:35:47,660
'<i>'</i>Unto Almighty God...

482
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,653
'<i>'...</i>we commend the soul
of our brother departed.'<i>'</i>

483
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:17,690
There are many parties tonight.
At least three we should go to.

484
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,692
- Three parties?
- Or four.

485
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:21,694
Will that guy be at any of them?

486
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:25,687
I'm sure.

487
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:41,714
- That guy's here.
- Yes.

488
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:45,707
- Want to go?
- No.

489
00:36:49,722 --> 00:36:52,725
You can't say Americans are not
more violent than other people?

490
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:53,726
No!

491
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:56,729
All those people killed in shootings
in America?

492
00:36:56,729 --> 00:37:00,733
Shootings. That doesn't mean Americans
are more violent than other people.

493
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:02,735
We're just better shots.

494
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:05,738
Jack refocused IHSMOCO
on what he saw as its real business.

495
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:08,741
'<i>'</i>This means motors
and they must be fast,'<i>'</i> he'd say.

496
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:12,734
Jack's one of those magnetic personalities
from the World War II generation.

497
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:15,748
He was with Wild Bill Donovan
in the OSS...

498
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,751
...and parachuted into Sicily
before the Allied landings.

499
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:22,755
He's supposed to come to Barcelona
this summer. I hope you can meet him.

500
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,757
Why should I meet him?

501
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:27,760
He's one of the last of the greats.

502
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,764
It's wonderful having work you like
and a boss you admire.

503
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:34,767
Lately, there have been some problems.
I don't know what's going on.

504
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:38,760
I haven't heard from Jack
and he's put this terrible guy over us.

505
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:42,775
Dickie Taylor.
He's this incredible jerk who...

506
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:43,776
Jesus!

507
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:45,778
- What's wrong?
- This music.

508
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:49,782
- How can anybody dance to this?
- It's not dance music.

509
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:51,784
That explains it.

510
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:53,786
What is it? It sounds familiar.

511
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:56,789
- It's Vinyl Hampton.
- Oh, God.

512
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:59,792
Isn't there dancing at parties here?

513
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:03,796
It's too early for dancing.

514
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:07,800
- You don't like jazz?
- No.

515
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,803
I've never heard of anyone
who didn't like jazz.

516
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:13,806
Really? How odd.

517
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:15,808
You really hate jazz?

518
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,801
My jazz rule is: If you can't dance to it,
you don't want to know about it.

519
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:26,808
Come on.

520
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,813
Come on.

521
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:00,853
This is almost impossible to do.

522
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:04,846
I always forget that. Maybe it is too early.

523
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:15,868
Take hamburgers.
Here, <i>hamburguesas</i> are really bad.

524
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:19,872
It's known that Americans like hamburgers,
so again, we're idiots.

525
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:23,876
But they have no idea
how delicious hamburgers can be.

526
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,878
It's this ideal burger of memory we crave...

527
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:28,881
...not the disgusting burgers
you get abroad.

528
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:30,883
We can't even call ourselves Americans.

529
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:33,886
They love to correct you, saying,
'<i>'</i>South Americans are Americans too.'<i>'</i>

530
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:37,890
- Give me a break.
- <i>Norteamericano</i> is the correct term.

531
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,894
But that makes no distinction
between us or Canadians.

532
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:44,897
'<i>'</i>Yankee'<i>'</i> and '<i>'Gringo</i>'<i>'</i>
are obviously pejorative...

533
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:48,901
...but it's the standard dictionary term
that's the most insulting<i>. Estadounidense.</i>

534
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:50,903
Dense.

535
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:51,904
D-E-N-S-E.

536
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:53,906
It's the same spelling. Dense.
Thick, stupid.

537
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:57,910
Every time you hear it, <i>Estadouni</i>- dense.
It's a direct slap in the face. Incredible.

538
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,913
You're too sensitive.

539
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:04,906
Great! Now we're too sensitive!

540
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:16,929
Fred, listen. I'm sorry. Are you joking?

541
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:18,931
You weren't really offended by that,
were you?

542
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:22,935
- I like being called dishonest.
- I did not call you dishonest.

543
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:25,938
When we were kids,
I borrowed some things.

544
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:28,941
It was never, ever theft.
I either told you or was about to.

545
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:32,934
I was joking. You're really overreacting.

546
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:35,948
You're right. I somewhat overreacted.

547
00:40:35,948 --> 00:40:39,941
Before I realized it, I was already out
the door and too embarrassed to go back.

548
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:44,957
- The coffee's strange here.
- In Barcelona?

549
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:46,959
It's really messed me up.

550
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,961
You were so condescending.

551
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:52,965
You think I went into the Navy
because I washed out at Shearson.

552
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:55,968
- I don't know what happened in New York.
- I didn't wash out.

553
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:59,972
There was no disgrace.
They said I could go back.

554
00:40:59,972 --> 00:41:03,976
I dreaded 40 years stuck indoors with
two weeks to go snorkeling annually.

555
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:05,978
A Naval officer has the rare job...

556
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:09,982
...that deals with the physical world
all day, and it counts.

557
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:11,984
It is not theoretical.

558
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,987
You dominate the elements
in four dimensions without a slip-up...

559
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:17,990
...or it gets very wet.

560
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,994
And all that fighting for freedom,
defending democracy, shining stuff...

561
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:23,996
...which as you know, I really buy.

562
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:28,000
Jesus. That's right. You do.

563
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,993
The bill has come.

564
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:38,010
Must have been like this, the night
F. Key wrote the <i>Star-Spangled Banner.</i>

565
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,003
Yeah.

566
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:47,019
- You have already finished?
- Yeah, it's like 2:00 a.m.

567
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:50,022
Ramon was talking so fascinatingly,
I stayed to listen.

568
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:53,025
What was so fascinating?

569
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:57,018
He was talking about the AFL-CIA
and the American labor unions.

570
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:03,035
He described how, after World War II,
men from the American labor union...

571
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:07,039
...the AFL-CIA were sent to Europe
to crush progressive unionism.

572
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:09,041
How'd they do that?

573
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:13,045
With sacks of money and the
anti-Communist tactics of Joe McCarthy.

574
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:15,047
The AFL-CIA?

575
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:18,050
America's largest union,
terribly right wing and <i>facha.</i>

576
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,052
You have not heard of it?

577
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:24,045
It's amazing the things Americans
don't know about their country.

578
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:29,061
There's no such thing as the AFL-CIA.

579
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:31,063
It's the AFL-CIO.

580
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:34,066
Actually, it's the A.F. Of L.C.I.O.

581
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:38,059
It was formed when the AFL merged
with the more militant CIO.

582
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:41,073
How do you know so much about it?

583
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:44,076
Chicago is the capital of 20th century
American trade-unionism.

584
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:48,069
The American labor leaders
who came to Europe, Jay Lovestone and<i>...</i>

585
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:51,083
...were giants.

586
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,085
So what Marta said was partly true.

587
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:57,089
What do you mean, '<i>'</i>partly true'<i>'</i>?
They were people.

588
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:01,082
I'm sure I've heard of the AFL-CIA.
It's some important American labor union.

589
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:13,094
So now it's late enough to dance.

590
00:43:21,113 --> 00:43:25,117
There's an empty room
where you could work during the day.

591
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:28,120
Are you proposing we shake up together?

592
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,121
Shack up together.

593
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:33,125
You use '<i>'</i>shacked up'<i>'</i> when you don't like
one of the people involved.

594
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:37,118
You and Ramon were shacked up.
We'd be living together.

595
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:42,134
What about Fred?

596
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:46,127
He's moving out.

597
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:56,137
- She's a model he was interviewing.
- He's just all work. The creep.

598
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,143
Ramon might not be as bad as you think.
There's a reason he has so many women.

599
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:06,158
- He has a problem.
- What?

600
00:44:06,158 --> 00:44:10,151
After he knows a woman well,
he can't have sex with her well.

601
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:15,167
He has a sexual impotence problem
of some kind?

602
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,169
- Of some kind.
- That's terrible.

603
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:18,170
Poor guy.

604
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,173
- It explains a lot.
- What?

605
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:25,177
It's well-known that anti-Americanism
has its roots in sexual impotence.

606
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:28,180
At least, in Europe.

607
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,183
There's no union called the AFL-CIA,
is there?

608
00:44:31,183 --> 00:44:35,176
- No.
- Give me a break.

609
00:44:36,188 --> 00:44:40,181
This bombing reminds one strongly
of the US blowing up its own ship.

610
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:42,194
The <i>Maine...</i>

611
00:44:42,194 --> 00:44:46,187
...in Havana harbor as the pretext
for starting the War of 1898.

612
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,202
An American sailor died in the bombing.

613
00:44:50,202 --> 00:44:54,206
It's hard for me to believe even
the Americans would kill their own people.

614
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:55,207
No.

615
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:58,210
The American elections are approaching.

616
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,213
A quick attack
on some foreign bogeyman...

617
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:05,206
...Libya or Iran, might rescue the American
president's reclining popularity.

618
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:08,220
The American 6th Fleet...

619
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,223
...which was to have
shown the pendant here this week...

620
00:45:11,223 --> 00:45:15,216
...is still sailing the South Mediterranean,
awaiting such a pretext.

621
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:19,231
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. Poor guy.

622
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,235
The most disgusting slanders!
Someone's gotta say something.

623
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:24,236
No, don't.

624
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:27,239
This scumbag is going around saying...

625
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,243
...that the USO bombing was arranged
by the Americans themselves.

626
00:45:31,243 --> 00:45:34,246
That's a lie!

627
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:35,247
What?

628
00:45:35,247 --> 00:45:37,249
Everything you said.

629
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:41,253
The Americans exploding their own ship,
the <i>Maine</i>, in 1898...

630
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:43,255
...is a historical fact, established well.

631
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:47,248
The other is still a thesis,
but an increasingly likely one.

632
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,262
Both are disgusting lies.

633
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:54,255
No, Ted. All the history books
say that about the <i>Maine.</i>

634
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:57,269
Scumbag.

635
00:45:57,269 --> 00:45:59,271
I'm the one who's supposed to go berserk.

636
00:45:59,271 --> 00:46:03,275
- You could've helped me out.
- I can't get into political arguments.

637
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:04,276
- You did fine.
- Yeah.

638
00:46:04,276 --> 00:46:08,280
I made a complete fool of myself.
It's one of the first rules of sales:

639
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,284
'<i>'</i>Never get involved in matters of public
controversy.'<i>'</i> But I couldn't not reply.

640
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:16,288
No. Don't get into a funk about it.
Who was really listening?

641
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:19,291
- Four or five good timers at some party.
- Twenty people, at least.

642
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:23,284
So you made a fool of yourself
in front of 20 or 30 people. So what?

643
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:46,318
No, I really like it here.
I'm really comfortable.

644
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,321
We talked about you staying three days.
It's been much longer.

645
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:53,325
I thought with the fleet delayed
you'd want another place to stay.

646
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:54,326
No.

647
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:56,328
This is nice.

648
00:46:56,328 --> 00:47:00,332
The thing is,
I'm trying to get Montserrat to move in.

649
00:47:00,332 --> 00:47:03,335
That's great. I really like Montserrat.

650
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:07,328
- Won't you think of staying at Marta's?
- No.

651
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,344
Since being here, I've begun to realize
how important family is.

652
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:15,347
You and I are family.
I want to be with family now.

653
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:18,350
I want to be with Montserrat.

654
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,353
I'm really surprised at you
shacking up with her.

655
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:25,346
I would have thought
that was against your morals.

656
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,352
You really want me out of here, don't you?

657
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:43,375
I still need to pick up my music
from his apartment.

658
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:47,379
- What music?
- My radio cassette and tapes of music.

659
00:47:47,379 --> 00:47:51,383
The situation is still raw.
You really need those things urgently?

660
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:53,385
I really need them urgently.

661
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:57,378
It seems unwise to go back so soon
after you broke apart.

662
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,394
What does that mean?

663
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:06,387
Suit yourself.

664
00:48:54,446 --> 00:48:55,447
Who's the girl?

665
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:58,450
She's a girl from the fair
who wants to be an actress.

666
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,452
What a creep.

667
00:49:00,452 --> 00:49:03,455
What this is about is a big country,
the United States...

668
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:06,458
...making war on a little country.

669
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:10,462
In the US government's view,
which I'm not in any way endorsing...

670
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:12,464
...the US policy is<i>...</i>

671
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:15,467
Maybe this will help. Take these ants.

672
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:18,470
In the US view, a small group,
or cadre, of fierce red ants...

673
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,463
...have taken power and are oppressing
the black ant majority.

674
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:25,477
The stated US policy
is to aid those black ants...

675
00:49:25,477 --> 00:49:28,480
...opposing the red ants,
in hopes of restoring democracy...

676
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,473
...and to stop the red ants from assisting
comrades in neighboring ant colonies.

677
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:37,478
That is the clearest and most disgusting
description of US policy I've ever heard.

678
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:42,494
The Third World is just a lot of ants to you.

679
00:49:42,494 --> 00:49:44,496
Those are people dying, not ants!

680
00:49:44,496 --> 00:49:47,499
You don't understand.
I was reducing everything to ant scale.

681
00:49:47,499 --> 00:49:50,502
The US included. An ant White House...

682
00:49:50,502 --> 00:49:52,504
...an ant CIA, an ant Congress,
an ant Pentagon.

683
00:49:52,504 --> 00:49:56,508
Secret ant landing strips...

684
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:58,510
...illegally established on foreign soil.

685
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:02,503
- Where are the red ants?
- There.

686
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:15,527
- That was terrible.
- You're blowing it way out of proportion.

687
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:18,530
Those red ants were bad news.
They weren't good for anybody.

688
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,533
I was trying to convince them
to look at Americans in a new way.

689
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:24,536
Then, in one stupid move,
you confirm their worst assumptions.

690
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:28,540
I didn't confirm them,
I am their worst assumption.

691
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,544
- Now Ramon is certain you are CIA.
- '<i>'</i>Where are the red ants? '<i>'</i>

692
00:50:32,544 --> 00:50:35,547
It was a joke!

693
00:50:35,547 --> 00:50:39,540
I won't apologize.
The little bastards got what they deserved.

694
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:56,557
<i>Montserrat decided to ride back</i>
<i>with Ramon to pick up her things.</i>

695
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:08,569
Thanks.

696
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:01,622
<i>Montserrat called at 8:00 the next morning,</i>
<i>but I'd already left for the office.</i>

697
00:52:06,638 --> 00:52:10,642
Losing a sale doesn't bother me so much.
I'll make other sales.

698
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:14,646
But there's this thought I can't shake
that's getting me down.

699
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:18,650
Maybe I'm not cut out for sales.
I thought I liked sales and was good at it.

700
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,652
But maybe I'm not cut out for it.

701
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:22,654
What exactly is the problem?

702
00:52:22,654 --> 00:52:25,657
Spending your whole life
doing something you're ill-suited to.

703
00:52:25,657 --> 00:52:26,658
Wasting your life.

704
00:52:26,658 --> 00:52:29,661
It's kind of depressing.

705
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:32,664
God. Maybe I'm not cut out for the Navy.

706
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:34,666
I gotta get back.

707
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:38,670
Back to work? For someone not cut out
for something, you're pretty obsessed.

708
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,672
That doesn't mean anything.

709
00:52:40,672 --> 00:52:44,665
- It's okay if I stay another night?
- Sure.

710
00:52:50,682 --> 00:52:54,675
<i>The call from Chicago I'd been dreading,</i>
<i>came that evening.</i>

711
00:52:57,689 --> 00:52:59,691
Okay.

712
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,693
Good-bye.

713
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,695
That was Dickie.

714
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:06,698
He's coming here to speak with me
but won't say what it's about.

715
00:53:06,698 --> 00:53:08,700
I'm getting canned.

716
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,703
<i>Ramon's article appeared the next day.</i>

717
00:53:11,703 --> 00:53:12,704
It's incredible.

718
00:53:12,704 --> 00:53:15,707
The most disgusting slander.

719
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,710
'<i>'</i>Americans themselves
suspected in USO bombing.'<i>'</i>

720
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,713
Where do they get this about us
blowing up the <i>Maine</i>?

721
00:53:21,713 --> 00:53:25,706
I'm going to the Consul.
They've gotta reply to this.

722
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,724
God! I can't believe it!

723
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:33,725
What?

724
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:36,728
You're not going to believe this.
The Consul.

725
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:40,732
That half-bottle of Old Crow.
He accused me of stealing it.

726
00:53:40,732 --> 00:53:42,734
- He gave you that.
- I thought so.

727
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:45,737
He was on the phone, and I went like this:

728
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:47,739
I'm sure he indicated it was okay.

729
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:48,740
You replaced it.

730
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,733
You can't find Old Crow here, so I got
a bottle of Jim Beam, which costs more.

731
00:53:53,745 --> 00:53:55,747
- The bottle in the kitchen?
- Yeah.

732
00:53:55,747 --> 00:53:57,749
You've been drinking that.

733
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:01,742
I won't replace a half-bottle of Old Crow
with a full Jim Beam. I'm not an idiot.

734
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:05,757
You haven't replaced it?
Don't you see how bad that looks.

735
00:54:05,757 --> 00:54:07,759
Oh, God, give me a break!

736
00:54:07,759 --> 00:54:11,763
After a while, the line between
borrowing things and theft...

737
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:13,765
...becomes awfully thin.

738
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:15,767
Take that back.

739
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:19,771
Until you retract that,
I'm not going to say another word to you.

740
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:21,773
Okay.

741
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:25,766
What you're referring to happened
20 years ago and not as you imply.

742
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:29,781
Your kayak was a death ship!
I almost went down in it.

743
00:54:29,781 --> 00:54:32,784
Thank God it was me, not you.
I was a stronger swimmer.

744
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:34,786
I probably saved your life.

745
00:54:34,786 --> 00:54:37,789
Great. It wasn't only the kayak.

746
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:40,792
You're obsessed
with material possessions!

747
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,794
Maybe the Spanish are right.

748
00:54:42,794 --> 00:54:45,797
This American materialism is terrible.

749
00:54:45,797 --> 00:54:47,799
You're just like the Consul.

750
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:49,801
More interested in possessions...

751
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,804
...than in answering the most hideously
false and disgusting libel.

752
00:54:52,804 --> 00:54:55,807
- Were you like this at the consulate?
- What's the Consul doing? Nothing.

753
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:58,810
He doesn't want to jeopardize
his relationship with the press.

754
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,814
You gotta be more careful.
You can't go mouthing off this way.

755
00:55:02,814 --> 00:55:04,816
- Mouthing off?
- Yeah.

756
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:06,818
These are vile lies.

757
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:09,821
We know how disgusting they are.
But, nobody here does.

758
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:12,824
- We've gotta reply to this.
- We?

759
00:55:12,824 --> 00:55:16,828
I drafted a brief letter for your signature.

760
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:19,831
I can't say,
'<i>'</i>The article made me want to vomit.'<i>'</i>

761
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:23,824
Maybe that's not a good way to open.
I could put it at the end.

762
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:28,829
What are these tiny,
red dots on your papers?

763
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:47,859
<i>Digui?</i> He's not here.

764
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:51,852
I just got in. Apparently he isn't home yet.

765
00:55:52,864 --> 00:55:56,868
No, he didn't say anything.

766
00:55:56,868 --> 00:56:00,861
Okay, I'll give him the message.

767
00:56:05,877 --> 00:56:07,879
That was Montserrat.

768
00:56:07,879 --> 00:56:09,881
What's going on there?

769
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:12,884
- Ted has not said anything?
- No.

770
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,886
He has been in a weird funk.

771
00:56:14,886 --> 00:56:17,889
- It is all his fault.
- Really?

772
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:21,882
Watch. I am taking one 5,000 peseta note.
You're my witness.

773
00:56:22,894 --> 00:56:25,897
And I'm leaving my signed,
personal IOU for that amount...

774
00:56:25,897 --> 00:56:29,901
...to be repaid within 24<i>...</i>

775
00:56:29,901 --> 00:56:33,894
Well, 72 hours.

776
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:36,908
Yes, it is true.

777
00:56:36,908 --> 00:56:38,910
It's actually better this way.

778
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,914
He'd have lent it to me,
but this spares us the acrimony.

779
00:56:42,914 --> 00:56:44,916
Do you mind waiting?
I'll just be a few minutes.

780
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:48,909
No.

781
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:54,926
<i>Ramon is very smart.</i>

782
00:56:54,926 --> 00:56:58,930
That evening, on by one, he broke down
all her reasons for leaving him.

783
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,934
First, he's returned to writing
for the paper's international section.

784
00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:04,936
I know. Great.

785
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:08,940
He pointed up that no matter how well
she and Ted were in Barcelona...

786
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,944
...at some point Ted will return to Chicago,
to him the most beautiful city in the world.

787
00:57:12,944 --> 00:57:15,947
That's crazy. San Francisco is.

788
00:57:15,947 --> 00:57:16,948
Ramon is very persuasive.

789
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:20,952
He painted a terrible picture of what
it would be like for her to live...

790
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:23,955
...her life in America
with its crime, consumerism and vulgarity.

791
00:57:23,955 --> 00:57:26,958
All those loud, badly-dressed fat people...

792
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,961
...watching their 80 channels of TV
and visiting shopping malls.

793
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:33,965
The plastic, throw-everything-away
society with its violence and racism.

794
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:37,969
And finally, the total lack of culture.

795
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:38,970
It's a problem.

796
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,974
Ramon's very clever because he never said
anything opposing Ted directly.

797
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:45,977
He didn't even mention
that thing about the ants.

798
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:49,970
He pointed out how Montserrat would be
separating from family and friends forever.

799
00:57:50,982 --> 00:57:52,984
Even if she came back every year...

800
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:55,987
...her children would be Americans,
eating hamburgers.

801
00:57:55,987 --> 00:57:59,991
Finally, Montserrat was sobbing,
what he described was so bleak.

802
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:03,984
She's dumped Ted and gone back
to Ramon because of some conversation?

803
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:10,001
That's just it. She just wanted
to have a serious talk with Ted...

804
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:14,005
...but the way he acted
practically forced her into Ramon's arms.

805
00:58:14,005 --> 00:58:16,007
She is in the arms of Ramon?

806
00:58:16,007 --> 00:58:18,009
No.

807
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:19,010
I don't know.

808
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:23,003
When you were in Rhode Island,
was the crime and vulgarity so bad?

809
00:58:25,016 --> 00:58:29,009
Great.

810
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:40,031
- What's going on?
- I'm getting canned.

811
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:43,034
But you're the best they've got.
You always say so.

812
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:47,038
I know. This jerk Dickie Taylor
is calling the shots now.

813
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:49,040
I don't know how Jack let it happen.

814
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,043
God!

815
00:58:52,043 --> 00:58:54,045
And on top of that thing with Montserrat.

816
00:58:54,045 --> 00:58:56,047
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

817
00:58:56,047 --> 00:59:00,051
Marta said you practically forced her
back into Ramon's arms.

818
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:02,053
She said that?

819
00:59:02,053 --> 00:59:05,056
I don't know what happened.
Everything was going so well.

820
00:59:05,056 --> 00:59:09,060
Then she never showed up that night
after going for her things at Ramon's.

821
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,053
They talked until dawn
and she slept on his sofa...

822
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:16,067
...which, for all I know, is true.

823
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:20,071
Marta said he laid it on thick with
the violence and racism in the USA.

824
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:24,075
It wouldn't change everything this way.
Something spooked her.

825
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:28,079
As if I had crowded her.
I was really playing it cool, too.

826
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,081
What makes you think that?

827
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:33,084
Now she doesn't want to move in.
She wants a serious talk.

828
00:59:33,084 --> 00:59:36,087
- You know what that means.
- You should talk with her.

829
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:38,089
No. That would be a disaster.

830
00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:42,093
I'd be the jerk crowding her,
whom she had to talk to seriously.

831
00:59:42,093 --> 00:59:44,095
But saying you have a work emergency?

832
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:46,097
I do.

833
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:50,101
- And you're too busy to see her.
- Have you ever heard of Maneuver X?

834
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:53,104
When you get deeply into sales,
you realize that...

835
00:59:53,104 --> 00:59:57,097
...every major transaction involves
a mini identity crisis for the buyer.

836
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:02,113
You think, '<i>'</i>A green carpet.
Am I really a green carpet person? '<i>'</i>

837
01:00:02,113 --> 01:00:06,117
In romance, the same thing applies
but on a humongous scale.

838
01:00:06,117 --> 01:00:07,118
But what is Maneuver X?

839
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:10,121
It's removing all pressure.

840
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:14,125
Creating a space that the customer
has to affirmatively cross.

841
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:18,129
Only by disappearing more thoroughly
and inexplicably than Montserrat...

842
01:00:18,129 --> 01:00:20,131
...can I change the current dynamic.

843
01:00:20,131 --> 01:00:23,134
Will it? I don't know. I think it will.

844
01:00:23,134 --> 01:00:27,138
If not, I'm dead.

845
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:31,142
You've thought this through.
That's impressive.

846
01:00:31,142 --> 01:00:34,145
I haven't thought through anything
about Marta.

847
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:38,138
But isn't Maneuver X just another way
of playing hard to get?

848
01:00:40,151 --> 01:00:44,144
No.

849
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:56,167
I'm being followed.

850
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:59,170
- Give me a break.
- There is a guy following me.

851
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:03,163
Come here, I'll show you.

852
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:07,178
Not there. He'll see you. Over here.

853
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:10,181
Edge your eyes around.

854
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:13,184
He's on that pedestrian island,
a little further down.

855
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:15,186
He's in the car?

856
01:01:15,186 --> 01:01:17,188
What car?

857
01:01:17,188 --> 01:01:20,191
No. He's gone.

858
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:22,193
There really was a guy.

859
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:24,195
Wherever I went, he went.

860
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:28,199
- What did he look like?
- Sort of suspicious-looking.

861
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:31,202
- What was he wearing?
- He was carrying something.

862
01:01:31,202 --> 01:01:35,195
A camera, I think.

863
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:41,201
The words to pop songs are about the only
literature of advice we have on romance.

864
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:44,215
Most of the advice, very bad.

865
01:01:44,215 --> 01:01:46,217
Clarify something for me.

866
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:49,220
Since I've been waiting for the fleet,
I've read a lot.

867
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,222
Really?

868
01:01:51,222 --> 01:01:54,225
One thing that keeps
cropping up is '<i>'</i>subtext.'<i>'</i>

869
01:01:54,225 --> 01:01:57,228
Plays, novels, songs, all have a subtext...

870
01:01:57,228 --> 01:02:00,231
...which I take to mean
a hidden message or import of some kind.

871
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:04,224
Subtext, we know. But what do you call
the message or meaning...

872
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:09,240
...that's on the surface, open and obvious?
They never talk about that.

873
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,233
What do you call
what's above the subtext?

874
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:17,248
The text.

875
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:21,241
That's right, but they never talk about that.

876
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:29,260
Jesus!

877
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:33,264
The anti-Americanism here is incredible!

878
01:02:33,264 --> 01:02:35,266
Oh, my God!

879
01:02:35,266 --> 01:02:36,267
Jesus!

880
01:02:36,267 --> 01:02:39,270
'<i>'</i>CIA Network Discovered in Barcelona.

881
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,272
'<i>'</i>Operations Run by Fred Boynton.'<i>'</i>

882
01:02:41,272 --> 01:02:45,265
How can they print this stuff?

883
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:04,284
Finally.

884
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:09,300
God, incredible.

885
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,302
That was horrible. Blame the victim.

886
01:03:11,302 --> 01:03:15,306
There was even a call
from the Pentagon, furious.

887
01:03:15,306 --> 01:03:19,299
This is the worst day of my life.
God, that Consul's annoying!

888
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:24,315
That white car's following us.

889
01:03:24,315 --> 01:03:26,317
- Which car? They're all white.
- The Renault.

890
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:28,319
- They're all Renaults.
- Cut it out.

891
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,323
The white Renault's following me. The last
thing I need is more press coverage.

892
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:36,316
It's got Gerona plates.

893
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:51,342
Why do you always go to bathrooms
with other people?

894
01:03:51,342 --> 01:03:53,344
I wasn't born yesterday.

895
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:56,347
You were not born yesterday?

896
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:59,350
I don't understand you.

897
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:02,353
You're not in a very nice mood.

898
01:04:02,353 --> 01:04:05,356
You gave Ramon that information.

899
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:07,358
I didn't know it was of significance.

900
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,361
Couldn't you tell I was joking?
I'm not in the CIA.

901
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:14,354
- It was obviously a joke.
- I have no idea what you are.

902
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:19,370
You promised not to repeat to Montserrat
what I said about Ted.

903
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,372
That he wants to marry her?

904
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:25,376
I had to tell her. She already
suspected something like that.

905
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:29,380
She was worried about getting
involved with an extremist.

906
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,382
Extremist?

907
01:04:31,382 --> 01:04:35,375
It's fascist for a boy to immediately talk
of marrying a woman he likes.

908
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:40,380
I don't think Ted is a fascist
of the marrying kind.

909
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:45,396
You're right. Something did spook her.
Apparently...

910
01:04:45,396 --> 01:04:49,389
...I told Marta you wanted to marry
and spend your life with her.

911
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:52,403
I never even told you.

912
01:04:52,403 --> 01:04:56,396
You never confide anything in me,
so I have to extrapolate.

913
01:04:58,409 --> 01:05:02,413
Why did you tell her?

914
01:05:02,413 --> 01:05:04,415
You're in this conversation.
It has momentum.

915
01:05:04,415 --> 01:05:07,418
You want to tell interesting
or funny things.

916
01:05:07,418 --> 01:05:11,422
You end up telling things,
maybe you shouldn't.

917
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:14,425
This was just some '<i>'</i>funny thing.'<i>'</i>

918
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:17,428
I'd take it back if I could.

919
01:05:17,428 --> 01:05:21,432
Montserrat's gone to Paris to take
the summer program at the Institute.

920
01:05:21,432 --> 01:05:25,436
I'm sorry.

921
01:05:25,436 --> 01:05:29,440
I don't know if this is the right time
to mention this.

922
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,443
I'm sure it isn't, but...

923
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:36,436
...I think I might be in love
with Montserrat, too.

924
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:41,441
What if you aren't perfect for each other,
but we are?

925
01:05:42,453 --> 01:05:44,455
Am I supposed to give up
any possibility of happiness?

926
01:05:44,455 --> 01:05:48,459
Of ever knowing if she was the one person
I was meant to be with...

927
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:50,461
...because accidentally you met her first?

928
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:54,465
I hate your guts.

929
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:57,468
I know.

930
01:05:57,468 --> 01:06:01,461
I'll never mention this again.

931
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:10,481
I'm going to Milan this morning
and up to Paris on Monday.

932
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:13,484
There's some IHSMOCO business there.

933
01:06:13,484 --> 01:06:15,486
You'll call Montserrat before you go?

934
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:18,489
I think I'll just call when I get there.
Play it cool.

935
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:22,493
- You're keeping on with Maneuver X?
- Yeah.

936
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:25,496
A modified X.

937
01:06:25,496 --> 01:06:29,500
I borrowed 5,000 pesetas.
Is it okay if I pay you back later?

938
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,504
You have a bad habit of borrowing things
without informing the lender.

939
01:06:33,504 --> 01:06:34,505
Sorry.

940
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:38,509
'<i>'</i>I owe you 5,000 pesetas
to be repaid within 24...

941
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:42,502
'<i>'...</i>72 hours. F.'<i>'</i>

942
01:06:43,514 --> 01:06:47,507
- You crossed over into real larceny.
- What?

943
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:52,523
I didn't take it.

944
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:55,526
I took one 5,000 peseta note.
The rest was all here.

945
01:06:55,526 --> 01:06:58,529
I don't care. That's enough.

946
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:01,532
You can't think I would really steal?

947
01:07:01,532 --> 01:07:05,525
How does it look?

948
01:07:15,546 --> 01:07:19,539
Bitch.

949
01:07:26,557 --> 01:07:30,561
I will either get your money back
or I will pay you back myself.

950
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:33,564
Good.

951
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:37,557
Jesus!

952
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:46,577
I don't steal. I didn't take your money.

953
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:50,570
You've always been so self-righteous,
ever since we were 10. It's unbearable.

954
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:55,575
What happened when we were 10?
You're such a liar.

955
01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:35,686
Every day, in every way,
I am becoming a better lieutenant.

956
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:39,679
Every day, in every way,
I am becoming a better lieutenant.

957
01:11:14,785 --> 01:11:17,788
<i>Even disasters that strike</i>
<i>those we are closest to...</i>

958
01:11:17,788 --> 01:11:21,792
<i>... only reach us filtered through</i>
<i>our own colossal egotism.</i>

959
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:25,785
<i>My response was swamped</i>
<i>in subjective emotion, mostly guilt.</i>

960
01:11:26,797 --> 01:11:30,801
<i>I prayed all the time, but with</i>
<i>the constant doubt I was kidding myself.</i>

961
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:34,794
<i>I suspected my religious faith</i>
<i>was largely bogus.</i>

962
01:11:35,806 --> 01:11:38,809
<i>I resolved to stay all the time</i>
<i>and do whatever I could...</i>

963
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:42,802
<i>... to improve Fred's chances for recovery.</i>

964
01:11:45,816 --> 01:11:48,819
<i>Fred was shot before</i>
<i>one of the long summer weekends.</i>

965
01:11:48,819 --> 01:11:52,812
<i>By late Friday, the entire senior</i>
<i>medical staff seemed to have disappeared.</i>

966
01:11:55,826 --> 01:11:58,829
I can't believe you're just going?
There must be more you can do.

967
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:02,822
Don't worry.
Your buddy will get the best medicine care.

968
01:12:05,836 --> 01:12:09,840
<i>"Don't worry" is the most</i>
<i>frightening phrase in English.</i>

969
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,833
<i>"Don'd gworry," even more so.</i>

970
01:12:16,847 --> 01:12:20,840
<i>It means they're not going to worry,</i>
<i>but you better had.</i>

971
01:12:33,864 --> 01:12:37,857
<i>Each hour Fred remained unconscious,</i>
<i>his chances got worse.</i>

972
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,872
<i>I had heard that sounds</i>
<i>of familiar voices might help.</i>

973
01:12:41,872 --> 01:12:45,876
<i>So I kept up a steady stream of chatter</i>
<i>in Fred's room.</i>

974
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:48,879
<i>And arranged an around-the-clock vigil</i>
<i>of friends to read to him.</i>

975
01:12:48,879 --> 01:12:51,882
<i>It was hard to find books in English,</i>
<i>Fred might like.</i>

976
01:12:51,882 --> 01:12:55,886
'<i>'</i>We seek him here, we seek him there.
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.

977
01:12:55,886 --> 01:12:59,879
'<i>'</i>ls he in heaven? Is he in hell?
That damned, elusive Pimpernel? '<i>'</i>

978
01:13:00,891 --> 01:13:04,884
<i>It was disillusioning how some people</i>
<i>let you down when someone gets sick.</i>

979
01:13:05,896 --> 01:13:08,899
It's 9:30, the situation's really bad.

980
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:12,892
Why haven't you shown up yet?
You're really needed here.

981
01:13:14,905 --> 01:13:18,898
<i>Aurora turned out to be a real trooper.</i>

982
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:23,903
<i>Marta never showed up.</i>

983
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,918
<i>The Consul turned out to be a great guy.</i>

984
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:29,920
<i>Terrific with the hospital administration.</i>

985
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,923
<i>He couldn't believe Fred had taken</i>
<i>the Old Crow thing seriously.</i>

986
01:13:32,923 --> 01:13:34,925
I was just kidding.

987
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:37,928
I forgot guys who joke around a lot
can be so sensitive.

988
01:13:37,928 --> 01:13:41,932
I have no sense of humor
so he must have assumed I was serious.

989
01:13:41,932 --> 01:13:44,935
<i>Among the Navy guards was</i>
<i>our friend, Frank...</i>

990
01:13:44,935 --> 01:13:47,938
<i>... who, in his off-duty hours,</i>
<i>helped me with the reading.</i>

991
01:13:47,938 --> 01:13:51,942
'<i>'</i>'Wherever you are, depravity and evil
are to be found,' said Pierre to his wife.

992
01:13:51,942 --> 01:13:55,935
'<i>'</i>'Anatole, come with me. I want
a word with you,' he added in French.'<i>'</i>

993
01:13:56,947 --> 01:13:59,950
<i>Fred and I were so-called "only cousins"...</i>

994
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,953
<i>... the only cousin each of us had.</i>

995
01:14:02,953 --> 01:14:05,956
<i>We didn't hate each other</i>
<i>our whole childhood.</i>

996
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:09,949
<i>The summer we were 10,</i>
<i>for 36 hours we were on quite good terms.</i>

997
01:14:10,961 --> 01:14:12,963
<i>After we cut ourselves</i>
<i>in a fishing accident...</i>

998
01:14:12,963 --> 01:14:16,956
<i>... we used all the blood</i>
<i>to become "blood brothers."</i>

999
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:22,973
<i>Later, I went into town with my parents.</i>

1000
01:14:22,973 --> 01:14:26,966
<i>I never saw my kayak again.</i>

1001
01:14:40,991 --> 01:14:41,992
<i>I was expecting Aurora.</i>

1002
01:14:41,992 --> 01:14:45,985
<i>But the nurse said</i>
<i>another woman wanted to speak with me.</i>

1003
01:15:01,011 --> 01:15:05,004
You got my messages.

1004
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:16,026
We'll go out.
You probably want to be alone with him.

1005
01:15:16,026 --> 01:15:19,029
No. Actually I'm here to see you.

1006
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:21,031
- Is it about Fred?
- No.

1007
01:15:21,031 --> 01:15:22,032
I'll walk you out.

1008
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:25,035
You should go home, go to sleep.
You look so tired.

1009
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:27,037
Greta and I can stay.

1010
01:15:27,037 --> 01:15:29,039
Greta has good English
and loves this book.

1011
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:33,043
Okay. Thanks.
There's still hope, you know.

1012
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:34,044
More than hope.

1013
01:15:34,044 --> 01:15:38,048
He could come out of it any time
and be okay with little consequences.

1014
01:15:38,048 --> 01:15:40,050
Or very few.

1015
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:44,043
- Good-bye.
- <i>Adéu.</i>

1016
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:51,050
'<i>'</i>That man is somehow<i>...</i>

1017
01:15:56,066 --> 01:16:00,070
'<i>'</i>'That man is somehow closely
and painfully connected with me'...

1018
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:02,072
'<i>'...</i>thought Prince Andre.

1019
01:16:02,072 --> 01:16:04,074
'<i>'</i>Suddenly he remembered Natasha...

1020
01:16:04,074 --> 01:16:07,077
'<i>'...</i>as he'd first seen her
at the ball in 1810...

1021
01:16:07,077 --> 01:16:10,080
'<i>'...</i>with her slender neck and arms...

1022
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,073
'<i>'...</i>with her timid, happy face
prepared for ecstasy.'<i>'</i>

1023
01:16:15,085 --> 01:16:17,087
Fifteen minutes don't go by
that I don't think of her.

1024
01:16:17,087 --> 01:16:21,080
- I think about her all the time.
- Too bad. I thought you'd gotten over her.

1025
01:16:22,092 --> 01:16:23,093
What do you mean?

1026
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:26,096
It was impossible. You had no chance.

1027
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:30,100
- Why do you say that?
- It is only my opinion.

1028
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,104
When Fred was shot,
did he have envelopes of cash with him?

1029
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:36,106
Yes.

1030
01:16:36,106 --> 01:16:39,109
That money's mine and I need it back.

1031
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:40,110
What?

1032
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:43,113
I need that money back.
I'm going on a journey.

1033
01:16:43,113 --> 01:16:47,117
That money was taken from me.
Fred was just recovering it.

1034
01:16:47,117 --> 01:16:50,120
You suspect me of having taken
that money?

1035
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,122
You didn't take it?

1036
01:16:52,122 --> 01:16:56,126
I did. But it was only 300,000 pesetas.

1037
01:16:56,126 --> 01:16:58,128
Fred took more than those.

1038
01:16:58,128 --> 01:17:01,131
- What do you want?
- I want the money that belongs to me.

1039
01:17:01,131 --> 01:17:05,135
- How much?
- 200,000 pesetas.

1040
01:17:05,135 --> 01:17:08,138
I need that money. I'm going away.

1041
01:17:08,138 --> 01:17:11,141
- Where?
- The Maldive Islands.

1042
01:17:11,141 --> 01:17:12,142
The Maldives?

1043
01:17:12,142 --> 01:17:16,135
I've decided to change my life completely.
But I need that money.

1044
01:17:17,147 --> 01:17:20,150
From now on,
I want to lead an exemplary life.

1045
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,153
Exemplary? What about Fred?

1046
01:17:23,153 --> 01:17:24,154
Fred shall not want to see me.

1047
01:17:24,154 --> 01:17:28,158
Something shameful happened.
He did not tell you?

1048
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,151
The one Fred truly liked was Montserrat,
though he would never tell you.

1049
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:06,196
<i>Fred had gone into convulsions</i>
<i>while Aurora's friend was with him.</i>

1050
01:18:06,196 --> 01:18:10,189
It's not your fault. You did
everything right. It's good you were there.

1051
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:21,211
Can you hear anything?

1052
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:24,214
If you can pull through this
you can rest at the lake.

1053
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:28,207
Try to think about the lake.

1054
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:35,225
Do you mind?
I feel awkward with someone looking on.

1055
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:36,226
What?

1056
01:18:36,226 --> 01:18:39,229
I was going to say something
and it's awkward.

1057
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:43,222
- It will only be 5 or 10 minutes.
- I am sorry.

1058
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:54,233
You know some Catholic prayer?

1059
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:08,258
Are you the boy who wanted
to marry Montserrat?

1060
01:19:08,258 --> 01:19:10,260
No.

1061
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,262
- Who told you that?
- What?

1062
01:19:12,262 --> 01:19:14,264
That I wanted to marry Montserrat.

1063
01:19:14,264 --> 01:19:18,268
It was just the story of an American boy
who fell in love with Montserrat...

1064
01:19:18,268 --> 01:19:20,270
...decided he wanted to marry
and spend his life with her...

1065
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:24,263
...while they danced to a Bee Gees song.

1066
01:19:27,277 --> 01:19:31,281
- Is he the boy in love with Montserrat?
- No.

1067
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:35,285
- I don't think so.
- Montserrat does know you.

1068
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:39,289
She called here after you left
and asked about both of you.

1069
01:19:39,289 --> 01:19:41,291
What did she say?

1070
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:45,284
I don't know. Aurora took the call.

1071
01:19:54,304 --> 01:19:57,307
Why weren't you in the article on the most
beautiful women at the Trade Fair?

1072
01:19:57,307 --> 01:20:01,311
- You thought I should be?
- You should.

1073
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:04,314
- I loathe that fellow. You know him?
- We've met.

1074
01:20:04,314 --> 01:20:08,318
That's interesting, you loathe him.
How come?

1075
01:20:08,318 --> 01:20:12,322
I don't have the English.
In Castilian, we'd say he's <i>repelente.</i>

1076
01:20:12,322 --> 01:20:15,325
Repellant. That's good.

1077
01:20:15,325 --> 01:20:17,327
- What's your name?
- Greta.

1078
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:20,330
- That's not very Catalan.
- I'm not very Catalan.

1079
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:24,323
Who's this?

1080
01:20:26,336 --> 01:20:28,338
- Are you religious?
- <i>Quasi.</i>

1081
01:20:28,338 --> 01:20:32,331
- You want to be an artist?
- No.

1082
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:37,347
Listen, you should get some rest.

1083
01:20:37,347 --> 01:20:40,350
You think I should go?

1084
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:44,343
I could stay longer if you like.
Until Aurora comes.

1085
01:20:45,355 --> 01:20:49,348
Actually I was thinking of sacking out here.

1086
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,362
'<i>'</i>Sacking out? '<i>'</i>

1087
01:20:52,362 --> 01:20:56,355
Sleeping here on the chairs, maybe.

1088
01:21:01,371 --> 01:21:04,374
Do you think he will become well?

1089
01:21:04,374 --> 01:21:08,378
- Are you convinced of that?
- Yes.

1090
01:21:08,378 --> 01:21:11,381
It was great you were here last night.

1091
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:15,374
Thanks for staying.

1092
01:21:38,408 --> 01:21:42,412
I'm sorry I didn't come so soon.
I only heard yesterday.

1093
01:21:42,412 --> 01:21:45,415
- You only heard yesterday?
- Is he any better?

1094
01:21:45,415 --> 01:21:47,417
No.

1095
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:50,420
Not yet.

1096
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,422
Fred was right.

1097
01:21:52,422 --> 01:21:55,425
I persecuted him for trivialities.

1098
01:21:55,425 --> 01:21:58,428
There were things that I blew way out
of proportion.

1099
01:21:58,428 --> 01:22:02,421
Things that seemed crimes at the time,
but were really of no importance.

1100
01:22:04,434 --> 01:22:07,437
Maybe he did save my life
going down in the kayak that way.

1101
01:22:07,437 --> 01:22:10,440
Those Board scores,
that couldn't have been right.

1102
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,444
Before, I always thought
Fred was smarter than I was.

1103
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:16,446
Maybe not smarter, but<i>...</i>

1104
01:22:16,446 --> 01:22:19,449
Maybe his explanation was true.

1105
01:22:19,449 --> 01:22:23,453
Fred said that when he took his Boards,
this annoying girl sat next to him...

1106
01:22:23,453 --> 01:22:26,456
...who kept fiddling with her brassiere.

1107
01:22:26,456 --> 01:22:30,460
Fred went to an all-boys school
and her fidgeting was so distracting...

1108
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,462
...he lost his place on the answer sheet.

1109
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:36,455
- You thought that was not true?
- I always assumed it was false.

1110
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:41,471
No. That's the way it's been.

1111
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:45,464
He moves and you think
he's come out of it.

1112
01:22:48,478 --> 01:22:50,480
Should we go somewhere to talk?

1113
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,473
Until he comes out of this,
I resolved not to think of anything else.

1114
01:22:55,485 --> 01:22:57,487
Maybe when Aurora comes.

1115
01:22:57,487 --> 01:23:01,480
We came together.
They're in the cafeteria. I'll get them.

1116
01:23:03,493 --> 01:23:07,486
I'll stay here with Fred.

1117
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,504
'<i>'</i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
please forgive us our sins.'<i>'</i>

1118
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:16,506
Please bring Fred back
to full consciousness...

1119
01:23:16,506 --> 01:23:20,499
...with his mental capabilities
and everything reasonably intact.

1120
01:23:21,511 --> 01:23:24,514
Please forgive my doubting,
vainglory, and...

1121
01:23:24,514 --> 01:23:28,507
Give me a break.

1122
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:33,512
Doctor!

1123
01:23:37,527 --> 01:23:41,520
How much can you remember?

1124
01:23:44,534 --> 01:23:47,537
Do you remember who I am?

1125
01:23:47,537 --> 01:23:49,539
- Do you remember who I am?
- Yes!

1126
01:23:49,539 --> 01:23:51,541
Who am I?

1127
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:54,544
Some civilian.

1128
01:23:54,544 --> 01:23:56,546
Who am I?

1129
01:23:56,546 --> 01:24:00,539
The kid with the kayak,
but older and fatter. Leave me alone!

1130
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:05,555
This is terrific.
He's going to have a complete recovery.

1131
01:24:05,555 --> 01:24:07,557
It's amazing. This is really good.

1132
01:24:07,557 --> 01:24:10,560
It looks like his recovery will be complete,
wouldn't you say?

1133
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,563
- Yes. His memory...
- But over the long term?

1134
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:15,565
Yes. Over the long term.

1135
01:24:15,565 --> 01:24:17,567
It looks like his recovery will be complete.

1136
01:24:17,567 --> 01:24:21,560
Yes.

1137
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:36,586
Damn.

1138
01:24:36,586 --> 01:24:38,588
You fell asleep.

1139
01:24:38,588 --> 01:24:41,591
Typical of this guy to make me meet him
at the airport.

1140
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:42,592
Who?

1141
01:24:42,592 --> 01:24:44,594
Dickie Taylor.
The terrible guy from marketing...

1142
01:24:44,594 --> 01:24:48,598
...is making me race off to the airport
to get fired.

1143
01:24:48,598 --> 01:24:50,600
I can't believe that. They're crazy.

1144
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,604
I don't know.
I've been having all these doubts.

1145
01:24:54,604 --> 01:24:58,597
Can you stay at the hospital
with Fred until I get back?

1146
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:14,613
I'm sorry to set it up this way,
but the only connecting flight is at 11:00.

1147
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:22,632
I should get to what I'm here for.
I have some really bad news.

1148
01:25:22,632 --> 01:25:25,635
It is bad news.

1149
01:25:25,635 --> 01:25:27,637
I thought so.

1150
01:25:27,637 --> 01:25:31,641
Dickie, let's make this a lot easier. I quit.

1151
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:35,634
I don't understand why Jack
couldn't call me himself. It's not right.

1152
01:25:36,646 --> 01:25:39,649
What are you talking about?
Jack's sick. He's going to die.

1153
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:41,651
- What?
- Jack's sick.

1154
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:44,654
I can't believe it.

1155
01:25:44,654 --> 01:25:47,657
The whole company's devastated.
Jack's the last of the greats.

1156
01:25:47,657 --> 01:25:49,659
- He's such a great guy.
- He is.

1157
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:53,663
I admit I resented the favoritism
he showed you.

1158
01:25:53,663 --> 01:25:55,665
There was no favoritism.

1159
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:57,667
Come on.

1160
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,669
Anyway, Jack's very worried
about the company.

1161
01:25:59,669 --> 01:26:03,673
Dwight and Ron are older, Tom and Greg
are gone with nobody to succeed them.

1162
01:26:03,673 --> 01:26:06,676
Jack asked with whom I could work best.
Naturally, I mentioned you.

1163
01:26:06,676 --> 01:26:09,679
In Marketing,
you've given us great feedback.

1164
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,683
It's had a critical dimension,
but you're right. Marketing's no science.

1165
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:16,686
He wants pledges that we'll stay
with the company at least 5 years...

1166
01:26:16,686 --> 01:26:20,690
...and wants you back in Chicago
as soon as possible.

1167
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:21,691
I thought you came to fire me.

1168
01:26:21,691 --> 01:26:25,695
What was all that '<i>'</i>I quit'<i>'</i> stuff about?
For a moment I thought...

1169
01:26:25,695 --> 01:26:28,698
I'm so far behind on the sales targets
you set.

1170
01:26:28,698 --> 01:26:29,699
I didn't set them.

1171
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:30,700
- Jack did.
- What?

1172
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,704
You don't know Jack's theory.
He thinks you aren't cut out for sales.

1173
01:26:34,704 --> 01:26:36,706
That it's not your life's work.

1174
01:26:36,706 --> 01:26:40,710
But if you were behind, you'd struggle
to keep up and ignore the rest.

1175
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:44,714
- Jack doesn't think I'm cut out for sales?
- Not the way someone like Henry is.

1176
01:26:44,714 --> 01:26:48,718
Selling is more than a job
one is cut out or not cut out for.

1177
01:26:48,718 --> 01:26:52,722
It's a whole culture, applying the insights
of Carnegie and Bettger.

1178
01:26:52,722 --> 01:26:54,724
We all like Carnegie and Bettger.

1179
01:26:54,724 --> 01:26:57,727
Sales is the heart of any corporation.
Have you read Drucker?

1180
01:26:57,727 --> 01:27:00,730
I saw that as the cult of management.

1181
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:03,733
No, Drucker's terrific. Read him. Here.

1182
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:06,736
The insight in this book is incredible.

1183
01:27:06,736 --> 01:27:09,739
- I'll get it at Kroch's when I'm back.
- Keep it.

1184
01:27:09,739 --> 01:27:13,732
I've memorized it and it's easier for me
to go to Kroch's when I get back.

1185
01:27:14,744 --> 01:27:18,737
Thanks.

1186
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:25,755
You gotta admit, you're well on your way
to a complete and total recovery.

1187
01:27:25,755 --> 01:27:26,756
It's incredible.

1188
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:30,749
Cut out the '<i>'</i>Pollyanna-Little-Miss-Mary-
Sunshine complete recovery'<i>'</i> crap.

1189
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:35,754
You're almost pathological.
Sometimes, I'd like to wring your neck.

1190
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:40,759
The mood swings are new.

1191
01:27:44,774 --> 01:27:48,778
Rehabilitation is fine for houses.
For people, it's unspeakably boring.

1192
01:27:48,778 --> 01:27:51,781
The whole basis for physical therapy is...

1193
01:27:51,781 --> 01:27:55,774
...doing the same thing
over and over and over again.

1194
01:27:57,787 --> 01:28:00,790
- But it's important.
- Oh, yeah.

1195
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:03,793
Learning how to do things
you used to do much better?

1196
01:28:03,793 --> 01:28:06,796
You really should read Drucker.

1197
01:28:06,796 --> 01:28:08,798
- Think it's applicable to the Navy?
- Yeah.

1198
01:28:08,798 --> 01:28:12,791
And whatever else you do afterwards.

1199
01:28:13,803 --> 01:28:17,796
I started remembering things
about that girl, Marta.

1200
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:23,813
Everything has gone so badly.

1201
01:28:23,813 --> 01:28:27,806
I'm not going to be a cry-baby.

1202
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:32,822
I remember something about a limbo stick.

1203
01:28:32,822 --> 01:28:36,815
There was a limbo stick.

1204
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,843
<i>While I was in Chicago,</i>
<i>Fred used my office...</i>

1205
01:28:53,843 --> 01:28:57,836
<i>... to prepare the</i> Fleet Information Sheet.

1206
01:28:59,849 --> 01:29:03,842
Great. Thanks.

1207
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:07,857
That's really nice. Thanks.

1208
01:29:07,857 --> 01:29:11,850
<i>Barcelona and Chicago never seemed</i>
<i>more beautiful than they did that fall.</i>

1209
01:29:15,865 --> 01:29:17,867
<i>Commuting between them,</i>
<i>I started routing through London...</i>

1210
01:29:17,867 --> 01:29:21,860
<i>... into Chicago directly,</i>
<i>avoiding New York and Madrid entirely.</i>

1211
01:29:23,873 --> 01:29:25,875
<i>Twice I ran into Greta on the London leg.</i>

1212
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,877
<i>Apparently, she was visiting friends.</i>

1213
01:29:27,877 --> 01:29:30,880
<i>It was sad watching Jack's decline.</i>

1214
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,882
<i>But he still had good days</i>
<i>and the memory of these...</i>

1215
01:29:32,882 --> 01:29:35,885
<i>... will always be important to all of us.</i>

1216
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:38,888
<i>In Barcelona,</i>
<i>I had to quickly plan the wedding...</i>

1217
01:29:38,888 --> 01:29:40,890
<i>... and wrap up my IHSMOCO work.</i>

1218
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:43,893
You never said you were getting married?

1219
01:29:43,893 --> 01:29:45,895
<i>Fred's attitude really puzzled me.</i>

1220
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:48,898
<i>Initially, he seemed bitter.</i>

1221
01:29:48,898 --> 01:29:50,900
I've never seen you like this. So cocky.

1222
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,903
Aren't you taking things for granted?
The boyfriend's still around.

1223
01:29:53,903 --> 01:29:56,906
I'm not taking anything for granted
until the vows...

1224
01:29:56,906 --> 01:29:59,909
You think wedding vows will
change everything?

1225
01:29:59,909 --> 01:30:03,913
Your naiveté is astounding.
Didn't you see <i>The Graduate</i>?

1226
01:30:03,913 --> 01:30:06,916
You can remember <i>The Graduate</i>?

1227
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:10,920
I can remember a few things.
Apparently you don't. The end?

1228
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,923
Katharine Ross has just married this cool,
tall, blond...

1229
01:30:13,923 --> 01:30:16,926
...popular guy, the make-out king
of his fraternity.

1230
01:30:16,926 --> 01:30:20,930
This obnoxious Dustin Hoffman character
shows up at the church...

1231
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:24,934
...starts pounding on the glass,
acting like a total asshole.

1232
01:30:24,934 --> 01:30:27,937
'<i>'</i>Elaine! Elaine! '<i>'</i>

1233
01:30:27,937 --> 01:30:31,941
Does Katharine Ross tell Dustin Hoffman,
'<i>'</i>Get lost creep, I'm a married woman'<i>'</i>?

1234
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:32,942
No.

1235
01:30:32,942 --> 01:30:36,946
She runs off with him. On a bus.

1236
01:30:36,946 --> 01:30:38,948
That is the reality.

1237
01:30:38,948 --> 01:30:40,950
Thanks a lot.

1238
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:44,943
<i>Then Fred's tone changed and he became</i>
<i>insanely positive about the wedding.</i>

1239
01:30:45,955 --> 01:30:47,957
Of course I like her. She's great.

1240
01:30:47,957 --> 01:30:51,961
You're right for each other.
It makes sense.

1241
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:54,964
- She's accepted and everything?
- Of course, she's accepted.

1242
01:30:54,964 --> 01:30:58,957
That's great.

1243
01:31:08,978 --> 01:31:11,981
Positive thinking is fine in theory.

1244
01:31:11,981 --> 01:31:15,985
But when I try it on a systematic basis,
I end up really depressed.

1245
01:31:15,985 --> 01:31:18,988
It doesn't work for me, either.

1246
01:31:18,988 --> 01:31:22,992
God.

1247
01:31:22,992 --> 01:31:25,995
- Good.
- You invited that guy?

1248
01:31:25,995 --> 01:31:27,997
He was great when you were
in the hospital. You misjudged him.

1249
01:31:27,997 --> 01:31:31,000
- He seems like a nice guy.
- He's paid to act that way.

1250
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,002
- How are you doing?
- Nice to see you.

1251
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:35,004
- How are you?
- Good morning.

1252
01:31:35,004 --> 01:31:38,997
How are you doing?

1253
01:31:48,017 --> 01:31:52,010
- No one from the bride's side.
- Her parents wanted to keep it small.

1254
01:31:53,022 --> 01:31:56,025
They must be delighted she's marrying
an <i>Estadouni</i>- dense.

1255
01:31:56,025 --> 01:32:00,018
No, they're not that way.
Her family's terrific.

1256
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:15,044
My father wanted me to explain.

1257
01:32:15,044 --> 01:32:19,048
'<i>'</i>Sorry for inconvenience.
Please take coffee, we there be soon.'<i>'</i>

1258
01:32:19,048 --> 01:32:22,051
- Everything's fine with your sister?
- Yes.

1259
01:32:22,051 --> 01:32:24,053
We don't understand where she is,
but, not a problem.

1260
01:32:24,053 --> 01:32:26,055
God!

1261
01:32:26,055 --> 01:32:30,059
Not a problem.
My sister is a very serious girl.

1262
01:32:30,059 --> 01:32:32,061
Do you know that?

1263
01:32:32,061 --> 01:32:33,062
Yes.

1264
01:32:33,062 --> 01:32:37,055
Lets go to the Meson.

1265
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:44,073
Things have been pretty tense.
I've hardly slept in a week.

1266
01:32:44,073 --> 01:32:47,076
Her old boyfriend resurfaced
on Wednesday.

1267
01:32:47,076 --> 01:32:48,077
Not a problem.

1268
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:51,080
I don't think anti-Americanism
is that significant.

1269
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,084
- It's nothing to take personally.
- Sorry if I take it personally.

1270
01:32:55,084 --> 01:32:56,085
What is it, then?

1271
01:32:56,085 --> 01:33:00,089
Let me use an analogy.
The US is like an enormous ant farm.

1272
01:33:00,089 --> 01:33:02,091
God, not ants!

1273
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:06,095
A see-through plastic case
enclosing an ant colony.

1274
01:33:06,095 --> 01:33:10,088
It's a toy sold to children so they can
watch ants build their own society.

1275
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,103
The US is like an ant farm
for the rest of the world.

1276
01:33:14,103 --> 01:33:17,106
But, people living in other countries
can't observe the ants.

1277
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:21,099
They must rely on journalists
and commentators for a description.

1278
01:33:22,111 --> 01:33:26,104
The problem is,
that these people seem to hate ants.

1279
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,124
I don't know if anyone
has mentioned it to you...

1280
01:33:35,124 --> 01:33:38,127
...but it looks to me like you could be
shaving in the wrong direction.

1281
01:33:38,127 --> 01:33:42,131
I wonder about that all the time.

1282
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:46,135
- Your father never taught you?
- He uses an electric razor, so I never asked.

1283
01:33:46,135 --> 01:33:50,128
Your father uses an electric razor?
I never knew that.

1284
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,142
He's light-haired,
so it never really mattered.

1285
01:33:53,142 --> 01:33:56,145
I really have to shave. It's no joke.

1286
01:33:56,145 --> 01:34:00,138
- So, what is the right way to shave?
- First, you wash with hot water.

1287
01:34:06,155 --> 01:34:10,148
They've just explained to me.
Aurora is coming now. Not a problem.

1288
01:34:12,161 --> 01:34:16,165
I know this is awkward,
but you'll be leaving town soon.

1289
01:34:16,165 --> 01:34:18,167
Now that everything seems set...

1290
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:22,171
...I should mention
that I'll be asking Montserrat out.

1291
01:34:22,171 --> 01:34:25,174
I can't remember how things were
before I was shot, but since then...

1292
01:34:25,174 --> 01:34:29,178
...l've had this incredible feeling for her.
Not some silly crush.

1293
01:34:29,178 --> 01:34:32,181
I've seen her in different situations.
Some were really difficult.

1294
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:35,184
You clearly realized the way things were,
before she did.

1295
01:34:35,184 --> 01:34:39,177
That was hard for her
as it was hard for you, before.

1296
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:44,193
We spent hours on the phone.
She's so fascinating.

1297
01:34:44,193 --> 01:34:46,195
I can't go back without her.

1298
01:34:46,195 --> 01:34:49,198
She'll like San Francisco
more than Chicago.

1299
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:53,202
It would be great, going to the Lake
with you and Greta there.

1300
01:34:53,202 --> 01:34:57,206
- God! You always do this.
- I always do this?

1301
01:34:57,206 --> 01:35:00,209
Can you try and be sympathetic
and cousinly?

1302
01:35:00,209 --> 01:35:02,211
Pretend I'm one of your customers.

1303
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:03,212
Okay.

1304
01:35:03,212 --> 01:35:06,215
But do we have to get into this now?
Things are a little tense.

1305
01:35:06,215 --> 01:35:08,217
My bride hasn't shown up.

1306
01:35:08,217 --> 01:35:10,219
She'll show up. She's gaga for you.

1307
01:35:10,219 --> 01:35:12,221
You think so?

1308
01:35:12,221 --> 01:35:16,214
She didn't spend time in the hospital
to see how <i>War and Peace</i> turned out.

1309
01:35:17,226 --> 01:35:19,228
She's actually looking forward
to the 80 channels...

1310
01:35:19,228 --> 01:35:23,232
...the consumer products.
It doesn't bother her.

1311
01:35:23,232 --> 01:35:26,235
Of course not. She's terrific.

1312
01:35:26,235 --> 01:35:29,238
You should want Montserrat
to have a chance of happiness.

1313
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:32,241
You're her chance of happiness?

1314
01:35:32,241 --> 01:35:34,243
Maybe.

1315
01:35:34,243 --> 01:35:37,246
So what's your plan?
You gonna play it somewhat cool?

1316
01:35:37,246 --> 01:35:41,239
I'm going to play it really cool.

1317
01:35:46,255 --> 01:35:50,248
Hello. Please.

1318
01:35:52,261 --> 01:35:56,265
I know some people think
that the articles I wrote...

1319
01:35:56,265 --> 01:35:59,268
...were in some way related
to your shooting.

1320
01:35:59,268 --> 01:36:03,272
I don't agree that a journalist
should be criticized for writing articles...

1321
01:36:03,272 --> 01:36:05,274
...he believes to be true.

1322
01:36:05,274 --> 01:36:09,267
But, if anything I've done has caused you
harm in any way...

1323
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:14,283
...please accept my sincere regret.

1324
01:36:14,283 --> 01:36:17,286
If there's anything I can do for you
in the future...

1325
01:36:17,286 --> 01:36:21,290
...please, do not hesitate.

1326
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,292
Thank you very much.

1327
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:27,285
Actually, I think there might be something.

1328
01:36:40,309 --> 01:36:43,312
These go with these, and those with those.

1329
01:36:43,312 --> 01:36:47,305
Fantastic!

1330
01:36:54,323 --> 01:36:55,324
Incredible.

1331
01:36:55,324 --> 01:36:59,317
You see, we're not such idiots.

1332
01:37:13,342 --> 01:37:15,344
She's really beautiful.

1333
01:37:15,344 --> 01:37:16,345
Yeah.

1334
01:37:16,345 --> 01:37:18,347
I am not sure how important that is.

1335
01:37:18,347 --> 01:37:20,349
I really like her.

1336
01:37:20,349 --> 01:37:23,352
She keeps asking about my underwear,
and then smirking...

1337
01:37:23,352 --> 01:37:26,355
...as if I am supposed to know
what she's talking about.

1338
01:37:26,355 --> 01:37:29,358
What are '<i>'</i>weekends of fun'<i>'</i>?

1339
01:37:29,358 --> 01:37:31,360
Oh, that.

1340
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,364
Montserrat was the same way.
It's a Barcelona girl thing.

1341
01:37:35,364 --> 01:37:37,366
It does sound familiar.

1342
01:37:37,366 --> 01:37:39,368
Odd.

1343
01:37:39,368 --> 01:37:42,371
That's what's great about
getting involved with a foreigner.

1344
01:37:42,371 --> 01:37:44,373
You can't take it personally.

1345
01:37:44,373 --> 01:37:48,377
What's really terrific is that when we act
in ways which might objectively...

1346
01:37:48,377 --> 01:37:52,370
...seem assholish, or incredibly annoying,
they don't get upset at all.

1347
01:37:53,382 --> 01:37:57,386
They just assume it's some
national characteristic.

1348
01:37:57,386 --> 01:37:59,388
- <i>Cosa de gringos.</i>
- Yeah.

1349
01:37:59,388 --> 01:38:03,381
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.
