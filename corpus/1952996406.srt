00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,000
[driver] Anson, you finally woke up,
like you slept all the way trough.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Who are you?
And how do you know my name?

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,250
I'm the driver,
and you are the passenger.

7
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,600
[sigh]
Where are we going?

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,300
[driver] Not far,
we are almost there.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,200
Where?

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Do...
do you remember anything?

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,500
[Anson] Of what?

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,600
Well...
anything?

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,900
No.
Why you ask?

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,500
Well... you are the 3rd kid in
less than 1 month I had to drive.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,000
Wh...
where are the kids?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,700
Anson, you have to pick
your seatbelt on.

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,400
Aah...
sorry.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,800
[aching]
Oow.

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,000
[driver] Are you OK kid?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm really feeling sick.

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,150

Ooh.
Spread kid.

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to find something
to clean you up with.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,300
Thank you.

Hey..,
there is someone out there!

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Hi Anson.
How are you?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Have we met before?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Come,
we have to go.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,490
I can't.
I'm going to a place.

33
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,700
Where?

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,100
I don't know, but... the
driver... who is taking me.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come,
there isn't a lot of time.

36

[thunderclap]

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,500
What is happening?
What do you want from me?

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,800
I want to help you.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,500
I don't need your help
or anyone else's!

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,000
How many pills
Anson?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
What do you want
from me?

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,300
How many pills
did you take?

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,100
I need someone
of my parents.

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,900
I need someone of my parents!

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm afraid you can't.
How many pills?

46
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
[thunderclap]

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,590
What if the things
they call me are true?

49
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,500
What things?
Who?

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
The kids at school
...they kick me

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
they punch me
...call me names...

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
...every day.

53
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,100
And I lost my best friend.

54
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,300
Is that why you took the pills?

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
What if the things
they call me are true?

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,300
What if
they are not?

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,000
But what if
they are?

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
You won't be able
to find that out now.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Can I please see
my parents?

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm afraid you can't.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm sorry... it was just too much
I didn't know what else to do.

Please...
is there anyone to help me?

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
You said
you would help me!
