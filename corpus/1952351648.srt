6
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,400
Hi, I'm Tripp.

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,700
I live in New York.

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,100
Not the city, but the north wing,
peripheral,

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,900
where all have a happy marriage in
behind a white fence.

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,200
I know how it feels to be married.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,500
You're married, David?

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
Yes, and we are a happy marriage.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,800
- Well, to begin.
- Let 's go.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, in a Saturday afternoon,

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,200
just finished lawnmowers,
after I went and got garbage washing.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,900
Ordinary things with the wife
my Eve, I instruct.

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,300
Evelyn.

18
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,600
Hi. Hi.

19
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
Is this tree is a little chubby.

20
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,100
You took your other bag?

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,100
My birthday is approaching, so I can a
consider as your gift to me.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Here's what happened that day.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,000
She is my wife, Eva with her red mail Etelä II
ii red shoes, red i jewelry.

24
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,100
She likes red. Likes
for a place in the limelight.

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,000
And he is my partner, Gary.
Gary Johnson.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
It is the kind of man with a conformation
athletic, like Wall Street.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,200
Name is Gary Johnson
matches you best.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,900
Likes company was founded
and then sell them.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,200
Your idea caught.
I must admit that your idea has caught on.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
But you'll need me, pal.

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,000
- Partners?
- Really? Yes.

32
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,300
Me and Gary we decided was established from a
company medical assistance, Medikal.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
But I needed money
to attract investors.

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,600
I thought I suficienþi 5 million
dollars to put the product on standing.

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,200
We also believe that the product can bring
billion dollar industry profits.

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,900
In addition, it is for a noble cause. We offer
people without insurance a hand.

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,500
We do not sponsor worthy causes.

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,265
And nonprofit sites are not
an option.

39
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,100
Gary, you must be careful with words
American speeches.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
We started on the scene investments

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but not with visions or play
grand ideas come.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Angela Gary's contact with investors
has decided to help.

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,700
Definitely something you watch, but
Think you better how to Bring Customers.

44
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,800
Meanwhile I will try to
find investors.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
So he chose to help us.

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,200
What do you have?

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
I think I heard enough.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,600
If we form the right team,
gentlemen, we immediately move to investment.

49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
We just have enough money to keep business
standing for one year.

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,000
Then I did some hiring.

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
Such as frame.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Never ... never told me not
and that I was not drunk.

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,000
But the problem was Eve.

54
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,800
I want to be with a guy
there is no point to life.

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,900
I thought you could go back
back to the hospital.

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,700
No. Not even the so simple.

57
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I do not sustain too much at first.

58
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,300
Until he read an article.

59
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,000
Young millionaires under 30 years
Online sexy bomb.

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
And you can be a sexy bomb.

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
There has always been and a.

62
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
When I was a doctor in Philadelphia ...

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
Can you learn it on my husband and
thing?

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,900
and touched the wrong areas ...

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,400
I apologize ...

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,900
I finally reached when the
I had to take a decision.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,000
I could combine with a lot of women
as my colleague Damian.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,300
Thanks This one site, you combine
ten times easier, man.

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Or I could get married.

70
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,500
A woman I find my way,
not like that, through dating services.

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Looking for a woman with whom to marry,
not just ... I sleep with her.

72
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Claire, do you think we can exit from a juice
tonight?

73
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,900
Marriage seemed
a better option.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,200
- Here are you?
- Yes, two years ago.

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,600
I need to find someone to
feel attracted to me.

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Mary, you're a whore.

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,000
It's my brother Chico.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
What are you doing with this guy here?

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,200
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

81
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,900
- That e. ..
- Do not worry I changed my sex.

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,900
Just when I calculate my options.

83
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,200
Eva, who was nurse at the same hospital
I wrote on the dating site.

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Probably after I saw the local newspaper.

85
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
- For me?
- Yes.

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,900
Thank you.

87

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,300
Had not.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,000
Of course that had.

89
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Money and power does not impress me.

90
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,400
I like simple things in life.

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
They even offered to pay consumaþia.

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,200
If the note comes meantime,
I pay it.

93
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
And then ...

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,700
- Poftiþi note, sir.
- Thanks.

95



00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
I felt wonderful.

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
And me.

97
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Sorry, I can not do that.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
Excuse me.

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,800
I, I ...

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,200
- Do you have a gum or ...
- No. Get involved too much and i. ..

101
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,500
I promised myself that I gonna have physical contact
unless a man marry him.

102
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,200
- What do you mean?
- Good night, Tripp.

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,100
And I got married to me.

104
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,200
Not find one
ies and gentlemen of honor.

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Rowan.

106
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,400
My cousin Rowan,

107
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,000
was not seen with good eyes when he stole
ies and one of princes of honor at the wedding.

108
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,900
It was the first person I
say about my idea

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
to founding his own company.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If I have one for each bãnuþ
idea that out of the bottom

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,100
I would billionaire.

112
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
What is that idea of yours?

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,900
Well ... medical plans are obsolete.

114
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,200
15 years ago gave
indemnities doctors.

115
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,200
- In 80 'the first people increase.
- Okay, listen.

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
You're somehow Greek?
Because history does not interest me.

117
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Tell me the idea.

118
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,400
My idea is to have 401 types
health insurance accounts.

119
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,900
So, you mean medical organization
is great, and you want to keep.

120
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,500
I stick, I like.

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,700
- When was it covered?
- See, that's the good part.

122
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,500
Yet no one working on it.
There is a legal framework.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,500
You should talk to Gary Johnson.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
He has helped to raise Uncle Aaron
some money for his company.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
That is why I gave up being a doctor.

126
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,200
There seems to be a huge cylindrical object
stuff in your colon

127
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,000
Your idea caught.

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,400
Then I hired Rowan to help us
to bring in sales and customers.

129
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
It's good bad.

130
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
I wonder how's the weather down there?

131
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,300
What?

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No matter.


133
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,100
Let's play chess.

134
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,200
Excuse me, I move first.

135
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,300
He moved us when we did
children how to maintenance plans

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
and how to manage costs.

137
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,400
We have two cars.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,900
We sell one.

139
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,500
Which?

140
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,500
- A to rain.
- I hope not.

141
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
What the hell does that mean?

142
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Tripp, can your tell you?

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Sure.

144
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,000
I want to understand that I
personally involved in your situation,

145
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
reasons that I no
explain.

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,900
I want to know I do not do this for money.

147
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,900
They do this because I want to help people.

148
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
And I'm here because I want to help.

149
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Understand?

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes, I think so.

151
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,800
I mean,
I am here because I want to help.

152
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,600
All right.

153
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,200
All right.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,900
How's the book?

155
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,000
Noisy neighbor to the toilet.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
The book is amazing.

157
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,300
It's the way it should be.

158
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,500
Yes? How?

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,300
Informative, buddy.

160
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,000
I say what I want to know about

161
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,900
as women learned to behave
the type to be combined.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,100
A wife must not take possession
such information, right?

163
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,100
- I do not relate to things and a.
- Take care, depends on women.

164
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,300
Do not have time for this to
Holidays.

165
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,800
My client has a row of drinks
because we won the case.

166
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,100
Congratulations.

167
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,200
Dave Carroll.

168
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Yes, yes, well done Dave.

169
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,000
Knowledge Charmed, I'm Rowan.

170
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,900
And seek not a lawyer, because
are the victim of an accident

171
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
and not be accused of malpractice.

172
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,500
Just to get to the point.
I suppose that you do, you're a lawyer.

173
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,900
I got the right marriage
with divorþurile.

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Congratulations.

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,100
I enjoyed you.

176
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,400
Wait a little, actually ...

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,200
and it involves the protection of property.

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,000
They are king in the protection of property.

179
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I can do to show that
a battlefield after the war.

180
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Okay, you have a business card?

181

I figured I.

182
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,100
Step 1: attraction. As you get closer to
monster must first know what it attracts.

183
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,300
<i> A year after marriage. </ i>

184
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,000

185
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,500
Gotta go to job.

186
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,000

What, not know to ride a bike?

191
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,100
Until there are 16 km.

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400

- Yes, I closed the garage.

00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,300

198
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Okay, take taxis.

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,900

What are you talking me here. Wait!

- I hope not to become too complicated.
- Tell me honestly, what chances do I have?

203
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
It's about trust.

204
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,200
In whom you trust more
the man or woman?

205
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800

208
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,400

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,600

Maybe.

242
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,000
I knew it.

243
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,300
Mother warned me in respects

Of course you do.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,700
and you call every hour to check yourself.

248
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
You think you know all, do you?

249
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,600
Honey, I read as a book.

250
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,900
You're the type who plays cautiously.
There are countries you like to.

251
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
You'd be surprised how
I can be imprudent.

252
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,600

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,300
Let me think.

256
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,500

All right.
Because I am not thought it was.

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,000

- Yes.

262
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500

How did you do that?

272
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,200
He disappeared. Not anymore.

273
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,900
He is my friend, Tripp.

274
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,800
- Ladies ... is the best guy in the world.

Have fun here?

279
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, until now.

280
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,900
Let me pay you.

281
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,400
Keep the change.

282
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,400
Nice of you.

283
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
No problem.

284
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,800
Gotta go now.

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,100
But I ...


286
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
- Do not know what ...
- What happened?

287
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,300
I bought a drink, then left.
I think everything goes perfectly.

288
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,700
I had three interest
I avoided the pitfalls, we built attraction

289
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
and you shall buy her friend a
goddamn drink.

290
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Well, I do not know what talk.

291
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,400
All leaves after you pay them drink.

292
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,400
How did you know that I
I wanted to be friendly.

293
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,300
Consumaþia girls guys they pay.

294
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,500
Can we stop a minute?

295
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,400
I think the other side of the case that
we need to focus is your picture.

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You understand?

297
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,900
Yes, I think so.

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Iara and you?

299
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,500
- You can not stay away, do you?
- I have something unwise for you.

300
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,800
Let me guess. A to
run together on a field of daisies.

301
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I mean, I can do that.

302
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Well, can you give us
note and leave.

303
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,100
Let's see.

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,800
What?

305
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,200
- How your rash appears?
- Jokes are?

306
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,400
That's yours.

307
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
Thanks, I appreciate.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,100

a fee of $ 10,000

310
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200

Wonderful.

313
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
We're gonna take that as a
vote of confidence.

314
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,765
Evelyn.

315
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,200
When me and Rowan we returned from Chicago
then I found the letter from Dr. Turner.

316
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,800
Come.


317
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
- Thank you, Dr. Turner.
- You're welcome.

318
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
Goodbye. Sorry.

319
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
A. Close the door

320
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,200
Yes.

321
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,900
Was a patient.
A patient perseverance.

322
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,900
A very patient perseverance.

323
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,200
My name is Tripp.

324
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
- Sit.

325
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,400
- What brings you here?
- I think know the one on my wife, Eva.

326
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I think when you met
Evelyn has been presented.

327
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, unfortunately my sound familiar
name.

328
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,700
God.

329
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Are you married her?

330
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,700
Poor you, amãrâtule.

331
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,800
I apologize.

332
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,200
Perhaps you're a doctor.

333
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,800
Because that's the only reason
who would marry you.

334
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:11,400
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes, I am a doctor, but do not understand ...

335
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,000
View.

336
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,900
Maybe it's something personal but I
found this letter ...

337
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,600
- Assume that you have written it.
- Let me see.

338
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,200
What?

339
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,300
It's a male.


340
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll thank you.

341
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,300
I wrote this letter when
broke the engagement.

342
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
Now there is nothing for me.

343
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,900
- So you've been logodiþi?
- Fucking bitch.

344
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,100
- So you've been engaged to her?
- Yes.

345
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,200
You must know I was logodiþi.

346
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,900
I let her move in with me after
what and lost his job as a nurse.

347
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,000
I remember one thing and
namely that after six months ...

348
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,000
we got engaged.

349
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,000
That we have not seen
signs.

350
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,200
- What signs?
- Those with "danger."

351
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,000
Signs of hell.

352
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,400
My things have started to disappear from
cabinet and was replaced with hers.

353
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,900
My things have disappeared into nothingness.

354
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Bills from the restaurant started
to grow rapidly.

355
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,700
I read mail, follow me,
I'll sign the checks.

356
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,900
My checks.

357
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,700
A lot of things. Must
to be very careful at these things.

358
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
Do you suddenly realize that your life is not
May I'll belong.

359
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I was disoriented.

360
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,200
- Welcome ...
- But then I read an article.

361
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,500
There was something
called "test with the island.

362
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,000
- Island ...
- Test the island.

363
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What was this test?

364
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,600
What you need to do is
women go on an island ...

365
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,400
at a resort.

366
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,000
In fact, this resort is next
The ravine where one can stand you.

367
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,400
Ravine, that is a bad place, a
Fri gay place.

368
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,800
Minus two star motel located
Besides that wonderful resort.

369
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,200
Then you say that you can do a lot of
money. You're filthy rich type.

370
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,500
That are reached.

371
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,900
And I expecting to see how reacts
she stands in another place.

372
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,400
A smart thing.

373
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,900
Sun Sounds of avarice.

374
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,500
You think that's stinginess.
You know what it means to be stingy?

375
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
To think about the diamond that are
it's cursed, it's yours,

376
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,800
but really it starts with him and
not see him ever.

377
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,900
And yet something, I hate to say that your,
but you, my son,

378
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,200

near a river.

379
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,900
He and the one to get.

380
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
But, given the rules man
and that we are men,

381
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,900
you could you live in a caravan
Kim, Karen, Christine.

382
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
If you're smart, of course.

383
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,400
Not sure if you do know better, but

384
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,200
I could to ask for advice?

385
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,400
BGIN No, what the hell I know
about your problems?

386
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,400

387
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Yes.

388
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,500
First mistake.

389
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
Your told to put a gãrduleþ
small and white around her?

390
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes, we have a fence micuþ,
but it wants a bigger one.

391
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,300
- Our Gãrduleþul nice.
- He has very feminine decor, so I ...

392
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,700
I get to me lemonade, please?

393
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Lemonade.

394
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,500
Everything has bought
my credit card.

395
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,700
Do not get angry because I bought
still a purse.



396
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,000
My birthday is approaching, so I can a
consider as your gift to me.

397
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
Look, I found shoes
I like the Signature.

398
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,100
It appears that you do a lot of money
over a long period.

399
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,000
I wanted your take something.

400
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,800
The other was very nice, but
this is very nice.

401
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You signed a contract prenupþial?

402
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,500
No.

403
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,600
Well, you know something ...

404
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:59,300
- Well not to me it seems funny, Dr. Turner.
- You're an exploratory robbery.

405
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,500
All I can do for you, son, is
to show you where to buy your a caravan.

406
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Okay?

407
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,400
Because you have burned.

408
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Then I realized that man's existence
is measured depending on the value of

409
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
and depending on how much worth
his wife for him.

410
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,000
I agree with you.

411
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,000
Excuse me, what you read there?

412
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,500
Read the palm of your client.

413
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
And what say?

414
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
It's confidential.


415
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,800
And surrounded by a layer
tractable imaginary.

416
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,000
We provide such incentives
materials members ...

417
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,500
We will give points, discounts,
meal vouchers, you understand ...

418
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Have questions?

419
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,900
I have a question.

420
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,700
How is called your plan?

421
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
On the way to the next meeting
we got lost.

422
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,100
Do I have to stop
look on the map.

423
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,500
Wisconsin interesting stop.

424
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,700
State ...

425
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,100
You know, it's weird because we went back a little.

426
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,400
Had to virãm to ...

427
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Tripp, boy, suddenly yearn traffic
the city from midday

428
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
after taxi drivers and drug addicts ...

429
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

430
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,500
But first I think I put a chicken
sleep to escape the cynical landscape

431
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,200
and as you are the one who decides

432
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,100
if you have any club meets the night
way, you must stops.

433
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,700
I do not want to go to any
nightclub.

434
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,400
At conventions, nightclubs are ...

435
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,800
are interesting in a way ...

436
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Listen, rule number one:
do not become a customer forever.

437
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,500
- To record?
- Yes. I joked.

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,200

She says she does not count money
but makes the customer how to feel.

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,000
And you do not mind that girl

Is your dancers?

444
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,200

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,600
- My friend is jealous.
- Too bad.

449
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,500
Show me your palm.

450

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,100
Do not you be embarrassed, it's okay,
c. do not bite

451
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,600
- You're crazy.
- Wait a little, you see.

452
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I do not want your heart broken, but not
to the law there anything ...

453
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,200

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,900
He and the is.
I have a little girl of five years.

455
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,100
Wonderful.

456
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
Do you realize it only if
you look at my hand?

457
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Wait, that there's something else.

458
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Let me see ...

459
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,600

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I say that
Do you will change careers soon.

461
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,500
Medical assistance that will be ...

462
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,100
or ... minder.

463
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
I do not believe.

464
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Talk seriously? I work here as you
save money for school assistance.

465
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,800
Honey, I write here.

466
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
It's very simple.

467
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,200
Let me just watch once.

468
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
This is crazy.

469
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
You have done alone
at an early age.

470
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Who did that?

471
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,100
But it looks like you'll be fine.

472
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Motherfucker is an alcoholic.

473
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,300
She always said that if you want something
You can obþii.

474
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,900
I left home at age 15 and
I have not talked to him since then.

475
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,000
Read not say anything.
It's too much and do not think you can endure.

476
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,400
- No, do not stop. I want to know, tell me.
- No.

477
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,500
I'm done.

478
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Should continue in other

479
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,100
- Have you eaten?
- No, but I can not go.

480
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,600
Okay, Tiger Lilly ...

483
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,600
Take care.

484
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,500
You see? I have not spent any money.

485
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,300
One can exit with a stripper
tonight?

486
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,400
Why not?
It's cool.

487
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Yeah, like that is, but when you started
to read in your hand?

488
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Well do not read, that's the beauty.

489
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,100
I mean, what is this?

490
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,400
About an abusive father, a child ran
home, a possessive boyfriend ...

491
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,500
It's the same story.

492

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Need to read target.

493
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,300
Your client, whatever it may be, that the
I want to combine.

494
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
Exotic dancer:
Do not leave impressed, not become a customer.

495
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,700
But did you say that you meet with other
Stripper in New York.

496
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes, it is a retraining.

497
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,600
If you say that you meet with a
Another dancer

498
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,000
Think about it why can not it afterwards.

499
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,900
I knew it the guy at bar
that I saw when I entered.

500
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,500
Need to know are ground.

501
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,100
Where you know all this stuff?

502
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,700
You know what, forget it, you are married.

503
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:11,300
He and the E, all right, yes. We should
Consider planning the first customer.

You want them to show you what I'm watching.

507
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Brazil.

508
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,300
There would have to go on vacation.

509
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,800
Interesting.

510
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,700
Good luck, cousin. The meeting was the shit.

511
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,700
Where the hell was your head?

512
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,800
I think Eve.

513
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,100
Eve? What about her?

514
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,600
I do not know, does not seem to have a stable
marriage in the true sense and

515
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,200
feel that it sometimes pull the strings.

516
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
You could say that your first day.

517
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,500
- Thanks.
- Yes.

518
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,200
Men like you are easy prey
women like her.

519
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,100
Easy prey? What?

520
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,200
How to approach a woman
Why talk to her?

521
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,200
I do not approach the women, Rowan,
I am married.

522
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,600
Let us pretend a little.

523
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,400
How did you start talking? What did you say?

524
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,700
I do not know. Probably
"Hi I'm Tripp. What is your name?"

525
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,100
And what she should do,

526
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,100
chiloþii give you-and down-and open to
feet and beg you to have a go at home?

527
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,900
Obviously not gonna happen like that,
ie ...

528
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,300
If you want to get me her number
phone him and a compliment,

529
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,900
or give him something to drink and hoping
this time not to leave.

530
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,600
According to reality.
And others do exactly as men.

531
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,500
- Like most men.
- Yes, I believe it.

532
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,100
Let 's get it otherwise.

533
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Say ... to say that a sexy girl
begins to age 18.

534
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,000
Puicuþa sexy:
Keep easily impressed. Expensive

535
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Is part of the approach, perhaps
5 times per day.

536
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Lost your phone number.
I say it again?

537
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,200
Hi baby. Can your offer you a drink?

538
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,400
Hi.

539
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,800
That means it will be addressed
140 times per month.

540
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,700
Until the age of 25 years will be
approached 12,000 times.

541
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
- The 11 093 times
- Yeah, whatever.

542
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,500
Look at me
that you understand what I mean.

543
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,700
What do you exit the Evidence?

544
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,300
- I do not know. I say it's beautiful.
- Finish.

545
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,400
It's beautiful.
I think it has not said that?

546
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,500
They will not be told compliments.
They feel they have a high value.

547
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Because it must exit
in this world.

548
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,500
Should look different than me.
Look at me.

549
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,000
Slightly different.

550
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,000
Just do not want to be that guy in the club
shirt in stripes

551
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,800
the eyes of steel, with a beer
without alcohol in my hand,

552
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,300
behaving as if your would be afraid to
talk to women who pass away.

553
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,200
Good, and how does this relate to my wife?

554
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,500
Women like Eva did not like to be attracted
men like you

555
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,400
not a good situation.

556
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,600
Why, because it is beautiful, or
because I said I think is beautiful?

557
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,000
Has no link with
it's beautiful.

558
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,600
I have to ask, why
Eva loves you.

559
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,500
Be careful, my friend Zan approach.

560
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,200
Zan is the master naturaleþii.

561
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,800
Zan, what are you doing?
Nice to see you, man.

562
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,000
He is my cousin, Tripp.

563
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,465
- Tripp I'm Zan.
- Master naturaleþii.

564
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,400
Why sit here alone
the beautiful women there.

565
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,200
There is beauty and paradise
I sit here.

566
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,600
Talk.

567
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Yes, what?

568
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,100
Tripp's talking about his attraction.

569
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,500
Attraction? It's very simple.

570
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,000
A man who likes women is
liked by women.

571
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,300
Will be attracted to you
like a moth to light.

572
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,600
All will be part of a
romance.

573
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,800
How is your story
love, Tripp?

574
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,400
You see?

575
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,000
You must create a little magic.

576
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,000
Look at him. In three seconds he disappeared.
Is the rule of three seconds.

577
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,300
See a girl that you like?

578
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,400
In 3 seconds go to her and tell her
anything you ask any. No matter.

579
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
Hoping to win-your fear.

580
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
They feel fear.

581
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,200
Apparently there is a fear in my heart,
I have inherited her over the years,

582
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,300
probably when I was hunters.

583
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,500
If talking to a woman who belonged
another man, our life was endangered.

584
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,900
I condiþionaþi of this fear
get closer to women.

585
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,300
No more fear of it, trade off
it, now you can protect the ego.

586
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,800
It's about confidence.
Look at Zan.

587
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,600
See how to behave naturally? Fineþea
it makes women feel comfortable.

588
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,900
Displays a smile.

589
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,000
A to learn ... can.

590
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,500
Vegas, baby.
The real attraction America.

591
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,500
Here we stay?

592
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,400
No, stay there.

593
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,300
See that motel?
Got a room there for both.

594
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,000
That game that you play it with me women
business can help you finish.

595
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,300
Who knows, maybe if I knew it, I'm Eva
loved for who I am.

596
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Rowan, I learn?

597
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,300
What?

598
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,000
- What?
- You play practice ...

599
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,400
- No, no, no ...
- I'll learn?

600
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,400
Tripp, I know what open marriage,

601
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,300
not save them, not fix them.

602
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,900
May consist of all kinds
As you see you.

603
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,500
Where I know what you're gonna learn not
're gonna uses to track women?

604
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,200
I know are pretty good.

605
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,500
Well, then you must your
change the style.

606
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,100
But that is not my style at your convenience?

607
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,100
Rowan.

608
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,500
To use his game to Rowan
business end, seemed a good idea then.

609
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,900
But that means to change my attitude
faces of Eve, to be successful.

610
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,500
As I said earlier,
It comes down to that question

611
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,000
"In whom you trust?
The man or woman? "

612
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,200
There was and image problem.

613
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,100
I could not tell Eve that was
to learn from Rowan.

614
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Let the games begin <i> </ i>

615
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
First Impressions: Image, style and identity.
Who mind more, women or men?

616
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,400
You see?

617
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
Yes. You saw, did you notice
What happened?

618
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Yes, me I opened the door and
She has looked at you.

619
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
Exactly. We created a picture in her mind.

620
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,000
The image of a villain, but no matter,

621
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,700
because it can turn anytime
in a conversation.

622
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,600
Tripp ...

623
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,900
- He is Sugardaddy.
- Shit.

624
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,200
Man is costumaþie professional,
is a merchant of style.

625
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,200
Merchant of style?

626
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,500
- You are the AFC?
- AFC?

627
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,900
Yes, medium-sized fellow frustrated.

628
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,900
Get glasses, man.

629
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,800
Hell, no.

630
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,300
That you your matches, gigolos.


631
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,600
- That's cool. Yes.
- I agree with you, man.

632
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,900
Tripp, boy, get in game tonight.

633
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,600
The best names are Latin.

634
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,400
I've chosen Ricky. He and introduce myself.

635
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,100
To me and I choose a Latin name?

636
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,900
No. You are going to be Max. Yes.
Max Stout.

637
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
A friend of mine in England.

638
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,200
And do not forget the accent, is very important.
Women love the accent.

639
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,000
- Exactly.
- I show an exotic edge.

640
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,000
- Find your noisy?
- Yeah, yeah, drink?

641
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,600
Top: attraction, comfort are built,
Seduce and conclude.

642
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
See ring that.

643
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,900
I call it seducþiei ring.

644
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Attraction: demonstrates that you
value to attract women.

645
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,100
Take all fears, all doubts
worries about the tone of voice,

646
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
penis size and everything you
makes you feel unsafe you

647
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,500
and enter them in the ring.

648

00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,000
Put it on your finger and uses it as the force
that makes you move forward.

649
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,500
Okay, what's up with the set?

650
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,300
Women do not ever go alone.

651
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,700
Set of 2 means a group of two women.
Set of three means three women, and all the and a. ..

652
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,000
I understand reading.

653
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,100
If there is one man and one group is
AMOG, the male of the group.

654
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,300
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

655
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,800
Target is the woman that you like the group.

656
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,900
Stay away from a group of two women alone.
You must have joined a friend.

657
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,500
- Why?
- Because your friend will sustain.

658
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,200

When approaching a group of three women alone
while you talk to one,

659
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
will remain and the other two.

660
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,700
Yes, yes.

661
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,900
The male of that group,
You say you want to knock him.

662
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,800
Find out who is and tell him
some deterrent.

663
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,400
Man, I like your shirt.
I had and I just in a school.

664
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,700
Cool, man.

665
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,500
I want to go to the bar girl.
You see, the blond?

666
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,000
I want to ask who remember more
man or woman?


667
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

668
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,200
Who remember more man or woman?

669
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,700
Men lie more, asshole.

670
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,200
Ladies, can I ask you think?

671
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,300
My friend who talk about
remember more, she gives the man.

672
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,600
Man.

673
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Not talking to you, dear.

674
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,100
Talking with you.

675
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,900
Can you do us and us a picture?

676
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,600
<i> addresses a group of device
camera. </ i>

677
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,000
God jokes are?

678
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,400
- It's a terrible photo.
- This is a successful photo.




679

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,200
It's horrible. Want to see a photo

a successful, wait a little.

680
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,700
- Who is?
- Is my nephew. S love of my life.

681
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,000
And you do not like to take them instead.

682
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,300
Take a look at this face.

683
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,300
We met last night in a club.

684
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,300
He asked me to take a picture.

685
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,300
Left began to argue,
he called me and told me that he felt something

686
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,500
and then ran home.

687
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,000
- What do you think of felt?
- What is felt?

688
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
God is Adam's apple.

689
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,200
E man. He was man.

690
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,200
Beautiful hands. Are real?

691
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
I do a favor, went to a store

692
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,300
and I bought 10 boxes of condoms.

693
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,700
We arrived in Tokyo and when I joined
customs agents opened my bag

694
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,900
and all people from all began to laugh.
Laughing hysterically.

695
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,100
Behind me was a blonde.

696
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,400
I turned to leave but before you go
I saw the open bag

697
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,000
and pulled out a huge dildo in her.
He started it in the air butterfly.

698
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
I tell you, it was insane.

699
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,900
Everyone looked and blond and ISE is înro
, just as you have not ever seen.

700
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,900
Semana least with you.

701
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,600
Not really.

702
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:27,900
You were.

703
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,700
You mean I should behave as a
asshole with that to attract customers?

704
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,100
Not necessarily.

705
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,300
It's a beautiful ring.

706
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,000
You knew that the ancient Egyptians felt that

707
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,200
that a person has finger ring
say much about that person?

708
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,800
And tell my why?

709
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I can not tell your right now, but if I
accompanies're up there your gonna explain.

710
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
What?

711
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,265
I'm Max.

712
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
- Victoria.
- Charmed Knowledge.

713
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,200
Yes.

714
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm from England.

715
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,500
I do not think you want to see them on this.

716
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,400
Why? Looks like you had a great time.

717
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,200
<i> build and comfort you. </ i>

718
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,400
- Whose car?
- What counts?

719
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,600
What we want most?

720
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
A girl fell hard.

721
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Claire, do you think we can exit from a juice
tonight?

722
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,600
I mean, you want to go but not now?

724
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Another time?

725
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
If you want to win You're a woman
unavailable must be released.

726
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,400
Claire, you look amazing today, want to
exit IM juice tonight?

727
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm sorry, I must
sleep early.

728
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
Show him you're a man who knows what he wants
and who knows how to get what he wants.

729
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,500
Wait a little, I've invited you to a drink
and you want to put me in bed already?

730
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,300
Do not ever give your rating.

731
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,700
And what do you do?

732
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,800
If a woman asks you something,
is not an indicator of interest.

733
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,600
It's a trap. Try to make you
characterize and answering the question.

734
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,700
When you reply to
Question to beat you.

735
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,600
That has demonstrated your value
more social than you.

736
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,100
And avoid such pitfalls?

737
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,000
Transforming it into a hook.

738
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,900
Eviþi answer.

739
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,900
How do you respond unanswered.

740
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,900
Ask me what I do.

741
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,500
What do you do?

742
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
It's a horrible question.
I could not ask anything else?

743
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
System is repaired
Garbage disposal

744
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,000
Half the women had a value
high social.

745
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
Why do you think they feel that?

746
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,200
Assumed to be as large firms.
Have a lot of attention.

747
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,600
Warning. Exactly. Bravo. Good.

748
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,100
You see? I never said a word about me
however, and now I only think about myself.

749
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
What is Think?
It thinks that you love children,

750
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,300
I'm open to marriage, that walking with
beautiful women and that we succeed.

751
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,200
I never praised, so I think they are modest.

752
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,500
So we serve terms and stories

753
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,000
and begin negotiating the first
meeting with the client.

754
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,700
Intuits them are waiting,
win their confidence tigi

755
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,500
and business can not possibly go wrong.

756
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,400
- Exactly.
- It's simple.

757
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,600
Finger it, that you ring it
represents the god Dionysus.

758
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,000
Make a link here ...

759
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,700
Try to achieve comfort

760
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,700
My name is Max Stout.

761
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,800
- You said Stowe?
- What?

762
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,800
Like beer?

763
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
What is ...?

764
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,200
Stowe as beer, do not know?

765
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,200
Stowe? No.

766
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,100
A knowledge are the queen?

767
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,800
- Queen?
- Queen of England?

768
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,200
Exactly, no, no ...

769
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,000
not part of the royal family.

770
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:44,900
No?

771
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
... then the heart. Feel?

772
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
You feel?

773
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,900
Home sweet home.

774
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,800
- What have we here?
- Look.

775
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,200
What we have there?

776
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,500
You tell me. Did I
sauna and said that I do not believe me.

777
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,600
- You were right.
- I always right.

778
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,200
If you think I'm a liar,
Let's play a game about lying.

779
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,500
So your lie brought a woman into bed

780
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,600
and honesty made me me
to marry.

781
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,000
Not lie, not lie. Come on.
E îmbrobodeala.

782
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Bring your A-to five questions and
I want to respond honestly to each.

783
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:30,100
Says.

784
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,900
- What color is my hair?
- Blue.

785
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,000
- Sun rose and the sunset now?
- Emerged.

786
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,100
- Very good.
- Go on, go.

787
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,500
- How many colors is the rainbow?
- 18.

788
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,700
I do not know if that's a lie or not
so I ...

789
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Then, just before you sell,

790
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,700
when it appears afirmaþia
"I'm not a whore"

791
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,100
his instinct is to remember that
looking for a man who wants more

792
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,600
than a one-night stand.

793
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,700
He and the is, and this company and i will
worry in our respects.

794
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,700
Exactly.

795
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,300
If you part of the resistance
last minute, as you do?

796
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,000
- You ...
- You comporþi like you expect.

797

00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,800
- He and the is.
- I know.

798
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,000
Or do you think I am kind of
a man who wants relationship lasting

799
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,400
or the expectations using its intuiesc
words like

800
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,200
"Where I know that you're talking seriously?"

801
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,200
Exactly.

802
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:25,200
And let's not and never to feel the
despair.

803
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,300
If you oppose resistance, stops you are.

804
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Get up ...

805
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,600
Light up light and turn it back.

806
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,800
He says he has fantasies about
chiloþii shoes.

807
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,600
He liked to wear women's chiloþi.

808
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,700
- Pray to God.
- It's easy. Why pray.

809
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,400
If we can conclude this business ajuþi
promise to bring only

810
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,000
one dollar banknotes.

811
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,000
It was wonderful.

812
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,700
Now that we have introduced the business managers
As we do with women throughout life,

813
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
what shall we do sometimes, as
must do, tell me?

814
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,800
Have to pull rabbits from hats,
love.

815
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,700
If I remember you're gonna call you.

816
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,700
You're an asshole.

817
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,600
Anything goes.

818
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,400
Let's play "How's the weather down there?

819
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,400
It's a hot field, Cloudy
rain or clear skies.

820
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,100
On it is becoming clear.

821
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,500
Yes, let's play thing expulsion.

822
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,400
How long does it bet on a certain type
to approach a woman and be expelled.

823
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,900
You see that guy over there, with glasses?
Give him 45 seconds.

824
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,200
Come on, do not resist or even type
20 seconds.

825
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

826
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
6, 7, 8, 9 ...

827
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,600
- 10 seconds.
- He has already sent?

828
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
- Yes?
- Yes.

829
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
Well, the shows and songs to break-your ass.

830
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,500
Great chiloþei.

831
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,800
Top: attraction, comfort,
Seduction, Conclusion.

832
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,700
Realized that if we get
the process will be quite expensive.

833
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,800
What should I be expecting?

834
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,000
In the best case,

835
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,100
can advocate for an understanding of 50/50.

836
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,700
- And if you're okay with this ...
- No, I want to fight.

837
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,400
Level 2: comfort. Ever wonder how
to bring down the monster?

838
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,100
Hint: the game uses to make money.
Wealth bring out the worst of the monster.

839
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,200
Why wear it?

840
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
Why not?

841
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,100
May want to exit to get some im
dinner tonight.

842
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,600
You must learn to be that
to hire me.

843
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,700
Forgot?

844
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,100
You know, I have a meeting tomorrow in Minneapolis.

845
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,400
So you have to go tonight.

846
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,900
After dinner, do not try to profiþi
for me because I do not leave easily.

847
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,800
All right.

848
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,100
Can do this after you return.

849
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,200
Now I have other plans.
I have to meet my mother.

850
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,600
I ask you something.

851
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,400
- If you climb something will always go down?
- Yes.

852
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,600
Climb a flight and descends
in Minneapolis.

853
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,500
He attended one year of initiation in
Rowan's tactics

854
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,300
uate and attempt to contract and
a customer.

855
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,700
Money finishes.

856
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,600
Rowan's game not helped me
too much or in marriage.

857
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Rowan always said that we should
you know are targets.

858
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,400
Began to wonder what they think
those of the American Health,

859
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,800
company with which we must
meet the next day.

860
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Is fully occupied. It seems that all
Minneapolis hotels are full.
861
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,400
Then I realized how
I can use it on Rowan.

862
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,300
Jokes are?

863
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,400
I do not know where one can sleep safe at night.

864
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,100
No wonder that American Health postponed

How Do you call that greedy?

882
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,900
Good times are coming.

Do not worry in my respects,
I handle it.

898
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,600
I sacrifice myself for the team.

899
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,300
Men admire those who
walk with beautiful women.

900
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,000
It's like a social proof.

901
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,800
But practically had to make my point
a beautiful woman.

For this,
drink it from me.

920

00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,600
Okay? Wait a little.

00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,900
Deal?

00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,800
And I do not say you want to
be a princess.

941
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
A princess?

942
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,700
Is this the dream I gave up
long ago.

943
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,300
Just trying my family maintenance.

944
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,500
Like most girls here.

945
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,700
- Look at her.
- What?

946
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,800
Anna.

947
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,200
And I hate this job.

948
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,200
But does that to raise money to and
bring sick mother in Ukraine

949
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,200

Francine's chelneriþã and left me
to sleep on her couch.

956
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,600
Your client must be servant

957
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,500
- I was right.
- Yes.

958
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,300
Social proof.
Let's go.

959

961
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,400
every time I look
to you during the session

962
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
I want to confirm what I say, right?

963
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,600
're A small company.

964
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,900
You do not have customers and no money in account.

965
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,100
We are a corporation with a capital
40 billion dollars.

966
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,900
You can destroy only a part
actions of our organization.

967
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,000
Sir, we shall endeavor
to ensure the success of this project.

968
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,100
Have failed companies higher.

969

What you want to see?

970
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,600
The project is a success.

971
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,700
We want to be completed in six months.

972
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,100
See, to me, introduced to your
risk.

973
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,700
Because I feel a lack of interest
from your

974
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,800
Also I think your lawyers
We will poison the hârþogãraia.


975

I can not sign the agreement if we
safety regulations that are ready in 10 days.

You know something, you're right.

Yes, I brought a top product on the market

985
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,600
and I survived the worst
periods of history.

986
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,900
I mean, we have obtained authorizations without you
spend money on political support.

987
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,900
You're right, it is too risky.

988
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,800
So, do you want to continue?

989
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,900
Indecision leads to problems.

01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,700
- Do not tell me never.
- Stop. Stops.

1041
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,500
Stop me and poke your past.

1042
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,700
Okay? Because we have not done anything wrong.

1043
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,000
And now I'll be your mother.

1044
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,700
God must buy me
new clothes. And my breasts will become imeni I.

1045
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,400
You're very bad.

1046
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,900
Eve ...

1047
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,165
Welcome ...

1048
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,465
I'm bored enough.

1049
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,100
One to go out, I smoke
and one to rinse my mind.

1050
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,400
The stuff is related ...

1051
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,400
not my type.

1052
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,600
Speaking of clearing minþii ...

1053
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,900
one would presume your mind
the marriage was over.

1054
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,665
Yes. I mean ...

1055
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,300
For several reasons, mainly ...
that lay me.

1056
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,800
All right. Look ...

1057
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,300
Can I be honest with you?

1058
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,100
- Yes.
- Okay.

1059
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,900
Everyone remember the wedding.

1060
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,100
- Do not pathological.
- Pathology ...

1061
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,400
Look what I say ...

1062
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,600
You wanted divorce,
but she submitted to the action.

1063
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:00,300
So I ... I think ...

1064
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,100
You hit it on the rope.

1065
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,100
That can then to sell your company.

1066
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,900
Yes ... where did you know that?

1067
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,900
"Shark" ...

1068
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,200
Sure.

1069
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,100
Well, that was my plan, but

1070
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,800
not the way it functioned I expected.

1071
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,200
Gary told me that the Board
wanted to sell the company,

1072
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,100
I so I told him Gary
The situation with Eve.

1073
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,800
Anyway, I suggested to visit
His friend, John Gibbons.

1074
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,100
When I arrived I was surprised
the employee to see my frame.

1075
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,700
Then I found out that child

is not even mine.

1076
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm not gonna come back,

1077
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,000
and she lives in old house

1078
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,300
the guy who is real father ...

1079
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,400
And I rebuild my life?

1080
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,100
You how you feel?

1081
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,700
- Dr. Tripp, I'm right?
- Yes.

1082
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,400

Welcome to Association men
In elaþi and Women.

1083
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,600
Come, sit down.

1084
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,800
Let me tell you my story.

1085
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
A blond girl, Sexy,
wanted to marry me.

1086
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,000
With me! What if it was sexy.

1087
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,400
Then I found out ...
Good to meet you.

1088
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,200
Then I learned that one child.
A child of six years.

1089
01:03:06,235 --> 01:03:07,100
So I've adopted child.

1090
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,900
When we adopted child, I learned
that sleeping with everybody in the city.

1091
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,200
So I what I did?
I filed divorce.

1092
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,865
Then I clean the cow all.
Let me tell you how.

1093
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,300
Paying alimony
child is not mine.

1094
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:20,200
Pension they have paid and maintenance.

1095
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,200
Bitch!

1096
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,400
I have vasectomy
and I met a woman.

1097
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,500
Four months later told me that it is
pregnant and that should get married.

1098
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:28,600
I showed him the paper demonstrate
that we vasectomy.

1099
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,500
She sued
for child maintenance

1100
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,150
saying that I agreed
with a sperm donor,

1101
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:38,700
by chance
was guitarist in a band.

1102
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,400
I found out that the value of a company

1103
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,700
is based on when
action for divorce is entered.

1104
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,400
A so I expected that my wife
to introduce the first action of divorce.

1105
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,000
We used bait money.

1106
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,900
Function! But now my wife
I sued asking for more.

1107
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,300
I risked everything trying
I begin to firm,

1108
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,000
and now I'm in the process of selling a

1109
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,100
I want to cureþe.

1110
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,000
Well, it's not rocket science, is not it?

1111
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,200
It's very simple.

1112
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,000
You are to receiving a large amount
money, and want to divorce.

1113
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,200
Yes, basically ...

1114
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,800
And like you, your answer the next question
"No," I signed a contract prenupþial.

1115
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,365
I found out that the value of a company

1116
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,700
is based on when
action for divorce is entered.

1117
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,600
Eva refuses to leave
to use me for money.

1118
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,900
The only way
she could receive more than

1119
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,700
was if I were selling company
When divorce was introduced.

1120
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,600
I knew Eve play games.

1121
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,700
So I've gathered enough evidence about
it where we need to process.

1122
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,500
I needed Eve
to introduce the divorce action.

1123
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,300
That do not appear to try to divorce
before I sell my company.

1124
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
You know? A problem of reason.

1125
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,900
Doctor, may want
let us share the story are yours.

1126
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,000
Sorry, this is not for me ...

1127
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,400
I decided to meet
Samantha in Las Vegas.

1128
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,900
It was an easy job.

1129
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,300
Samantha would have given Eve
reason to introduce divorce.

1130
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,800
Infidelity.

1131
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,900
And then it disappeared as a witness.

1132
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,900
- Hey.
- Baby, let me I do it for you

1133
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,100

Dictionary. Thank you.

1135

I'm going to Las Vegas
two days at a conference.

1136
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,500
If something happens and your baby,
Notify me and right back home. Okay?

1137
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

1138
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,300
- Have fun, right?
- Yes.

1139
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:42,900
Let's go.

1140
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,700
<i> "That Night" 9:00 </ i>

1141
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,300
- What is that?
- That?

1142
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,565
That is my peacock ridge.

1143
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,700
If the girl looks and charm and have skirts
short time and we can do it.

1144
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,400
So we show our rivers, huh?

1145
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,000
Sure. Put it and I do and I Do.

1146
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,900
Hey, I'm glad to see you.

1147
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,000
I have to ask ...

1148
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,800
I searched the girl, Samantha.
Did not come.

1149
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,400
Hey, do not touch.

1150
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,500
- It Real?
- Yes. Certainly that is real.

1151
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,265
No, definitely not.

1152
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,800
Well then why did you ask?

1153
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,600
You must also know and something else?

1154
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,400
It was Fiona ...

1155
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,700
- Fiona?
- Fiona.

1156
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,400
- How your name again?
- If I'll say, answer five questions?

1157
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,400
- But you need to minds.
- You need to lie?

1158
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,600
All right. We're gonna get in the game.

1159
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,400
With tags that look like?

1160
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,500
Yes ...

1161
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,500
All right. Buy me a drink?

1162
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,900
- Yes.
- Great, I want a scotch.

1163
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,100
You know, my mom warned
related to girls like you.

1164
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,500
He and the men of doing it
to go home with you, do you?

1165
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,300
Îmbeþi them.

1166
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,400
Yes. He and the men to make them
to go home with me. Is it bad?

1167
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,800
How many questions did I put?

1168
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,600
- Three.
- You're very good at this game.

1169
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:54,200
- Are you sure it played?
- No.

1170
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,600
Well, you just lost.

1171
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,400
Breathing. Breathing.

1172
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,965
Do not call. Do not call!

1173
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,600
That guy you look there.
I think he wants to dance with you.

1174
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,500
- What? You should go to dance with him.
- No.

1175
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,500
- You want to dance with me?
- Yes, if I say something first.


1176
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,900
Look around.
Are beautiful women everywhere.

1177
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,500
What is wrong with you?
What you also like to get lucky?

1178
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,100
I wait and be good to play games.

1179
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,600
So I can not only have fun.

1180
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,200
- Get him. Get him!
- Push! Push!

1181
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,100
Remove it!

1182
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,900
When I found it to Samantha,
I used another woman in my game.

1183
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,000
Fiona. I do not believe it
as far as I could reach.

1184
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,000
Just as I warned Rowan.

1185
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,200
But that was once Pria
the attainment of a beautiful woman

1186
01:09:38,235 --> 01:09:42,500
without having to know anything about me
or as tigam win.

1187
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,400
I was tempted to go further, but ...

1188
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,100
was not the right time
so I gave back to my plan.

1189
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,500
I searched on Rowan and because
I found I did not leave the club.

1190
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,700
I went home after
I got the phone from the doctor

1191
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,700
about the birth of my little girl, Michelle.

1192
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,400
I could not find the phone Eve.

1193
01:10:03,435 --> 01:10:06,200
<i> two days later </ i>

1194
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,265
Yes, yes ...

1195
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,500
What? What you pay?


1196
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,700
Gotta finds you and you sleep with him.
I brought the divorce action today.

Goodbye.

1199

Want to see Daddy?

1200
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,800
God ...
That was the hospital.

1201
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,900
- Are you okay?
- Get away from my house.

1202
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,800
- You'll be all right?
- Yes.

1203
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,400
All right.

1204
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,400
- Wait. Can I see my daughter?
- I filed divorce papers.

1205
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,600
One can see on your daughter
when you are first visiting rights.

1206
01:10:49,635 --> 01:10:51,100
What have I done?

1207
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,700
What have you done?
Whose is this number?

1208
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,400
I do not know, maybe number of any customer.

We need your help, right? Must
to come into my house to gather evidence.

To go on in your house and steal

- Yes.

01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,500
Eve and a private detective
I watched and stole my laptop.

1394
01:21:37,535 --> 01:21:38,565
What are those?

1395
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,365
This is a video camera wireless microphone,

1396
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,000
reports of spyware,
GPS recording her movements the machine.

1397
01:21:44,035 --> 01:21:46,900
I installed a program home
on her computer before you go,

1398
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,400
and these reports have
that has entered the online meetings.

1399
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,200
He's created and accounts as and when it was me,

1400
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,700
to try and prove that one in it.
1401
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,000
But I records
they spoke with a guy.

1402
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,800
Having an affair with him.

1403
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,500
Recording of the meeting?

1404
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:03,600
Look, look for a mail ETA
or scared that he bought them.

1405
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,200
Is proof that he ...

1406
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,900
do more than ... I do not know.

1407
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,200
Look, I do not want to talk about it.

1408
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,300
- You're in ...?
- Do not ..

1409
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,000
Here is the place.

1410
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,700
Come on! Tripp, come on!
Enter the house.

1411
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,100
Damn ...
Come on! Come on!

1412
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,800

01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
Come on.

1414
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,200
Come, come.

1415
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,800
Hey, Rowan, Eva just went home.

1416
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,500
What? I do not care who are.

1417
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,100
Come here in ten minutes.

1418
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,800
Let's do it my way.

1419
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,765
I can not believe I did not know
what it represents.

1420
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,900
Wear it on the ring finger. You know you're
a worship of the god of darkness?

1421
01:23:36,935 --> 01:23:39,100
Since you do not ...
Give it to me.

1422
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:42,965
Thanks.

1423
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,100
Look closely. Do you see those two over there?

1424
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,700
Most of the booth. Those ones.

1425
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,300
I want to get the ring it, give it to him
and to say you is a gift from him.

1426
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,500
The ring is a gift ...

1427
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,300
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

1428
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,500

1432
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,700
Shit.

1433
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,100
My husband and me in the wrong

I found her phone number
the call list.

1436
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,200
Charges are true
of your past?

1437
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
Tripp of knew all about me
maiden.

1438
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,800
Now says he did not know.

1439
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,600
It's a girl involved, is not it?

1440
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,700
Fiona.

1441
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,800
I found them sitting together
in a hotel room.

1442
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:19,900
Lady, you have no proof
that of the husband did wrong and Samantha?

1443
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,800
Telephone records
and ticket.

1444
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,300
Because you have also accused
because of the tricky you Fiona.

1445
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,100
Write here your detective's report,

1446
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:35,200
that Tripp and Fiona,
evening at which you referiþi,

1447
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,600
served dinner
and he has not noticed any physical contact.

1448
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,000
And that he has pursued a movie.

1449
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:46,400
Fiona Where to watch movies,
and my client slept the whole movie.

1450
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,200
Then accuse them, and spent the night
together in a hotel.

1451
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,500
Here you actually write that
had separate rooms.

1452
01:25:53,535 --> 01:25:55,500
Ms. Judge is everything here.

1453
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,900
I mean, the facts speak themselves.

1454
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:02,500
Tell us please
Your version of the stories you know.

1455
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,100
Love is
the increasingly rare nowadays.

1456
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,765
It seems that people

they are so insecure

1457
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,900
prefer that you lied about
who really are.

1458
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:18,300
Just to be accept
and avoid being judged.

1459
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,300
So you think the lay Eve?

1460
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,800
Yes, but who do not mind?

1461
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:29,300
I mean, there are individuals who learn
the men to lie to attract women.

1462
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:33,400
And there are women's magazines
with titles like:


1463
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,200
"How to PACA are your man
to marry. "

1464
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,800
I mean ... PACA it are?

1465
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,700
Since people have pãcãliþi
to marry?

1466
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,200
It seems that we as a society and
promote lies

1467
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,900
and appreciate those who use them
love their personal benefit.

1468
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,165
You see, Eve I saw in a magazine

1469
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,600
who wrote
promiþãtori younger doctors.

1470
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,800
And hired a detective,
long before we were married,

1471
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,400
like to learn more about me.

1472
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,500
And and has made an account with a profile

1473
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,200
which exactly matches
what am I to a woman.

1474
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,900
I realized only during divorce

1475
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,000
that she wanted to find a man
not have a good opinion of himself.

1476
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,400
It later to have money.

1477
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,200
You mean ...

1478
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,400
what he really wanted Eve
was money in exchange for love?

1479
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,000
Yes.

1480
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,400
And honesty is the difference
between the front of my marriage with Eva

1481
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,500
some random woman
that would come to me to tell me:

1482
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,700
"Hey, look at me, are superb


1483
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,400
pays me 2000 per month
and your wife will be for five years. "

1484
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:33,000
I mean, I choose
the two versions ever

1485
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,700
but this is not about money for me.

1486
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,400
That is about love
between my daughter and me.

1487
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,000
Bravo.

1488
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,200
Son, this is a courtroom,
which presents the facts.

1489
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,600
There is a scene for your soap opera
or your director.

1490
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,000
Ms. Judge, I submitted all the evidence,

1491
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,300
but at this point I would like
to add some evidence

1492
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,900
proving that Mrs. Stout
having an affair with Mr. Gallo's,

1493
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,100
who is director of a company
worth 20 million dollars.

1494
01:28:07,135 --> 01:28:09,700
This ... This is a lie.

1495
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:21,600
A friend owns the company
which cleared Ms Stout.

1496
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,700
What has materialized
evidence filed in court.

1497
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,100
Look in the hearing today,

1498
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,100
do not know any infidelity in marriage.

1499
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,800
No more questions
This witness, Ms. judge.

1500
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,800
Feel free, you can descend.

1501
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,900
Tripp is the man with whom you have met
in Las Vegas in this room to court?

1502
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,600
He is.

1503
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,800
What was the nature of your meeting?

1504
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,300
I called the Vegas.

1505
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,200
My plane was delayed,
but we arrived at the club at 9:30 PM.

1506
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,100
We met and we have hot ...

1507
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,200
I went to his hotel
at around 11:00 PM

1508
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,000
where we had sex.

1509
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,000
I even did photos
but we have lost.

1510
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,400
You lose these photos, right?

1511
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,400
Yes.

1512
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:40,300
So someone does not tell the truth.
Either you, or my client.

1513
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,200
Ask me which of you.

1514
01:29:42,235 --> 01:29:43,300
Ms. judge, please ...

1515
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,200
I managed to catch a plane.
You can check.

1516
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,500
Excuse me, Ms. judge.

1517
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,550
For the last time,
Mr. and Miss Backinsale, you ask:

1518
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,700
Are you sure you have slept
my client?

1519
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,400
Yes.

1520
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,200
All right.

1521
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,900
Ms. judge, I want to make
rather than a proof,

1522
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,900
You know what it is.

1523
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,000
<i> "That night" 10:40 am </ i>

1524
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,700

- Quiet!

1525
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,600
Here, in this device, Ms. judge,

1526
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:02,000
are many and interesting photos
of Rowan's Samantha with Mr. Sly.

1527

That and spent the entire evening
My client

1528
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,900
evening in question.

1529
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,900
The first photo is taken at 10:03 PM

1530
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,200
and the 12th and last at 8:05 PM.

1531
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,500
I think you can tell
that means all night, Samantha?

1532
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,000
Ms. judge, where we know
that did not have any technical trick

1533
01:31:23,035 --> 01:31:24,500
and changed its photos?

1534
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,365
Besides, we have evidence
indicating that Dr. Stout

1535
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,600
paid him and Mr. Do Backinsale
two tickets to Las Vegas.

1536
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,900
Show intention. Also, my client,

sue him
demanding full custody ...

1538
01:31:33,885 --> 01:31:35,700
Do not give to my daughter.
Can you take all the money.

1539
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:36,800
Quiet!

1540
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,500
Quietly in the courtroom!

01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,600
That means 16%.

1547
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,300
There will be maintenance for the wife pension,

1548
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,800
pensions and child maintenance
will be calculated according to the law

1549
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,800
18% of your income

over a period of 18 years.

1550
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,600
Both must have care
Your daughter.

1551
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,500
And session is suspended.

1552
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:16,000
- Thanks, David.
- It was my pleasure.

1553
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:20,600
Not bad having regard to the circumstances
and that is my first trial won.

1554
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,900
I'm happy
that we obtained joint custody ...

1555
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,000
What? Excuse me,
just said the first trial won?

1556
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,000
Yes. I'm sorry for that.

1557
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,000
You see, two years ago when I was broker

1558
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,700
I went through the same thing
through which you now

1559
01:32:32,735 --> 01:32:34,200
and then I decided to become a lawyer.

1560
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,000
Same thing ...? Have you divorced?

1561
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,300
- Yes.
- But you told me you're married.

1562
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:43,000
Yes. You know, the whole thing
the Bar, customer ...

1563
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,600
It was a trick of "Shark."
Had to know the whole story from you.

1564
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,400
I think you're really a "shark."

1565
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,200
Tripp, see that statue?

1566
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,600
Lady Justice.

1567
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,700
Is blind, but is a woman.

1568
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:02,900
See ya.

1569
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,400
All right. Would you tell me about Fiona?

1570
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:14,200
If David was not save you
you lost all your money.

1571
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah, I know, I know ...

1572
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,200
Look, I put in something

not supposed to do from the beginning.

1573
01:33:20,235 --> 01:33:21,700
But did I tell about it

1574
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,700
because I knew what you were told.

1575
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,100
You know, to make a deal
still as I could.

1576
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,100
Do not say anything, so I ...

1577
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,400
Tell me what happened.

1578
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,965
After I separated from Eve

1579
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,800
Fiona called me
A few weeks later.

1580
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,100
Yes, come to New York five days.

1581
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,400
We're gonna be in around?

1582

01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,900
No, you know, actually
I move into a new house.

1583
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,500
So I how about this ...

1584
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,800
How about take a trip somewhere?

1585
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,500
I did not want to attract money that we.

1586
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,600
I even changed machine
with a neighbor like to go to see it.

1587
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,665
You live with your parents?

1588
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,300
Yes, living with mother in Los Angeles.

1589
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,100
- It's nice.
- Yes.

1590
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:12,200
You understand that your parents
no longer together?

1591
01:34:12,235 --> 01:34:14,400
- Do not ...
- What is your father?

1592
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,700
I have not seen for two years.

1593
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,100
I bet that even
and no longer remembers me.

1594
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,900
It must have been difficult, you know ...

1595
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,100
You're growing without a father ...

1596
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,600
Yes. Yes, it was, but she was amazing.

1597
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:31,600
He had four children and two jobs.

1598
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,300
And is a super mother.

1599
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,100
But you?

1600
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,700
And you've lost someone?

1601
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,800
My brother when he was seven years ...

1602
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:48,000
Her insurance company refused to pay
a procedure that would have saved lives.

1603
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,700
Sorry to hear that.

1604
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,100
Because of this work
for a company in the field of health?

1605
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,100
I never said everything.

1606
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,900
You just knew that work at a company,
that do not possess one.

1607
01:35:01,935 --> 01:35:05,200
Or that I do not I call Max Stout.

1608
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,600
Hey ...

1609
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,000
You fell asleep as soon as the movie started.

1610
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,800
Well, I did not sleep
too much lately.

1611
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,700
If you want, can I call to my hotel
wonder if having a camera in addition.

1612
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,400

- Yes ...
- Talk on the phone.

1618
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,600
- Right. See ya.
- Okay.

1619
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,100
Yes, but the meeting could be better.

1620
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,400
You know ... However, it was beautiful.

1621
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,500
Wait. What could be better that is?

1622
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,600
Well, you know ...

1623
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,500
Fiona knew that going through a divorce?

1624
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,900
Yes and no. I mean ...

1625
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,300
Every time I went

1626
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:16,100
And, you know ...

1627
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,900
eventually we needed it
was more than she needed me.

1628
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,200
What do you mean you took it
was more than she needed you?

1629
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,600
Well, I was depressed, and she was next
me when I needed it most.

1630
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,300
But one minds ...

1631
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,200
You know, Eve, just as I lay on me.

1632
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,900
So I finally
I decided to tell the truth.

1633
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,600
<i> and Max's trip to Fiona </ i>

1634
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,400

Not only working on it
but possess and sell.

01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,700
You lay?

1638
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,400
Yes, I think I lay ...

1639
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,700
but I went through a ...

1640
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:16,400

1641
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,100
- Divorce?

- Are not you married?
- Technical are married but are separated

1645
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:27,900

Hi ...

1649
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,800
Fiona left me.

1650
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:53,700
I mean had to choose between an honest man
and one with money and he chose the director.

1651
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,700
Imagine you and your.

1652
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,300
My plan so I ...
has turned against me.

1653
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,400
Do you miss her?

1654
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,400
Yes, I miss her.

1655
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:09,900
And I ... I was in a similar situation.

1656
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,600
- Really?
- Yes.

1657
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,200
Yes, remember your a Kate?

1658
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,100
My mother?

1659
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,700
You must choose.

1660
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,500
I'll be me, yours or other options?

1661
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:28,200
I ... scared and we have chosen options.

1662
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,300
Since then, I never met love.

1663
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:38,300
At least ... let me be a father.

1664
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And ah-mat.

1665
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,900
Is a first time for everything, right?

1666
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,100
Listen, if you want You find love
again, you must go after Fiona.

1667
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:53,900
Or you can have all other options.

1668
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Where you going?

1669
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,400
In Los Angeles.

1670
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,400
In "The city of Angels?
You go there without me?

1671
01:39:05,435 --> 01:39:07,017
Women go there for opportunities.

1672
01:39:07,052 --> 01:39:08,600
There is easy-to demonstrate your value.

1673
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,200
Yes ... Sit down.

1674
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,200
You must do this alone this time.

1675
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,200
Fiona, can you to and expecting a second?

1676
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,800
Do you want a chance to explain everything.

1677
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,100
Well, I ruined everything
and I'm very sorry.

1678
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,700
I can do that.

1679
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:47,800
Can you please just listen to me?

1680
01:39:47,835 --> 01:39:49,000
I can ...

1681
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,200
I tried hard ...

1682
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:54,900
do not love you anymore.

1683
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:56,500
And I can not.

1684
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,300
I can not, because they see
you're a nice guy.

1685
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:08,800
Do not understand why the feel that you must be
else than that you are love.

1686
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,800
You know, when you said that day that ...

1687
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000

1688
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:24,000
I have broken my heart.

1689
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,800
Fiona, I'm very sorry.

1690
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:36,400
I think ... I do not know, I forgot
what is real and what is a game.

1691
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:39,900
You know? But this is not a game.

1692
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,700
This is real.

1693
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:49,300
I do not know ... what is real.

1694
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:54,100
Maybe ... maybe we can start again?

1695
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,400
Maybe.

1696
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,500
I do not like games.

1697
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,465
Okay?

1698
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:08,800
