...my wife and I, we ran out of gas
down the road.

Could you give me a lift back to
the station?

It was his left hand.
And I'm telling you it happened.

something about that.

Try and plan your hookups
in room temperature or above.

of a small place.

00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,687
I thought you said these woods
were uninhabited.

163
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,422
As far as I know, they are.

164
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,624
I just saw an old man off the trail.

165
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,092
Oh, that must have been Henry.

166
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,061
Yeah, he used to run the camp
up here years ago.

167
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:39,030
Back when I was a camper.

168
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,565
That was before the Alzheimer's
kicked in.

Uh, no.

172
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,436
Here. Take one of these, will you?

173
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:46,837
Sure.

00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:10,862

I'm sorry.

185
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,740
I lost one of my parents, too.

186
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,208
Yeah?

187
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:26,244
Yeah.

Nah, not tonight.

00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:52,836
I'm a little out of it.

199
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:55,006
I was thinking I might just catch up
on my sleep.

200
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,909
Next time?
- Yeah, next time.

201

Hey, but do you mind if I
check my email?

How do you play?

206
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,538
JASON: Well, the rules are simple.

207
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,542
As in the best of games,
one person is "it."

208
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,310
That person runs off to hide

209
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,779
as the rest of the group waits by home base
and counts till midnight.

210
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,482
1:00, 2:00, 3:00,
etcetera.

211
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,350
At midnight they break off
in separate directions

212
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:42,386
and try to find "it."

213
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,256
Whoever manages to find "it" first,
yells, "Bloody murder."

214
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,324
And everybody runs back to home base.

215
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,993
But if "it" manages to attack anyone

216
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,061
before they reach home base,

217
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,062
that person is "it" next game,

218
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,530
and the whole thing starts over again.

219
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,667
Sounds fun. Let's play.

220
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,869
All right. Well, you need a big group
to make it work.

221
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,238
I'm in.

222
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,373

help me get away from everything.

just made matters worse.

talking in public.

and this morning he's
nowhere to be seen.

been slept in.

Well, yeah.

331
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,987
Then he's probably trying
to scare you.

332
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,888
I wouldn't worry too much about it.

333
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,091
Maybe.

334
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:35,859
Don't you think we should call
the police or something?

00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,527
Whoa.

336
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:41,131
Police can't do anything until he's
been missing at least 24 hours.

337

Look, I'm... I'm sure he'll show up
by dinner time.

338
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,504
If he doesn't, I'll call the Sheriff.

don't let it get to you.

348
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:39,823
Okay. But just until
I say we head back.

349
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,392
You got it.
- Okay.

350
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,355
This is far enough.

351
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:27,271

though, didn't we?

I just wonder if we can work on it some
and...and make it better.

00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:37,714
I mean, I know I can change.
I just...

356
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,984
I just need to feel like
I'm getting the same effort from you.

357
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,752
Dean, I wanna go back.

358
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,155

another shot?

377
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,290
the last time they talked last night,

378
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:29,726
Jason mentioned something about
taking off for a while?

379

about that to you?

Well, what's on
your mind?

532
00:35:00,664 --> 00:35:02,732
I don't know.
(SNIFFLES) Everything.

533
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,101
My mom, Jason.

534
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:08,904
Now Whitney.

535
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:12,975
This summer isn't
exactly turning out
as I expected.

536
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:16,078
Well, is there anything
I could do to help?

537
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,546
You wouldn't
by any chance
have one of those

538
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:19,181
Guam cigarettes on you,
would you?

539
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,549
(LAUGHS)

540
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,085
Actually,
I brought one with me.

541
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,821
Just in case.

542
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,090

You okay?

546
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,640
My father would kill me
if he knew I was doing this.

547
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:47,943
I won't tell
if you won't.

548
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:49,345
(EXHALES)

549
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,516
It just
doesn't seem fair.

550
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,919
Seventeen years.

551
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:58,521
I was just getting
to know her, you know.

552
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:02,124
Yeah. I never got
to meet my dad.

553
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:03,593
He died
before I was born.

554
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,396
Jeez, listen to me.

555
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,998
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

556
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:11,600
Misery comes in lots
of different forms.

557
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:13,236
It's all miserable.

558
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:14,504
(SNIFFLES)

559
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,908
Do you ever
feel cheated?

560
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:21,877
Well, sometimes
I get angry.

561
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,947
I seek out
other people to blame
for my father's death.

562
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,683
My therapist calls it
transference.

563
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,986
It's where
I feel too guilty
to blame him,

564
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,790
so I look out
for other people
to be angry with.

565
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:38,894
(CHUCKLES)

566
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,530
Your toes are beautiful.

567
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:42,064
Thanks.

568

<i>It's called  mehndi.</i>

569
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:46,035
It's a form of
body painting I learned
while living in India.

570
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,904
I can do yours
if you want.

571
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:50,740
I'd like that.

572
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,342
I'm telling you,
I have no idea of
what happened

573
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,210
to Jason and Whitney.

574
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,282
As I said before,

575
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,951
they hooked up
by the lake, the night
that Jason disappeared.

576
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,488
Took off like he said
he was gonna do,

577
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,324
got bored
and came back
for Whitney.

579
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,328
Okay, Dean,

580
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,129
I've got three officers
out there

581
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:16,599
combing the area
for Jason and Whitney
right now.

582
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,868
I've notified
the state police
of the disappearance.

583
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,270
And if they're out there,
we'll find them.

584
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:23,539
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:25,341
I'm gonna have to
hold you overnight.

586
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:33,282

Sorry, I...

593
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:42,418
Ask Tommy McConnell
what really happened
to Nelson that night.

594
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,952
How do you know
my dad's name?

up here named Henry.</i>

(BEEPS)

602
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:25,294
So, what do you guys think
is going on around here
anyway?

603
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:27,830
Simple. I think that Dean
got dumped by Whitney.

604
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,666
He couldn't handle it,
went psycho on her.
End of story.

605
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,935
I've known Dean
a long time.

606
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,505
I don't think
he's capable of
anything like that.

607
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:37,973
I still think
we're overlooking
the obvious here.

608
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,775
And what's that?

609
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:41,744
Trevor Moorehouse
is back for revenge.

610
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,180
Get out of here.

611
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,816
I'm not kidding.
I heard this guy
was real.

612
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,918

Trevor Moorehouse?

whatever it's worth.

615

But my older sister swears
she knows someone

616
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,525
whose brother's friend
disappeared up here

617
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:57,193

during the summer.

Six degrees
of mutilation?

619

There's no such person
as Trevor Moorehouse.

620
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,501
That's what my sister
said she told that guy
a few years ago.

621

he disappeared.

I'm sorry about
the confusion.

648
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:23,399
Yeah, whatever.

649
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,702
Don't get too used
to the idea of
having me around.

650
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:35,177
So, you say that Jason
had a beef with
Brad Thompson.

651
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,578
That's right.

652
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:39,315
Brad was the last person
Jason competed against

653
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:41,616
in track before
he blew his knew out.

654
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:43,018
Jesus!

00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:47,089
Some of these kids
are taking their sports
way too serious today.

656
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,691
Don't worry, Patrick,
we're gonna catch Jason.

657
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:52,361
I've got every officer
in the state working
to make that happen.

658
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,965
Well, that's great.
What shall we do about
the camp in the meantime.

659
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,933
Well, I don't
think you'll have
anymore trouble,

660
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,768
but just in case,

661
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:02,871
I'll put a man
down there on Von Road
across from the arch way.

662
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,508
Anything suspicious,
you just give a holler,
he'll come running.

663
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:06,909
Great.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Sure.

664
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:18,020
What's going on
with the police car
out front?

665
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:19,688
Well, the Sheriff thought
it might be a good idea

666
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:21,590
if somebody kept an eye
on the camp.

667
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:22,958
It's just a precaution.

668
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:24,392
TOBE: Of course,
this is so obvious.

669
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,294
We're at
a sleepover camp.

670
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,429
Naturally, the killer
had to be Jason.

671
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,298
What's he talking about?

672
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,934
Julie, Brad disappeared
earlier today.

673
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,504
The Sheriff thinks
Jason might have had
something to do with it.

674
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:38,641
That's crazy.
I don't believe it.

675
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,343
Well, come on, Julie,
we all saw the look
in his eyes

676
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:43,878
when he discovered
that Brad was up here
for the summer.

677
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:45,514
He was upset.

678
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:48,684
Jason couldn't possibly
do anything to hurt anyone.

679
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,119
Oh, great.
I'm a dead man.

680
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:52,455
The one guy
I pissed off
this summer

681
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:55,558
had to be a psychotic killer
named Jason, no less.

682
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,860
There's got to be
some other explanation.

683
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,795
I hope there is,
believe me.

684
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:03,265
But in the meantime,
we can't be too careful.

685
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,966
Patrick, can I talk
to you alone?

686
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,202
Um, sure.

687
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:10,973
Tobe, why don't you
head back down
to the lake

688
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,308
and make sure
the canoes are secured.

689
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,445
Oh, sure.

690
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:19,515
You know, this is a great time
for me to be walking
to the camp alone.

691
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,749
Why don't you just
paste a sign on my back

692
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,085
that says,
"Please kill next."

693
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,286
Go.

694
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:31,594
Henry said something to me
by the showers yesterday.

695
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:35,430
He said,
"Nelson's come back
to even the score."

696
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:38,367
Then he told me to
ask my dad what really
happened that night.

697
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,436
Do you know
what he's talking about?

698
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,839
No. Henry's sick, Julie.

699
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,343
He doesn't always make
complete sense
as we know it.

700
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,112
I'll tell you what,
I'll go through
the camp archives

701
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,714
and look for this...
Nelson.

702

873
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,241
and I'm here if
you need someone
to talk to.

874
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:51,913
Or perhaps
a rebound relationship.

875
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,081
Thanks, Tobe.
You're a good friend.

876
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,619
"Friend." (SCOFFS)

877
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:14,535
You think she's ready?
Probably.

878
01:01:15,203 --> 01:01:16,604
Wish me luck.

879
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:17,771
Just stay within
the orange markers.

880
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,007
Okay.

881
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:26,147
(LAUGHS)

882
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,959
(CREAKING)

883
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,735
Oh, shit!

884
01:02:23,238 --> 01:02:25,573
Julie!
Are you all right?

885
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:27,975
I think so. Ouch.

886
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,143
I don't understand it.

887
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,913
Tobe and I tested
that rope together.

888
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,581
That's okay,
I'm fine.

889
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,449
What happened?

890
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:37,484
The rope broke,
Julie fell.

891
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,687
It's okay, really,
I'm fine.

892
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:52,600
Doug, have you seen
the tug-of-war rope
around here anywhere?

893
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:55,303
Yeah, I stashed it
in the back office
when we first got up here.

894
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,405
I looked back there.
I couldn't find it.

895
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,208
Hmm. Well,
I'll tell you what.

896
01:03:00,275 --> 01:03:01,575
I'll look for
the tug-of-war rope,

897
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:03,844
you take this stuff
to the picnic area.

898
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:06,014
Deal.
All right? Cool.

899
01:03:08,517 --> 01:03:11,218
Oh, speaking of
lost items...

900
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:13,421
You haven't seen a pair
of black boots laying
around, have you?

901
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:15,723
I misplaced it
the first day
I got up here.

902
01:03:15,524 --> 01:03:17,592
Sorry,
I haven't seen 'em.

903
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,047
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

(GASPING)

907
01:04:54,356 --> 01:04:55,957
Ouch!

908
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,092
I'm sorry.
Is it any better?

909
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,027
(SIGHS) Yeah, a little.

910
01:05:00,095 --> 01:05:02,763
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

911
01:05:07,102 --> 01:05:09,937
It's just a little
something to commemorate
our summer together.

912
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:11,272
It's beautiful.

913
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:12,639
(CHUCKLING) Thanks.

914
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,676
Drew I wanna tell you.

915
01:05:15,743 --> 01:05:17,778
I feel really lucky to
have been partnered
with you.

916
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:19,981
I don't know what
I would have done

917
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,782
these past coupla days
without you.

918
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:22,950
Oh, I'm lucky, too.

919
01:05:23,017 --> 01:05:25,052
Here we are,
five days into the summer

920
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,021
and I already have
a new best friend.

921
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,856
(BOTH LAUGHING)

922
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:30,057
Here.

923
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,969
So, what do you guys think
they're gonna do with Jason?

924
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:43,705
Well, if memory
serves me correctly,

925
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:45,373
they'll probably have to
incinerate him.

926
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,108
And then bury him
in an ancient Indian
burial ground

927
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:50,712
to destroy him.
(LAUGHS)

928
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:53,247
Sheriff Wilson said
they're gonna hold him
for a while,

929
01:05:53,281 --> 01:05:55,249
until Whitney and Brad
show up.

930
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:58,285
Yeah, but I like
my version
a lot better.

931
01:05:58,353 --> 01:06:00,221
Do you think
he did anything to him?

932
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,588
I don't know.

933
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:03,624
At first, I wouldn't
have thought so,

934
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,327
but now
I'm not so sure.

935
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,661
Have you guys
seen Doug today?

936
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:09,130
Yeah, I saw him
about an hour ago.

937
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,264
He was looking
for a pair of shoes

938
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:12,300
he lost up here
the first day.

939
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,301
Any of you guys seen 'em?

940
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:14,635
Not my style.

941
01:06:14,703 --> 01:06:15,703
Haven't seen 'em.

942
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:20,775
Oh, me neither.

943
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,350
Hey, I'm gonna load
the paintball guns.

944
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,186
Anyone care to join me
in a test duel. Huh?

945
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,155
(LAUGHS) Pass.
Thanks.

946
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:35,556
Chicks.

947
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:43,631
Hey, Jewels,
how's your knee?

948
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,266
It's much better.
Good.

949
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:46,567
(CAR APPROACHING)

950
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,738
Dad?
(CHUCKLES)

951
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,980
Hey!
Hey.

952
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:01,548
Oh.

953
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:02,716
What are you
doing here?

954
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:04,051
I got your messages
last night

955
01:07:04,118 --> 01:07:05,319
when I didn't
hear from you, well...

956
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:06,554
Hi.

957
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:08,955
You must be Julie's dad.

958
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:10,390
I've heard a lot
about you.

959
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,625
Dad, this is Drew Zemke.

960
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:13,127
Drew's my partner
for this summer.

961
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,129
Oh, hi, Drew.
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

962
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:16,897
Nice to meet you.

963
01:07:16,965 --> 01:07:19,567
So, Julie tells me
you used to be
a counselor up here.

964
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:22,070
About 100 years ago.

965
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:23,137
Well, couldn't have
been that long ago.

966
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,772
Patrick!

967
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:27,508
Come meet my dad.

968
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,443
Hi, I'm Patrick.
I'm Tom.

969
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:30,777
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

970
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,513
Um, Julie,
have you seen
my camper's list?

971
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:34,882
I've... I've looked
everywhere.

972
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,083
Well, I have a copy
in my cabin.

973
01:07:36,151 --> 01:07:37,251
Let me get it for you.

974
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,652
Great, thanks.

975
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,520
Take care.
Nice talking to you.

976
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:42,556
Duty calls.

977
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,795
Julie, do you want me
to get it for you?

978
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:50,298
I'd better go.
It's under a bunch
of things.

979
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:52,733
Hey! Why don't you
show my dad around?

980
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,501
I'll meet you guys
at the lake in 20?

981
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:55,770
Are you sure?

982
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:57,071

to explain.

Yeah, I saw him with Drew,
they were heading
to the lake.

Who's Nelson Hammond?

1013
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:22,175
Walking around these woods
must bring back a lot
of memories for you.

Yeah, sort of.

1015
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:27,047
My dad was a counselor
at the same time
you were up here.

1016

Really?
Uh-huh.

1017
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:30,517
What's your
father's name?
Bill Anderson.

1018
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:32,319
Bill Anderson?

1019
01:11:32,386 --> 01:11:35,155
Wow. That's a name
I haven't heard in ages.

1020
01:11:35,823 --> 01:11:37,724
How's he doing?

1021
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,526
He died.

1022
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:41,295

Any sign of 'em?

1025

No, sir. Drew said
they were heading
down to the lake

1026
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:15,863
and when I told Julie that,
she went after 'em.

1027
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,497
All right. Billy,
I want you to go around
east side of the lake.

1028
01:12:17,565 --> 01:12:19,333
I'll take the west.

1029
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,802
Tobe, I want you and Jason
to gather everybody else
in the camp.

1030
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,338
As of this moment,
this camp is officially
closed for summer.

1031

changed one bit.

DREW: I love it here.

1034
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,881
Is this where
we're supposed
to meet Julie?

1035
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:36,650
Yeah. She should be
down here any minute.

1036
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:39,452
The girls are
really gonna love her.

1037
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,155
She's just the type
to have the magic touch.

1038
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:42,690
Yeah.

1039
01:12:42,757 --> 01:12:45,092
I guess she got that
from her mother.

1040
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:46,293
Well, from what
Julie tells me,

1041
01:12:46,361 --> 01:12:47,961
she sounded like
an amazing woman.

1042
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,331
Yeah. Well...

1043
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:58,738
You really should
check out the view
from the end of the dock.

1044
01:12:58,773 --> 01:13:00,441
It's extraordinary.

1045
01:13:01,442 --> 01:13:03,043
Oh, after you.

1046
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:51,525
You looking for somebody?

1047
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,594
Oh. Hi.

1048
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,462
I didn't see you.

1049
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,097
Where's my dad?

1050
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:59,066
He's waiting for us
down by the docks.

1051
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:19,586
That's strange.

1052
01:14:19,654 --> 01:14:21,454
He was here
when I left.

1053
01:14:23,624 --> 01:14:25,425
Drew!

1054
01:14:25,493 --> 01:14:27,027
What did you do
with my father?

1055
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:29,529
Nothing.
He was standing
right here when I left.

1056
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:31,564
Drew!

1057
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:34,635
I know!

1058
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,203
You know what?

1059
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,271
I know your father
was Bill Anderson.

1060
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,607
So?

1061
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:43,077
"So?" I know
what you're doing.

1062
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:44,411
I know how
you killed them.

1063
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:46,513
And you were
probably going
to kill me.

1064
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:48,148
What are you
talking about?

1065
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:50,584
Your father was murdered
by Nelson Hammond.

1066
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,353
You seek out others
to blame for his death?

1067
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:55,856
Transference! I know.

1068
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,958
Julie, turn around.

1069
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,592
Where's my dad?

1070
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,328
Turn around.

1071
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,897
I'm not turning around
until you tell me
where my father is.

1072
01:15:04,432 --> 01:15:05,699
Look!

1073
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:08,235
(SCREAMS)

1074
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:14,441
Get away from him.

01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:21,649
Jump!

1081
01:16:00,855 --> 01:16:02,756
Patrick!
I'm over here.

1082
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:05,859
He's over there
by the dock!

1083
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:07,527
He's got Drew.
All right, all right.

1084
01:16:07,595 --> 01:16:08,795
Let's get you
safe first.

1085
01:16:08,863 --> 01:16:10,597
Patrick, I'll be fine.
We've got to help Drew.

1086
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:12,733
I'm afraid nothing
can help Drew now.

1087
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,900
What are you
talking about?

1088
01:16:13,968 --> 01:16:15,636
I mean,
she's dead, Julie.

1089
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,671
There's nothing
I or anybody can do.

1090
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:18,972
How do you know
she's dead?

1091
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:23,944
Because I killed her,
Julie.

1092
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,581
Just like I killed
your father.

1093
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,149
Yeah.

1094
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,551
Just like I killed
your friends.

1095
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,186
Just like
I'm gonna kill you.

1096
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:36,189
What?
Oh, yeah.

1097
01:16:36,257 --> 01:16:38,158
They treated me awful
20 years ago.

1098
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:40,560
And for that
they have to pay.

1099
01:16:40,628 --> 01:16:42,963
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

1100
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,264
Patrick,
I don't understand.

1101
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:46,834
"Patrick,
I don't understand."

1102
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:50,337
I'm sorry, you have me
confused with someone
named Patrick.

1103
01:16:51,672 --> 01:16:54,441
That wouldn't be
that Patrick, would it?

(SCREAMS)

1105
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:01,114
Tell me something, Julie.

1106
01:17:01,182 --> 01:17:03,684
Have you ever played
Bloody Murder?

1107
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:06,720
You're Nelson Hammond.

1108
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,821
Oh, very good.
(CHUCKLES)

1109
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:11,158
You kids today,
you think your computers,

1110
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:13,527
and your telephones,
and your email

1111
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:15,963
can keep you safe
in the woods?

1112
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:18,165
Well, let this be
a lesson to you, Julie.

1113
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:20,200
Email could
be intercepted.

1114
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,402
And it's not
always considered
Internet worthy news

1115
01:17:22,469 --> 01:17:24,104
when they let you out,

1116
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,006
as it is when
they lock you up.

1117
01:17:26,674 --> 01:17:27,774
Say, "Bye-bye."

1118
01:17:27,842 --> 01:17:29,476

You're not playing
by the rules, McConnell.

You have to
yell, "Bloody murder."

It's okay, everybody.

1134
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,369
The Sheriff arrested Drew
by the lake.

1135
01:20:09,436 --> 01:20:10,270
Now, Julie was hit
in the head.

1136
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,772
She's got
a mild concussion.

1137
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:13,807
I need to take her
to the hospital.

1138

Jason, do something.

1139
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,509
He's the killer!

1140
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:17,911
It's okay, Julie,
it's over.

1141
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,346
Just do what
Patrick says.

1142
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,081
Get in the car, Julie.

1143
01:20:22,516 --> 01:20:24,150
Somebody believe me.

1144
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,686
He's Nelson Hammond.

you're talking to, Tobe.

01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,360
It's me, Patrick.

I'll meet you
at the hospital.

01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:19,806
And then tomorrow
we can go home.

I would have warned you.

but I think
I'm all right.

to deal with some
unresolved issues

about my father's death.

1163

And in a weird way,
I... I guess you could
say I did.

1164

I guess I just didn't
expect it to be
so literal.

Is it strange to say
I'm happy for you?

in a backward way

1177

why you killed
Whitney and Brad
and Dean.

you're a jerk at all.

take the risk of doing
what you did for me.

Yeah, well, don't let that
influence your decision

to sleep with me.
