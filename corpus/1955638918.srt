1
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,064
<i>Los Angeles.
City of Angels, land of dreams.</i>

2
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,098
This is my town.

3
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>Gorgeous girls, golden sunshine</i>

4
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,035
and money.

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
<i>Lots and lots of money.</i>

6
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,808
<i>The Statue of Liberty may ask
for your tired and your hungry,</i>

7
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,611
<i>but on Rodeo Drive,</i>

8
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,947
all we really want
is your black card.

9
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,048
<i>Every power player, CEO</i>

10
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,817
<i>and A-lister in the world
wants a piece</i>

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,685
of the tinsel-covered
Hollywood dirt.

12
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:56,990
And L.A.'s got the estates
to make their wet dreams a reality.

13
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,960
<i>From blue ocean to elite hills,</i>

14
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:02,293
<i>L.A.'s got it all.</i>

15
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,932
So, who am I?

16
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,002
Well, when Moroccan monarchs,
Tokyo tycoons

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,370
<i>and Wall Street raiders
waltz into town,</i>

18
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,105
I'm the man
who makes it happen.

19
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,408
Woodman. Jack Woodman.

20
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,044
Welcome to your new home.

21
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,850
My God, this place is gorgeous.

22
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:27,021
Mr. Payman.
Mwah, mwah.

23
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,224
So, what do we think?

24
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,662
This would go
for half the price back in Toledo.

25
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,062
I think it's too much,

26
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,164
which explains why
it hasn't been sold yet.

27
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,834
Do not be intimidated
by the price.

28
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,736
Now, who wants to
go on a little tour?

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,106
This house is hotter
than the flash in your tie.

30
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,742
Got three offers
on it already, my man.

31
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,042
Are they written or verbal?

32
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,013
Scott, we both know
talk is cheap.

33
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,149
You are going to lose
your dream palace over here

34
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,951
by being penny-wise
and dollar-foolish.

35
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,921
Maybe we should place an offer.

36
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,023
Smart.

37
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,091
What's the highest offer?

38
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,697
What do you mean
it's selling for 6.5 million?

39
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,996
What?

40
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,097
We got outbid.

41
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,301
We were almost in escrow, man!
I could feel it!

42
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,069
<i>I'm telling you, man,
they countered!</i>

43
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,040
No. I can't go any higher.
Papa said no more.

44
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,043
We take it back.
We can get this.

45
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,912
All right. I'm going to put
my paws on the table, okay?

46
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,663
Yes. Come on.

47
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:27,412
Yeah!

48
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,815
Yeah! Yeah!

49
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,150
Don't worry about
Emily and Scott.

50
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:33,787
I'll find them an equally
expensive property

51
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,723
before you can even say
"open house".

52
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,057
God bless their hearts, though.

53
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,961
<i>Their timely counter-offer
sure made Payman pay up.</i>

54
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,465
After all,
it's not real friends.

55
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,965
It's real estate.

56
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,036
Whether it's Bel Air
at $1,000 a foot

57
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,471
or West Hollywood
at 10 grand a month,

58
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,340
in this game,
you have to be ruthless.

59
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,477
But to be great, we got to play
by the exceptions,

60
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,944
not the rules.

61
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,847
That's where I reign supreme.

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,281
I am the gray zone master.

63
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:05,118
I do what's necessary
to close the deal.

64
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:14,995
Subrip by DanDee

65
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,298
<i>The end of 2008.</i>

66
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,499
<i>A lot of people
hit rock-bottom this year.</i>

67
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,370
<i>Well. Too bad for them.</i>

68
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,972
<i>Recession?
Credit crisis?</i>

69
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,941
<i>Subprime mortgage default?</i>

70
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:30,109
<i>These words don't exist
in the Woodman handbook.</i>

71
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,312
<i>In my world, the party goes on.</i>

72
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:36,115
<i>Champagne, caviar,
naked beauties by the pool.</i>

73
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,819
<i>And everyone wishing
they were me.</i>

74
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,989
Jack, employee of the month.

75
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,856
More like employee of the year.

76
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,793
<i>I was 29 years old.</i>

77
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,862
<i>Set for life.</i>

78
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,563
Congrats, Jack.

79
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,766
Don't you know it,
Janey.

80
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,569
So I told the guy
my name's Aaron Glass.

81
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,406
Don't you know who my dad is?

82
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,475
Nice tits, babe.

83
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:07,980
Skank.

84
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,026
Mind if I join you,
boss?

85
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,193
How you doing?

86
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,529
Warrior Woodman.

87
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,132
Done good, my boy.

88
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,135
Tonight, we celebrate
your home run.

89
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,236
Tomorrow,

90
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,338
we can give Aaron another shot.

91
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,908
Look, Ron,
the fact that he's your son

92
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,443
means he's got
my automatic respect.

93
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:40,346
But the fact is,
he's just not a team player.

94
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,481
Which is cool. Some people
like to operate solo.

95
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,250
Not on this.

96
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:47,887
We both know only you
can take this to the next level.

97
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,090
<i>No mistakes this time.</i>

98
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,061
You just make sure
you're on top of this.

99
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,063
You got it.

100
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,399
I need you to keep him sharp.

101
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,367
Knock-knock.

102
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,205
We were looking for you.

103
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,174
What are you doing in here?

104
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,311
You and my dad
have a nice chat?

105
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,079
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

106
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,048
Once you start taking
control of yourself

107
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,918
and getting the hang
of this real estate deal,

108
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,355
you are going
to make a killing.

109
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,354
Okay?

110
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,057
Your dad and I are just here

111
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,492
to help you put the pieces
back together after...

112
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,559
I know, I know, I know.

113
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,030
After I pissed
on the Miami deal,

114
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,633
<i>crashed the Ferrari,</i>

115
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,033
<i>did two stints in rehab.</i>

116
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:39,538
But all that's
behind you now.

117
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,143
All you got to do is work
a little harder, Aaron.

118
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,212
Pretty soon, you'll be
company front man.

119
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,317
You sure can sell, Woodman.

120
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,322
Anderson, do you mind?

121
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,222
Yeah.

122
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,992
See you, Anderson.

123
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,094
I think that means we should be
getting back to the party.

124
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,997
I mean, it really is amazing.

125
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,032
Go from an orphan kid,

126
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,269
this drunk daddy, dead mommy,

127
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,172
with just a GED,

128
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,540
to the creme de la creme.

129
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,910
Top shelf.

130
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,346
Bravo, Jack.

131
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,516
Not all of us
are born lucky, pal.

135
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,682
Compliments of REG.

136
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,050
Take it easy, ladies.

137
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,685
Isn't it a weeknight?

138
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:01,387
Tomorrow, we rest.

139
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,125
Tonight, we play.

140
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,458
Well...

141
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,197
If you insist.

142
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,530
We do.

143
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,799
Hoo!
Yeah.

144
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,478
<i>This housing
crash is quickly escalating</i>

00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,482
<i>And I don't think

<i>that is not affected...</i>

148
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,552
Payman, did I not tell you
you'd enjoy the new digs?

149
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,021
Who loves you?

150
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,258
So sorry, Tom.

151
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,663
You and I.
Cut everyone out.

152
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,465
Perfect, all right.

153
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,233
Thank you, Janey.

154
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,566
Hey, cheer up, will you?

155
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,237
The moment we close
this Chen deal,

156
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:56,543
we got everything we need
to launch Woodman Plaza.

157
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,214
So, what's Woodman Plaza?

158
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:04,383
<i>Imagine the finest

My favorite pastime.

175
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,523
Now, did we hear back
from that offer we made?

176
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,492
Didn't want to rain
on your parade,

177
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,360
but we got outbid.

178
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,163
Outbid?

179
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,365
Son of a bitch.

180
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,301
Can't win them all, boss.

181
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,302
I just needed to win that one.

182
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,772
That would have been
a dream lot for my baby.

183
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,195
Something bigger and brighter
is just around the corner.

184
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,673
-You'll see.
-You think it's karma?

185
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:06,413
Well, speaking of karma,
Chen's people emailed.

186
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,447
The money's wired,
and he's ready to close.

187
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,249
I guess that means
you should start picking out

188
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,550
your next vacation spot.

189
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,453
Don't forget,

190
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:16,155
<i>Aaron's speech is on
in five minutes</i>

191
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,457
<i>and rumor has it he's got
a magic strategy</i>

192
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,191
that's going to flip
this downturn on its head.

193
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,197
Foreclosures.

194
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,599
Repossessed properties.

195
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,634
The worst economic time
since the Great Depression.

196
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,538
Bad news for some.

197
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,141
Great news for us.

198
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,875
Now, our longtime friends
at the bank

199
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,477
have given us privileged access

200
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,214
to the best upside-down
properties out there.

201
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,887
Here we have an unfinished
10-story luxury condo building,

202
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,354
worth 200 million.

203
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,458
Ready to nab for 60.

204
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,860
This couldn't be built
for less than 140 million,

205
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,464
but it's all yours for 60.

206
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,232
Last but certainly not least,

207
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,700
my personal favorite,

208
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,939
a shabby rent-controlled
rat hole in downtown.

209
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,240
Or as I like to refer to it as,

210
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,342
the "serendipitous slum".

211
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,478
<i>Now don't be fooled
by appearances.</i>

212
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,813
<i>This may be the most valuable
one of them all.</i>

213
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,682
We can turn this gangbanger haven...

214
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,385
<i>into a world-class city center.</i>

215
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,788
Hotels, restaurants,
multiplexes.

216
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,225
So, while everyone else
is declaring bankruptcy,

217
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,259
let's put some coin
in that piggy bank,

218
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,395
and cement REG

219
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,298
as the world's premier
property agency.

220
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,631
Thank you.

221
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,269
Thank you.

222
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,141
Jeff, Alex,
this is Jack Woodman.

223
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,059
Nice to meet you.

224
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,774
Pleasure.

225
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:47,413
He and Aaron are the stars
of the show around here.

226
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,248
How's the deal going
with the Shanghai group?

227
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,514
Just wrapping up.

228
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,718
I enjoyed the presentation,
by the way.

229
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,320
Very theatrical.

230
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,021
Gentlemen.

231
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:03,628
And?

232
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,997
What are your thoughts
on the meeting?

233
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,567
Jack Woodman.

234
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,406
Hey, Jane, I think I hear
a pot of coffee boiling.

235
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,944
You have been
doing your homework.

236
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,713
Listen,
I just stopped by

237
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,982
to say cheers on the Chinese deal.

238
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,586
And I hear the chump didn't even
have to check his fortune cookie

239
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,918
before transferring the dough.

240
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,389
Congratulations.

241
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,591
Still into that derogatory humor,
aren't you?

242
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,427
But your sources are accurate.

243
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,495
Another one bites the dust.

244
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,600
Cheers.

245
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,311
Thanks for stopping by, Aaron.

246
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,644
You forgot this.

247
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,547
You know, if you play nice,

248
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,666
I may just let you in
on a few of these bargains.

249
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,444
What's up, dogs?

250
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:42,027
Mr. Mousian.

251
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,396
It's Jack Woodman.

252
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,798
We spoke on the phone.

253
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,600
Your company already
made me an offer.

254
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,071
And I'm here to make you
a better one, my friend.

255
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,440
REG wants to buy you off cheap.

256
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,341
Throw you out on the street,

257
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,344
flip this place for a fortune.

258
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,710
I'll at least find a way
to pull out

259
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,947
some long-term equity
for you, buddy.

260
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,550
All you sharks are alike.

261
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,420
That's who swims best
in rough waters, my man.

262
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,592
Yeah, they do.

263
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,365
Please, you can call me Moussy.

264
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,067
Hey, get up, man.
Your fucking mother is going to come.

265
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,070
<i>Hey, senora.
Renta, por favor.</i>

266
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,704
Go, go.

267
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,604
Nice ass?

268
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,707
I thought so, too.
I thought so, too.

269
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,807
Hey!

270
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,611
This place is worse
than a fucking Turkish prison.

271
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,096
Why you want it?

272
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,450
Look, Moussy, you've clearly
earned yourself

273
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:40,119
a well-deserved retirement
in...

274
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,988
Glendale, right?

275
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,789
No, I prefer Pasadena.

276
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,826
Perfect. With the crash,
Pasadena's going at $500 a foot.

277
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,864
Look, the point is that
your new home

278
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,999
is wrapped up in the sale
of this dump.

279
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,701
What about all the people
that call this place home?

280
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,638
You can't change
their fates, okay?

281
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,173
They chose their paths.

282
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,845
But you and I can do something
about ours right now.

283
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,950
How much is that?

284
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:14,052
Enough for a down payment
on the Pasadena palace.

285
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,923
This here says that you're
pulling out of the deal with REG.

286
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:21,593
Once this place is in my hands,
it'll be resurrected

287
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:24,430
into the hotel
of the millennium.

288
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,166
And guess who's going
to get himself

289
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,033
some preferred stock shares.

290
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,436
You, Moussy.

291
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,137
All you got to do

292
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,441
is sign right here,

293
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,644
and we go home winners, my man.

294
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:41,047
You know, where we come from,
we shake before we sign.

295
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,822
Tommy boy, you busy?

296
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,159
I got something big.

297
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,076
Tommy boy.

298
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,076
Jack!

299
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,480
The king has returned.

300
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,081
I'm back, baby.

301
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,584
Look at you.

302
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,617
You been working out?

303
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,651
A little bit.

304
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,521
-Jesus.
-All for you. You like that?

305
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,720
I hear you hired a maid.

306
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,854
Yeah.
You can tell, right?

307
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,225
A little bit.

308
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,093
God,
that thing is flatter than my ex.

309
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:28,926
Ouch.

310
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,263
So how come you only see me when you
need something, Jack?

311
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,599
You know I call when I can.

312
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,066
Jack, you're so charming.

313
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,933
If I didn't just blow my wad
on the finest midget porn

314
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,801
that the Internet has to offer,
I'd be swooning.

315
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,303
-Yeah.
-Seriously. I know, right?

316
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:41,607
Well, before we get
all hot and bothered, my man,

317
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,810
I need to ask you
for a little favor.

318
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,212
Here we go.

319
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,514
The MLS.

320
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,714
Seriously?

321
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,048
Yeah.
Not again, dude.

322
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,852
I need you to wipe out
a listing for me.

323
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,232
You fricking
real estate agents,

324
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,724
always try sneaking in
the back door, don't you?

325
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,059
Come on, baby.
Show me some love.

326
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:02,962
All right, man.

327
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,061
All right.

328
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,163
I'll do it, but I'm going to need to
double-check the cheese this time.

329
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:09,101
<i>Some fuck face decided to pay me
in Monopoly bills the other day.</i>

330
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,936
Yeah.

331
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,072
Jeez, feels genuine to me.

332
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,941
That's 'cause you don't
know any better.

333
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,943
But I'm ready to make
some magic happen.

334
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,044
So what do you say?

335
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:20,644
Are you ready
to get this party started?

336
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,697
Absolutely.

337
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:22,998
Like rock stars, baby.

338
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,118
Janey.

339
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,419
Jack.

340
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,304
What?

341
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,338
We have a problem.

342
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,007
Okay, I'm coming.

343
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,115
Everyone's going crazy.

344
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,315
They're in your office, Jack.

345
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,817
And Chen's coming
from Shanghai.

346
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,054
It's not true, is it?

347
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,956
Ron, why...

348
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,091
You got something to tell me?

349
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,794
What are we talking about, Ron?

350
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,861
We're talking about
how the chump's wire transfer

351
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,129
ended up in your bank account.

352
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,801
Now, we both know that the Chen deal
was coming in today.

353
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,037
The money did come in.

354
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,573
It just didn't come
to my doorstep.

355
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,710
Is this some sort of a joke?

356
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,177
Does it look like I'm smiling?

357
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:30,216
The funds were being sent
right here, Ron.

358
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,151
Look, let me just make
a few phone calls,

359
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,020
and I'll clear this right up,
all right?

360
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,959
<i>? I got you, boy
And now you're in my grid</i>

361
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:42,928
<i>? Look what you done
And don't give me lip</i>

362
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,263
Chen's here.

363
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:50,703
<i>? I got your money
I know I got your card?</i>

364
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,709
Your money is safe, sir.
I can assure you that.

365
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:00,913
Mr. Chen is positive
his assistant sent funds as directed.

366
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:02,245
Where is
Mr. Chen's money?

367
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,816
Simple misunderstanding.

368
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:05,848
Somebody must have sent it
to the wrong account...

369
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,123
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

370
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,093
this is just one simple
miscommunication.

371
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,663
We did no wrong.
The deal is off.

372
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,030
We want our money back,

373
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,899
or we are taking legal action.

374
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,018
Fellas, fellas, this is one big
miscommunication.

375
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,037
What now, Jack?

376
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,269
Ron,

377
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,406
how long
have you known me?

378
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,109
Never once have I made
a misstep.

379
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,812
This is just some huge
misunderstanding.

380
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,881
I have no idea
what this is right now.

381
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,817
Well, maybe you have an idea
about what this is.

382
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,218
This document links
Mr. Woodman

383
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:43,056
to the serendipitous
slum project that's in our portfolio.

384
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,424
This is bullshit, Ron.
This is bullshit.

385
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,894
Don't listen to a word
he's saying, Ron.

386
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:47,925
Jack snuck in.

387
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,163
And he bought
the property for himself.

388
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,162
-Ron, he is manipulating you.
-Do you know what

389
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,199
-fiduciary responsibility is, Jack?
-He is manipulating you.

390
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,547
This is fabricated information.

391
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:57,903
You used inside company info

392
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,405
to cheat us out of
a property that I found.

393
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,308
What were you going to do?
Flip it?

394
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,911
Pocket all that cash?

395
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,413
Perhaps put it towards
that little hotel pipe dream?

396
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,015
You see, Dad?

397
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,918
He's been working
for himself all along,

398
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,831
-just like I told you.
-Ron, look at me.

399
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:19,692
Ron, under our contract,
I'm allowed to do my own deals.

400
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,764
Security, have Mr. Woodman's
desk cleared

401
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,166
and please escort him out.

402
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,936
I treated you like a son.

403
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,940
I gave you permission
to screw everybody.

404
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,241
Everybody but me.

405
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,758
I always wanted
a room with a view.

406
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,865
You clever little rat.

407
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,966
You got my bank details,

408
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,269
forwarded Chen's cash there.

409
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,339
Dangling the little
slum building yesterday.

410
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,075
Your presentation.

411
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,011
You set me up.

412
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,980
All I did was bait the trap.

413
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,250
You didn't have to
grab the cheese.

414
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,094
<i>? You a hustler You a hustler</i>

415
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,262
<i>? Trying to rise to the top
But you a bust</i>

416
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,565
<i>? Stealing from the goldmine
as if you're King Tut</i>

417
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:36,034
<i>? And making shady deals

418
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,237

419

421
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,245
<i>? And making shady deals

422
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,536
What's up, man?
How you been?

423
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,337
All right, good to see you.

424
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,312
Wood?

425
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,548
Why are the lights off?
It's the middle of the day.

426
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,884
What is it, Billy?

427
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,189
We got to look at the radiator

428
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,322
and make sure there's still
hot water running through it.

429
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:32,892
Tomorrow, man.
We'll do that tomorrow.

430
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,491
I already collected
most of the rent checks,

431
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:35,927
except 403.

432
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,194
They won't open up.

433
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,031
403 isn't paying rent?

434
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,602
You know that the only reason

435
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,938
that I let you and your grandma

436
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,874
stay here for half-price...

437
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,582
You're supposed to take care
of the dirty work for me.

438
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,516
Remember?

439
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:58,449
Yeah.

440
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,888
You only come to me
with the big stuff.

441
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,891
I will. Everyone's...

442
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,525
-Man!
-Hey, turn that off.

443
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,460
God.

444
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,761
Come on, man!

445
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,336
Wait, 403 isn't the one with...

446
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,971
Yeah. That's the one.

447
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,716
Maybe they're not home.

448
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,028
This is Mr. Cabron.

449
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,997
I'm sorry to interrupt
whatever's going on here.

450
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,134
But I just wanted to remind you

451
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,136
that today
is a very special day,

452
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,673
because it's the first.

453
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,275
Everyone knows
that the first is...

454
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,544
Rent day.

455
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,284
I can take it in installments,

456
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,185
if that works better for you.

457
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,295
Open up!

458
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:20,266
You're late
on last month's rent.

459
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,737
It's real simple.

460
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,672
If nobody pays rent,

461
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:28,173
the banks come in,

462
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,310
check on all the tenants.

463
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:36,382
And then your ass
goes back to the slammer, homey.

464
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,848
<i>Comprende?</i>

465
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,319
Yeah, don't move, all right?

466
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,189
<i>And don't be calling me
homey, either, ese.</i>

467
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,322
That's a privilege.

468
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,758
Where'd you learn that word?

469
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,128
Tell you what.

470
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,229
That's to cover a little bit
of the rent for now.

471
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,598
But check this out.

472
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,001
Any of the people here
in this apartment complex

473
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,570
give you a problem,
come see me.

474
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,206
Me and the homeys,
we'll take care of it, all right?

475
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,342
Just consider me, security.

476
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,545
Cool? You guys have
a nice day.

477
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,450
Yo, that was sick, Wood.

478
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,352
Hope you're taking notes, kid.

479
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,618
So are you coming
to dinner tonight?

480
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,354
-No, man. I don't want...
-Come on, man.

481
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,156
Granny's making her special.

482
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,463
Grandma.

483
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,307
Not yet.
First we have to say grace.

484
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,641
Why don't you do us
the honor, Wood?

485
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,442
I haven't said grace
in a long time, Billy.

486
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,212
I did it
the last time.

487
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,282
All right, let's do it.

488
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,119
Dear Lord,

489
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,789
please bless this
egg and cheese sandwich.

490
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,658
And the hash brown, of course.

491
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,294
We can't forget the coleslaw.

492
00:24:55,326 --> 00:25:00,098
And thank you
for good company this evening.

493
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,268
Amen.

494
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,668
Amen.

Yeah, we're from

522

What's a line, Wood?

529
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,392
It's pronounced "lien".

530
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,196

00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,557
Fuck off, Jack.

535
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:40,830
Still banging with those midgets?

536
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,432
You look like shit.

537
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,968
It's good to see you, too,
buddy. I missed you.

538
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,537
I've heard some stories, man.

539
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,604
You're blacklisted, bro.

540
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:56,709
I've actually just been
on vacation.

541
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,777
Where at? Afghanistan?

542
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,713
Look, Tommy boy, as much as
I love catching up,

543
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,014
I...

544
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,451
I actually stopped by
to ask you for a little something.

545
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,686
What now, man?

546
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,422
Hot watch properties.

547
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,991
I know you got some.

548
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,461
Decent equity.
Small mortgage.

549
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,793
Some value left in them.

550
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,998
You know, I can
still work that angle,

551
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,732
even with
the old license rev...

552
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,701
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

553
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,870
Look, we both know that half the
shit I do is illegal, okay, man?

554
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:29,307
The law doesn't scare me
as much as the fucking REG, man.

555
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,441
Aaron would kill me, bro.

556
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,876
He would never find out.

557
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,345
Bullshit.

558
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,746
If this is about money,

559
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,481
you know I'm good for it.

560
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,318
Remember?
Remember?

561
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,919
I remember, Jack.

562
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:42,387
Throw me a bone.

563
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,423
Anything?

564
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,759
Whatever you got.

565
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,092
Just...

566
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,596
I get it. I get it.

567
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:56,269
Fucking damn it.

568
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,503
Jack.

569
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:08,513
Payman. Buddy.

570
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,516
Remember me? It's Jack.

571
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,848
Hello?

572
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,423
Yeah, Scott, Scott, Scott.
How's Emily?

573
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,690
<i>How'd you get my number?</i>

574
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,891
Yeah, you guys still
looking around?

575
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,593
<i>-You're kidding, right?
-You're not.</i>

576
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,961
You ever find that house?

577
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,230
<i>Yeah, we bought two, asshole.</i>

578
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:25,981
You did!

579
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:26,730
<i>Yeah.</i>

580
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,649
Fantastic.

581
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,699
<i>Fuck you.</i>

582
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,402
Yeah, hello.
This is Jack Woodman.

583
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:32,538
I actually got word
that you have a property

584
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,570
<i>that you're possibly
interested in liquidating.</i>

585
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,108
<i>And it's your lucky day,</i>

586
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,010
<i>because if anybody knows how
to flip a property in this town...</i>

587
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:41,946
it's Jack Woodman.

588
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,449
I'll hold. That's right.

589
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,518
The Jack Woodman. Thank you.

590
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,594
Hey, check this one out, Wood.

591
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,365
You like fast cars?

592
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,366
Beats the bus.

593
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,735
My dad used to tell me,

594
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,403
you want to
get somewhere in life,

595
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,837
you got to have
the right wheels.

596
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,675
Where is he now?

597
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,583
Sorry.
Shouldn't have asked.

598
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,451
My granny said
he went on a trip.

599
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:22,387
I waited for him to come back.

600
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,657
And?

601
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,060
I guess he got
a one-way ticket.

602
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,697
Anyway, Granny's all I got.

603
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,867
What about your folks?

604
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,437
Well, believe it or not,
I grew up in a place

605
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,038
not too different than this.

606
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,723
Really?

607
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:43,375
Well, not this shitty.

608
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,544
But, you get the point.

609
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:48,646
Mom died when I was four.

610
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,980
So it was just Dad and me.

611
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,519
He was the "work late,
drink later" type.

612
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,421
You know, yell, hit, pass out.

613
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,122
Think Homer Simpson
without the comedy.

614
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,758
What happened to him?

615
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,627
So he's in the hospital
with liver failure

616
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,630
by the time I get my GED.

617
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,731
So I get the damn
diploma finally,

618
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:10,536
and I say, "Yes, I did it!"
Fricking ecstatic.

619
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,870
So I go over to the hospital.

620
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:16,208
I say, "Look, Dad.
Look what I did.

621
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,843
"I'm a man now".

622
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,175
And you know what
he says to me?

623
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:20,545
What?

624
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,448
"Take that
and wipe your ass with it.

625
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,451
"Only two things count
in this world,

626
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:30,522
<i>"cash and cojones".</i>

627
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,628
And that was the last thing
he ever said to me before he died.

628
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,769
Imagine how cool the dude
who drives this baby feels.

629
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,573
I know the feeling.

630
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,942
Trust me, I do.

631
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,178
Hey, Wood.
Where do you like it better?

632
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,647
Here, or where
you used to live?

633
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,484
Do you have to ask?

634
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,552
I know this ain't
Beverly Hills,

635
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,587
but to me, it's home.

636
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,891
All right, kid.
It's bedtime.

637
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,562
Hey, Billy.

638
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,895
Thanks for stopping by.

639
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,700
Good night, Woodman.

640
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,710
-Jack.
-What is it, Billy?

641
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,913
It's Mrs. Kinda.
Her place is flooding.

642
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,880
Just tell Mrs. Kinda
I'll be around friggin' later, man.

643
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,550
Come on, man.
She needs you now.

644
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,955
I'll go get some towels.

645
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,661
And some air freshener.

646
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,497
Do you want to give it a try?

647
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,682
It's going down!

648
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,717
It's going down the toilet!
Good job!

649
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,555
Good job! That's it!

650
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,705
That's it!

651
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:11,854
Jack.

652
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:13,724
Billy, put those towels
on the ground,

653
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,727
spray some frigging
air freshener in here.

654
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,095
Someone's in your office.

655
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:18,194
Who is it?

656
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,865
It's a she.

657
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,070
It doesn't look like
she's from around these parts.

658
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:30,808
Okay, spray some
air freshener on me.

659
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:33,978
Come on, a little more.

660
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,894
Can I help you?

661
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:52,697
Mr. Woodman.

662
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,666
You must be lost.

663
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,867
Beverly Hills is west of here.

664
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,637
Are any of these chairs
safe to sit in?

665
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,074
Where are my manners?

666
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:10,882
So, Mrs...

667
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:11,832
Hunter.

668
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,133
Mrs. Hunter.

669
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,686
But you can call me Lana.

670
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,789
Something tells me
you're not here for a unit.

671
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:20,074
So you're the landlord.

672
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:21,357
Something like that.

673
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:22,749
One day you're king
of the world,

674
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,029
and the next,
you're in the gutter.

675
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,802
Excuse me,
who'd you say you were?

676
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,236
Tragic...

677
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,740
To have tasted the good life
and now be in this position.

678
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,872
How in the hell would you know

679
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,742
anything about
what I've tasted?

680
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,846
Jack Woodman,
recruited by REG at 23.

681
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,714
No college, no family,
no connections.

682
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,384
Just a natural salesman.

683
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,853
Then you got greedy.

684
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,255
You had to be
a real estate developer.

685
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,289
Engrave your name in lights.

686
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:53,675
Pride comes before the fall.

687
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,127
Listen, you clearly think
you can just march in here

688
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,898
with your little Hugo outfit,
your Prada shoes,

689
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,434
your exposed cleavage
and just walk all over me.

690
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,403
I don't think so.

691
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,038
Now...

692
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,038
Who are you,

693
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,076
and what the hell
are you doing here?

694
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,718
We received your phone call.

695
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,254
And now I'm here with an offer.

696
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,789
Who's "we"?

697
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,891
My husband is Frank Hunter.

698
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,094
We have a Malibu villa
for sale.

699
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,130
It's got everything
your average billionaire

700
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,833
could ever ask for.

701
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,101
<i>Infinity pool, wine cellar,</i>

702
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,738
<i>helipad, spa, gym,</i>

703
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,106
<i>3D televisions,</i>

704
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,774
<i>even a pizza oven.</i>

705
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,875
<i>It's a $20 million home,</i>

706
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,211
and we're ready
to let it go for 12.

707
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,914
We need somebody who has
connections to big bucks,

708
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,916
can get the job done fast,

709
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,186
and keep his mouth shut.

710
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,156
When I made those phone calls,
I was looking for a job

711
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,059
where I could go
completely unnoticed.

712
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,428
We can work around
your situation.

713
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:08,199
You'll be generously rewarded.

714
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,366
Too high risk, lady.

715
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,500
You sell this place today

716
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,036
or you'll be left with nothing.

717
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,905
After you pay off your debts,

718
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,740
not to mention the banks.

719
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,876
You need this commission.

720
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,812
I need it like I need
a finger up my ass.

721
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,052
Is that an invitation?

722
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:34,960
They said you would never give
or take no for an answer.

723
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:39,130
Pity I couldn't have met
the man you used to be.

724
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,501
He was an asshole.

725
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,336
Then nothing's changed.

726
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:03,520
What was that about?

727
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:08,193
Nothing. Just helping her find her
way back to some high-end spa.

728
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,096
What was she doing hanging around
with the garbage over here?

729
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,998
There's garbage
over there, too, kid.

730
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,099
Yeah, but that garbage
can pay the bills.

731
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,903
Yeah,

732
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,402
Mrs. Kinda's toilet
needs another plunge.

733
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,773
Shit everywhere.

734
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,109
Billy.

735
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,011
What?

736
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,048
I need you to get my suit
dry-cleaned.

737
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,461
Yeah, it's Mr. Woodman here
for Mr. Hunter.

738
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,163
He's expecting you.

739
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,978
Sir, Mr. Woodman
is here.

740
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,980
Jason, you can go.

741
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,585
The infamous
Mr. Woodman?

742
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,353
Strong like bull.

743
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,689
Infamous Jack will do.

744
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:48,059
So, I assume that you know why
we're meeting here today.

745
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,894
Yeah, your wife filled me in.

746
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,528
And what do you think?

747
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:53,696
To be honest, I've been out of
the game for a little while.

748
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:56,000
No, about my wife.

749
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,970
What do you think
about my wife?

750
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,305
She's a stunning woman,
isn't she?

751
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,776
L.A. is full of them.

752
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,414
Well, I hear you've fallen
on hard times.

753
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:14,118
We all have a little
dirt on us.

754
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,988
What kind of stains you got?

755
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,359
Oil.

756
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,327
You know, you and I
are not that different.

757
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,031
When you were selling
real estate up on Mulholland,

758
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,567
<i>I was building pipeline
to the future.</i>

759
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,971
<i>12,000 miles of steel,
from the Black Sea to the Med.</i>

760
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,675
Turned water into wine,
dirt into gold.

761
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,543
That was then.

762
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:42,014
Now I'm just a man looking
to make one last deal.

763
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,483
Can you turn this into gold?

764
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,119
Like I told your wife,
they took my license away.

765
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,021
You're not going
to need a license.

766
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,499
George Cinque.

767
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,069
King and emperor.

768
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,471
It's now your new identity.

769
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,973
You're an international
realtor working privately

770
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,375
and exclusively for me.

771
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:13,411
Get in the market and sell
this property discreetly

772
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:16,949
to private individuals
who have the correct means,

773
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,317
cash.

774
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:22,186
You close this deal
in 30 days, I give you 10%.

775
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,488
That works out
to $1.2 million.

776
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,058
Cash deals are tough.

777
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,392
I'm going to need 15.

778
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,299
You live up to your reputation.

779
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,302
In order for this
to work, Mr. Hunter,

780
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,771
we're going to have to
approach this as a pocket listing.

781
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,271
Go on.

782
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,108
A pocket listing
is every realtor's dream.

783
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,543
It's the Houdini
of all real estate deals.

784
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:50,015
It's where only the buyer,
the seller and the agent

785
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,516
know the deal ever
even happened.

786
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,119
We'll hit big-time players,

787
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,054
sell, collect,

788
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,222
divide accordingly, walk away.

789
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,125
It's there, and then it's gone.

790
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,062
Pocket listing.

791
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,233
Get yourself
some proper clothes.

792
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,036
You're going to need
to look and act the part...

793
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,006
Mr. Cinque.

794
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,400
I knew you couldn't resist.

795
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,433
Too hot to turn down.

796
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:46,770
Are we still talking
about the house?

797
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,340
I'll show you out.

798
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:24,708
Who are you, and what have you
done with Wood?

799
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,144
This is what I used
to look like.

800
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,477
I looked up the word "lien".

801
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,915
And?

802
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,383
Looks like you're screwed.

803
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,783
Which is why I'm going
to be hanging out

804
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,186
in the hot spots for a while
till I close a deal

805
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,354
and get us out of this jam.

806
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:38,622
Who's gonna watch the place?

807
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,525
That's where you come in,
my friend.

808
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,209
I'm going to need someone
to run things

809
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,162
around here in my absence.

810
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,428
Think you're up for it?

811
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,994
Cut a few bucks
off of Granny's rent?

812
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,601
You drive a tough bargain.

813
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,202
I had a good teacher.

814
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,637
That you did.

815
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,539
Fair enough.

816
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,376
See you soon, kid.

817
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,669
You're not going to forget
about this place, are you?

818
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,647
Buddy, I've been trying
to forget about this place

819
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,217
since I first moved here.

820
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,153
But so far it hasn't worked.

821
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:15,292
Hey, Walter,
you want to get your dick wet,

822
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,593
-look at these two sluts.
-REG. How may I direct your call?

823
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,263
<i>-Janey.
-Jack?</i>

824
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,298
Pow. Pow.

825
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:22,631
Christmas bonus, bitches.

826
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:24,234
What are you doing
calling me here?

827
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,603
<i>Good news.</i>

828
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:28,139
Pack those bags. I got
a little surprise for you.

829
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,410
I am so sorry, Jack.

830
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,678
Let's not talk about all...

831
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,981
No, I am so stupid.

832
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,616
I tried telling Ron I found out Aaron
went into my computer

833
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,385
the night before the Chen deal...

834
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,718
But they advised me to drop it.

835
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,156
And then Ron got sick
and Aaron took over.

836
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:47,591
I was due for a promotion.

837
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,692
And?

838
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,528
Still getting coffee.

839
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:54,498
So Aaron is top dog now?

840
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:55,866
<i>He brought UTB
into company stock.</i>

841
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,670
<i>They're sweeping everything
from Venice to Valencia.</i>

842
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,538
He's a monster.

843
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,342
How would you like to sneak
under the snake's door?

844
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,375
Just wanted to remind you
of your 3:00 meeting.

845
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:08,278
Well, thanks for making
yourself useful.

846
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,884
What are you talking about?

847
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,451
I'm working on something new.

848
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,509
Janey, what's up?

849
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,356
Fingers crossed.

850
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,530
Nice swing.

851
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:36,900
I heard about your little
tete-a-tete with Lana.

852
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,071
Just small talk
at its smallest, Mr. Hunter.

853
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,876
With age comes wisdom.

854
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,377
You're very slick,

855
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,914
but you got a long road
ahead of you.

856
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,416
I sent my wife to lure you in,

857
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,385
because I knew that you,
like me,

858
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:57,388
would succumb to temptation.

859
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:00,659
We both lust
for the finer things.

860
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,628
But let's get
one thing straight.

861
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,430
You talk when
I tell you to talk.

862
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,480
Well, what do you think?

863
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,816
I got you the helipad.

864
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,452
Mr. Woodman,
you're a man of your word.

865
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:31,556
I'll have my people
get back to you.

866
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,692
Thank you very much.
Appreciate your time.

867
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,593
What do you think?

868
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,030
It's nice, but too small.

869
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,766
I think we can cut a deal here.

870
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,869
Let me show you
the wine cellar.

871
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,787
How was the first day?

872
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,390
We need to make
some changes around here.

873
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,760
Like what?

874
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,730
This needs to be a pristine,
celestial setting, Mr. Hunter.

875
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,099
I don't want any of your people
roaming around.

876
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:18,902
Especially that Jason weasel.

877
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:23,641
His presence attracts.

878
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:26,411
And if you want to use him
as your little spy,

879
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,079
then let's get
one thing straight.

880
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,649
I'm here for business.

881
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,918
Otherwise,
just sell it yourself.

882
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,923
I used to have
Doberman Pinschers.

883
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,928
But they couldn't stop
clawing each other.

884
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,532
So I put one of them down.

885
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,803
Do you know what I did
to the other one?

886
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:54,571
I had him neutered.

887
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,876
Keep working.

888
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,074
-I am not your toy, Frank!
-Shut up.

889
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:32,909
How dare you hit me.

890
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,813
You shut up
and do what I say.

891
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,016
You do as you're told, woman.

892
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:55,799
Don't worry.

893
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,068
This won't smudge your mascara.

894
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,839
I'm biding my time.

895
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,708
Aren't we all?

896
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:07,010
You're a very seductive man,

897
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:09,079
aren't you, Mr. Woodman?

898
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,114
Seduction is the art
of selling something

899
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,018
the other party isn't even
sure they want.

900
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:16,120
No.

901
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,722
Seduction is manipulation

902
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,557
disguised as romance.

903
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,062
You'd better get that.

904
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,568
<i>-Janey...
-Good news, Jack.</i>

905
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,704
<i>I've got a whale lined up
for tomorrow.</i>

906
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:34,736
Perfect.

907
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:36,037
New client?

908
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:40,744
A few scheduled second visits.

909
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,112
It's been a long day.

910
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,615
You should go home.

911
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,682
Thank you for all
your help today.

912
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,684
Believe it or not,
this isn't the first time

913
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,619
it's happened on a job.

914
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,189
They warn you about situations like
this in the real estate manual.

915
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:28,159
Your hotel room, tonight.

916
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,728
I'll show you what they don't
teach you in the manual.

917
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,105
<i>? I want you</i>

918
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:44,942
<i>? I need you</i>

919
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:49,913
<i>? I want you to notice me</i>

920
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,817
<i>? I love you?</i>

921
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:04,993
What the fuck, man?

922
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,155
Little suit guy,
you want some more?

923
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,260
No more. No money.

924
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,295
No money. No money.
No money.

925
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,197
No money.

926
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,668
We need to talk.

927
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,871
I am Victor, and this is Oleg.

928
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:51,107
Cinque.

929
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,177
Cinque. You French?

930
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,945
Why not.

931
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:58,282
We are interested in your
relationship with Mr. Hunter.

932
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,082
Mr. Hunter?

933
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:02,719
I'm his realtor.

934
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,889
What is "realtor"?

935
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:07,324
I'm selling his beach house.

936
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:10,894
So that's why you've been hanging
out there so much?

937
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,896
You guys are quick?

938
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,367
How long till it's sold?

939
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,704
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe never.

940
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:20,937
What's it to you?

941
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,940
Hunter is an old friend
of ours,

942
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:25,308
but he seems to have
forgotten about us.

943
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,044
Aw, heartbreaking.

944
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,046
In any case, Hunter owes us.

945
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,449
You got one day
to sell the house.

946
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,150
One day?
Listen, my friend,

947
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:37,888
over here, houses don't sell
in one day.

948
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,192
Fine. Seven days
sounds fair.

949
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:43,928
What do you think, Oleg?

950
00:52:46,028 --> 00:52:48,766
Don't tell Hunter nothing?

951
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,970
Sell fast, wise-ass.

952
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:14,057
My turn to play nurse.

953
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,099
I see you've met my husband's former
business acquaintances.

954
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,434
Who were those guys?

955
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,803
Old partners of Frank's.

956
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,139
From another lifetime.

957
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:32,375
And in that lifetime,

958
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,280
did he maybe
owe them something?

959
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,816
There's a reason
why Frank wanted you.

960
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,151
You don't exist.

961
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:41,752
How flattering.

962
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,054
He knew that nobody
could track the deal,

963
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,085
and he could make a clean getaway.

964
00:53:45,086 --> 00:53:46,056
From what?

965
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:48,025
Every cheap hoodlum
in Eastern Europe.

966
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:49,393
Frank stole from his clients,

967
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:52,228
from his Mafia partners
and everyone in between.

968
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,833
Now the people he screwed over are
looking to screw him.

969
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,300
The house is all we have left.

970
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:01,005
Man.

971
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:04,407
Of all the slum joints
in all the world,

972
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,176
you had to walk into mine.

973
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,014
I quit.
Find a new patsy.

974
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,180
-Really?
-Yeah.

975
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,348
And what are you going to do?

976
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,951
Go back to your stupid
little life

977
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:15,351
in that crusty hellhole?

978
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,428
Believe it or not,
the ghetto's starting to look

979
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,156
pretty fucking good right now.

980
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,491
You'll never get another shot
in this town again.

981
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,396
You can't even sell a house
under your real name.

982
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,378
Come on, Janey.
Where are you?

983
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,347
Come on.

984
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,849
Quit pacing.

985
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,918
It doesn't suit you.

986
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,287
I got some good news.

987
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,423
A potential prospect
is coming in today.

988
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,226
Who is it?

989
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,961
Sworn to secrecy.

990
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,932
I hope you're making
the right moves.

991
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:04,835
I know this game,
Mr. Hunter.

992
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,305
Well, one wrong move

993
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,671
could be deadly.

994
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,210
Could be him right now.

995
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,282
Welcome, welcome.

996
00:55:22,518 --> 00:55:24,955
Well, well.

997
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,226
Woodman lives.

998
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,864
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

999
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:39,302
Nice place,
Woodman.

1000
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,005
Or do you
go by Cinque now?

1001
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,442
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1002
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:47,243
Sure you do.

1003
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,114
So my clients say
some Euro trash

1004
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,615
is peddling a Malibu estate.

1005
00:55:52,648 --> 00:55:54,885
And so I think,

1006
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,655
who's leaking my Rolodex?

1007
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,323
So I do some sniffing around,

1008
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,259
<i>and I find a rat in my midst.</i>

1009
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:05,096
A sneaky little coffee girl.

1010
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,698
Where is she?

1011
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,567
She's, on a flight
back to Iowa,

1012
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,172
or whatever flyover
Bugtussle town she comes from.

1013
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:19,342
So I hear you're trying
to set up an all-cash deal.

1014
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,146
You still think
you got what it takes?

1015
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,415
You forget
who showed you the way.

1016
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:28,152
Now that I can't deny.

1017
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,322
And with the right suit
and the right property,

1018
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,157
you can close.

1019
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,059
So I'm going to let you.

1020
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,261
Trying to make amends?

1021
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:39,663
Jack,

1022
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:41,498
still holding on
to old grudges?

1023
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,067
How is it my fault
that you got sloppy?

1024
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,019
Sloppy?

1025
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,320
Yes.

1026
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,504
Hell, yes.

1027
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:51,407
You had dumb Jane handle
all the financial transfers.

1028
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,676
If you're going
to break the rules,

1029
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,045
you always do it alone.

1030
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,448
No witnesses.

1031
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,116
You taught me that.

1032
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:00,717
You're right.

1033
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,186
I was a hell of a guy.

1034
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,222
So since we're rekindling
this spark,

1035
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,459
how about I throw you a bone
after this deal is done.

1036
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:09,427
What deal?

1037
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:10,392
The deal you're going

1038
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,196
to close for me
with this house.

1039
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,367
Even though you're operating
under an alias,

1040
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,103
I still know who you are, Jack.

1041
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,538
All of your old friends
at REG also remember you.

1042
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,240
We have a laugh at
your expense every so often.

1043
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:30,079
By the way, how'd you like those
suits I sent by the other day?

1044
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:31,614
And only you, Jack,

1045
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:35,251
would leave a little hood rat,
crack baby in charge.

1046
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:37,454
Let's keep this
between us, shall we?

1047
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:40,124
Yes.

1048
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:43,460
Let's. You wrap the deal.

1049
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:46,697
I take the credit,
plus the lion's share.

1050
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,666
And once the money is split up
between me and the owner,

1051
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:54,271
I'll throw you a little piece for
old time's sake.

1052
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,507
Let me digest that.

1053
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,574
Well, it's either that
or I call the DA

1054
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:03,014
and I report your little Janey
for corporate espionage.

1055
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,115
Grand theft.

1056
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,253
You've outdone yourself, Aaron.

1057
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,655
These damn pocket listings,

1058
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:15,358
Just keep getting you
in trouble every time.

1059
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:21,130
I was sorry to hear
about your father.

1060
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,499
He was a good man.

1061
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,803
I doubt he's looking down
on you and smiling.

1062
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,770
Jack.

1063
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,074
My dad wanted to play hero.

1064
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,342
But me, I'm a realist.

1065
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,394
I know who you are.

1066
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:35,511
Yeah?

1067
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,515
Who's that?

1068
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:40,616
You're a nobody.

1069
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,286
Bottom-feeder.

1070
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,486
You came from nothing,

1071
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,289
and you will wind up
with nothing.

1072
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,291
All you can do
is make people believe

1073
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,493
you're someone you're not.

1074
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,197
So I'm going to let you
do that.

1075
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,731
And then I'm going
to send you back

1076
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,300
to that filthy slum rat hole

1077
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,204
where you belong.

1078
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,076
Just like old times.

1079
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,511
I'm thrilled to be
working together again.

1080
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,523
Is that
the new client?

1081
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,726
Yup.

1082
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,429
What'd he say?

1083
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,197
He said he'd think about it.

1084
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:30,867
I may not be a bullshit broker,

1085
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,103
but I know a few things
about business.

1086
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,406
Back where I make deals,

1087
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:39,876
when things go sour,
they get ugly in a hurry.

1088
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,678
I'm talking about fingernails
getting pulled out.

1089
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,248
Needles in your eyes.

1090
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,282
Your nut sack in a grinder.

1091
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,119
I don't want that.

1092
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:52,222
Do you?

1093
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,838
You should run.

1094
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,275
I got people depending on me to put
a roof over their heads.

1095
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:15,379
So, not so bad after all?

1096
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:18,381
Good, bad,
don't make a difference.

1097
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,351
I don't deliver,
we're both screwed.

1098
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,554
He has money.

1099
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:26,754
What?

1100
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:29,393
Frank. He has cash.

1101
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,795
Enough to solve both
our problems immediately.

1102
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:32,995
He keeps it locked in a safe

1103
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,698
and nobody knows
the combination

1104
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:37,800
except...

1105
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,810
<i>? I want you</i>

1106
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:50,880
<i>? I need you</i>

1107
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:55,719
<i>? I want you to notice me</i>

1108
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,591
<i>? I love you</i>

1109
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,593
<i>? I feel you</i>

1110
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:09,199
<i>? I want you to ravish me?</i>

1111
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,602
Have you ever been to Marbella?

1112
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,740
Barcelona, yes.
Marbella, no.

1113
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,976
I was there years ago.

1114
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,711
Crystal-clear blue ocean,

1115
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,447
untouched white beaches.

1116
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,451
I always said that I would
go back there one day,

1117
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,868
put my old life behind me.

1118
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:30,253
Really?

1119
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,989
Where do Frank
and his business partners

1120
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,590
fit into this whole mess?

1121
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,958
I gave up everything
to marry Frank.

1122
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,362
My life, my career.

1123
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,694
Turned your back on modeling?

1124
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,365
Petroleum engineering.

1125
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,534
I was Frank's partner.

1126
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,536
Before we knew it,
the crash happened

1127
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:50,873
and we lost hundreds of millions
in less than 24 hours.

1128
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,776
That must have been
a lousy day.

1129
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:58,948
So, you see,
we're not that different.

1130
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:03,721
We both know what it's like
to have everything

1131
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,789
and lose it all in an instant.

1132
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,527
This is our chance.

1133
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,297
Our chance at what?

1134
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,797
Grand larceny?

1135
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,300
Safe cracking?

1136
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,507
Getting our lives back.

1137
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,816
We could go fifty-fifty.

1138
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,387
Partners in crime.

1139
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,592
Maybe in love.

1140
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,831
How much does he have
in the vault?

1141
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,599
<i>More than enough.</i>

1142
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:52,735
<i>I'll slip some sleeping pills
in his drink</i>

1143
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,670
<i>before you come over.</i>

1144
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,004
Lana?

1145
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,849
We'll do it tomorrow.

1146
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,818
I thought we could have
dinner together tonight,

1147
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,118
talk about tomorrow.

1148
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,888
What's tomorrow?

1149
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:16,327
I mean beyond tomorrow,
when the house sells.

1150
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:20,463
Sure, whatever you'd like.

1151
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,612
Are you sure he's asleep?

1152
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,231
Jesus, Jesus!

1153
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:31,767
You think you're smart?

1154
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,440
Stupid!

1155
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:39,509
Now you're just another body

1156
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:42,045
that I have to bury in the vineyard.

1157
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:44,614
What do you think that'll do
for the price of the place?

1158
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:08,538
How much did you put
in his drink?

1159
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,007
Not enough, apparently.
Prick.

1160
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,909
You said you were just
going to knock him out.

1161
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,479
Did you poison him?

1162
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,547
Don't be so naive.

1163
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:20,549
We are so fucked!

1164
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,817
He was going to kill us both.

1165
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,252
All we have to do
is clean this up.

1166
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,053
Just say he went on a business trip
and never returned.

1167
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,624
Really?
And how do we do that?

1168
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:28,992
Do I throw him over a cliff?

1169
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,693
Bury him in the desert?

1170
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,764
He always wanted
to be cremated.

1171
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,187
Doesn't look like it's working.

1172
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:01,492
If it doesn't work, bury him.

1173
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:54,043
Wipe that look off your face.

1174
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,944
Did you really think
he was going to let you live?

1175
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,031
You were a dead man as soon as
that job was done.

1176
01:06:58,748 --> 01:06:59,948
How much does he have?

1177
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,318
Not as much as I'd hoped

1178
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,818
but enough to get us going.

1179
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:04,721
We can leave
tomorrow afternoon.

1180
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,655
This money won't solve
any problems.

1181
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,791
It won't even last you
six months.

1182
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:11,193
You run from the mob,
you're running forever.

1183
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:12,929
What do you suggest?

1184
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:15,030
From now on,
you stay at the motel.

1185
01:07:15,063 --> 01:07:16,865
Why?

1186
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:19,702
Because this house
is going off the market.

1187
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:28,043
It's a good buy.
Think about it.

1188
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,813
I'll slice a few bucks off
for you.

1189
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:30,563
My pleasure.

1190
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:31,312
All right.

1191
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,215
Thank you.

1192
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:34,984
Let me get that for you.

1193
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,332
You can't be here.

1194
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:53,235
You don't write,
you don't call.

1195
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,271
Well, the good news is,
we're nearing escrow, comrades.

1196
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,844
Tired of waiting for return
on investment.

1197
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:03,146
We're going to collect
half up front.

1198
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:04,979
Half what?

1199
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,416
That's between us
and the old man.

1200
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,952
What time he going to be home?

1201
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,688
Tough luck.
He just went out of town.

1202
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,020
Out of town?

1203
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,423
Yeah.

1204
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,693
Why, where, and when for?

1205
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,261
I'm his realtor,

1206
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,230
not his travel agent.

1207
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,873
First principle of finance,
real estate douche bag...

1208
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,174
Time value of money.

1209
01:08:32,175 --> 01:08:35,345
Now, when's Hunter coming back?

1210
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,112
Maybe two, three days.

1211
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:39,782
The second he is back,
you call us.

1212
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:42,685
We come over
for an unexpected visit,

1213
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,319
everyone goes home happy.

1214
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:48,024
Well, not everyone.

1215
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:49,356
Get the gist?

1216
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,030
Oleg, we're going to be late
for that surfing lesson.

1217
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,766
Let's go look
at some big boobs, man.

1218
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,407
Fuck. Who's that?

1219
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,180
Cinque.

1220
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,250
I'm going to call you
Mr. Stink instead of Mr. Cinque.

1221
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:15,282
More fitting.

1222
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,119
You find our buyer?

1223
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,922
Not exactly.

1224
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,960
You know, I actually thought
you could make a comeback.

1225
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,830
I guess I didn't
let you try?

1226
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,331
In any case, I got a sheik.

1227
01:09:28,363 --> 01:09:29,765
A sheik?

1228
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,942
Yeah, some big-money Arab
looking for a beach house.

1229
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:41,811
Going to bring him by tomorrow,
take over the deal.

1230
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,447
If I were you I'd...
I'd pack up

1231
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,081
and head back to South Central.

1232
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:48,885
You didn't let me
finish my sentence.

1233
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:51,820
I closed the deal yesterday.

1234
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,121
It's done.

1235
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:57,092
Big-time player,
very hush-hush.

1236
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,762
Is he a local?

1237
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,363
You'll know tomorrow.

1238
01:10:00,395 --> 01:10:01,898
Be at the house by noon,

1239
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,297
if you want a piece
of the action, that is.

1240
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:05,969
Wait, if I want
a piece of the action?

1241
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,370
This is my deal, fuck face.

1242
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:08,855
Then come and close it,
big boy.

1243
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,212
Becoming a man of God,
are we, Billy?

1244
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,115
I was sending
a message to Granny.

1245
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,490
When?

1246
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,193
Monday.

1247
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,899
Well, I'm sorry
I wasn't here for you, kid,

1248
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,398
but you should be awfully
proud of yourself.

1249
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,201
Your grandma lived a long
and healthy life,

1250
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:41,171
and you took
good care of her, buddy.

1251
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,139
Yeah.
At least she went

1252
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,974
before we got thrown out
into the streets.

1253
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:50,547
Look, Billy,
worst-case scenario,

1254
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,980
you wind up in public housing
for a couple of months, okay?

1255
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,283
I promise you
I'm giving it my...

1256
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,219
No, you're not!

1257
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,385
You don't care about
me or anyone else in this building.

1258
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,054
You're still the same
self-serving prick you were

1259
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,390
the day you bought this place.

1260
01:11:03,391 --> 01:11:05,227
All you're trying to do
is save your own ass.

1261
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,197
You little shit.

1262
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:09,496
You're lucky that was cold.

1263
01:11:09,497 --> 01:11:10,899
Of course it was cold.

1264
01:11:10,932 --> 01:11:12,334
It's been sitting there
for a month.

1265
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,169
And unlike you, I don't
intentionally hurt people.

1266
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,072
Don't you talk to me
about hurt.

1267
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:20,042
This building
destroyed my life.

1268
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,946
I curse the day I laid eyes

1269
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,282
on this godforsaken flea hole.

1270
01:11:30,418 --> 01:11:35,826
Sorry, Billy, but this place
is a sinking ship.

1271
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,932
I'm not going down with it.

1272
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,268
I thought our friendship
meant something.

1273
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,936
I guess I was wrong.

1274
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,271
You're no different
than my dad, or yours.

1275
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,204
It's set up.

1276
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:24,274
Whatever happens...

1277
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,911
I'm glad I came
looking for you.

1278
01:12:49,664 --> 01:12:52,668
Didn't I tell you not to play
Dirty Harry with this?

1279
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:59,509
Yo, G, gonna get this fool.

1280
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,426
You're early.

1281
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,758
I taught you well.

1282
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,228
Where's my buyer?

1283
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:22,365
Stuck in traffic.
PCH is a bitch.

1284
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:25,268
Make yourself at home.

1285
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,505
Introduce me as a property rep.

1286
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:32,174
This way it'll be clear
that you're an assistant,

1287
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,411
and that I gave you permission
to act on my behalf.

1288
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,213
Did you hear me...

1289
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,546
Jackoff?

1290
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:43,420
What the hell are you doing?

1291
01:13:43,421 --> 01:13:44,721
On hot days like today,

1292
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,989
it's always advisable

1293
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:49,192
to remove any
sweat-inducing clothes.

1294
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:52,195
This way when the client
does show up,

1295
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,430
you'll be cool as a cucumber.

1296
01:13:54,462 --> 01:13:55,397
Go on.

1297
01:13:55,398 --> 01:13:57,266
No, I don't think
you're in any position

1298
01:13:57,298 --> 01:14:00,369
to be giving instructions.

1299
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:02,338
Did you hear what I said
regarding the buyer?

1300
01:14:02,339 --> 01:14:03,371
I did.

1301
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,441
But we've just got
one last piece

1302
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:06,542
of unfinished business.

1303
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:07,843
What's that?

1304
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,148
Jesus, Jack.

1305
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,702
Just a few more trade secrets
I want to share with you, Aaron.

1306
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,123
God, you hit
like a little girl.

1307
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,524
Rule number one,

1308
01:14:22,557 --> 01:14:26,528
never get the kitchen floor
bloody before a showing.

1309
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:40,342
You're a dead man.

1310
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,579
Rule number two...

1311
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:47,516
Never, ever kill
your connection to the buyer

1312
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,252
with a kitchen knife.

1313
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,222
You're right.

1314
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,057
I'm going to use these.

1315
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:06,168
What's the matter, Woodman?
No more pointers?

1316
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,509
Rule number three...

1317
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:17,146
Sellers fight fair,
closers fight to win.

1318
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:22,150
God!

1319
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,220
Hey, hey. Relax, relax.

1320
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,523
Wait for Cinque's call.

1321
01:15:27,555 --> 01:15:29,524
God!

1322
01:15:29,557 --> 01:15:30,492
Woodman!

1323
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:32,562
I hope we studied
the floor plan.

1324
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:33,895
I'm in the master.

1325
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,636
Payback time.

1326
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:51,279
You bastard!

1327
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,849
I'm coming for you.

1328
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,320
Woodman, I'm gonna find you,
you piece of shit.

1329
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,323
I hope you're saying
your prayers,

1330
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:03,193
'cause I'm gonna fucking
tear you apart!

1331
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:06,760
Where are you, freak?

1332
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:07,895
Right here.

1333
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,196
Woodman!

1334
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:12,335
You son of a bitch!

1335
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,736
Woodman!

1336
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,570
Woodman, you cocksucker!

1337
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:18,141
You open this door right now!

1338
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,211
Well...

1339
01:16:23,244 --> 01:16:25,480
Aaron Glass, property rep.

1340
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,150
I'm sure Cinque has
told you about me.

1341
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,583
We work very closely together.

1342
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,686
You ready to wrap this deal up?

1343
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,155
You mean this deal?

1344
01:16:34,622 --> 01:16:37,225
Hey, guys, wait.
Who the...

1345
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,594
Who the fuck are you?

1346
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:39,996
Where's Hunter?

1347
01:16:39,997 --> 01:16:41,364
Where the fuck is Woodman?

1348
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,599
Cinque!
The fucking fraud!

1349
01:16:43,631 --> 01:16:44,931
Who the hell Woodman?

1350
01:16:50,271 --> 01:16:51,707
All right, let's do this.

1351
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:53,509
Son of a bitch.

1352
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,678
Woodman, I'm coming for you!

1353
01:16:57,645 --> 01:16:59,349
Woodman!

1354
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:05,487
Aren't you boys
on the wrong side of town?

1355
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,761
I know, I know.

1356
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,828
Smoking isn't recommended
on the job.

1357
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:17,934
But fuck them if you can't take
a moment to enjoy the show.

1358
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,670
Excuse me, gentlemen, you're
obviously in the music industry.

1359
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,907
You're looking for a new pad?

1360
01:17:38,555 --> 01:17:40,690
Leave me alone!
Get... Get off me!

1361
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:43,024
It's Woodman you want!

1362
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,699
Take my car!
I'm just a realtor!

1363
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:53,502
I've got drugs.
I've got drugs. Just get...

1364
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:54,834
Get him down to the floor.

1365
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:32,609
I hope you kept the phone.

1366
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:43,452
I presume this is the contact
you were mentioning earlier?

1367
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:47,889
Thought so.

1368
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,292
One moment, please.

1369
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,661
Woodman! Woodman!

1370
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:57,932
Yeah, this is the property rep

1371
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,869
for the Malibu beach estate

1372
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:03,639
which Mr. Aaron Glass
was talking to you about earlier.

1373
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:05,607
Yeah, unfortunately
Mr. Glass

1374
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,476
is on an indefinite
leave of absence.

1375
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,381
I'm taking over.

1376
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:14,817
Why, yes.
An hour sounds fine.

1377
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:18,721
No problem at all.
Looking forward to it.

1378
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,929
Final tip, want to destroy
a competitor,

1379
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,665
make sure he never
comes back to bury you.

1380
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,735
You're gonna pay
for this, Woodman. You hear?

1381
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,372
Woodman!

1382
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:41,711
In order to sell houses,

1383
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:45,081
you have to make your clients
feel immediately at home.

1384
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,715
It's what their senses
tell them.

1385
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,684
How it looks...
How it smells.

1386
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:52,587
If they can really see
themselves in this new life.

1387
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,091
You see,
I don't just sell houses.

1388
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,458
I deal dreams.

1389
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:14,577
Allow me.
Why, thank you.

1390
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:25,086
So what do we think?

1391
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:29,756
<i>Yalla it is.</i>

1392
01:20:29,757 --> 01:20:32,394
Hello, my name
is Mr. Hunter.

1393
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:33,661
-Hello, sir.
-Pleasure.

1394
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,666
This is my home.
My home is your home.

1395
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:40,001
Shall we take a look around?

1396
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,779
What's up, my man?
How you doing?

1397
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:54,384
Not too bad. I just thought
I'd stop by and say hello.

1398
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,519
I like that.

1399
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,085
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, man.

1400
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:00,588
Consider this your permanent
residence, my friends.

1401
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,024
Free of charge.

1402
01:21:02,056 --> 01:21:03,957
Well, it's home sweet home,
you know what I mean?

1403
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:04,960
Thanks, man.

1404
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:05,992
Hey, you know what, man?

1405
01:21:05,993 --> 01:21:07,828
Why don't you stick around?
You want a beer or something?

1406
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:11,466
No, I've got some other
business to tend to...

1407
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,135
But I do have
one final request.

1408
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:14,569
What's that?

1409
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,905
Watch Billy's back for me,
would you?

1410
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:18,608
Yeah, sure thing.

1411
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,878
Enjoy.

1412
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,556
Wood.

1413
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,659
Good to see you back here.

1414
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:39,094
It's Wood now,
not "self-serving prick"?

1415
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,730
Truce?

1416
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,100
So you leaving for good?

1417
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,471
Seems so.

1418
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:49,939
Who's going to run the place?

1419
01:21:52,006 --> 01:21:53,742
You are.

1420
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:00,249
That's the deed,

1421
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,585
and that's your name on it.

1422
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:04,753
Deed?

1423
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,255
I can't afford this place.

1424
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,158
I'm not selling it to you.

1425
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,559
I'm giving it to you.

1426
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:12,260
All paid for.
No lien, no nothing.

1427
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:13,863
It's all yours.

1428
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:16,731
Mrs. Kinda will help you
manage it till you're 18.

1429
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,502
By that time, the market
would have changed,

1430
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,270
and this little place
will be worth millions.

1431
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:23,706
So it's all mine?

1432
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:25,240
You're the boss now, kid.

1433
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,009
The one in charge.

1434
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,815
It's no good unless
you're around.

1435
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:36,585
We can run the joint together,
like business partners.

1436
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,055
I got my own plans now, kid.

1437
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:46,996
But if I ever need
a place to stay...

1438
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,002
You got the presidential suite.

1439
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,007
Be good?

1440
01:22:59,008 --> 01:22:59,806
I will.

1441
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:00,876
All right.

1442
01:23:00,877 --> 01:23:02,177
Thanks, man.

1443
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:12,320
Well, the Malibu house
is finally gone.

1444
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,289
<i>And luckily,
Moussy was on board</i>

1445
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,091
<i>to play the part
of Mr. Hunter.</i>

1446
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:19,994
<i>And the sheik was a man
of his word. All cash.</i>

1447
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,998
Now that the deal is closed,
I'm out.

1448
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,667
That's right.

1449
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,569
Marbella is only
a plane ride away.

1450
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:30,838
And who knows?
She might even be the one.

1451
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:32,975
Hey, baby.

1452
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:35,310
So I guess you're confused
about who I really am.

1453
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,913
<i>Nice guy, scumbag,</i>

1454
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,318
<i>killer, victim.</i>

1455
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,885
<i>All depends on
who you're asking.</i>

1456
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:46,889
But in real estate,
I'm the one thing that makes it

1457
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,289
through good times and bad.

1458
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,925
<i>A survivor.</i>

1459
01:23:49,957 --> 01:23:51,224
<i>That's right.</i>

1460
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,594
<i>A survivor of</i>

1461
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:54,862
<i>extraordinary circumstance.</i>

1462
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:57,099
Nah, just call me Jack.

1463
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:58,600
Jack fucking...

1464
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,199
So, what are you
thinking? You like?

1465
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,904
It's spectacular.
Absolutely spectacular.

1466
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:11,373
Can we see the master bedroom?

1467
01:25:11,405 --> 01:25:13,074
We're supposed to.

1468
01:25:16,877 --> 01:25:19,280
Well, where was I?

1469
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,413
Guess she wasn't the one.

1470
01:25:20,414 --> 01:25:22,317
<i>Properties and pretty women,</i>

1471
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,019
they can always flip.

1472
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:27,055
Thank God that house boy
didn't aim any higher.

1473
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:29,692
It was a big risk,
but you know what they say.

1474
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,694
The only way to win is to play,

1475
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:36,698
and the best way to play
is with OPM.

1476
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,031
"Other people's money".

1477
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,019
Are you coming?

1478
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:42,269
I'll be right there, dear.

1479
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,370
Preferably counterfeit,

1480
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:44,873
<i>like Tommy boy's funny money,</i>

1481
01:25:44,905 --> 01:25:48,042
<i>which I just knew I could put
to good use one of these days.</i>

1482
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:50,311
I doubt Lana and her new buddy
will go far, though.

1483
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:53,414
<i>Fake money,
false passport and a missing husband?</i>

1484
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:54,514
Hey, get off her!

1485
01:25:54,515 --> 01:25:56,184
You do the math.

1486
01:25:57,987 --> 01:25:59,522
Speaking of missing people,
an investigation

1487
01:25:59,523 --> 01:26:01,523
was launched into
Aaron's disappearance,

1488
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:02,857
<i>and revealed
that he'd been engaged</i>

1489
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:04,627
<i>in tax evasion, extortion</i>

1490
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,832
<i>and possession of virtually
every drug in the book.</i>

1491
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:10,331
Don't think he'll be selling any more
million-dollar listings.

1492
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:12,134
<i>Can't say he'll be missed,
though.</i>

1493
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:14,836
Well.

1494
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,139
<i>And don't think I forgot
about Janey.</i>

1495
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,242
<i>I always had a soft spot
for her.</i>

1496
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:23,778
My, God. Jack.

1497
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:28,282
Any questions?

1498
01:26:28,315 --> 01:26:29,851
I think I'll take it.

1499
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:31,987
Great, I'll prepare the forms.

1500
01:26:36,056 --> 01:26:39,461
What are your plans
in Marbella?

1501
01:26:39,493 --> 01:26:42,797
My business partner and I
are exploring new options.

1502
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,134
Looking good, Billy.

1503
01:26:47,002 --> 01:26:48,871
Thanks, Wood!

1504
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:52,505
Well, Mr. Woodman.

1505
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:56,110
Would you like to have
a drink with me

1506
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:59,315
to explore some
possibilities regarding payment?

1507
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:02,017
Maybe...

1508
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,320
Keeping some details

1509
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,856
just between us.

1510
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:11,993
Sounds like a good deal to me.

1511
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:12,233
Woodman.

1512
01:31:12,734 --> 01:31:14,403
Woodman...

1513
01:31:19,573 --> 01:31:21,509
You're going
to fucking pay, Woodman.

1514
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:25,113
You're going to pay.
Yeah. Woodman...
