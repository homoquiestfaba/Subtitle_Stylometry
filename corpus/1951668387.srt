00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>Command Performance USA,</i>

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>coming to you this week and every week
until it's over, over there.</i>

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>Flash! This is the news
the allied world has been waiting for.</i>

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,025
<i>{\a6}The battle for Berlin has ended,</i>

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,612
<i>{\a6}and Germany's unconditional surrender
is expected within days.</i>

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,365
<i>After 12 years and three months,</i>

7
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>Hitler's self-proclaimed 1,000-year Reich
has ceased to exist,</i>

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,830
<i>but what of those reports
of a secret Nazi superweapon</i>

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,918
<i>Categorically false,
says the War Department,</i>

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,503
<i>and we believe them,</i>

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,965
<i>so to every one of our brave Gls
soon to be home...</i>

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,008
Hey, Chuck, can that radio!

13
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,303
Like we need to be thinking about home
at a time like this.

14
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,013
Say sauerkraut.

15
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,391
Your best scowl yet, Kowalsky.

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:05,566
So they got a superweapon.
We got one, too.

17
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,402
You mean that poster boy
for the recruitment office?

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,113
He's gonna die down there
just like the rest of us.

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,867
Captain. Drop zone, sir.

20
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,248
All right, let's do this.

21
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,791
Let's go.

22
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,483
Go! Go! Go!

23
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,218
Where's your Super Soldier, Barnes?
We're getting blown to pieces!

24
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,349
Here he comes!

25
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,454
Okay, soldiers, let's take this dump!

26
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,597
So that's their superweapon.

27
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:26,707
Kleiser.

28
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,057
This war is over, and you have lost.

29
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,517
Haven't you heard?

30
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,394
Hitler's dead!

31
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:55,318
Patriotic fool! Look around you.
This isn't about Hitler!

32
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,732
Cap.

33
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,236
<i>My dearest Gail,</i>

34
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:26,618
<i>My only regret is
that I couldn't see you one last time,</i>

35
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,913
<i>but I know in my heart
that we will meet again</i>

36
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,582
<i>in this life or the next.</i>

37
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,085
<i>Love, Steve.</i>

38
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,934
Still nothing, General.

39
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,103
- Professor Ross?
- Hold on.

40
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,274
I'm realigning inertial navigation systems.
Here we go.

41
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,737
A new one?

42
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:35,956
Multiply that by 60-plus years

43
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,126
Glacial mass off the starboard bow!

44
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,378
All stop.

45
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,435
Where?

46
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,063
One hundred and eighty-two meters
straight ahead,

47
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,732
inside that glacier.

48
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,088
Well, l'll be damned.

49
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:30,987
l wanna minimize any undue trauma
to the cadaver.

50
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,573
Again, nice work, Professor.

51
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,576
l'll let you be the one to inform Dr. Banner.

52
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,119
Thank you, General.

53
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,096
Dr. Banner? Excuse me. Sir?

54
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,475
You were telling us the reason
we've been assigned to the Program.

55
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,896
Right, well, let's see. Yes, General Fury.

56
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,192
so he's beefing up my staff.

57
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,904
The Super Soldierserum, the same one

58
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:17,158
{\a6}that elevated a frail enlisted man
to the peak of human physical perfection.

59
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:23,039
It's useless,
thanks to the inept record keepers of 1040,

60
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:28,211
at the end of World War II.

61
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,922
Then what data
are we basing our trials on?

62
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,299
A 4,000-page hypothesis,

63
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,555
You'll note that we have
12 Super Soldier candidates

64
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,974
for whom we're developoing
12 different serums.

65
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,892
It's unique for every person,

66
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:48,773
only I am authorized
to handle their blood samples.

67
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,608
But, then, what will we be doing?

68
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:57,115
It's what administers the serum.

69
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,910
Any questions?

70
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,081
Any questions not about the Hulk?

71
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,752
We found him!

72
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,327
How's the body? Any damage?

73
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,661
None that I could see.

74
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,915
I mean, he looks like
he could just get up off the table.

75
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,425
They'd better be careful.
The tissue could be fragile.

76
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,619
Easy, soldier.

77
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,288
This is not what you think.

78
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,715
Everyone stand down.

79
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,759
Let him get outside.

80
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,296
A lot has changed, son.

81
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,049
Did... Did we win?

82
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,010
We did.

83
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,098
<i>Mission control,
activation of Shield One is complete.</i>

84
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,225
<i>Affirmative, Sat Team. Stand by.</i>

85
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,824
All systems are green, General.

86
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,954
Yes, sir.

87
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,760
Already?

88
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,059
It's confirmed. Vibranium hull.
Definitely a Chitauri ship.

89
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,727
It's changing course.

90
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,314
You can run, but you can't hide,
not anymore.

91
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,568
Sir, vectors indicate
it's moving into orbit toward the satellite.

92
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,782
Get those astronauts
back in the shuttle now!

93
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,591
Return to shuttle immediately.

94
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,677
I repeat, pull yourteam in.

95
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
That is a hostile craft.

96
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,847
<i>Affirmative.</i>

97
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,975
Patch the signal into the war room.

98
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,376
We have a situation.

99
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,590
<i>We cannot break free.</i>

100
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,466
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

101
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,816
<i>We're burning up! We're burning...</i>

102
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,781
<i>General Fury, how long
before you can deploy another satellite?</i>

103
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,909
I won't sacrifice any more lives

104
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,244
until we can guarantee
the success ofthis mission.

105
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,331
Within the week.

106
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,417
<i>Then we will use that time
to put a defense initiative in place.</i>

107
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,377
<i>Jumpstart Project Avenger.</i>

108
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,380
With all due respect,
that would be a mistake.

109
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:53,179
<i>Begin recruitment efforts immediately.
You have our short list.</i>

110
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:59,435
They won't take orders from me
oranyone else.

111
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:06,776
Now that we've found Captain America...

112
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,694
<i>That is all, General.</i>

113
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,458
They're just making sure he's stable.

114
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,418
Still, I should be in there.

115
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,214
- What?
- I don't know.

116
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:37,640
I know.

117
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:44,814
No, Betty, I mean our problems.

118
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:50,695
Look, I know things have been bad.
l've screwed things up,

119
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:56,826
Stop it! Just stop it! This isn't about us.

120
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:05,334
- Why?
- Why?

121
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,795
Because it's never different.

122
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,214
You'll never have it under control,

123
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,301
and I can't live like that, not anymore.

124
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:21,142
Banner, how soon before
there's a working trial on that serum?

125
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,353
- It's hard to say. Four weeks maybe.
- No good.

126
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,355
The entire program is circling the drain.

127
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,607
They can't do that!

128
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,525
l need results, fast.

129
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,860
Then take me off my meds.

130
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,778
- They're slowing me down.
- No!

131
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,448
We all remember the last time
you tried that, Banner.

132
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,658
They're still rebuilding the city.

133
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:47,209
We're still waiting for components
from Stark Enterprises,

134
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,753
and I can't get a hold of Tony.

135
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,298
Don't worry about it.
I know how to get his attention.

136
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,432
Sorry for the delay, Mr. Fortier.

137
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,729
Next week at the latest.

138
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,633
I'll have what he's having.

139
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,511
Are you really Russian, or are you
just trying to make an impression?

140
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,972
I try nothing.

141
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,820
Let's start again. I'm Tony.

142
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,572
Stark, I know.
I saw your name on the building.

143
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,158
- And you are?
- Unimpressed.

144
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,036
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

145
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,329
Would you like me to?

146
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,999
- Let's start with your name.
- Not here. In private.

147
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,130
Is this private enough?

148
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,299
Natalia

149
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,428
Romanoff.

150
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,305
As in the Black Widow?

151
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,016
I prefer to call her my number one.

152
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,645
You're a hard man to pin down, Tony.

153
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,314
Not really, given the proper motivation.

154
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,985
Where are my parts?

155
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,280
Try and be more specific.
l supply SHIELD with many parts.

156
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,115
You do, don't you?

157
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,701
Could be you're overextended.

158
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,995
Too many fat military contracts?

159
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,707
Nice, Fury.

160
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,876
Bully the man who put SHIELD on the map.

161
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,920
It was my impression
we put you on the map.

162
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,256
Your parts were shipped out this afternoon.

163
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,675
Now, we both know
you're not here busting my chops

164
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,512
- What do you really want?
- This guy.

165
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,558
- Iron Man? Why come to me?
- I think you know him.

166
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,060
In fact,
I think he came to you for his armor.

167
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,687
Please, I'm insulted.

168
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,231
Stark Industries doesn't make cheap toys.

169
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,738
- Jarvis, who am I having dinner with?
- The Governor, sir, in 15 minutes.

170
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,785
I'm free for nightcaps later. Interested?
You can bring your gun.

171
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,537
Maybe later.

172
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,206
So long, Fury.

173
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,087
This isn't a game, Stark.

174
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,633
l want your help on this.

175
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,259
All right, if it's that important,

176
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,095
l'll supply you
with my latest line of armaments,

177
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,935
Jarvis, send Fury home
with a couple of my new plasma cannons.

178
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,311
Certainly, sir.

179
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:57,441
shall we, Mr. Stark?

180
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,068
No promises.

181
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:28,597
The Program still exists? But l...
I was told that it ended with me.

182
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,350
It did, but not for lack of trying.

183
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,644
It was reinstated several years ago.

184
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,563
What, bad idea?

185
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,356
I don't know.

186
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:44,530
I haven't been able
to duplicate the process, but I will.

187
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,699
We're kind of hoping
you'll help us with that,

188
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,035
which is why l'd like to take a blood sample
if that's okay.

189
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,418
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

190
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,381
It means that much to you?

191
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,466
It's everything to me.

192
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,639
Here, this was in your jacket.
I wanted to make sure you got it back.

193
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,976
Is she still alive?

194
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,062
Yes, but there's something
you should know.

195
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:32,286
It's a diffrent city than he remembers.

196
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,831
- Man, I hate ants.
- I know.

197
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,835
Still holding a grudge, I see.

198
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,380
No, I look at it this way.
You got what you deserved.

199
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:48,260
Good to see you've matured, Hank.

200
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,764
- Is she expecting you?
- Yes, I am.

201
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,856
Don't forget your ants.

202
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,945
I'll never understand
what you see in that guy.

203
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,698
Yeah, unfortunately,
he doesn't see it, either,

204
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:21,919
Good to know I can still inspire people.

205
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,254
So what brings you to Brooklyn?

206
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,383
We're forming a team, Janet.
I believe you'd be an asset.

207
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:32,221
We've got a problem
that's more than SHIELD can handle.

208
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,890
Sorry, but I can't tell you
any more than that.

209
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,685
I don't know, Nick.
This sounds too big for me,

210
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:49,697
Before you make up your mind,
I want to show you something.

211
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,782
Yes?

212
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,831
Listen, Jan, you don't need to beg Fury
to invite me to his little party.

213
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,416
l can sell myself.

214
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,546
Just show me what you got, Hank.

215
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,687
Never underestimate
pretentious lab jockeys, Fury.

216
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:31,030
- Tragic, but why tell me?
- Iron Man is attempting to rescue it.

217
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,952
Welcome to the team.

218
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:21,663
<i>Please. Please, I'm only part
of a larger rescue effort.</i>

219
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,665
<i>{\a6}- Be sure to...
- Target is stationary, sir,</i>

220
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,336
<i>{\a6}Hold all positions.</i>

221
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,675
<i>Sorry, folks. That's all for today.
I'm late for a tune-up.</i>

222
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,844
<i>He's made us.</i>

223
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,304
Let's move!

224
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,563
<i>Ease up, Iron Man.
I just wanna have a conversation.</i>

225
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,691
Okay, here's your choice.

226
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,778
<i>Either set down,
or we're gonna set you down.</i>

227
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,197
<i>- Right.
- Hi, there.</i>

228
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,416
<i>What do you want with me?</i>

229
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,627
A minute of your time. That's all.

230
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,920
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

231
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:15,968
I want you on that team.

232
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,220
<i>I work alone.</i>

233
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,098
<i>And by the way,</i>

234
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,810
<i>Stark sold you some lousy guns.</i>

235
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,731
<i>Nice outfit.</i>

236
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,491
Really, guys, I can find my way from here.

237
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,326
Go get a cup of joe or something.

238
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,162
I think I'm gonna dye it black
and then get it pierced.

239
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,248
What do you think?

240
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,750
The neighborhood's changed a little.

241
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,864
- I hear they call you Buck now.
- Cap!

242
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,952
I couldn't believe it when I got the call.
It's just...

243
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,456
Oh, hey, what am I doing?
Come in. Come in.

244
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,417
- How about some decaf?
- Sure.

245
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,462
What's a decaf?

246
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,642
I'm sorry, Steve,
but for the rest of us, time moved on.

247
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,519
- Has she had a good life?
- She has.

248
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,730
We were so devastated,

249
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,858
and then, over the years, Gail and ljust...

250
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,655
- Well, you know.
- It's okay. Listen, is she here?

251
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,868
She needs more time.

252
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,536
I hope you understand.

253
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,168
What do you hear from the guys?

254
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:39,111
Everything I knew, everyone I cared for,
they're all gone.

255
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:44,992
You haven't lost everything, son.

256
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:49,079
You still have your country,
and we need you now more than ever.

257
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,103
Why me, General?

258
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,397
Because you're the only one
who has faced this enemy

259
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,732
and defeated them.

260
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,944
Well, I do. Here, get to know your team.

261
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,405
What's his story?

262
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,742
He flies, hurls lightning, makes rain.
That sort of thing.

263
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:31,663
Some, but this guy thinks he can do it
because he's Thor.

264
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:37,919
I think he's a few rounds short of a full clip,

265
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,756
but there's no getting over
those powers of his.

266
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,134
I have faced down the frost giants
of Jotumheim,

267
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:52,976
so your threats matter nothing to me,
whale killer.

268
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,853
<i>I won't be warning you again.</i>

269
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,690
<i>Either turn around and let us pass,
or things will get serious.</i>

270
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,610
We don't want your kind around here.

271
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,945
Oh, but things are serious,

272
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,656
and though we are
but peaceful demonstrators,

273
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,576
do not assume we cannot be provoked.

274
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,996
Like that.

275
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,995
Return to port.

276
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,091
Please, wait for me below.

277
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,098
Nicholas Fury, never a pleasure.

278
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,183
Hello, Goldilocks.

279
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:19,896
I don't believe we've met.

280
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,065
We have not, officially.

281
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,568
Thirsty?

282
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,364
Asgardian mead, nectar of the gods.

283
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,576
- Guaranteed to make you feel immortal.
- No, thanks.

284
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,704
I hope you are not here to arrest us

285
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,081
for our recent protests
in Washington, General.

286
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:43,420
Until you were provoked. Yes, I know.

287
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:49,634
We're forming a team
to fend off a global threat,

288
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,219
so what do you say?

289
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,388
This.

290
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,557
And this.

291
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,937
Go back to your paymasters, General,

292
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:07,986
- Thor...
- Not interested.

293
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,366
But at the very least,
your team will have a conscience.

294
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,744
Safe passage, my friend.

295
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,871
You, too.

296
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,421
Sir, what happened down there?
Were we attacked?

297
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,217
Yeah, by Bruce Banner.

298
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,677
There's a monster inside the good doctor.

299
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,014
That's what happens
when a guy shares space

300
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,601
with an explosion of gamma radiation
and survives.

301
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:44,648
Every time he finds himself
even a little upset,

302
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:53,490
He becomes raw, unleashed rage,

303
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,952
a hulking monster
right out of your worst nightmares.

304
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,813
That's Captain America?
He looks so young.

305
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,357
Yeah, well,
he's about 60 years too old for you,

306
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,693
so you can pick your tongue up
off the floor now.

307
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,243
So, Fury, who have you got in mind
to lead this little scout troop?

308
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,288
Kind of early for a promotion, isn't it, Pym?

309
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,166
All right, everyone listen up.

310
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,548
You'll be working as a unit
under the command of Captain America.

311
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,217
Great. We'll all end up on ice.

312
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,885
So let's get started.

313
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,060
Pym, that's enough.

314
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,062
Okay, now that we're all here.

315
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:15,196
a nuclear warhead.

316
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,241
Fortunately, it was scuttled
before it could reach Washington,

317
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:32,589
Oh, come on. Little green men?

318
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,425
Mr. Pym, I have seen these things.

319
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,845
They've killed my men,
so they are very real.

320
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,726
And just before they went into hiding,
the unit photographer took these.

321
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,354
The Germans called them Chitauri.

322
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:55,779
and like to buzz our nuclear power plants
and military facilities.

323
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,947
We finally figured out how to track them,

324
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:03,828
This is what they thought of that idea.

325
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,039
<i>We're burning up! We're burning...</i>

326
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,751
Oh, my God.

327
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:17,926
One of their ships was destroyed
when the Nazi warhead detonated.

328
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,011
That was our first lucky break.

329
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:28,937
We got this hull panel and some fragments.

330
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,233
- What kind of alloy is this?
- Unknown.

331
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:38,446
but whatever it is,
it absorbs energy like a sponge.

332
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,843
Well, nothing except more vibranium.

333
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,806
Unfortunately, the amount we've recovered
is minimal.

334
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:14,023
Tony will just backburner us
for the next 12 months.

335
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,277
I don't know how you guys put up
with that arrogant jerk.

336
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:25,535
- Am I correct?
- I never said this was gonna be easy,

337
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,371
so if any of you want out, tell me now.

338
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,548
l had to learn everything about you.

339
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,176
You'll be happy to know

340
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,596
that the analysis of your blood
has yielded exciting results.

341
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,100
Dr. Banner, I know about the Hulk.

342
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:17,438
You have to understand,
the Hulk has ruined everything in my life.

343
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:21,526
My work, my identify, my relationships.

344
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,444
And you think the serum can help you?

345
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,490
Yes! That monster is a menace
because he can't be controlled,

346
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,285
but the very principles
of the Super Soldier process

347
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,496
indicate that such transmutations
can be controlled.

348
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,208
He can be a benefit to humanify,
just like you are.

349
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:42,338
- Why?
- All I ever wanted was to serve my counry

350
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:51,890
We all have our place in this fight,
Dr. Banner.

351
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,643
You are a man ofscience.
Use that to leave your mark on the world.

352
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,688
We're finished here, Captain.
Thank you for coming.

353
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,400
Yes?

354
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,277
On my way, General.

355
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,957
Oh, no! Oh, no!

356
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,342
Leave me alone!

357
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,264
You've been ignoring your meds!

358
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,267
Betty, I can't focus.

359
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,853
You know the Hulk will destroy everything.

360
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,772
I didn't ask for any of this.

361
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,150
Neither did I.
You're not the only victim here.

362
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:56,913
a high-securify SHIELD facility
was breached by a Chitauri alien.

363
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,166
He then proceeded to kill
every security officer on site.

364
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,546
<i>My guess is,
he's after the Shield One satellites,</i>

365
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,424
<i>the same kind
they pushed out of orbit yesterday.</i>

366
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:13,137
<i>the automated defense system
surrounding the center hub.</i>

367
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,306
<i>We've been unable to disable it.</i>

368
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,768
Captain, we cannot afford
to lose those satellites,

369
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:23,272
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,108
Here's your new issue.

371
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,611
The shield is a blend ofadamantium
and vibranium fragments.

372
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,738
No one will be denting this one.

373
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,240
Well done.

374
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,994
Tell me, are you issuing trashcan lids
to the whole team or just him?

375
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,078
Shut up, Hank.

376
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,914
You waste vibranium on his shield
when we need it for weapons?

377
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,584
In the hands of Captain America,
that shield is a weapon.

378
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,112
Glad you could join us.

379
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,615
<i>Don't put me on the payroll just yet.
Let's see how this goes.</i>

380
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,758
General Fury!
The intruder has hacked into ourdatabase.

381
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,721
Lock him out.

382
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,348
I'm trying, but nothing's working.

383
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,701
<i>Our orders are to secure the center hub
of the plant,</i>

384
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,078
<i>which is one level below ground.</i>

385
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,831
To get there, we have to first make it
past the automated weaponry.

386
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,210
- l can get through without setting them off.
- Wasp, not yet. Wasp!

387
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,462
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

388
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,214
Take it easy, old man.

389
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,008
Now you're gonna see
what today's heroes can do.

390
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,887
Iron Man, scan through the roof
to determine the alien's position.

391
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,933
I'll take the east entrance.

392
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:26,562
Great plan, coach.

393
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:30,024
- Bench your most powerful player.
- Those are your orders, Pym.

394
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,818
Let's go!

395
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,290
The central corridor is clear.
I'm proceeding ahead.

396
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,512
Loading bay is clear.

397
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,809
<i>The intruder is still in the center hub,
one floor down.</i>

398
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,563
<i>I'm detecting what could be
infrared triggers all around Wasp.</i>

399
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,822
Okay, everyone advance!

400
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,449
Wasp, that corridor is too hot.

401
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:25,246
Don't worry. At this size, nothing...

402
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,791
Jan! Janet!

403
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,798
<i>- Wasp, are you all right?
- I'll find her.</i>

404
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,217
No, Iron Man, stay in position.

405
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,140
<i>Sorry, Captain.
Rescuing ladies is what I do.</i>

406
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,262
Jan! Janet!

407
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,389
Pym, back off!

408
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,016
You're gonna bring the whole place down.

409
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,853
These amateurs!
They're going to get us killed.

410
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,983
Thanks. I... I'm not used to being rescued.

411
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,038
Move! Move! Move!

412
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,511
Help! He's not getting any air,
and I can't get his helmet off.

413
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,827
Listen, about
that "arrogant jerk" comment earlier...

414
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,788
Stark! I should have known.

415
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,459
- Sir, I'm afraid...
- Save it, Captain. I know what happened.

416
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:21,130
and steal everything there is to know
about SHIELD.

417
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:32,975
and if Hank hadn't left his post,
that intruder would have been ours.

418
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,852
I was trying to save my wife.

419
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:42,985
Oh, yeah? Well, good luck winning this
without us, Fury.

420
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,614
- I'm sorry.
- Janet!

421
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,659
This is exactly why I work alone.

422
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,622
You two, report back to base.

423
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,335
Captain, where are you going? Captain!

424
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,880
Let him go. I will talk to him.

425
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,391
Put the base on alert.
We're going to Defcon 4.

426
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,809
Yes, sir.

427
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,813
And patch me through to the SSP lab.

428
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:27,488
Promising news, General.
l think we're finally ready.

429
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,032
Good.
l want you to prepare for all 12 candidates.

430
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,368
Twelve? Well, isn't that rushing it a bit?

431
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,578
Banner, are you ready, or aren't you?

432
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,789
I am. I'll get right on it.

433
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,606
Where are you running to?

434
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,276
You have nowhere to go, Captain.

435
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,863
Steve, wait.

436
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,198
Please.

437
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:17,872
Your performance today,
it is to be admired, regardless of...

438
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,041
- I failed.
- No, the team failed you.

439
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,128
You were not responsible.

440
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,423
I told the General I wasn't ready for this.
Someone could have been killed.

441
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:32,428
It is not your burden.

442
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:41,687
and whether I get hurt or whether I die,
you are a man I'm willing to follow.

443
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,648
Do yourself a favor. Don't.

444
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,614
I just think that once General Fury
cools off, we should go talk to him.

445
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,659
- Forget it, Jan. Have you no dignity?
- It was our fault, Hank, ours.

446
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:59,246
- If we'd just listened to Steve...
- Why are you sticking up for that guy?

447
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,418
It's always everyone else's fault
and never yours, right, Hank?

448
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,753
Yeah, right.

449
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:33,989
He's supposed
to be getting the serum ready.

450
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,951
It's finished? He didn't say anything to me.

451
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,839
We have a problem.

452
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:56,345
What's he doing
processing his own blood?

453
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,888
Where are the other trials?

454
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,203
- There are no other trials.
- What?

455
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,331
All this time,
he's only been working on himself.

456
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,089
Wait! I can explain.

457
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:37,052
Not if you have the Hulk.

458
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,178
You're crazy.

459
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,557
No, with the serum, I can control him.

460
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,852
What?

461
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,313
Move to Defcon 5.

462
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:54,403
If we survive this attack,
you're gonna hang for this.

463
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,368
Oh, no.

464
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,585
Bruce!

465
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,962
What are you doing?

466
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,591
I'll fix this, Betty. I promise.

467
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,765
Stop, please!

468
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,059
Get out of there, Bruce!

469
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,103
It worked.

470
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,147
Betty, see? I told you.

471
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,942
Bruce, is that really you?

472
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,696
Yes, everything's gonna be okay.

473
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,503
Damn!

474
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,395
They're shutting us down.

475
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,887
Vibranium-tipped.

476
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,493
I need to go, Betty. Get to safety.

477
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:27,009
The Hulk's out there, but Bruce has control.

478
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,678
Oh, this just keeps getting better.

479
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,429
This is my fight! Stay out of it!

480
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,220
Oh, hell.

481
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,106
Good to see you, Stark.

482
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,442
<i>You're lucky.
l had an opening in my schedule.</i>

483
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:48,400
<i>Vibranium armor, Hank.
Let's see what we can do with that.</i>

484
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,863
Serve him up.

485
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,618
Yeah!

486
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:47,751
Who's the chick with the hammer?

487
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,420
<i>Whoevershe is, I'm glad she's on ourside.</i>

488
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,356
Dr. Banner! Bruce, you did it.

489
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,839
Rock giants crumble under the blow
of the mighty Mjolnir.

490
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,677
I fear this brute won't be as obliging.

491
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,280
Betty, how can we stop him?

492
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:45,619
What about Bruce's medicine?
Will it work on the Hulk?

493
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,704
Maybe, at 20 times the dose.

494
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,497
Go get as much as you can.

495
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,459
Leave him alone, Hulk. Fight me.

496
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:03,697
Now, knock it off, or I'm gonna squish you.

497
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,668
No!

498
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,136
No, Hulk!

499
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,590
Hulk, over here!

500
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,405
Hey, we're not finished yet.

501
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,455
Here!

502
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,750
Iron Man, Hank, slow him down.

503
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,087
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

504
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,720
Tag, you're it.

505
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,521
I can't get a bead on him.

506
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,483
- Wasp, distract him.
- I'm on it.

507
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,861
Stop!

508
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:54,325
Hulk! Hulk, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm here now.

509
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,746
I won't let them hurt you.

510
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:06,629
She's trying to calm him down
so he won't burn through the sedative.

511
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,758
I need you to stop fighting, okay?

512
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,386
It's time to rest.

513
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,098
Everything's going to be all right,
I promise.

514
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,808
Betty...

515
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,285
How long has he been like that?

516
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:41,122
Want me to let him know you're here?

517
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:44,000
No, I wouldn't know what to say.

518
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,923
Hey, Cap.

519
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,427
I brought someone by to see you.

520
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,940
He needed this.

521
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:08,983
So did she.

522
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:14,906
Now it's your turn.

523
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,552
To Captain America,

524
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:40,765
the man who fought to the finish
defending this bunch of ingrates.

525
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,331
General.

526
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,001
I still can't believe it.

527
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,128
It's finally over.

528
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,922
Those hotshots actually pulled it together.

529
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:16,384
Yes, they did. They had a great leader.
