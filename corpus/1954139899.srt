1
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,024
Love is everywhere :-)

2
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:21,463
Love in the City

3
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:24,225
Please note

4
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:25,704
On the right you will see Brooklin

5
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:27,744
The place where there are many representatives of

6
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,264
Russian-speaking population of New York

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,263
So half a million people

8
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:34,944
Excuse me,

9
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:35,944
You may remember the name of our guide?

10
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,465

11
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,985

12
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:41,545
He has to defend this year in New York

13
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:44,505
Married,

14
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,465
But the childless

15
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,585
Why do you want to know all this?

16
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:48,385
Because I also really like the architecture

17
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,545
And how, enjoyed a trip?

18
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,866
Very concise

19
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:58,346
You are a great guide

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,025
This concise little

21
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,546
Are there any tours?

22
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:03,346
There are only celestial path

23
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,225
I love the wild adventures

24
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:21,465
Thank you, goodbye

00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,667
After an evening umawialiœmy

29
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:33,306
Mr Igor ..

30
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,546
I have a sharp pain

31
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:35,547
And even spasms

32
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:36,748
I think I have a hypersensitive nerve

33
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,667
Well, please come

34
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,507

00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,067
Without anesthesia?

37
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,426
Welcome to Finland

38
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,428
In the harsh north country

39
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,068
Where people live tough

40
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,987
But good

41
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,827
I rejoice

42
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,348
Everyone got a ride

43
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,348
Robust deer

00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,548
We drink vodka!

48
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,349
Sparky is!

49
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,949

50
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:33,029
Okay already xit

51
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,988
After five minutes I take

52
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,709
Swallow, and three-minute home

53
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,150
Hey, do not know what kind of a

54
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,349
The one in black?

55
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:41,109
Saum, when are you wiser?

56
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,869
A little above

57
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,869
Together we practice corpus?

58
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,948
Hi!

59
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,469
"How I love you .."

60
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,310
"How can I make you fear .."

61
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,909
"When I saw you"

62
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,150
"This ungrateful time"

63
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,353
Good evening my dears

64
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,832
Welcome in my club

65
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:00,832
Applause!

66
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,591
You are in Brighton Beaches

00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:07,153
You can smoke here!

68
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,072
Happy Birthday!

69
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:13,112
Happy birthday to you ..

70
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,231
August has

71
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:24,032
What took you so long

72
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,112
Drinking something

73
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,192
Guys, I am not just a time as you

74
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,032

Ride

76
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,833
Guys

78
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:36,953

00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,154

"Over 100"

82
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,954
In addition,

83
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,635
100 and 101 were held at the same time

84
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,673
Just for a toast!

85
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:50,953
Artyom

86
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,993
Friend

87
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,832
Long ago

88
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,954
A little

89
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,593
But very po¿¹dna

90
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,834
Moscow school

91
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,594
She opened her arms in front of us

92
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,914
It took many years

93
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:04,514
It has long lived in New York

94
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,434
A favorite in our house

95
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,154
old women school

96
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,113
It has long been trading

97
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,674
Fordami Focus

98
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,195
But I'm happy

99
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,034
That our friendship

100
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,234
Survived all these minor disasters

101
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:21,673
I am extremely pleased

102
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,913
That fate let you

103
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,714
Learning in New York

104
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,593
Thanks Igorku

105
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,914
Saum, brother

106
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,354
I know you only a year

107
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,994
But through the years

108
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:33,796
I understood that

109
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,236
Maybe you're a Finn

110
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:36,556
But for the most Rus

111
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,035
Among all I know Rus

112
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:41,236
The horror comes to me

113
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,754
That will soon end your internship

114
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:45,715
And the guys

115
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:46,836
Wyprujecie home

116
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,915
And I officially announce

117
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,955
That stuffed in all their holes arsenic

118
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,435
But do not die by poison

119
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,756
And out of boredom!

120
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,915
Igorek do not worry

121
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:00,195
Have a drink for you in Moscow on the whole

122
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,756
And I in St. Petersburg

123
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:03,876
When I drop into bed with a stick fucking

124
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:06,796
I'd like to screaming your name

125
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:10,115
The sweetest moment

126
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,275
Guys, I hate you

127
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:14,157
We love you too

128
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,917
Hey baby, what's up?

129
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,796
Of course I remember

130
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,197
Today we have nine to go, well, there

131
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,556
Quietly

132
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:31,077
Well, of course I remember that the theater

133
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,237
I'm not sick

134
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,037
What performance?

135
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,637
Crazy

136
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,277
No. .. the Seagull

137
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,037
Well, yes

138
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,637
Sorry, misiu

139
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:45,797
've Forgotten, I'm a little twisted

140
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,957
We had to, well, drive to the city Chinoli

141
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:51,037
And then back

142
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:51,997
The traffic we

143
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,398
Quiet!

144
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:56,277
Something rustles?

145
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,957
Stand near the fountain

146
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,358
Baby, no excuse

147
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,398
Call your girlfriends

148
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:10,878
I also want you

149
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,158
But I do not know today

150
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,479
Good

151
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
So long

152
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,478
With what a fool r¿ycie

153
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,359
Artiomie, you do not know what awaits you

154
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,439
Debile, the plans for the evening?

155
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,118
Personally, I want to have sex

156
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
From geisha

157
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,519
Allow me to disagree

158
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,519
You can cultivate sport

159
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,359
Gamble

160
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,079
But I certainly do not love

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
And this is why

162
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,879
Because you can give up sport

163
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,159
The work may be discarded

164
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
And from love

165
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,321
I never get rid

166
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
And you then who?

167
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Mother Teresa?

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do not you guys

169
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Everything is simple

170
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,121
How can something always call

171
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,121
At your service

172
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Ch³opaczki

173
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,441
Dear friends

174
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,802
Tonight is like any other

175
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,921
Unfortunately, coming to an end

176
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,721
This is just an old zgred

177
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I have a toast

178
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
So a toast

179
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,522
I raise this cup

180
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:42,962
Glass...

181
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:44,082
With a charming sense of

182
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,561
... Lovely experience

183
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,841
Which arises between two people

184
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:49,082
That erupts between two people

185
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:51,282
Which connects the heart

186
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:52,402
Which combines the body

187
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,122
And that makes hearts beat rhythmically

188
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,682
And that makes your body moving rhythmically

189
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,441
For love

190
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,202
For SEX

191
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,203
And you young people

192
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:02,802
I would like to wish

193
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,403
To this is what wypiliœcie

194
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:06,482
It was not possible without this

195
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,401
For what I drank

196
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,922
The wonderful toast!

197
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,803
I think so too

198
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:16,283
For the girls!

199
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,322
Hurrah

200
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,284
Do not get me, a little, what is it?

201
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:49,123
Finnish dialect incomprehensible...

202
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,844
Do not be angry

203
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,363
I did not want

204
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,563
Maybe it is a little

205
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,004
Overtired

206
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,924
Yeah, everything ok Saum

207
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,444
As the saying goes

208
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:17,484
Big problem

209
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,124
Just not very clear

210
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:21,005
Why the hell I came to your fitness

211
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,405
I pay for two tiles

212
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,246
And so all ok

213
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,005

Good luck

216
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,606
No screaming / yelling at me!

217
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,166
Ladies and gentlemen

218
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,806
Please note

219
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:03,886
At the oldest skyscraper in New York

220
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,525
It was built

221
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,366
In the circumstances, very spicy

222
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,527
Listen to you!

223
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,686
In our old buildings full of Saratov

224
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:13,927
Here you have some better Attraction?

225
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,926
It would be better to go to massage

226
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,406
Are you there Napatrzy attractions

227
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:21,486
Babes Look SALE!

228
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,447
Hey, please stop the bus

229
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,328
We want there, there!

230
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,367
Okay, consent!

231
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,126
Shopping! Half an hour!

232
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,206
Carefully

233
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:38,846
True Knight

234
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,047
Thank you

235
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:42,848
Queen!

236
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,048
Well, what's old

237
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:59,329
No part of Igor

238
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,168
Want to play in the women's network without the ball?

239
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,248
It sounds intricate

240
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,168
Although I play better chess

241
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,927
Listen, Igorek, I know you from a small

242
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,688
volleyball players are born

243
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,809
OK, but what else championship?

244
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,929
Of course - your boat to the grid

245
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,169
Got it, anywhere, anytime after 20:00

246
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,249
Good

247
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,489
Igorek Listen, you have a globe in his office?

248
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,848
I want to show the girls

249
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,248
America where he will lay for 90 years

250
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,049
What a difference

251
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,369
Globus is not, is an atlas of the world

252
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,090
In the bottom drawer where the sheets

253
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,450
Geography is very useful

254
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,611
I found!

255
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,490
Ludek got to karaoke

256
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,570
Now, even her ears do not divert

257
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,609
I have no friends and enemies

258
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,330
Who would have thought

259
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,450
Advanced Saratov

260
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,769
No one is waiting for me

261
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,770
Only the echo of bitter words

262
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,250
Well there

263
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,490
What, in general you do not like me?

264
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,730
Mad by the end of this America or what

265
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,531
No no I like you

266
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,370
The first time I have something like this

267
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,330
Even such a touching song

268
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:32,131
The most important that the

269
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:38,413
I thought: such a nice guy

270
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,772
Self cottage

271
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,972
And the pants problem

272
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,332
Do not worry Igorek

273
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,051
You are so comfortable

274
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,332
Girls,

275
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,412
My dear

276
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,293
Just do not give a

277
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:51,852
What are you want podzia³aæ?

278
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:53,412
Finally, the bird left wings

279
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:23,454
Look at these good-natured animals

280
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,613
Electro-

281
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:42,694
Celibacy. Beginners Course

282
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,974
My dear, olives in the refrigerator, the microwave Cabbage

283
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,053
Exam early tomorrow, so I do not wake

284
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:55,373
While there, wake up!

285
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,095
I missed terribly!

286
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,336
Hi

287
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,216
Hey

288
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,095
I will not ask what you do

289
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,415
I am not sure if I want to know

290
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,736
Long story

291
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,416
It is normal that a week I fall asleep without you?

292
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:41,656
Of course not

293
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,095
But you can not change

294
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,135
I also think so

295
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,215
Sexologist

296
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,016
Who will last?

297
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,736
Saum? You there!

298
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:24,537
August has

299
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,098
Dude, what are you doing here?

300
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,816
Here?

301
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,656
Well here

302
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:33,736
And here

303
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:36,738
I'm going to the aerobics club

304
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:38,137
In front of me going to roll a black

305
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,577
has and-pod

306
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:41,258
And wham!

307
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:42,257
On the asphalt! As Chaplin on a banana peel

308
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,016
He did not even blink

309
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,977
And we all came together

310
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,019
Clays, Fire, Ambulance

311
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:48,898
You know what they say?

312
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:49,898
What?

313
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:50,578
Infarct

314
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,499
Time, and there is no black

315
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,779
That's awful

316
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,698
And what are you doing here

317
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:04,299
Here?

318
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,739
In the clinic?

319
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,059
Well

320
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,379
Watched all these horrors

321
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,418
I was afraid

322
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:12,259
Well, I decided to go to the doctor

323
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,898
I stand by it like that .. no .. Mammography

324
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,699
How we need to have

325
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,499
You also to mammologa

I walk down the street, I look out the window

329
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,659
You saw in the window sterczysz

330
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:40,979
I think - I go to talk a friend

331
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
No clear

332
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
No windows

333
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:59,941
You can see a problem with windows to

334
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,781
Not enough of their

335
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,060
Exactly, there are no windows

336
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,580
Who is the last one to mammologa

337
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,621
This young

338
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:18,941
Say, will you?

What is not it, what IS

00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:27,502
Not without a problem with that

343
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:30,301
With what?

344
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,781
Well, with dumbbell

345
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
With what dumbbells?

346
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,582
SO dumbbell

347
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,422
Saum, brains you sit on this shit

348
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:42,222
There are no weights targa

349
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,102
It is not that!

350
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,182
Facing you?

351
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,462

I am also not stand!

353
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:49,742
Ni fuck

354
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,782
What are you looking at

355
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:54,703
Stand to stand fast

356
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:57,262
We do not stand and sit

357
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,222
-No,

358
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,542
-Good - Come

359
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:02,782
Guys may be a case

360
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,382
Saum which case there

361
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:05,623
Once - a case

362
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:06,863
Two - the convergence of

363
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:07,702
A three - rule

364
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:09,142
And four?

365
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:10,062
Four were sent to us

366
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,384
That must be some kind of virus

367
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:14,142
Igor, you're a doctor after all

368
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:15,624
Invent something

369
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:16,383
Saum, I am not a doctor

370
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:17,064
A dentist

371
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,223
That's the first, second

372
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,103
It's not just the virus outbreak

373
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,183
The epidemic can only be the flu or the mumps

374
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,703
What with us

375
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:23,823
He wears a completely different this time .. ..

376
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:24,823
Do not say that out loud

377
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,384
Guys maybe we reflected in exile?

378
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:29,903
Maybe everything in the home state

379
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,022
In its place

380
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,503
This may effect the big city

381
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,344
Polluted air

382
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,424
Full of iron in water

383
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:37,744
Poultry packed with female hormones

384
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,143
Just

385
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:42,503
Recently I started to wonder

386
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,784
Why this makes me want to cry

387
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,543
MacChicken blame for everything!

388
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:00,343
How is it?

389
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,465
We sit closer?

390
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,385
Guys, maybe we're gay?

391
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,345
Come on guys there

392
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,906

00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:39,233
I feel, how to say

411
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,434
Not exactly efficient

412
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:42,793
How does it manifest itself?

413
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:44,234
Do you understand

414
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,314
If you refer to the animal world

415
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:47,873
My cheetah hunts not

416
00:24:47,474 --> 00:24:49,474

00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,075
Shrek lost his donkey

420
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:56,555
Winnie the Pooh does not want to climb into a hollow tree

421
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,395
Honey it does not involve more

So many years together

423
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:01,756
As the saying goes - at your side

424
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,915
It seems you know the fellow

425
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:05,955

I do not see any irregularities

434
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,436
Everything in your revolves around sex

435
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:32,156
Please try to talk to a woman

00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:34,516
But no hurry

437
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:35,835
Please explore the interior

438
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,235
Hear it

439
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:40,156

440
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:42,316

Goodbye

447
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,717
You see, in some sense we have something in common

448
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:58,276
I am also a doctor

449
00:25:57,717 --> 00:25:59,717
Dentist

450
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:00,717
They are afraid of us from birth

451
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,997
When I grow up begin to tremble before us

452
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,956
Goodbye

00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:07,077

Previously, it is not possible?

459
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:17,037
If you hurt my tooth

00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,076

00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,797
Goodbye

462
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:27,676
The fact that we have all the same thing at the same time

463
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,078
You can not call it a mere coincidence

464
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:31,918
Just me in paragraph wyj¹³eœ

465
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:33,558
Wait, when did it begin?

00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:35,078

00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,078
At my 2nd to 12:35

00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:42,478
Second 11:45

470
00:26:41,318 --> 00:26:43,318
And what were you doing when?

471
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:44,438
Deplored

472
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,718
Wait, what was before?

473
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:47,678
We sat in Bia³ugie

474
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:48,918
Some weird motha fucka there rose a toast

475
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,919
Stop

476
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,559
What did he say?

477
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,359
Wait a moment

478
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,958
Something like

479
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:56,558
To make this

480
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,838
To this is what you are drinking

481
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,839
It was not possible without this

482
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,479
For what he drank

483
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,399
Exactly!

484
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,199
We drank for sex!

485
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:05,278
And he?

486
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:07,278
Where is he? The clown?

487
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:08,678
Wait, I have his business card

488
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,959
Valentine Biedrosovich. Weddings Receptions Love. Beluga Restaurant

489
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,959
Why in America do not smoke anywhere else?

490
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,238
Well, why?

491
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Mr Valentine

492
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Somehow so much przychorowaliœmy

493
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,479
After you toast

494
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Yeah .. when we lose orientation

495
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
You may deign to explain what is happening?

496
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,641
You may cast a curse or something

497
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,159
Maybe cursed

498
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,799
And may the blessing of lowered

499
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Depends on how you look at it

500
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Something you ekstrasens whether the shaman having fun?

501
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Shaman, ekstrasens ..

502
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Nothing is

503
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,721
Well I know that nobody wants me

504
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:06,241
That none of my authority

505
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:08,522
There you have other idols

506
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,802
But...

507
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:13,561
Anyway, I'm

508
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:16,322
Holy Valentine

509
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:27,881
Only holiness in me

510
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,762
Ni cholera has left

511
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,642
I was assassinated in Rome in the third century

512
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,041
Then reborn into Tambov

513
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,042
I was a favorite of Tsarina

514
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:40,002
I quickly turned to another Winks

515
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,041
Probably read about it

516
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,722
Later, I realized quickly

517
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:47,602
That Valentine should develop an interest in the U.S.

518
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,562
Emigrated, promoted, rozkrêci³em interest

519
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:56,082
Then I saw

520
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:57,723
That behind these cards, hearts

521
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,003
There is no heart

522
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:05,123
Already 100 years dreaming

523
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,002
Die at home

524
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,083
You, merciful

525
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:16,523
After all, he screwed us

526
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:18,244
Look at the alcoholic

527
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:19,564
Phase grab

528
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:22,003
Come with us here

529
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:23,923
Do you hear, ekstrasensie

530
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,203
You have to do as it was before

531
00:29:25,484 --> 00:29:27,484
Or keeps you down!

532
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:29,603
There will not help you there!

533
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,525

534
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,725
Gotta hurt

535
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,725
A tray of us were

536
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:57,365
Harmless impotenci

00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,046

539
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:05,285
In total, yes, bunnies

540
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:06,925
Do not approach the grandmother of any

541
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:09,485
While you do not earn

542
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,166
Be worth a woman

543
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:14,164
Is to love her

544
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,605
Big sorry from me

545
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,125
Why all this?

546
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:21,206
I like it

547
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:23,006

00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,444
I do not know why

550
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,766
Probably because you are fellow citizens

551
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:30,564
What we do now?

552
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,166
It's simple

553
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:34,887
Seek Love

554
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:11,127
Jumped me something today

555
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,367
Nothing like that, buddy wants

556
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:14,606
Watch the sunset at the beach

557
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:16,887
Cathy, I promise it's the last day

558
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:19,448
Do not be angry

00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,128
I'll be late, as usual

560
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,967
This is a good for now

561
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:23,928
For the time being

562
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,650
Because it was cloudy at the beach

563
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,451
Hi there Kate, leave a message

564
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:15,572

00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,852
Good evening, Mrs. Raiso

Why in my house looking for his wife?

00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:26,772
Some crazy are you?

572
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:27,691

00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,412
You see my head on the blond hair?

575
00:33:30,412 --> 00:33:32,412
Not

576
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:33,131
What do you think I'm a blonde?

577
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,211

With his voyages

581
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:44,331

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,079
She did not want me to go to a restaurant

779
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
It was lovely

780
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Restaurants are trivial

781
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,360
A woman should gain, astound

782
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,120
I beg you, I also gain

783
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:26,199
How are your conquest?

784
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
I'm generally a big problem

785
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:30,481
I love my wife

786
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,360
He went the easy way

787
00:47:32,361 --> 00:47:34,361
It is not that

788
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,721
The point is that as we lived together

789
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,041
Wypaliliœmy the

790
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,921
All spowszednia³o

791
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:42,281
Her beauty, i. no.

792
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
And now I understand

793
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,402
That I can not live without her

794
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:46,802
There is no me

795
00:47:47,521 --> 00:47:49,521
I love her

796
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:51,201
Even more than before

797
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,720
Yeah

798
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,721
I went to the bookstore

799
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,961
Podjaraæ it?

800
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:00,481
Not

801
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:01,721
Looking for your I-pod

802
00:48:01,202 --> 00:48:03,202
Who?

803
00:48:03,722 --> 00:48:05,722
Well, its opposite

804
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:08,282
Any successes?

805
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,321
For the time being nondescript

806
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:11,881
This one gave me to hear Tchaikovsky

807
00:48:13,443 --> 00:48:15,443
The brain I nearly fell off

808
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,403
It is a sign at 100%

809
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:22,762
Guys I'm afraid

810
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:24,963
If you re-wrap

811
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,803
I can commit suicide

812
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:30,403
Saum do not give up

813
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:32,163
Invite her somewhere

814
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,522
Of course, talk to her

815
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:36,003
Why is a woman

816
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:37,243
Maybe will give you the inside

817
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:39,683
I do not know, can discover its horizons

818
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,043
Say hello dawn, immerse yourself in the grass

819
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:45,803
I'm about to finish her in the woods

820
00:48:47,242 --> 00:48:49,242
U³owi³em main idea

821
00:49:15,724 --> 00:49:17,724
What are you listening to Tchaikovsky in the morning

822
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:19,884
Fall in love?

823
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:20,805
Frankly, not yet

824
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,085
But today I do

825
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:23,243
Deer, I am stubborn

826
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:25,205
He was someone on purpose?

827
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,685
It is a little

828
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:27,445
Sex?

829
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:28,485
Nooo

830
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:30,004
I want to immerse myself in the beginning of its interior

831
00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:33,323
Jog after her own grass

832
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:34,764
Wet in the river

833
00:49:35,045 --> 00:49:37,045
Understand itself

834
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,685
I do not know Saum

835
00:49:37,964 --> 00:49:39,964
No one in my moczy³ River

836
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:42,004
People are different

837
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,125
Maybe she'll like it

838
00:49:42,685 --> 00:49:44,685
We'll see

839
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:45,725
I invited her to the theater tomorrow

840
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,485
When you grow up a child?

841
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,204
Listen

842
00:49:51,966 --> 00:49:53,966
You sleep in a kimono?

843
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,764
Just this, Saum

844
00:49:55,205 --> 00:49:57,205
You'll never know

845
00:50:37,046 --> 00:50:39,046
Eye on me? "

846
00:50:38,486 --> 00:50:40,486
Me? Not

847
00:50:39,846 --> 00:50:41,846
I'm here every day

848
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:42,806
Strange, I come here 2 years

849
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:45,767
And even once you have not seen

850
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:46,967
Previously simply

851
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,608
He practiced a different kind of sport

852
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,087
Yes?

853
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:51,687
I quit

854
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:52,327
Why do you cast?

855
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:54,368
Professional Trauma

856
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:56,049
I understand that no part of it!

857
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:10,088
Everything okay?

858
00:51:09,408 --> 00:51:11,408
Yes

859
00:51:10,288 --> 00:51:12,288
Damn slippery

860
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,688
Large space

861
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:14,447
Can help?

862
00:51:13,248 --> 00:51:15,248
You do not need

863
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:26,048
It can glide?

864
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:27,528
Sure

865
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:30,807
Not too well slides

866
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:46,929
It seems to me that if you drove to get

867
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:50,209
Would be less falls

868
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,970
You are a great joker

869
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:55,689
Admittedly, I never saw

870
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,050
Such acrobatics on ice

871
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:58,369
I'm glad

872
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,170
What do you plan on Friday?

873
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,249
I propose to double tulup and dinner

874
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,889
Not

875
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,050
No, I have completed Friday schedule

876
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:11,409
Sure

877
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:13,531
But please promise that you will think

878
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,890
I promise to think

879
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,170
To think over this

880
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,130
Well, I'll go work out wheels

881
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:24,411
Good luck

882
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,970
Thank you

883
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:54,611
Anastazjo Igoriewno

884
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:56,412
I want to say that you deserved it

885
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:11,172
All of this for me?

886
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:25,373
"Restaurant Fredbriks. At 20:00 I eat supper with chamomile"

887
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:30,012
"I can not delude ourselves that you will come. Igor"

888
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:39,732
Tempted innocent and happy girl

889
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,453
Now that you have to promise to marry me

890
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:48,133
We are pleased

891
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,613
Unfortunately, I'm married

892
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,854
In fact you can deliver a

893
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,333
I divorce you

894
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,533
Artyom, unless Raia returns

895
00:54:01,895 --> 00:54:03,895
Get up!

896
00:54:04,214 --> 00:54:06,214
Dress in a jiffy

897
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,414
Where? The wardrobe!

898
00:54:16,974 --> 00:54:18,974
Why wait until the cabinet

899
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:20,776
Own husband in the closet?

900
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:21,736
What kind of kindergarten, Cathy!

901
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:23,454
For cabinet Artyom!

902
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:27,174
Hi!

903
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:28,254
Hey Raisa!

904
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:32,335
What are you doing?

905
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:34,215
Reading

906
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,655
Well, what an interesting book?

907
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:43,055
Not bad, go eat something

908
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:46,135
Eat eat

909
00:54:56,055 --> 00:54:58,055
What people?

910
00:54:58,056 --> 00:55:00,056
Good morning, Ms. Raiso

911
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,096
How are you?

912
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:03,136
Why do I owe a visit in my closet?

913
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:05,376
Kaska right now does not want to move the wall

914
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:07,976
How I would naprosi³

915
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:09,536
Cathy, the sun

916
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,097
What do you see what this monster?

917
00:55:11,736 --> 00:55:13,736
Skinny as a stick

918
00:55:13,736 --> 00:55:15,736
Come on you feed the

919
00:55:15,136 --> 00:55:17,136
Come watch because I can not

920
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:21,576
Tail spectacle

921
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:22,857
I love Beckett

922
00:55:23,976 --> 00:55:25,976
There was a huge, gorgeous

923
00:55:26,815 --> 00:55:28,815
Similar to the statues of my favorite Jack Meyers

924
00:55:29,017 --> 00:55:31,017
What I really like - his novels

925
00:55:30,537 --> 00:55:32,537
"The dream of a beautiful woman and such a"

926
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,497
Have you read?

927
00:55:36,258 --> 00:55:38,258
Somehow I do not remember

928
00:55:38,138 --> 00:55:40,138
But the name of the super-

929
00:55:39,978 --> 00:55:41,978
I immediately think of is what

930
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:45,217
You know, you may find yourself to me for tea?

931
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:48,657
Together we think

932
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,578
Only a cup of tea?

933
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:51,977
Not

934
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:53,498
Even the d¿emik

935
00:55:54,337 --> 00:55:56,337
In this sense,

936
00:55:56,617 --> 00:55:58,617
What d¿emik?

937
00:55:58,339 --> 00:56:00,339
With blueberries

938
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:01,778
I like Jagoda

939
00:56:02,658 --> 00:56:04,658
Lick fingers when eating

940
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:07,777
Come on you with his grandmother, we explore

941
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,298
Let's go!

942
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:30,739
We have a good, hi

943
00:56:32,499 --> 00:56:34,499
Thank you that you've come

944
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:36,178
I'm only here because of chamomile

945
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:38,619
That meant

946
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:43,059
Please forgive me

947
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,580
Our Mom went to China

948
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:46,379
I did not leave with someone Vera

949
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:48,099
Means, who was with but she did not want

950
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,380
Nothing like that, I think that with every teenager

951
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,059
Even unbearable - we manage

952
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,620
What's so milczycie?

953
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:57,099
About Me talking about?

954
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,700
Waiter, I want to order something

955
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,580
Please bring me

956
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:16,261
Where such sophistication in the French?

957
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:18,181
I read Voltaire

958
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:19,062
What I wish other

959
00:57:18,261 --> 00:57:20,261
Mr Igor

960
00:57:19,861 --> 00:57:21,861
How often do you plan to visit us?

961
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,021
How often?

962
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,060
To the extent permitted by the Anastasia Igorievna

963
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,340
And the sense of decency

964
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:30,021
You know that Nastia has been cavalier

965
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:32,021
Very famous Canadian surgeon

966
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,621
Vera

967
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:35,381
What am I wrong?

968
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:36,821
Such a bore at Nastia boring

969
00:57:38,782 --> 00:57:40,782
Anyway, anyway you have an apartment?

970
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,620
What are you doing, stop it!

971
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,381
Relax, I have my own place

972
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,502
In the beautiful

973
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:46,981
Splendidly

974
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:48,222
I mean in the long term

975
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:49,782
Nastia moved out to you

976
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:51,342
And I'll take the room!

977
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:12,422
Hey, you called

978
00:58:14,263 --> 00:58:16,263
And so I do not drink with someone

979
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:18,463
And this is what?

980
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:19,183
She does not drink

981
00:58:18,143 --> 00:58:20,143
He works in the library

982
00:58:19,422 --> 00:58:21,422
It's me or not drink

983
00:58:28,064 --> 00:58:30,064
You told me that opposites attract right?

984
00:58:33,823 --> 00:58:35,823
This is why the mine and its opposite

985
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:39,983
Do not attract?

986
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:41,063
You should make

987
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,783
Where's your willpower?

988
00:58:43,342 --> 00:58:45,342
It would seem that such a good, wise

989
00:58:45,584 --> 00:58:47,584
He lives with his grandmother

990
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:48,703
You have to like my grandma

991
00:58:48,184 --> 00:58:50,184
No, Grandma does not give advice

992
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:52,064
Why?

993
00:58:51,424 --> 00:58:53,424
Come on! After all, Grandma

994
00:58:54,383 --> 00:58:56,383
It would be a massacre

995
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,784
I agree

996
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:01,305
Someone landed to my girlfriend?

997
00:59:01,744 --> 00:59:03,744
The fact someone sticks to our jumps

998
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:05,944
Sit down!

999
00:59:08,624 --> 00:59:10,624
Hey, you there!

1000
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:12,424
What do you want bitch?

1001
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:35,944
But time flies right?

1002
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:39,265
30-particle neck

1003
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:42,466
Do not remind

1004
00:59:42,585 --> 00:59:44,585
They say that the 30-particle is the end

1005
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:47,146
You can put the crosshairs

1006
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:50,186
Flabby flesh and bags under the eyes

1007
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:53,226
Problems with urine, briefs on the latch

1008
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:55,425
Wrinkles

1009
00:59:54,585 --> 00:59:56,585
Cottage cheese, cucumbers szkalrniowe

1010
00:59:56,587 --> 00:59:58,587
Cholesterol also

1011
01:00:00,345 --> 01:00:02,345
With loud music

1012
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:03,946
R & B just for teenagers

1013
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:08,146
I also believe, I listened only to classical events

1014
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,065
Indeed we age

1015
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:18,067
But it was good for the youth

1016
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:21,346
On the screen appeared InterRussia

1017
01:00:22,066 --> 01:00:24,066
Sour candy

1018
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,708
Aunt Asia came

1019
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:29,828
Guys, where are they now?

1020
01:00:31,148 --> 01:00:33,148
But I wanted to buy glany!

1021
01:00:38,107 --> 01:00:40,107
I love you

1022
01:00:41,828 --> 01:00:43,828
I strongly and sincerely

1023
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:47,068
Over the life

1024
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:48,949
And I love you

1025
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,547
Grow old together

1026
01:00:55,548 --> 01:00:57,548
We'll see

1027
01:00:57,788 --> 01:00:59,788
You know, you can grow old

1028
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:01,309
With someone you trust

1029
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:03,228
And how can you trust?

1030
01:01:03,187 --> 01:01:05,187
What do you teach your own children?

1031
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:07,868
Wait

1032
01:01:07,388 --> 01:01:09,388
I will try not to drive

1033
01:01:11,507 --> 01:01:13,507
For you I am ready to become a man

1034
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:15,829
Impossible!

1035
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:18,829
Although I would prefer not

1036
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,828
You will be you man

1037
01:02:44,112 --> 01:02:46,112
Hi

1038
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:50,191
Do not stop myself, I'm coming

1039
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:23,193
How do I learn to fly the equipment?

1040
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,633
I did not want a child to be a dentist

1041
01:03:25,953 --> 01:03:27,953
Yes?

1042
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:28,913
Even as a child I knew who I

1043
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:31,113
My father, therefore, stopped to buy me a doll

1044
01:03:32,032 --> 01:03:34,032
Because all of them picked

1045
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:35,314
Sadza³am on the couch

1046
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:37,233
I did make a passionate night interviews

1047
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:40,513
Then he reassured them and fed cotton candy

1048
01:03:41,473 --> 01:03:43,473
Since childhood, I like cotton candy

1049
01:03:43,434 --> 01:03:45,434
What else do you like?

1050
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,955
And so you have betrayed too much

1051
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:50,233
Now your turn

1052
01:03:49,754 --> 01:03:51,754
Hurry will say I do not like

1053
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,195
So I do not like

1054
01:03:53,715 --> 01:03:55,715
Stewed onions, ironed shirts

1055
01:03:56,715 --> 01:03:58,715
I hate obwlekaæ Sheets

1056
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,754
Przyczym always wondered how women are successful

1057
01:04:03,074 --> 01:04:05,074
How? We are in the genes

1058
01:04:06,715 --> 01:04:08,715
The experience of generations

1059
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:13,234
See more!

1060
01:04:31,155 --> 01:04:33,155
Why we bought so many products

1061
01:04:32,716 --> 01:04:34,716
Because there is nothing worse than a starving woman

1062
01:04:35,995 --> 01:04:37,995
Decided to feed me?

1063
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:39,635
Yes! I'll bake the lamb

1064
01:04:39,195 --> 01:04:41,195
You will become a nice and gentle

1065
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,676

01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,357
Nastia, this is Margo

1072
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:07,837
My patient

1073
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:09,517
Former

1074
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,835

I have come to doleczyæ .. the lower three

Apparently you did not dowierciliœmy

1082
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,837

01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:34,037
Igorek, no to Mrs. dowieræ

A propos

01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:52,117
If the next time you break gimlet

1088
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:55,198
Turn to another point of repair

1089
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:02,437
I gave you the key right?

1090
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:17,041
In the grip of liberation

1091
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:18,521
Torsion should be carried out thumb nawprost

1092
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,840
One, two

1093
01:07:20,122 --> 01:07:22,122
Again

1094
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:24,641
Remember?

1095
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,081
You have one second?

Which will protect against attack psycho

1098
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:36,401
I gotta tell you something very important

1099
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:39,281
Thought about everything

1100
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:40,441
Psychol attacks from the rear

1101
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,721
I am not a striker

1102
01:07:43,242 --> 01:07:45,242
Psycho psycho

1103
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,762
Listen to me in the end?

1104
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,522
Everything I know. Do not go into the interview! We must be vigilant!

1105

Understand

1108
01:08:05,322 --> 01:08:07,322
You meet someone every day

1109
01:08:07,442 --> 01:08:09,442
And do not see it quite

1110
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,004
What a fool out of me

1111
01:08:12,962 --> 01:08:14,962
No mother

1112
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:18,483
You start to notice that before you stands an angel

1113
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,163
How could you not see?

1114
01:08:22,563 --> 01:08:24,563
How could I not notice?

1115
01:08:24,362 --> 01:08:26,362
Do you understand?

1116
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:28,563
You are gentle, warm

1117
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:34,444
Sexy

1118
01:08:33,924 --> 01:08:35,924
You're my symphony, you know?

1119
01:08:37,163 --> 01:08:39,163
Come with me to St. Petersburg

1120
01:08:38,684 --> 01:08:40,684
In December

1121
01:08:39,924 --> 01:08:41,924
I can not live without you another day

1122
01:08:44,644 --> 01:08:46,644
You know, without you I can not live

1123
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:49,724
As no air

1124
01:08:55,405 --> 01:08:57,405
It may lie!

1125
01:08:57,243 --> 01:08:59,243
Spin and lie!

1126
01:08:59,284 --> 01:09:01,284
Do not believe him!

1127
01:09:01,165 --> 01:09:03,165
You can!

1128
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:54,806
Can I help you?

1129
01:09:55,646 --> 01:09:57,646
This is William /

1130
01:10:00,126 --> 01:10:02,126
It's your fault /

1131
01:10:03,805 --> 01:10:05,805
Sorry. Wrong door.

1132
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,125
Oh you! /

1133
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:08,406
Are you sure?

1134
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:12,327
Yes, I am sure

1135
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:45,327
Nastia is me again

1136
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:47,607
Call me necessarily

1137
01:10:47,928 --> 01:10:49,928
Bear if you do not call

1138
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:52,808
Sell camomile

1139
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,208
And again, I begin to walk around behind you

1140
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:52,451
Smell smells, decided to finish with him?

1141
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:55,571
Not on

1142
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,090
Come

1143
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:58,130
There is no time

1144
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,051
Nastia leaves with his orthopedics to Canada

1145
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:02,010
And tells me to go to parents

1146
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:04,130
When?

1147
01:12:03,131 --> 01:12:05,131
After a half hour

1148
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:06,211
Well then, I plan to do to not rode

1149
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:08,611
The plan provides for 11 monthly activities ..

1150
01:12:16,851 --> 01:12:18,851
Halo Artyom you hear?

1151
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:21,091
Where are you? on the road? Super!

1152
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,212
PodwieŸ me to the airport

1153
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,130
I took the tow car

1154
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,250
They set up blockade

1155
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,290
In short, I do not have money even for a taxi

1156
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:32,692
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1157
01:12:31,652 --> 01:12:33,652

Crazy for the rest!

01:14:10,536 --> 01:14:12,536
After what you did it!

1175
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:13,975
I wanted to frighten the peasants!

1176
01:14:14,134 --> 01:14:16,134

Hello Igor!

Where are you guys?

But here in the U.S., does not drive at a red

1210
01:16:13,259 --> 01:16:15,259

What he wants us to Chernobyl to send?

1212
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:19,819
Not

1213
01:16:32,218 --> 01:16:34,218
When you're under arrest

1214
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,660
You have no right to answer the phone

1215
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:37,141
I have to answer!

1216
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,260
This is an important phone!

1217
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,980
Maybe his future wife!

01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,900
Come on, with you too man!

1219
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,180

01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:48,901
Officer, is sufficient

1221
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:50,061
Not cruelty to a boy

1222
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,180
Can not you see that love?

1223
01:16:57,621 --> 01:16:59,621

Think about that...

1228
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:11,141
Forgive you.

1229
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:21,541
What else did she say?

1230
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:23,381
She... hmmm...

1231
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,780
She asked me to give you a kiss.

1232
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,742
I hope that you said "no."

1233
01:17:27,982 --> 01:17:29,982
Not to damn it!

1234
01:17:29,141 --> 01:17:31,141
Thank God!

1235
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,542
Maybe I'll give a kiss?

1236
01:17:32,943 --> 01:17:34,943

Do not talk, so young

1242
01:19:48,706 --> 01:19:50,706
Beautiful

1243
01:19:49,587 --> 01:19:51,587
Her heart rejoices

1244

Why is that?

1248
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,267
Maybe you have some free vacancy?

1249
01:20:08,268 --> 01:20:10,268
Maybe something casual?

1250
01:20:10,067 --> 01:20:12,067
Maybe Promote your own brand?

1251
01:20:41,948 --> 01:20:43,948
