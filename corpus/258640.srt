1
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,477
<i>If it weren't for Elvia Rivero,</i>
<i>this story wouldn't even be worth telling.</i>

2
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,277
<i>Whenever Elvia</i>
<i>came to this dead old town...</i>

3
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,016
<i>well, it's like she woke the place up.</i>

4
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,621
<i>My hometown, Laramie, New Mexico,</i>
<i>it came alive.</i>

5
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,054
<i>Elvia Rivero was the one</i>
<i>who made me laugh when I needed to laugh.</i>

6
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,926
<i>She made me cry when no one was looking.</i>

7
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,400
<i>But most of all, Elvia could put into words</i>
<i>everything I was thinking.</i>

8
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,436
<i>It was Elvia who first gave me the idea.</i>

9
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,939
<i>It was decided then and there.</i>
<i>I knew what was missing from my life.</i>

10
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,543
<i>A man.</i>

11
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,084
Shit!

12
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,025
<i>Oh, no! Don't get me wrong.</i>

13
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,758
<i>Not a man for me, for my mom.</i>

14
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,423
<i>Then we could do all the dumb normal stuff</i>
<i>regular families do.</i>

15
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,348
Hi, Darius.

16
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,855
Come in.

17
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,155
I can't. I have to go meet my stupid sister.

18
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,337
Maybe I want to sit at the counter.

19
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,013
Don't worry, as soon as I'm out of here,
you can do whatever the fuck you want.

20
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,813
Promises.

21
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,386
Hello, girls.

22
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,719
- Trudi.
- Thanks.

23
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,288
I'll send your favorite waitress over as soon
as she finishes the big party in back.

24
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,097
You want something to drink?

25
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,932
Yeah, a Slice, in a big huge glass
with some ice, please.

26
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,371
- She's waiting.
- What?

27
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,405
- Diet Pepsi.
- Diet Pepsi. Okay.

28
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,145
So, where is our favorite waitress, anyway?

29
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,125
I got the most amazing idea today, Trudi.

30
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,323
Oh, man!

31
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,522
<i>- Lo siento, seòorita.</i>
- It's no problem.

32
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,567
It was an accident.

33
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,896
God, don't just stand there, wetback,
get a towel! Clean it up!

34
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,179
Glad he didn't spill it on me.
I have a date later.

35
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,012
Really? With who?

36
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,888
Nobody you'd know.

37
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,727
By the way, the name's Javier, not wetback.

38
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,204
My family's been in this town
for five generations.

39
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,872
Where is the bitch? I don't have all night.

40
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,778
The old bitch is coming.

41
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,816
She heard you. If I was you I'd just keep
my mouth shut on your date tonight.

42
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,355
You risk blowing it.

43
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,790
He's an idiot, he isn't interested
in my fucking vocabulary.

44
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,419
I didn't say "old."

45
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,856
Oh, goody.

46
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,990
Come on, girls, make it quick, I'm snowed.

47
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,967
Why are you working two stations?

48
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,433
Unlike some people, I notice.

49
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,935
Yeah, some people notice.

50
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,606
What are you gonna have?

51
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,816
A dinner salad with blue cheese dressing.
No dressing, just a lemon wedge.

52
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,783
That's it? No way.
You're having some protein, Trudi.

53
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,250
- Come on, I had protein once already today.
- Like what?

54
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,285
- You're having the fish.
- Fish? Make me sick.

55
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,255
Fine. Bring it. I won't eat anything then.

56
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,998
- What are you going to have?
- BLT with onion rings?

57
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,573
Could I get another Slice
in a big glass with ice?

58
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,771
Where is Javier?

59
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,814
- He walked.
- He walked?

60
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,877
He just walked out?

61
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,756
That's just great.

62
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:16,318
I am not going out with a beautiful boy
smelling like grease and fish. Fuck that.

63
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,690
- Where are you going?
- I'm not eating. Forget it.

64
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,562
That's just great, Trudi.

65
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,142
Eighty-six the red snapper.

66
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,145
<i>The question was,</i>
<i>what sort of man would my mom go for?</i>

67
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,278
<i>My dad walked off</i>
<i>before I could remember things.</i>

68
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,814
<i>And I hadn't seen her with any other guy</i>
<i>in almost two years...</i>

69
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,491
<i>since the one who held the gun on us.</i>

70
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,733
<i>Before him there was this rich guy who took</i>
<i>me and my sister to Kmart one day...</i>

71
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,469
<i>and let us buy anything we wanted.</i>

72
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,770
<i>And we said, "Marry him, Mom. "</i>

73
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,806
<i>But she said no because if she did,</i>
<i>it would be for the wrong reasons.</i>

74
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,842
<i>So that was the end of that.</i>

75
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:18,176
<i>Then there was this young guy.</i>
<i>He was more of a pal.</i>

76
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:23,078
<i>Now, he used to turn off all the lights</i>
<i>in the trailer and go, "Bring me the knife!"</i>

77
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,015
<i>And me and Trudi</i>
<i>would hide in the dark and scream.</i>

78
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,084
<i>Mom would get all mad at him and say:</i>

79
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,426
<i>"Stop it! You're getting them all wound up</i>
<i>before bedtime. "</i>

80
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,328
<i>And we'd all laugh so she had to laugh, too.</i>

81
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,267
<i>I wonder whatever happened to him.</i>

82
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,699
<i>There are so many kinds of guys.</i>

83
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,372
<i>There's so many kinds.</i>

84
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,936
<i>But there was only one guy missing.</i>

85
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,480
El Paso.

86
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,948
Last name, Evans...

87
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,756
- first name, John.
<i>- I have a J. Evans.</i>

88
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,623
Okay. Thank you. I'll take it.

89
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,993
<i>- Hold for the number.</i>
- Thank you.

90
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,772
<i>The only man missing</i>
<i>was John Isaiah Perion Evans...</i>

91
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,576
<i>my dad.</i>

92
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,073
<i>Hello?</i>

93
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,089
"And be sure to turn out the lights.

94
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,264
"We will.

95
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,471
"I did. She was the last one in there."

96
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,507
Where is your sister?

97
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,015
Shade, wake up and tell me where Trudi is.

98
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,656
God, Mom, I don't know.

99
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,851
I was having a good dream.

100
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,891
Go back to sleep.

101
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,841
This was amazing, Trudi.

102
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,604
You're really amazing.

103
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,981
- I'll call you tomorrow, all right?
- Okay. Yeah.

104
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,088
Now, get some sleep.

105
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,430
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

106
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,715
What? I had a date, so?

107
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,989
It's 2:30, Trudi.

108
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,124
- You haven't been to school in two weeks.
- I have too.

109
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,631
Not according to this. This is bullshit.

110
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,102
You're going to school
or you're getting your ass a job.

111
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,763
- Fine, I'll get a job.
- Doing what?

112
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,837
I don't know. God, something.

113
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,071
- Would you lay off? I'm tired.
- No, I'm not finished with you!

114
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,047
You don't come in at no 2:30 a.m.
As long as you're living in my house.

115
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,605
- You got it?
- I got it!

116
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,415
I don't know how you piss the hours away,
but I got a pretty good idea.

117
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,682
- It's none of your business.
- Oh, no?

118
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,054
Whose business is it if you get knocked up?

119
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,754
Or if you bring home a nice dose
of the clap or AIDS? Answer me that.

120
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,093
- Whose business is it then?
- Not yours!

121
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,633
I wouldn't tell you shit if I were dying!

122
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,794
Listen to me, young lady,
you got three choices:

123
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,772
You go to school, you get a job,
or you get out!

124
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,972
Fine, then, I'm out of here.
I can't stand it here with you!

125
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,407
And you don't close the door in my face!

126
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,949
Come on, I have to go to school tomorrow!

127
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,184
- You're gonna shape up around here!
- Get out of my fucking life!

128
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,326
Sweetheart. I can make you
very sorry you said that.

129
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,164
Go to bed, Mom!

130
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,942
I will go to bed when I want to,
you understand me?

131
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,533
Will the new girl come get her order?

132
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,115
Trudi, pick up.

133
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,627
Here you go.

134
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,331
- Will that be all?
- This will do. Thanks.

135
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,370
One moment.

136
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,274
- I ordered the Western Burger.
- Just a sec.

137
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,338
Shit!

138
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,175
That's his burger. You ordered
the French Burger, that's the Western...

139
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,459
Too late? It's okay.

140
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,020
- I'm sorry. It's my first day.
- It's all right.

141
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,689
I'm from England. We're used to bad service.

142
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,668
Is that supposed to make me feel good
or something?

143
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,897
Hello?

144
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,133
Anyone?

145
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,250
No! Stop!

146
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,684
Are you crazy, man?
You could lose a finger like that.

147
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,622
Sorry.

148
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,629
It's you?

149
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,535
Done any Mex bashing lately?

150
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,404
- What?
- I'm sorry.

151
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,674
You probably don't remember me.
I know all us "wetbacks" look alike.

152
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,647
I didn't say anything.

153
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,353
Wait a minute.

154
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,250
I do.

155
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,321
I do remember you.
You're the busboy who walked out.

156
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,732
You left my mom stranded at dinner rush.
God, who could forget.

157
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,136
You don't seem to be
much better at this job.

158
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,799
And in case you don't know,
most projectors have a knob for focus!

159
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,613
Goodbye, <i>chula</i>.

160
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,091
I think we've been over this
about a hundred times too many.

161
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,769
Look, Nora. Wait!

162
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,572
Come on, open up. Let me talk to you.

163
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,739
What, Raymond?

164
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,011
What's to say?

165
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,251
Maybe we could have a drink
or a cup of coffee?

166
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,515
Spend a little time together?

167
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:56,760
Julie, in all those years, never knew a thing.
We never hurt nobody.

168
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:02,393
I can't get it through your head that you're
not the only one with a family to protect.

169
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,665
My girls are grown up now.
I can't be messing with a married man.

170
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,538
I got to set some kind of example.

171
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,268
It seems to me that if I make you feel good...

172
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,507
that's the type of example
that would mean something to your girls.

173
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,482
Better than the role model
of being a lonely woman.

174
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,452
Yeah, I get lonely. I do. So, big deal.

175
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,889
Women are lonely in the '90s.
It's our new phase.

176
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,356
We'll live.

177
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,122
I've been lonelier.

178
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,472
You take care.
And take care of those girls of yours.

179
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,406
I still want to meet them one day.

180
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,074
It's nice to see you.

181
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,132
You are so beautiful.

182
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,937
I got to go.

183
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,585
Shit!

184
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,851
She's so beautiful.

185
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,757
I mean, the words:

186
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,492
"Have to believe we are magic."

187
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,760
It's tripped out.

188
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:51,369
She's proposing some very weird, cool,
and scary shit.

189
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,671
Like what?

190
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,582
Like that feminine shit.

191
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,517
Going further than love.

192
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,953
Further than sex.

193
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,596
Like death.

194
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,233
Like, <i>Don't Fear the Reaper</i>.

195
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:25,140
The way I see it, chicks are the ones
who want to go to outer space.

196
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,769
That's why they push it so hard.

197
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,111
It's like Adam and Eve.

198
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,876
He was fine grooving in Paradise...

199
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,349
but Eve wanted something scary.

200
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,117
She wanted the fucking edge.

201
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,631
She wanted to jump off cliffs
just so she could see what it was like to fall.

202
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,394
Risk.

203
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,066
That's what this song's all about, Shade.

204
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,439
That's what Eve wanted.

205
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,077
That's what Olivia wants.

206
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,047
And that's what I want.

207
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,261
- Has anybody seen Brett tonight?
- Who? Brett?

208
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,529
Yeah, I think I have seen Brett.

209
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,905
- Really? Is he here?
- I think his fiancée's giving him head.

210
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,347
I'm sorry, that's your job, isn't it?

211
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,575
- He says you swallow, Trudi. Is that true?
- Fuck you!

212
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,915
Stick around.
You want Brett, there he is, right there.

213
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,752
"I'll call you tomorrow, Trudi.

214
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,555
"Yeah, baby. No one's ever made me come
that way before."

215
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,688
That was really cute.

216
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,062
- What are you trying to do to me?
- What are you trying to do to me?

217
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,164
Nothing.

218
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,772
I'd kick you in the balls if you had any.

219
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,280
What's her problem?

220
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,944
She's pissed
because I won't go out with her.

221
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,687
Could you fill this for me, please?

222
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,814
- Cream and lots of sugar.
- Sure.

223
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,584
Okey-doke. Here you go.

224
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,694
Thanks.

225
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,520
Your thermos!

226
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,085
Wait!

227
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,156
I know the coffee sucks here,
but that's a nice thermos.

228
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,837
My mind just walks away sometimes.

229
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,538
Yeah. That's what men do, they walk away.

230
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,570
Wait.

231
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,574
- Can I give you a lift?
- What for?

232
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,610
For you to explain that remark.

233
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,854
Their emotions walk away.
Their minds walk away.

234
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,228
Everything they say to you walks away.

235
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,324
Make a left up here.

236
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,264
Their promises walk away.

237
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,671
- I saw you had this earlier. What is it?
- It's a mineral light.

238
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:59,183
It's like a lantern,
only it has an ultraviolet light in it. See?

239
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,358
- Look at your shirt.
- Look at your dress.

240
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,756
So, what? Is this your method?

241
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,893
You get girls in your car and show them
you can make them glow in the dark?

242
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,936
It's a necessary instrument for my work.

243
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,838
Make a right up here.

244
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,177
What's that?

245
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,610
Rocks.

246
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,346
I knew it. Another musician, great.

247
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,051
Not rock.

248
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:42,852
Rocks.

249
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,629
Look, that's the best I can do. I'm tired.

250
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,738
Yeah, sure.

251
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,045
Have fun with your rocks.

252
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,558
Excuse me.

253
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,963
- Mornin'.
- Morning?

254
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,835
No, it's not even morning yet,
get my meaning?

255
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,180
No, you don't.
I'll be direct. This is my day off...

256
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,413
and like most people,
I like to sleep in on my day off.

257
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,747
You following me?

258
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,685
What the hell are you doing,
making all this racket at 5:00 a.m.?

259
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,694
Installing a brand-new
Humphrey satellite dish, ma'am.

260
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,232
I can see that.

261
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,332
But I'd advise you...

262
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,802
that if you don't do this
at a reasonable hour, I'll have to call...

263
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,706
Mr. Humphrey-Satellite-Dish and complain.

264
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,801
But, ma'am, I am Mr. Humphrey.

265
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,638
But, I tell you what, I'll go.

266
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,842
I'll stop working for a spell
and go eat some breakfast.

267
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,243
You'd be welcome to join me.

268
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,950
It's a place right off the highway.
It's a Pull-Off Plaza.

269
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,990
No, thanks.

270
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,920
But I'll give the cook a call
and tell him you're coming.

271
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,296
If he's in a good mood,
maybe he'll spit in your eggs for me.

272
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,970
That's a good one.

273
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,763
Say, what's your name, anyhow?

274
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,939
Nora. Why?

275
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,143
Bet you can't guess what my name is.

276
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,541
You go ahead, try.

277
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,913
I don't know. Tom? Dick?

278
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,151
Moose?

279
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,255
You'll never guess in a million years.
You want me to tell you?

280
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,120
Hamlet.

281
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,723
Hamlet Humphrey.

282
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,358
That's pitiful.

283
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,566
Mom, do you have a pair of hose
I can borrow?

284
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,607
They are in my drawer.

285
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,484
Mom, do you want
blankets and sheets, too?

286
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,415
- Of course.
- Would you move? I'm gonna be late.

287
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:36,482
Who used all the tampons
and didn't buy a new box?

288
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,122
Not me.

289
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,754
I'm the dominant female in this house.
You're both following my cycle.

290
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,132
You get your period first. You're all bad.

291
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,599
I bought some. They're under the sink.

292
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,107
- What's this?
- Give it! That's mine!

293
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,912
- Birth control pills?
- You bitch! I'm gonna tell Mom.

294
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,453
- I'm gonna tell Mommy!
- Just give it back!

295
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,857
- You jerk! Stop laughing!
- I'm not.

296
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,566
- Why did you hit her?
- I didn't. She fell.

297
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,298
- Not till she pushed me.
- She kicked me.

298
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,066
I can always depend on you
to cause trouble.

299
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,938
Big baby.

300
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,472
- Is this the only size you have?
- That's it, hon.

301
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,979
- How much is it?
- $2.25 and tax.

302
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,223
Bummer. I have $2.

303
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,858
How much you need?

304
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,455
Just $0.30.

305
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,797
Take it.

306
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,638
I can pay you back. My mom's just in there.

307
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,507
No sweat.

308
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,540
John's a big spender. Ladies' man.
Too young for you, John.

309
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,522
Thanks. I'll be right back with your change.

310
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,286
- Don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

311
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,999
So, where's this go, Sadie?

312
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,416
<i>Mom used to say that the easiest place</i>
<i>to meet a guy was a bar.</i>

313
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,255
<i>To me, this sounded crazy.</i>

314
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,064
<i>Then one night, I saw him.</i>

315
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,568
<i>The one I'd been looking for.</i>

316
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,231
<i>It was like he walked</i>
<i>straight out of an Elvia Rivero movie.</i>

317
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,573
<i>I could tell he was no loser.</i>

318
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,109
<i>He had on the clothes of a teamster</i>
<i>and boots from Spain...</i>

319
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,414
<i>or at least El Paso.</i>

320
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,958
<i>He was the one, beyond a doubt.</i>

321
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,035
<i>I just have to get him and my mom together.</i>

322
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,780
- I was hoping it was you.
- Let's go.

323
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,620
Fuck them!

324
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,802
- Am I taking you home?
- Can I go with you?

325
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,739
I'll be working. And it's dangerous.

326
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,501
You're not really dressed for it.

327
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,507
I could wait in the Jeep for you. I'll be okay.

328
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,340
Okay. I won't be long.

329
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,199
I don't like this shit.

330
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,380
- Dank?
- Careful.

331
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,748
Walk to me, slowly.

332
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,030
You dropped these.

333
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,633
Thank you.

334
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,911
- I always thought there was nothing here.
- Nothing here?

335
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,514
There's so much.

336
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,323
Look at this.

337
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,587
And these.

338
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,962
There's something I've got to tell you.

339
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,197
Do you want to hear it?

340
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,135
- Is it going to upset me?
- No.

341
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,212
Is it going to make me sick?

342
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,177
- Is it going to make me kill someone?
- No.

343
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,679
All right, then.

344
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,395
I mess around with guys a lot.

345
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,237
I guess I'm one of those girls with a rep.

346
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,773
I never wanted to do it, but I do.

347
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,181
I even make all the first moves.

348
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,348
But I've been thinking about it a lot lately
and thinking about...

349
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,390
why I can't say no...

350
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,561
and why I always have to do it.

351
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,437
And I think it's because of my first time.

352
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,466
These guys just did what they wanted.

353
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,646
What are you saying?

354
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,018
They pulled a train on me.
They gang-banged me.

355
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:43,130
I didn't report it. Are you crazy?
Let the whole town know about it?

356
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,371
I never told anyone. Not even my mom.

357
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,816
I knew their names.
Two of them were brothers...

358
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,788
Sonny and Dan Richardson,
and Ralph Ellison.

359
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,787
A guy they called Tex.

360
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,057
I never saw them again.

361
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,027
Don't.

362
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,170
After that, I never said no again.

363
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,979
Why bother? They just do it anyway.

364
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,962
This was the first time...

365
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,036
I really wanted to do it.

366
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,500
It was the first time...

367
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,633
I felt anything.

368
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,773
I have to go away for a few days.

369
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,672
There's a mineshaft near Carlsbad
that has some rare species of rocks.

370
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,176
I want to check it out.

371
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:48,116
What? It's not that far.
I'll be back by Wednesday.

372
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,860
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

373
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,569
Don't be like that.

374
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,375
Come here.

375
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,882
Kiss me.

376
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,363
I'll dream about you.

377
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,198
Dream for me, Trudi.

378
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,695
You have one month
to find another place to live.

379
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,570
Fine.

380
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,517
- It's fine, is it?
- Yes, it's fine. It's dandy.

381
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,709
- Now leave me alone.
- Leave you alone?

382
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,378
You bet I'll leave you alone.

383
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,549
Pay your rent alone.
See how "dandy" that is.

384
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,260
I won't be alone! Not like you!

385
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,024
I found someone
and he wants to be with me!

386
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,759
Yeah, sure he does.

387
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:41,335
One month, Trudi.
I will not put up with this anymore!

388
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,765
Bitch!

389
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,255
Ungrateful...

390
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,889
Hamlet Humphrey, you still here?

391
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,221
Yes, ma'am. I'm in it for the long haul.

392
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,522
Aren't we lucky.

393
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,128
Thanks. I'll wash it for you.

394
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,308
Now, it can't be that bad.

395
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,408
Now, how do you know?

396
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,082
What if I told you I was dying...

397
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,011
of an incurable blood disease,
would that be bad enough for you?

398
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,648
I was just trying to cheer you up.
I wasn't out to minimize it.

399
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:13,025
<i>... this weekend, go kick some booty with</i>
<i>those cowboys. It'll be wild. Don't miss it.</i>

400
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,793
<i>Closer to home, sunny skies</i>
<i>prevailing this morning. A hot day...</i>

401
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,111
I don't want you to move out.

402
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,051
Sorry we woke you up.

403
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,415
What is that?

404
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,762
Looks like an ordinary rock, huh?

405
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,530
- Yeah, plain old rock.
- It's not.

406
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,531
It glows bright orange under a special light.

407
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,473
- Bullshit, it does.
- It's true.

408
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,641
Shady, I met the best guy.

409
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,745
Laramie's not so bad.

410
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,515
We went to the desert, Dank and me,
and he showed me it's alive out there.

411
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,488
It's not just nothing.

412
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,125
Colors and sounds and flowers and...

413
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,896
I need your advice.

414
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,769
There's a boy.

415
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,678
And he does all this stuff.

416
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,383
Like he touches my face
and he holds my hand...

417
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,123
and he acts like we're buddies.

418
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,354
You have to make the first move.

419
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,893
What's his dream girl like?

420
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,996
This is gonna be fun.

421
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:11,841
<i>You decide, that's all, that you're going</i>
<i>to have him and nothing can stop you.</i>

422
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,315
<i>Throw him down. Make him want you.</i>

423
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,871
You look amazing.

424
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,588
Know what I've been thinking?

425
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,329
No, what?

426
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,170
I've been thinking how bored I am.

427
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,239
How I want to go to some...

428
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,702
scary, dark place.

429
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,273
Risk, Darius.

430
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,846
I want to jump off cliffs.

431
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,924
I want to go to another planet.

432
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,086
That's some scary shit, all right.

433
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:47,004
- Am I hurting your leg?
- No. I don't feel a thing.

434
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,236
Good, I guess.

435
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,139
- Okay, where was I?
- I can't remember.

436
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,377
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.

437
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,243
Magic, Darius.

438
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,914
That's what Olivia wants.

439
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,726
That's what Eve wanted.

440
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,817
That's what I want.

441
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,556
I wanna lose myself...

442
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,664
in you.

443
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,876
Oh, God! I feel so stupid!

444
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,482
No. Come on. Why?

445
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,543
- Am I ugly? I mean, am I gross?
- Get real, Shade.

446
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,157
You're a beautiful person, but...

447
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,986
- But I'm hideous.
- Stop.

448
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,195
I feel like a jerk.

449
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,070
It's not you.

450
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,534
It's me.

451
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,069
That doesn't help.

452
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,677
All right. You have a good one, baby.

453
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,242
See you, man.

454
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,829
It's the movie lady.

455
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,126
No movies today?

456
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,768
No matinees?

457
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,240
Just real life?

458
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,614
Real life.

459
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,049
What'd you do to your hair?

460
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:16,819
I don't like it.

461
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:21,119
And those are some lame-ass shoes.
No wonder your feet hurt...

462
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:25,262
- trying to walk on those building blocks.
- Who asked you?

463
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,200
I mean, if you ask me, you dress pretty silly.

464
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,068
Stupid baggy '50s pants with the little cut
in the side. What's that for?

465
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:42,073
Come on, now. I'm just joking with you.

466
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:47,314
It's 'cause I like the way
you normally dress, that's why.

467
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,583
I liked your hair before.

468
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,089
It was just fine.

469
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,993
That's the stuff.

470
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,437
- Slow down.
- All right.

471
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,412
It's that one. Right there.

472
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,654
See you at the movies, I guess.

473
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,926
Do you want this?

474
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,864
It wouldn't mean nothing.

475
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,799
No, that's okay.

476
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,399
- See you.
- Bye.

477
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,579
Oh, shit! Dinner.

478
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,831
Mom?

479
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,988
Shady, honey, are we going to eat or what?

480
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,564
Mom, I have a little surprise for you.

481
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,903
- Come on in.
- You look great.

482
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,116
Nora, this is Raymond.
Raymond, this is Nora.

483
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,892
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

484
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,540
What line of work are you in, Ms. Evans?

485
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,179
Please call me Nora.

486
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:36,221
I'm a brain surgeon, Raymond.
How about you?

487
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,327
I'm a grave digger myself.

488
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,091
I'm digging my own as we speak... rapidly.

489
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,029
That makes two things you do quick.

490
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,146
Thanks for coming over.

491
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,379
You really blew it.

492
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:08,490
Maybe if you play your cards right,
I can get you a second chance.

493
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,287
Well, darling, I think
I about run out of chances with her.

494
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,860
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

495
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,734
That's a sweet little girl you got there.

496
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,739
I'm lucky.

497
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,101
I'm lucky, too...

498
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,012
to have known you both.

499
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,752
I'll be cutting out for Las Cruces now.

500
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,922
Stay well, Raymond.

501
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,674
<i>Things don't always work out</i>
<i>like you want them to...</i>

502
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:05,145
<i>and in my experience, it almost never does.</i>

503
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:10,017
<i>A lot of people say you're stupid</i>
<i>to have expectations on anything.</i>

504
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,214
<i>But they're just afraid of disappointment.</i>

505
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:18,422
<i>Me, I guess I'm more afraid</i>
<i>of not having any daydreams left.</i>

506
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,464
<i>I mean, disappointment is easy.</i>
<i>You can get over it.</i>

507
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,963
<i>But what do you do with yourself...</i>

508
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,404
<i>if you can't imagine the future,</i>
<i>the way you want it to be?</i>

509
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,978
<i>When someone rejects you,</i>
<i>they say that it's not personal.</i>

510
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,317
<i>Who are they kidding?</i>
<i>It's as personal as it can get.</i>

511
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,954
<i>You can't help but take it personal.</i>

512
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:58,363
<i>You start thinking that you're</i>
<i>the worst problem in their whole life.</i>

513
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,892
<i>You think you're the reason</i>
<i>for all their weird moods.</i>

514
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,505
<i>Or why they quit coming to school.</i>

515
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,861
<i>Wednesday came and Trudi</i>
<i>was too nervous to even talk...</i>

516
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,463
<i>'cause that Dank guy was coming back.</i>

517
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,341
<i>Then Thursday came...</i>

518
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:45,205
<i>and then by Friday, she'd gotten all quiet.</i>

519
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,488
<i>Come the next week,</i>
<i>she couldn't even get out of bed.</i>

520
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,418
<i>"He's never coming back, " she said.</i>

521
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,712
Who's the father?

522
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,478
I don't know.

523
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,583
Nice.

524
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,292
A guy, okay?

525
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:33,923
A jerk.

526
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,762
We need to sit down with this jerk
and talk over the details.

527
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,634
If you can find him.

528
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,769
I have nothing to say to him.

529
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,038
Be practical, Trudi.

530
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,606
He's got to pay for it. It's only fair.

531
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,639
You're the one who has to go through
the abortion. It's the least he can do.

532
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,878
Abortion?

533
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,148
I haven't even decided yet
what I'm going to do.

534
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,418
There's nothing to decide.
You have no choice.

535
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,653
Bullshit! You can't tell me.

536
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:07,622
You gonna finish that?

537
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,393
This is my body.
You can't tell me what to do.

538
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,863
I'm not gonna discuss this with you, Trudi.

539
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,802
You don't want me to make
the same mistake you made, right?

540
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,636
You wish you'd had an abortion
instead of having me.

541
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,370
Life would have been easier for you.
Just fucking say it!

542
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,242
That's enough, Trudi! Now get in the car!

543
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,673
I bet you even tried to abort me, didn't you?

544
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,760
<i>Everything in Trudi's life</i>
<i>came down to three choices...</i>

545
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,593
<i>and this was no different.</i>

546
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:46,465
<i>Moving to a home in Dallas,</i>
<i>carrying the baby all those months...</i>

547
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,869
<i>then having to give it away</i>
<i>seemed like the hardest part of all.</i>

548
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,305
<i>Still, it was her choice.</i>

549
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,751
You won't be gone for that long.

550
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:43,453
Nah. I'll be back before you can blink.

551
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:47,052
So don't get too cozy
in that room by yourself, okay?

552
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,865
Take care of yourself, Trudi.

553
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,071
I'm gonna miss you.

554
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,175
Bye. Be good.

555
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,182
Here. Take it.

556
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,584
You just made me so mad.

557
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,297
<i>Bus 1737 leaving for Dallas, now boarding.</i>

558
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,971
That guy, Darius...

559
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,945
he just got scared. It wasn't you.

560
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,792
Mom, what are we going to do
without Trudi here?

561
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,602
The house is so quiet.

562
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,838
You know, you and I never talk.

563
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,182
You done?

564
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,665
Maybe we should get some more TV.

565
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,605
I'll see you inside, all right, homes.

566
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,873
- How are you?
- All right.

567
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:26,120
I thought it was you.
I came in the door and I looked at you...

568
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:31,126
and I said, "Yeah, that's her.
No one in my town dresses like that."

569
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,588
- See you later, man.
- Right on. See you later. Take it easy.

570
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,700
You will not believe it.

571
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,329
You see that guy over there?
His brother is a DJ from LA.

572
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:45,841
Like a big millionaire and famous.
And he's passing through town...

573
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,469
and he promised me
he would ask him to DJ at the party.

574
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,340
Really? That's great.

575
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,777
This party is turning out so perfect.

576
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,545
Now, who else can I invite?

577
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,153
I'm sorry, I can't invite the whole town.

578
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,863
Hey, no need to explain.

579
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:16,131
<i>A rato.</i>

580
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,972
You shouldn't even be talking to that boy.

581
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,276
He is a <i>cholo</i>. Pure gangster.

582
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,450
You know, he's probably supporting
a baby or two...

583
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:32,954
by robbing pizza delivery men
and stealing car radios.

584
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,854
You don't even know him, Tanya.

585
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,457
He's not all that bad.

586
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:41,963
<i>Cholos</i> are all the same, Shade.
They deal dope.

587
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,860
They kill each other for fun.

588
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,994
They gang-rape girls and that's how
the girls are initiated into the gang.

589
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:55,343
Now, let's find me the perfect dress, okay?

590
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,246
So, you get your network programming...

591
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,943
get your cable programming,
but that's only the beginning.

592
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,580
This is not just entertainment.

593
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:08,716
Now you're gonna get philosophical on me?

594
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:12,386
Spare me the lecture and talk to me
in a language I can understand.

595
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,190
How much is it gonna cost?

596
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:18,165
Just $1,200 to be linked up
with your fellas all over the world.

597
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,632
I can't afford that.

598
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,173
A woman that works as hard as you?

599
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:34,743
You've had a tough go of it.
You know, a fella's got to admire that.

600
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,951
Hey, you've got some pretty brown eyes
on you, you know that?

601
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,254
Thanks. But I still can't afford it.

602
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,293
Maybe TV just ain't what you need, lady.

603
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:59,302
So, you're a DJ. Must be very interesting.

604
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,546
What about that liquor delivery?

605
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,480
Well, why don't we call again?

606
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,342
I'm sorry if I didn't...

607
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:37,535
do it for you.

608
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:42,873
You do it for me, Ham. It was great. Really.

609
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,885
It was really great. I mean it.

610
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,951
I can enjoy myself without...

611
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,124
I mean, not every time, but...

612
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:02,094
Well, I still got some ambition left.
I can make it better.

613
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,305
It was fine.

614
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,501
It really was.

615
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,345
I think it has to do
with getting used to a man...

616
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,681
getting used to his body...

617
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,456
position...

618
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,458
the size.

619
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,995
Oh, the size is great.

620
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,196
The body's great.

621
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,267
That just leaves position.

622
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:42,411
Okay, so it should be here? Thank you.

623
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:46,245
Okay, so it should be here? Thank you.

624
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,917
- They're on the way.
- Come on, baby, I won't bite.

625
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:09,063
Look, it was really nice meeting you guys...

626
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:13,040
but my parents could be home any minute,
so you should probably leave.

627
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,413
You guys have to go!

628
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,510
Get out of my house, now!

629
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,018
Go! Just go!

630
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,990
Okay, enough of this bullshit.
Let's go back inside...

631
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,359
You guys have to go. Out of my house!

632
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:39,524
She doesn't have to do anything with you.
Just leave her alone.

633
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:42,628
Look at the mouth on her. Let's see...

634
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,696
That's enough, pal!

635
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:56,141
So, where are we taking you?
The picture show?

636
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,179
No. I live out on Route 40.

637
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,918
The Lucky Clover Trailer Park.

638
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,160
How did you know that?

639
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,298
I've been trying to get the nerve up
to come and see you...

640
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,802
since I came back home to Laramie.

641
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,967
How you doing, Shady Lynne?

642
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,439
How's your sister, Trudi?

643
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,680
Is she okay?

644
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:29,781
And Nora?

645
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,712
Dear, sweet, pretty Nora.

646
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,753
How is your mamma?

647
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,096
John, do we have the same last name?

648
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,905
I'm him.

649
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,605
I ain't shit...

650
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,914
but I'm your old man, darling.

651
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,947
How was the party, honey?

652
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,786
I met my dad.

653
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,456
He's moved back?

654
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,330
That's the first I heard about it. When?

655
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:35,037
Look, I don't know.
I was shocked. I didn't ask him that.

656
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,840
Well, there are a few things
I'd like to ask him.

657
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,376
It's impossible.

658
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:46,444
I would have heard about it.
I mean, this is a small town.

659
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,924
He doesn't live in town.

660
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,959
He lives out near Rockhound Park.

661
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,928
Oh, great.

662
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,732
And he doesn't even bother to call us?

663
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:02,635
He just stalks us
like the coward he always was.

664
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,707
I knew I shouldn't have told you anything.

665
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,436
I mean, this whole time
I have been trying to help you find him!

666
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,782
Here, let me put some aloe vera on it.

667
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,755
No! Just leave me alone!

668
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,452
Don't you see? It's all your fault!

669
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:32,728
- That you burned yourself?
- No! Don't you understand?

670
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,068
That we don't have a family!

671
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,735
You just hate men!

672
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,372
That's what I think. You just hate them!

673
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,856
That's just great.
I can see him being sincere.

674
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,522
"Oh, my darling. Where have you been?"

675
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,165
Well, we've been here.

676
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,002
I'm looking for a Mr. John Evans.

677
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,603
What for? What's he done this time?

678
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,881
Nothing. I just...

679
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,083
You one of his kids?

680
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,525
Well, for heaven's sake, come on in.

681
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,285
- John?
- What?

682
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,454
Trudi's here.

683
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,596
- I'm Shade.
- Not Trudi, Shade.

684
01:16:57,079 --> 01:17:00,446
Well, Shady Lynne, how are you?

685
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,814
Sit down.

686
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,385
Kim, get her some pop, honey.

687
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:15,163
- Do you want something to eat?
- No. I'm fine.

688
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,860
- I'll fix you a BLT.
- That will be good.

689
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,700
- Did you meet Kim?
- Hi, I'm Kim.

690
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:25,696
Nice to meet you.

691
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,746
What a surprise. Never know, do you?

692
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,929
John, I need to ask a favor of you.

693
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,230
My sister Trudi, she's away.

694
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:59,369
And it's nothing for you
to worry about or anything, but...

695
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:03,806
there's this really special nightgown
I want to buy her...

696
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:09,276
and I can pay you back. I'll work.
I'll pay you a little bit back, each week.

697
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,078
I can't let you pay back.

698
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,784
How much you need?

699
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:17,986
A lot.

700
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,792
About $50.

701
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,465
No problem.

702
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,232
You wait right here.

703
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:36,343
I think we better talk.

704
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:43,609
- How much you got in your purse?
- You know how much I got in my purse.

705
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,653
You got $23. What about the mattress?

706
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,985
You are not getting it out. How will we live?

707
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:51,116
- We got our own problems.
- That girl out there's my daughter.

708
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,458
- What about my kids?
- I'll be damned if I'm not gonna give it.

709
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,123
- Do you give a damn about my kids?
- That's not my problem.

710
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,258
Is that how it's gonna be?
Not your problem?

711
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,598
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Lf you get a job...

712
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,638
and keep it, we wouldn't live like dogs.

713
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:06,765
You are not getting in there.
John, that is my money, too!

714
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,367
God damn it, John! Stop it!

715
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,209
Go on, take it.

716
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,186
Are you sure it's all right?

717
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,313
I got the money, didn't I?

718
01:19:57,058 --> 01:20:00,391
- Thank you.
- Your ma's done a great job.

719
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:05,732
I meant to come and see you all, you girls...

720
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:12,167
but the more I waited,
the harder it got to face.

721
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:16,333
Sure thought about you, though.
Not a day's gone by.

722
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:24,176
Anyway, sure glad I could help.

723
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,903
Is Javier here?

724
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,183
Oh, hey. What's up?

725
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:39,557
- I'm sorry. I woke you up.
- It's all right.

726
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,756
This is Shade.

727
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,733
This is my mom, Rocio.

728
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,527
What's up?

729
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:18,424
- How was the party?
- Terrible.

730
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:23,363
My friend, Tanya,
she's a really good person...

731
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:26,935
but she judges people she doesn't know.

732
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,104
She thinks you're dangerous.

733
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,247
Like what does she say?

734
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,579
- She says you're a <i>cholo</i>.
- A <i>cholo</i>?

735
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,319
She says you rob and even kill people.

736
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,391
So, why are you laughing?

737
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,429
- Stupid!
- Shit, I had you going!

738
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,333
Oh, thank you.

739
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,431
Watch your ears.

740
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:40,275
She can't hear the music
but she can feel the vibrations...

741
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,839
that loud music makes on the floor.

742
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:14,212
No, I can't dance. Really, I can't.

743
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:50,140
<i>You should feel beautiful...</i>

744
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,379
<i>every day...</i>

745
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,216
<i>every day more beautiful...</i>

746
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,582
<i>because you are so beautiful...</i>

747
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,250
<i>and kind.</i>

748
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,897
<i>I want to kiss you a million times...</i>

749
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,901
<i>in a million different parts.</i>

750
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:22,781
<i>For days.</i>

751
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,075
<i>For weeks.</i>

752
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:27,887
<i>For months.</i>

753
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,854
<i>For years.</i>

754
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:34,858
<i>For life.</i>

755
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,088
<i>It was the same for both of us.</i>

756
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,286
<i>It was like we'd finally met our twin.</i>

757
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:07,183
<i>Can you grasp that?</i>

758
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:10,095
<i>Here we were, from two different worlds...</i>

759
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,198
<i>and yet, when we were alone...</i>

760
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:16,593
<i>together we made up the same person.</i>

761
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,606
<i>In his arms, I knew who I was.</i>

762
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,507
<i>Shade. Just Shade.</i>

763
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,408
<i>And that was more than enough.</i>

764
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,691
Where did you get this guy?

765
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,464
He owns his own satellite dish company.

766
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:52,202
That guy?

767
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,774
You are good.

768
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,947
Oh, brother.

769
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,496
You come bowling much, Shade?

770
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,198
I'll bet you're one of those matinee junkies.

771
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:27,937
I've seen you leaving that Spanish theater.

772
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:32,502
How do you understand those movies,
anyway? You know...

773
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:39,279
"I told you once, put down the girl.
Hand me the gold."

774
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:43,150
Or Elvia Rivero.

775
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,387
<i>"Te quiero. "</i>

776
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,260
You know of Elvia Rivero?

777
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:54,028
<i>Oh, sí. Es muy bonita. Es verdad?</i>

778
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,135
Your mamma looks just like her.

779
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:17,650
<i>Okay, honey, that's it.</i>

780
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:22,056
<i>- I'll dream about you.</i>
- Breathe.

781
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,887
<i>- I'll dream about you.</i>
- Breathe.

782
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,987
<i>- Dream for me, Trudi.</i>
- Push, Trudi, push!

783
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,229
Push!

784
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:42,207
Trudi! It's coming! Push!

785
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,777
Push! It's coming!

786
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,647
Oh, honey, that's it.

787
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,662
I'm so proud of you.

788
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:22,782
<i>The baby had lips just like Trudi.</i>

789
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:28,255
<i>Maybe she would have her same smile.</i>
<i>Or maybe she would have Dank's eyes.</i>

790
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:32,824
<i>Or maybe she would have</i>
<i>raised her eyebrows just like my mom.</i>

791
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,561
<i>Maybe when she started to talk...</i>

792
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:38,429
<i>her voice would sound like mine.</i>

793
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:43,197
<i>She'll grow up with her new mom in Dallas.</i>

794
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:47,697
<i>And she will never see</i>
<i>where any of her features came from.</i>

795
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,173
<i>She will never know Laramie...</i>

796
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:53,573
<i>or the desert where she was conceived.</i>

797
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:58,651
<i>She will never know us.</i>

798
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,995
This is my sister, Shade. This is lvy.

799
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:13,124
We're gonna be roommates
as soon as I get out.

800
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,130
Nice to meet you.

801
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,074
You guys don't look a thing alike.

802
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:25,176
Well, I got to dash. Hang in there.

803
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:27,874
I'm sure you'll feel much better
when those stitches heal.

804
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,510
You'll be able to wear cool clothes again,
and lingerie.

805
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,394
Are you really gonna stay here
in Dallas, Trudi?

806
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:42,929
You bet I am.

807
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,831
Ivy's a model. She's great looking.

808
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,461
Her agent's all excited about me.
She thinks I've got it.

809
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:55,074
What about me and Mom?

810
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,907
We really miss you, you know.

811
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:03,446
Laramie's a shit hole. There's nothing there.

812
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:06,615
There is something there.

813
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:09,987
Yeah. A lot of bad memories.

814
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,960
The desert, Trudi.

815
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:20,991
It's just like you said.

816
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:25,003
It's alive. It's magic. That's not nothing.

817
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:29,372
It was all bullshit.

818
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:33,071
This is a rock.
A fucking, ugly, pointless rock!

819
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:35,707
Get it through your head,
I'm not going back, Shade.

820
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:57,268
Just tell me you're coming home.

821
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:58,805
No, I'm not!

822
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:01,869
Just go!

823
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:51,690
<i>I'm sitting at my window</i>

824
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,023
<i>Wonderin' if those sparkling stars</i>

825
01:33:57,331 --> 01:34:01,734
<i>Shine upon that same sweet you</i>

826
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:06,301
<i>Or is your sky a rainbow</i>

827
01:34:06,374 --> 01:34:09,810
<i>Filled with colored neon lights?</i>

828
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,373
"Natural day-glo rocks."

829
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:40,164
I'll walk home.

830
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,320
Where is he?

831
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:02,390
You monster!

832
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:06,957
You're the one who ditched my sister
and gave her a rock just like these!

833
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:12,763
I think you got me confused
with someone else.

834
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,831
Your name's Dank, right?

835
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:18,105
Cecil.

836
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,678
Where did you get these rocks?

837
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,718
Well, they were sort of given to us...

838
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:27,215
by this British rock hunter.

839
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:31,657
We just spent two days at Carlsbad...

840
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:36,254
waiting for the bats
to return to the caves from Mexico.

841
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:39,391
The bats migrate back in February.

842
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:45,372
<i>Driving back, we spotted this Jeep</i>
<i>parked at this abandoned mine.</i>

843
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,337
<i>My lady, Persi, said:</i>

844
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:53,278
<i>"Hey, Cecil, it's the Jeep of that fella</i>
<i>who came in looking for day-glo rocks. "</i>

845
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:57,681
<i>We went looking for him,</i>
<i>but it was empty out there.</i>

846
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:15,862
<i>He'd been there for a week when</i>
<i>they dragged him out of the mineshaft.</i>

847
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:20,798
<i>They sent his body</i>
<i>and everything but these back to England.</i>

848
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:30,016
His girlfriend just had a little baby girl.

849
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:34,784
Here, take this.

850
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:36,986
This one's got four colors.

851
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:09,713
<i>He didn't leave her.</i>

852
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:12,520
<i>And now, after all that has happened...</i>

853
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,692
<i>it was the single gesture...</i>

854
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:17,925
<i>the one true heart</i>
<i>which has already changed the paths...</i>
