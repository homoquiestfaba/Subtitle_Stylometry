00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,500
[men shouting indistinctly]

00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,625
[horse neighs]

3
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:52,958
[horse neighs]

4
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,458
[men shouting and wailing]

00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,375
[horse neighs]

00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,458
[man groaning]

7
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,500
[man continues groaning]

8
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:13,833
Where go you, my friend?

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,750
[panting]

10
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,458
You're crawling in the wrong direction.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,583
That wind you feel is coming from England.

12
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,666
Scotland's that way.

13
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:34,708
[exhales]

14
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,708
[man groans]

15
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,291
- [man groans]
- [stabs sword]

16
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,541
- [grunts]
- [stabs sword]

17
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,708
[sighs]

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
[grunts]

19
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,916
[breathing heavily]

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,875
[horses neighing]

21
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,000
[loud thud in the distance]

22
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,083
[dog barks]

23
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,708
[man coughing]

24
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,083
[man continues coughing]

25
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,041
[man continues coughing]

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
My lords.

27
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,125
I'm most sorry for making you wait.

28
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,291
I know you've traveled far
and from great travail.

29
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,333
I pray you will know
that this time of civil unrest...

30
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,333
[inhales deeply]

31
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,708
consumes me...

32
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,750
day and night.

33
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,541
I understand...

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,125
battle with the rebel Scots
was hard fought.

35
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,166
It was, my liege.

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,000
- We lost some 300 men.
- [exhales deeply]

37
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,083
[praying in Latin]

38
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,625
- Amen.
- [men] Amen.

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,083
[sniffs, clears throat]

40
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,083
Good Hotspur...

41
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,458
you led the charge.

42
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,208
Were any prisoners of note taken?

43
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,666
Many.

44
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,333
- Are they in train?
- No.

45
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,368
[King Henry IV clears throat]

46
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,958
And why is that? Why have they not been
brought to me directly?

47
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,291
Why will you not pay
cousin Mortimer's ransom?

48
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,458
You'll need to speak up, my boy.

49
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,625
I'm an old man.

50
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,166
My ears...

51
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,041
are filled with hair.

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,625
Cousin Mortimer is held
by the rebels of Wales.

53
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,125
Why do you refuse to pay his ransom?

54
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,083
[King Henry IV clears throat, sniffs]

55
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,125
I refuse to pay Mortimer's ransom

56
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,888
because I refuse
to believe him a prisoner.

57
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,041
I rather believe Mortimer a traitor.

58
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,500
He has joined the Welsh rebels.

59
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,916
He has betrayed England
and is now an enemy of mine,

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,750
and, therefore, of yours.

61
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,833
You agree with my <i>pr√©cis, </i>young Hotspur?

62
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,142
- No.
- [Northumberland] My son...

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,392
I believe yours to be the ramblings
of a crazy old demon.

64
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,916
Harry, please, stop this.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,916
[King Henry IV] Oh, no, let him speak.

66
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,041
- I wish to hear him.
- [Northumberland] My liege...

67
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,000
Yours are the ramblings of an old man
so saturated with malice and mistrust

68
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,750
that he no longer knows up from down,

69
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
can no longer see beyond the walls
of his own monstrous <i>schloss.</i>

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,041
My family have served you.

71
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,778
We aided you in your ascension,
and still we fight for you.

72
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,233
Cousin Mortimer has fought for you.

73
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,291
And yet, now, whilst you slobber
over that chicken's wing,

74
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,708
he shivers in a western prison

75
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,083
awaiting mutilation
at the hands of Welsh witches.

76
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,583
[Northumberland] My liege...

77
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,333
you must excuse my son.

78
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,208
He needs rest.

79
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,291
We come only...

80
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,291
to advocate for your help
in securing Mortimer's release.

81
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,934
All that we've done for you
we have done for the good of England.

82
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,041
But our lands are now
more riven with war than ever before.

83
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,392
The Scots aren't finished.
The Welsh have only just begun.

84
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,458
And for what?

85
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,291
Why do you think this might be, old man?

86
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,916
Who do you imagine
might be to blame for this?

87
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,458
Chickens can't fly.

88
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,916
But I've seen one...

89
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,458
eke enough wing flap to clear a fence.

90
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,875
Then it's free.

91
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,666
But then so too are the foxes.

92
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,875
[sighs]

93
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,875
You are right, young Percy.
I owe you much.

94
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,083
I owe your family still more.

95
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,583
But if the Scottish traitors
you've taken prisoner

96
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,625
are not brought to me
as speedily as they might travel,

97
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,166
I will hang you by your fucking neck.

98
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,416
Has this been heard, young Percy?

99
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,791
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

100
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,416
What a venomous boy.

101
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,708
He'll betray me now. I'm sure of it.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,833
[inhales]

103
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,625
If only he were my son.

104
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,333
[chickens clucking]

105
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,500
[footsteps approaching]

106
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,666
[Falstaff] Hal.

107
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
Mm.

108
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,875
- [knocking]
- [groans]

109
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,375
[Falstaff] Hal?

110
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,250
[door opens]

111
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,208
Hal.

112
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,291
- [exhales]
- [Hal groans]

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,958
- [Falstaff grunts]
- What is it?

114
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
Falstaff has injured hisself.

115
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,833
Yeah. See?

116
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,666
- How did you get inside?
- [Falstaff] The door was ajar.

117
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,625
It was not.

118
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,375
[Falstaff] Yes, it was. It was ajar.

119
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,500
It was not ajar.

120
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,666
Well, how else might we gain entry?

121
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,166
Are you accusing me
of having cut myself a secret key?

122
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,083
Yes.

123
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,333
Falstaff has injured hisself, Hal.
Will you perform the small repairs?

124
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,541
No.

125
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,750
[objects clattering]

126
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,833
[Beale] Oh, no.

127
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
Your Highness.

128
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,833
[Falstaff exhales]

129
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,541
[cries out]

130
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,791
[grunts] There's a fresh coin
in this for you, you know.

131
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,375
I don't want your coin.

132
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,625
I will require your undiminished loyalty
from here till Megiddo.

133
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,458
You have that already.

134
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,791
You're a soft negotiator.

135
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,791
[chuckles]

136
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,666
[yelps] Hey! You're wasting good wine.

137
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,458
- I'm keeping it clean.
- Give it.

138
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh. That looks very hot.

139
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,291
[sizzling]

140
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,250
[Falstaff gulps]

141
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
[Falstaff exhales]

142
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,166
[Falstaff] Do it.

143
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,708
Ow!

144
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,583
- [screaming]
- [sizzling]

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,208
[laughing]

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,958
[grunting]

147
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,750
[people chattering indistinctly]

148
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,833
[church bell sounds]

149
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,375
- [goats bleating]
- [dog barking]

150
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,250
Prince Henry.

151
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,708
Who are you?

152
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,833
We come from the royal court.
We wish to speak with you privately.

153
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,916
For what?

154
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,791
Please, sire. Privately.

155
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, privately, in the middle of Eastcheap?

156
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,458
Should I make a quick up and down
and request a mass covering of ears?

157
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,541
Please, sire.

158
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,750
[grunts]

159
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,875
[goat bleats]

160
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,541
What is this?

161
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,625
Your father, His Majesty King...

162
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,541
Your father,
His Majesty King Henry, is ill.

163
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,708
He requests your presence.

164
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,250
Hmm. I suggest you return
to the palace directly

165
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,625
and tell him his request
was wholly ignored.

166
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,083
I've been instructed
to deliver the request with great urgency.

167
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,125
You might tell him the urgency
was also wholly ignored.

168
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,666
[dog barking]

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,958
- [music playing]
- [people laughing and chattering]

170
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,791

[laughter]

172
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,041
[whistling]

173
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,250
[rhythmic clapping]

174
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,333
[owl hoots]

175
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,166
[door opens]

176
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,250
[keys jangling]

177
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,625
[whispers] My lady.

178
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,458
My lady, it's time to leave.

179
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,916
- Why?
- [shushes]

180
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
The day has begun. See?

181
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,916
- Out there.
- [small exhale]

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,291
It is well underway.

183
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,500
- [groans]
- You might miss it.

184
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
Get up now. It's important that you leave.

185
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,833
- Up. That's the spirit.
- [groans]

186
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:34,916
[exhales]

187
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,458
Right.

188
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,750
Now, lift your arms.

189
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,666
Very good.

190
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,583
[inhales]

191
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,750
[sighs]

192
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,208
[Hal moans]

193
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,583
You must get that door fixed.

194
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,125
What is it?

195
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,041
Visit with your father.

196
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,416
Go away.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,291
If your father is indeed

198
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,750
gravely ill enough
to request your presence,

199
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,333
then you must visit with him.

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,541
It should be better to regret
having done so than it would to have not.

201
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,875
If your father is ill,

202
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,583
no matter your feelings for him,
you must visit with him.

203
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,875
But...

204
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,916
I say this not out of concern
for our king's well-being,

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,875
but more for fear of the drunken soak
to which you'll be likely to succumb

206
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,000
should you fail to heed his call
and he were to die

207
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,333
without you having squared your ledger.

208
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,833
[sighs]

209
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,666
I fear that would be soak enough
to put even me to shame.

210
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,750
[chuckles lightly]

211
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,083
Do it.

212
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,708
If nothing else I ever suggest.

213
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,708
[church bell sounds]

214
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,541
[dog barking]

215
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,000
[archbishop] While I see the strain
your treasury is under,

216
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,208
I cannot help but wonder
if the canker of Lollardy

217
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:17,125
be at the root of this suggestion
that the church be burdened with a tax

218
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,250
to relieve problems
that are not of the church's making.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Your Majesty.

220
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,416
Henry, Prince of Wales.

221
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,125
[King Henry IV] My son.

222
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,208
Come in.

223
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,958
[inhales deeply]

224
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,958
I feel my life nearing its natural end,
and yet, still...

225
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,250
even I must appear
of ruder health than you.

226
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,708
The time has come for us to consider...

227
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,208
the issue of...

228
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,375
my succession.

229
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
[coughs]

230
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,500
You will not be king.

231
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,458
While you are my eldest son,

232
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,666
for reasons that are on display
for all here to see,

233
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,750
smell...

234
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,708
[inhales deeply]

235
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,041
you will not inherit this crown.

236
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,375
Nor have I sought it.

237
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,416
That privilege and responsibility

238
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,166
will instead fall to your brother Thomas.

239
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,208
He is soft, but he is eager.

240
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:06,708
He will lead my army
against the newly treasonous Harry Percy.

241
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:13,666
I will assume that this news comes
as neither surprise nor disappointment.

242
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,083
But it is my duty as king,

243
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
and father...

244
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,791
to say it to you directly.

245
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,791
When do you fight?

246
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,916
I set off tomorrow.

247
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,208
We fight by week's end.

248
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,500
You need not fight.

249
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,250
These feuds need not be yours.

250
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,958
[King Henry IV] I have said...

251
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,708
what you were summonsed to hear.

252
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,291
[inhales deeply]

253
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,458
Leave us now.

254
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,208
[moans]

255
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,208
- Your Highness.
- Stop.

256
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,583
[breathing heavily]

257
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,583
[moans]

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,875
[inhales deeply, moans]

259
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,041
- Your Highness.
- Stop.

260
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,250
[sighs]

261
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,791
[dog barking in the distance]

262
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,958
- [men shouting]
- [horse neighs]

263
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
[man] Move it!

264
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Lord Dorset.

265
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,041
[exhales]

266
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,708
Are your men ready for the day?

267
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,791
They are, sire.

268
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,375
Very good.

269
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,625
Tell me of your preparations.

270
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,208
My lord.

271
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,166
Why are you here?

272
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,083
I will not allow this havoc to transpire.

273
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,833
I've come to see it stopped.

274
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,083
This is my battle.

275
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,708
If I have my way, there will be no battle.

276
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,416
You. Come here.

277
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,208
- [man] My lord.
- You have no place here.

278
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,250
Go to the rebel camp,

279
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,666
deliver the following message
to Percy Hotspur.

280
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,416
Tell him that Prince Henry challenges him
to settle today's score man on man.

281
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
He and I.

282
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,541
We will fight in our armies' places.

283
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,583
Yes, my lord.

284
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,708
Who do you think you are?

285
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,375
I am nobody to you.

286
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,875
I will fight him.

287
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,125
And I will defeat him.

288
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,500
That you surely would, my son.

289
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,916
But it cannot be.

290
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,625
The prince speaks not for his father.

291
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,791
You are eager to fight, my son.

292
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,291
And you will.

293
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,416
And we shall fight alongside you.

294
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,416
We will burn them.

295
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,750
We will burn Henry's reign to the ground.

296
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,000
- [Thomas] You have no place here.
- You do not know war, Thomas.

297
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,583
- I do know war.
- [Hal] You do not.

298
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,500
You've been recruited
to our father's madness,

299
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,750
to wars that need not be fought.

300
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,083
These men are not our enemies.

301
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,875
- Our father has made them thus.
- [Thomas] Why then are you here?

302
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,000
You so disapprove of our cause,

303
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:57,333
and yet, still, you find it necessary
to upstage me.

304
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,708
I do this not to steal your thunder,
brother.

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,333
I do it to save your life.

306
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,706
[man] Pardon me, my lords.

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,333
Our herald is returned
from the rebel camp.

308
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,625
They have refused Prince Henry's offer.

309
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,833
They want battle.

310
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,000
[horse whinnies]

311
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,458
[men shouting]

312
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,916
Whoa, whoa.

313
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,666
[horse grunts]

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,458
- [horse snorts]
- Ha!

315
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,708
[men shouting in the background]

316
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,083
[soft neigh]

317
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,833
- Ha! Go!
- [horse grunts]

318
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:45,916
[man shouts]

319
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:04,958
[soft neigh]

320
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,083
Where is Henry?

321
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,500
I come to fight him in our armies' stead.

322
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,041
No.

323
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,708
His offer was refused.

324
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,875
The offer has been reconsidered.

325
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,958
I said...

326
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,875
[shouts] no!

327
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:20,958
[horse neighs]

328
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,166
Why is the little dog barking?

329
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,625
- Hm?
- [exhales]

330
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,208
[yells] Where be the big dog?

331
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,083
It will be done.

332
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,375
[chuckles softly]

333
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,625
And here I am with the whoring fool.

334
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
This fight need not be had, Percy.

335
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,166
My father will soon be dead.
Your grievances will die with him.

336
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,625
Don't be afraid of our small contest,
young Hal.

337
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,291
I promise to finish it quickly.

338
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,666
Come on.

339
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,666
[man shouts indistinctly]

[exhales]

345
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,208
Your father...

346
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,500
is plague to England.

347
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,916
Come for me, big dog!

348
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,166

[inhales deeply, grunts]

357
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,416
No!

358
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,208
Oh! Oh!

359

00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,166
[both grunting]

369
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,041
[groans]

370
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,333
[shouts]

371
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,708
[grunting]

372
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,708
[panting]

373
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,083
[choking]

374
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,666
[choking stops]

375
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,333
[panting]

376
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,416
[grunts]

377
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,458
[panting]

378
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,041
[continues panting]

379
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,166
[horse neighs]

380
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,125
Hmm. [pants]

381
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,916
[continues panting]

382
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,250
Someday this will be your head,
dropped at the feet of a man

383
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,375
who might otherwise
have been your brother.

384
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,958
Come with me now, Thomas, please.

385
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,625
Walk away from this field.

386
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,541
[panting]

387
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,708
After you have stolen its prized scalp?

388
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:14,291
This is what will be spoken of tomorrow.

389
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,083
[exhales]

390
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,750
[sighs] This field was mine.

391
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,250
It was to mark my dominion.

392
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,458
Instead now...

393
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,666
it marks only this head.

394
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,750
This fucking head!

395
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,250
Move.

396
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,125
[exhales]

397
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,416
[horse neighs]

398
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,291
[dog barks]

399
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,000
- [Hooper] John.
- [groans]

400
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:55,791
John.

401
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,083
Go away.

402
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,791
You might want to see
to your otherwise well-appointed friend.

403
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,958
He seems to have taken a pitiful turn.

404
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,375
[groans]

405
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,000
[owl hoots]

406
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:11,666
[whispers] Beale.

407
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,041
Hal's up-chucked again.

408
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,833
- [dog barking]
- [Falstaff groans]

409
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,416
[sighs]

410
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,708
[groans]

411
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,875
Hello, friend.

412
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,416
Many times have I seen men in your state.

413
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,291
I've been in it many times over myself.

414
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:36,916
[small chuckle]

415
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,666
For all our rejoice of...

416
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,208
courage and valor,

417
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:47,000
nothing stains the soul more indelibly
than killing.

418
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,666
Never have I felt so vile...

419
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,125
than standing victorious on a battlefield.

420
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,291
[grunts]

421
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,750
The thrill of victory fades quickly.

422
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,125
What lingers long after...

423
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,375
is always ugly.

424
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,250
[Falstaff sighs]

425
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,291
Never again, I say.

426
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:20,000
[Hal] Stop talking, old man, please.

427
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,375
Please stop talking.

428
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,750
I will never stop talking, Hal.

429
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,708
[chuckles]

430
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:31,875
Never.

431
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:37,708
Never ever.

432
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,166
- [people chattering indistinctly]
- [baby crying]

433
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,125
[William] Out.

434
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,576
[child exclaims indistinctly]

435
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,625
[William] My lord.

436
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,583
What business?

437
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,791
[William] It is a matter of great urgency.

438
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,083
Mm. You should hurry along then.

439
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,750
Please, my lord.

440
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,375
It is your father.

441
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,416
He's dying.

442
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,375
Hmm, that hook has lost its worm.

443
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,458
[William] Wait outside.

444
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,625
[inhales deeply]

445
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,375
[inhales]

446
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,500
No doubt...

447
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,208
your father has brought...

448
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,708
much trouble to this kingdom,

449
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:39,208
and I fear the chaos
that might erupt in his absence.

450
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,875
England needs a king,

451
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,750
and I suspect those sentiments of yours

452
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,291
that had you resile from him

453
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:52,666
are precisely those
the governance of this land needs.

454
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,000
You must be king.

455
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,708
Why do you say this to me?

456
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:03,708
Speak to Thomas.

457
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,583
Is he not to be your new king?

458
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,041
I'm afraid that is not possible.

459
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,750
Your brother was killed in Wales.

460
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,416
After your defeat of Percy Hotspur,

461
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,125
young Thomas pressed on
to the western fields.

462
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,250
This is where he met his end.

463
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,375
It is said he gave
valiant account of himself.

464
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,916
[exhales softly]

465
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:04,458
[birds chirping]

466
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,291
[dog barks]

467
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,125
[Hal yells] Where is he?!

468
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,625
Where is the monster?!

469
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,416
[clattering]

470
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,208
Where is the monster?

471
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:26,958
Move. Leave him.

472
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,500
The King needs rest.

473
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,666
- Soon he will have it.
- He's dying.

474
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,875
Leave.

475
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,166
[breathing heavily]

476
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,916
[shivering]

477
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,916
You feel this cold?

478
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,750
- Wretch.
- [whimpers]

479
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,750
[groans]

480
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,750
[weakly] Hal.

481
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:19,916
Hal.

482
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:23,708
You must be king, Hal.

483
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,583
Please.

484
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,916
You must be king, Hal.

485
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,666
[groans]

486
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,833
[mumbles indistinctly]

487
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
[cries]

488
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,708
I know not what I have done.

489
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,416
[King Henry IV groans]

490
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,291
You know not what will become of you.

491
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,875
So, I offer you this...

492
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,250
The most blessed reprieve,

493
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,916
the most dreadful misery.

494
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,583
You shall suffer the indignity
of serving me,

495
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,083
the wayward son you so revile.

496
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:59,541
But know now you will be watched over
by an altogether different king.

497
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,833
- [people chattering indistinctly]
- [dog barking]

498
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,125
[footsteps approaching]

499
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,541
[door opens]

500
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:35,583
[coughs]

501
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,333
What is this?

502
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,708
Who are you?

503
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,583
I am I.

504
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,666
Who are you?

505
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,541
[Lord Chamberlain]
What is your purpose here?

506
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,000
[inhales deeply, exhales]

507
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,500
I think you just woke me up from it,
didn't you?

508
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,666
Rise from that bed at once.

509
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
[exhales]

510
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,291
Who are you?

511
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,958
Where is Hal?

512
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:00,666
These lodgings and their contents
are the property of the King of England.

513
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:04,791
You are trespassing
and I order you to vacate at once.

514
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,458
What King of England?

515
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,333
[church bells ringing]

516
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,166
[speaking in Latin]

517
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,750
Amen.

518
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,166
[archbishop] All hail King Henry.

519
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,250
[crowd] King Henry!

520
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,791
King Henry!

521
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,583
King Henry!

522
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,791
[applause]

523
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,750
King Wenceslaus of Bohemia

524
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:24,291
presents this gift
to King Henry of England.

525
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,083
To long and good health.

526
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,625
Beautiful.

527
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,458
I'm sure you all know...

528
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,916
my young sister Philippa
has joined us here today.

529
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,083
Queen of Denmark.

530
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,166
I'm thankful she and her husband,

531
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,375
the good King Eric,
have traveled all this way.

532
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,250
I wish for you take this vase, my dear.

533
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,666
Let its beauty stand for your beauty,
which stands in turn for England's beauty.

534
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,500
I thank you, my lord.

535
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:02,958
[Lord Chamberlain] His Serenity,
the doge of the Republic of Venice,

536
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,291
present this gift in your honor, my liege.

537
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,875
- It says it is a bird from Constantinople.
- [King Henry V] A bird?

538
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,458
A dead one, I should suppose.

539
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,958
[laughter]

540
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,500
If I may, my liege.

541
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:32,500
Unnatural mechanics
from the edge of Christendom.

542
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,166
[crowd gasping and laughing]

543
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,833
[laughs]

544
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:41,458
[applause]

545
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,458
[chuckles]

546
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,208
Hmm.

547
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,541
[King Henry V] A wonder.

548
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,375
This belongs to my cousin, Cambridge.

549
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,125
Of all at this table,

550
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,000
none have I known longer than I have you.

551
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:09,916
Indeed I have known you longer
than I have my own young sister.

552
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,375
We were raised together.
You're like an older brother to me.

553
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,958
So, I think it only fitting
that you should have this magical bird.

554
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:21,083
Let's hope its magic
isn't black and unholy.

555
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,708
[applause and laughter]

556
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,273
[Lord Chamberlain] From the Dauphin,

557
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,916
son of His Majesty, Charles,
King of France.

558
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:46,833
A ball.

559
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,041
There is no accompanying message
from the Dauphin?

560
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,708
No, my liege.

561
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,791
[exhales]

562
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,583
[man coughs]

563
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,708
I shall keep this gift.

564
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,458
This one is sent only for me.

565
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,083
For the boy I once was.

566
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:33,583
The ball is an insult to you
and to your kingdom.

567
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,541
You must respond.

568
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:41,666
Remember where, as prince, I whiled
and how I spent my days?

569
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,458
[William] You spent them
in considered privation.

570
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,208
Drinking, clowning.

571
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,541
So, is there not some truth in this jest?

572
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:54,208
If the Dauphin wants from me a paroxysm,
why give it him?

573
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,791
It would not be a show of foul temper

574
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,166
for you to respond forcefully
to an insult such as that.

575
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,083
It would be a show of strength.

576
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,041
I appreciate your umbrage, William,

577
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,708
but my strength does not lie

578
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,375
in me flapping up and down
at the slightest barb like...

579
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,250
- some unholy mechanical bird.
- Mm.

580
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,208
Make sense of this.
This is what is pressing.

581
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,125
Civil strife has consumed us.

582
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,375
The war drains the purse like little else.

583
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,583
This strife must end.

584
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:32,916
And it will end...

585
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,208
by conciliation.

586
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,541
We shall pardon our adversaries.

587
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,583
And we shall pay Mortimer's ransom
and have him returned from Wales.

588
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,291
I will write these pardons
in mine own hand.

589
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,500
I want it known these sentiments
are so personal to me.

590
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:53,458
We shall let these men know
they were my father's enemies, not mine.

591
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,416
[William] Certainly, my liege.

592
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,208
How does this strategy greet you?

593
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:06,208
Great reforms are best enacted
with regime change.

594
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,916
If this is how you wish to proceed,

595
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,333
then, yes, my liege,

596
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,666
now is the time to do it.

597
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,458
Did you reconcile with our father
before his death?

598
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,375
There was no reconciliation to be had.

599
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,708
He did untold harm to this kingdom.

600
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,458
His death will bring calm with it.

601
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,958
I ask not after the kingdom.

602
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,166
What of you?

603
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,416
I want an end to this unrest.

604
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,208
Look around that table last night.

605
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,500
Look at the faces
of the men seated at it.

606
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,833
I can feel this calm of which you speak.

607
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,416
I do believe they wish you well.

608
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:20,125
But I also see that they have
their own kingdoms behind their eyes.

609
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,750
Do you understand what I say?

610
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,750
I've been away too many years
and I'm now to return to Denmark.

611
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:34,875
But I have, in my time in that court,
been privy to its commissions.

612
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,458
I have seen there, again and again,
that no one ever speaks true,

613
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:40,541
wholly true.

614
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,958
Choose your steps wisely,

615
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:48,791
dear brother.

616
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,961
[archbishop] I speak
to Charles of France's claim

617
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,333
to be the legitimate sovereign ruler
of said lands.

618
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:02,083
It is said that the Salic law
would have no succession

619
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,875
if the French crown fall to a woman.

620
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:08,583
Meaning, no rule
left in the lineage of the female

621
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:11,166
shall, by rights, pass to her issue.

622
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,583
Now, the law Salic,
which is of Frankish land

623
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,083
and tethered to said lands is not...

624
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:23,208
not therefore legally bound
or adherent at all, in fact,

625
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,833
to the lands of France,
but to those of Francia,

626
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:28,875
which, as you know,
lies between the rivers of Elbe and Saale.

627
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,958
I claim here, with proof,
that hence it follows that the law Salic,

628
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:37,416
which has seen French sovereignty stolen
as such from a true lineage...

629
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,416
Thrice, as I can illuminate,
the French have cited the law Salic

630
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,250
- as reason to bar a female succession...
- With reverence.

631
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,125
Yes, my liege?

632
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,541
I'm finding this story
impossible to follow.

633
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:55,500
My liege, I question
the so-called French king's claim

634
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,666
to the throne upon which he sits.

635
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,125
Is that so?

636
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,000
What confuses me now
is why you are telling me this story.

637
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,125
My liege, I simply aim to bolster
your claim to France

638
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,708
should the need to meet her with force
soon arise.

639
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,208
And you believe that need
will indeed soon arise?

640
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,625
I... [chuckles]

641
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,041
My liege...

642
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,541
by way of preparedness,

643
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:21,083
- I believe it always wise...
- Preparedness?

644
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,642
If we are to war with France,
it will not come as a consequence

645
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,500
of an old and impenetrable madrigal.

646
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,333
France was your father's
long-held ambition.

647
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,666
Had he not been bogged in civil feud,

648
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,750
he would most surely
have taken the fight to her.

649
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:39,625
And then...

650
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,250
on to Jerusalem.

651
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,333
Jerusalem?

652
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,708
We're all the way to the Holy Land,
are we?

653
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:50,666
And presumably to sack
the rest of Christendom along the way.

654
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,750
I am not my father, archbishop.

655
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,666
I would have thought this
to be clear by now.

656
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,291
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

657
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,083
[William] We must forgive our archbishop.

658
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,375
He is a far...

659
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:18,458
[exhales] far from gifted orator.

660
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,666
Which is strange,
given I would have thought gifted oratory

661
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,583
to be a requirement of the position.

662
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,291
Why is the archbishop speaking to me
of war with France?

663
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:33,291
What we are witnessing is a stirring,

664
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,875
of which we must be wary.

665
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,208
I applaud...

666
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,458
your restraint.

667
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:46,125
After so many years of strife,

668
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:52,125
you are proving to be more
than your father's son.

669
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,375
You wish to be a king for the people.

670
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,875
Now, we must ensure to that end, however,

671
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:02,250
you do not remain oblivious to the mood

672
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,000
of the people.

673
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,458
And what mood is this?

674
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,333
That France is taunting us.

675
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,208
Do you share this mood?

676
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:15,708
[exhales] Well...

677
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,375
this mood is a fantasy.

678
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,541
But that does not mean
it is not felt true.

679
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,958
- [Beale] Where are you going?
- [Falstaff groans] Disgusting.

680
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,750
- No, we can't be going to Hooper's.
- Yes, we can.

681
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,750
- No, she won't have you.
- Yes, she will.

682
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,666
- [Hooper] Nope!
- Yes.

683
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,625
- [Hooper] No.
- Yes!

684
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:37,666
- You're not welcome here.
- [grunts]

685
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,510
Unless you've come to pay me
what you owe me.

686
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,750
[Falstaff] I have paid you.

687
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,208
You've paid me a snatch of what you owe.

688
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,250
And I presume, too,
from the proceeds of thieving.

689
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,166
[Falstaff] Lies.

690
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,000
By all account, you be not specially good
at thieving neither.

691
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,083
Lies.

692
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,750
How dare you address me so?

693
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,750
Why would you be so churlish

694
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:01,333
with the very man most likely to lift you
from your stinking rat hole?

695
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,166
Oh, maybe you've forgot.

696
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:07,083
My associations now stretch
to the highest reaches of the realm.

697
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,666
Your insolence might as well be directed
to the king himself.

698
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,541
Ponder that now.

699
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,708
[Hooper] Are you speaking of Hal?

700
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,625
[Falstaff] Ah.

701
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,708
Where is he?

702
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,708
- [Falstaff exhales]
- Where is Hal?

703
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,625
Oh.

704
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:20,708
Where's our king?

705
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,833
He be gone weeks and weeks now.
Where is he?

706
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,375
- [clears throat]
- I would say...

707
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,083
- [sighs]
- you be the one that's been forgot.

708
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,500
- Oh.
- I would say that your dalliance

709
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,750
with the upper reaches of the realm

710
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,458
was short-lived

711
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:40,041
in and around his stinking sick bucket.

712
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:45,958
Seems you were little more
than passing keeper of a prince's puke.

713
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,625
- [laughter]
- Shut up.

714
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,875
Ponder that now.

715
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,833
Nell, Sir John is down on his luck.

716
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,916
I am not.

717
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,291
You find someone to pay your way here.

718
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,750
I'll not be paying it for you.

719
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,500
[indistinct chattering]

720
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,083
[man] Head.

721
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:24,916
Head.

722
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:47,541
[in French] Who are you?

723
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:51,958
He seeks asylum in return for his tale.

724
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,416
I do not doubt this can be arranged.

725
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:59,083
[in French] Can it or not?
You are the King, no?

726
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,750
[in French] It can be arranged.

727
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,083
[shaky inhale, exhale]

728
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,125
I have been sent by the King of France
to assassinate you.

729
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,625
Charles himself sent you?

730
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,916
You know this to be certain?

731
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,875
[Gilrich] The order's origin I know, yes.

732
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,291
From the King.

733
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,500
What was the order?

734
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,500
That I should kill the King of England.

735
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,666
How?

736
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,208
[Gilrich] However. Any way. [inhales]

737
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,250
There are many ways to kill a man.

738
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:38,958
It is my talent...

739
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:42,291
killing men
who do not expect to be killed.

740
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:50,791
[in English] At such a time as I endeavor
to foster a fresh and peaceful air

741
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,041
for this kingdom to breathe,

742
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:55,083
it is not in my interest to stir hostility
with another.

743
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,708
This is an act of war.

744
00:49:56,791 --> 00:50:00,541
[William] We share your longing for peace,
my liege,

745
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:04,333
but to ignore
such an audacious act of aggression

746
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,625
will be seen as weakness.

747
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:10,416
This is no game ball. This is an assassin.

748
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,541
Would you consider me weak, Chief Justice?

749
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:14,625
No.

750
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,333
No, I speak more of the kingdom.

751
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,208
What the kingdom sees.

752
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,041
What the kingdom sees. Mm.

753
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:24,916
How, pray, might the kingdom
see the weasel beneath our feet?

754
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,041
If France's animus towards you

755
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,791
runs deep enough for them
to send an assassin,

756
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:34,333
it will be felt in the street,
ours and theirs.

757
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,666
It will be known.

758
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,750
We share your concerns.

759
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:43,500
But peace today needs more than harmony.

760
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,791
It needs strength...

761
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,250
and confidence.

762
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,750
These are qualities
that can originate only in you,

763
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,333
the king.

764
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Our king.

765
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,250
Take down these words...

766
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,333
addressed to King Charles of France.

767
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,250
This assassin you send

768
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:21,291
can be taken as nothing other
than an infant act of war.

769
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,416
If this be your intention,

770
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,375
I say you let it be known plainly

771
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,458
and that you desist
from this timorous slither

772
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,208
in which you presently engage.

773
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:36,458
If it be war you seek,

774
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,750
send the full weight of your army.

775
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,416
For a lone, cowardly assassin

776
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,958
will not topple
this King Henry the Fifth of England

777
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,500
you so underestimate.

778
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,916
Fill this with gunstones
and send it back to France.

779
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:21,541
[horse snorts]

780
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,958
[horse neighs]

781
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,416
[man] Go get the master.

782
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
- [horse neighs]
- [men speak indistinctly]

783
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,166
- [Cambridge] Who is it?
- A Frenchman, sire.

784
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,791
He says he wishes
to speak with you privately.

785
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:47,625
About what?

786
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,500
[man] He wouldn't say, sire.

787
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,500
I asked of him, he wouldn't say.

788
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:53,958
[exhales]

789
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,500
My king has sent me to seek out men
he feels he can trust.

790
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:05,791
He believes there is
discreet discussion to be had.

791
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
What discussion?

792
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:13,000
He believes there is discussion to be had
about your new king of England.

793
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,458
[man speaking indistinctly]

794
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,750
[Cambridge] Only myself and Lord Grey
were met.

795
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,208
We knew not where to turn
about what was spoken to us.

796
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,666
[Grey] We're all of us aware
there's a standing problem.

797
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,791
Our king is of low repute.

798
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:11,833
The French king...

799
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,916
teaches you this?

800
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,708
Is he not thankful

801
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:21,125
for our young Henry's light reaction
to his provocation?

802
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:24,125
The assassin he swears he knows not of.

803
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,416
'Tis a charge he denies.

804
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,750
His plot came to naught.

805
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,208
Of course he would wish
to wipe his hands of it.

806
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:32,291
[Cambridge] Whatever the root,

807
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,791
they have expressed grave concern

808
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,416
regarding our king's mental fortitude.

809
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,875
This envoy is to be trusted, is he not,
Cambridge?

810
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,625
I believe so.

811
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,708
Charles wishes to dethrone our king.

812
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,750
The issue is not France.

813
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,208
This is but a reminder to us
of a more general lunacy.

814
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,541
A boy who but weeks ago
was a drunken boor

815
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:04,375
from the sewers of Eastcheap
now wears England's crown.

816
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:06,791
- Hmm.
- [Grey] What shall become of us?

817
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,892
What shall become of us
when civil misdeeds are forgiven

818
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,833
as if they were but indiscretions?

819
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,083
- When traitors...
- Yes, yes, Lord Grey, your...

820
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,083
[inhales]

821
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:18,083
Your concerns are current.

822
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,625
And they are numerous.

823
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,833
Something must be done.

824
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,625
Something will be done.

825
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,291
Give me quiet.

826
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,583
[grunts]

827
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:41,583
[grunts]

828
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,541
[William] <i>Thus is a king's burden.</i>

829
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,791
A king must make decisions

830
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,708
lesser men are...

831
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:00,000
neither willing nor able to make.

832
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,625
A king is indeed presented with quandaries

833
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,916
lesser men might never encounter

834
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,833
in the course of their whole lives.

835
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,916
[bird caws]

836
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,750
[William grunts]

837
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,000
I wish it were not so.

838
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,791
But problems...

839
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,416
And this is my experience.

840
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,458
Problems that are left unattended...

841
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,541
have a habit of becoming crises.

842
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,916
You have a chance here
to unite the land, Hal.

843
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:48,666
Truly.

844
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,625
You have refreshed its mood with promise.

845
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:57,166
But promise must be fulfilled.

846
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,750
Promise can never be an end in itself.

847
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,291
[men speaking indistinctly]

848
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,625
[men fall silent]

849
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:32,166
As of this day, we're at war with France.

850
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:37,000
Twice I have given her
the benefit of my doubt.

851
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,708
This third affront
will not be left unchecked.

852
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,958
And so, in order to flush
these French rats from their nests,

853
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:50,500
I will have it communicated to them

854
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,583
that we are now at war.

855
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,750
My Lord Grey.

856
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,791
Cambridge.

857
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:17,416
I would ask you to deliver this message
to France, given your...

858
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,333
familiarity with its recipient.

859
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,125
But I believe in the morning
you be otherwise engaged.

860
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,166
Pray how, my liege?

861
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,666
Tomorrow you will have your heads cut off.

862
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,750
No.

863
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:40,916
I have chosen to send you
as an advance party to Hell

864
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:42,958
for the considerable French number

865
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,250
that will soon be needing
to find space there.

866
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,750
You were once my friend.

867
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,916
I am your friend...

868
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,500
cousin.

869
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:03,125
[praying in Latin]

870
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:12,791
[shaky breaths]

871
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,333
[inhales deeply]

872
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,958
[panting]

873
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,458
[Grey breathing shakily]

874
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,916
[shaky breathing and whimpering]

875
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:33,958
[panting]

876
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,500
[indistinct chattering]

877
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
All leave.

878
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:12,666
Now.

879
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,125
[grunts]

880
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,750
You.

881
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,333
Stay.

882
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:26,416
You...

883
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,000
leave.

884
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,666
This is my place.

885
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:32,041
[King Henry V] The hostess can stay.

886
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,666
[horse neighs]

887
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:43,250
I will not jump to your attention.

888
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:47,750
[inhales] And surely not to retread
vile ground

889
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,000
I vowed never to walk again.

890
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,875
I acknowledge my neglect of you, John.

891
01:00:56,458 --> 01:01:00,291
A new chapter of my life has begun
before the last could be properly closed.

892
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,875
These concerns are mine and mine alone.

893
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,666
But the fact that this here
be the first occasion

894
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,250
I've had to sound them aloud
to anyone other than myself

895
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,625
speaks volumes.

896
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:20,458
It speaks to the loneliness
of the position in which I find myself.

897
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,083
To steer our present course,

898
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:26,250
I've been forced
to rely upon the counsel of men

899
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:29,125
whose loyalty I question
every waking moment.

900
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,416
Every waking moment.

901
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,000
I need men around me I can trust.

902
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,416
I'm here because you are my friend.

903
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,333
[chuckles]

904
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:51,916
A king has no friends.

905
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,166
A king has only...

906
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,125
followers...

907
01:01:58,791 --> 01:01:59,791
and foe.

908
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,333
[sighs]

909
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,458
I'm sorry my occasion to visit...

910
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,958
carries with it this doleful weight.

911
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,583
Hal.

912
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,208
I will come with you.

913
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:32,875
I ask only one favor in return.

914
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,125
[inhales]

915
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:38,333
[exhales] Square my account
with that terrible hag...

916
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,333
over there. Would you?

917
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,625
[chuckles lightly]

918
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,625
[King Henry V] <i>We welcome
those newly arrived here.</i>

919
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:53,416
Turn us now in common poise,
with one mind, sharpened.

920
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,208
Together...

921
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,541
we will bring France down.

922
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,625
Together...

923
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,833
we will bring her to her knees.

924
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:06,208
Captains all, to this end,

925
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:09,791
I wish to introduce to you
a new marshal of our campaign.

926
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,166
Sir John Falstaff.

927
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,916
Sir John's experience in battle
should need no recitation.

928
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You know of him.

929
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,416
Some of you have had the honor
of fighting alongside him.

930
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,916
Others have heard tale of his exploits.

931
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,125
But I have tasked Sir John
to join this campaign

932
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:35,083
for one most vital reason alone:

933
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,375
he respects war

934
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:39,500
as only a man who has seen
its most monstrous form can.

935
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,708
He lusts after it not,

936
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,333
but rather regards it
with the grim sobriety

937
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,541
that you and your men
should hope he would.

938
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,083
Welcome,

939
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,750
and thank you...

940
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,583
[inhales] good sirs.

941
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,416
You're all well met.

942
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,041
[Falstaff sighs]

943
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,250
Very good.

944
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,666
[sighs]

945
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,083
[Falstaff sniffs, grunts]

946
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,625
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

947
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,875
[chuckles]

948
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:30,208
Are you ready for what awaits us?

949
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:31,541
[Falstaff inhales deeply]

950
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:34,208
One is never ready for what awaits us.

951
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,916
[dog barks in the distance]

952
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,958
[people chattering indistinctly]

953
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,333
[dog barking]

954
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:51,416
[man] Get!

955
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,625
[clucking]

956
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,416
You believe Sir John there
to be fit and suitable enough

957
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,833
to captain this effort?

958
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,291
John is a good man.

959
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:19,791
[rooster crows]

960
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,583
[horse neighs]

961
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,416
[King Henry V] They meet us at sea
or upon landing.

962
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,458
We shall know soon enough.

963
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,000
You must rest.

964
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:48,500
[horse neighs]

965
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:51,958
[horse neighs]

966
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,083
John.

967
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:08,166
[horse neighs]

968
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,250
Thank you.

969
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,333
What for?

970
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,041
For being here.

971
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:16,541
With me.

972
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,750
Well, it's a small price to pay

973
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,291
to keep that detestable Hooper woman
off me back.

974
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,708
Get some rest too, my liege.

975
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,583
[dramatic music plays]

976
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,250
[man shouting indistinctly]

977
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:05,500
We land quickly!

978
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,208
[man 1] Check every building.

979
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,666
[man 2] No man!

980
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,625
[man 3] Watch.

981
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:43,250
- [man 2] No man here!
- [man 4] Clear!

982
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:45,333
- [man 5] No man here.
- [man 1] No man.

983
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,500
[men shouting indistinctly]

984
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:51,875
[people chattering indistinctly]

985
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:05,791
[man] Go on. Faster.

986
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,416
[man] Light.

987
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,166
Pull!

988
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:37,208
[man speaking indistinctly]

989
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:38,291
Pull!

990
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,125
[Dorset] We must storm that castle.

991
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:32,666
It will be bloody.
We will most surely sacrifice souls.

992
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,875
Thus is the nature of war.
It is bloody and soulless.

993
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:38,184
- [scoffs]
- We have no way of knowing

994
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,250
how well supplied they are
behind those walls.

995
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,791
This siege may take months,

996
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,250
and months, I fear,
we have not at our disposal.

997
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,916
Men in these numbers, fixed here,

998
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,208
will fall to hunger and disease.

999
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:51,375
[men shouting indistinctly]

1000
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:53,000
[horse neighs]

1001
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,375
Sir John.

1002
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:58,500
[inhales deeply]

1003
01:09:58,583 --> 01:09:59,791
[exhales]

1004
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:01,666
War is...

1005
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,000
bloody and soulless.

1006
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:05,958
Yes.

1007
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,208
[horse neighs]

1008
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:14,541
[man shouts indistinctly]

1009
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:23,541
[horse neighs]

1010
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,708
The archbishop has arrived.

1011
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:32,208
[archbishop] Surely you cannot
simply idle here

1012
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,208
until they decide to come out?

1013
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:38,666
That is precisely the definition
of a siege.

1014
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,708
How long might that take?
Surely there's no way of knowing.

1015
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:46,208
Uh, that too,
is a common characteristic of a siege.

1016
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,811
- I will not send my men up that hill.
- But why in heavens not?

1017
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:53,041
I will not sacrifice my men so flagrantly,
nor so speculatively.

1018
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,708
Well, then why do you not
simply go around?

1019
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:02,250
If they insist on hiding in their castle,
why do you not simply go around it?

1020
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:06,375
So well versed in the art of warfare.

1021
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,083
[William] We must take this town,
Archbishop.

1022
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:19,666
We must establish
a garrison foothold here...

1023
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:23,250
for our lines of supply from England.

1024
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:28,416
Do not forget
that I have underwritten this campaign.

1025
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,333
I have interest here.

1026
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:33,916
And I will be heard.

1027
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,416
Not today, Archbishop.

1028
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,166
- [bells ringing]
- [men shouting indistinctly]

1029
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:50,458
[panting]

1030
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:51,916
My liege.

1031
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,625
They have surrendered.

1032
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,291
- Our debate now, it seems, is for nothing.
- Hmm.

1033
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:05,250
As are the archbishop's bleatings.

1034
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:09,791
[goats bleating]

1035
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,875
[in French] The day is yours.

1036
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,166
We ask only
that our women and children be freed.

1037
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,458
Many are hungry and wounded
and becoming sick.

1038
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,958
[in French]
Upon full account of the castle,

1039
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,583
I see no reason to deny your request.

1040
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:34,458
You will have tonight
to oversee this evacuation

1041
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,291
and to corral your men prisoners.

1042
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
[in French] Come.

1043
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,500
[men shouting indistinctly]

1044
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,916
[horse neighs]

1045
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,291
[Dorset] He wishes to slow us.

1046
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,625
Who wishes to slow us?

1047
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:21,125
We have received word
that the Dauphin is en route.

1048
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,875
He wishes conference with His Majesty.

1049
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,625
And we know nothing of his purpose?

1050
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,041
We know only that he desires conference.

1051
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:33,583
I would hope his purpose be
to deliver his father's early surrender.

1052
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:36,416
I strongly advise
we disregard this word of his approach

1053
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,500
and ready our movement.

1054
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,208
We must make advantage of their disarray.

1055
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,166
Sir John, your counsel.

1056
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,041
I've never met the man...

1057
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,208
this French prince.

1058
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:53,333
I can't speak to his motivation.

1059
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:02,666
[men shouting indistinctly]

1060
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,583
[men continue shouting]

1061
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,083
[William] My liege.

1062
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:21,916
He's here.

1063
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:26,208
[inhales deeply]

1064
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:30,083
[mumbling]

1065
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:44,250
[exhales]

1066
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,750
[tapping]

1067
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,375
Your Majesty.

1068
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,333
[exhales]

1069
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,041
Ah! [chuckles]

1070
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:57,416
To...

1071
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,500
your little...

1072
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:00,416
victory.

1073
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,333
Ah.

1074
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:06,916
[sniffs]

1075
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,916
Do you wonder why

1076
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,541
I have come?

1077
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:15,375
Hmm?

1078
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Do you wonder this?

1079
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:20,166
[inhales]

1080
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:25,375
I have not come to offer you surrender

1081
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,375
if that is what you are hoping.

1082
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:30,583
[inhales]

1083
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:35,208
I have come to describe for you

1084
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,625
your end days,

1085
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,041
the screams of your men

1086
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,166
as they die slow.

1087
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:47,000
And so, King of, uh, England,

1088
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,625
you seem so intent
on making France your new home,

1089
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:53,666
so let me help you.

1090
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:58,458
I will drain your body of its blood

1091
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,333
and bury it under a tree.

1092
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:05,750
A little French tree.

1093
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:08,041
Very young,

1094
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:09,833
very small.

1095
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:15,416
Since perchance that is fitting
of your mind for you to come here.

1096
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:18,041
Small.

1097
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:21,916
And maybe your...

1098
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,208
[whistles]

1099
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,583
I mean, no, your balls must be big, no?

1100
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,458
Giant balls.

1101
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,416
[laughs]

1102
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:35,708
Giant balls...

1103
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,791
with a tiny cock.

1104
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:39,291
[laughs]

1105
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:51,333
And the sound
of your wives and children weeping

1106
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,666
shall lull me to sleep at night.

1107
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:57,083
[yawning]

1108
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,625
[continues yawning]

1109
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,125
[inhales]

1110
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,416
[exhales]

1111
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:06,541
[clears throat]

1112
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,625
Have you heard what I said?

1113
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,125
I have.

1114
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:18,666
It was stirring.

1115
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,666
Sir John, please walk with me.

1116
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:26,666
[Falstaff exhales]

1117
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,583
Good night.

1118
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,708
[men continue shouting indistinctly]

1119
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,375
Ready the men to move.

1120
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:45,750
Waste no time.

1121
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,875
[men chattering indistinctly]

1122
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,416
[horse neighs]

1123
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:03,750
[horse neighs]

1124
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,500
[inhales]

1125
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
[exhales]

1126
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:09,791
[indistinct chattering]

1127
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:13,916
[goat bleats]

1128
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,250
[bird hooting]

1129
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,625
[muffled yelling]

1130
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:04,083
[boy] Run!

1131
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:05,875
[panting]

1132
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,333
[grunts]

1133
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:12,875
[panting]

1134
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:14,916
[grunts]

1135
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,750
Hush, hush, hush.

1136
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,083
Hush.

1137
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:19,708
Hush.

1138
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:24,000
Hello, little boy.

1139
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,958
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

1140
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:36,125
I want you to deliver a gift to your king.

1141
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,875
Will you do this for me?

1142
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:41,833
Good boy.

1143
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,208
[panting]

1144
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:54,750
[men chattering indistinctly]

1145
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,291
[horse neighs]

1146
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,375
[man] No!

1147
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:08,750
[men shouting indistinctly]

1148
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,541
Double the guards to 20 yards
through the night.

1149
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,250
Three hours at a watch.

1150
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,403
I want these men fresh and alert.

1151
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,916
Any man caught sleeping
will have his eyes gouged.

1152
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,250
Any caught speaking will lose his tongue.

1153
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:27,333
[grunts]

1154
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,500
[groans]

1155
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:31,208
[grunts, inhales]

1156
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:32,291
[exhales]

1157
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:36,000
And I want all French prisoners
in our train put to death.

1158
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:40,250
Leave their corpses speared on pikes
by the river's edge.

1159
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:41,583
[Falstaff grunts]

1160
01:21:41,666 --> 01:21:43,958
[Falstaff] The first command I'll heed.

1161
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:46,000
The second...

1162
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,708
you'll have to carry out
that mass execution yourself.

1163
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:53,666
What did you say to me?

1164
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,291
You are not that man.

1165
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:58,666
How dare you defy me?

1166
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,625
Show your feeling in here, with me.

1167
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,548
- Don't let it outside this tent.
- How dare you defy me? I am the king.

1168
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,083
And where is
the fearsome old warrior Falstaff

1169
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:08,625
about whom I've heard so much?

1170
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:11,791
You've been mute since we crossed the sea.

1171
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,381
I seem to be serving
as my own chief tactician,

1172
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,166
my own commander, my own counsel.

1173
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,250
[horse neighs]

1174
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:19,541
Where is
the fearsome old warrior Falstaff?!

1175
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:21,916
[dog barking]

1176
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,625
I speak only
when there's something to be said.

1177
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,250
Too often have I seen men of war

1178
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:31,666
invent work for themselves,

1179
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:35,708
work that leads to nothing
but vainglory and slaughtered men.

1180
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:37,708
I'm not that man.

1181
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,625
And this here is the war
that you have chosen to wage.

1182
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,291
I will disembowel you right here
with mine own hand.

1183
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,416
[King Henry V breathing heavily]

1184
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:49,541
[Falstaff groans]

1185
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,416
You are not that man, either.

1186
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,208
[groans]

1187
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:09,250
[man 1] Evening, M'Lord.

1188
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,583
- [Falstaff] Gentlemen.
- [man 2] M'Lord.

1189
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:14,375
[grunts]

1190
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,666
[man praying softly]

1191
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:32,500
[horse neighs]

1192
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,875
Lord Dorset,

1193
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,625
summon your fastest rider.

1194
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,250
My liege.

1195
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:54,208
Dartmouth!

1196
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,791
[horses snorting]

1197
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:00,934
[panting] Sires. What can I do for you?

1198
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:04,041
Tell me what lies over that hill.
Ride fast, return directly.

1199
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:05,416
Hyah!

1200
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:21,791
- [men chattering indistinctly]
- [horses neigh]

1201
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,625
We are both outnumbered
and out-positioned.

1202
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:35,375
They have the downslope in their favor.

1203
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,708
Our need to advance
puts us already at disadvantage.

1204
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:40,851
The longer we wait,
the larger their force will grow,

1205
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:42,375
and with it, our disadvantage.

1206
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:45,708
Your archers, my lord,
are of superior faculty.

1207
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,541
French crossbow is no match
for an English longbow.

1208
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:52,625
We should hobble their number
on first assault by these means alone.

1209
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,250
[horse neighs]

1210
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,291
York's charge in center
faces four lines of mounted knights.

1211
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:00,708
Our archers here
might weaken those by half. But...

1212
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,541
But not eight lines.

1213
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,125
Nine. Ten. More.

1214
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,708
You speak true, my liege.

1215
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,041
The longer we wait,
the greater our disadvantage.

1216
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:14,000
But it is possible our disadvantage
has already grown insurmountable.

1217
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:18,083
A great many men
are already desperately ill

1218
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:19,625
and weak from hunger.

1219
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:20,750
What then, my lord,

1220
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:22,958
do you propose we do?

1221
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,166
I propose we consider turning back,
my liege.

1222
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:29,791
[stammers] I know it will not bring
the outcome we desire,

1223
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,041
but nor will the evisceration of our army.

1224
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:37,791
I'm reticent to speak for others here now,

1225
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:41,166
but I'm certain my fears are shared.

1226
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,791
Who here agrees with Lord Dorset?

1227
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,916
You can win this battle.

1228
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,041
[Dorset] Is that so, Sir John?

1229
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Yes.

1230
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,041
And precisely how is that so, Sir John?

1231
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,333
You fight without horses
and without armor.

1232
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,416
Heavens above,
please spare us from this man.

1233
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:18,333
[Falstaff] Their forward defense
is a front line of mounted men.

1234
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:20,625
Many deep.

1235
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:21,958
Knights all.

1236
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,791
All on horseback,

1237
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,541
all with heavy armor.

1238
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,208
The ground out there...

1239
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:31,458
is a flood bowl,

1240
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:33,833
already half-sodden.

1241
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,791
When it rains tonight, as I know it will,

1242
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,375
that ground will turn into a muddy bog.

1243
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:43,000
And with their horses and their armor,

1244
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,375
they will get stuck,

1245
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,250
they will fall,

1246
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,791
and they will flounder
like upturned beetles.

1247
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:51,958
As shall we.

1248
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,250
Not if we travel light,

1249
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,625
without horses and without armor.

1250
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,708
Speed and mobility will be our advantage.

1251
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,666
[Westmorland] And how, Sir John,

1252
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,625
can you be so sure of rainfall tonight?

1253
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,958
My right knee is aching.

1254
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:13,166
It only does that when rain is near.

1255
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:14,458
[scoffs]

1256
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:16,875
Oh, save us, my liege.
Please put a stop to this drivel.

1257
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:21,541
This would require their armored
front line come meet us in the mud.

1258
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,333
How do you propose we invite that?

1259
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,708
A small forward armored attack of our own.

1260
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:29,666
A false advance.

1261
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:32,458
They will counter.

1262
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:37,625
We save our weight and our muscle
for a nimble assault from the flanks.

1263
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:42,000
They shan't be so easily deceived.
They will not respond to false attack.

1264
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,083
Hmm.

1265
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,500
They will respond.

1266
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:51,458
We move, they will meet us in the mud.

1267
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,791
Our men-at-arms are outnumbered.
This they know.

1268
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,125
They will hope to overwhelm us,

1269
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,416
so they will meet us with full force,

1270
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:02,333
no matter how small our first advance.

1271
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,208
Our great longbows
will rain chaos on them from above.

1272
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:10,333
That chaos will be your favor.

1273
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:14,500
My liege, I implore you, we mustn't...
we mustn't listen to this madness.

1274
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,875
What is the true experience of this man?

1275
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:20,583
He once fought for Richard many years ago.

1276
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:22,666
Since then, he has done nothing...

1277
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,666
other than ride with the companies,

1278
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,083
robbing and tormenting.

1279
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:33,208
I never robbed anyone
who didn't deserve to be robbed.

1280
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,208
If it rains tonight,

1281
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,000
we fight tomorrow.

01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,208
merely to prove to me your worth,

1285
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:15,750
please say so now.

All plans are speculative.

1288
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:27,541
And as I say,
I only speak them when I feel them true.

1289
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:30,041
This one I feel in my bones.

1290

Here we are on the eve of this fight,
and I am...

01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,125
I am scared to wonder,

1295
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:49,916

1296
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:54,625
why we are here.

1297
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,833
You best discover the answer for that.

1298
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,666
The men out there deserve it.

1299
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,958
They've given their lives to you.

1300
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:11,750
I cannot say what forces
have conspired to bring you here,

1301
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,375
but these men need you,

1302
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,208
just as you need them.

1303
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,125
These men deserve your confidence.

at least then tell them a magnificent lie.

1307

This wind whips from the north.

1323

The rain was sent from England.

1324
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:28,625
Why are you being fitted with plate?
We were to fight without armor.

1325
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:31,375
We need a front line to draw them in.

1326
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,041
It cannot be you.

1327
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:36,916
[Falstaff] The idea was mine.

1328
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:41,708
Some man must lead the first push
to sell it well.

1329
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:44,583
My men have been assembled.

1330
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:47,375
And I cannot, in good conscience,

1331
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:50,083
send them out there
to realize my speculative drivel

1332
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,125
without getting muddy alongside them,
can I?

1333
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,125
I will fight with you.

1334
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:58,166
[inhales] It's noble,

1335
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,666
but you know that cannot be.

1336
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:03,875
This is what I was built for.

1337
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:06,916
I die here or...

1338
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,041
I die over a bottle in Eastcheap.

1339
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:13,458
And I think this makes
for a much better story.

1340
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,125
And you have things still to do.

1341
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:21,583
You will join this fight.

1342
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:26,958
But promise me you don't join too early.

1343
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:29,875
It doesn't matter what you see out there.

1344
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,833
We must first draw them all in.
All of them.

1345
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:37,458
Promise me that, Hal.

1346
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,875

I humbly thank you for receiving me,

01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:30,458
[in English] Please.

1353
01:35:31,416 --> 01:35:32,500
Please speak English.

1354
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,041
I enjoy to speak English.

1355
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,291
It is simple...

1356
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
and ugly.

1357
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,666
I have been waiting all morning,

1358
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:48,041
all the night...

1359
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:49,541
for your surrender.

1360
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:54,333
It might have saved a great unease

1361
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:55,791
had it come sooner.

1362
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:58,416
I know you do not speak for your father.

1363

I do speak for my father.

1364
01:36:00,458 --> 01:36:03,750
I know you do not speak for your father,
so I come to you now directly.

1365
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:05,291
I have not come to surrender.

1366
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:09,708
Too much Christian blood
will be spilled on this field today.

1367
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:11,125
So, I propose this:

1368
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:14,666
You and I fight, one man on one man.

1369
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,833
We fight in our armies' stead.

1370
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:22,166
If I lose, my men will leave this place
forthwith and forever.

1371
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:23,666
You will have my head.

1372

If I win,

1373
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:29,166

upon your father's death.

on the brim of a battlefield.

[in French] Your Majesty...

Henry, King of England.

1558
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:18,875
Hmm.

1559
01:54:23,166 --> 01:54:25,041
[in English] Your Majesty...

1560
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:27,375
Come sit here with me.

1561
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:32,875
Please.

1562
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:47,750
I like to have the sun on my skin,
but not too much.

1563
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,958
Too much is very dangerous.

1564
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:10,208
This conversation we are about to have...

1565
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:13,375
has been had many times before,

1566
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:17,666
and will be had many times again
for centuries to come

1567
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:22,583
between men of vanity
and men of good reason.

1568
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:26,333
I would hope that you and I

1569
01:55:26,416 --> 01:55:28,000
are men of good reason.

1570
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:35,541
I have, of course, traveled here

1571
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:38,250
to offer you my surrender.

1572
01:55:41,416 --> 01:55:43,500
Do you ask anything of me in return?

1573
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:46,708
No.

1574
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,750
I do, however,

1575
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,458
have for you a proposition.

1576
01:56:00,375 --> 01:56:03,625
You take the hand of my daughter,

1577
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:04,708
Catherine,

1578
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:07,666
in marriage.

1579
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:12,625
It is most uncanny...

1580
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:16,708
that the great movements of history

1581
01:56:16,791 --> 01:56:21,333
so frequently find their origins
in the minutia of family.

1582
01:56:24,375 --> 01:56:27,166
That in ways I dare not unsettle here,

1583
01:56:28,666 --> 01:56:30,916
my relationship with my son

1584
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,083
and yours...

1585
01:56:32,833 --> 01:56:33,916
with your father.

1586
01:56:35,166 --> 01:56:38,625
These are the things
that have led us here today.

1587
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:43,250
We are leaders of lands

1588
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:45,041
and peoples,

1589
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,291
and yet...

1590
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,375
it is family that moves us.

1591
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:53,666
Family...

1592
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,541
consumes us.

01:57:24,875 --> 01:57:26,916

1595
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:39,916
My condolences to you...

1596
01:57:40,875 --> 01:57:43,500
for the loss of your friend, Sir John.

1597
01:57:46,208 --> 01:57:49,041
I know you must feel this loss deeply.

1598
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,125
Thank you, William.

1599
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,208
Your loyalty to me has been comforting.

1600
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:12,458
[grunts]

1601
01:58:19,416 --> 01:58:22,666
You have proven yourself
to be a most worthy king.

1602
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:28,833
I would say you have proven yourself

1603
01:58:28,916 --> 01:58:31,416
to be one of England's great kings.

1604
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:47,916
[Lord Chamberlain] Your Majesty,
the crowd has gathered.

1605
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,333
[crowd shouting and cheering]

1606
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:50,458
So I hear.

[footsteps approach]

1612
01:59:16,833 --> 01:59:17,833
[in French] Leave us.

1613
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:28,541
[crowd cheering and shouting]

1614
01:59:30,958 --> 01:59:32,916
Please sit, Your Majesty.

1615

[coughs]

1616
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,541
[in French] You are beautiful.

1617
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:45,500
<i>Merci.</i>

1618
01:59:45,583 --> 01:59:47,583
[church bells sound]

1619
01:59:47,666 --> 01:59:49,166
I will no longer speak French.

1620
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:51,041
We must speak English.

1621
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:53,041
I cannot speak English.

1622
01:59:53,125 --> 01:59:54,125
You will learn.

1623
01:59:55,625 --> 01:59:57,083
I wonder, then,

1624
01:59:57,708 --> 02:00:00,333
how our union might proceed
in the meantime.

1625
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:06,875
[in English] There is much I wonder
about a great many things.

1626
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:10,541
[in English] Indeed there must be for you

1627
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:13,416
to contemplate marriage
to a woman about whom...

1628
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,833
you know so little.

1629
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:17,125
Hmm.

1630
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,833
I will not submit to you.

1631
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:25,750
You must earn my respect.

1632
02:00:28,833 --> 02:00:30,083
I understand that.

1633
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,750
Do you?

1634
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:34,208
I do.

1635
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:38,208
Do you feel a sense of achievement?

1636
02:00:39,291 --> 02:00:40,291
[exhales]

1637
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:42,416
In what regard?

1638
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,625
In any regard.

1639
02:00:43,875 --> 02:00:46,291
I have achieved that
which my father never could.

1640
02:00:46,875 --> 02:00:49,041
I have united this kingdom
in common cause.

1641
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:50,541
Hmm.

1642
02:00:52,541 --> 02:00:55,291
You have achieved momentary respite.

1643
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:58,416
A unity forged under false pretense

1644
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,708
will never be a unity that prevails.

1645
02:01:01,041 --> 02:01:04,291
How, pray, have my endeavors
been forged falsely?

1646
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:09,166
Why did you bring war to France?

1647
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,208
Your father came on spoiling.

1648
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:14,166
How so? How was he spoiling?

1649
02:01:15,416 --> 02:01:16,791
He sent an assassin.

1650
02:01:17,375 --> 02:01:18,875
There was no assassin.

1651
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:21,041
There was no plot to kill you.

1652
02:01:24,875 --> 02:01:25,875
How might you know?

1653
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:30,208
Because I was with my father
when he received word of your charge.

1654
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:33,500
I know him well enough
to know his reaction to be genuine.

1655
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:37,416
How was his reaction?

1656
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:39,541
He laughed.

1657
02:01:40,833 --> 02:01:43,208
He laughed very much.
He said you must be drunk.

1658
02:01:44,208 --> 02:01:45,750
Your father is a madman.

1659
02:01:46,541 --> 02:01:48,541
He may be mad, but he is true.

1660
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:52,291
His madness makes him true.
He says only what he believes.

1661
02:01:53,083 --> 02:01:54,666
That is why he is loved.

1662
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:58,875
The assassin then
was sent by your brother.

1663
02:01:58,958 --> 02:01:59,833
- My brother?
- Mm-hmm.

1664
02:01:59,916 --> 02:02:02,083
My brother was too stupid
to conjure such a plan.

1665
02:02:04,125 --> 02:02:05,500
What was your true reason?

1666
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,875
Did you know of the ball he sent?

1667
02:02:10,166 --> 02:02:11,750
The ball he sent to me?

1668
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:16,625
A ball?

1669
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:20,958
He sent to you...

1670
02:02:21,958 --> 02:02:24,333
- a ball?
- Why should you question my intent?

1671
02:02:25,291 --> 02:02:28,666
Your father's rule is illegitimate.
He has no right claim to his throne.

1672
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,750
All monarchy is illegitimate.

1673
02:02:31,625 --> 02:02:33,791
You yourself are the son of a usurper.

1674
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,250
It would seem that you have no explanation
for what you have done.

1675
02:02:48,041 --> 02:02:51,125
You have shed the blood
of so many Christian souls, and yet...

1676
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,875
before me now, all I see is a...

1677
02:02:54,958 --> 02:02:55,958
[inhales]

1678
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,458
young and vain and foolish man

1679
02:02:58,541 --> 02:03:00,000
so easily riled.

1680
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,875
So easily beguiled.

1681
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,500
I must leave you now.

1682
02:03:23,375 --> 02:03:25,708
[footsteps depart]

1683
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:27,375
[crowd cheering and shouting]

1684
02:03:28,625 --> 02:03:29,666
[William] Gentle.

1685
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:40,500
Ah.

1686
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:48,041
We must be sure to revel in this day,
my friend.

1687
02:03:49,541 --> 02:03:53,208
A crowd has gathered
in honor of our victory.

1688
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:57,500
These are the rare moments
for which a king truly lives,

1689
02:03:57,583 --> 02:03:58,916
I would imagine.

1690
02:04:01,875 --> 02:04:03,833
In all my preoccupation, I have...

1691
02:04:04,416 --> 02:04:06,541
neglected to ask after your family.

1692
02:04:07,083 --> 02:04:08,083
Oh.

1693
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:11,416
Your preoccupations are hardly trifling.

1694
02:04:12,375 --> 02:04:13,541
You have two sons.

1695
02:04:14,166 --> 02:04:15,166
I do.

1696
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,583
[King Henry V] And...

1697
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:20,916
your wife minds your estate
in your absence.

1698
02:04:21,666 --> 02:04:22,666
[William] She does.

1699
02:04:26,666 --> 02:04:27,708
Yours is sheep.

1700
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:29,125
[chuckles]

1701
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,083
You're a man of wool.

1702
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,666
As was my father before me.

1703
02:04:35,166 --> 02:04:36,375
How many head?

1704
02:04:37,375 --> 02:04:41,666
At last count, some 4,000.
Mostly Dorset Horns.

1705
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:46,833
How much land have you?

1706
02:04:47,916 --> 02:04:48,916
Oh.

1707
02:04:49,958 --> 02:04:51,791
To be true, I'm not...

1708
02:04:52,875 --> 02:04:54,333
wholly certain, but...

1709
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:56,125
but many...

1710
02:04:56,166 --> 02:04:58,750
many hundreds
of beautiful, beautiful acres.

1711
02:05:07,458 --> 02:05:09,958
What lands in France have you now annexed?

1712
02:05:12,583 --> 02:05:13,583
[William] Stop.

1713
02:05:16,333 --> 02:05:17,166
Hmm?

1714
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,416
Now that France is ours,
how much of her land is now yours?

1715
02:05:23,166 --> 02:05:24,166
Oh, well...

1716
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,250
That has yet to be determined. [chuckles]

1717
02:05:27,791 --> 02:05:29,583
Your conquest is so recent.

1718
02:05:31,041 --> 02:05:33,833
- Why do you ask this question...
- Stay up there.

1719
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,458
- Hmm?
- Stay up there.

1720
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,625
[grunts] Oh.

1721
02:05:46,458 --> 02:05:47,458
[exhales]

1722
02:05:55,958 --> 02:05:57,791
How did my assassin come to you?

1723
02:06:02,333 --> 02:06:04,041
I fail to remember the moment.

1724
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,250
Remedy this failure.

1725
02:06:10,375 --> 02:06:12,958
So much has happened
in the intervening months.

1726
02:06:13,041 --> 02:06:14,500
An event as pivotal as this one

1727
02:06:14,583 --> 02:06:17,916
should be amply equipped
to penetrate the fog of time elapsed.

1728
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,500
No?

1729
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:21,416
Of course.

1730
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:22,500
[inhales]

1731
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:24,583
Let me recall.

1732
02:06:29,625 --> 02:06:30,958
Was it in the street?

1733
02:06:33,166 --> 02:06:34,833
Did he come to you in the street?

1734
02:06:35,958 --> 02:06:37,750
Yes. Yes, it was in the street.

1735
02:06:37,833 --> 02:06:39,750
He approached me... [inhales]

1736
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:41,541
most unusually.

1737
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:45,583
My liege, please, tell me
the cause of this concern.

1738
02:06:45,666 --> 02:06:46,750
Stay up there.

1739
02:06:50,041 --> 02:06:51,250
Stay up there.

1740
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:03,958
Did he know your name?

1741
02:07:05,708 --> 02:07:06,833
I don't believe he did.

1742
02:07:06,916 --> 02:07:09,541
How, then, did he know
who you were to approach?

1743
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,500
Ah.

1744
02:07:17,666 --> 02:07:19,250
The memory is returning.

1745
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:22,750
[exhales]

1746
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:25,041
He surrendered himself to palace guards

1747
02:07:25,125 --> 02:07:27,041
and the matter
was brought to my attention.

1748
02:07:27,125 --> 02:07:28,666
I was taken to him.

1749
02:07:28,916 --> 02:07:30,556
So, he did not come to you in the street.

1750
02:07:30,583 --> 02:07:33,541
No. No, it was not in the street.
Forgive me.

1751
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:35,583
I was summoned to his cell.

1752
02:07:38,125 --> 02:07:39,125
[exhales]

1753
02:07:43,041 --> 02:07:45,416
Has a problem arisen...

1754
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:47,750
Hal?

1755
02:07:48,083 --> 02:07:49,083
Yes.

1756
02:07:49,458 --> 02:07:50,583
A problem has arisen.

1757
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:54,208
And it wobbles before me now
on its silly little stool

1758
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:56,791
- at mine own elevation.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.

1759
02:07:56,875 --> 02:08:00,000
- Please, please, stop this charade.
- Sincerely, I do not understand.

1760
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:02,125
[yells] Stop the fucking charade!

1761
02:08:02,208 --> 02:08:03,041
Stop it!

1762
02:08:03,125 --> 02:08:05,708
[yells] I have given you
what you wanted, boy!

1763
02:08:07,083 --> 02:08:08,250
Have I not?!

1764
02:08:09,583 --> 02:08:11,583
[panting]

1765
02:08:13,916 --> 02:08:14,916
Mm.

1766
02:08:16,583 --> 02:08:17,583
Mm.

1767
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:21,750
[grunts]

1768
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:24,291
[exhales]

1769
02:08:24,458 --> 02:08:25,875
[shaky breath]

1770
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:31,458
You wanted peace.

1771
02:08:31,916 --> 02:08:32,916
[yells] Did you not?!

1772
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:41,125
This is how peace is forged.

1773
02:08:42,958 --> 02:08:45,583
It is forged in victory.

1774
02:08:47,416 --> 02:08:48,416
Listen.

1775
02:08:49,291 --> 02:08:50,333
[pants]

1776
02:08:51,541 --> 02:08:52,666
[inhales deeply]

1777
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:54,541
[crowd shouting and cheering]

1778
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:55,541
[breathes heavily]

1779
02:08:55,625 --> 02:08:57,583
That is the sound of peace.

1780
02:08:58,125 --> 02:09:00,125
[crowd continues cheering and shouting]

1781
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:02,208
[William breathing heavily]

1782
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:04,416
That is the sound of your peace.

1783
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:09,958
[inhales deeply]

1784
02:09:11,833 --> 02:09:13,458
[William breathes shakily]

1785
02:09:14,208 --> 02:09:17,250
That is the sound of your greatness.

1786
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:20,500
[crowd cheering]

1787
02:09:20,583 --> 02:09:21,583
Hmm?

1788
02:09:23,458 --> 02:09:25,333
[William breathing heavily]

1789
02:09:29,625 --> 02:09:30,625
[grunts]

1790
02:09:31,291 --> 02:09:32,875
[groans]

[crowd continues cheering and shouting]

1793
02:09:57,875 --> 02:09:59,208
[indistinct chattering]

1794
02:09:59,666 --> 02:10:01,041
- My liege.
- My liege.

1795
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,541
My liege.

1796
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,666
I ask nothing of you...

1797
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,333
only that you will always
speak to me clear and true.

1798
02:10:28,666 --> 02:10:29,666
Always.

1799
02:10:33,041 --> 02:10:34,916
Will you promise me only that?

1800
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,875
[man shouts] Long live the King!

1801
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:39,250
- [crowd] Long live the King!
- I will.

1802
02:10:40,583 --> 02:10:41,875
Long live the King!

1803
02:10:41,958 --> 02:10:43,583
[crowd cheering and shouting]

1804
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:45,750
[man] Long live the King!

1805
02:10:45,833 --> 02:10:47,958
[crowd] Long live the King!

1806
02:10:49,916 --> 02:10:51,583
[man] King Henry!

1807
02:10:51,666 --> 02:10:53,791
[crowd] King Henry!

1808
02:10:53,875 --> 02:10:55,458
King Henry!

1809
02:10:56,125 --> 02:10:57,625
King Henry!

1810
02:10:58,416 --> 02:10:59,833
King Henry!

1811
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:02,000
King Henry!

1812
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:04,250
King Henry!

1813
02:11:04,958 --> 02:11:06,458
King Henry!

1814
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:08,750
King Henry!
