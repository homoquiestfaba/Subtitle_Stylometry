1
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:55,519
You're fast.

2
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:00,107
I could make lots of money off of you.

3
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,486
Where’s your friends ?

10
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,937

11
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:41,982
I lost again.

12
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:47,779
If Harry is still alive I am gonna kill him.

13
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,659
I'll tell you something, never ever trust a gambler.

14
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:00,125
Bet's a bet.

15
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:18,597
What was he thinking ?

16
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:20,849
Were they trying to shoot it or fuck it.

17
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:22,893
why you think he did it ?

18
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,395
16.

19
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:26,855
No he couldn't done it for less than 20.

20
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:27,856
18 the most.

21
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:28,857
Who the hell cares ?

22
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:31,526
Let's get out of here, it's gonna 120°.

23
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:35,697
Can I put that  one over for 10.

24
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:39,034
$20.

25
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:39,701
50$

26
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,703
Make it fall to the left.

27
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:42,829
$50 it is.

28
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:44,706
I want a piece of that.

29
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:47,000
This guy is gonna rot pretty quick you guys.

30
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,126
He doesn't mind.

31
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,856
I'll pay you on Friday.

32
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:10,857
Friday then, Mr. Henshaw.

33
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:13,026
Don't make me come get you.

34
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,027
And you sir ?

35
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:16,613
I put it on the one down there.

36
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:45,267
you cocksucker son of bitch, You almost electrocuted me.

37
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,019
Can't take anymore of your crap.

38
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:52,816
He put baby oil on a wet floor

39
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:57,195
and I hit it and my ass must have slipped for like 10 15 fucking feet.

40
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,160
Are you through in here?

41
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,202
Hey, lieutenant, how you doing?

42
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,293
Get back to work.

43
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:21,762
I am telling you Loony Tunes are not written for kids.

44
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,473
I learned a word like 'pole trune'.

45
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,600
- What?
- Pole trune, it means face coward.

46
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,226
'Craven', here's another one.

47
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:29,519
The fuck is a craven'?

48
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,520
'Craven' also means coward

49
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,731
You learn these words watching cartoons ?

50
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:33,732
I learned them from watching cartoons.

51
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:38,945
Porky Calls Sylvester the cat a shameless p..p...p pole trune.

52
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:40,864
It's good, You know any others ?

53
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,580
All right, here's another one: from little red riding hood,

54
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,540
The wolf shows up and tells granny to scram.

55
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,169
Granny puts her hands on her hips and says , "For lands sakes wolfie ain't you gonna eat me?"

56
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,170
No fucking way

57
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,297
In the cartoons.

58
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:58,298
I fucking love that!

59
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:00,133
What's in the bag ?

60
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,134
Nothing.

61
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,302
what do you mean nothing, what's in there ?

62
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:04,304
I got some pie for Katie.

63
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:09,893
St least I am getting some.

64
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,562
Not going to cuff my carrot and go to bed.

65
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,606
It makes a man go to sleep.

66
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:26,785
That's not funny.

67
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,163
I love six graders.

68
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:32,457
Hi, smiley.

69
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,000
Where's your tooth where did it go ?

70
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,001
I lost it.

71
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:37,671
An other one is coming in ?

72
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,048
It's gonna be big huh?

73
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:41,049
What's your name ?

74
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,050
Betsy.

75
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,552
Betsy, that's a pretty name.

76
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:45,679
- Come on sweety, let's go.
- take care.

77
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:48,056
Betsy's Revenge.

78
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,100
Come on, 8 to 1.

79
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:53,687
Fred, give me a quarter.

80
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:54,688
Finish the day without betting

81
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,440
-Give me the money.
-Give him the quarter for Christ sake man.

82
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,777
Do it do it!

83
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:05,532
Doesn’t matter, He can't bet on horses on this system.

84
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,533
No shit.

85
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,870
Yeah it's ridiculous, what is worse the salt of the half gallon of Tabasco they put in there ?

86
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,539
You're an amazing chef.

87
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,791
Seymore, hey it's Harry.

88
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:17,961
What do you mean fuck me?

89
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,050
Yes, I know how much I owe Chicago.

90
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,138
Yes, listen to me, I want Betsy's Revenge, in the 4th at La Forth Paradise, ok?

91
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,141
No, I can't.

92
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:37,397
No, no more  Harvey, every time I place a bet with those guys I lose.

93
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:39,941
I'm telling you, this is a sure thing

94
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:45,614
No, not you and  your scientific system.

95
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:46,615
I'm betting on a little girl smile, Seymore.

96
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:51,995
All right, beautiful. I'll see you later.

97
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:52,996
What's up?

98
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:53,997
We got a call.

99
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,832
-You got a call?
-Yeah, then we gotta go.

100
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,554
What's going on ?

101
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:12,891
There's a woman in there, threatened to kill her husband.

102
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:13,934
She's got a gun to his head.

103
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:19,398
I gave you the last quarter.

104
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,274
Give me a quarter.

105
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:31,660
All right let me have your gun.

106
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:42,462
What is her name?

107
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:43,463
A Maria something.

108
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,800
Maria ?

109
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,928
Someone covered the back exists ? - There is no back exists

110
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:51,763
Maria, I am a police officer

111
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,016
Get the fuck away!

112
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:58,437
Just relax ok, relax?

113
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,230
One more step and I’ll kill him.

114
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,192
I’m gonna put my arm down, all right.

115
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:08,530
My name is Harry,
I just wanna find out what's going on.

116
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:13,118
-He's a pig.
- We're all pigs, Maria.

117
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,330
Do you mind if I have a cigarette?

118
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,920
I mean it, I’m gonna kill this asshole.

119
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,130
Guys, please.

120
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:31,511
Why don't you tell me, what's going on with the gun?

121
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:32,512
What's with the gun?

122
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:35,682
I'll tell you what's with the gun.

123
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:42,022
I come home from work, and this bastard is in bed with my daughter.

124
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:43,023
Told you, she...

125
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:45,025
Shut the fuck up!

126
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:48,570
- She's 12 years old.

127
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:53,450
Some stepfather huh!

128
00:11:56,828 --> 00:12:00,749
You know what Maria,
shoot him!

129
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,543
Hey, are you crazy !

130
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:04,920
Shut the fuck up!

131
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,544
Ok, good. Let's start with your options.

132
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:51,800
if you shoot him, right away you're gonna have sympathy on your side

133
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,636
Media is gonna be all over this, like horseshit on a race track

134
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:56,805
Probably gonna get off.
- Really ?

135
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,976
I should kill this asshole.

136
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:02,519
You're right Maria, you should.

137
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,520
No question about it.

138
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,939
What about your daughter?

139
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:08,650
It seems to me she needs you.

140
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,362
So why don't you just give me your gun?

141
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:42,100
Let go of me!

142
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,611
Are you all right?

143
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,464
Did you ever see King Kong?

144
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:15,550
I've seen it a hundred times at least.

145
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,260
-Really?
-Yeah.

146
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,097
I haven't seen it since I was a kid, it was on last night

147
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,308
Let me ask you a question

148
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,521
Natives on this island. They build this huge fucking wall, designed to keep out King Kong

149
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,438
Wouldn't you?

150
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:31,733
The scene where King Kong attacks the village to get that screaming woman.

151
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:35,737
He attacks the village and he forces his way through these 2 giant doors.

152
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:39,699
That's the scene they use for the poster
Kong breaking through the giant doors.

153
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:42,661
They built a wall, to keep out this giant gorilla .

154
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:46,123
Why the fuck did they put two giant doors in it big enough for Kong to fit through ?

155
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,583
what the fuck were they thinking about?

156
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,503
Plus, King Kong can climb the Empire State Building

157
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:52,796
but he can't climb this wall

158
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:55,632
Did they coat it with KY jelly or something, it doesn’t make sense.

159
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,970
Doesn't make sense

160
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:24,786
Take him downtown!

161
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,084
Are you all right?

162
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,213
Come here.
What's your name, I’m a cop it's okay?

163
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:36,548
What's your name?

164
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:37,549
Veronica.

165
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:38,842
For how long are you, veronica?

166
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:42,554
I just came here to get some penicillin.

167
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:45,515
Are you sure you're gonna be ok?

168
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:49,102
You know you're the first person that asked me this question today.

169
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,133
Hey, Sid!

170
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:23,303
What did you do to your hand?

171
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,721
It's okay really.

172
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:26,098
What did you do, what happened?

173
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,101
I am a diabetic Harry...

174
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:32,437
And Ester, she got blood pressure.

175
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,942
You got no idea what my medication can do.

176
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,652
Sid, get to the point!

177
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,448
I needed money, Harry.

178
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,367
Who did you borrow from?

179
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,744
Louie.

180
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:49,037
Louie ?

181
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:52,082
Next time you need money, you come to see me.

182
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:56,545
Come on Harry, you're my tenant, I can't borrow money from you.

183
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:57,754
Get him to see a doctor.

184
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:03,510
He owes almost $2,000,
What am I gonna do?

185
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,517
You're going in there ?

186
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,518
I'll be right back.

187
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,846
Harry, Harry, Harry,
Is it business or pleasure?

188
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:49,681
Sid canned his tab.

189
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:52,893
Ok? don't lend him money anymore.

190
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:55,228
Sure, it’s recalcitrant anyway.

191
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,229
Deal.

192
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:57,647
Who broke his hand?

193
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,649
Well suppose I tell you it's your buddy.

194
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,151
Mike Henshaw

195
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,988
What mike does on his off time, I don't care about.

196
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,866
I also know that mike would never hurt Sid.

197
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,243
Look I don't wanna start anything.
you pick a girl.

198
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,329
Any girl. it's on me.

199
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,330
Don't worry about it.

200
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,540
I'd hate you to run me in

201
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,461
And then I would have to elaborate with phoenix police about

202
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,671
my relationship with detective Henshaw.

203
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,638
Who broke my landlords hand?

204
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:31,640
Jesus Christ, this is what you're getting all wind up about?

205
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,641
Yes.

206
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,017
-Who the fuck cares ?
-I care, Mike!

207
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:37,771
I didn't go after Louie just because of you.
Tell me, who broke Sid’s hand?

208
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:39,940
Look I’ll talk to Louie.

209
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,651
Mike, I wanna know this guy's name.

210
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,070
Tell me!

211
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,906
Harry I make really good money working for Louie.

212
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:50,409
Do you know what position you're putting me in?

213
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,119
Mike, I’m not gonna discuss the fact that you're a fucking cop.

214
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,997
We've known each other since 16 years, I am your fucking friend.

215
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:57,999
Don't fuck a friend.

216
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,793
Don't fuck a friend...

217
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:00,794
Don't fuck a friend?

218
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,796
what are you a parrot?
Don't fuck a friend.

219
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:14,141
Come on. who was it?

220
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:16,309
Chubby.

221
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,436
Chubby?

222
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:20,605
Good. Chubby...

223
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:24,109
You know what, wait!

224
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:27,904
Well you don't wanna fuck a friend,
give me that $50.

225
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,824
-For what?
-For the cactus.

226
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,409
-I wipe $50 on my ass.
-Whatever?

227
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:33,910
Give me my $50.

228
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:36,538
Don't ever welch on a bet.

229
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:37,956
Don't welch on a bet.

230
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,794
Don't welch.

231
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:45,130
You happy?

232
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,099
I'll be right back.

233
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,108
Chubby!

234
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:07,110
What the hell you want?

235
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,945
Don't ever bother to see Sid again.

236
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:10,447
Don't ever touch him!

237
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,950
Fuck you. wait till you own some money and see what happens.

238
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,953
It's this simple.

239
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:20,374
Enough with the paper work. You touch him again, I'm gonna kill you!

240
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:22,751
And don't you fucking sass me ever!

241
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:24,503
You understand me?

242
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:26,380
You're fucking with the wrong guy, Chubby!

243
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:29,383
Eat your fucking hotdog!

244
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:51,780
Hello!

245
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,573
Hey, Seymour, what's up?!

246
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:57,369
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:20:57,786 --> 00:20:58,370
What are the stakes?

248
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,541
What? $100,000?
Definitely, I'm gonna be there in 20 minutes.

249
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,502
20 minutes, yes.
Lock it up, lock it up.

250
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,505
I got to go!

251
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:16,888
You got to be kidding me?

252
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:18,932
No, I got to go.

253
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,352
I'll be back in a few hours.

254
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:28,191
Harry, don't tell me that there's something you'd rather do
than make love to me right now.

255
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,192
Actually yes.

256
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,569
Actually , what ?

257
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:31,570
Poker.

258
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:36,116
You're gonna go play poker right now?

259
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,117
Yes.

260
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:38,410
What?

261
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,664
I'll be back in a few hours,
I can drop you off wherever you want me to drop you off

262
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:45,625
Wait a minute, maybe I can come with you,
maybe somebody there wanna have sex with me.

263
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,044
Enough of this, No!

264
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,880
No, you can't come.

265
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,800
You'd be a major distraction, these guys are there to play poker, they're not there to stare at

266
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,181
Take off your bra.

267
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:50,565
I don't get it Harry, how could you have possibly lost all that money?

268
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:56,822
Not one of those horndogs had their eyes on one thing but my boobs the whole entire night .

269
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:05,205
You almost had $3,000 at one point Harry...
shuh... $3,000

270
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:11,044
I thought that Murray,?
Wasn't he the one with the cigar?

271
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:12,045
yeah, Murray.

272
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:16,133
I thought that Murray was gonna lose it all over the cards.

273
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,269
How could you lose Harry?

274
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:28,270
I don't know.

275
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:31,273
Poker is a funny game.

276
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:34,276
Funny.

277
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,280
How old are you Veronica?

278
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,281
21.

279
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:45,328
On my next birthday.

280
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,041
Let's bet.

281
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:54,921
I win, you have to do whatever I want

282
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:59,051
I figure it should be fun, Harry.

283
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,052
And if I win?

284
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:06,224
Gee, Harry, If you win
then I have to do whatever you want

285
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:08,268
-Fine.
-Fine.

286
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:18,779
there's a nine, an ace, a pair of nines,
Jack and ace, three nines,

287
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,697
Four nines.

288
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:23,492
Four of a kind.

289
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,537
Do you know the odds of getting 4 of a kind are ? five studs? five hands ?

290
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:29,748
One in 4,000.

291
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:33,210
Do you know what beats four nines?

292
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:35,879
Royal flush.

293
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:38,090
Do you know the what the odds of getting a royal flush are ?

294
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,092
One in 700,000.

295
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:44,971
And the odds in dealing both in 5 studs, is one in over 2 billion.

296
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:51,978
I obviously cheated.

297
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:54,856
I obviously don't mind.

298
00:24:56,316 --> 00:25:00,278
My dad once dealt that hand
he wasn't cheating.

299
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:03,865
It was in Lubbock, Texas, a nickel and dime game.

300
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:07,244
They shot him nine times and killed him.

301
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,875
You're very cute, Veronica
but you're bad luck.

302
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,213
I'm gonna take you home.

303
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,675
Don't touch me.

304
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:33,687
Veronica!

305
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,647
Harry, stay the fuck away from me, all right?

306
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:10,974
Damn it!

307
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:12,517
Double or nothing.

308
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:13,852
That was double or nothing.

309
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:14,853
Pay up!

310
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,403
Harry!

311
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:25,781
Chicago is outside.

312
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:40,295
How you doing Chicago?

313
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,844
Betsy's Revenge.

314
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:48,845
I know.

315
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:53,183
Say again, that you dumped $3,000 on the wrong one.

316
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:02,442
You got a flaw about you Harry, you know that.

317
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,778
Chicago, the point was of me playing the sure thing.

318
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:07,197
You don't know how it's gonna turn out.

319
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,868
There's one kind of gamblers, losers.

320
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,332
You know sometimes I can't figure out,

321
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,671
If you sound more like Duffy Duck or Sylvester the cat

322
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:25,173
What do you owe me Harry?

323
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,553
You owe me $16,000,
you got one week to come with the money.

324
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:33,640
You're despicable.

325
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:56,955
Seven days, Harry.

326
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:31,740
Seymour, don't hang up,
Seymour, don't hang up!

327
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,741
Listen to me!

328
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:35,452
Why the fuck didn't you tell me the fix was in?

329
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:40,499
All right, all right, fine!

330
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,379
Listen to me, I want $16,000 down on Astafy, ok?

331
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,382
$16,000... yes!

332
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:51,385
Astafy, it's a fucking character.

333
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:59,601
I don't give a fuck if they're messing with the calendar,
Just put that fucking bet down, you hear me?

334
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:06,608
Good morning Katie !

335
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:07,609
Mike.

336
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,363
$6,000 for a new roof!

337
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:13,156
I'm sorry honey,
That's the way it is.

338
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:15,158
Mrs. Shuster!

339
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:16,159
Good morning lieutenant!

340
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,160
Solar panels for the pool.

341
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,163
Yeah honey, but we have a pool, and a roof.

342
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:23,291
I got to go.

343
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:28,380
The tile guy is coming over, he's gonna strip my...tiles.

344
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,299
Yeah, gotta leave.

345
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,801
Goodbye Nutter!

346
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:34,094
Bye Harry.

347
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:44,980
Speaking about our conversation before.

348
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,315
Let me bring that cocksucker Chicago in.

349
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:49,943
Won't you forget about it?

350
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,404
What do you mean forget about it?
He's a fucking bookie, let the cops bring him in .

351
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:55,866
This has nothing to do with me being a cop, I gambled, I lost, I owe him.

352
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:57,701
I'm not gonna welch.

353
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:00,662
I didn't say welch.
Just give me 5 fucking minutes with this guy

354
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:02,080
I swear to god I’m...

355
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,790
We got a corpse at Salt River, let's move.

356
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,294
Now would be good.

357
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:18,597
I don't understand, why the fuck you don't break Chicago's legs?

358
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:19,890
I'm not gonna welch

359
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,642
Well give me a break with this bullshit code.

360
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:24,561
Just put a bullet behind his ear.

361
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,562
No.

362
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,064
Officer.

363
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,403
Do you know this guy ?

364
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:35,822
Who gives a shit ?

365
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:38,992
Somebody whipped off a heroin dealer.

366
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:42,829
Listen, I got a bet down that's gonna cover everything, ok?

367
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,250
All you gamblers are the same, what's next
Louie?

368
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,003
I could be a bit of a loan shark in my life.

369
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:51,296
You could do what you do and you will.

370
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,842
Freddie, this turned me on.
what about you ?

371
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:59,554
Hey guys, a little respect for the dead,
it could be someone’s father.

372
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:05,185
I fucked her.

373
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,187
Bullshit.

374
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:08,480
I did, ask her.

375
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:13,193
Give me one.

376
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:15,779
Got a light?

377
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,458
What am I, a fucking corpse?

378
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,459
Bad luck.

379
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:30,460
What bad luck?

380
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:32,462
Three on a match is bad luck.

381
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:33,463
Give me the lighter!

382
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,258
Match, lighter, it's the rule of threes, bad luck.

383
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:38,051
You superstitious fuck.
Give me a lighter.

384
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,553
I'm telling you, it's a proven scientific fact.

385
00:31:39,553 --> 00:31:40,554
They did a study about this.

386
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:42,681
I think it was over at Cornell.

387
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,684
Two guys, one lit two,
one lit threes.

388
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:48,437
The guy who lit two, was fine.
The guy who lit threes, died of cancer

389
00:31:48,437 --> 00:31:49,730
Second hand smoking.

390
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,440
Great, fucking great!

391
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:55,235
Listen why don't we shake down a couple of whorehouses ?

392
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:56,403
I'm not a pimp.

393
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:57,738
Pimps make money from whores.

394
00:31:57,738 --> 00:32:01,324
I'm not a pimp, I’m gonna be fine, just back off.

395
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,037
Listen to what I’m telling you.

396
00:32:05,037 --> 00:32:06,038
I hear you.

397
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:27,059
Hi!

398
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:31,354
What do you want?

399
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,149
How is Veronica?

400
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,948
I like your name,
Leila is a very pretty name.

401
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:43,575
Don't check up on me.

402
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,663
I didn't sleep with your daughter.

403
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,042
So you thought she was bad luck.

404
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:55,504
What kind of bullshit excuse is that?

405
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:58,715
You think making love with my daughter is bad luck?

406
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:01,093
And aren't you sweet for not sleeping with her.

407
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:02,761
You are a pig, you know that?

408
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:07,349
Veronica has never had a man in her life, that didn't end up being an asshole.

409
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,060
And you had every chance to be better than that.

410
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,938
You are a cop, for Christ sake.

411
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:18,610
She wound up in a strip joint, poker game, what’s wrong with you?

412
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:22,030
Shit!

413
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,031
Are you all right?

414
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:27,244
Would you get out of here.

415
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:29,705
Ok.

416
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:44,845
Hi, Leila!

417
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:45,846
Could we talk?

418
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:47,597
Are you hitting on me?

419
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:52,686
What is this, a penthouse letter mother and daughter combination bullshit ?

420
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:53,687
No.

421
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,481
I just wanted to tell you you're right.

422
00:33:58,108 --> 00:33:58,692
And I am sorry.

423
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:03,697
It's all, I am sorry.

424
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,187
Wait up, I'll be back in five minutes.

425
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:50,786
Carl!

426
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:54,122
Carl, wakie wakie!

427
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:56,416
Carl!

428
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:08,428
What are you doing?

429
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:10,222
Wait here.

430
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:27,948
You got a gun?

431
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:28,949
Please not here.

432
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:31,576
You got a gun, what do you need a gun for?
You know why I am here.

433
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:32,577
Right.

434
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:34,204
you got the money?

435
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,205
No.

436
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:39,710
Give me three more days.

437
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:40,711
Three days.

438
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,004
Three fucking days.
Get on your knees.

439
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,589
I'm gonna give you three minutes.

440
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:49,428
Please don't.

441
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:50,429
You got the money?

442
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:51,430
No, please don't.

443
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:55,392
Hi.

444
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:00,397
Who is this?

445
00:36:00,397 --> 00:36:01,398
Your girlfriend?

446
00:36:01,398 --> 00:36:02,399
Who is this?

447
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:06,903
My wife.

448
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:07,904
It's your wife

449
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:14,119
Do you know that you're husband owns Louie $13,000 ?

450
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:18,874
Why don't you tell your wife what you spent the money on?

451
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:20,375
Tell her.

452
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:22,377
Horses.

453
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:23,378
Horses

454
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:25,756
Horses

455
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:29,176
Horses

456
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:36,224
Whores.

457
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:38,935
Hookers, right?

458
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:42,731
Who was that little goose you paid a little extra to call you

459
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:43,732
...Uncle Carl.

460
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:44,733
You fucking scumbag.

461
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,734
What?

462
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:58,914
I’ll tell you what,
Maybe your wife can help you out.

463
00:36:58,914 --> 00:36:59,831
...No

464
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,167
Yeah, I think so.

465
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:06,004
What was the name of that little hooker ?

466
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,005
What was her name?

467
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:10,300
How old was she?
14, 15?

468
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:12,302
Cute.

469
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:17,391
Blonde...so what do you say ?

470
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:20,268
Wanna help your husband?

471
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:26,191
You don't want me to hurt him do you?

472
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:26,817
Do you?

473
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:35,742
You do something for me, I’ll do something for you.

474
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,126
Good girl.

475
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:30,338
Your wife just bought you three more days.

476
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:32,799
Three days.

477
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,647
Good morning Harry, let's go,
Chicago's finest breakfast.

478
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,163
Let's go!

479
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:33,276
Astafey.

480
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:35,946
Astafey.

481
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:37,864
Astafy.

482
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:39,449
Dostoyevsky.

483
00:39:42,828 --> 00:39:43,787
"The honest thief".

484
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,748
I never met an honest thief.

485
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:49,668
But once I knew an honest man.

486
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:51,503
Who happened to be a thief.

487
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:52,671
Did you read the book?

488
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:53,672
No.

489
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,882
I had to look that up

490
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:59,344
Cause I couldn't believe how stupid of you to drop $16,000
on that fucking horse.

491
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:01,054
Harry,

492
00:40:01,054 --> 00:40:03,098
You're down $32,000 now

493
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:07,102
What were you thinking? Only a stupid gambler would
double his bet to get back to even.

494
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:09,104
But look,

495
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:11,690
I'm in a position to help you.

496
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:16,319
There's this guy who is in the custody of your police department

497
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:19,448
And this guy likes to talk

498
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:22,534
So maybe you shut this guy up

499
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:24,828
And maybe I forget the $32,000.

500
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:25,829
Chicago,

501
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,081
You're gonna get your money.

502
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:28,749
How?

503
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:30,542
You're tapped all over town.

504
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,466
Geez, I am only asking you to pop off one lousy crook

505
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,384
for $32,000.

506
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:47,267
I am sorry about the other night ok.

507
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:50,771
Really I am, Harry.

508
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:56,443
I am under a lot of pressure, Harry.

509
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:58,737
You know what I mean?

510
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:05,494
You got 48 hours to come with the scratch
or kill that guy Joey Schneider.

511
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:08,163
The police will take care of everything.

512
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,956
and that's it?

513
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:12,542
That's all I got to do?

514
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:14,044
That's all you got to do.

515
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:17,714
And until then,
You are cut off.

516
00:41:17,714 --> 00:41:20,675
Not bets, nada.

517
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:22,928
You're not even laying down a fucking lottery ticket.

518
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,641
Until you kill this kid Harry, I own you.

519
00:41:33,855 --> 00:41:40,070
Seymour, it's Harry,
Seymour, Seymour...

520
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,167
Don't hang up.

521
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:58,797
Harvey, Harvey, ...
Please wait ...

522
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:13,395
Marvin, it's Harry, Marvin
don't hang up...

523
00:43:00,025 --> 00:43:03,528
Wait, they believe in some voodoo ritual.

524
00:43:13,997 --> 00:43:14,706
Fuck.

525
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:53,096
You got a minute Joey?

526
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:57,476
Don't you see I am fucking busy here?

527
00:44:57,476 --> 00:44:59,311
Who the fuck are you?

528
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,937
Just a cop.

529
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:08,320
Want a cigarette?

530
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:10,405
Yeah.

531
00:45:16,787 --> 00:45:19,206
I heard you were caught running pickups for Chicago.

532
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:21,625
What, me?

533
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,420
Also heard you like to gamble.

534
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,713
No, you got it wrong pal.

535
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:32,427
You ever read Dostoyevsky?

536
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:34,721
No.

537
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,473
You should.

538
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:40,644
"Crime and Punishment", "Dream of Ridiculous Men", it's killer stuff.

539
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:43,021
Dostoyevsky was a degenerate gambler.

540
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:45,649
Look I don't know anything about anybody named Chicago, all right?

541
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:47,067
Chicago?

542
00:45:49,945 --> 00:45:50,779
Forget that.

543
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:52,739
I just wanna play some cards.

544
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,250
Dostoyevsky once wrote a letter to his wife
In which he described his sensation of having an orgasm.

545
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,087
After he lost a considerable amount of money at the roulette table.

546
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:11,883
Wait, wait, this fucking Dostoi...
Dostiev...

547
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:12,884
Dostoyevsky.

548
00:46:12,884 --> 00:46:16,221
He laid down a bet, he loses and he splat .

549
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:18,765
Yeah, he splooched right there at the roulette table.

550
00:46:25,147 --> 00:46:26,148
Are you a good writer?

551
00:46:26,148 --> 00:46:28,066
The fuck is that school system you grew up in?

552
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:30,861
I don't read too good.

553
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:35,741
You bet on anything, anywhere, anytime.

554
00:46:38,493 --> 00:46:39,745
Let's play high card.

555
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:48,253
What do you got?

556
00:46:58,013 --> 00:46:58,972
Got a king.

557
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:09,900
Don't even know what the bet was.

558
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:17,324
The bet was, I win I kill you

559
00:47:17,324 --> 00:47:18,909
You win, I let you live.

560
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:23,789
Chicago likes you dead. I owe him 32 thousand dollars, what would you do in my place?

561
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:25,082
what would you do?

562
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,085
Please.

563
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:30,087
You're lucky I played aces low.

564
00:47:33,006 --> 00:47:34,841
You keep your mouth shut.

565
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:38,178
You serve me every time you got to serve, you understand me ?

566
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:41,556
If I find out you kept your mouth shut,
you get along just fine

567
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,059
You rat out Chicago,
You know what do they do to rats in prison, Joey?

568
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,061
How old are you?

569
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:47,062
20.

570
00:47:47,062 --> 00:47:49,398
Never rat out anyone.

571
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:54,111
You understand me, never,
It doesn’t pay in the long run.

572
00:48:03,537 --> 00:48:11,002
And while you're in prison, Try to read a little,
not Dostoyevsky but some Mark Twain.

573
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,390
Thank you for coming forward.

574
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,100
It's very brave of you.

575
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:29,271
I'll have to set a meeting with your attorney's office.

576
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:33,775
Now you do realize it's gonna be difficult for you to testify.

577
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:36,027
You are aware of that.

578
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:39,489
I did what I did for my husband, lieutenant.

579
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:43,869
It won't be difficult to testify against that pig Henshaw.

580
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:12,272
Yeah.

581
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:15,317
-Louie.
-Mike.

582
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:20,530
Let them in, Norm.

583
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,953
Nice job!
Collecting that $13,000 from Carl.

584
00:49:28,455 --> 00:49:29,831
yeah, well I’m very fucking sorry.

585
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:32,959
Here's your money.

586
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:38,548
Sit down.

587
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:51,561
You ever watch National Geographic
or any similar shit?

588
00:49:53,563 --> 00:49:58,402
Do I look like the kind of guy who watches National Geographic or similar shit ?

589
00:49:58,402 --> 00:49:59,903
Fascinating stuff.

590
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:06,410
I watched a story the other day about relationships.

591
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,580
About fish, Sharks, barnacles, crabs.

592
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:13,875
They achieve something.

593
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:15,419
Which I strive for.

594
00:50:15,419 --> 00:50:18,755
It's called parasitic castration.

595
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:23,552
The barnacle lives and grows inside certain crabs.

596
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:28,432
A mass of fiber, extends through the crab and actually alters

597
00:50:28,432 --> 00:50:33,145
the body of the crab, into a female,
regardless of what sex it was.

598
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:35,772
The barnacles reproduce.

599
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:39,401
But not the crab.

600
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,194
Fascinating shit!

601
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:43,405
Yeah!

602
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:47,492
Louie, check it out!

603
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:51,496
Thank you, Norm.

604
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:52,998
Want me to stick around?

605
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:56,001
I am good, Norm.

606
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,002
You sure?

607
00:50:57,002 --> 00:50:58,003
Positive.

608
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,424
My basic intuition tells me you're the new girl

609
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:05,427
That's right.

610
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:07,929
Let's see what you got.

611
00:51:14,352 --> 00:51:15,812
Mama mia!

612
00:51:19,691 --> 00:51:20,817
Come over here.

613
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:25,530
Let's see what you got.

614
00:51:50,347 --> 00:51:52,349
Nature is full of relationships, Mike.

615
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:53,517
Full of them.

616
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:55,018
Like leeches.

617
00:51:55,018 --> 00:51:58,355
They crawl into the bluefish , for example

618
00:51:58,355 --> 00:52:00,857
and suck the blood out of them.

619
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,737
The leeches have to keep the bluefish alive,

620
00:52:05,737 --> 00:52:09,449
otherwise, the leech dies.

621
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,245
The barnacles have to keep the crabs alive,

622
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:16,748
otherwise the barnacles die.

623
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:21,420
Am I getting through to you?

624
00:52:23,672 --> 00:52:24,673
Abso-fucking-lutely

625
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:28,635
You want to make an example
out of somebody who owes me money,

626
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:32,055
Make it someone who doesn't owe me a lot of money.

627
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:37,144
I need to keep my little bluefish and crabs alive.

628
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:50,574
Mike!

629
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,161
I got something for you.

630
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:56,455
Fucking come back later, I’m kinda busy right now.

631
00:52:56,455 --> 00:52:57,456
I must...

632
00:52:57,456 --> 00:52:58,665
I'm a little busy right now, come back.

633
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,668
You're not paying Dominic, are you!

634
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:03,587
Please, this is really important.

635
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,175
Just get in here.

636
00:53:09,426 --> 00:53:10,177
Hi?

637
00:53:13,805 --> 00:53:19,603
Harry... look, please don't tell Fred,

638
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:22,230
it would kill him.

639
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,523
Get the fuck out of here!

640
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:24,816
Please, Harry, I love  Fred.

641
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:26,735
Get the fuck out, Katie!

642
00:53:26,735 --> 00:53:28,403
Turn around and leave!

643
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:33,200
The fuck is the matter with you?
How the fuck could you do that to Fred?

644
00:53:38,538 --> 00:53:39,206
What do you want Harry?

645
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:44,961
what do you want?
You said you had something figured out.

646
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:47,089
What is it, what do you want?

647
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:01,561
I want Louie.

648
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:04,564
You heard me.

649
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:06,775
I want Louie.

650
00:54:11,822 --> 00:54:14,574
Listen, you know his setup, you know his timetable

651
00:54:14,574 --> 00:54:16,827
How much money he's got and where he keeps it

652
00:54:16,827 --> 00:54:20,163
Harry, why would I fucking heist Louie.

653
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:22,499
Jesus, you fuck your friend's wife, you make collections for this scumbag

654
00:54:22,499 --> 00:54:24,126
but a heist for me is out of the question?

655
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:34,136
- This isn't easy for me, Harry.
- Fine. whatever.

656
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,582
You know Harry, you got to be an honest man to work for Louie.

657
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,261
I'll go hang myself .

658
00:55:17,763 --> 00:55:18,680
You're gonna hang yourself !?

659
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:20,640
What about me?

660
00:55:21,266 --> 00:55:24,436
You don't want me to wack Chicago because there's a bullshit code that

661
00:55:24,561 --> 00:55:27,898
don't let you welch on a bet but you're gonna rob a loan shark to pay it off.

662
00:55:27,898 --> 00:55:30,776
If I don't pay back Chicago,
he's gonna fucking own me.

663
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:32,652
I'm fucked.

664
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,075
It's a perfect crime, Mike.

665
00:55:38,075 --> 00:55:40,786
We get masks, we're in, we're out, it's clean.

666
00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:42,204
He can't call the fucking cops.

667
00:55:43,747 --> 00:55:45,540
Right, and he's not gonna know what hit him.

668
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,833
Yeah, it's perfect.

669
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:52,255
You want a beer?

670
00:55:52,464 --> 00:55:53,256
No.

671
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:58,512
Mike, what's this shit with Katie,
What the fuck are you doing?

672
00:55:58,512 --> 00:56:00,097
What do you want me to say?

673
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:03,683
I want you to tell me you're not gonna pop her anymore that's for one.

674
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:05,185
she's nuts.

675
00:56:05,185 --> 00:56:07,521
She doesn't cum unless I smack her,

676
00:56:07,562 --> 00:56:10,315
Whip her, call her a whore.

677
00:56:13,026 --> 00:56:14,111
You think Fred likes it?

678
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:16,905
Whips her, calls her a whore ?

679
00:56:17,906 --> 00:56:18,698
I don't think so.

680
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:25,747
Are you gonna help me or what?

681
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,260
Sorry I had to be the one to show you these.

682
00:56:57,112 --> 00:56:58,405
In case you want to hear the audio.

683
00:56:58,405 --> 00:56:59,406
No.

684
00:56:59,406 --> 00:57:01,408
Pretty nasty stuff.

685
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:09,958
Henshaw is in all kinds of shit,
we all know that.

686
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:13,712
I got to have something solid.

687
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,549
Just give me something to put him away.

688
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:30,103
Like clockwork at 2:30 every morning they open up the safe and count the receipts.

689
00:57:30,103 --> 00:57:34,691
They keep the money in there from loan sharking operations and strip clubs.

690
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:37,110
I've seen it open with half a mill.

691
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:39,071
How many guys is gonna be around?

692
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,491
4, 5, 6 it doesn't matter,
They are not expecting us.

693
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:45,494
Who the fuck is that?

694
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:46,828
Calm down, it's all right.

695
00:57:54,086 --> 00:57:54,920
What are you doing here?

696
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:58,340
What's up ?

697
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,341
Nothing.

698
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:00,550
What's he doing here ?

699
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,718
- I invited him.
- You invited him...

700
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,261
- I invited him.
- You invited him !?

701
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:05,514
You wanna do it one more time, yes I invited him.

702
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:08,100
A, we are a team the four of us
B, we need someone to drive the car.

703
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,643
I can drive the car.

704
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:10,811
You're pissing your pants.

705
00:58:10,811 --> 00:58:12,020
I don't have to take that shit from you, all right?

706
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,772
I need the money just like you do.

707
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:14,981
You're not cut out for this.

708
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:15,774
Guys...

709
00:58:15,774 --> 00:58:18,485
Harry, I am not gonna trust this dildo to drive us around.

710
00:58:18,485 --> 00:58:20,153
What are you saying, Mike ?

711
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:21,905
I am saying that you don't have the stomach for this.

712
00:58:21,905 --> 00:58:23,240
Take it easy.

713
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,534
What the fuck you're getting so excited about, Freddie ?

714
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:27,786
I can drive a lousy car, James.

715
00:58:27,786 --> 00:58:29,454
No one said you couldn't but it's not that simple.

716
00:58:29,454 --> 00:58:30,956
For Christ sake,
You're giving me shit about it.

717
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:32,165
Guys, we don't need this,
Come on.

718
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:34,042
At least I can be trusted.

719
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:35,168
What the hell does that mean?

720
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:36,169
What the fuck does that mean?

721
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:37,170
What the fuck does that mean ?

722
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,255
Stop, stop, stop.

723
00:58:38,255 --> 00:58:39,256
We don't need this.

724
00:58:40,257 --> 00:58:42,300
Harry, talk to this prick, will you.

725
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,593
Prick ?
you're calling me a prick ?

726
00:58:43,593 --> 00:58:45,262
You fucking freak!

727
00:58:45,262 --> 00:58:46,471
Fuck you!

728
00:58:47,472 --> 00:58:48,181
Stop!

729
00:58:49,891 --> 00:58:50,517
Jesus!

730
00:58:50,517 --> 00:58:52,602
Slow down, relax.

731
00:58:53,603 --> 00:58:54,396
Listen to me Mike,

732
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,189
it's gonna take three of us to knock over Louie, right?

733
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:57,190
- Right.
- Ok!

734
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,067
We need someone to drive the car.

735
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:01,278
I would have felt more comfortable if Fred is driving the fucking car.

736
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:02,696
What's the big fucking deal?

737
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:06,408
- Will you pay him out of your money.
- Fine! whatever. Come on!

738
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:09,953
Fred, you're driving the car.

739
00:59:09,953 --> 00:59:10,954
Sit down.

740
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:30,182
Robert Johnson, huh?

741
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:32,601
It's a very antique jukebox !?

742
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:34,978
How are you ?

743
00:59:37,564 --> 00:59:38,273
What's the name of this song ?

744
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:41,068
Terraplane Blues.

745
00:59:41,068 --> 00:59:42,486
My grandpa used to have this car.

746
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:45,906
Said he got it to 88 miles/h and that was in 1938.

747
00:59:45,906 --> 00:59:47,574
The song isn't about a car.

748
00:59:47,574 --> 00:59:48,575
Really?

749
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:51,578
You think there's a hidden meaning to the line: who's been

750
00:59:51,578 --> 00:59:54,498
Driving my Terraplane Blues since I’ve been gone?

751
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:59,461
Maybe I’m wrong, but the line :
I’m gonna get down deep in this connection

752
00:59:59,461 --> 01:00:01,463
Keep on tanglin' with your wires

753
01:00:01,463 --> 01:00:04,591
Seems to me it's about a guy singing about a shortage in his wiring system.

754
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:07,719
I flash my lights, mama,
but this horn won't even blow.

755
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:11,139
Aha, little generator won't get the spark.

756
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:12,599
Am I getting through to you ?

757
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:14,601
No.

758
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,103
You're still a pig.

759
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,398
I know.

760
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:27,030
I bought you a present.

761
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:30,117
I don't want it.

762
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:32,411
Something to remember me by.

763
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:44,715
It's a little pink pig watch.

764
01:00:47,217 --> 01:00:48,802
If you press this button right here

765
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:49,386
Go on.

766
01:00:56,017 --> 01:00:57,352
See, so you're all right.

767
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:00,230
I am a pig.
Here you go.

768
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:05,736
you get your own pig watch.

769
01:01:08,155 --> 01:01:08,864
Thanks a whole lot.

770
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:09,865
You're welcome.

771
01:01:13,076 --> 01:01:14,036
Don't you want a drink or something.

772
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:17,164
No.

773
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:21,918
You know a place where we could get a good pie ?

774
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:23,920
No.

775
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,255
Apple, it's really good.

776
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:29,801
I don't wanna get a pie with you.

777
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,181
I don't like it.

778
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:42,355
You like the watch don't you.

779
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:43,356
Oh I love it.

780
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:54,951
You sure you don't wanna get something to eat?

781
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:57,287
No, I ate, I have to get home.

782
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:03,585
Early. it's only...see

783
01:02:03,585 --> 01:02:04,586
Here you go.

784
01:02:04,586 --> 01:02:05,712
Fine.

785
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,299
Oh, man.

786
01:02:23,397 --> 01:02:24,564
Wanna go to the movies or something?

787
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:26,566
I can't.

788
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:27,567
Why ?

789
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:29,528
Why you busy ?

790
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:30,529
I just can't.

791
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:38,495
If the drop on the left here,
beats the drop on the right,

792
01:02:38,495 --> 01:02:39,913
you have to go to the movies with me.

793
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,416
They are off!

794
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:47,170
- Come on, come on, left, left...
- Oh...

795
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:50,549
I won.

796
01:02:54,761 --> 01:02:58,014
We bet.
Can't welch.

797
01:03:48,482 --> 01:03:51,151
- I told you, it's perfect.
- Let's hope they can find this shithole in the dark.

798
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:52,736
Maybe they're lost.

799
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:01,286
What's up with Fred ?
He's like a little edgy lately.

800
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:03,538
Then stop fucking his wife.

801
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:04,539
Maybe that will help.

802
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,000
It's a good point.

803
01:04:20,472 --> 01:04:21,139
Here !

804
01:04:26,478 --> 01:04:28,105
I got you a taco.

805
01:04:29,523 --> 01:04:30,440
Where did you get that shit.

806
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,733
The only place that was open,
do you want it ?

807
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:33,318
The fuck did I just say, no.

808
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:36,154
- Fine.
- My ass will burn if I ate that.

809
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:37,155
Fine.

810
01:04:41,326 --> 01:04:42,452
What time does the bartender leave ?

811
01:04:42,452 --> 01:04:48,709
2:30, I don't know,
2:30, approximately more or less.

812
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:52,546
What kind of guns do Louie's guys carry ?

813
01:04:52,546 --> 01:04:55,882
9mm, 12 gauge bore diameter.

814
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:02,180
There he is.

815
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:10,188
- I don't know
- Mike...

816
01:05:11,189 --> 01:05:12,899
Are you sure about the money being there?

817
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:14,818
What the fuck is wrong with you tonight ?

818
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:16,570
Nothing, nothing.

819
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:25,662
I know a man that used to work for a loan shark.

820
01:05:28,206 --> 01:05:28,957
So ?

821
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:31,543
He used to tell me the worst thing a gambler can do

822
01:05:31,585 --> 01:05:33,628
Is borrow money from the loan shark.

823
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,922
Loan shops are okay, but not loan sharks.

824
01:05:35,922 --> 01:05:39,718
Harry, borrowing money from a loan shark
and stealing money from a loan shark

825
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:40,719
are two different things.

826
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:42,596
It's still coming from a loan shark though, Mike.

827
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:50,479
It's better than cheating.

828
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,689
I'd never cheat, never.

829
01:05:52,689 --> 01:05:55,859
Gamblers who cheat are more interested in money than gambling.

830
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:57,360
What's money ?

831
01:06:01,448 --> 01:06:02,407
I don't gamble to make money.

832
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:04,368
No shit.

833
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:34,022
You think that's fucking funny ?

834
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:35,982
Hell yes, I think that's funny.

835
01:06:35,982 --> 01:06:37,275
That's damn funny.

836
01:06:37,275 --> 01:06:39,236
What's wrong with you anyway ?

837
01:06:39,236 --> 01:06:42,197
Somebody a little testy today ?

838
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:43,824
Not in the mood for you funny shit that's all.

839
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,078
Oh, I see what it actually is.

840
01:06:48,078 --> 01:06:51,790
It's a case of a little testy.

841
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,417
You want a fucking piece, motherfucker ?

842
01:06:57,754 --> 01:06:59,047
- You can't take a hit ?
- Knock it off!

843
01:07:00,924 --> 01:07:02,134
What the hell is going on right here, guys ?

844
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:02,843
Is the heat getting to you ?

845
01:07:03,844 --> 01:07:05,679
I am talking on the goddamn phone.

846
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,597
Keep this shit out.

847
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:10,058
Detective Shuster.

848
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:14,730
Katie, no, we already told them once.

849
01:07:16,606 --> 01:07:19,901
Listen to me, do what I say, just take care of it!

850
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:23,739
What are you looking at ?

851
01:07:25,782 --> 01:07:26,783
Take it easy, Fred.

852
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:31,329
Has anybody seen my lighter ?

853
01:07:33,415 --> 01:07:34,249
No.

854
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:40,464
God damn it!

855
01:07:42,424 --> 01:07:43,467
Tell me about taking it easy.

856
01:07:46,053 --> 01:07:46,845
Did you steal it ?

857
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:49,514
- Did you take it ?
- No, I didn't steal your fucking lighter.

858
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:50,515
Son of a bitch.

859
01:07:51,808 --> 01:07:54,186
It's the only thing my dad gave me.
It's my lucky piece.

860
01:07:54,186 --> 01:07:56,104
Why would I steal your father's lighter.

861
01:07:56,104 --> 01:07:57,939
Because you are a sadistic fuck, that's why!

862
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,441
Fine.

863
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:02,944
This is not good.

864
01:08:04,071 --> 01:08:04,905
Not good.

865
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:11,078
I need some air.

866
01:08:11,078 --> 01:08:12,079
Where ?

867
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,705
it's fucking Phoenix, there is no air.

868
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:18,460
John, you got some matches ?

869
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:20,587
Here you go.

870
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:21,588
Thanks.

871
01:08:48,115 --> 01:08:49,074
Hi.

872
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,829
So you came to collect on the rain drop ?

873
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,959
That's the first bet I have won in a long time.

874
01:08:58,959 --> 01:09:00,293
Wanna take me to the movies ?

875
01:09:00,293 --> 01:09:00,961
Yes.

876
01:09:00,961 --> 01:09:02,754
Tonight is not a good night but...

877
01:09:09,136 --> 01:09:10,595
So why did you come to see me ?

878
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:20,313
I've lost something of mine, that brought me
a lot of good luck in the past.

879
01:09:20,313 --> 01:09:24,443
And I just wanted to have something of yours for luck.

880
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:27,028
I wouldn't know what good luck looks like.

881
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:29,740
It's really important to me.

882
01:09:31,658 --> 01:09:32,951
what do you want it for, Harry ?

883
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,162
It doesn't matter.

884
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,749
why ask me, why not somebody else ?

885
01:09:43,587 --> 01:09:44,337
Because I like you.

886
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,300
And I just wanted to come from you.

887
01:09:51,344 --> 01:09:52,262
You're a gambler.

888
01:09:52,262 --> 01:09:54,222
You wanna change your luck.

889
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:58,018
Get yourself sucked out of whatever this shit you got yourself into.

890
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,688
Just don't gamble with me.

891
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:03,607
I won't.

892
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,421
can I have those matches ?

893
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:31,009
I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.

894
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,010
I'd like that

895
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:35,180
Harry!

896
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:45,315
Thanks.

897
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:40,954
Give me one will you.

898
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,134
Get over your scientific facts.

899
01:11:54,134 --> 01:11:56,053
I believe it was Cornell University?

900
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,488
- Hey, Mr. Slik, how is it going ?
- Great.

901
01:12:14,488 --> 01:12:17,532
- Listen.
- Hmm, it's all right.

902
01:12:17,532 --> 01:12:19,368
No, no, it's all there.

903
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:23,622
Hi, baby!

904
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:24,915
Come over here

905
01:12:31,922 --> 01:12:32,964
Let's go.

906
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:43,642
What's that ?

907
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,643
Lubricant.

908
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:48,397
You think you're Frank Sinatra or something?

909
01:12:49,773 --> 01:12:52,818
Women just look at you and zang...
Instant wet.

910
01:13:04,579 --> 01:13:05,330
It's all right boys?

911
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:08,417
Hey Norm, I'm next.

912
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,793
Knock yourself out dog.

913
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:13,899
What the fuck am I doing here ?

914
01:14:17,027 --> 01:14:23,033
Oh yeah, oh god...

915
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:24,034
Oh god !

916
01:14:26,203 --> 01:14:27,454
Get the fuck out!

917
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:37,089
Listen to me, I want you to get up, open the safe
and put the money in the bag.

918
01:14:37,089 --> 01:14:38,090
Now!

919
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,091
Can we talk about it.

920
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:40,092
Shut up!

921
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:41,426
Open the motherfucking safe!

922
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:42,636
We can make a deal here.

923
01:14:42,636 --> 01:14:45,555
Get up, open the safe, put the money in the bag.

924
01:14:45,555 --> 01:14:46,556
Now!

925
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:48,058
Who the fuck do you think I am, a Swiss bank?
Fuck you!

926
01:14:56,983 --> 01:14:58,985
God damn it,
What the fuck is the matter with you ?

927
01:15:00,987 --> 01:15:01,822
Open the safe motherfucker.

928
01:15:01,822 --> 01:15:02,823
Now.

929
01:15:02,823 --> 01:15:03,824
Come on!

930
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:07,828
You guys are dead.

931
01:15:07,828 --> 01:15:09,454
I hope you know that.

932
01:15:09,454 --> 01:15:11,373
Just give us the fucking money, Louie.

933
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:23,385
Parasitic castration is gonna be a pic nic compared to what's gonna happen to you.

934
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,138
Fuck you and your barnacles.

935
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:31,101
No, Mike, no !!!

936
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:56,835
If only I had my dad's lucky lighter

937
01:15:56,835 --> 01:15:58,837
What the fuck you doing bitch

938
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:01,882
It's a piece of gum, for Pete’s sake.

939
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:03,967
Don't do it, down !

940
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,968
Please don't kill me !

941
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,806
All right, all right.
Nobody is gonna shoot you.

942
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:15,562
Do you the combination to the safe ?

943
01:16:15,562 --> 01:16:17,564
I don't know, only Louie does.

944
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:20,650
Only Louie.

945
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:24,404
Does anybody here knows how to crack a safe ?

946
01:16:26,948 --> 01:16:29,242
Does anybody here have a borescope or a drill?

947
01:16:29,242 --> 01:16:30,869
I left it by the motherfucking jacket.

948
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:32,245
Don't get testy, Mike.

949
01:16:32,245 --> 01:16:34,581
You're the one who shot Louie, before he got to open the safe.

950
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:36,166
I had no choice.

951
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:37,167
Stop!

952
01:16:41,254 --> 01:16:42,589
Can't you just take the whole safe ?

953
01:16:42,589 --> 01:16:44,591
No, it's bolted down.

954
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:48,303
But I once knew a guy who opened a safe with an industrial vibrator.

955
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,304
What's your  name?

956
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,305
Bert.

957
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,515
Bert, shut the fuck up!

958
01:16:51,515 --> 01:16:54,684
You can use a stethoscope.
You can listen for the tumbler.

959
01:16:54,684 --> 01:16:56,395
Sh, sh.

960
01:16:56,395 --> 01:16:58,271
Chew your gum, ok?

961
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:03,985
- You got the yellow pages?
- Yeah.

962
01:17:03,985 --> 01:17:04,986
Where?

963
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:05,987
In the desk drawer.

964
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:06,988
What side ?

965
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:07,989
The right side.

966
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,658
The right from here or the right from there ?

967
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:10,826
This side over there.

968
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:15,455
Excuse me genius.

969
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:16,957
Don't trip on the body.

970
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:28,009
Monk locksmith, 24h dispatch, no lock we can't open

971
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:31,388
20% discount for first timers.

972
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,199
God damn it!

973
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,042
Get fucking moving,
don't turn around.

974
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:17,142
It's ok, we're first time customers,
if you do this in a hurry we'll forget about the 20%.

975
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:18,560
It's right over here.

976
01:18:47,381 --> 01:18:50,801
I just had to drill to see where the tumbler fall.

977
01:18:57,682 --> 01:19:00,143
See, I never met a safe I couldn't open.

978
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:14,074
Here you go, thanks a lot.

979
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:16,660
Here you go.

980
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,498
Hey let's not forget to keep our mouth shut.

981
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:36,596
Sup Fred!
Let's go Fred!

982
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,643
Fred!  Jesus Christ, come on

983
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,270
What the fuck is wrong with you?

984
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:52,362
Let's go.

985
01:20:57,677 --> 01:20:58,595
I fucked up.

986
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,473
Don't worry about it.

987
01:21:04,518 --> 01:21:05,685
You guys killed anybody up there ?

988
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:07,979
Yeah.

989
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,026
How much you think we got?

990
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:22,994
Minus $32,000 for Chicago, $40
for the masks, I say about $152,000.

991
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:28,417
How many did you guys kill ?

992
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,919
Fred, can we talk about something else ?

993
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:37,467
Step up, will you.

994
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:41,096
You don't think Harry will fuck us out of the money, will you ?

995
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,099
Harry, no, no way.

996
01:21:45,642 --> 01:21:46,852
Drive a little faster, ok?

997
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:51,815
What the fuck is going on ?

998
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:53,108
Why you stopping?

999
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:58,488
- The fucking car is out of gas.
- We ran out of gas ?!

1000
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:02,200
- You didn't put gas in the car ?
- I put the fucking gas in the car!

1001
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,201
For fuck sake!

1002
01:22:31,104 --> 01:22:32,189
There it is.

1003
01:22:32,189 --> 01:22:34,191
We did it, Fred.

1004
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:37,778
Harry, you didn't fuck Katie, did you ?

1005
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:39,196
What ?

1006
01:22:40,197 --> 01:22:41,198
did you fuck Katie ?

1007
01:22:42,616 --> 01:22:43,617
No.

1008
01:22:44,201 --> 01:22:45,494
Did Mike fuck her ?

1009
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:47,079
What are you talking about, Fred ?

1010
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:50,957
He's talking about Henshaw fucking his wife.

1011
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:54,086
You knew about it Harry, why didn't you tell him ?

1012
01:22:58,882 --> 01:23:00,092
Tell me you didn't do this, Fred.

1013
01:23:03,887 --> 01:23:05,555
It's over Harry, step away from the bag.

1014
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,525
It' ok Fred, you did the right thing.

1015
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,528
Good job.

1016
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:21,321
Fred !

1017
01:23:52,769 --> 01:23:54,146
What the fuck you looking at ?

1018
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,035
- Harry won't fuck us huh ?
- I told you he won't fuck us.

1019
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,332
Shit.

1020
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:49,951
Fuck !!!

1021
01:24:58,126 --> 01:24:59,419
I hate fucking gamblers.

1022
01:25:06,259 --> 01:25:07,010
So they were definitely three.

1023
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:10,472
Yes, three, pig, monkey and bunny rabbit.

1024
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:11,473
All right.

1025
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,148
Put out an APB on Harry Collins.

1026
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,944
and find Nutter and Henshaw,
and keep it off the radio.

1027
01:25:23,944 --> 01:25:25,654
Make them think we're just going after Harry.

1028
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,739
Maybe they'll lead us to him.

1029
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:28,865
All right, sir.

1030
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:32,619
It's over Harry.

1031
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:47,426
Us losers stick together.

1032
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,393
Bet's a bet.

1033
01:26:05,277 --> 01:26:06,653
The police found out the plates.

1034
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:43,356
Nutter is mine.

1035
01:26:59,664 --> 01:27:01,166
Mike, let's make this quick.
In and out.

1036
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:20,727
He's been here.

1037
01:27:23,647 --> 01:27:24,356
Harry !

1038
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:27,150
Come on you cocksucker !

1039
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:29,152
Fuck this man.

1040
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:42,290
Shit.

1041
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:46,586
Harry !!!

1042
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:47,587
Fuck!

1043
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:49,381
James !

1044
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:52,217
Mike !

1045
01:27:59,725 --> 01:28:00,600
Fuck him.

1046
01:28:39,931 --> 01:28:40,766
We're fucked, Mike?

1047
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:42,184
Why ?

1048
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:53,195
Coming out !

1049
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:54,196
What the fuck are you doing ?

1050
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:55,197
Coming out, don't shoot!

1051
01:28:55,197 --> 01:28:56,198
Put it down, James.

1052
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:59,368
I'll do it, you know I’ll do it.

1053
01:29:01,078 --> 01:29:01,995
Cocksuckers !

1054
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:19,179
Your name is Harry ?

1055
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,184
No.

1056
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,604
Mine's Dolores

1057
01:29:27,312 --> 01:29:32,901
Radio says you robbed and murdered a loan shark.

1058
01:29:36,029 --> 01:29:38,073
Does the radio also say I have a bullet hole?

1059
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,285
You don't look like you're from Phoenix.

1060
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:49,084
This city exists for god only knows why it exists.

1061
01:29:50,335 --> 01:29:54,381
Legend says that some guy sold his soul for exchange

1062
01:29:54,381 --> 01:29:56,299
of water supply.

1063
01:29:58,093 --> 01:29:59,761
It's not my soul I am worried about.

1064
01:30:01,763 --> 01:30:03,515
it's my luck, Dolores.

1065
01:30:03,515 --> 01:30:08,478
It's never too late to try to change it.

1066
01:30:19,322 --> 01:30:21,074
Can you turn this up, please ?

1067
01:30:21,074 --> 01:30:23,785
Robert Johnson.
Thanks.

1068
01:32:14,604 --> 01:32:15,605
Oh, daddy...

1069
01:32:30,537 --> 01:32:33,999
Katie, you're definitely a whore's whore.

1070
01:32:36,376 --> 01:32:37,586
How are you doing lieutenant?

1071
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:38,587
Fuck you.

1072
01:32:40,213 --> 01:32:42,424
That cuff, Clyde, bet she made you do it.

1073
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:57,773
Katie... you weren't gonna cuff him, were you ?

1074
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:26,259
Is that what you're after, Harry. The money ?

1075
01:33:26,259 --> 01:33:29,054
Why don't you take it and get the hell out of here.

1076
01:33:29,054 --> 01:33:30,055
Are you crazy ?

1077
01:33:43,652 --> 01:33:44,569
Harry...

1078
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:02,879
Did you ever see King Kong ?

1079
01:34:02,879 --> 01:34:03,880
What ?

1080
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,383
Bunch of natives on this island.

1081
01:34:06,383 --> 01:34:09,386
They build this wall, to keep out this giant gorilla.

1082
01:34:09,386 --> 01:34:13,348
But they put two giant doors, big enough for the gorilla to fit through,

1083
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:15,142
right in the walls.

1084
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:17,686
Doesn't make sense

1085
01:34:19,813 --> 01:34:21,732
Please, stop burning the money.

1086
01:34:25,235 --> 01:34:27,154
Ok ?

1087
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:29,072
I'll do anything.

1088
01:34:31,658 --> 01:34:32,951
No shit

1089
01:34:35,412 --> 01:34:37,205
Fred saw that movie a hundred times.

1090
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:40,959
I bet you didn't know that, Katie.

1091
01:35:03,565 --> 01:35:04,691
What are you doing Harry ?

1092
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:07,694
Harry, don't do it !

1093
01:35:07,694 --> 01:35:09,529
Don't fucking do it!!!

1094
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,203
Gus, it's Harry...
I know Gus, I know

1095
01:35:16,203 --> 01:35:17,829
Just listen to me, okay ?

1096
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:23,335
Send some guys over to Webber's house

1097
01:35:23,335 --> 01:35:25,545
I think you need to find the gun that killed  Fred.

1098
01:35:25,545 --> 01:35:29,299
And you'll find Fred's body in a shack 3 miles south of Providence.

1099
01:35:29,299 --> 01:35:31,093
It's on route 6.

1100
01:35:38,225 --> 01:35:40,519
I'm taking some envelopes and stamps.

1101
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,734
- I'm borrowing your car.
- Just go, just get the fuck out of here!

1102
01:35:47,734 --> 01:35:48,735
Clyde.

1103
01:36:00,163 --> 01:36:01,164
Give me the fucking keys!

1104
01:37:44,935 --> 01:37:46,436
There you go buddy.

1105
01:38:43,827 --> 01:38:45,245
Jesus Christ, Harry!

1106
01:38:46,371 --> 01:38:47,330
You look like shit.

1107
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:53,837
Never knew when the loan shark have left the building

1108
01:38:56,381 --> 01:38:58,550
and the cops came looking for you.

1109
01:39:01,094 --> 01:39:03,597
Excuse me, could I have a piece of apple pie ?

1110
01:39:03,597 --> 01:39:05,891
With some vanilla ice cream on top

1111
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:09,895
It's OK Esmeralda, get him some pie.

1112
01:39:22,824 --> 01:39:23,742
$32,000.

1113
01:39:42,636 --> 01:39:43,178
Here you go.

1114
01:39:58,485 --> 01:39:59,694
Thank you Esmeralda.

1115
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:10,956
That's the pie.

1116
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:20,382
That kid Joey, I talked to him, and he's not gonna rat on you.

1117
01:40:22,676 --> 01:40:23,343
Do you know what he said ?

1118
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,769
It's all there, Harry.

1119
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,897
We're back in business.

1120
01:40:39,276 --> 01:40:40,861
No... I got myself a new hobby.

1121
01:40:48,243 --> 01:40:50,162
I am not gonna end up like my dad, Chicago.

1122
01:40:50,162 --> 01:40:51,163
Oh...

1123
01:40:55,792 --> 01:40:59,546
By the way Harry... that kid
Joey Schneider

1124
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:05,427
He's dead anyway, ...
I slit his throat

1125
01:41:09,264 --> 01:41:10,474
Next time listen to me

1126
01:41:12,809 --> 01:41:15,479
It could have saved us whole lots of angst.

1127
01:41:54,184 --> 01:42:01,858
It's ok, I am a cop.

1128
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:13,161
There you go, keep the change.
