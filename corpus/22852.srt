 I don't ever wanna see you again.  Is that clear ?

519
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,150
  Hey, what's goin' on here ? - Carter, you're in enough trouble.

520
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,120
  Just shut up. Stay out of it.

521
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,460
  You're goin' back to L.A..  Right now.

522
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,150
  That's fine with me, man. I ain't had fun since I been out here.

523
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,990
 Okay.

524
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,630
  Sorry, Lee.

525
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,530
  - Escort detective Carter to the airport.  - No.

526
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,700
 I'll take him. Get your hands off !

527
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,440
 Carter, you don't understand.

528
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,150
  Oh, I understand, all right.

529
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,440
  I got knocked off a building,  I got beat on,

530
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,940
  I got stripped butt-naked, and you held out on me, man.

531
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,720
  I'm outta here.

532
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,720
 [ door closes ]

533
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,150
  Carter, Ricky Tan set up my father.

534
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,780
  What ?

535
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,190
 Five years ago, my father was working  a big international smuggling case.

536
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,280
 He found out his partner, Tan, was working for the triads.

537
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,290
  But before he could prove it, he was killed.

538
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,330
  All the evidence disappeared,

539
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,640
  Tan resigned, and the case was never solved.

540
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,790
 So I get it now. This is all about your daddy's last case.

541
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,670
 So you gettin' on the plane with me or not ?

542
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,170
  What ? You know my daddy died on the job too.

543
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,340
 If I had a chance to square his death,  I'd do whatever it took.

544
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,300
 I'd do anything. so you comin' or what ?

545
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,810
  Why L.A.. ?

546
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,410
  Lee, let me introduce you to Carter's theory of criminal investigation:

547
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,310
  follow the rich white man.

548
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,890
  Follow the rich white man ?  -Exactly. Now you're learning.

549
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,020
  Every big crime has a rich white man  behind it waitin' for his cut.

550
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,410
  Now in our case, we know who the rich white man is.

551
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,190
  Steven Reign.  -Who ?

552
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,920
 Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.  I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.

553
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,190
  When the shootin' started, he was way too cool.

554
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,300
 I'm gonna tell you somethin'. when people start shootin', white people ain't that cool.

555
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,290
  they either runnin' around, hidin' behind tables, or screamin' like, "aah !"

556
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,860
  - Shh ! - You sound like that all the time.

557
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,230
  Let me tell you somethin' about black people.

558
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,560
  When stuff goes down, we keep our cool.

559
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,510
  -Maybe, but not like Asians, we never panic. - Yeah, right.

560
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,370
  When godzilla's comin', y'all be trippin'.

561
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,900
  I seen the movie. you be, "gaica, gaica !" -Carter.

562
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,940
  yellin' everywhere. I seen Chinamen-- just--

563
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,610
  Mr. Carter, excuse me. -Thank you so much.  It's the kosher meal ?

564
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,610
 Yes, sir, that is.  -Our kosher meal. Shalom.

565
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,490
  There he is, right there.

566
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,070
  Mr. Steven Reign, livin' large in one of his penthouse suites.

567
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,690
  Oh, guess who this is. Yep, that's her.

568
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,530
 That's the woman that was on Ricky Tan's boat, right there.

569
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,190
 We got 'em.

570
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,620
 Told you it'd work out. Know what I'm talkin' about.

571
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,160
 All we gotta do now is wait.

572
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,030
 They still talkin' ?  Hmm.

573
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,030
  He's leaving.

574
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,770
  - He'll be back. - How do you know ?

575
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,040
 I know.  You see how fine that woman is ?

576
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,260
  He'll definitely be back.

577
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,810
  - What's she doing ? - uh--

578
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,220
  What's she doin', man ?

579
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,340
  She's just standing around, not doing much.

580
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,040
 Well, just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later, something's gonna happen.

581
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,750
 Okay, I just try to stay awake. It's just so boring.

582
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,420
  Oh.  Slow down, baby.

583
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,450
  - What ? - Huh ?

584
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,450
  - Nothing.  I said nothing. - You said somethin'.

585
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,790
  - I said nothing. - I heard you say somethin'.

586
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,760
  N-n-no. noth-nothing.

587
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,160
  [ sighs ] ah.

588
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,300
  Lee, what's goin' on, man ? What you talkin' about ?

589
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,290
  She's getting undressed. - What ?

590
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,230
  She's just getting undressed.  -Give me that !

591
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,570
  No ! It's not right !

592
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,770
  [ Carter ] Lord, have mercy ! -What ?

593
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,470
 She took her skirt off.  Oh, I-- I cannot hear this.

594
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,100
  Black panties,  black bra--

595
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,600
  Victoria's secret, spring catalog, page 27.

596
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,110
  Girl got class.

597
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,450
  Let me look a little closer. Oh, look at that.

598
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,410
  Got a little tattoo. That's cute.

599
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,510
  Looks like snoopy.

600
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,080
  Snoopy ?  Yeah.

601
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,810
  I love snoopy. Wait. - I love snoopy too. Let me look at this thing.

602
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,740
  Hold up. Wait a minute.

603
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,680
 She's goin' to the door. Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's goin' to the door.

604
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,420
  She's openin' the door.

605
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,880
  Look like somebody droppin' off a package.

606
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,890
  Wait a minute.

607
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,650
  Look like the same girl who dropped off the package at your office.

608
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,590
  It's a bomb ! Bomb !

609
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,930
  [ horns honking ]  Watch out !  Watch out !

610
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,600
 [ skidding sound ]

611
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,260
 It's this one right here, I think.  Hey, lady, you got a bomb in there !

612
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,370
  Open that door !

613
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,300
  Kick the door.

614
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,300
  What the-- No, no, no, no !

615
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,480
 Damn, you fine. Carter !

616
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,200
  Come on, Lee !  Come on !

617
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,560
  Where ? Don't drop it ! Come on, this way !

618
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,070
  Where should we go ?

619
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,040
 I bajate !   I bajate, senora !

620
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,210
  Roof ! Roof !

621
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,210
 Don't trip ! Be careful !

622
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,070
 Throw it,  Lee ! - Where ?

623
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,850
 Lee, throw it !  -Where ?

624
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,250
  Throw the bomb over the edge !  -Throw it !  Throw it !

00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,750
  Throw it over the edge !  -No, there's people down there !

  Lee, throw it ! Lee !  Carter !  Carter !

  Lee ! throw it !  Carter ! No !

  We about to die !

629
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,660
 Okay, get on your feet.

630
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,350
  - Enough, all right ? - Put that down !

631
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,630
  It's a bomb ! Hey ! Put that down !

632
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,630
 Guys, no bomb. Nothing.

633
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,660
 Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.

634
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,800
  Throw us in jail ?

635
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,560
  Lady, you must be outta your mind.   I'm about to bust you right now.

636
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,400
 I'm an undercover agent for the United States secret service.

637
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,510
  - How do we know that ?   Show me a badge right now.  - Here you go.

638
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,770
  Let me see that again. I- I didn't get a good look at that.

639
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,100
  We can help you. I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

640
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,970
 I know who you are, Inspector Lee.  I know.

641
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,640
 We need to go out of sight, so come down to my suite.

642
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,920
 Now why did you say it was a bomb ? - No, you said that.

643
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,580
 No, you said it. -You said that in the hotel room.

644
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,920
 I said she was the bomb.

645
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,150
  She was the bomb ?

646
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,460
  Look, I've been working this case for months now,

647
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,690
  So if I seem a little aggravated, I apologize.

648
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,290
 You need to tell us what's goin' on.

649
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,850
 The triads and Reign, they think I'm a crooked customs agent.

650
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,360
  - Is that a payoff ? - No.  That's a sample.

651
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,360
  You guys ever heard of the superbill ?

652
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,830
 I heard of it.  It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.

653
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,340
  Honey, it's much more than a counterfeit.

654
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,890
  Fourteen out of fifteen world banks  can't even tell the difference.

655
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,200
 The paper is crane linen blend, and the bills are printed on U.S. intaglio presses.

656
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,900
 You wanna tell us how in the world  they get into the U.S. mint to use the presses ?

657
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,900
  In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the shah of Iran.

658
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,570
  Why ?  Because we wanted his oil.

659
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,830
  Our government gave him a gift--

660
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,780
  A U.S. treasury intaglio printing press.

661
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
  Now, it's the only one to ever leave the country.

662
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,450
  Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought  the press on the black market.

663
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,980
  Five years ago ? Mm-hmm.

664
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,610
  That's right before he left the force.

665
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,610
 Earlier this year, Ricky Tan got a hold of one-of-a-kind swiss-made hundred-dollar plates,

666
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,410
  and he started printing superbills.

667
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,780
  that's why Hu Li killed him-- for the plates.

668
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,590
 and they've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars.

669
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,420
 There's only one way to spot a fake.

670
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,560
 They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red.

671
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,620
  You see ? Now, the real ink, it burns black.

672
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,530
 So what in the hell they gonna do  with $100 million of phony money ?

673
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,560
  You know, Carter, I believe you're asking the wrong question.

674
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,800
  The real question is, where are the plates ?

675
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,570
  Because if we can find the plates,  we can stop the whole operation.

676
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,040
  - Right ? - Yeah, you're right.

677
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,930
  Maybe this is where you can help us, guys.

678
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,870
  Yeah.  I mean, Carter, This is your city, right ?

679
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,270
 Yeah, this is my titty. I mean, this is my city.

680
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,170
  Great.  And Lee, you know Hu Li and the triads, correct ?

681
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,540
  -Yes.  -Great.

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,960
  Hey, you know what ? I got somethin' for you too.

1181
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,840
  What is this ?  -That's $10,000, man.

1182
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,740
  I got it at the tables this mornin' at Caesar's.  I'm still hot.

1183
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:52,010
  I can't take this. -No, don't worry about it. I got a lot more.

1184
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:55,370
  Go ahead.  Enjoy yourself. -No, Carter. I can't have this.

1185
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:58,380
 Would you stop actin' like a cop for one second, man, and live it up ?

1186
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,480
  There gotta be something you want.  Come on.

1187
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:02,410
  Think about it.

1188
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:06,140
  [ woman on p.a. ]  This is the final boarding call for flight 44 to La Guardia.

1189
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,090
  I always wanted to go to Madison square garden, see the knicks play.

1190
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,260
  -New York city ?  - First class.

1191
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,850
  -The plaza hotel ?   -Maybe a little mu shu ?

1192
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,550
  - Amen to that, brother.   -So, what do you say ?

1193
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:22,720
  You know what, man ? I can use another vacation.

1194
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,430
