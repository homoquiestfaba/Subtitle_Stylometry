There, in the tree.

Save yourself Goben.

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,036
I cannot go with you.

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,046
The Passage... It is near!

Ggggoooo!

This will heal you.

Thank you Papa.

19
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,616
I made a good trade.

20
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Thank you Tak-tek.

21
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,640
Where is Goben?

22
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,150
Aaaahh!

23
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,126
Is this the termite that took
your eye?

24
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,150
All the same to me.

25
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,160
Aaaaaahhh!!

26
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,670
Where are the others and
the village?

27
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,670
Where village?

28
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
[Growl}.

29
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,700
Where village?

30
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,186
Rock men!, Rock Men have
attacked!

31
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,187
The old ones? Where?

32
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,210
The orchard! They attacked as we
worked.

33
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,710
This medicine stone to make
you strong.

34
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,720
Goben is here. He says
Rock-Men are coming.

35
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,696
Omi take Chi-Cha Home.

36
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,697
Umhm.

37
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:33,230
Stay there.

38
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,207
Father!

39
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,706
Goben!

40
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,706
You're ok.

41
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,240
KayLay and Gelling, everyone was
taken. We need to go after them.

42
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,240
We cannot fight the rock men.

43
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,240
The Giants can fight, we can ask
them for help.

44
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,726
We have no contact with Giants
and Don't want it!

45
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,727
They are dangerous.

46
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,726
Goben is right.

47
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,226
Listen Please!

48
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,736
We must leave home now.

49
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,260
We must hide in the jungle.
Take what you own and go!

50
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,760
What is that?

51
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,770
Rock Men!!

52
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,300
Walk Chi Cha, Walk!

53
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
No!, No!

54
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,786
Omi!

55
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
My Omi!

56
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,797
Tak-Tek Find Omi!

57
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,796
I Will take mother to the field.

58
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Noooo!

59
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,320
I will find Omi.

60
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,860
You! Find the rat who took
Gar's eye!

61
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,886
Omi!

62
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,910
Papa!

63
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,920
Omi.

64
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,416
Tak-Tek! Father!

65
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,940
Suta! We Go We GO!

66
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,426
Leave us alone!

67
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,926
Give up now termites!

68
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,950
Back to hell monster.

69
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,960
You! You hurt Gar!

70
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,346
Suta! Tak-Tek.

71
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,856
Mother! Mother!

72
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,380
Tak-Tek.

73
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,890
Mother! Mother! Suta!

74
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,386
We have to save mama!

75
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,410
One of her medicine stones.

76
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,896
She calls for us to go
after her.

77
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,420
We must help her papa.

78
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,930
She would do the same for us.

79
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,930
I must keep you safe.

80
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
We must go!

81
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,426
Those stones will not save you.

82
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,960
They are for Tak-Tek, he will
follow, I know he will.

83
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
I think we lost them.

84
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,437
Good.

85
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,970
Look for the next stone.

86
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,946
Another stone.

87
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,970
That's 7.

88
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,480
He's our village, and here is
where we found the new stone.

89
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,490
The stones are leading us there.

90
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,490
Those mountains, that is where
the rock men go.

91
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,500
We must cross the grasslands,
home of the giants.

92
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,476
The giants.

93
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,976
Yes, the home of the giants.

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,010
They are more dangerous than the rock
men. They both kill, but we have no choice.

95
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,520
Where are we?

96
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,540
Send them to the boiling room.

97
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Stop!

98
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,100
Poison trees.

99
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,110
Is there another way around?

100
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,586
No.

101
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,086
We must cover ourselves,
then we can run throught the bushes safely.

102
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,610
I'll build a decoy.

103
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,130
Another stone! Aaarrgg!

104
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,150
Now! Through the bushes.

105
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,150
There!

106
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,160
Aaargh.

107
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,136
What is this termiite trick?

108
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,646
You go through!

109
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,046
Vines very bad, you go first.

110
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,080
You are weak!

111
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,590
Gar! Get out!

112
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:02,090
Aaaaahhhh!

113
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,496
That will teach the rock men
Papa!

114
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Be humble Goben, earth made the
poison vines, not you.

115
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
C'mon.

116
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,006
I do not know these lands, some
plants are strange.

117
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,040
Look Papa!

118
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,526
These are not by rock men.

119
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,060
No, giants...

120
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
Omi!

121
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,100
This is a place of worship for
the Giants.

122
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
We must leave.

123
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,600
Leave it. It's not for us.

124
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,110
That could be changed.

125
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,610
See! Your arms are too small.

126
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,620
It needs the helping stick.

127
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,630
You see papa, earth mother
provides, I create.

128
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,106
Just like you.

129
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,130
Lets go.

130
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,650
My helping stick can be used for
many things. It can throw, it can lift,

131
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,636
and it can reach where a hand
cannot.

132
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,660
For tree people, our greatest
skill...

133
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,170
Is quiet!

134
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,670
Go! Go! Go!

135
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,167
Papa!

136
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,200
Stay down.

137
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Earth mother saves us.

138
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,710
They are giants.

139
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,696
But they look jusrt like us.

140
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,696
They are not like us, they kill,
they hunt animals to eat.

141
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,220
They think not of earth mother.

142
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,230
Look... how strong... they are.

143
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,740
We must ask them to help us.

144
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,740
Papa Please.

145
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,810
What intruders are these?

146
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,320
Speak children! Who are you?

147
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,320
We are not children.

148
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,340
You speak common tongue well,
half man.

149
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
We have watched your people and
listened.

150
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,816
We are tree people.

151
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,826
Tree-People? I thought they were
a myth.

152
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,826
I think not but clearly the
rumors are true that they can

153
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,350
blend into the grass
and become invisible.

154
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,850
Teach us how to become
invisible.

155
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,360
I will teach you how to take out
an eye.

156
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Goben No!

157
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,360
Hold your weapon Varm.

158
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,846
These half-men... and woman...
are not in a very good humor this day

159
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,370
and besides, THAT one saved my
life.

160
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,880
You have done me a great service
half-man. I am in your debt.

161
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,356
I am Amthar, master of the hunt. These
are my companions, Varman and Pesh.

162
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,890
I am Tak-Tek, these are my
children Omi and Goben.

163
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,366
How can I repay you?

164
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,390
Help us please.

165
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,377
Help you?

166
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:36,400
Our people were taken by
Rock-Men.

167
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,910
My mother was taken.

168
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,886
They are in those mountains,
please help us.

169
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,420
These half men seek a service from
me. Should I accommodate them?

170
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,920
What think you my friends?

171
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,920
As you said, you do owe him the
services.

172
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,930
My Cheif Korm is the ruler of
these lands.

173
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,406
HE must make the decision...
and as much as it pains me,

174
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,430
I must bring you before him
so he could answer your request.

175
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,486
My great cheif Korm.

176
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,020
What are these... Little
things... you bring before us?

177
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,496
These are half-men are jungle
people.

178
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,506
They saved my life and seek safe
passage through our land as repayment.

179
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,006
They wish to rescue their kin
from the clutches of the Rock men.

180
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,506
Rock men are an evil enemy. But we
have been at peace for many, many seasons.

181
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,016
We do not bother them and they
do not bother us.

182
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,516
Please let us pass, so we can
save our people.

183
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,050
Your kin are beyond hope. Leave
them to their deaths.

184
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,027
My great cheif...

185
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:07,026
You would speaak agaist your
kin?

186
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,036
I seek only to aid their quest
as repayment for my life debt.

187
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,536
So you may die as well? And
for strangers no less.

188
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,060
These strangers saved my life.

189
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,070
Varm and Pesh and I would gladly
join their fight.

190
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:29,046
A fight that is not ours. That
would start awar with the Rock-Men,

191
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,056
cost the lives of our finest
hunters...

192
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,556
Great Cheif...

193
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:41,090
Better the meat of half men than
stealing OUR babies for their cookpits.

194
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,090
We should do NOTHING!

195
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,090
We must do something!

196
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:59,576
I am your chief and I will NOT
allow it!

197
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,610
Great chief Kormm, what about a
trade.

198
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,496
What could you possibly have,
tree man, that I could want?

199
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,030
My daughter is a medicine woman,
she can teach you how to plant seed.

200
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,530
Onions Cabbage and rice.

201
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:29,016
What? Us? You would have us
eat plants?

202
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,516
We are humans, rulers of the
plains!

203
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,516
There are plenty of animals for
all eternity.

204
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,026
I have no interested in your
seeds.

205
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,526
I have other tools for digging
and cracking nuts!

206
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,536
Maybe there is a tool to make
you taller.

207
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,536
Let the half-man speak!

208
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,060
Make him show us something we
can use.

209
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
Papa!

210
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,046
Wait, one more, my son goben,
can help you throw your spears far.

211
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,070
Now this I would like to see.

212
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,570
It is true, with my helping
stick, you will throw one far.

213
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Alright then, Show me.

214
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,556
Who is your best spear thrower?

215
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,080
Amthar.

216
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,590
Stand aside. This will be a
mighty toss.

217
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,596
Indeed that is a mighty toss. But let
not a man, even the best among us,

218
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,130
claim to do what THIS woman does
better.

219
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,616
Who is not as good?

220
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,126
Varm, your little brother Pesh is
right for that. If he has the strength.

221
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,626
Give him your smallest spear.

222
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,660
Pesh gets a child's spear.

223
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,656
Don't make a fool of me half
man.

224
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I will not pesh, let the helping
stick do the work.

225
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
A trade for safe passage please?

226
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,716
It is a mighty gift.

227
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,226
And we could make more, to aid
us in both battle and hunt.

228
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,726
A true king would do this right
thing.

229
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,726
And what do you know
of true kingship,

230
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,236
one who could help... little
people with useless toys.

231
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,736
What?

232
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I will not start a war Rock-Men and
waste our human blood for tree people.

233
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,270
Don't think to disobey me
Amthar.

234
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,256
This is not honorable.

235
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,256
Honorable... no, perhaps not.
But practical.

236
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,790
Bind the half men, we will leave them for the
Rock men to find when we leave in the morning.

237
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,820
What is going to happen?

238
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,796
Do what they say and live.

239
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,320
Boiling room.

240
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,806
Boiling room.

241
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,330
No, no, no, no!

242
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,840
Boiling room.

243
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,870
You are a healer.

244
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,847
Yes.

245
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:06,346
I'm am Koto.

246
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:13,880
Slave to Rock-men a long time.
But Koto still alive.

247
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Move Termites!

248
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,890
Let me take this termite.

249
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,300
Yes. Take her. Enjoy her...
hahaha.

250
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,276
Stay with Koto.

251
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,310
I teach you how not to die.

252
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,296
The rope is so tight.

253
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,796
Keep trying!

254
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,797
Suta is dead.

255
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,796
No papa, she lives.

256
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,830
My hand is almost free.

257
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,307
Amthar?

258
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,306
Sssshhhh... Don't be afraid.

259
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,330
Please let my children go.

260
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,316
I will do better than
that. You saved my life.

261
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,840
And I believe that one
should always pay their debts.

262
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,826
Amthar, Thank you.

263
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,827
Thank you.

264
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:23,360
GO! GO! GO!

265
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,370
Laylan?

266
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Be glad little half-men. We will
help you find your kin.

267
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,380
Varm and Pesh?

268
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
They await ahead.

269
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,400
Well met Amthar. We are ready.

270
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Quickly, into the jungle to the
mountain of the Rock-Men.

271
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,410
And let swiftness guide our
feet.

272
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,406
We should be there in a day.

273
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:38,430
Good. Rock-Men do not keep their
prisoners for long.

274
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,436
Caution is for the weak, yes
brother?

275
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Only for those with slow feet!

276
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,970
One day, Pesh will beat Varm.
Brothers will be brothers.

277
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,947
Father?

278
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:23,456
I am ok I will catch up.

279
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,456
No we must not lose you too.

280
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,980
Can yo walk?

281
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,956
He will with our help yes.

282
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,990
You have your mothers strength.

283
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,510
Come Half-men.

284
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,996
My kinsmen will be moving swiftly!
You tarry too long at each obstacle.

285
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:12,020
And you move too fast, you feet will
find what your eyes should see first.

286
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,507
Come.

287
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:18,530
Give us time, to rest.

288
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,530
Each moment here is a moment
lost.

289
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,040
The jungle up ahead is thick. I have
never seen anything like it before.

290
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,026
Can you guide us through them?

291
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,550
Yes, remember we have short
legs.

292
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,046
I think I would have lost the
half-men.

293
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,670
They are not lost. They know
this forest better than we ever will.

294
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,230
They are probably swinging
through the trees right now.

295
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,100
Help!

296
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,610
What jungle hell is this?

297
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,110
Cut the Vine!

298
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,996
No worry bother, I got you!

299
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Help!

300
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Hang on!

301
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,530
Aaahhh!

302
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
Laylan!

303
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,910
A Noskaj!

304
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,920
We can't cut the Vine!

305
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,396
Get me kokat balm. Omi Quick!

306
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
Yes Papa.

307
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,940
Laylan the children!

308
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,440
Almost there!

309
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Almost!

310
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,510
Amthar, let me lead.

311
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,006
This will help.

312
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,006
It's already better.

313
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,506
Thank You. Omi

314
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,040
you are helping us, thank you
laylan.

315
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,516
I've never told anyone about
this before...

316
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:23,026
On a night before the full moon
much like tonight, when I was a child,

317
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,560
the Rock-Men took my mother and
my brother from our village.

318
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,560
And they took their lives under
the full moon.

319
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:46,570
Now, I thirst for a vengeance that only the
last drop of the Rock-Men's blood will quench.

320
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:55,580
And With the Sky Father's help,
I intend to take that blood.

321
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,566
With the earth mothers healing,
it will be easier if you can see.

322
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,590
Thank you.
She will not be blind for long.

323
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Please do not let my injury keep you from
your quick ascent. Tonight is the full moon.

324
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,086
Full moon?

325
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:24,086
Yes. We hurry because full moon is
the time of feasting for the Rock-Men.

326
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,620
That is why they took your
people, Tak-Tek, your wife.

327
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,620
By tonight, every one of them
will slaughtered.

328
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,140
Bow, bow your head.

329
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,117
Thank you.

330
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:57,626
The full moon is tonight.

331
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,626
That is why you are here.

332
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,126
To worship the moon?

333
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,650
No, to be cooked for the feast!

334
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,136
Suta, its me Kaylay. Goben's
friend.

335
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,636
Yes I know you.

336
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Gelling is hurt. Please help
him.

337
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,670
No talk!

338
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,180
Geling, its me suta.

339
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,666
Does Goben live?

340
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,667
He does.

341
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:47,676
Good... when may I see him?

342
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Eat this, it will give you
strength.

343
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,200
Tak-tek must get here soon.

344
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,720
The Rock men were here recently.
The fire is fresh.

345
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,696
They leave a foul stench.

346
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,196
I wish I could see more clearly.

347
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,230
You would not like what we see.

348
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,216
Kam-Chee, he was a gardener.

349
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,240
The rock men are beasts.

350
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,740
Earth mother, watch over your
sleeping child.

351
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,237
LayLan!

352
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,770
Wait here!

353
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:09,270
[{Groans]

354
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,276
I could have killed him, but I
though he might be useful.

355
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,776
Keep him away from me.

356
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,810
Where are the rest of the tree
people?

357
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,820
Do the tree-people still live?
Are they at the mountain?

358
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,330
There is no peace for beast men.

359
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,307
This is crazy!

360
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:07,330
Do not fear half man. I will
protect you.

361
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,350
No... NO!

362
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,380
Watch over pesh earth mother.

363
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:13,890
Sky father and earth monther. Look over
young Pesh. We may all join him soon enough.

364
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,980
You eat now.

365
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,966
No Raykah! It's flesh!

366
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,966
I know. I'm hungry. We must eat.

367
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,490
Where do you think that's from?

368
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:02,886
Suta! Something has happened.
Rock-men chase tree people in jungle.

369
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,920
They are very angry Come with
me!

370
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,920
Go ahead Suta. Go. I will stay.

371
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,406
We found them, then they got
away.

372
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,440
Idiot! Aaarrgg!

373
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:34,440
He chased tree people. They got
away. They were following magic rocks.

374
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,450
Tak-tek!

375
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,426
Idiots! All Idiots!

376
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:47,460
The rocks lead to here. Javas
are very angry. This is not good.

377
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,970
Think you... saved. Never!

378
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,970
NEVER!

379
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:13,480
Poisonous Komodos. See the red stripe
upon their backs? These beasts have venom.

380
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,966
I have nothing more to fear.

381
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,966
Nor I. But what good comes to
perish in this battle and

382
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,750
leave the little ones to
fend for themselves?

383
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,000
I would rather die with a pile of ROCK MEN
corpses at my feet than these wretched lizards.

384
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,010
They may not sleep long. We
must hurry.

385
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:46,020
Laylan, Varm, take one of the
little ones each, I will protect Omi.

386
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,590
Are you hurt... little one?

387
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,590
No are you?

388
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,566
We must find your father.

389
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,090
You've been bitten.

390
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,100
It is not... so deep.

391
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,600
The poison has to come out.

392
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,100
You must... save... your family.

393
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,610
Amthar. Are you OK?

394
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,620
I will be fine.

395
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,096
Keep Awake. Omi, Can your
medicine save him?

396
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,596
Yes.

397
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,120
Then we must find somewhere
safe.

398
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,640
We must find safety.

399
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,650
I must find suta.

400
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,650
Papa, we are so close to the
lair.

401
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:05,660
Goben, I must go alone, stay
with your sister.

402
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,210
He has the fever, do you know
bram-fruit leaves?

403
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,710
Yes.

404
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:00,710
Get some, make tea, and I need a
hot stone.

405
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,210
I will make a fire with no
smoke.

406
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,230
I... I am... sorry.

407
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,730
SSHHHH we will care for you.

408
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,250
Suta!

409
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,260
I cannot let you go alone papa.

410
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,260
My son my couragous son!

411
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,780
Raykah, we must find another
way!

412
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,810
I shall go ahead. Stay here and
draw the map as I whistle directions.

413
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,310
Yes Papa.

414
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,360
Good Son, Good.

415
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,857
They are going to eat us.

416
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,356
Sssshhh!

417
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,856
They are going to eat us.
They are going to eat us.

418
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,856
Do not lose hope!

419
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,356
There is no hope!

420
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:59,890
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

421
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,910
Stupid pet.

422
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,420
Give her to the moon god now!

423
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,430
Raykah no!

424
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:38,930
Nnnnnoo... nnoo!

425
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,440
No! Let go! Let go!

426
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,440
Gorram!

427
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:01,950
Down! Down Termite.

428
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,970
Moon God, accept this sacrifice.

429
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,500
Gorram!

430
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,507
Bak-Do.

431
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:25,516
Tek-Tek, you are alive.

432
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,016
Yes, bak-do, does suta live?

433
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,017
Not for long.

434
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:32,016
We need to set booby traps for
the rock men.

435
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,540
I understand.

436
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,070
You must stay awake Amthar.

437
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,070
I am fine. Truly.

438
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,080
Are the rocks ready?

439
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,080
Almost.

440
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,556
It is a claw from one of the
lizards. I have cleaned it.

441
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,090
Thank you.

442
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,590
I'm sorry This will hurt.

443
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,610
I'll go find Tak-Tek and Goben.

444
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:46,620
The poison sack is not broken.

445
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:59,630
The hour has come for tonight's
sacrifice.

446
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:11,116
The feast begins soon. They will
pick who will be eaten. It will not be me.

447
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Now we choose.

448
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,650
So it begins.

449
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,680
Stop!

450
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,210
Coconut Sheild.

451
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,716
Where's your father.

452
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,240
He's inside and the drums have
begun.

453
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,740
Come. We must get Varm to attack
this place with us.

454
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,217
Amthar?

455
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:56,726
He's no longer among us as a
warrior.

456
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,226
Is he?

457
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:05,236
He lives, but barely and cannot
fight. That makes the choices mine.

458
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,760
My father has found a secret
entrance, will it help?

459
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,760
Yes, indeed.

460
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,760
Come.

461
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,270
It is too deep, it will break.

462
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:28,280
How long... will I live...
if it breaks?

463
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,780
Ten minutes, one hour, not long.

464
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,790
Long enough... pull it out.

465
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,300
I must fight.

466
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,310
And die? No. Let Omi heal you.

467
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,796
There is a secret entrance.

468
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,320
My father saw it.

469
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,796
Has Amthar been revived?

470
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,230
No. It is just us.

471
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:18,206
Then we go alone. Before the full moon
is high and the captives are sacrificed.

472
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,706
What about my sister?

473
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:27,216
She stays. If Amthar revives then
he will take her home to our people.

474
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,240
Korm will let them live.

475
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,750
I am ready.

476
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,760
Goodbye, My great Warrior. You
will be always with me.

477
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:02,756
Earth mother will always be with
you Omi.

478
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,280
I will see you again Goben.

479
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:19,790
This cannot be my fate... to wait
an invalid while my tribe perishes.

480
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,276
Do not let this be my fate!

481
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,810
Do not...

482
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,326
This is not a secret entrance.

483
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,350
Its that way.

484
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,860
Goben, You are to take position
at the entrance.

485
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,360
Take all the Rock-men's eyes
with your rocks.

486
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,870
Varm and I will busy them with
carnage while your people escape.

487
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:40,346
As soon as we are cut down then
you must run with all that can escape.

488
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,356
You must run and hide.

489
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,380
What do you mean cut down?

490
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,390
I do not know that we will live.
Not without Amthars strength.

491
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:58,866
If I die splattered with the blood of
those who killed my mother and brother,

492
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,400
then I will die well.

493
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,900
Now gather rocks, brave Goben.

494
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:13,410
We shall meet again where Sky
Father and Earth Mother live together.

495
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,410
Let's go.

496
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,940
That is the last one.

497
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,916
Can you... reach it?

498
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,940
No I am sorry.

499
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,950
Sky father... give me strength.

500
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,970
It didn't break!

501
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,980
Let us save our families.

502
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,466
There are three entrance ways.

503
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,966
This one, the far side.

504
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:41,500
And the secret passage.

505
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,476
I go where the enemy is greatest. I
will kill as many as I can before I die...

506
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,976
and then maybe even a few more.

507
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,510
I attack from the other side.

508
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,010
Suta!

509
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,020
Tak-tek.

510
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,030
Grab them!

511
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:20,030
Take woman to death pit.

512
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,540
Suta! No!

513
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,016
Kill the pet!

514
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,550
No! No! No!!

515
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,036
How find this place?

516
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,560
Who with you?

517
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,560
You sacrifce!

518
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:01,080
Tak-tek.

519
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,110
Gorram!

520
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:53,630
Let the feast begin!

521
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:01,116
You and your people will all
die.

522
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,640
Not before you!

523
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,150
Amthar!

524
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,150
Human! Kill Him!

525
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,660
Now Tak-Tek, Save your wife!

526
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:35,146
Tak-tek help im trapped.

527
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,670
Tak tek!

528
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,680
Help me!

529
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,680
Tak-tek!

530
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,190
Suta! Suta!

531
01:09:53,690 --> 01:10:00,666
Tak-Tek, tak tek, im trapped,
down here!

532
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:01,700
Suta!

533
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,717
Die Human!

534
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,240
You die first Rock-men!

535
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,227
Amthar!

536
01:10:52,251 --> 01:10:54,250
Laylan! Lead the tree people
out.

537
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,300
Warriors, to your dragons!

538
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,350
Varm!

539
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:12,890
I'm here.

540
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,866
It is a good day to die.

541
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,390
We're not going to die.

542
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:55,930
Suta!

543
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,440
Suta!

544
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,417
Tak-Tek!

545
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,940
Suta I will find rope.

546
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,390

547
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,930

548
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,980

550
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,500
Amthar.

551
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,010
Earth mother has saved you.

552
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:54,010
Yes. Earth mother has saved me.

553
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,020
And you have saved me.

554
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,530
Omi, please help me to my chief.

555
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,460

557
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:52,957
Go to the sky father great chief,

559
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:29,570
Monther and brother, you have
been avenged.

560
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,566
Goben I will stay with the humans,
I will teach them to grow plant.

561
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:49,066
That's good news.

562
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,066
What are you making?

563
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,600
It is a tool for making music.

564
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:12,110
Ouch the point is sharp.

565
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:14,596
I pounded down a medicine stone.

566
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:17,120
You can come with us Goben.

567
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,116

friends to us forever!

568

569
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,126
My Omi will teach you people
well.

570
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:49,626
Where is Goben? He should be
with us here as well.

571
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,126
Goben!

572
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,650

573
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,680

Goben Treechild!

574
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,696
Goben, stay with Omi.

575
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,196
Mother?

576
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,720
It is where you belong!

577
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,197
But...

578
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:04,106
Your mother and I will be fine.

579
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:07,130

us.

580
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,140
There, it is settled.

581
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:32,136
May earth mother watch over you!

582
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:37,636
All hail the mighty tree people,
children of the earth mother,

583
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:42,646
Tak-descendants live
for ten thousand years.

584
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:45,146
And never be forgotten.

585
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:48,170
Hail, hail, hail.

586
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:54,180
This world is the Giant's now,
may they use it wisely.
