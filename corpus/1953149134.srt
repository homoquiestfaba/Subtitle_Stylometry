00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,259
Gomorrah! Gomorrah!

00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:13,141
Sodom! Sodom!

7
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,009
Come!

8
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:51,075
The people of Sodom!

9
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,050
People of Gomorrah!

10
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:02,320
'' And God said to Noah:

11
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,964
' I decided to give cable
of all the meat ...

12
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,532
because the Earth is full
the violence of men.

13
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:11,603
Behold I will perish
along with the Earth '.

14
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,178
Lot! Lot!

15
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:28,880
Noah!

16
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,543
What happened?

17
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,120
-A coward stabbed me back here.
-Back where?

18
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,587
I will not be able to sit down.

19
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,755
And you, Mica?

20
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:44,993
I'm finished, Noah!
That leaves me to death and darkness.

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,866
Don't step on a spectrum.
Throw me in the nearest trench!

22
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,128
-Over.
-But who won?

23
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:15,918
And who lost?

24
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,157
-Sodom! Sodom!
-We Will! Kill him!

25
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:23,132
Sodom! Sodom!

26
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:43,348
-Feels better, Lot?
-More happy!

27
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,850
We survived.

28
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,986
Come on, can beat!

29
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:57,802
Death is far!
I still have years ahead!

30
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,374
Celebrate Noah!
We're alive!

31
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:34,635
This is the best part of war!
Wine, women ...

32
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:37,333
-Shut up!
-... and music.

33
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,208
Dismiss the song
If you have enough women and wine!

34
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,649
It is not for the orgy?

35
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:49,054
This all disgusts me!
I just hope God understands ...

36
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:53,523
It is my duty as a citizen
help my hometown.

37
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:57,688
-That God is this?
-The God of us all.

38
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,568
Not the God of Sodom and Gomorrah.

39
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,904
No, unfortunately.

40
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,300
Where is he?
Where he lives?

41
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,976
For me, he is on Earth ...

42
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:17,413
at sea, in the air we breathe.
It is all around us, Lot.

43
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,118
Although no one can see it.

44
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:24,684
-Truth.
-Or hear it.

45
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,450
Maybe, Yes.

46
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,189
It is very convenient. As it came
to know that your God?

47
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,663
I do not know.

48
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,295
Noah ...

49
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:39,165
you are my oldest friend,
and I love him like a brother.

50
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:44,606
But is every day more strange.
So, comment that is crazy.

51
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:46,911
But you have a good heart.

52
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:50,116
I must warn his wife
You will arrive soon?

53
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:54,746
Yes, tell him that I needed to rest.
I'm hurt.

54
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,381
Know that always take
along with me.

55
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,720
It's better than having
that kiss her to leave.

56
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,727
You two are like cat and mouse.

57
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:14,634
Come with me.
Come with me.

58
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,439
Not joking!

59
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:20,644
-Take care, buddy.
-You too.

60
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:23,214
Wait! Wait for me!

61
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,511
Where it goes?
This is the best part of the war.

62
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:31,249
Makes it all worthwhile!
It is very weird.

63
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,425
He is the best man
you know.

64
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,122
Critique it again,
and I tear off your heart!

65
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,768
Can talk! Speak!

66
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:21,133
You're drunk again?

67
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:25,707
Beautiful killing!
Wanted to have participated.

68
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:28,780
Would have killed one or two, you can believe.

69
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,286
Now arrasaremos Gomorrah!

70
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,980
Save them.
They will make good slaves.

71
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:41,457
What a beautiful booty! Valuable!

72
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,138
Naama!

73
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,934
Are you okay?
Is injured?

74
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,773
I'm fine, honey.

75
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:37,415
We learned that won
a great battle.

76
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:40,679
We Won.

77
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,255
It was terrible?

78
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,982
Is a duty or not ...

79
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:49,128
I never do that. Swear.

80
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,959
Are you okay
that's what matters.

81
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:56,268
I'll call children.

82
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,099
Boys!
See who has arrived! Come!

83
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,038
-No!
-Father! How was it?

84
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:05,610
Daddy!

85
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,043
-Daddy!
-Fast!

86
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,581
-Brought us something?
-I missed.

87
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,549
-Father! How many killed?
-Cam.

88
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:16,245
How was it? Conte!

89
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,922
-Afraid?
-You danced and sang ...

90
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,617
... when he won, father?
-Must have killed hundreds!

91
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,297
-Not killed anyone.
-Brought us something?

92
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,398
A keepsake sword?

93
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,036
-Or the ear of an enemy?
-Or a nose?

94
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,728
Nobody has a nose of Gomorrah!
We would put on sideboard!

95
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,432
Boys, his father traveled a lot.
Is tired.

96
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:39,169
-Let him rest.
-Sure, MOM.

97
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,007
We'll talk later.

98
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,979
-Thank to back it.
-We Will.

99
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,447
Rest, dad.

100
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,587
Sleep well.

101
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,194
So much killing and destruction!

102
00:10:56,397 --> 00:11:01,357
They all think that is right.
Only I think is wrong?

103
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:04,638
No, you're not wrong.

104
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:09,368
Who said this?
Who said this?

105
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:13,343
I am the Lord God,
creator of heaven and Earth.

106
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,072
It's really the Lord God?

107
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:19,184
-IS IT?
-Yes. It's me, Noah.

108
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,981
But talks with my voice!

109
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:25,886
Of Course. I am the creator.
His voice is mine.

110
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:29,756
My voice is in everything.
Listen carefully.

111
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:35,493
We have little time. Humanity
became poor and forgotten how to listen.

112
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,933
Only you, Noah, remained
pure enough ...

113
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,506
Therefore, you can still hear me.
I want you to go ...

114
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:45,805
... to the top of Mount Veovis.
-Monte Veovis?

115
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,982
-Why?
-I'll be waiting for you ...

116
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:53,711
... on top of Mount Veovis.
-Can you explain to my wife ...

117
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,413
I follow Your orders?
I just got back, you know?

118
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,684
-She'll understand.
-But ...

119
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:05,355
Trust me, have faith. Because
you, Noah, was chosen by me.

120
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,796
I?

121
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:10,863
But, Sir ...

122
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:15,169
-Monte Veovis.
-Mr?

123
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,879
I talked with God.

124
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:29,682
Yes?

125
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:32,885
I talked with God,
and He answered me.

126
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,987
What he said?

127
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:43,402
Had me go up Mount Veovis
to speak with him again.

128
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,404
He sent, is it?

129
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:54,272
Naama ... God spoke to me.

130
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,507
It is true!

131
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,793
Still not told us about the war
and the killing, father.

132
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,027
As we boast?

133
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:19,672
Kill is not subject
to brag, son.

134
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:24,174
-Doesn't like to kill, father?
-The Lord God does not approve.

135
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:27,642
-But everyone kills.
-So he is bravo.

136
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,284
-He told you this, father?
-No, but I know.

137
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:34,477
-Knows a lot about God, isn't it?
-Almost nothing.

138
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,952
But I know more than the others.
We will work.

139
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,256
Should feel proud, father.

140
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,693
Remember the story of the boy who,
so proud ...

141
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:46,162
turned into a bee,
whizzing, whizzing ...

142
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:49,826
There I go!

143
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,937
Stops!

144
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,439
-Gotcha!
-Just.

145
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:58,510
Comes to play.
Let's get back to work.

146
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:08,854
-Noah, Lot's wife is here.
-Where is my husband?

147
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,115
He will return with the army.

148
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,622
Why not back with you?

149
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,456
He was injured.

150
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:22,261
Injured? Ah, '' injured ''!
I know, I know.

151
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:25,370
He invents all
not to go home.

152
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:29,374
When summoned the army,
He was the first to offer.

153
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,172
All it took was the official say:
'' We want you ''. And he said: '' Yes ''!

154
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,642
And ran out the door!

155
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:39,615
And I know very well that you
is the best friend of his ...

156
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,156
... and you guys are together!
-Does not need to be aggressive.

157
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:48,594
Aggressive?

158
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:52,493
I'm never aggressive!

159
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:57,934
I have strong temperament,
but I do not fight.

160
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:03,065
Mother, that is why Lot
don't want to go back?

161
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,774
Close your eyes!

162
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,681
I'll leave to the monte Veovis today.

163
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,790
And before I go,
sooner I come back.

164
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,761
Will not discuss?

165
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,629
When the subject is the Lord,
I decided not to discuss.

166
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:32,271
You always discusses.
Mr or non-Lord.

167
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,566
Yes. Because I love you.

168
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,582
Boys, come here!

169
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:52,449
I'll be out five days ago. Want
take care of his mother and they are good.

170
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,097
-In what order, father?
-Do both at the same time.

171
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,221
I'm breathless.
I ate too much.

172
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,393
Naama is good wife,
but a terrible Cook.

173
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,036
Unable to burn water.
Remember the pooch that she ate.

174
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,695
And not fled. Could barely walk!

175
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:47,575
But, even after so many years,
a look it me flood the soul!

176
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,254
Hello! Mr!

177
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:04,591
It's me, Noah. I arrived.

178
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,323
I am here!

179
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,166
Mr?

180
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,835
Mr?

181
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:17,372
I came from afar.

182
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,172
Noah? I am here.

183
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,872
-Mr.
-I'm here ...

184
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,144
patiently waiting.
As you said it would be.

185
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:31,381
Why asked me to come here?

186
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,153
I have shocking news for you.

187
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:39,423
Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed.

188
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,828
Sodom and Gomorrah?

189
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:44,697
By fire and brimstone ...

190
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:48,500
because they have become
an abomination.

191
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:53,408
My creation, Noah.
That I loved.

192
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,211
And all ...

193
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,911
will perish?

194
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,487
All ...

195
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,659
least you, Noah.
You must pick up your family ...

196
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,624
and out of Sodom immediately.

197
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,529
-But Sodom is our home!
-tap her right away!

198
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:19,338
But how will I know that the Lord
is who is telling it is?

199
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,203
Maybe it's too early
to ask you to have faith.

200
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,810
Need a sign, Noah?

201
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,311
Wouldn't hurt.

202
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:33,077
Get off the mountain.
Now. Now!

203
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,182
I'm going!

204
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:26,700
The signal was enough, Noah?

205
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:30,707
-Up too, Mr.
-Exit with his family from Sodom.

206
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,209
Fast, there is little time.

207
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:36,871
-There is no way to save it, Sir?
-Save it?

208
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:40,451
-Is my homeland.
-Nothing would give me more pleasure.

209
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:45,219
Could cite fifty people
well who live there?

210
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,916
Fifty?

211
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:50,822
Could be ten?

212
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:55,491
Very well. Get quote
ten Honorable people ...

213
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:58,330
Sodom is saved.

214
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,265
Thank You, Mr.

215
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,576
Beware!

216
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:10,542
See where pisa, Noah.

217
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,959
Fifty? Of Sodom?

218
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:25,529
Get lower to ten.

219
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,667
We need to make a list
ten Honorable people.

220
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:37,101
Well, Lot is a.

221
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:41,773
I wouldn't say that Lot is honored.

222
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,408
But he is a good friend.

223
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,213
And is cousin of your worthless
brother Obadia, then it is relative.

224
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:52,017
-Very far.
-And his wife?

225
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:56,355
She has a tongue so ferina
as your mood.

226
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:59,532
She is very spiteful.
I guess I never helped anyone.

227
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:02,133
But it is his wife.

228
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:06,363
-Okay, are two.
-Great.

229
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:09,401
And the ...

230
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,870
Nataniel?

231
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:19,246
That old goat sleeps with
very young! Very very young.

232
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:20,852
Better choose Jerome.

233
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,814
Jerome sleeps with boys.
And Jeremiah?

234
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:31,058
Jeremiah is sleeping
with the wife of Joshua.

235
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,327
Ah, no. You must know some
virtuous woman in Sodom.

236
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,934
Ah, Yes ...

237
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:41,765
Has the ...

238
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:46,273
Not. Ah, you have the ...

239
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,711
No, she ... She serves no purpose.

240
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:52,776
What about ...?

241
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:58,390
No, does not pay.

242
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:00,892
Sorry.

243
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:06,265
I Am Sorry,
I don't know any.

244
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:13,865
We both need to think.

246
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:18,541
We already have two to
to recommend to the Lord.

247
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:21,742
We need to find out eight more.

248
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,221
So, who do we have?

249
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,583
Lot and his wife.

250
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:35,819
So the Lord
Let me cite ten.

251
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,327
He knew that would not give, fifty
without cheating.

252
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:41,126
And if I trapaceasse,
He would know.

253
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:45,002
Bedtime, Naama.

254
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,073
Doesn't take too long, my well.

255
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:01,409
I found ten Honorable people
to quote, Lord, without cheating ...

256
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,316
except Lot and his wife.

257
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:07,050
And I am not happy with them.

258
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,251
So Sodom and Gomorrah
will end up?

259
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:11,363
They are already marked in my book.

260
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,863
You should start from tomorrow,
before noon ...

261
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:17,901
and neither do you, or your family
must look back.

262
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,835
-Why not, Sir?
-Will be tempted to come back ...

263
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,373
and to help those condemned to death.

264
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:26,671
lgnorem their cries for help.

265
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,041
Nothing can do for them.

266
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,819
-The city will be destroyed this evening.
-What?

267
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:39,014
You will be saved,
breaking with his wife.

268
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,921
-Do not want to leave.
-Don't look back.

269
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,187
-Noah? Who told you that?
-God.

270
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:45,330
-God ...
-There is no time to explain.

271
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:48,695
But I never lied to you.
Get out of here.

272
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:51,632
-Noah?
-And don't look back!

273
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:57,074
What that fool wanted?

274
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,487
What Noah came to do
here so early?

275
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:23,567
-He's my best friend!
-Why? I never understood that.

276
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,568
-Have nothing in common!
-Noah is my only friend ...

277
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,264
that is happy
Whenever I'm happy.

278
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,806
Your friend happy
threw me into a bucket of dye!

279
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,439
So what?

280
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:40,011
'' So what? ''
Is everything you know say?

281
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:43,483
So what?

282
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,358
I married you
because it was love at first sight.

283
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,758
If I looked right,
I would have fled running!

284
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,494
His problem was that you said
to be yourself!

285
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:59,701
-I will.
-Will? Going?

286
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:02,204
Great. Prior had already gone!

287
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:06,037
-Goes where?
-Noah spoke ...

288
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:08,908
that Sodom is destroyed
This night.

289
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:13,018
You can stay if you want.

290
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,278
I will though!

291
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:17,616
I get!

292
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,722
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye!

293
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:48,544
-We Will! Let's go!
-Skirt!

294
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:52,425
-What are you doing?
-Do not want us to steal!

295
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:56,027
-There is nothing of value.
-Who is to blame?

296
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,754
You're a do-it-all
that does nothing!

297
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,433
MOM said that you
was going to start at the bottom ...

298
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:04,570
... and down even more!
-His mother ...

299
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,040
has a mouth so large that account
secret in the ear!

300
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:11,506
The discussion is particularly
or open to everyone?

301
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,201
Where are you going?

302
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:18,507
My husband thinks that Sodom
will be destroyed tonight!

303
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:22,552
-You drank, Lot?
-Not. Lot only drink to calm down.

304
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:26,692
Sometimes, it is so quiet
that can't move.

305
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:30,886
Can mock ...

306
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,497
What a shame!

307
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,363
Be mocked
for people of this ilk!

308
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:43,133
I cannot more cycling head
erected in society! Never again!

309
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,777
Release me!
This is repulsive!

310
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:50,776
-Where we are going, Dad?
-I do not know.

311
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,049
Let's not get wandering
around without a home.

312
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:59,157
The Lord is our guiding star
and will show us the way.

313
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:13,730
It's almost time.

314
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,033
God will destroy everyone now?

315
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,301
Don't look back!
I do not look!

316
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,035
They will look, if not do something.

317
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,638
Sales!

318
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,790
Cam, come here.

319
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:42,228
-What will happen, MOM?
-I'm afraid.

320
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:44,528
-Me too.
-Hang on in cart.

321
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,431
steady.

322
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,603
Hang on in cart.

323
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,114
Why can't I look back?

324
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:12,254
Why can't I look back?
that is madness!

325
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:17,231
Not that I was seeing
our House here. It's so tiny!

326
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:21,806
Thanks to you, we went from obscurity
to oblivion!

327
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:25,205
I didn't know what it was happiness
until I marry you.

328
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,472
Now it's too late. Pronto.

329
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:31,013
You don't deserve it!

330
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:35,153
I had sweat malignant,
also without merit! Listen!

331
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:41,455
Learned to live one day at a time. AND
envision that today is a special day.

332
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:45,290
Hopefully. After so much effort!

333
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,716
It is now.

334
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:12,949
Cam?

335
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,653
Help, please!

336
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:53,031
Let's ride!
Is happening!

337
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,902
Is happening!
Exactly how Noah spoke!

338
00:29:58,104 --> 00:30:02,939
He hit, once in a lifetime!
I ask forgiveness! I Will Ask!

339
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,840
Will the South side of the city
is being destroyed?

340
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:13,041
Where are the wealthy houses?
They neither spoke with us!

341
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:17,189
Nose always prancing!
I need to look!

342
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,292
-Do not look!
-I need to see this, Lot!

343
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:25,396
All those people in snubbing!

344
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:30,194
Laughing hidden.
Mica and wife mocking us.

345
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:33,839
Now they are not mocking!
Are burning!

346
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,439
They are burning!

347
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:39,078
-I need to look!
-No!

348
00:30:39,345 --> 00:30:45,545
You never let me do anything.
I can never enjoy myself.

349
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:48,016
I want to have fun!

350
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:21,186
Ah, my dear ...

351
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:36,095
I warned you.

352
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:56,249
Continue pushing.
Continue!

353
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,552
Continue walking.

354
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:36,924
We are going to generate.
Lies between Kadesh and Shur.

355
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,564
And what we'll do there?

356
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:41,927
We are farmers.

357
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:44,399
What do you mean farm?

358
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:47,505
Anything.
We are in the hands of the Lord!

359
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:52,941
Lahey? Lahey? Why?
We are marketers.

360
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:56,206
What we understand of the plantation?
Goats and cabbages, that's all.

361
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,910
Generate!

362
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:05,541
Good day, friend.

363
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:09,452
-Came the Canyon?
-Come, friend.

364
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:13,492
You heard, Morab?
We may pass.

365
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,596
Don't shake your head at me.
We go to Sodom.

366
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,159
Our harvest
has been scarce here, friends.

367
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:25,599
Few farmers
they don't buy anything!

368
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,202
Now we will go to Sodom.
Is where the money is!

369
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,939
Sodom ended.

370
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:34,074
-Is destroyed. Dead.
-Became smoke.

371
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,115
Bang! Poof!

372
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:43,954
Life is full of sadness and pain.

373
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,050
Sometimes, I think ...

374
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:52,060
It was better not to have been born.

375
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:56,768
Ever met someone
lucky in life?

376
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,134
How it happened?

377
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:02,568
God destroyed them
because they were bad.

378
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:05,505
A religious issue?

379
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,245
that only confirms ... Do not stir
with religion. It's not worth it.

380
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,021
I always focused on ...
profit.

381
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,352
I believe ...

382
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:24,928
that all evil in the world
derives from the fact ...

383
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:30,194
God has not created money
enough, for starters.

384
00:35:32,638 --> 00:35:36,404
There is something pure and decent
in the money.

385
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:45,306
Well, but ...

386
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,850
would be interested
in something?

387
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:53,347
Everything your hearts and hands
wish! Ribbons, trinkets!

388
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,689
Pots, pans, toys!
Hats.

389
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,258
Hats for the family!
Hats!

390
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,766
-Boys!
-Makes a lot of heat in generate.

391
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:07,166
It doesn't rain for months.

392
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,968
Need hats
because of the Sun.

393
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:17,041
No, thank you.

394
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,611
Gorgeous.

395
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:40,200
-How beautiful!
It is here that God ...

396
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:45,275
... the Lord of the worlds, wants us to.
-Give me that! Is mine!

397
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:47,070
We will climb the mountain!

398
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:55,011
TEN YEARS DEPOlS ...

399
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,124
lmpossível create beauty
without good raw material.

400
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:09,527
They will make the cut.
Want to be beautiful.

401
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,856
Are very elegant, guys.

402
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:17,431
Care. No confusion.
Do not let the acuem.

403
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:20,128
Talk of neighbors,
not women.

404
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,773
-We don't want turmoil, father.
-Does not happen anything.

405
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:25,136
They fear us.
We are different.

406
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,868
And are the same.

407
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,180
Can go.

408
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,937
Is a temple to Mole,
the rain God.

409
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:59,169
These people have a God
for each thing.

410
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,342
And no successful.
Look at this.

411
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:06,017
Our God is different.
Unique. Only a God.

412
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,454
I think this makes it easier. Pray
for a God, instead of hundreds.

413
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,123
And of course top
This bunch of losers.

414
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:27,698
In fact, Noah,
everything is a miracle and a prodigy.

415
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:32,901
A miracle and a prodigy. You
always finds the right words.

416
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:38,583
And you think the words behind
of the words, the more blurred ...

417
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:41,810
and, behind them, the silence.

418
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:47,159
Is shaking, dear.

419
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,659
Is fear. Always fear by the boys
When they go to the village.

420
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:55,823
They are hated there. The staff
can do something against them.

421
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:58,469
Where is everyone?

422
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,579
The Ester ...?

423
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:35,540
-Who is it?
-Another person.

424
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,801
-Who is it?
-Is Without!

425
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:42,613
Don't get stopped there.
Between!

426
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:47,747
What's happening?

427
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,190
Ruth?

428
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:01,531
Ruth?

429
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:04,994
My little girl ...

430
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:08,673
What happened?
Where is Ruth?

431
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:11,968
-Where is Ruth?
-They took my daughter.

432
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:16,512
-Who?
-The priests of the temple.

433
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:19,440
Stay there.

434
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:22,143
Never again will I see it!

435
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,452
-There will be struggle.
-Need help.

436
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:27,821
-Call the father.
-I will not wait.

437
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,360
He will know that we need it.

438
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:36,364
Soft! Soft! Soft!

439
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,706
I forgot what we
make this night.

440
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:51,212
You will sacrifice a Virgin
for Mole, the rain God.

441
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:55,410
-For what?
-To have rain!

442
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:58,385
-He is gaga.
-We will have to elect another.

443
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:03,051
Rain?
Ah, Yes. Of course, rain!

444
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:06,521
This is not a small Ruth?
Why we euthanize it?

445
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,257
Was the only Virgin
We think that hurry!

446
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:12,767
-If there were more time ...
-Even so, it would be difficult.

447
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:15,440
-They go rare!
-But I know Ruth ...

448
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:18,007
Since she was little.

449
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,613
Sacrifice chickens, sheep,
Bulls, and it didn't work.

450
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:26,249
-Hello, Darling. How will your mother?
-Don't do it!

451
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:29,444
Want to be the first to choke you!

452
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:55,436
This young will kindly
sacrificing himself to save us.

453
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:00,350
With all reverence, we will
offer it to the great God Mole!

454
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:07,089
He rewards his followers
with the vital waters of the heavens!

455
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,221
-Sacrifice-in!
-Kill it!

456
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,402
Ruth!

457
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:30,981
Get It!
Come on, let's go!

458
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,342
Pick Up!

459
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,207
-Ruth?
-Kill the girl!

460
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:07,881
And others!
They are foreigners. And crazy!

461
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:10,851
And you're the craziest,
After his father.

462
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:15,586
As says this?
I'm courting his daughter Esther!

463
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:18,259
I'm your future son-in-law.

464
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:21,224
Dad?

465
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:22,491
Kill him!

466
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,068
Knock it off!

467
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,198
Since domei my hate,
I keep it saved.

468
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:32,134
But, when it is necessary, I use.

469
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:36,039
And I will use it now!
Drop them! Go away from here!

470
00:44:36,348 --> 00:44:40,216
-Or, what will you do?
-You came to take our land!

471
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:43,047
-And our women!
-Your crop grows, our no!

472
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:46,122
-He is a wizard!
-Kill it too.

473
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:47,792
And she!

474
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,955
Kill Noah!
He is just a man.

475
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,656
I have the Lord's army
by my side!

476
00:44:55,868 --> 00:44:58,769
-Is a lie!
-That good. Hold it!

477
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,365
Mr? It's your turn.

478
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,678
What the Lord has done with Sodom
and Gomorrah, he will be with you.

479
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:14,011
-Only worse.
-What would he do worse?

480
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:37,566
Not got me!

481
00:45:46,418 --> 00:45:48,511
Where is the light?
Where is the Moon?

482
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:54,616
What said?
Don't listen to anything. Nothing!

483
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,024
-Can't see!
-I'm deaf!

484
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,970
Why it took so much?

485
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:22,347
Noah, I have a task for you.
You build me an Ark.

486
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:24,988
-300 cubits in length.
-Build what?

487
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,991
-Wood.
-Wooden? I am not a constructor.

488
00:46:30,195 --> 00:46:33,858
You also not farmer
but thrived!

489
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:38,901
But 300 cubits in length
gives a 50 wide, and is very high!

490
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:42,904
I think big.
I made the world in six days.

491
00:46:43,108 --> 00:46:45,042
But how do I ...?

492
00:46:45,244 --> 00:46:48,042
Is seeing one branch there?

493
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:52,341
Yes, this same. Grab it.

494
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:56,387
Now draw.

495
00:47:18,744 --> 00:47:20,473
What is this?

496
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:23,307
-Something that I need to build.
-What?

497
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:26,040
-An Ark.
-A what?

498
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,878
An Ark.

499
00:47:28,086 --> 00:47:29,747
What is this?

500
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:31,946
Is a boat.

501
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:36,025
-For that you need a boat?
-Is for the Lord.

502
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:13,687
Mr?
We need to talk.

503
00:48:13,899 --> 00:48:16,959
Yes? I'm listening to.

504
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:21,765
-When you want the Ark ready?
-tap her right away. Or rather, up.

505
00:48:21,974 --> 00:48:26,536
My family and I cannot
do alone. We are only four.

506
00:48:26,745 --> 00:48:28,906
Stop drinking.

507
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,241
Will produce more.

508
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,509
Don't drink when I'm working.

509
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,778
Then hire helpers.

510
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:39,151
I tried. I tried.

511
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,350
All I think ...

512
00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:46,163
... crazy.
-Know.

513
00:48:47,332 --> 00:48:50,392
I'll have to help him again, Noah.

514
00:48:50,602 --> 00:48:55,301
We thank you. After All,
We are acting in good faith.

515
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:59,773
Without knowing what to do,
or why we do. Or not ...

516
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,606
Noah, you have been very clear.
Now go to sleep.

517
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,341
Will have a heavy day tomorrow.

518
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:09,213
Sure, Sir.

519
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:14,120
-Good night.
-Good evening, Noah.

520
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,757
Good night.

521
00:49:33,812 --> 00:49:36,645
You're snoring!

522
00:49:47,592 --> 00:49:49,958
How has this happened?

523
00:49:54,132 --> 00:49:55,531
Don't ask.

524
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:02,367
What are these numbers
and mysterious signs?

525
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:04,599
Is to help build the Ark.

526
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,478
-But what do they mean?
-We do not know the code.

527
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:13,346
I know. Know where each piece
wood fits.

528
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,383
When he learned this, father?

529
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:23,956
Last night. Muttered, he snorted,
muttered, he snorted, muttered ...

530
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:27,421
He was learning
How to build the Ark.

531
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:35,606
Hands to work.

532
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:35,799
We want food.

533
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:39,732
Japheth? Take the bread.
We give what we have.

534
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:42,634
-Want more.
-Don't even know how much give.

535
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:43,830
How do you want more?

536
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:47,439
-We always want more.
-Noah!

537
00:51:49,214 --> 00:51:50,203
Noah!

538
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,217
Doesn't recognize me? I'm A Lot.

539
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,086
-Your old friend! Of Sodom.
-Lot! Lot! Mother is the Lot!

540
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,625
Nunca te thanked
for having saved me.

541
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,263
Hello, Lot.

542
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:11,196
-Where is your wife?
-Dead, deceased, was already.

543
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:13,530
-I'm sorry.
-The world is like that.

544
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:15,603
What happened to her?

545
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:19,538
She always found the salt of the Earth,
and finally it happened.

546
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:23,737
She became a statue
of salt. Look at her finger.

547
00:52:27,118 --> 00:52:31,521
What are we waiting for?
Let's steal everything, kill them ...

548
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:34,248
raping women.
Or vice versa.

549
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,619
-You will die trying.
-So what?

550
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:41,560
-Cannot be worse than living.
-Rufus, they are my friends.

551
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:44,098
If you have disgust,
We kill for you.

552
00:52:44,302 --> 00:52:47,430
No, Rufus,
I don't care about killing.

553
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:55,339
This I did not expect.

554
00:52:56,081 --> 00:53:00,142
I was mistaken.
You caught me off guard.

555
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:03,747
I want to tell you something
on my last breath.

556
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:06,048
-What is it?
-É...

557
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:08,658
-What?
-É...

558
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,356
-É...
-Yes?

559
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,135
You took too long, Rufus.
Carry-in, guys.

560
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:21,203
The boots are mine.

561
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:26,933
Lot?

562
00:53:27,145 --> 00:53:29,579
Why become
a killer?

563
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:30,941
For a living.

564
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:33,049
The Lord has saved you
instead of others.

565
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,343
Thank you, Noah.

566
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:36,248
Yes, He saved me.

567
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:40,117
But I got no job, money.
It would be better I have died in Sodom!

568
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:44,125
Because being poor is like being dead,
just that you breathe.

569
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:50,529
Not. I tried to take a correct life,
but I was starving.

570
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:53,966
And, like everyone else,
disgusted by being poor.

571
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:57,835
You were a decent man.
If is now so ...

572
00:53:58,043 --> 00:54:00,603
and the rest of humanity?

573
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:03,938
Or want to know.

574
00:54:04,182 --> 00:54:08,812
You are the only decent man
I found that is going well.

575
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:14,281
The world is beautiful, Noah,
When we continue good.

576
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:17,518
But nobody can.

577
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:19,794
And see just how much gloom.

578
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:25,327
Making a new House?

579
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,032
Is an Ark.

580
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:33,802
-A boat.
-Boat?

581
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:36,377
-The Lord.
-The Lord.

582
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,581
All call you crazy
because the hear. But I know.

583
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:44,118
You are the only man are
What remained. Know ...

584
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,281
I also would love it if It
do not make the rules so strict!

585
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,327
I confirm.
He is really Almighty!

586
00:54:55,934 --> 00:54:59,267
Right, let's get ready.
Let's go!

587
00:54:59,471 --> 00:55:03,669
Mount! Prepare! Naama!

588
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:08,839
Shem, Ham, Japheth!
Good luck. Noah?

589
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:12,881
It was good to review it. The next
time to talk with the Lord ...

590
00:55:13,084 --> 00:55:15,746
Thank you for saving me. AND ...

591
00:55:15,954 --> 00:55:18,946
say that I regret not having been
worthy of salvation.

592
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,222
We will though.
Let's go. Let's go.

593
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:10,268
Wake Up, Noah. You are
sleepwalker. Yes, there she is.

594
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:12,802
Saw?

595
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:17,038
Admire. The Ark.

596
00:56:20,151 --> 00:56:23,245
-The Lord is over!
-Yes.

597
00:56:23,455 --> 00:56:26,856
-The time has come.
-What, Sir?

598
00:56:27,058 --> 00:56:31,654
Sodom and Gomorrah was an alert,
but they haven't changed.

599
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:35,026
Now, instead of fire and brimstone ...

600
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:41,502
afogarei the world in my tears.
Weep for 40 days and 40 nights.

601
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:47,235
I will flood the world,
and nothing will survive!

602
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,775
Oh, no ...

603
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:55,581
Mr?

604
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,756
I do not understand.

605
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:03,490
Why when we created
left us free to Sin?

606
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:06,061
It was some big mistake?

607
00:57:06,264 --> 00:57:11,463
I had hope. I found that
see the difference between good and evil ...

608
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:14,331
and choose wisely!

609
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:20,173
I expected it to turn
a nation of prophets.

610
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:24,644
Pity, Mr.
Give another chance to mankind.

611
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:28,080
She does not deserve to be swept
from the face of the Earth.

612
00:57:28,286 --> 00:57:30,777
Whatever they did ...

613
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:35,591
The sins of mankind
are too big.

614
00:57:35,794 --> 00:57:39,594
-There is nothing ...?
-They started to hate.

615
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:45,464
And now they all hate.
Are destroying the world again.

616
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,664
I'll finish with everything
and start again.

617
00:58:12,564 --> 00:58:15,658
The Lord did not finish
the service, father.

618
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:18,425
There is no rudder.

619
00:58:20,605 --> 00:58:25,508
Every boat has to have
a rudder, isn't it?

620
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,837
God said that the Ark
should not have.

621
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:33,507
He wants to guide us on the waters.
Let's wander ... here and there.

622
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:36,819
Here and there.

623
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:39,786
Heard, manos?

624
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:41,856
We'll wander
here and there.

625
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:44,285
Here and there!

626
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,860
Here and there?

627
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:49,266
No joke.
Get back to work.

628
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:54,868
-Dad, why the Ark is so great?
-We'll have company.

629
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,207
Animals Creepers.

630
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:00,801
Someone we know?

631
00:59:02,614 --> 00:59:05,913
Animals. Many animals.

632
00:59:07,385 --> 00:59:10,047
God is choosing them now.

633
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:15,123
What a beautiful dirt they'll do!

634
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:18,652
Who will catch everything?

635
00:59:19,163 --> 00:59:23,156
Certainly, you have not thought
about it when he had this idea!

636
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:28,896
It picks a couple of each
species. They are already on the way.

637
01:01:09,405 --> 01:01:13,307
Noah, the end of the world
starts tomorrow.

638
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:19,175
I inundarei the whole earth,
washing the sins forever.

639
01:01:19,381 --> 01:01:22,782
Was Noah who did stop raining!

640
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:26,212
And it was Noah who brought the animals!

641
01:01:28,524 --> 01:01:32,790
Kills! Kills! Kills! Kills!

642
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:41,031
Who brought all this?

643
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,467
The dad must have spoken
'' up there ''.

644
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:48,835
He lives saying
that the Lord will provide.

645
01:01:52,615 --> 01:01:55,516
I see that he also
provided the shovels.

646
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,521
Noah! Noah! Let's kill him!

647
01:02:04,493 --> 01:02:07,018
We'll kill him!

648
01:02:09,031 --> 01:02:11,397
Kill him!

649
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,868
Cam! No, where is the father?

650
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:18,465
Father?

651
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:46,098
-I know! Noah is behind this!
-Kill him!

652
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:49,570
-What's the problem?
-Their animals have passed through the village!

653
01:02:49,772 --> 01:02:53,708
They have not gone '' by '',
they spent '' about ''.

654
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:57,406
We regret.
My husband will speak with them.

655
01:02:57,613 --> 01:03:01,743
They trampled everything,
and we pisotearemos you!

656
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:15,021
Ora! Who's afraid
a tiger a rod?

657
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:20,526
But two lions sarnentos?

658
01:03:32,648 --> 01:03:34,707
It is not fair to bring
the animals here ...

659
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:37,044
destroying our homes,
fields and crops!

660
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:39,277
-That the plantation?
-I do not understand.

661
01:03:39,488 --> 01:03:42,753
-What these critters are here?
-They go to the Ark.

662
01:03:44,026 --> 01:03:46,893
Are all madmen!
The animals too!

663
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:49,460
They know that they will be saved
When the rain comes.

664
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:55,527
That rain? It doesn't rain for years!

665
01:03:56,071 --> 01:03:58,232
Where's the rain?
Where's the rain?

666
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,739
Where's the rain?
Where's the rain?

667
01:04:02,077 --> 01:04:06,810
-She's coming.
-There is not a cloud!

668
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:10,314
Where's the rain?
Where's the rain?

669
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:11,747
Where's the rain?

670
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:33,100
She didn't wet!
She burns like fire!

671
01:04:37,346 --> 01:04:39,644
Is burning me!

672
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:50,622
She burns ...

673
01:04:54,229 --> 01:04:57,062
Is burning me!

674
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:41,972
Noah? When God makes it rain,
as he knows how much should last?

675
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:45,507
He knows.
It will last for 40 days and 40 nights.

676
01:05:45,714 --> 01:05:47,648
So, we need to
be ready to leave.

677
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:50,978
Think '' sail ''
is the expression.

678
01:05:51,186 --> 01:05:53,416
Let's take someone more, father?

679
01:05:53,622 --> 01:05:55,351
I spoke with the Lord ...

680
01:05:55,557 --> 01:05:58,117
and we'll only take
Thompson, Ruth and Esther.

681
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:01,453
-Nobody else!
-I liked it!

682
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:41,897
-Fast! Pick up girls!
-Hurry! Let's go!

683
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:22,668
-I will not without my mother!
-I wanted to, but my dad said no.

684
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:24,573
Damn you your father and you!

685
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,307
-We go from now!
-I'll stay!

686
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:34,182
-Take it, Cam!
-I won't!

687
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:45,198
Anda!

688
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,425
Fast!

689
01:07:47,703 --> 01:07:50,399
What happened?

690
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,132
What happened to you?

691
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:56,945
Without! Without!

692
01:07:57,446 --> 01:08:00,210
Help me!

693
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:04,382
Ruth! Ruth!

694
01:08:04,586 --> 01:08:08,181
Let's lift. Lift!

695
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:11,351
Hold it.

696
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,152
-Can leave.
-You are late!

697
01:08:13,362 --> 01:08:15,353
I know.

698
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:22,495
Raise the ramp, guys!

699
01:08:54,636 --> 01:08:57,537
Lord, is this the end?

700
01:08:57,739 --> 01:08:59,229
Is not even the beginning of the end.

701
01:08:59,441 --> 01:09:02,877
For more that has learned,
This is still the first page!

702
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:06,878
The flood is not yet strong
enough to flood the world ...

703
01:09:07,082 --> 01:09:11,246
and do you see the strength
God Almighty!

704
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,971
Drug!

705
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:33,040
No More!

706
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:43,755
Japheth always had problem
with the work.

707
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,860
How does not work,
He does not know when to stop.

708
01:09:46,763 --> 01:09:49,698
Japheth! Come here to help us.

709
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:53,702
Let's go!

710
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:59,499
-I hate dirty work.
-Is, and this is dirty.

711
01:09:59,709 --> 01:10:02,473
It was for this that the Lord
saved us?

712
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:04,911
Clean?

713
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:10,075
I got scared.

714
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:12,948
With the door locked,
could not enter.

715
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:16,184
Not?

716
01:10:16,593 --> 01:10:19,426
I speak of the storm.

717
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:38,670
-Where the girls are?
-Cooking.

718
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:39,905
As they passed the night?

719
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:45,381
No I thought comfort
Ruth last night.

720
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:49,691
I thought the same about Mani,
but the door was locked.

721
01:10:50,259 --> 01:10:52,693
The work of father.

722
01:10:58,101 --> 01:11:00,467
Hello, Ginger.

723
01:11:02,105 --> 01:11:04,369
Hello.

724
01:11:16,786 --> 01:11:20,586
-Find me on deck tonight.
-His father was not going to like it.

725
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:23,589
If he doesn't know,
will not be hurt.

726
01:11:23,793 --> 01:11:27,320
He would not like, nor do I!

727
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:30,829
No!

728
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:37,897
And the Fox lay down
with the lamb.

729
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:43,103
Hopefully she doesn't want to
Lamb for dinner.

730
01:11:43,513 --> 01:11:47,347
See how are affectionate
with one another.

731
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:03,731
Why God does not make another land,
with other people ...

732
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:07,568
If he does not like this?

733
01:12:11,274 --> 01:12:13,606
If we had hair ...

734
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:16,938
as the critters,
instead of skin ...

735
01:12:18,381 --> 01:12:21,509
... wouldn't have to wear clothes.
-Wouldn't have to wear clothes.

736
01:12:23,786 --> 01:12:26,550
Hello!

737
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:30,619
Father! Mom!

738
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:33,261
-Hello!
-Hello.

739
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:36,096
-Ruth!
-Hello!

740
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:37,357
-Hello!
-Hello!

741
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:40,297
-Hello!
-Hello!

742
01:12:41,604 --> 01:12:43,765
What a beautiful boat that yours!

743
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:48,272
Yes, Yes. He is.

744
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:54,609
Need something?
Pots, pans, knives sharp.

745
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:59,220
Dresses for the ladies.
And has the offer of the week ...

746
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:01,947
The Wonderful Elixir Marigold.

747
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:03,989
We have already seen before, Muscat!

748
01:13:04,961 --> 01:13:07,395
-Already?
-We met.

749
01:13:07,597 --> 01:13:12,364
And we bought Cookware.
And hats. Remember?

750
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:16,433
Hats.
For the whole family.

751
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:20,107
Ora! Another satisfied customer.

752
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,776
With me, your money
will always be well spent ...

753
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,915
my products have
lifetime warranty.

754
01:13:27,116 --> 01:13:32,076
I will ascend the Board, if you will allow me.
Only for the purpose of Exchange.

755
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:35,485
Stay where you are.
We'll go down.

756
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:41,790
Give It A Try.

757
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:45,765
A SIP, and become
in a new man.

758
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:48,402
Maybe two new men.

759
01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:52,336
-Good, huh!
-Smooth.

760
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:54,567
IS ...

761
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:56,768
strictly medicinal?

762
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,472
Oh, of course!
Strictly, no doubt!

763
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:05,581
Go by me:
take a couple of boxes.

764
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:12,694
What I would like in return?
We don't have any money.

765
01:14:12,895 --> 01:14:15,125
No one has. Is useless.

766
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:18,528
This shows the State they arrived
things currently.

767
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:22,295
The money lost its value.
Is horrible. Horrible.

768
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:26,437
Before, the money
define who we were.

769
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:30,568
I was ...
I was a merchant.

770
01:14:31,414 --> 01:14:36,681
Now do I ... bartering.
Change one thing for another.

771
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:41,819
-That decadence!
-What do you want in place of money?

772
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:44,854
Food! Water!

773
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:50,021
Has a lot of water out there,
only that is getting salty.

774
01:14:50,466 --> 01:14:53,162
Food and drinking water.

775
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:55,926
Closed.

776
01:15:07,617 --> 01:15:10,518
Percy, for you have nothing!

777
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:16,115
I'll find one thing
for our little friend.

778
01:15:21,731 --> 01:15:23,198
Very well.

779
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:26,698
-Picked up everything?
-Already got everything?

780
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:29,030
Careful not to fall into the water.

781
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:31,070
Goodbye.

782
01:15:31,274 --> 01:15:33,174
-Thanks, Muscat.
-Take care!

783
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:34,809
-Up to see.
-Right!

784
01:15:35,011 --> 01:15:38,447
-Goodbye.
-Good sales!

785
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,613
Take care!

786
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:46,983
-Goodbye!
-Thank you.

787
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:49,589
Goodbye!

788
01:16:05,508 --> 01:16:08,568
We will have difficulty
to keep them at Bay.

789
01:16:09,478 --> 01:16:11,673
Is natural.

790
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:15,373
Natural or not, God imposed
certain rules for this trip.

791
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:18,712
One of them is: no sex
or procreation ...

792
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:21,651
among animals or humans.

793
01:16:23,426 --> 01:16:25,291
As we go
control animals?

794
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:30,259
We do not need. God took care of that,
eliminating the instinct of them.

795
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:34,893
And our instincts?

796
01:16:35,538 --> 01:16:37,836
We'll have to control them ...

797
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:40,705
by the way.

798
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,676
God created us, then he should
know that it will not be easy.

799
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:47,640
We have to take care of them,
Dear.

800
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,418
Of the boys?

801
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:52,416
But ...

802
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:55,590
and we? How are ...

803
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:58,954
How are our instincts?

804
01:16:59,595 --> 01:17:02,758
We are mature enough to
control them when necessary.

805
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:06,593
And I think it will be.

806
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:15,176
-What are you drinking?
-Wonderful Elixir Marigold.

807
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,448
Strictly medicinal.

808
01:17:23,853 --> 01:17:26,617
This trip will be long?

809
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:28,218
Too long.

810
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:31,221
Wow life!

811
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:13,392
Attack!

812
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:17,467
-Why the rush?
-It took my daughter.

813
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:22,669
She is all I have in the world
now that his holy mother is gone!

814
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:25,471
Moreover, look at the size of it!

815
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:29,913
With this boat, we will dominate
the rest of the world! Attack!

816
01:18:30,386 --> 01:18:32,513
The captain will not like.

817
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:37,021
I don't care what that
Junk of people like!

818
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:40,559
-Leave it to me!
-Call the captain!

819
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:45,065
Attack!

820
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:53,705
Prepare yourselves!

821
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:55,501
Maybe they are peaceful.

822
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:12,023
Kill him!
Kill it already!

823
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:24,968
Stop it!

824
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:36,779
I always took it all!

825
01:19:38,521 --> 01:19:41,490
This I could have won!

826
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,784
Attack.

827
01:19:45,995 --> 01:19:48,088
Attack ...

828
01:19:59,642 --> 01:20:02,133
It Takes!

829
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,550
What they want?

830
01:20:18,194 --> 01:20:21,630
Noah! Is Lot!
His old friend Lot!

831
01:20:22,298 --> 01:20:25,859
-Lot?
-He joined the rabble.

832
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:27,567
Naama is talking bad about me?

833
01:20:29,405 --> 01:20:30,463
More or less.

834
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,405
She nailed it! I progressed
a lot since Sodom.

835
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:38,205
Was a total decay,
and I loved every minute!

836
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:43,084
I'll take your boat, Noah.

837
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,917
Why?

838
01:20:46,188 --> 01:20:50,090
So when you ask me
What did the flood, I will say:

839
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,783
'' I survived! ''

840
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:58,031
This boat is ours!

841
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:03,070
It belongs to the village!
You stole.

842
01:21:03,272 --> 01:21:06,639
-We build!
-Truth! We build.

843
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:11,005
-And he stole!
-Your thief!

844
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:16,313
Surrender yourself, Noah, and nobody
will hurt, I promise.

845
01:21:16,518 --> 01:21:18,850
The Lord will not allow.

846
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,385
So risk, old friend.

847
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,384
In that case ...

848
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:26,891
do your worst.

849
01:21:29,064 --> 01:21:30,861
Take the boat!

850
01:22:26,322 --> 01:22:29,223
Leave the front! Outside!

851
01:22:30,292 --> 01:22:33,352
Give me that! Get Out!

852
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:50,441
Climb here!

853
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,204
Take all! Pick Up!

854
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:59,677
What is shooting?

855
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:03,621
The buns I did yesterday.

856
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,189
I'm sore!

857
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:10,583
Not over, Noah!

858
01:24:10,793 --> 01:24:13,421
We have to live.

859
01:24:28,343 --> 01:24:30,937
We will stir up the animals.
Use fire!

860
01:24:31,814 --> 01:24:34,374
Fire!

861
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:37,051
Fire!

862
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:39,183
Fire!

863
01:24:42,724 --> 01:24:43,850
Fire!

864
01:25:01,944 --> 01:25:04,310
Fire, brothers!

865
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:41,476
The army of the Lord
is on our side!

866
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:42,772
Fast!

867
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:44,953
Mr?

868
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,382
Mr?

869
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:03,429
God!

870
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,264
Left someone ...

871
01:27:07,469 --> 01:27:09,835
Besides us, Sir?

872
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:12,968
Anyone?

873
01:27:13,175 --> 01:27:15,405
It will be so difficult!

874
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:21,072
Destroy humanity as well
It has not been easy for me.

875
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:24,675
If humanity
It's so bad, Mr ...

876
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:27,719
Why not populated
the world with Angels?

877
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:32,554
The problem of the Angels is that,
Although they decay ...

878
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:36,288
they are not perfect.
Humans, however ...

879
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:38,762
can decay ...

880
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:44,132
Yes, but they enhance.
Only it didn't.

881
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:49,676
I won't make the same mistake
again. So, maybe I do ...

882
01:27:49,878 --> 01:27:54,338
... a total cleaning.
-lnclusive us?

883
01:27:54,616 --> 01:27:55,776
I'm afraid so.

884
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:59,647
But, Lord, I follow
with my heart and my soul.

885
01:27:59,855 --> 01:28:02,380
At least save Naama and young people.

886
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:04,321
Take me, Lord. Take me.

887
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:07,222
To me, it's all or nothing, Noah.

888
01:28:07,429 --> 01:28:10,796
It is not fair.
-Not always the life is.

889
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:15,459
But I haven't decided.
I'll reflect carefully.

890
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:18,265
I'll be unavailable
for a while.

891
01:28:18,473 --> 01:28:20,407
And we will be ...

892
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:26,206
Alone. Will have to go
so without me.

893
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:28,881
Mr?

894
01:28:29,785 --> 01:28:32,049
Mr!

895
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:56,307
Come here!

896
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:59,309
Tell me yourself
something in this fog.

897
01:28:59,514 --> 01:29:00,572
We cannot divert?

898
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:05,687
We Could,
If we had the Government.

899
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:10,256
But, to have Government, we need
have a rudder, and we do not have.

900
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:23,030
Hate this silence!

901
01:29:25,841 --> 01:29:28,605
-Hello!
-Hello!

902
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:32,371
-Hello!
-Hello!

903
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:39,380
In recent weeks,
I have had a horrible thought.

904
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:42,284
I have hundreds.

905
01:29:44,659 --> 01:29:48,220
I think we are
walking in circles.

906
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:52,795
How can you find it?
Everything looks the same!

907
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:56,664
-So where are we?
-Up the river without a rudder.

908
01:29:56,872 --> 01:29:59,363
If we had markers!

909
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:12,579
What about this?

910
01:30:15,157 --> 01:30:17,785
If we look at this again, we will know
We're giving away rounds.

911
01:30:38,046 --> 01:30:43,109
We should have a rudder.
We are going in circles.

912
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:46,750
-Daddy know I'm smart.
-I also know.

913
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:49,253
Remember the time you wanted to convince you
the buy me a dress ...

914
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:51,891
and you almost convinced me
taking what I wore?

915
01:30:52,093 --> 01:30:55,119
I wanted to have a conversation
serious, can it be?

916
01:30:56,665 --> 01:30:58,724
Daddy should hear me.

917
01:30:58,934 --> 01:31:01,596
But he only listens to God.

918
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:06,563
What do you think?

919
01:31:34,302 --> 01:31:38,602
-You do not need to do this.
-I believe in sharing task.

920
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:42,338
I wanted to share another thing.

921
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:59,889
Look!

922
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:02,895
Saw what you made me do?
Could you have fallen!

923
01:32:03,098 --> 01:32:05,328
No, look!

924
01:32:08,303 --> 01:32:11,670
-Look!
-There! Over there!

925
01:32:21,283 --> 01:32:23,683
Noah, Noah? Look!

926
01:32:23,885 --> 01:32:26,376
We arrived on Earth!

927
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:35,790
That beautiful!

928
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:39,062
Is the paradise!

929
01:33:04,092 --> 01:33:07,118
That dirty cheating
cheat as well!

930
01:33:10,498 --> 01:33:13,296
Maybe it's some joke.

931
01:33:14,936 --> 01:33:17,166
Nobody laughed.

932
01:33:28,516 --> 01:33:32,509
It was horrible to make us feel
We had arrived at Earth.

933
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:34,889
My back.

934
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:39,550
Is this water.
Soak your bones.

935
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:44,222
The young people were bored.
You should try to cheer them.

936
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:47,333
Cheer them as?
With music and dancing?

937
01:33:47,535 --> 01:33:51,027
-Some juggling?
-Why not?

938
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:54,902
You know to be funny.
In the latest Gale, you said ...

939
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:59,706
that got so much that was
taking the lists of zebras.

940
01:33:59,914 --> 01:34:02,314
This was good.

941
01:34:02,517 --> 01:34:06,385
-They do not know that your side.
-I am the captain.

942
01:34:06,588 --> 01:34:11,218
Must have a severe air.
Especially now ...

943
01:34:11,826 --> 01:34:14,693
the Lord walks out.

944
01:34:15,997 --> 01:34:18,693
Naama?

945
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:22,302
Do you believe in the Lord?

946
01:34:23,371 --> 01:34:25,202
Yes.

947
01:34:25,407 --> 01:34:29,241
He saved us. But, sometimes,
I wonder why.

948
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:31,838
And our children?

949
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:35,877
-Believe In Him?
-I hope so.

950
01:34:36,684 --> 01:34:40,780
But, if you do not believe,
just because you believe.

951
01:34:48,129 --> 01:34:49,824
You have not answered
to my question.

952
01:34:51,132 --> 01:34:52,622
That question, dear?

953
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:56,393
God was thinking about what?

954
01:35:04,612 --> 01:35:06,739
If we destroy or not.

955
01:35:46,955 --> 01:35:49,219
Cam! Without!

956
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:52,116
Come!

957
01:35:56,831 --> 01:35:58,856
What is that?

958
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:03,499
-Another mirage. Is the Sun.
-But it's cloudy!

959
01:36:03,705 --> 01:36:06,401
May be someone
calling our attention.

960
01:36:10,712 --> 01:36:13,943
-Ali! There! There!
-What? What is it?

961
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:15,707
There!

962
01:36:39,607 --> 01:36:41,837
Who played my drink
in the sea?

963
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:47,178
We, father.

964
01:36:48,049 --> 01:36:50,415
Weeks ago.

965
01:36:50,618 --> 01:36:53,712
Thanks to his stupidity,
We are going in circles!

966
01:36:54,789 --> 01:36:57,451
In circles!

967
01:37:17,278 --> 01:37:19,769
What are you doing?

968
01:37:20,748 --> 01:37:23,774
What should have done since
the beginning! A rudder!

969
01:37:24,953 --> 01:37:26,648
Fixarei this mast at the door.

970
01:37:27,055 --> 01:37:29,649
-We will help you.
-His father will not allow.

971
01:37:30,391 --> 01:37:33,622
We will not be going round
the rest of your life!

972
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:36,629
Has reason.

973
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:41,328
Without rudder!

974
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:12,657
I'm wet.

975
01:38:13,935 --> 01:38:17,996
Should be ashamed, Noah,
fighting as a brat!

976
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,335
He would build a rudder,
contrary to the Lord!

977
01:38:30,952 --> 01:38:32,647
Lord, long ago
not talking.

978
01:38:33,321 --> 01:38:35,812
But there is no reason
for us to forget.

979
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:40,258
My children are challenging
my authority.

980
01:38:40,461 --> 01:38:44,295
And that means your authority.
I can't afford.

981
01:38:44,499 --> 01:38:47,730
But it is hard. I understand
Why are they against me.

982
01:38:47,935 --> 01:38:54,363
We don't progress,
just give laps. We are fools!

983
01:38:54,575 --> 01:38:57,339
There is a deeper purpose?

984
01:38:57,879 --> 01:39:01,645
Talk to me, Mr. Say something.

985
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,677
Even though it is goodbye.

986
01:39:15,096 --> 01:39:17,792
-I'm a dreamer.
-Only you?

987
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:20,460
So the common people
love us.

988
01:39:21,602 --> 01:39:27,700
We take a bit of joy
grey to their lives.

989
01:39:30,545 --> 01:39:33,946
If I cram my nose so ...

990
01:39:35,016 --> 01:39:38,110
I'll be with double chin
in the neck?

991
01:39:43,124 --> 01:39:46,616
Are getting crazy.

992
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:51,526
Have to wake up early
to deceive me.

993
01:39:52,934 --> 01:39:56,870
Yes, at noon.

994
01:39:57,071 --> 01:40:01,064
The only thing that sticks
at their head is hair.

995
01:40:01,275 --> 01:40:04,676
Not know how to count up to twenty
without taking off your shoes!

996
01:40:04,879 --> 01:40:09,373
You need to stay out of each other
to get an idea.

997
01:40:10,318 --> 01:40:13,048
If you don't respect me,
I devour you.

998
01:40:13,254 --> 01:40:15,916
If you had more judgement,
would already be an asshole.

999
01:40:20,695 --> 01:40:24,654
Children, we are here
to clarify some things.

1000
01:40:24,866 --> 01:40:26,857
Her father wants
say a few words.

1001
01:40:27,068 --> 01:40:29,832
I thought in my
old friend.

1002
01:40:30,037 --> 01:40:32,631
If he were alive today,
It would be very rich. Don't make noise.

1003
01:40:36,244 --> 01:40:37,711
Noah, what was?

1004
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:40,544
I feel like if you tried to run
with legs tied.

1005
01:40:40,815 --> 01:40:41,907
What do you think, Japheth?

1006
01:40:44,218 --> 01:40:46,311
-Nothing.
-So it was good.

1007
01:40:46,521 --> 01:40:49,422
I think that would not live without you,
but just think.

1008
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:52,420
Noah, my well
you are beside themselves.

1009
01:40:52,827 --> 01:40:55,159
So, who am I?
Don't make noise!

1010
01:40:56,798 --> 01:40:59,494
-Best you rest.
-Drop the keel ...

1011
01:41:00,668 --> 01:41:04,104
Download the candle and stand clamp
principal. All on deck!

1012
01:41:21,055 --> 01:41:25,424
I'm going to establish the dividing line.
It's up here, and ready!

1013
01:41:26,994 --> 01:41:29,462
The sky!

1014
01:41:31,999 --> 01:41:34,126
Is bleeding!

1015
01:41:37,572 --> 01:41:40,507
Is bleeding!

1016
01:41:55,156 --> 01:41:58,250
I won! I won!
Crown me with leaves!

1017
01:41:58,459 --> 01:42:02,054
-Put sauerkraut on my hair!
-I'll take care of it.

1018
01:42:02,263 --> 01:42:03,355
Guys, you take care of the Ark.

1019
01:42:03,564 --> 01:42:05,998
Cam, you're the oldest.
Will be responsible.

1020
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,361
I will not disappoint her.

1021
01:42:11,572 --> 01:42:13,904
Have a boat to operate.

1022
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:22,112
Has a young man at helm station now.

1023
01:42:22,783 --> 01:42:25,843
New blood.
new ldéias.

1024
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:33,952
-Lead us! We are with the Lord.
-Exact! Has our support.

1025
01:42:34,161 --> 01:42:39,394
-Take us home, Captain!
-We will not be more without rudders.

1026
01:42:39,634 --> 01:42:43,570
-Arrives to wander aimlessly.
-steady! He is our man!

1027
01:42:43,771 --> 01:42:48,174
-Sail for home!
-Take us, Lord. Is our captain.

1028
01:42:48,376 --> 01:42:50,970
Is our leader.

1029
01:42:51,512 --> 01:42:54,003
The orders, Captain.

1030
01:42:56,017 --> 01:42:58,781
-At orders!
-Take us home, Captain!

1031
01:42:59,353 --> 01:43:03,983
Damn sight!
that is a riot!

1032
01:43:55,276 --> 01:43:58,643
Has monsters under the bed.
I will though!

1033
01:44:06,487 --> 01:44:08,648
Who burned toadstool?
I will not tolerate!

1034
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:11,287
Silence when talking
with the captain!

1035
01:44:12,627 --> 01:44:15,960
Old fool!
No one is listening.

1036
01:44:16,964 --> 01:44:19,398
See if it dies!

1037
01:44:20,334 --> 01:44:25,237
Your time has passed.
Go eat grass.

1038
01:44:25,906 --> 01:44:28,306
You're old!

1039
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:31,574
Rest in peace!

1040
01:44:32,546 --> 01:44:33,535
Rest in peace!

1041
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:36,108
Rest in peace!

1042
01:44:37,618 --> 01:44:43,454
I'll see you dead, ungrateful children
and daughters of perdition!

1043
01:44:44,392 --> 01:44:47,190
I deserdo!

1044
01:44:47,595 --> 01:44:49,153
Throw it overboard!

1045
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:52,765
-I'm ready!
-Know recognize a riot!

1046
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:57,227
-Take its carcass of my boat!
-I'm not crazy to think.

1047
01:44:57,438 --> 01:44:59,702
Show your strength. Let's go.

1048
01:44:59,907 --> 01:45:03,468
Make mincemeat of you.
Come.

1049
01:45:03,678 --> 01:45:04,702
Let's go.

1050
01:45:09,784 --> 01:45:11,979
The Lord Almighty ...

1051
01:45:12,186 --> 01:45:18,489
has 1 .60 m tall.
It is softly! I saw him.

1052
01:45:18,793 --> 01:45:21,353
Naama?

1053
01:45:22,663 --> 01:45:26,258
-What are you doing?
-I wouldn't call Naama.

1054
01:45:26,467 --> 01:45:29,129
I am the Lord's will.

1055
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:32,268
We will, we will, we will ...

1056
01:45:32,473 --> 01:45:37,968
everything, everything, everything, everything ... until we
burst, burst, burst.

1057
01:45:38,512 --> 01:45:41,675
Mom! You need to rest.

1058
01:45:42,516 --> 01:45:44,313
What do I need ...

1059
01:45:44,518 --> 01:45:47,681
is two birds and a stone.
And, remember ...

1060
01:45:47,888 --> 01:45:51,221
never cry on
the milk protected.

1061
01:46:00,067 --> 01:46:02,592
Thank You, Pegasus.

1062
01:46:02,903 --> 01:46:06,999
Two legs are not enough
to support a woman like me.

1063
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,197
Go to your room now.

1064
01:46:09,477 --> 01:46:11,570
What shall we do?

1065
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:14,543
-We'll shoot it.
-With what?

1066
01:46:14,749 --> 01:46:16,683
Throw away that damn fruit!

1067
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:22,780
We will, we will, we will
everything, everything, everything that we, we ...

1068
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:26,448
We have to stop this cantoria.
Is horrible!

1069
01:46:27,161 --> 01:46:28,822
Naama?

1070
01:46:29,029 --> 01:46:32,795
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1071
01:46:33,634 --> 01:46:36,797
-Got it!
-Calm. Calm. Take it down.

1072
01:46:37,004 --> 01:46:39,472
No! No! Run!
Attempt to save!

1073
01:46:39,673 --> 01:46:42,972
-Put it on the bed.
-Are the little monsters!

1074
01:46:43,177 --> 01:46:45,168
Calm. Slowly.

1075
01:46:45,379 --> 01:46:47,779
Are the little monsters!

1076
01:46:47,982 --> 01:46:51,816
God, we need more
What ever of the Lord!

1077
01:46:52,019 --> 01:46:54,954
Still,
left us adrift!

1078
01:46:55,156 --> 01:46:58,785
We need a signal.
Give us a sign.

1079
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:09,927
-How's MOM?
-Better.

1080
01:47:10,137 --> 01:47:13,106
-But can barely speak.
-Like all of us.

1081
01:47:14,308 --> 01:47:16,538
-What shall we do?
-What can we do ...

1082
01:47:16,744 --> 01:47:19,144
until the Lord give us a sign?

1083
01:47:19,346 --> 01:47:22,213
What about making a rudder?

1084
01:47:23,584 --> 01:47:26,314
I'm not so old for not having
learned certain lessons.

1085
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,284
I won't stop you,
If you think that will advance.

1086
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,354
Will not.

1087
01:47:35,563 --> 01:47:38,054
We can go anywhere,
North, South, East or West ...

1088
01:47:38,265 --> 01:47:40,790
will make no difference.

1089
01:47:42,403 --> 01:47:45,668
There is nothing but water.

1090
01:47:48,142 --> 01:47:50,667
We die here.

1091
01:47:52,313 --> 01:47:55,043
Ghosts, a Ghost ship.

1092
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:05,823
I asked the Lord
to send us a signal.

1093
01:48:16,437 --> 01:48:19,133
Go Search land!

1094
01:49:23,103 --> 01:49:27,130
Pronto.
Is already at home again.

1095
01:49:42,022 --> 01:49:46,254
Mr? How long
We met?

1096
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,451
Enough time
so I can say ...

1097
01:49:48,662 --> 01:49:51,222
This is the way to govern
your world?

1098
01:49:51,432 --> 01:49:54,799
Dealing with us without mercy
and going crazy?

1099
01:49:55,035 --> 01:49:56,969
Tell me, what do I do
This your land?

1100
01:49:57,171 --> 01:50:00,971
I silence always
for a good reason.

1101
01:50:01,175 --> 01:50:03,939
Is the Lord?

1102
01:50:04,144 --> 01:50:08,877
-Yes!
-Long time no talk.

1103
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:13,041
Have you decided what to do
with us, Sir?

1104
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,354
It was a tough decision.
I wanted to get a second opinion.

1105
01:50:17,558 --> 01:50:21,892
But from whom? I am sorry, Noah.

1106
01:50:22,096 --> 01:50:25,224
I decided to end it all.

1107
01:50:25,432 --> 01:50:29,232
Came out all wrong from the beginning,
When Adam sinned in paradise.

1108
01:50:29,436 --> 01:50:32,530
The men created a world
without salvation, full of blood ...

1109
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:37,734
where good and evil become one.
The Ark, and all aboard her ...

1110
01:50:37,945 --> 01:50:41,244
will be sucked by oblivion.

1111
01:50:41,882 --> 01:50:46,683
In the end, this is little thing.
Is going through the portal ...

1112
01:50:46,887 --> 01:50:49,412
to the paradise.

1113
01:50:58,932 --> 01:51:01,594
And so Noah?

1114
01:51:01,802 --> 01:51:06,296
No requests for mercy?
Nothing tears? Or cries?

1115
01:51:08,776 --> 01:51:11,540
What you're doing, Noah?

1116
01:51:16,817 --> 01:51:18,045
Noah?

1117
01:51:18,252 --> 01:51:22,621
I am not worthy to offer
my tears. So, I whistle.

1118
01:51:22,823 --> 01:51:25,383
Only that.

1119
01:51:27,494 --> 01:51:29,826
Whistle?

1120
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:32,191
Whistle ...

1121
01:51:35,202 --> 01:51:37,432
Ah, Noah ...

1122
01:51:38,005 --> 01:51:40,599
Ah, Noah ...

1123
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:55,552
Noah!

1124
01:51:59,026 --> 01:52:04,396
Noah! You was tender
my heart once more.

1125
01:52:05,899 --> 01:52:10,996
Spare you and your world.
A last chance, Noah.

1126
01:52:11,205 --> 01:52:15,369
-A last chance.
-Thank you, thank you, Sir ...

1127
01:52:15,576 --> 01:52:19,603
by Grace granted me.

1128
01:52:19,813 --> 01:52:25,547
Tomorrow I'll give you a signal.
Send a bird.

1129
01:52:26,887 --> 01:52:30,050
I sent.
I sent a Raven.

1130
01:52:30,257 --> 01:52:35,593
Crows are agourentos!
Noah, send a dove.

1131
01:52:41,902 --> 01:52:44,370
Will not try the business
the bird again, will you?

1132
01:52:47,174 --> 01:52:48,607
The Lord came to us.

1133
01:52:49,676 --> 01:52:52,474
-Didn't notice that He had departed.
-He had.

1134
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:55,045
Why we suffer
of madness and despair.

1135
01:52:55,249 --> 01:52:58,309
-Keep in despair.
-All of us! I'm not like that.

1136
01:52:58,519 --> 01:53:02,979
-I am always very happy.
-Will change. Trust me.

1137
01:53:03,757 --> 01:53:06,749
Father, once you gave me
two Councils.

1138
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,487
Said: '' never sleep with a woman
more problematic that you. ''

1139
01:53:10,697 --> 01:53:12,790
And '' Never trust a man
that say ' trust me '.

1140
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:19,063
I do not remember. But trust me,
as I trust in the Lord God.

1141
01:53:22,476 --> 01:53:24,876
Mom?

1142
01:53:27,114 --> 01:53:31,517
-Should not have raised.
-I wanted to breathe fresh air.

1143
01:53:32,119 --> 01:53:33,177
Feels like, MOM?

1144
01:53:34,254 --> 01:53:35,846
I feel much better.

1145
01:53:36,623 --> 01:53:41,185
Good. The Lord sent me
drop this Dove ...

1146
01:53:41,395 --> 01:53:43,420
to see if it brings some signal.

1147
01:53:44,298 --> 01:53:46,061
So don't be talking about.
Drop it.

1148
01:53:48,835 --> 01:53:51,133
What do you guys think?

1149
01:53:52,906 --> 01:53:55,067
Worse is impossible.

1150
01:54:01,949 --> 01:54:04,179
What harm do?

1151
01:54:06,853 --> 01:54:10,345
Noah? MOM is right.
Drop it!

1152
01:54:17,931 --> 01:54:20,161
Go!

1153
01:55:37,644 --> 01:55:39,111
She returned.

1154
01:55:43,116 --> 01:55:44,310
She returned!

1155
01:55:44,651 --> 01:55:45,879
Ruth!

1156
01:55:46,086 --> 01:55:48,054
Father! Father! Everyone!

1157
01:55:48,255 --> 01:55:49,449
She returned!

1158
01:56:01,468 --> 01:56:05,666
Stay there. Stay there. Cute little bird!
Cute ...

1159
01:56:07,874 --> 01:56:10,138
Leave me, leave me.

1160
01:56:10,344 --> 01:56:12,244
Will ...

1161
01:56:15,649 --> 01:56:19,745
I'd pick. Why do I hurt?
Yes, you hurt me.

1162
01:56:29,029 --> 01:56:30,087
Thank You.

1163
01:56:31,131 --> 01:56:33,565
I picked it up.

1164
01:56:35,736 --> 01:56:36,998
Saw?

1165
01:56:38,038 --> 01:56:39,972
She found the Earth.

1166
01:56:43,043 --> 01:56:45,034
Look!

1167
01:56:47,481 --> 01:56:49,472
Look at it!

1168
01:57:38,165 --> 01:57:41,464
They are very happy
to see it well, dear.

1169
01:57:43,437 --> 01:57:45,871
Also I missed you.

1170
01:57:46,072 --> 01:57:50,008
Isn't it wonderful the Lord
have decided to spare us?

1171
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:53,702
-It will no longer destroy us.
-But of course not.

1172
01:57:54,948 --> 01:57:58,475
You seem to have received
the news quietly.

1173
01:57:58,685 --> 01:58:01,518
It seems that already knew.

1174
01:58:02,789 --> 01:58:05,257
But I knew.

1175
01:59:16,897 --> 01:59:19,491
Saw something?

1176
01:59:26,573 --> 01:59:29,201
Anything.

1177
01:59:30,176 --> 01:59:33,612
Cam, think you have some
something there that there before?

1178
01:59:34,648 --> 01:59:37,412
Yes. Hope.

1179
01:59:37,617 --> 01:59:41,212
-But has Earth?
-If you have ...

1180
01:59:41,421 --> 01:59:42,786
We'll meet.

1181
01:59:45,759 --> 01:59:48,592
This is what I always liked you.

1182
01:59:55,468 --> 01:59:57,333
So like me
for some reason.

1183
01:59:59,739 --> 02:00:02,674
You are always so confident ...

1184
02:00:02,876 --> 02:00:05,310
even when it is wrong.

1185
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,472
Japheth?

1186
02:01:11,277 --> 02:01:12,505
Without!

1187
02:01:26,326 --> 02:01:27,486
What is that?

1188
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:56,552
The Lord has saved us,
as said that would save.

1189
02:01:59,826 --> 02:02:03,318
We should thank him.
Come. Come.

1190
02:02:04,798 --> 02:02:07,596
No, father, there is no time.

1191
02:02:08,134 --> 02:02:10,068
Not?

1192
02:03:09,996 --> 02:03:11,361
Run!

1193
02:03:11,564 --> 02:03:12,792
Run!

1194
02:03:13,366 --> 02:03:17,826
-Back! Behind!
-Run! Let's go!

1195
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:43,085
We arrived on Earth.

1196
02:03:47,233 --> 02:03:49,633
We arrived on Earth!

1197
02:03:49,836 --> 02:03:52,202
We arrived on Earth!

1198
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:20,531
Hello!

1199
02:04:24,137 --> 02:04:26,298
Hello!

1200
02:04:54,167 --> 02:04:58,069
'' The Lord said:
' Multiply! '' '

1201
02:05:03,343 --> 02:05:06,210
Cam? You have something
to tell us?

1202
02:05:12,919 --> 02:05:15,581
They want to go.

1203
02:05:18,024 --> 02:05:21,858
Doesn't mean we don't love them.
We love.

1204
02:05:22,495 --> 02:05:25,225
But it's time to fly the nest.

1205
02:05:25,431 --> 02:05:28,195
Is natural.

1206
02:07:05,531 --> 02:07:08,261
Were all, father.

1207
02:07:09,469 --> 02:07:12,267
-Anybody else?
-Anybody else? Over?

1208
02:07:12,872 --> 02:07:14,032
Wake Up!

1209
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:17,073
Hardly any.

1210
02:07:17,577 --> 02:07:20,171
I think we let go everyone.

1211
02:07:20,913 --> 02:07:24,644
-Empty.
-Not. Waiting.

1212
02:07:33,926 --> 02:07:36,918
You almost lost to time!

1213
02:07:40,433 --> 02:07:42,833
Will the animals
will continue our friends?

1214
02:07:43,036 --> 02:07:44,901
Yes, if we treat as friends.

1215
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:58,941
Your sleepers!

1216
02:08:06,225 --> 02:08:09,217
There are no priests or men
of God here, just me.

1217
02:08:09,429 --> 02:08:14,025
Then, as captain, celebrate
the wedding ceremony.

1218
02:08:15,668 --> 02:08:17,863
How is the ceremony, father?

1219
02:08:18,071 --> 02:08:20,369
I don't know, I just ...

1220
02:08:20,573 --> 02:08:23,633
Make equal to ours, Noah.

1221
02:08:23,843 --> 02:08:27,973
For many years.
Let me see...

1222
02:08:28,915 --> 02:08:31,782
I think I remember party
more important.

1223
02:08:31,984 --> 02:08:33,679
Great.

1224
02:08:33,886 --> 02:08:36,650
Sons and daughters ...

1225
02:08:36,856 --> 02:08:41,884
You will behave
with decency and honor?

1226
02:08:42,795 --> 02:08:46,060
Will respect one another?

1227
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,335
Will love joy ...

1228
02:08:50,536 --> 02:08:53,027
and in sorrow?

1229
02:08:53,573 --> 02:08:56,440
Yes.

1230
02:08:56,642 --> 02:08:59,406
Very well. Over?

1231
02:09:01,447 --> 02:09:04,541
I think the Lord
do not oppose this.

1232
02:09:47,894 --> 02:09:50,294
Take care of it.

1233
02:10:10,183 --> 02:10:12,743
Without.

1234
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:54,291
Will they be OK?

1235
02:10:54,493 --> 02:10:58,293
They are young.
Is an adventure.

1236
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,491
Noah?

1237
02:11:38,371 --> 02:11:40,236
I was ...

1238
02:11:40,439 --> 02:11:43,499
thinking of everything
What happened, Mr.

1239
02:11:43,709 --> 02:11:46,507
Yes.

1240
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:51,941
There are parts that can be counted
with words ...

1241
02:11:52,151 --> 02:11:54,642
other ...

1242
02:11:55,655 --> 02:11:58,488
only with silence.

1243
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:04,296
I may have exceeded me.

1244
02:12:04,997 --> 02:12:08,194
I am single, eternal, perfect.

1245
02:12:08,401 --> 02:12:11,131
But I can fool me.

1246
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:15,664
Don't ask me to explain, Noah.

1247
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:22,973
Saw humanity destroyed,
and I know that this is not the way.

1248
02:12:23,182 --> 02:12:28,279
Need of man, as he me.
We have completed.

1249
02:12:28,487 --> 02:12:34,357
So, there needs to be a Pact
between us. With one another.

1250
02:12:36,095 --> 02:12:37,585
Do not raise my hand ...

1251
02:12:37,797 --> 02:12:41,096
Even though the Earth
stay in the hands of the bad guys?

1252
02:12:42,835 --> 02:12:46,828
I'll be in silence.
And I will not destroy it.

1253
02:12:47,907 --> 02:12:50,740
Thank You, Mr.

1254
02:12:51,377 --> 02:12:55,746
Humanity is able to
shredding-if alone, Noah.

1255
02:12:55,948 --> 02:12:59,611
She don't need
my help.
