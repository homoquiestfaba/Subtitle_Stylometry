358
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,496
Mr. Bishop,

359
00:31:34,963 --> 00:31:36,799
you shouldn't misunderstand.

360
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:40,870
It is not in my interest to have
my family name defiled.

361
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:45,340
Little Lucy, here, is telling me
just that is taking place.

362
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:47,810
Some things

363
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,647
I need to take time to think
about

364
00:31:52,414 --> 00:31:54,750
and some things I do not.

365
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:56,685
This...

366
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,587
I do not.

367
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:00,422
No.

368
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,894
I am here to see that both sides
are adequately taken care of,

369
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,496
to ensure a clean and successful
outcome.

370
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,999
That's all anyone wants.

371
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:13,301
Clean. Successful.

372
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,273
What was Lucy's offer to you,
Max?

373
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:22,143
MAX:

LUCY:

376
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:33,388
Now, that will certainly get you
a body in the ground.

377
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:36,090
But, will it get you security?

What do you think, Max?

381
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,737
Well, the thing of it is, Mr.
Sergio,

382
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:54,409
factored into that quote was the
idea that Lucy would not, uhh,

383
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:59,615
share certain information about
me with certain individuals,

384
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,716

390

00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,435
what's with the clearance aisle

392
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:21,469

394
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,506

<i>Listen to what I'm concerned

399
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:35,918
There is no honor
amongst an $8,000 dollar crowd.

400
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:38,621

401

403
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:48,029
Would a member of the $8,000
crowd

404
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:50,231
have the honor

405
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,100

406
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,736

407
00:33:55,704 --> 00:33:56,805

Beyond that,

413
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,255
I think that crowd

414
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:16,391
would be able to help us

00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:19,895

Six months.

It's an option.

But maybe...

00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:19,387
maybe you need to get creative.

Consequently, you need patience,

438
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,258
you do need diligence

439
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:26,829

Uh, this is not
a super serious situation.

893
01:08:46,327 --> 01:08:48,129
- Uh, uh-
- I talked to someone yesterday

894
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:50,833
who said if you have a problem,
it's best not to rush things.

895
01:08:51,132 --> 01:08:52,901
You should
always try to take it in-

01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:55,403
Yeah, like, I'm sure, like,
that was a great piece of information

Max, I got your letter.
Just so you know, it's not Tourette's.

902
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:17,425
Ruby has a social condition
that sometimes fails to inhibit

903
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,028

Not really.

Makes sense, thank you.

910
01:09:33,809 --> 01:09:35,577
Max, was it because
you shot a guy up there?

911
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:37,813
He was gonna kill Ruby.

01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:40,415

No.

No!

My dad said
he'll pay you for your time.

922
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:03,505
He asked about a time sheet?

923
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:04,973
Sure.

- Me too!

- No!
- Remember when the guy

01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:17,186
- No!
- fell out of the tree because

933
01:10:17,218 --> 01:10:18,687
- he was getting chased by the
chipmunk-

934
01:10:18,721 --> 01:10:20,923
