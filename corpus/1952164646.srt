1
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:20,937
Hello.

2
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,939
Why don't you answer?

3
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:27,780
Get out of there!

4
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,077
Um, I don't...

5
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,879
They'll...your leg...

6
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:40,322
''Out of Range''

7
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,385
Get away!

8
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,259
They'll cut off your leg!

9
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,357
''Ashikari, Help!''

10
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:30,229
''X-CROSS''

11
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,709
Hello? Hey, how are you?

12
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,743
I'm heading to
the hot springs with a friend.

13
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,243
''Chapter One''

14
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:54,479
''The white cell phone,
in the closet.''

15
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:59,389
Oh, really? Too bad.
Invite me again sometime.

16
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:05,326
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:06,454
Bye.

18
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:15,431
Hey, are you sure
this is the right road?

19
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,042
I don't know, probably.

20
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:20,236
What do you mean ''probably''?
Read the map!

21
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,881
Shiyori, Blood type A,
Luckiest week for love.

22
00:05:24,017 --> 00:05:27,418
You may meet your soul mate.
Go for it!

23
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,545
Blood type B...
''Watch for stalkers''?

24
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,952
Oh, too bad.

25
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:37,625
Exactly how many guys
are you dating, Aiko?

26
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,567
Three...No, make that four.

27
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,196
Are you really in love
with all of them?

28
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,067
Well, I guess, sort of.

29
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,507
''Sort of'?

30
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:56,206
I don't want to get hurt
the way you did.

31
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,510
Meaning?

32
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:02,712
''Sort of' is better to
not get hurt.

33
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:06,450
Keep a certain distance
and nobody gets hurt.

34
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,732
Is that true for me, too?

35
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,103
What?

36
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:27,445
Am I just a ''sort of' friend
to you?

37
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:34,643
Hey, don't get all serious on me.

38
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,048
Watch out!

39
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:49,368
Ouch...

40
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,306
Hey, what are you doing?

41
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,643
Snip, snip, snip...

42
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:10,747
Snip, snip, snip...

43
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:13,784
Hell.

44
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:21,157
Have you ever seen
the true face...

45
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:24,460
of hell?

46
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,879
Snip, snip, snip...

47
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,394
Hey, the reception here sucks!

48
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:30,968
How's yours, Shiyori?

49
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,538
Mine's out of range, too.

50
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,580
Here's a map.

51
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,212
We're here now.

52
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,252
-The inn?
-Here?

53
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,413
The baths!

54
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:55,755
It's still a long way to the inn.
How will we get there?

55
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,792
What'll we do?

56
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:08,637
Hello?

57
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,881
You're guests at
the hot springs inn?

58
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,381
Welcome to Ashikari village.

59
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,385
Please, get in the car.

60
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,085
Please, please.

61
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:31,293
Let's go.

62
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,197
Don't be shy.

63
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:40,938
Welcome, welcome.

64
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:43,772
Thank you for coming
such a long way to visit us.

65
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:45,969
Welcome.

66
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:07,031
''Welcome to Ashikari village''

67
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:45,027
Thank you for visiting us.

68
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,298
This is a pretty fancy inn
for the middle of nowhere.

69
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:56,071
All the villagers built it
together to welcome our guests.

70
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,282
The villagers?

71
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:06,616
We've been loggers
for generations.

72
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:13,731
How many people
live in this village?

73
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:17,995
(Ashikari dialect)

74
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,802
Excuse me?

75
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:29,643
That's why,
it's just us old folks here now.

76
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,558
''Asamiya Keiichi''

77
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:52,163
I'll leave
your bathing gowns here.

78
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:56,534
May I serve dinner
after your bath?

79
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:58,206
Yes.

80
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,711
The hot springs are relaxing.

81
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,408
Please take care to
wash your legs.

82
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:29,506
We landed in one helluva place.

83
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:40,743
-It didn't matter where...
-What?

84
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:46,090
So long as
it was far away from him.

85
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:50,161
Is it really over?

86
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,456
So he cheated on you once.
It's no big deal

87
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,429
You wouldn't understand.

88
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,240
What?

89
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,576
You've never really
cried over anyone.

90
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,941
You date all those guys.

91
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:16,377
I don't even want you
to understand how I feel.

92
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,724
He was my very first boyfriend.

93
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,524
So what?

94
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:33,903
I'm going back to the room.

95
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:56,928
Hello, it's me.

96
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,021
Shiyori just left the baths.

97
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,899
Yeah, everything's on schedule.

98
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:18,543
''Shiyori, let's talk.
Please answer. Keiichi''

99
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,034
Shiyori!

100
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,368
Shiyori!

101
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:16,618
Hello?

102
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:19,087
Why don't you answer?

103
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,028
Get out of there!

104
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,860
Um, I don't...

105
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,025
They'll...your leg...

106
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,871
''From Mononobe Akira''

107
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,500
Get away!

108
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,306
They'll cut off your leg!

109
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,003
How was your bath?

110
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,713
Lovely, thank you.

111
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:20,717
Please eat your dinner
while it's hot.

112
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:25,421
Call me on the house phone
when you finished the dinner.

113
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:26,785
Thank you.

114
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,173
Hello?

115
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:22,212
What's wrong? What happened?

116
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,246
No, not really.

117
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,178
Get out of there now!

118
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:30,716
If they catch you,
they'll sacrifice you.

119
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,222
Is this a prank call?

120
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:38,488
This isn't even my cell phone.

121
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:43,966
Who are you?

122
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:45,660
I am...

123
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:46,828
You're not Shizuka?

124
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,234
No, I'm not.

125
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:52,309
Why, why do you have
my sister's phone?

126
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,935
I'm staying here with my friend.

127
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,572
I found this cell phone
in the closet.

128
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,684
Oh, no...

129
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,486
Don't tell me Shizuka's already...

130
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,540
-What is this?
-What happened?

131
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,373
Suddenly, all the lights went out.

132
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:30,813
I get it. They've finally done it.

133
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,111
Who's they?

134
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:37,414
Who are you? What's going on?

135
00:21:56,141 --> 00:22:00,635
Dear guest,
have you cleaned your leg?

136
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,779
About the power failure,
there's no need to worry.

137
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,114
I'll be there right away.

138
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,411
Don't bother, I'm going to bed!

139
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,792
What did you mean when
you said they'd sacrifice me?

140
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:23,791
I'm not sure you're going
to believe what I have to say.

141
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:25,425
Go ahead, tell me.

142
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,239
I'm Mononobe Akira.

143
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:34,406
I'm researching folklore
at Jonan University.

144
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:39,174
-Folklore?
-Yes.

145
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:43,316
In ancient Japan,

146
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,317
they used to sacrifice
young women,

147
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:50,156
in order to ward off disasters.

148
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:56,097
They used to in Ashikari village,
where you are now.

149
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:27,127
Originally, Ashikari was
a loggers' village.

150
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,064
In order to prevent their wives
from fleeing the village...

151
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:35,333
while the men were cutting
down trees in the mountains,

152
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:39,476
they cut off
their wives' left legs.

153
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,539
That's how this grim
tradition began.

154
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,354
Eventually, the villagers captured
traveling women,

155
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:57,292
offering them as living sacrifice
to the mountains.

156
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,371
The sacrificed women...

157
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:18,114
were locked up in a shrine
on the mountain.

158
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:23,953
To this day, they've secretly
kept the tradition alive.

159
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,890
You've seen how
all the villagers limp?

160
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:33,957
As soon as a baby is born, they
cut the tendons in the left leg.

161
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,163
To brand them...

162
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:38,935
and to keep them
from running away.

163
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,216
lmpossible!

164
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,123
I know you
don't want to believe it.

165
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,191
But you saw for yourself.

166
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:10,630
All the scarecrows
around the village.

167
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:14,903
They're not decorations.

168
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:18,174
They're mummies of the dead women,

169
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:20,768
worshiped as gods.

170
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:28,286
Watch out!
The rituaI's already begun!

171
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:58,511
Oh, goddess!

172
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:07,716
I've brought you a light.

173
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,692
It's dangerous in the dark.

174
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,088
Dear guest.

175
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:16,200
What's going on?

176
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:20,100
Hello? hello?

177
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,869
Hello.

178
00:26:23,408 --> 00:26:24,705
Please tell me your name.

179
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:29,344
I'm Mizuno Shiyori.

180
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:30,947
Shiyori.

181
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,677
I want to help you.

182
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:40,223
Either you believe what I told you
or they cut your leg off?

183
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,955
The choice is yours.

184
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,295
Hello, hello, Mononobe!

185
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:51,800
Please, wait!

186
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:54,529
Are you all right?

187
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,776
If you won't open the door,
I'm coming in.

188
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:36,405
Not this one.

189
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:42,312
Why don't you answer, Aiko?

190
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:17,288
''It's awful! Contact me now.
Shiyori''

191
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:39,304
Please, Aiko, answer! Please!

192

''Incoming EmaiI''

193
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,116
''Help! Waiting in the toilet
by the bath. Aiko.''

194
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:54,251
-Mononobe!
-Where are you?

195
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:57,021
I escaped from the lodge.

196
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,789
Did you bring the village map?

197
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,760
Yes.

198
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:07,166
They'll have shut all
the main roads down by now.

199
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,133
It's a little far but there's
an old tunnel on the east side.

200
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:17,075
Wait for me there.
I'm driving towards you now.

201
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:18,947
I understand.

202
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:23,251
By the way,
I have an important question.

203
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:27,614
How did you learn about
Ashikari village?

204
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,428
A friend of mine from school...
Her name's Aiko.

205
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:35,795
She invited me
to the hot springs here.

206
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:40,897
I've got to go help her.

207
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,635
How did she
learn about the village?

208
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,676
On the Internet, she said.

209
00:29:47,612 --> 00:29:48,636
I doubt it.

210
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:52,673
According to my research,

211
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:57,254
there's nothing on the Internet
about Ashikari village.

212
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:03,618
Oh, no, then Aiko's...

213
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:06,192
She may be one of them.

214
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:22,839
Hello?

215
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:24,710
Listen, Shiyori.

216
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:28,583
You've got to get out alive.

217
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,213
If you want to survive,

218
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:35,220
don't trust anyone or anything.

219
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,463
Hello, hello!

220
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,099
Aiko.

221
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:45,814
Please...

222
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:48,115
Answer, Aiko.

223
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:54,795
Please.

224
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:55,990
Hello?

225
00:32:56,134 --> 00:33:00,070
Hello, Aiko!
Thank god you're okay.

226
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:01,762
I was so worried.

227
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:05,604
Shiyori, what phone
are you calling from?

228
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:09,509
I'll tell you later!
Tell me, where are you?

229
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:12,880
In the toilet.

230
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:16,011
What? But I'm in the toilet.

231
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:20,282
You're in a different toilet.

232
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:34,596
Just watch out for the villagers.

233
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,066
This village is like sicko!

234
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:45,340
-Aiko...
-What?

235
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:51,810
You're not tricking me, are you?

236
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:54,183
What do you mean?

237
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,160
I can really trust you, right?

238
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:08,429
Answer me.

239
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,440
Why can't you answer! Aiko!

240
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:18,409
Listen, Shiyori. The truth is...

241
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:24,554
Hello, Aiko, Aiko!

242
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,123
What's wrong! Hello!

243
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:21,202
Aiko?

244
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:34,721
Hello?

245
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:35,757
Yayoi?

246
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:38,689
What, Shiyori?

247
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:43,656
Thank god, I got through!

248
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,894
You're my only friend.

249
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,830
Please, Yayoi, help me.

250
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,732
What's going on?

251
00:35:53,578 --> 00:35:56,445

''No Matching Documents''

253
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,310
That guy, Mononobe's story
does make sense.

254
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:08,353
But there's no proof that
you can trust him either.

255
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:11,723
And the cell phone you're using,

256
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,458
we don't even know
if there really is a Shizuka.

257
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:17,596
But...

258
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:21,193
In any case, I'll call the police.

259
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,773
And I'll check out
this guy Mononobe.

260
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:24,897
Thank you.

261
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,437
And I don't like saying this...

262
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:31,571
but...watch out for Aiko.

263
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:37,620
What's that supposed to mean?

264
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:40,417
She's just not my type.

265
00:36:41,092 --> 00:36:43,026
Frankly, I don't trust her.

266
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,164
You're too trusting.

267
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,736
People take advantage of you.

268
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:57,840
But believe in yourself
and don't give up.

269
00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:01,441
I wish I could go help you.

270
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,913
But I wouldn't be much help...

271
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:09,608

You're not tricking me, are you?

276
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:19,322
I can really trust you, right?

277
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,090
I'm going back to the room.

278
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:54,290
Hello, it's me.

279
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:57,384

What's up with that person?

288
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:39,525
Found you.

289
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:41,924

Finally, we're alone together.

00:46:03,787 --> 00:46:06,017
Miss Hiuke Aiko.

292
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,131
Cute.

293
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:21,932
I wonder how many men
you've seduced?

294
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,563
May I have your name?

295
00:46:27,144 --> 00:46:29,112
You remember Tezuka Yuta?

296
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,148
Cruel.

297
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:43,755
Cruel.

298
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:47,186
He was my boyfriend,
you stole him!

299
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:54,601
Can't keep track
of all the men you dumped?

300
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:58,967
Oh, maybe...

301
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:02,041
Remember?

00:47:02,813 --> 00:47:07,182
I'm Tezuka Yuta's ex-girlfriend.

303
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:09,114
You swiped him from me...

304
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:11,448
and dumped him in no time.

-That's it?
-What?

309
00:47:51,395 --> 00:47:53,556
You're really going
to kill me for that?

310
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,358
That's it?

311
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:58,059
Do you know how much I suffered?

312
00:47:59,736 --> 00:48:01,601

Tell me, where are you?

367
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:42,029
In the toilet.

368
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:45,067
What? But I'm in the toilet.

369
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,666
You're in a different toilet.

370
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:07,849
You're not tricking me, are you?

371
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:09,984
What do you mean?

372
00:56:11,628 --> 00:56:15,997
I can really trust you, right?

373
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,006
Answer me.

374
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:28,037
Why can't you answer! Aiko!

375
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:34,942
Listen, Shiyori. The truth is...

376
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:40,855
What's going on?

377
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,288
Hello, hello!

378
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:04,212
No!

379
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:12,279
I'm sorry, please forgive me!

380
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:54,453
Come on!

381
00:58:09,746 --> 00:58:11,043
I'm pissed.

382
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:19,879
You're going to pay for this.

383
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,234
Get ready.

384
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:34,947
I won't fall for that twice!

385
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,251
''Highly Flammable''

386
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:42,657
I won't do that twice!

387
01:01:24,674 --> 01:01:27,939
''I'll wait for you
at the East tunnel. Shiyori.''

388
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,244
Snip, snip, snip...

389
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:43,354
Snip, snip...

390
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:09,140
Get in, quick!

391
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:31,170
''Shiyori''

392
01:02:47,256 --> 01:02:48,416
''The Final Chapter''

393
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:53,120
''Two Cell phones, in X-Cross.''

394
01:02:53,262 --> 01:02:57,426
''Caller: Mononobe Akira''

395
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:04,863
Please listen to me, Shiyori.

396
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:11,573
The person who engineered
our breakup,

397
01:03:12,715 --> 01:03:13,909
was actually Aiko.

398
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:20,411
This girl at work
had a crush on me.

399
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:24,018
She got Aiko to seduce me,

400
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,685
so that you and I would break up.

401
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:29,394
And I totally fell for it.

402
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:34,932
So, that time,

403
01:03:36,506 --> 01:03:38,269
you were kissing...

404
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:39,601
Shiyori!

405
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:44,077
Aiko.

406
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,978
But...

407
01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:55,556
I really wanted
another chance with you.

408
01:03:56,893 --> 01:04:00,021
So I asked Aiko
to set up this trip.

409
01:04:01,664 --> 01:04:04,861
So the person
who chose this village...

410
01:04:06,102 --> 01:04:07,865
should be...

411
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:09,936
Yeah, Aiko.

412
01:04:13,843 --> 01:04:15,743
I had to apologize
to you in person.

413
01:04:16,445 --> 01:04:17,309
I'm sorry.

414
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:23,315
I'm really in love with you...

415
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:26,115
Hey...

416
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:44,071
Hello?

417
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:49,807
I'm in Asamiya's car.

418
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:56,044
Oh, that's good.

419
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,185
He told me everything.

420
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,289
About what you did, too.

421
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:09,221
After all,

422
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:12,864
I was just a ''sort of' friend.

423
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:17,038
I always trusted you.

424
01:05:20,977 --> 01:05:25,209
I always believed
you were my friend.

425
01:05:27,116 --> 01:05:27,946
Shiyori...

426
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:31,281
You were always laughing
behind my back!

427
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:35,049
Thinking I was an idiot
for getting depressed.

428
01:05:35,191 --> 01:05:37,159
That's what you really thought.

429
01:05:37,293 --> 01:05:38,123
No!

430
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,160
Stop making a fool out of me!

431
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:44,391
You knew all about...

432
01:05:46,669 --> 01:05:48,034
this village's secret.

433
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:54,102
What do you mean?

434
01:05:55,044 --> 01:05:56,170
Don't act dumb.

435
01:05:58,781 --> 01:05:59,770
Murderer.

436
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:19,959
I'll protect you, Shiyori.

437
01:06:23,806 --> 01:06:24,932
Forever and ever.

438
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:53,062
Hello?

439
01:06:53,202 --> 01:06:55,636
Aiko, listen, this is important!

440
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:57,705
''Caller: Mononobe''

441
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:07,880
Hello?

442
01:07:08,017 --> 01:07:08,813
Are you okay?

443
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:12,182
I couldn't reach you for a while.

444
01:07:13,189 --> 01:07:14,247
Mononobe,

445
01:07:15,558 --> 01:07:18,083
ho exactly are you?

446
01:07:19,895 --> 01:07:21,692
My friend looked you up.

447
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:26,758
Your name's not listed at Jonan.

448
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:28,898
Oh, that's all.

449
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:33,002
But you said you go to Jonan.

450
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:34,904
I'm an instructor there.

451
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:39,370
Did she check out
the professors, too?

452
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:41,181
But...

453
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:44,116
''Welcome to Ashikari village''

454
01:07:46,822 --> 01:07:48,449
Hey, Asamiya, that's...

455
01:07:50,893 --> 01:07:53,828
Listen, Shiyori,
I have new information.

456
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,560
I found out who took
my sister to that village.

457
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:02,429
His name is Asamiya Keiichi.

458
01:08:03,973 --> 01:08:05,600
He's from that village.

459
01:08:32,802 --> 01:08:35,828
Hey, what happened? Shiyori!

460
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:38,002
What happened!

461
01:08:38,174 --> 01:08:40,972
Shiyori! Shiyori!

462
01:08:52,454 --> 01:08:54,718
Please, help Shiyori!

463
01:08:55,624 --> 01:08:58,787
If you're really her friend.

464
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:02,891
That's...impossible...

465
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,798
There's no way, no way!

466
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:14,538
You tricked me, Aiko.

467
01:09:19,181 --> 01:09:20,705
I'll tell Shiyori.

468
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,149
No, you can't.

469
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:24,752
Then, listen to me.

470
01:09:33,195 --> 01:09:34,184
Invite Shiyori...

471
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,560
to the hot springs.

472
01:09:39,668 --> 01:09:40,498
Hot springs?

473
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:46,399
I want to start over with her.

474
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:52,078
I know a sweet spot.

475
01:09:54,383 --> 01:09:58,012
It's Ashikari hot springs.
Amazingly secluded.

476
01:10:32,254 --> 01:10:36,315
You're not tricking me, are you?

477
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:43,230
I can really trust you, right?

478
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:13,327
Lucky Shiyori...

479
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:13,039
It is time to commence...

480
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:19,616
the ritual of...

481
01:13:20,889 --> 01:13:28,955
the living sacrifice!

482
01:14:32,294 --> 01:14:33,261
Wait!

483
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:35,230
Asamiya!

484
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:39,358
You're Asamiya, right!

485
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:03,718
Welcome to Ashikari village.

486
01:15:06,528 --> 01:15:07,517
But why!?

487
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,463
See the village I was born into?

488
01:15:16,038 --> 01:15:17,767
I was looking for you.

489
01:15:20,108 --> 01:15:22,099
Someone to be with me forever.

490
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:25,676
Someone who would live
with me here.

491
01:15:26,882 --> 01:15:29,077
I finally found you.

492
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:40,618
I fixed this up to live in Tokyo.

493
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:43,824
But I don't need it.

494
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:59,338
It hurts...

495
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:06,653
It hurts...

496
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:21,627
What perfect fine legs!

497
01:16:25,941 --> 01:16:28,808
Stop!

498
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,779
Stop it!

499
01:16:32,914 --> 01:16:34,108
I'll never let you go.

500
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:40,410
Stop.

501
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,825
Stop!

502
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:49,759
Get away!

503
01:16:50,432 --> 01:16:51,399
Stop!

504
01:17:05,347 --> 01:17:08,475
My own living sacrifice!

505
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:18,424
My very own living sacrifice!

506
01:17:21,196 --> 01:17:23,528
I got you!

507
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:32,732
I love you.

508
01:17:39,348 --> 01:17:40,679
Not so fast!

509
01:17:48,357 --> 01:17:49,517
Aiko!

510
01:17:51,393 --> 01:17:52,291
Shiyori!

511
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,276
Did you get the picture I sent?

512
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,613
Okay.

513
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:18,278
Yayoi!

514
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:22,620
Let Shiyori go!

515
01:18:25,026 --> 01:18:28,325
Otherwise, I'll send these
pictures all over the country!

516
01:18:36,905 --> 01:18:38,395
I'll destroy your little village!

517
01:18:39,241 --> 01:18:41,038
I'm serious, we'll wipe it out!

518
01:18:55,424 --> 01:18:58,518
Why? Why'd you come to save me?

519
01:18:59,127 --> 01:19:00,651
Wait, this is hardly the time...

520
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:02,195
Just answer me!

521
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:06,559
Answer me!

522
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:10,297
Because... I hadn't told you,

523
01:19:13,475 --> 01:19:15,204
how I truly feel.

524
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:20,148
You're not a ''sort of' friend.

525
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,851
To me, you're not!

526
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:35,320
Catch them!

527
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:08,156
Aiko!

528
01:20:10,732 --> 01:20:13,724
No way, Reika!

529
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,300
Who are you?

530
01:20:31,553 --> 01:20:33,817
Outta the way!

531
01:20:39,594 --> 01:20:40,891
Aiko!

532
01:21:21,536 --> 01:21:22,366
Aiko!

533
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:43,346
Shiyori, I'm late!

534
01:21:44,826 --> 01:21:46,088
Mononobe?

535
01:21:46,227 --> 01:21:47,057
Quick, get in!

536
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:48,993
Okay.

537
01:22:02,944 --> 01:22:05,208
My living sacrifice!

538
01:22:09,651 --> 01:22:10,618
I won't let you go!

539
01:22:13,355 --> 01:22:14,379
Aiko!

540
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:17,521
Let go!

541
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,560
Shiyori.

542
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:41,737
Hiuke Aiko!

543
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:49,713
Aiko!

544
01:23:01,503 --> 01:23:03,596
Quick, Shiyori!

545
01:23:12,747 --> 01:23:14,339
Follow them!

546
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:24,322
You can't escape!

547
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:34,957
Quickly!

548
01:23:36,938 --> 01:23:37,927
Hurry!

549
01:23:39,908 --> 01:23:41,375
My living sacrifice!

550
01:23:46,514 --> 01:23:48,482
Let's live together!

551
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,612
Live with me!

552
01:23:50,752 --> 01:23:51,776
Let go!

553
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:58,117
I love you!

554
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:13,533
Are you both all right?

555
01:24:18,546 --> 01:24:19,376
Yes.

556
01:24:20,281 --> 01:24:22,943
Thank God I made it in time.

557
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:27,685
Who's he?

558
01:24:30,058 --> 01:24:31,047
Mononobe.

559
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,796
He stayed up all night,
encouraging me on the phone.

560
01:24:40,502 --> 01:24:41,867
I get it.

561
01:24:42,771 --> 01:24:43,931
What?

562
01:24:44,572 --> 01:24:47,234
Mononobe!
Do you have a girlfriend?

563
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,774
Aiko!

564
01:24:49,344 --> 01:24:54,008
Who, me? I'm totally available.

565
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:21,106
It's dawn.

566
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:28,276
It was a long night.

567
01:25:30,318 --> 01:25:31,910
It really was.

568
01:30:05,226 --> 01:30:06,523
''Ashikari Hot Spring
is just a fiction.''

569
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:07,855
''It is not related to
any real village and place.''
