1
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:04,920
<i>What?</i>

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,380
<i>When?</i>

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,656
<i>But who is this?</i>

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,200
<i>What?</i>

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,927
<i>No</i>

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,173
No! But how can that be?

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,720
<i>Okay, okay</i>

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,314
<i>Yes</i>

9
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:50,233
Bye, mommy.

10
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:54,527
Sleep with the angels.

11
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:03,503
-Bye, daddy.
-I love you, birdie.

12
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,689
<i>What do you want?</i>
<i>Rafael! Tomás!</i>

13
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,794
<i>We didn't do anything!</i>
<i>We didn't do anything!</i>

14
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:06,301
Tomás! Get under the bed!
Hurry! Hurry!

15
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,179
<i>Tomás, Rafael!</i>

16
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:48,178
Children!

17
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,820
What happened!

18
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,979
Oh, my God.

19
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,149
Come in, boys!

20
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:23,978
<i>I just want a place</i>

21
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:28,412
<i>where I can live in peace</i>

22
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:34,548
<i>Underneath the frozen stars</i>

23
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,991
<i>A shining essence</i>

24
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,890
<i>And it is darkness</i>

25
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,793
<i>To watch the sun rise</i>

26
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:55,000
<i>Search for the source of the soul</i>

27
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,940
<i>Bathe in it every break of day</i>

28
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,545
<i>And when I say sky</i>

29
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,360
<i>I mean sky,</i>

30
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:15,362
<i>I mean blue skies</i>

31
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,432
-Rafael!
-Laura! What a surprise!

32
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,767
-I’m glad I found you.
-What’s up?

33
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,637
Have you seen Tomás?

34
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,709
No. Is something wrong?

35
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,472
I must see him.
I can’t find him.

36
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,508
I need to talk to you.

37
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:37,646
Fine. But I have a class now.

38
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:41,146
-Call me later.
-I’ll wait for you.

39
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,850
-Where?
-Here.

40
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,829
-It’ll be two hours.
-It doesn’t matter.

41
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,700
Come in.

42
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,341
Good morning.

43
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,575
We’ll continue...

44
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,113
analyzing Saint Thomas’ philosophy.

45
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,185
I hope you’ve read the texts.

46
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,980
-Any questions?
-No.

47
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,851
These truths revealed by faith...

48
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:21,092
and attainable through
the use of reason...

49
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,892
Saint Thomas calls them
“preambula fide”,

50
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:28,264
or gateways to faith.

51
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:34,171
But with respect to the
nondemonstrable Saint Thomas says:

52
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,303
“Salvation also depends on truths
that transcend reason...

53
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,713
and can only be reached...

54
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,546
through revelation”.
And to finish...

55
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,351
“The infinite nature of God...

56
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:49,521
is unattainable through reason,
because the finite...

57
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:53,453
cannot adequately
understand the infinite”.

58
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,129
Sir?

59
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,268
I have a question.
Maybe out of line.

60
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,232
Do you believe in God?

61
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:05,533
We’d have to define
what we mean by “God”.

62
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,374
I’ll rephrase that.

63
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,435
Within the context
of your teaching,

64
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:14,873
do you think that the cosmos
happens accidentally...

65
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,284
or that there’s an order, a higher
structure which makes it a whole?

66
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,250
That’s an interesting question.

67
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,326
But this is a Medieval...

68
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:27,156
Philosophy History class.

69
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,722
And I don’t think it matters
what I believe.

70
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:36,638
Nonetheless let’s say...

71
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,608
there is a school of sophisticated
and mature thinkers...

72
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,247
who suggest that such a question...

73
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:49,217
would denote a certain kind
of educational immaturity.

74
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,349
Couldn’t it be the opposite?
Couldn’t others think differently?

75
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,784
No, it doesn’t work like that.

76
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,329
Excuse me.

77
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,829
I was talking about coherence,
about exemplars.

78
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:10,529
To have a serious discussion...

79
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,537
we should agree
on some concepts.

80
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,110
It’s easy. If you tell
your child not to steal,

81
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,373
but he sees you stealing,
what’ll he do?

82
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:21,073
-I don’t know.
-Will you teach him...

83
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,175
what you are
or what you say you are?

84
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:26,251
I don’t have children.

85
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,023
-Thanks.
-Don’t mention it.

86
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:34,953
Shall we go?

87
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,912
You leave later every day.

88
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,849
I tell myself
“just one more minute.”

89
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,511
Meditate after work.

90
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,453
But at this time
the mind is so calm...

91
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,595
-There are bills to pay.
-Do you have any money?

92
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:44,524
-Yes.
-Show it to me.

93
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,292
Show what?
Don’t be rude.

94
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,961
Don’t lie to me.

95
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,904
You have no money.

96
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,043
-You’ll get paid on Monday
-But it’s Friday.

97
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,972
Don’t worry about me.
I’ll have some soup.

98
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:03,946
I worry about you.
You’re still growing.

99
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
I’ll ask for an advance.

100
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,756
Mendizabal Cereals.
Can I...?

101
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:19,698
Oh, it’s you.
Hold on.

102
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,402
-Rama, you have to go out.
-I’m just finishing.

103
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,406
I’ll finish it.
Come here, please.

104
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:29,511
Hang on a minute.

105
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:34,342
Francés Bank, Nación Bank,
tax office,

106
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,215
and go get Mr. Walter’s CDI.
Everything’s there.

107
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,345
Don’t lose anything
and don’t be late.

108
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:42,216
-Can I see Walter later on?
-Mr.

109
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,592
-Mr. Walter.
-What do you want?

110
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,519
-Something.
-What something?

111
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:48,664
A wonderful thing.

112
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,529
-Urgent.
-Later.

113
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,225
I’m sick of him.

114
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,685
I don’t know where to begin.

115
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,885
Generally, it’s good to begin
from the beginning.

116
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,063
It’s not that easy.

117
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,158
You don’t know your brother.

118
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,173
Am I disturbing you?

119
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:15,509
Banks, tax office, receipts,
there you are.

120
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,053
What is it?

121
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,889
-You took too long.
-It’s Friday.

122
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,487
-I have to report it.
-What?

123
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,595
I have no choice.

124
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:31,323
I just stopped for a minute.

125
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,197
Don’t shout at me!

126
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,901
I’m not shouting.
I’m sorry if you felt...

127
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,976
I didn’t feel so.
You shouted at me.

128
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,307
-Can I talk to Walter?
-Mr. Walter?

129
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,848
Yes. Mr. Walter.

130
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,716
No, he’s busy.
Can I help you?

131
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,248
-No.
-See you tomorrow.

132
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,021
See you on Monday.

133
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,494
Drink, drink, drink!

134
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,170
I love you.

135
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:23,113
-Up to the sky? And back?
-And back.

136
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,947
Thanks a lot to “Club 69”!

137
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,543
A big hand!

138
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:37,287
On this night
of grace and abundance...

139
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,695
we’re in the hands of...
Power DJ!

140
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,047
You do know him,
but not well enough.

141
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,221
Because...

142
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,795
you think that he’s naive,

143
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,534
that he is an idiot,
and it’s not so.

144
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,006
What’s happening to him
is intense.

145
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,003
-What do you mean?
-His sensitivity.

146
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,281
Your brother
isn’t an ordinary person.

147
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,782
-Maybe.
-I mean...

148
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,254
the dimension of his search.
It isn’t normal.

149
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,683
He’s searching for his father.

150
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,486
The dimension and intensity
of his search is proportional...

151
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,522
to the violence
with which they took him

152
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,693
Was your father
an extremist, too?

153
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,337
In those days,

154
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,301
if you were going against murdering,
you were an “extremist”.

155
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,169
I didn’t mean that.

156
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,109
How did he manage his affairs?
What was he like?

157
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,680
Just normal. He was a Buddhist,
but he was a normal guy.

158
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,879
He worked, he had a family
he loved, my mother and us.

159
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:48,913
He was very religious,
but you never noticed it.

160
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,159
I don’t know
what you’re getting at.

161
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,990
This situation is frightening me.

162
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,427
-What has you so scared?
-That he’ll go away. I don’t know.

163
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,967
Go where?

164
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:07,067
Your brother could die
in that bullshit posture!

165
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,672
God! God has forgiven us.
In his mercy, he’s looked upon us.

166
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,486
Tonight we welcome
a band of monks. Zen monks.

167
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,889
I don’t know
where they come from.

168
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:26,253
Right here, in “The Cave”,
I am delighted to present...

169
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,522
the Zen monk, Herman,
and his band, “No Satori”.

170
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,277
-Who are you?
-Laila.

171
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,081
Hi.

172
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,909
There’s someone there.

173
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,300
Tom.

174
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,340
Tom. Are you okay?

175
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,994
Ten pesos.

176
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:53,170
-Tomás?
-Give me ten pesos, please.

177
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:57,376
Give me ten pesos, please.

178
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,216
Don’t get upset.
I don’t understand you.

179
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,422
I’m trying really hard.

180
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,391
-What is it you don’t understand?
-This is a waste of time.

181
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,121
What’s up?

182
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,959
-Help me, please.
-But you must tell me...

183
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,693
I need your help.

184
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,868
What the fuck is going on?

185
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:47,153
And in the house
where they gave him food,

186
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,559
they also planted seeds.

187
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:53,531
And he walked and walked
and soon he was older.

188
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:57,200
One day he got to the sea.
And he had to stop there.

189
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,732
You can’t walk on the sea.

190
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:01,973
-Hello.
-Hi.

191
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,203
-Where shall I put it?
-Back there.

192
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,448
I have to charge you for it.

193
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,115
-What did Gerardo say?
-He said no more than five...

194
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,711
or I’ll have to pay for it.

195
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,187
Hold on, hold on.

196
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:19,485
Don’t go. Here.

197
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,997
You know what?
I’ll charge you eight. I’ll pay two.

198
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:30,032
You’re a fine person.

199
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:47,248
Let’s go, princess.

200
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:49,317
I don’t believe a word you say.
I don’t believe you.

201
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,491
Look at me. I’m a nice guy.

202
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,097
-No.
-Just a little bit.

203
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,812
You know what that is?

204
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,671
-A stolen kiss.
-No way!

205
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:24,251
-Mom.
-How are you?

206
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,327
-Fine.
-How did it go with Carlos?

207
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:32,056
You go out with the most sought
after hunk in Argentina...

208
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:34,894
-and you’re not gonna tell me?
-No.

209
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:41,169
You’re still hung up on that kid.
He’s no good.

210
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,067
What are you talking about?

211
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,270
You’re always suffering.

212
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:48,408
You see?
We can’t live together.

213
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:52,984
- You see?
-He’s kind of... silly.

214
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:56,786
Where is he an office boy?
He was just here.

215
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,491
-What? Who?
-Tobías.

216
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,656
-Why didn’t you tell me?
-I’m telling you now.

217
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:09,060
-What did he say?
-What would he say? Nothing.

218
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,934
-Tomás!
-Not again!

219
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:20,878
Hi! What’s wrong?

220
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:25,352
What is it?

221
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:29,588
Tell me.
What’s up with you?

222
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,290
It’s not easy to be with him.
It’s hard to be with someone...

223
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,835
who doesn’t talk,
who doesn’t like to go out,

224
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:46,263
or to go dancing,
who doesn’t like sex.

225
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,407
Nothing, you know?

226
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,179
He reads one book. Only one.
And all he wants to do...

227
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,342
is talk about God constantly.

228
00:23:57,986 --> 00:24:00,682
I love him, but it isn’t easy.

229
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:07,521
But if he saw you with that guy
it’s normal to not want to see you.

230
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,188
-But if you saw you with that guy...
-That’s not it.

231
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,357
-He saw you with another guy!
-It's something else. I know!

232
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,704
His phone’s cut off.

233
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:26,276
Cut off? Where is he?

234
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:28,739
I don't know!

235
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:33,987
-Have you got the bills?
-No.

236
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,651
You see? Here.

237
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,196
-You’re very worried.
-I’ll get paid today.

238
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,001
Buy some clothes...

239
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:50,438
some paints, a canvas...
You like painting.

240
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:55,509
Go on, Tomás.
Enjoy yourself for once.

241
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,252
The decision’s already been made.

242
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,050
I live alone with my grandma.
I support her.

243
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,548
Do you live alone
or with your grandma?

244
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:14,994
-I live with my grandma.
-I’m really sorry.

245
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,458
You should’ve
thought of that before.

246
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:22,365
What? What should I have thought?
What do you mean?

247
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,129
Shall I call security?

248
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,611
It’s okay.

249
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:36,784
-Thank you.
-Don’t mention it.

250
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,306
He went neither to the funeral
nor to the cremation.

251
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,072
He told me...

252
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:16,416
she wasn’t there anymore and
a few other stupid things.

253
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:20,481
And he left it all to me,
as always.

254
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,888
You don’t see it.

255
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,627
You really don’t see it.

256
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,922
Tomás is a saint.

257
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,371
Your brother’s a Buddha.

258
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,174
So what’s he doing
in this neighbourhood?

259
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,403
You know what?
I just can’t do this.

260
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,711
Look at the state you’re in.
You’re not OK.

261
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:56,153
I’ll try to find him. I’ll call you
tomorrow or the next day.

262
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:58,249
Find him!

263
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:06,194
-Professor Rama? Professor Rama?
-Yes.

264
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,930
How are you?
Do you have a minute?

265
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:12,067
-No. But go ahead.
-I’m an editor...

266
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,108
for Longseller.
I’d like to publish your book...

267
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,667
on postmodernism and ecology.

268
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,372
If that’s okay with you.

269
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,312
If you have a minute,
I’ll tell you about it.

270
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,309
I’m busy now, but what was
the name of the publisher?

271
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:26,183
Longseller,
an important publisher.

272
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,949
Does it specialize
n Philosophy?

273
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:30,655
Not exactly.

274
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,716
But it has circulation
in Europe, Latin America...

275
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,828
I’ll leave you this brochure...

276
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:41,769
and my card. And if you want you
can call me and I’ll fill you in.

277
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,231
-Okay.
-Great.

278
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:43,087
<i>Tomás! Tomás! Tomás!</i>

279
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,724
<i>Get under the bed Hurry!</i>.

280
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,833
Tomás!

281
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,464
Tomás!

282
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:31,311
-Hello. You’re...
-Yes.

283
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,279
-How are you?
-Fine, fine.

284
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:36,711
Do you know if Tomás is in?

285
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:39,153
-Doesn’t he answer?
-No.

286
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,622
Maybe he knows you’re calling,

287
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:46,889
and he doesn’t want to let you in.
What’s your name?

288
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:50,122
-Rafael. I’m his brother.
-Yes, I know.

289
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:53,927
You’re a good man.
But you’re a real asshole.

290
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:59,034
I really need to see him.

291
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,004
Can you open the door for me?

292
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:05,412
-Do you think he is dead?
-What? No.

293
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,974
It’s all right. Come in.
You’re a good man.

294
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:12,379
You can fix the asshole part.

295
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:17,022
Maybe. I’m not so sure myself.

296
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,193
Thanks.

297
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,068
Laura called by yesterday.

298
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,714
How long have you been here?
Like this?

299
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:46,945
I don’t know. Awhile.

300
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,760
-What are you gonna do?
-With what?

301
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,191
With your life.

302
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,491
Not run away anymore.

303
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,269
I mean for a living.

304
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,936
I don’t care.

305
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,810
I can’t believe...

306
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:15,850
I’m asking you this.
I can’t believe it.

307
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,087
Shall we go for a walk?

308
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,582
For a walk? It’s 3A.M.

309
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:29,190
Come on.
You...You’re good, man.

310
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:32,199
What did you hear?

311
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,197
Are you afraid of madness?

312
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:45,178
Not usually. A little today.

313
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:52,919
-You?
-I always was, but not anymore.

314
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:58,285
-Isn’t this dangerous?
-No.

315
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:04,594
Are you eating well?

316
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,165
How can I tell you?

317
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:11,772
Tell me what?
Are you eating or aren’t you?

318
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:15,299
Can you understand
the benefit of fasting?

319
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:18,376
You’re not in Tibet,
this is Buenos Aires.

320
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:22,340
You were born
and educated here.

321
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,817
You were fed in a normal way.

322
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:26,478
You just can’t cut off the supply.

323
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:29,489
It’s not about eating or not.

324
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,851
There are other sources.

325
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,453
Stop fucking around, Tomás!

326
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,032
Electricity has been cut off?

327
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:45,036
Don’t “sources” tell you maybe
you’re a little mistaken?

328
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,242
I never knew such calm.

329
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:51,911
Such sweetness.

330
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,638
I look at you
and I see you going under.

331
00:33:56,184 --> 00:34:00,177
The monkey sees the fish
in the water and suffers.

332
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,222
He thinks his world is the only one.

333
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:07,487
The real one. The best.

334
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,865
He suffers because he’s good
and feels compassion.

335
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:17,435
He sees the fish and says:
“It’s drowning”.

336
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:19,969
“It can’t breathe”.

337
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,573
He takes it out of the water
and thinks: “I’ve saved it”.

338
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:30,579
But the fish
writhes in pain and dies.

339
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:35,656
That’s why I showed you the dream.

340
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:39,689
You can’t put the sea
into your head.

341
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,396
It’s a bucket.

342
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,535
I don’t feel well.

343
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,541
I don’t feel well at all.

344
00:34:57,946 --> 00:35:01,006
-Did you hear that?
-What?

345
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,486
They must be injured!

346
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,490
Fucking hell!

347
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:14,187
Look what you’ve done!

348
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,761
Are you blind? You’re blind!

349
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,664
Are you the king of the road?

350
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:23,568
-Son of a bitch!
-Come here, you asshole!

351
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:32,012
Stop! Stop!

352
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,153
-Look at your little girl.
-That’s my car.

353
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,452
-Exchange insurance data.
-Insurance my ass!

354
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,532
Aren't you insured?

355
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:22,425
-How are you?
-Hello.

356
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:24,328
Take a seat, please.

357
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,467
-Everything okay?
-Yes. And you?

358
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:28,468
Fine. I’m happy.

359
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:33,562
-Tea or coffee?
-Coffee.

360
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,267
Coffee for him, tea for me.

361
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:40,979
-Are you Rafael Rama?
-Yes.

362
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,183
I’m doing a paper
on your thesis.

363
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:48,012
I loved it. And also
your essay on Spinoza.

364
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:52,049
-Great.
-You know why I liked it?

365
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:55,958
-It doesn’t matter.
-It was so simply put.

366
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,499
You get right
to the heart of it.

367
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:04,437
It’s a great pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.

368
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:09,337
-Thank you.
-Sorry. I’ll be right back.

369
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:12,606
-Sorry.
-It’s fine.

370
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,144
-It’s a good sign.
-What?

371
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,283
That someone, out of the blue,
confirms my offer.

372
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:26,653
Not out of the blue.
She studies here, at the university.

373
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:29,954
-What’s your offer?
-Yes.

374
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,156
It’s been accepted
by the management.

375
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,762
I just need your consent.

376
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,525
-It’s not so bad.
-It’s very good.

377
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:05,623
A little New Age.
The publisher, I mean.

378
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,165
It covers a lot.
It’s a big company.

379
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,731
Today there’s a presentation...

380
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,832
of our primary cultures collection.

381
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,842
We’re launching the Tobas texts.
If you’d like to go...

382
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,444
Well, let me think it over.

383
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,688
-Okay.
-Okay.

384
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:32,023
-Thanks.
-No, thank you. It was a pleasure.

385
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:35,959
-I’ll try to come this evening.
-Great.

386
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:40,259
-Bye.
-Thanks.

387
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:47,873
Don’t be rude, Laura.
Answer the phone.

388
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:51,435
Lucy, Lucy, don’t worry, it’s OK.

389
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,672
Yes, I’ll put heron now.

390
00:38:56,717 --> 00:39:00,676
He knows you’re here.
You can’t do this to me.

391
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:14,359
-Carlos.
-Laura! How are you, princess?

392
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,769
Listen. I don’t want to be rude,

393
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,864
but I’m not interested in you.

394
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:23,469
My mother insists but it all
seems very stupid to me.

395
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:27,544
Thank you for being so chivalrous
but this is a waste of time.

396
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:31,376
I have to go now.
Thanks for listening. Bye.

397
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:45,057
Open up, Tom.
Please, open.

398
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:55,539
-Hello.
-Excuse me.

399
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,044
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

400
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,105
-You live next to Tomás, right?
-Yes, I do.

401
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:05,618
-Have you seen him?
-Not for some time.

402
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,021
When did you last see him?

403
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:13,754
I don’t know.
Three weeks ago.

404
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,896
Thank you.

405
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:24,062
-No. It was my pleasure.
-Thanks.

406
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,482
He’s left me.
Hasn’t he?

407
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,947
I think this goes
way behind you.

408
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:45,920
He’s in a bad way. It’s serious.
He’s very week.

409
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:52,865
We shouldn’t panic but he’s going
to need psychiatric help.

410
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:57,300
We should see how we stand legally.

411
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:59,429
-Legally?
-To get him out...

412
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,775
Legally nothing.
That’s got nothing to do with it.

413
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,602
-Really?
-Not legally.

414
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:10,583
And what shall I do?
Let him die?

415
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,920
He’s my only family.

416
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:18,292
He knows what he’s doing.

417
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,398
He hasn’t eaten in two weeks.

418
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:29,528
-It’s not the first time.
-Does no one ever tell me anything?

419
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,807
Has he never gone
into your dreams?

420
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:46,218
He told me once about a dream,
but it was a coincidence.

421
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:13,673
He’s always doing it.

422
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,741
What’s the point of it all?

423
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,015
Liberation.
To escape rebirth.

424
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,719
He says being conscious
of the reality of God...

425
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:32,322
is the result of many
disciplined lives.

426
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,935
I’m sorry, but what you’re saying
is embarrassing.

427
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,775
Such an extreme search,
so many disciplined lives,

428
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:45,641
but he can’t manage
basic social interaction.

429
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:49,440
Isn’t it a bit absurd?

430
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:52,576
You don’t understand,
yet you judge?

431
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,051
Do you think everything
can be turned into a parking lot?

432
00:42:58,893 --> 00:43:00,622
That’s not so.

433
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,993
Listen. I’m very late for...

434
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:09,093
Don’t worry, I’m going. But I want
to ask you something important.

435
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:16,232
Open your heart, Rafael.
And give him time.

436
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:35,785
-Laila?
-They’re about to start.

437
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:41,224
I’m looking for...

438
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:52,874
-First time?
-Yes.

439
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:54,744
On the cushion.

440
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:34,449
It’s the story of our chief...

441
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:38,047
Metzoboché.

442
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:41,059
He wasn’t just an ordinary person.

443
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,397
He spoke to the lightning,
to the wind...

444
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:51,902
-Hello. Sol Blanc?
-I think she’s left.

445
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,165
But have a look in the back.

446
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:55,673
Thanks.

447
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:02,644
<i>.so people know about him</i>

448
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:04,908
<i>An unforgettable story for us</i>

449
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:07,983
Count on us
for any help we can give you...

450
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:11,546
and I thank you deeply.

451
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:14,517
Thank you, Clemente.
Thank you.

452
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:19,692
-I’m so tired.
-Great.

453
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:23,503
-Yes, really great. I’m happy.
-Have you eaten?

454
00:45:24,205 --> 00:45:26,571
-No.
-Can I invite you to dinner?

455
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,009
We can cook something...

456
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:30,703
in my house.

457
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:32,507
-Okay.
-Thanks. Really, I’m about to drop.

458
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,809
Come on, this way.

459
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:11,975
Did you want to ask me something?
-Yes. I’m looking for Laila.

460
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:15,381
Laila? She went to the temple.

461
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:19,488
-The temple?
-Yes. She went to see the Master.

462
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:28,901
-Are you OK? Do you feel all right?
-Yes.

463
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,804
Why philosophy?

464
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,443
Well, my mother in part...

465
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,050
My brain came preprogrammed.

466
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:56,090
And then, the search
for the truth, for the self,

467
00:46:56,497 --> 00:46:58,556
what it is, what it isn’t...

468
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:03,325
Everything that begins to mean less
as the years go by.

469
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,932
And you?

470
00:47:08,475 --> 00:47:10,500
For the work.

471
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,407
And to find some professor,
publish his work...

472
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,141
If he’s good looking,
all the better.

473
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:48,777
The sauce is burning.

474
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,487
-Do you want your glass?
-Okay.

475
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:06,822
Here.

476
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:15,372
-Maradona?
-A Hindu saint.

477
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,271
He’s an incarnation
of the divine.

478
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,815
He refers to himself as divine?

479
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,841
He says we are all divine.

480
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,917
-Great.
-Give everything, take nothing,

481
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,517
serve everyone, be nothing.

482
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:41,496
-How sophisticated.
-No.

483
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:44,634
-You’re strange.
-Why?

484
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,706
Those preachers are normally...

485
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,674
for simple minds.
I don’t know...

486
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,307
Artaud, Baudelaire,
Nouvelle Vague and Sai Baba don’t...

487
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:04,251
So wide ranging, so open.

488
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:06,224
It’s not all about the mind.

489
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,686
-No?
-No.

490
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:12,723
What else is it all about?

491
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:18,204
Sometimes the heart,
sometimes the body.

492
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:23,107
Have you ever been
in the presence of a great Master?

493
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:31,873
Yes. I had one once.
A chess master.

494
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:36,020
When I was seventeen.
A great master.

495
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:39,125
Why? You’ve been to India?

496
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,221
Yes, I’ve been there.

497
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:46,388
That’s the problem between
Western and Eastern philosophies.

498
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,492
What’s the problem?

499
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:53,404
That Western philosophy
is theory...

500
00:49:53,474 --> 00:49:55,669
without practice.

501
00:49:55,743 --> 00:50:00,043
For example, a man can teach virtue
and live in vice.

502
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:04,582
Or teach Ethics...

503
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:06,686
but be a corrupt swindler,

504
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:08,822
and no one can say he isn’t
a great theorist.

505
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:12,085
And theorists
constantly regurgitate...

506
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:14,093
what others said
about criticisms of others.

507
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,629
Eastern philosophy
is based on practice.

508
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:21,634
It’s born in the doing.
It’s practical and coherent.

509
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:25,065
It doesn’t fill books
explaining the scent of a rose.

510
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:28,130
It tells you where to find it,
smell it, and figure it out.

511
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,908
I think...

512
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,978
you have an unbalanced view
of both sides.

513
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:40,815
You omit historical facts...

514
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:43,316
that can’t be dismissed.

515
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,585
-Like what?
-Like the constant genocides...

516
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,891
carried out in the name of God.

517
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,624
That’s the stupidity
and brutality of man.

518
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:56,535
You’re identifying divine energy
with the church.

519
00:50:56,603 --> 00:51:00,061
-They’re totally different.
-And where is divine energy?

520
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:04,235
Christians who kill Moslems.

521
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:07,977
Moslem who kill Jews.
Jews who kill Palestinians.

522
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:12,114
Hindus starving to death.
Is that your Eastern coherence?

523
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,716
We’re talking
about different things.

524
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:18,925
I’m sorry.

525
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:24,654
But I’m sick
of spirituality and mysticism.

526
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:33,102
The military dictatorship
took and murdered my parents.

527
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:41,573
And I’ve always wondered...
where was God?

528
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,751
Where was God
when they took them...

529
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:48,615
in front of
my four-year old brother?

530
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:56,859
There is no concept in the universe
that seems more abhorrent,

531
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,264
deceptive and deliberately
created to cheat people...

532
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:05,264
than the concept
and the idea of God.

533
00:52:08,175 --> 00:52:09,733
Excuse me.

534
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:15,872
I’m sorry.

535
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:18,949
I’m leaving.
