166
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,974
Captain, the three of us
chipped in.
We wanted to give you this.

167
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,839
<i>(O'Neill)
It's a little something
to say thanks.</i>

168
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,176
Krieg picked it up.
At a shop in Singapore.

169
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,079
Wrapped it myself.
Did you?

171
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,483
You know, someone once sent me
a strip-o-gram.

172
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,286
I spent about a half an hour
running around my room
trying to get...

173
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,953
a nude geisha girl
back into the box.

174
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,589
<i>Thanks. I think I'll pass.</i>

175
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,361
<i>How did he know what it was?
'Cause it was your idea, Ben.</i>

176
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,535
He probably just started in
the sewer and worked his way
back up from there.

177
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,142
<i>Hello, Lucas, 
it's good to see you again. </i>

178
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,081
<i>I apologize that once again, 
I can't be spending
the holidays with you. </i>

179
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,378
<i>But I spoke to your mother, 
and she assures me
that you're doing well... </i>

180
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,285
<i>and that you're growing up, 
and... </i>

<i>[sighing]</i>

182
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,883
<i>Anyway, I can't wait till
this project is finished... </i>

183
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,986
<i>so that we can spend
some time with each other. </i>

185
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,291
Yeah, right.

<i>You missed my goodbye speech.
I'm sorry.
I had other stuff to do.</i>

<i>You don't want
to go back, do you?
Would you?</i>

192
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,218
<i>Look at what
you've done for me.</i>

193
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,322
<i>Now everybody's saying goodbye
and giving you
presents and stuff.</i>

194
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,459
<i>It's like
a bad birthday party.</i>

195
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,763
<i>Don't worry.
I didn't get you anything.</i>

196
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,965
<i>Well, that's all right.
You don't have to do that.</i>

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,072
<i>There will be another tour.
You don't have to
leave seaQuest. </i>

198

205

That was my Christmas present.

206
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,668
<i>But it's the thought
that counts, right?</i>

207
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,375
<i>Do you want me to call him?
No, that's all right.</i>

208
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,056
<i>But if you do,
tell him I said, "hi."</i>

Dr. Wolenczak,

Not now.

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,678
<i>It's a Capt. Bridger

<i>Is his son all right?
Well, yes. </i>

215
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,228
<i>He's fine.
Good. Tell him "thank you"...</i>

216
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,730
<i>but I can't speak to him
right now.</i>

217
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,562
<i>He can't talk to you
right now.</i>

218
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,467
<i>It's quite important. 
He says it's important.</i>

219
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,433
<i>Not now!
He'll call you back.</i>

220
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,011
What a dad.

<i>they're all giving me

228
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,029
I know. This is lovely.

<i>I think I'd be very jealous
if anyone else saw you
looking like this.</i>

230

May I kiss you, Doctor?
Of course, Captain.

231
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,662
<i>I know it's a lot of money,
but we didn't get into this
for money.</i>

232
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,034
I did.
Honey?

233
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,733
Please.

234
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,507
Ben, how did you figure
there was money in this?

235
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,380
<i>I guess I should have read
the seaQuest
career opportunities brochure.</i>

236
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,543
They offered you
a lot of money?
Well, yeah, but...

237
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,120
<i>I don't see myself
on the bridge
of a supertanker.</i>

238
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,993
I could see myself there.
You need discipline
to run a ship, Ben.

239
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,427
I am disciplined.

240
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,362
[clearing throat]
So, Katie...

241
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,698
what are you going to do?

242
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,466
<i>I have been approached
for a captain's position
on a supertanker, too.</i>

243
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,030
No way, which one?

244
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,735
<i>The H.R. Clinton
registered out of Delaware.</i>

245
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,707
<i>That's the one
I was asked to captain.</i>

246
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,850
<i>Maybe they thought
you'd say no.
I haven't said no.</i>

247
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,910
But you could afford to.

248
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,980
<i>I don't know how to turn down
$400,000 a year.</i>

249
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,425
[laughing]
$400,000.

250
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,729
(Katie)
Yeah.

251
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,625
They offered you $400,000?
Yes.

252
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,092
They only offered me $300,000.

253
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,571
<i>Maybe they're willing
to pay more for a woman.</i>

254
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,835
Women make better captains.

255
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,335
<i>That is purely subjective.
It's a statistical fact.</i>

256
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:45,279
All things being equal,
women make better captains
of non-combat vessels.

257
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,842
A woman at the helm
has a calming effect
on her crew.

258
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,847
<i>Well, Ben,
there's another reason
you'll never captain a ship.</i>

259
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,623
<i>Don't write me off so quickly.
I could be a woman.</i>

Lucas,
the chances of survival...

494

<i>I can't risk
sending anyone over there.
It's suicide.</i>

496
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,532
So maybe I die now
instead of a little bit later.

Will you please
get on the launch?
