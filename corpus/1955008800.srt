1
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,789
Can you just listen up?

2
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,586
Guys?

3
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,865
We got 2,000 feet,
600 vertical meters

4
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,910
to Camp Four.

5
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,511
It's roped all the way,
so I know you can make it.

6
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,426
Once we get to
the yellow band,

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,700
we're gonna regroup,

8
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,985
put on the masks,
turn on the gas.

9
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,710
Make sense?

10
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,180
325 dollars a bottle.

11
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,261
For oxygen?

12
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,501
That's daylight robbery!

13
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,901
Yeah, well, he's
cornered the market, he's got it.

14
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,904
He reckons there's gonna be
20 teams at Base Camp this season.

15
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,020
Twenty teams?

16
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,471
I mean, with all
the Sherpas and porters,

17
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,941
it's gonna be
a squeeze up there.

18
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,026
Well, that's a scrum on
the ropes, right there.

19
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,228
What is this?
It's Helen's.

20
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,382
It's a little
decoration for the mess tent.

21
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,461
You can wear them
in your hair.

22
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,541
I'll have that.
Thank you.

23
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,503
Okay, I got some news.

24
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,989
We got Krakauer.

25
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,903
You stole him
from Scott Fischer?

26
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,311
No, he made up
his own mind.

27
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,831
Good job, Rob!

28
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,827
How much is he
paying you, Rob?

29
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,267
Well, he's only
paying for his airfare

30
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,344
but we get 5,000
words in the magazine

31
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,229
and our picture on
the front cover. Huh?

32
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,906
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

33
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,311
Well, if you get
him to the top.

34
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,586
If?

35
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,389
If? How can you
say that to me?

36
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,586
There you go.
You all right?

37
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,264
Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.

38
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,944
Hey!
Hello!

39
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,229
You all right?
Oh, yeah, how are you?

40
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,665
Me? I'm good.
Oh, look at you!

41
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,703
I know, I'm big.

42
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,703
Here you go.
You good?

43
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,669
Yeah, you know,
I'm just gonna miss you.

44
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,946
Come on.

45
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,663
- Let's go, Guy.
Mmm-hmm.

46
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,865
Just go careful,
all right?

47
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,430
It's...
Please, my love.

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,783
Come on.
Please don't worry.

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,743
It's just the doing
nothing back here

50
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,151
that's making me worry.

51
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,261
You're not doing nothing.

52
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,626
No, but...

53
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,826
What?

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,223
It's the waiting for you.

55
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,942
For him.
Her.

56
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,505
Her.
Her.

57
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,985
Just be back for
the birth, Rob Hall.

58
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,144
You try and stop me.

59
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,991
<i>This is a final call</i>

60
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,064
<i>for Air New Zealand
Flight 7419 to Kathmandu.</i>

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,381
Okay, I love you.
Go, or I'll cry.

62
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,700
Go.

63
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,186
Yeah.

64
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,826
That all you got?

65
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,226
Yeah, that's it.

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,668
I think
we're over here.

67
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,341
Hey, what outfit
you guys with?

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,460
Uh, Adventure Consultants.

69
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,621
Ah, good. Me too.

70
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,826
Ah.
I'm Beck.

71
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,743
Beck Weathers.
Doug Hansen.

72
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,944
Jon Krakauer.
How you doing?

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,545
Good.
Are you, uh...

74
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,351
Krakauer from <i>Outside</i> magazine?
Yep.

75
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,501
Really?

76
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,662
What are you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

77
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,902
Little bit of both.
Hmm.

78
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,551
Well, I'll let you know
how the summit goes, okay?

79
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,384
No need.
I'll be there.

80
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,791
Ah, we'll see.

81
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,907
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

82
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,869
What, for work?
Yeah.

83
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,706
Uh, different things.
Carpenter, mailman.

84
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,669
Carpenter, mailman?

85
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,741
Yep.

86
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,151
Seriously,
you deliver the mail?

87
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,745
Yeah, I deliver the mail.

88
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,831
Mailman on Everest?

89
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,425
Hope so.

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,548
I like that.

91
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,384
Mailman on Everest.

92
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,701
There we go.

93
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,111
- Beck.
- Yeah?

94
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,501
You know he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year?

95
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,628
Who, Doug did?
Yeah.

96
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,822
That's pretty
high for a mailman.

97
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,347
Yep. Longs Peak, McKinley.

98
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,631
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

99
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,748
I know.
Well, how do you know that?

100
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,185
'89, right?

101
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,986
Oh!

102
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,705
You've done your research.

103
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,430
That's what we do.

104
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,747
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

105
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,868
A history made
famous by George Everest,

106
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,904
George Mallory,
Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary.

107
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,470
And Rob Hall!

108
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,310
Legends all of them!

109
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,070
That's right.

110
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,540
For those of you who
dare face their dreams,

111
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,906
Adventure Consultants
offers something

112
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,063
beyond the power of
words to describe.

113
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,508
And why don't we describe it
in the brochure?

114
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,222
Because it's mostly
just pain.

115
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,860
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth?

116
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,743
And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike,

117
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,822
and the odd missing toe.

118
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,466
There we go.

119
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,388
To put it simply,
guys, human beings

120
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,622
simply aren't
built to function

121
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,341
at the cruising
altitude of a 747.

122
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,068
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col

123
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,426
our bodies will be
literally dying.

124
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,468
And I mean
literally dying.

125
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,463
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

126
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,541
So the game is,

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,950
can we get you up to the top
and down to the bottom

128
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,385
before that happens?

129
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,189
- You sure can.
- Oh!

130
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,183
Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.

131
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,661
You might have noticed
a bit of the Lone Star State?

132
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,265
100% Texan
right here, people.

133
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,382
100% Texan.

134
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,183
You've met Mike Groom.

135
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,623
I'd like to introduce you
to Andy Harris.

136
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,304
- Harold.
- Our other guide out of Queenstown.

137
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,462
Taranaki, actually,
originally. <i>Kia ora.</i>

138
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,146
Helen and the rest of the team
are already on the way up to Base Camp.

139
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,427
They're setting it up
for when we get there.

140
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,945
Today's March 30, people.

141
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,022
I plan on going for
the summit May 10.

142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,626
It's been a lucky day for me
and Adventure Consultants

143
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,101
and the weather's usually
pretty stable around then.

144
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,341
So that means,

145
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,981
we have 40 days to train
your bodies and your minds

146
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,346
to go for it.

147
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,469
Now, I know there's a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room.

148
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,945
You wouldn't be
here without it.

149
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,990
Stu, K2, Broad Peak.

150
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
John Taske.

151
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,626
1,192 meters of
Mount Kosciuszko.

152
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,586
And... I mean,
Yasuko Namba.

153
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,180
Six of the Seven Summits
and the only woman.

154
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
There you go.

155
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,825
Let's make it seven.
Thank you.

156
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,461
But Everest, though, is another beast,
another beast altogether.

157
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,349
That's why you're here,
isn't that right, Dougie?

158
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,821
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

159
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,663
So, listen. Tonight, that's it from me.
Eat, drink, be merry.

160
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,105
Tomorrow, we trek.

161
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,748
We good?
You ready for this?

162
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,945
Dougie.

163
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,709
All right,
folks, hang on.

164
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,781
Okay.

165
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,100
That's it,
here we go, Colonel.

166
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,580
All right,
everybody, earbuds.

167
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,622
Take your seats,
buckle in, everyone.

168
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,701
Thanks, Mike.

169
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,543
Do or die.
Here we go.

170
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,781
Okay.

171
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,266
Can you believe it?

172
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,549
<i>Bravo 270 en route,
request Bravo 410.</i>

173
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,906
Keep 'em all
in a nice group.

174
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,106
Hey, guys,
take it easy.

175
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,830
- Yes, I'm ready.
- Ready.

176
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,629
We're kicking
it off, let's go.

177
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,543
You lead
the way, pal.

178
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,620
You all right?

179
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,826
Yes.

180
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,301
Guys, man wants to
see your climbing permits.

181
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,508
Need to see all your
climbing permits!

182
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,787
<i>Namaste.</i>

183
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,464
Thank you very much,
we'll see you on the way back.

184
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,190
Thank you very much.

185
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,462
All good?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you?

186
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,110
Yeah.
Hey, uh...

187
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,345
Thanks, Rob.

188
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,020
Thanks for what?

189
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,704
You know, the discount.

190
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,386
Well, you're working
three jobs, Doug.

191
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,461
It was the least
I could do, mate.

192
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,987
I know, you didn't have to do it,
though, and I appreciate it.

193
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,350
Let's just get you
to the top this time.

194
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,706
Yeah.

195
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,229
How you feeling, Beck?

196
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,505
Fair to middling.

197
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,469
Come on, buddy,
you can do it.

198
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,460
Thought I was gonna
acclimatize faster than this.

199
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,781
Uh, you'll be all right.

200
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,750
Darn critters.

201
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,221
Whoo!

202
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,503
Wow.
Yeah.

203
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,591
How close
did you get?

204
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,869
Well, I got real close
but it got late and I was

205
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,704
pretty shot anyways.

206
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,987
Well, I think I would
have made a run for it.

207
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,431
Every day I wake
up thinking that.

208
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,025
Then why didn't you do it?

209
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,431
'Cause I
turned him around.

210
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,865
Morning 15 at
the South Summit,

211
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,981
bad conditions,

212
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,666
we weren't gonna make
our 2:00 p.m. turnaround.

213
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,390
See, it's all good and well
to make the top, Beck,

214
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,827
but you pay me to
bring you down safely.

215
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,629
Remember that.

216
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,826
Okay.

217
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,864
What's eating him?

218
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,351
One of our Sherpas, Tenzing.
He had an accident.

219
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,184
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

220
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,629
Fell while fixing one of
the ladders on the Icefall.

221
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,829
It's not good.
They had to bring him down.

222
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,346
<i>Namaste.</i>

223
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,701
<i>Namaste.</i>

224
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,307
Congratulations, you all made it.
Welcome to Base Camp!

225
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,348
We got the United
Nations here this year.

226
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,940
Got the IMAX team,
South Africans.

227
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,024
And right up here

228
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,469
in the best spot of all

229
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,063
we have the Adventure
Consultants Base Camp.

230
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,501
Hey, Helen.
Hey. Hi, how are you?

231
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,624
Good to see you.
Thank you.
Welcome, nice to see you.

232
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,747
Hi, Rob.
Hey.

233
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,424
Well done,
you all right?

234
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,547
Yeah, good. You?

235
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,146
- Yeah, no, we're good.
- It looks good.

236
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,541
For those of you that haven't met,
this is Helen Wilton,

237
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,985
Base Camp manager.

238
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,587
She will be your mom
for the next few weeks.

239
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,580
Any problems, take it to
her and she'll sort it.

240
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,947
All right, well,
it's very nice

241
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,670
to finally meet
you all in person.

242
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,225
Ang Dorjee, come here.

243
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,984
This is Ang Dorjee,
everyone.

244
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,745
He's your climbing <i>sirdar,</i>
your lead Sherpa.

245
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,864
Hey, how are ya?

246
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,101
You speak English?

247
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,349
Better than you, Mr. America.

248
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,940
Bet you climb better than I do, huh?
Yeah.

249
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,701
Yeah?

250
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,985
Summited three times, Beck.

251
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,511
All right, all right.
I hear ya, I hear ya.

252
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,548
All right, well, there's
tea in the mess tent

253
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,827
when you've
dumped your sacks

254
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,745
and the comms
tent's down the back,

255
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,107
that's the cooking tent,
and over there

256
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,670
is the toilet.

257
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,781
It's a little bit drafty,
but just remember that

258
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,340
when the wind gets
up here, you've got

259
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,860
the same view that
George Everest did.

260
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,628
For those of you
who haven't used crampons before

261
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,509
the left and rights are marked
with an "L" and an "R,"

262
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,581
so you can't
get it wrong.

263
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,071
All right?
So, simple.

264
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,542
First of all, you push it into
the shoe with this.

265
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,784
Unbelievable.

266
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,545
If it isn't the mayor
of Base Camp!

267
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,464
Scott Fischer,
Mr. Mountain Madness.

268
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,781
In the flesh.

269
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,350
You want a cup?

270
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,742
Sit down, man.
Acclimatize!

271
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,030
Okay. I'm normally
a tea man myself,

272
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,465
but let's give it a go.

273
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,744
Thank you so much.

274
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,069
Wow. It's crazy
this year, eh?

275
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,981
I know, man.

276
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,666
Some idiot Kiwi goes and invents
Himalayan guiding

277
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,902
and look what happens.

278
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,586
Yeah, it didn't take you
too long to get in on the act.

279
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,662
Gotta make a living, man.

280
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,942
You went ahead and fixed the icefalls,
I see.

281
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,101
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,745
It's pretty messy up there this year.
Yeah?

283
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,310
Crevasses are pretty big.

284
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,348
Strung four or five
ladders across.

285
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,105
You used good
ropes though, didn't you?

286
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,901
You ready? Okay.

287
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,223
This is, um, April 7th,
about 10:30 a.m.,

288
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,301
this is Sandy Hill Pittman,

289
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,542
reporting for NBC
Interactive Media

290
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,306
and we are officially
at Everest Base Camp!

291
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,584
She one of yours?
Oh, yeah.

292
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,549
Someone went and
stole my journalist

293
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,588
so I had to get another one.
Hmm.

294
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,186
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer,

295
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,466
that's for sure.
Listen, just to be clear,

296
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,587
I didn't steal
your journalist.

297
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,707
Hey, man, it's all good.

298
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,101
<i>Outside</i> magazine
gave me a call.

299
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,705
Hey. Hey!
They gave me a call.

300
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,782
- Said they wanted to...
- It's all good, man.

301
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,146
They were gonna send
a journalist up the hill

302
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,463
and asked me if
I was interested.

303
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,142
It was his call
in the end.

304
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,110
All right, Caroline MacKenzie,
team doctor.

305
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,705
Why don't you
kick it off, Caro.

306
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,509
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Caro.

307
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,860
Hi there.

308
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,542
Sorry.
That's fine.

309
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,661
Um...

310
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,062
So Rob and Harold
and Mike will tell you

311
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,222
all sorts of stuff
about mountaineering,

312
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,268
but from a
medical standpoint

313
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,907
getting you to the top of Everest
is really about oxygen.

314
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,630
And the lack of it.

315
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,589
To give you the best
chance of summiting

316
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,310
you need to
prepare your bodies

317
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,950
for the thin air up there.

318
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,711
So, over the next month,
before the final ascent

319
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,704
you're gonna make three
partial acclimatizing ascents

320
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,021
returning here to
Base Camp after each one.

321
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,629
<i>The bad news is
that each ascent</i>

322
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,543
<i>begins and ends
with the Icefall.</i>

323
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,263
<i>I'm sorry, but there
is no way around it.</i>

324
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,263
<i>There are millions
of tons of glacial ice</i>

325
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,627
<i>continually moving
day and night.</i>

326
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,668
<i>You got seracs
the size of tower blocks,</i>

327
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,347
you got crevasses so deep
they probably don't even have a bottom.

328
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,861
It is not a place that
you wanna get caught hanging out in,

329
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,624
especially when
the sun hits it.

330
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,906
So we're gonna be
up nice and early

331
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,187
and through that
as soon as possible.

332
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,506
Now the Sherpas
have gone ahead

333
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,991
<i>and fixed the ladders
across the crevasses</i>

334
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,427
<i>and we've made it as
safe as we possibly can.</i>

335
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,707
<i>But that is not to say
that it is completely safe.</i>

336
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,071
<i>19 people have
died in that Icefall.</i>

337
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,061
Whoa!
Whoa! Hold on!

338
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,591
Steady.

339
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,866
You all right, Jon?

340
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,544
You all right?

341
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,906
- I'm good.
- Okay.

342
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,789
All right, steady up.
Whoo!

343
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,431
<i>So remember,
we're a team.</i>

344
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,104
<i>Let's look out for each other.</i>

345
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,189
<i>Look out
for hypothermia,</i>

346
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,991
<i>things like slurred speech
and irrational behavior.</i>

347
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,669
<i>I've seen hypoxic
climbers rip off</i>

348
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,390
<i>all their clothes
at 8,000 meters</i>

349
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,588
<i>because they're feeling hot.</i>

350
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,790
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

351
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,069
to the point of loss of motor
function and eventually death.

352
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,903
<i>And pulmonary edema,
which is your lungs filling with fluid</i>

353
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,022
<i>so you effectively drown.</i>

354
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,785
<i>The only cure is to get
down the mountain, fast.</i>

355
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,110
- All right, okay.
- All right, buddy.

356
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,626
<i>But it is not all
doom and gloom here, okay?</i>

357
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,543
<i>Myself and
the whole AC team are here</i>

358
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,429
<i>to make sure you get
up and down safely</i>

359
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,231
<i>and you will
acclimatize naturally.</i>

360
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,144
So why don't we all
give Caro a nice big thank you,

361
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,426
it's her
first time here.

362
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,467
- All right.
- Nice job.

363
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,831
Well done.

364
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,989
See, you want to
get on the regulator.

365
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,147
You want to
hear that hiss.

366
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,701
Connect your hose.

367
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,703
- Yasuko.
- Beck.

368
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,225
How'd you do, darling?
Okay.

369
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,904
- Good?
- Well done.

370
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,981
Can I get a hit of that?

371
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,108
Have a suck on that.

372
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,740
In a situation like this,
you just wanna

373
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,908
catch your breath,
throw it up to four.

374
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,947
You should start
feeling pretty good.

375
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,021
I can feel it already.

376
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,625
How did you boys go?

377
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,065
Hey.
Instant happiness.

378
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,188
- It's amazing.
- Very happy.

379
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,829
Doug, you okay?

380
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,500
Well, when we get
back to Base,

381
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,907
I want you to get Caro
to take a look at you.

382
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,943
- No. I'm all right, I'm okay.
- No, no.

383
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,110
And do me a favor,
spend your night on oxygen.

384
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,426
Yeah?
Yeah.

385
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,501
We got enough?

386
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,469
We got plenty.
All right.

387
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,707
Get some tea into ya.

388
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,183
Just lift your
shirt up a bit.

389
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,591
Thank you.

390
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,663
And take a deep
breath for me?

391
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,385
Just take one of those
in the morning

392
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,791
with a bit of water,
before breakfast.

393
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,589
Okay, thanks.

394
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,863
Right, Beck, you're up.
Sorry. Here, go for it.

395
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,190
Read it and weep.

396
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,583
Take it
easy, Doug.

397
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,549
Right, you can stop.
Yeah?

398
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,621
You're in
great shape, Beck.

399
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,701
I am in great shape.

400
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,063
- You are.
- Six days a week in the gym.

401
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,302
Ought to do it.
Your wife must love that.

402
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,381
Yeah, she does.

403
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,141
Oh, no. What's
the date today?

404
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,220
April 25th.

405
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,991
No!

406
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,430
I need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

407
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,706
You might wanna
look at this one first.

408
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,101
It came in for you
last night.

409
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,143
- Lord.
- What?

410
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,341
Can I use your sat phone?
Ooh!

411
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,900
Well, if this did come in last night,
it's an emergency.

412
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,584
It's 25 bucks
a minute, Beck.

413
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,741
Yep, fine.

414
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,060
No, this one's on us.

415
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,750
Seriously?

416
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,060
Thanks.

417
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,661
Rob!

418
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,906
- Beck?
<i>- Peach, it's me.</i>

419
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,470
What's happened?

420
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,065
<i>Nothing, nothing.
I'm fine.</i>

421
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,265
Where are you?

422
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,027
<i>Uh, I'm at Base Camp
right now.</i>

423
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,023
You're calling
me from Everest?

424
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,909
Yeah, it's
a satellite phone, honey.

425
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,348
<i>Oh, my God, how much is that costing?
What's the problem?</i>

426
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,751
There is no problem, Peach.

427
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,821
Uh...

428
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,384
I'm sorry,
we were up at Camp Two

429
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,623
and that's why I didn't
send you a fax yesterday.

430
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,910
Happy anniversary! Okay?

431
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,261
<i>How are the kids?</i>

432
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,466
Fine.

433
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
<i>Peach?</i>

434
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,631
Bub's here

435
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,905
doing his homework
in the morning, as per usual.

436
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,981
You wanna say
hi to him?

437
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,710
<i>Well, yeah, of course I do.</i>

438
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,861
Hang on.
<i>Okay.</i>

439
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,066
Say hi.
Hey, Dad!

440
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,141
<i>- Hey, bud!</i>
- Hi!

441
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,824
<i>I miss you, buddy.</i>

442
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,468
Oh! And Meg went
on her first date last weekend.

443
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,185
Well, you did!

444
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,308
<i>Wow! Really?</i>
Mmm-hmm.

445
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,504
Get off!
<i>Peach?</i>

446
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,508
I miss you, honey.

447
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,582
Mom? Mom?

448
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,310
<i>I miss the kids.</i>

449
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,346
A lot.

450
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,421
<i>Peach?</i>

451
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,424
Listen, I gotta get
the kids to school

452
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,229
so I gotta run.

453
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Okay.

454
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,221
<i>Yeah, go careful.</i>

455
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,141
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

456
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,190
Is Dad okay?

457
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,863
Just, he never calls.

458
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,309
I think he's scared.

459
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,341
Here, come in, mate,
come on!

460
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,188
- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

461
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,781
You don't dance,
you don't climb!

462
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,101
Come on, guys,
Beck Weathers!

463
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,382
No dance, no climb!
No dance, no climb!

464
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,901
Hey, man.
Breaking into the rations?

465
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,981
Yeah, you want some?

466
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,061
No. I'll wait
till we summit.

467
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,306
I don't know
about that, Neal.

468
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,829
We'll get there.

469
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,947
I'm excited.

470
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,784
Anyway, me
and Anatoli

471
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,510
are here to help you,
you know?

472
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,425
There's too much
competition, Toli.

473
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,304
We don't need competition
between people.

474
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,671
There is competition between
every person and this mountain.

475
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,387
The last word always belongs
to the mountain.

476
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,382
- Ang Dorjee!
- Yeah?

477
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,667
Stay there, Beck,
stay there.

478
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,143
Okay,
I'm coming down!

479
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,103
Harold, Mike,
this is Rob.

480
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,865
<i>Mike here.</i>
This isn't happening, guys.

481
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,869
Let's turn 'em around,

482
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,583
let's get 'em off the face and back down
to Base Camp. Turn around.

483
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,900
- Ang Dorjee, come on, we're going down.
- Okay.

484
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,026
My hand.

485
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,903
Okay, make
a fist again.

486
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,460
Keep clenching,
just keep the blood flowing.

487
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,229
What's going on, man?

488
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,780
We're still waiting
for the South Africans.

489
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,181
Taiwanese took forever as well.

490
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,784
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

491
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,704
Yeah, yeah. Your Yak
Fund money's coming.

492
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,706
You serious, man?

493
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,020
Come on, get a move on.

494
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,907
How long you been
waiting here?

495
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,186
Good 45 minutes.

496
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,421
Man, it's freezing.

497
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,508
- Yeah.
- It's stinging, huh?

498
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,230
Yeah. Right at the tips.

499
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,466
Hey, Rob, we gotta
get 'em over.

500
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,621
We're working on it.

501
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,429
He's
freezing, mate.

502
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,822
- Are you set?
- Clear.

503
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,744
- Sending him over, Mike!
- Yeah, all right.

504
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,143
Looking good, Beck.

505
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,745
Looking good.

506
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,380
That's it. No, head up,
mate, head up.

507
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,866
Steady yourself!

508
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,787
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

509
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,670
Little help?
Help! Help!

510
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,027
Mike, you good?

511
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,181
Are these ladders
gonna take two?

512
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,750
Yeah, I'll get a rope,
I'll belay you.

513
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,981
Just stay right
where you are, mate.

514
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,141
I can't pull myself up!

515
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,621
I'm gonna come out to you.

516
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,747
Okay.

517
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,821
You're good,
Beck, you're okay.

518
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,947
Got it for you.

519
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,146
Right, tie me
in, Scott, tie me in.

520
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,267
Come and get me!

521
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,751
- On belay?
- Got it. On belay.

522
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,106
Let's go.

523
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,581
Right, I'm coming out to you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

524
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,991
Nice and easy,
you're tied in, mate.

525
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,260
I can't
feel my hands.

526
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,546
You're looking good.

527
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,110
Grab me.
Beck, Beck, Beck.

528
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,188
Grab me!
Stay right where you are, mate.

529
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,500
I'm right here,
I'm coming to you.

530
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,503
I can't pull myself up!

531
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,820
I got ya.

532
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,951
You okay?

533
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,990
There's no guarantee
to the summit, I get it.

534
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,062
But to get killed
because I'm waiting in line

535
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,461
like I'm in
freaking Walmart.

536
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,902
That's not why I
paid you 65,000 dollars.

537
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,584
Now get me off of here.

538
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,144
That's it.
Plant your feet one at a time.

539
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,140
All right,
thanks for coming by.

540
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,180
Uh...

541
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,622
Look, Base Camp's,
you know, chockablock full this year, so,

542
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,748
I think it would
all benefit us greatly

543
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,026
by coming together
like this

544
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,387
and, you know, working out
some kind of plan and schedule.

545
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,791
What, like some
kind of rota?

546
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,947
Yes.

547
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,351
On Everest?

548
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,740
Everyone knows
Everest is a business

549
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,464
for you, Robert,
are you kidding?

550
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,666
What gives you
the right to tell us

551
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,741
when we can climb
and when we can't?

552
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,709
I'm not telling you, mate.
I'm asking.

553
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,700
If we know when everybody's
planning to summit, for instance,

554
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,787
you know, we can
avoid the chaos

555
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,908
that happened in
the Icefall today.

556
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,827
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10.

557
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,902
So are we, man!
Us too.

558
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,186
May 10.

559
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,430
Okay, that's bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the Hillary Step.

560
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,581
Yes, it is,
that's my point.

561
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,550
Look, this is ridiculous.
We're summiting when we want.

562
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
All right?

563
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,230
And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.

564
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,382
Ian, have you seen
how many people are here at Base Camp?

565
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,781
We're finished here.
Come on, guys.
Ian! Hey, man.

566
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,910
Oh, Rob!

567
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,065
- Ah! Come in, man!
- Hi.

568
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,101
Have a drink, Rob!
Come on, man.

569
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,864
<i>Na zdorovie.</i>

570
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,271
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

571
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,348
Can we have a word?
Yeah.

572
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,465
You feeling
a little crook, huh?

573
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,951
No, it's just a little...

574
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,749
Little touch of
the Delhi belly.

575
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,231
He means
Buddha belly.

576
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,950
Maybe Sandy's caviar.

577
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,830
I told you not to have
the Dom Perignon with it!

578
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,902
What's going on,
Roberto?

579
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,268
I don't like the look
of the crowds on the ropes.

580
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,780
I think we're gonna
have some trouble

581
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,788
once we get
above Camp Three.

582
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,180
I mean, you wanna top
it on the 10th, yeah?

583
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,790
Yeah.
So do I.

584
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,582
What, are you saying
we should team up?

585
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,662
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

586
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,585
Oh, man.

587
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,430
I don't know, man.
We have different styles, man.

588
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,431
All due respect, you're a hand-holder.
I mean, the best, but...

589
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,341
I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourself

590
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,900
you shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.

591
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,870
You guide your team,
I guide mine.

592
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,305
I'm just suggesting
that we work

593
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,740
with each other
instead of against.

594
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,511
The only way we both summit, mate,
is if we work together.

595
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,742
Particularly fixing the ropes.

596
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,349
It's gotta make sense.

597
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,187
Whoo-ie! Why not?

598
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,191
Yeah?
Yeah, I see the sense in it.

599
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,103
Good man.
That was all.

600
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,545
All right.

601
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,030
Who's gonna lead
when we get up there?

602
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,344
Rob. If I say I will
do it, it will be done.

603
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,541
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

604
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,621
You gotta work
with Ang Dorjee,

605
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,589
because we're
working together now.

606
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,862
I'm just saying,
if both of us...

607
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,908
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

608
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,826
Okay?

609
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,705
Ang Dorjee.

610
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,065
We're all professionals here.

611
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,421
We'll work together and
we'll get the job done. Yes?

612
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,547
All right.
Yeah.

613
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,385
We're planning on stashing,
what, eight bottles of O

614
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,700
up at the South Summit.

615
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,940
- Well, I'm not using O.
- What do you mean?

616
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,220
You're not
using oxygen at all?

617
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,426
Come on, man.
You know you want to.

618
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,945
English air.
Don't need it.

619
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,227
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

620
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,871
You have people's lives in your hands.
It's a job.

621
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,511
Never used it.
Never will.

622
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,907
Bigger problems
if you run out.

623
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,021
Okay.

624
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,071
I'll put some more
bottles of O up there.

625
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,860
All right, that'll be good.
All right.

626
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,701
Just so long as
you guys are clear.

627
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,145
If you work for me,
you use oxygen,

628
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,631
otherwise you
don't work for me.

629
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,145
You don't have to
ask, mate.

630
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,750
I've been up there
before without O's, Rob.

631
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,345
I don't need to
do it with clients.

632
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,582
All right, next
we have to fix ropes.

633
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,180
Yeah.
Particularly above the Lhotse Face.

634
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,149
Hillary Step need
new fixed rope.

635
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,631
And South-East Ridge
as well.

636
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,861
Yes, it does.
Well...

637
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,345
My idea is that
we work together

638
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,421
and we fix
ropes together.

639
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,626
We share the duties.

640
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,861
- Okay?
- Sounds good.

641
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,590
All right,
you and Lopsang maybe get together.

642
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,470
Talk about who wants
to fix what and where, okay?

643
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,711
Only essentials. I'm not
gonna tell you what to pack,

644
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,544
but be brutal. Okay?

645
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,947
One pound down here
is like 10 up there.

646
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,070
Light and fast.

647
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,462
What, and just like that,
you kill my summit cappuccino.

648
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,867
Go. go, go! Run!

649
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,631
- That camera's totally dying.
- Okay.

650
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,748
All right, it's gonna
be a tough week.

651
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,142
But it is gonna be
the best Friday of your lives.

652
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,461
Yeah, what are we
doing again on Friday?

653
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,429
Summiting!

654
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,269
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yes, it is, yes, it is.

655
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,387
I'll take three.

656
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,700
It's from Jan.

657
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,907
I knew it was gonna be a girl.
I can't believe it.

658
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,981
It's a girl!

659
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,109
All right,
good on you!

660
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,545
I knew I was.

661
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,621
I knew she was.
Congratulations.

662
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,509
Thank you, thank you, Doug.
Cheers, mate.

663
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,870
When's she due?

664
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,465
Mid-July, as soon
as I get back.

665
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,985
You better
sleep now, buddy.

666
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,505
Yeah, that's true.

667
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,470
Hey, Rob.

668
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,871
Yeah?
So...

669
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,385
Jan doesn't mind
you being here?

670
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,621
Uh-oh.

671
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,306
Krakauer's sword
is unleashed.

672
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,986
It's okay. Jan's a climber, Jon,
she gets it.

673
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,949
- Yeah!
- Cheers, Helen.

674
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,590
What about you, Doug?
What about your wife?

675
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,788
Oh, she's been fine with it,
ever since we divorced.

676
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,260
She's been great
with everything since then.

677
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,466
I'm so sorry, buddy.

678
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,905
No, no.

679
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,711
No, no, no, I ask
because Peach said to me,

680
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,147
"if you climb one more mountain,
I will divorce you."

681
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,303
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip!

682
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,904
No, no, no,
the worst part of it

683
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,189
is that I kind of
forgot to tell her.

684
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,624
You don't forget to tell her
you're climbing Everest!

685
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,667
I forgot to
tell her, I did.

686
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,789
All right. It's all
on the table, here.

687
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,104
It hurts, it's dangerous,
it destroys relationships,

688
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,830
it's costing you
all a small fortune.

689
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,470
Are there any
negative aspects to this game?

690
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,669
I gotta ask the question,
you know I do.

691
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,185
Why?

692
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,701
Why.

693
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Because...

694
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,064
It's there!

695
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,668
That's why.
Thank you, Mr. Mallory.

696
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,306
- Come on.
- Guys, I'm serious.

697
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,270
Yasuko. Why are you
climbing Everest?

698
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,501
Uh...

699
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,503
I'm 47 years old,

700
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,187
I have reached six of
the seven summits, so...

701
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,901
Of course, now I have
to reach the seventh.

702
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,550
That's not an answer.

703
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,307
No. Why any summit?

704
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,541
Doug.

705
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,906
Me?
Why?

706
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,027
Come on,
tell 'em about the kids.

707
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,101
What?

708
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,511
Tell 'em about the kids.

709
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,991
Whose kids?
Oh...

710
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,789
You have kids?

711
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,380
Yeah, I have kids,
but, I thought I told you,

712
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,940
there's an elementary school,
back home.

713
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,622
And I've been going
and talking to the kids there

714
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,187
and they actually helped me raise
some of the money to come

715
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,548
and gave me a flag
to plant on the summit, and...

716
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,703
So, I was thinking,
maybe it's...

717
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,421
They see a
regular guy can,

718
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,707
you know, follow
impossible dreams,

719
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,623
maybe they'll be inspired

720
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,702
to do the same, I guess.

721
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,940
I'm climbing Mount Everest

722
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,305
because I can.

723
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,228
Because to be able
to climb that high

724
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,463
and see that kind of beauty
that nobody ever sees,

725
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,742
it'd be a crime not to.

726
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,347
Hear, hear, Dougie.

727
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,309
- There you go.
- I like that.

728
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,901
Hello?

729
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,823
<i>Hey. Did I wake you?</i>

730
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,101
No.

731
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,583
<i>I did too, you liar.</i>

732
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,187
<i>Huh?</i>

733
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,823
<i>You okay?</i>
Yeah.

734
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,030
Yeah, yeah,
I'm good, I'm better.

735
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,465
I'm better now, I'm...

736
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,351
<i>I miss you.</i>

737
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,146
<i>We go for
the final ascent tomorrow.</i>

738
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,106
So, you summit Friday?

739
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,750
<i>Yeah, the 10th.</i>

740
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,741
<i>It's your lucky day.</i>

741
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,026
It is.

742
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,510
<i>How's the weather?</i>

743
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,545
It's good.

744
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,622
Yeah, I think we're
gonna get a good window.

745
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,461
<i>So, it's a girl.</i>

746
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,780
Yeah.

747
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,670
And did you go to the doctor,
did you get a scan done?

748
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,787
Did you see her?

749
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,146
<i>Yeah, sure did.</i>

750
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,109
And? Come on.
What did she look like?

751
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,990
Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile,

752
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,107
perfect
height-to-weight ratio,

753
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,024
she's gonna be a great climber.

754
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,870
<i>She's there, Rob.</i>

755
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,747
<i>Already.</i>
Wow.

756
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,784
<i>A little me, a little you.</i>

757
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,385
A little bear, huh?

758
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,791
<i>And then, one day, you</i>

759
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,231
and me

760
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,220
and our little Sarah,

761
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,308
we'll all go climbing
together. Hmm?

762
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,620
Sarah?

763
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,702
<i>Yeah, what do you think?</i>

764
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,828
No way!
<i>Come on.</i>

765
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,901
No!

766
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,311
<i>Please? Think about it.</i>

767
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,711
No.
<i>Huh?</i>

768
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,666
<i>You still there?</i>

769
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,788
Of course I'm still here.

770
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,746
I love you.

771
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,150
<i>Love you, too.</i>

772
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,344
<i>Sleep well, my love.</i>

773
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,388
All right. Bye.

774
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,784
Take it easy, now.
You're gonna be okay.

775
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,101
We're gonna get you
down the hill. All right?

776
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,625
Hey, Neal, you okay?

777
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,509
Yeah, Dale, he doesn't
look too good.

778
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
We need to
take him down.

779
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,945
Yeah.

780
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,943
You can't get
Scott on the radio?

781
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,466
Nope. Nah, I think
he's up ahead.

782
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,623
Best not to stare
too long at the summit.

783
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,941
That's a long way
to go, man.

784
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,623
Head down,
one step at a time.

785
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,384
You got it, boss.

786
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,784
You seen Dale?

787
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,670
Yeah, I did, he wasn't
looking too good

788
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,983
but Neal seemed to have
a handle on the situation.

789
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,061
Tried to get you
on the radio.

790
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,063
You're kidding me.
No.

791
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,262
This thing's
not working, huh?

792
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,631
I'm going down to Camp One.

793
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,629
If he's not doing so well,
I'm gonna take him down to Base Camp

794
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,471
and I'll head back up.
You guys all right?

795
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,780
Yeah.

796
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,188
He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.

797
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,070
Yeah, I'll make it
down in half the time.

798
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,909
I'm gonna
catch you! Whoo!

799
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
Rob to Guy.

800
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,186
<i>Rob to Guy,
you up there, mate?</i>

801
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,740
Yeah, Guy to Rob.
I'm here.

802
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,907
<i>Good to
hear you, Gee.</i>

803
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,304
<i>Where are you?</i>

804
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,269
Camp One, Pumori.

805
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,546
Yeah.

806
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,111
There you go, I got
the old sly rotter.

807
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,706
Listen, I think you're on
the wrong mountain, there.

808
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,702
Look, I can't talk,
we gotta get out of here.

809
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
<i>All right, mate.</i>

810
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,027
<i>Well, listen,
you take care on the kiddie slope.</i>

811
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,704
<i>I'm gonna get back
to the real thing.</i>

812
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,943
<i>Yeah, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.</i>

813
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,941
Ice!

814
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,867
Rob!

815
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,551
I got you!

816
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,311
Harold, you okay?

817
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,744
Is everyone okay?

818
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,424
We're okay!

819
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,583
Come here, sit down, sit.

820
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,866
I'm fine.

821
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,786
Look at me.

822
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,100
Look at me.
I'm fine, mate.

823
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,227
Look at me, Harold!

824
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,825
Look, I'm telling you,
I'm all right.

825
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,709
Okay.
I'm all right.

826
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,301
There you go.
Thank you.

827
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,347
Don't do that
to me again, eh?

828
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,905
I'm sorry.

829
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,101
Okay, mate.

830
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,181
I'm gonna drop
back with Frank,

831
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,308
he's struggling a bit,
all right?

832
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,791
All right.

833
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,821
Straight down.

834
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,549
Let's get him
on the oxygen.

835
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,145
Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,
Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,

836
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,540
Mountain Madness,
how do you copy?

837
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,661
Hey, man! Scott, here.

838
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,831
I've been down to Base Camp,
and I'm back at Camp One.

839
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,470
I'm gonna catch you tomorrow.

840
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,020
What, you're not gonna
rest up a day first? No?

841
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,790
<i>Scott, you sound
a little rough.</i>

842
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,150
<i>Mate, take an extra day.</i>

843
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,144
No way, José, what,
miss out on all the fun?

844
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,182
That's a lot of up and down in one day,
even for you, Scott.

845
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,388
You know what
they say, man.

846
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,064
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

847
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,708
<i>Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?</i>

848
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,906
<i>Scott?</i>
I'll be good.

849
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,745
Just taking a shot
of dexamethasone now.

850
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,421
<i>Well, just don't push yourself
too hard, okay? Over and out.</i>

851
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,821
Rob, I've just been over
to Mal's to get a weather update.

852
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,664
It's moving fast.

853
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,266
It's changed
course slightly.

854
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,264
<i>And it could still go north,
but, if it doesn't</i>

855
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,026
<i>it's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.</i>

856
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,941
It's a weather
forecast, Helen.

857
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,943
This mountain makes
its own weather.

858
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,101
We're keeping an eye on it.

859
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,422
<i>Yeah, sure, just
letting you know.</i>

860
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,110
Appreciate it, Helen.

861
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,783
Why do we do
this to ourselves?

862
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,790
Oh, this is crazy.

863
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,462
You know, I never
told Krakauer this

864
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,781
when he was asking us
why we climb Everest.

865
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,144
When I'm at home

866
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,544
I just got this big,

867
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,381
black cloud following me.

868
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,588
You know,
like a depression?

869
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,510
And when I'm out here

870
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,860
on a mountain,
any mountain...

871
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,180
Yeah?

872
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,862
It's just like it's a cure.

873
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,509
I feel like I'm reborn.

874
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,062
So, you're happy now?

875
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,742
No, I'm starting
to wonder.

876
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,343
This is suffering, man.

877
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,903
Yeah.
This is suffering.

878
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,351
Yeah.

879
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,581
Suffer a few more days,

880
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,185
for the rest of your
life you'll be a guy

881
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,501
that got to the top
of Everest.

882
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,583
Mmm.
Huh?

883
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,022
I just hope I get there.

884
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,065
Yeah.

885
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,066
Just hope I get there,
and get home.

886
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,109
What do you
think, Mike?

887
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,470
Looks pretty good.

888
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,146
Little bit of wind,
up higher.

889
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,382
I mean, if it picks up,
we can always come back down.

890
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,701
Exactly.
It's your call, Rob.

891
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,391
Let's get 'em all going.

892
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,861
Rob!

893
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,101
You okay?

894
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,106
Not good!

895
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,741
Ah.

896
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,789
I'm hoping it's gonna
die down after sundown.

897
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,828
It's been doing that.

898
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,470
I don't like this.

899
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,623
Well, we don't go
if it doesn't calm.

900
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,907
I talk to Scott
when he comes here.

901
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,981
Okay.

902
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,462
Scott! Scott!

903
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,110
Toli?
Here!

904
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,940
Toli!

905
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,631
Where's Rob?
Where are they?

906
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,031
We go down!
No.

907
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,783
What's Rob's...
What's Rob's team doing?

908
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,822
He wants to see
if this passes.

909
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,190
If he waits,

910
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,381
we wait.

911
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,541
Okay.

912
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,990
Hey, guys.

913
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,582
Come out and take a look.

914
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,180
At least somebody
up there loves us.

915
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,546
Nothing?

916
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,342
Where'd the storm go?

917
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,230
Exactly.

918
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,704
That's crazy.

919
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,743
You ready to saddle up?

920
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,189
Okay, everyone.
We got a window.

921
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,582
We don't know
how long it's gonna last,

922
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,867
but we're gonna
go for it.

923
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,829
Be ready in
half an hour.

924
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,140
We'll have
a 2:00 p.m. turnaround,

925
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,460
let's climb this thing.

926
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,666
Okay.

927
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,062
So, today's
the day, huh?

928
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,020
Yep.

929
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,265
Now or never.

930
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,030
Oh, boy.

931
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,900
Now the South Africans
were late out of Camp Three.

932
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,108
They never made
it into Camp Four.

933
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,909
Probably got caught up in it.

934
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,709
<i>Maybe it blew through early.</i>

935
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,226
Yeah, well,
it hit us all night,

936
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,110
but now there's nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

937
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,387
So, it's definitely
worth a shot.

938
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,310
<i>I'll radio out and
tell everyone the news.</i>

939
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,670
<i>Any messages?</i>

940
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,469
Yeah, ring Jan
and tell her that we're heading out.

941
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,269
I'll call you,
Helen, in 12 hours

942
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,910
when we get
to the summit.

943
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,789
Turnaround's 2:00 p.m.

944
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,783
<i>Good luck,
and Godspeed to you all.</i>

945
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,669
Okay, thanks,
Helen. Bye-bye.

946
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,866
I'll see you
guys up there.

947
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,021
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

948
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,387
Gonna get a couple hours of sleep,
and I'll be right behind you.

949
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,461
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

950
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,587
Have fun, Pittman.

951
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,503
You get some
rest, okay?

952
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,580
See you there.

953
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,384
You got the ropes
for the Hillary Step?

954
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,586
Yeah.

955
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,991
Okay.
Okay.

956
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,903
Okay. Yeah.

957
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,023
Can we go
any faster?

958
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,309
Not a chance we can go faster here.
It's too difficult.

959
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,382
This could take a while.

960
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,064
We're losing time.

961
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,502
Beck. What's wrong?

962
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,070
I don't know.

963
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,222
I had an operation a couple years ago,
on my eyes.

964
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,586
That might be it.

965
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,501
- I don't know.
- Okay.

966
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,423
You guys go
in front of us.

967
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,549
All right, Beck,
let's sit you down.

968
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,382
Beck. Look at me.

969
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,941
I need to send you
down with someone.

970
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,220
No, I don't wanna
go down, Rob.

971
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,588
No, you gotta go down.
I don't wanna go down.

972
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,946
Okay.

973
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,790
Right, Beck, listen.

974
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,147
You can wait here for half an hour.
Beck, listen to me.

975
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,591
If it gets
better by then

976
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,660
join in the queue
and keep going up.

977
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,667
But if it doesn't get better, Beck,
I'm sorry, mate, it's over.

978
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,741
Okay.

979
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,026
The Sherpas are
gonna go up and drop off

980
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,590
the extra oxygen
at the South Summit

981
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,189
then I'm gonna send
one of them down for you.

982
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,109
Is that clear?
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

983
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,345
Okay, mate.

984
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,785
All right.

985
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,025
See you.

986
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,381
Sandy, do
you want to go down?

987
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,701
What? No. No way.

988
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,862
Look, Lopsang,
I'm gonna make it to the top.

989
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,941
Do you understand?

990
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,470
Okay.
I'm not going back.

991
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,429
Okay?
Okay,

992
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,791
Where are the ropes?

993
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,340
There is no rope!
No rope.

994
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,751
Yeah, they
should have been fixed.

995
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,749
Do you have more
in your pack?

996
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,511
Lopsang
has the rope. He's not here!

997
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,628
Harold. No ropes?

998
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,787
No.

999
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,027
Neal.

1000
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,147
Hey, Rob.

1001
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,750
Listen, we got
a problem, here, mate.

1002
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,461
There's no fixed ropes on the
traverse to the Hillary Step, over.

1003
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,780
<i>Where's Ang
Dorjee and Lopsang?</i>

1004
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,271
Yeah, I've got
Ang Dorjee here,

1005
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,905
but there's no
sign of Lopsang.

1006
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,665
So me, Neal,
and Toli are gonna

1007
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,469
have to set some
new ones, over.

1008
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,740
- Find them?
- Yeah.

1009
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,669
Good.
Let's do it!

1010
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,104
What's going on?

1011
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,830
No fixed ropes.

1012
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,987
What?

1013
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,905
That's it.

1014
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,221
One step at
a time, Doug.

1015
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,786
Come on, Dougie.
Deep breaths, Dougie.

1016
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,584
Come on, mate,
keep it on, keep it on.

1017
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,345
Deep breaths, Dougie, hang on.
Hang on.

1018
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,023
You can
do this, Dougie.

1019
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,226
I know you can, pal.

1020
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,301
Yeah.

1021
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,020
I don't wanna see you back here
a third time, mate.

1022
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,901
Huh?

1023
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,630
John. You headed
back down?

1024
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,345
There's a holdup.

1025
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,582
There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.

1026
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,946
Yeah, I know, mate,

1027
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,943
but we're sorting
that situation out now.

1028
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,183
Ran out of juice,
waiting. Cold.

1029
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,785
I'm sorry, Rob.

1030
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,624
It's your call, pal.

1031
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,789
I don't wanna run
out of oxygen up there.

1032
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,271
Sorry, Rob.

1033
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,670
<i>Yeah, bit of a setback.</i>

1034
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,823
<i>Lou, Stuart, and John Taske
just turned back.</i>

1035
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,028
<i>Just below the South Summit.</i>

1036
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,704
How are the conditions,
so far?

1037
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,191
<i>Cold and windy.</i>

1038
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,625
Okay, let me know, Rob.

1039
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,941
<i>Okay, Helen,
thanks, bye-bye.</i>

1040
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,070
I hope we're not looking at
another year

1041
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,950
with no clients
at the top.

1042
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,102
Well, if they
don't get a move on pretty soon

1043
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,182
they're out of time,
aren't they?

1044
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,341
Yeah.

1045
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,221
And what's Jon gonna say
about that in his article?

1046
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,941
<i>It's Rob. Guys...</i>

1047
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,227
<i>We just lost Lou,
Stu, and John Taske.</i>

1048
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,502
<i>What's going on,
what's the holdup?</i>

1049
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,025
Yeah, mate, we're...

1050
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,424
We still have Toli and Neal
at the top of the Step

1051
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,911
fixing the ropes.

1052
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,704
We're at the base
of the Step, over.

1053
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,350
<i>Rob, it's Mike.</i>

1054
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,427
How's Doug faring?

1055
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,107
Doug's just behind me,
I left him behind to scoot forward.

1056
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,227
Yeah, I got eyes
on you right now,

1057
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,270
yep, that's me.
Let's move as...

1058
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,104
As quickly as
possible, over.

1059
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,341
<i>We'll start
moving everybody up,</i>

1060
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,185
<i>as soon as we get
the all clear.</i>

1061
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,306
<i>Rob to base, Rob to base,
how copy, Helen?</i>

1062
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,781
- You all right?
<i>- Copy, Base Camp to Rob.</i>

1063
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,624
Have you heard from Scott?

1064
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,624
Anyone managed to find out
where he is, over?

1065
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,941
<i>Whoo-ie!
Yo, dude!</i>

1066
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,863
Look, where
are you, mate?

1067
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,510
We got a real logjam,
here at the Hillary Step, over.

1068
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,070
<i>We're more than
an hour behind!</i>

1069
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,181
Just Chill.

1070
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,740
<i>People are just sitting here,
using up their oxygen.</i>

1071
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,948
<i>Get here as soon as you can.</i>

1072
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,190
You feeling okay, Beck?

1073
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,343
Yeah, I got a little
problem with my eyes.

1074
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,546
You guys turned back?

1075
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,348
There's a logjam below the Hillary Step.
It's crazy.

1076
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,545
Come down with us.

1077
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,464
Nah, I can't, promised
Rob I'd wait for him.

1078
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,030
Your call.
I'm good.

1079
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,102
See you down there.

1080
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,864
Neal, ready!

1081
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,268
Okay, Toli!
I'm done.

1082
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,427
Off rope! Safe to climb!

1083
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,990
Okay,
we're climbing up!

1084
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,221
Hey, Mike.
What?

1085
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,069
You mind if I go first?
Why?

1086
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,306
I'm running
pretty low on O.

1087
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,542
Rob, it's Mike, here.

1088
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,544
We've had the all-clear
on this end.

1089
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,110
<i>I'm gonna stay
here with Yasuko,</i>

1090
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,387
<i>until we get a clear line.</i>

1091
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,942
<i>I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug, over and out.</i>

1092
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,105
Come here.

1093
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,746
We did it!

1094
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,190
You did it!

1095
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,460
Yasuko.

1096
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,620
Seven.
Seven.

1097
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,065
Seven Summits.
Seven.

1098
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,141
Come here. I'm so
proud of you, Yasuko.

1099
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,063
So proud.

1100
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,505
Thank you.

1101
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,382
<i>Rob to Base, Rob to Base.</i>

1102
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,866
Rob, this is Helen, hello?
Where are you?

1103
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,420
<i>I'm on the top of Everest,
Helen, we made it.</i>

1104
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,140
<i>How copy us, over?</i>

1105
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,183
We copy you loud
and clear, Rob.

1106
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,150
It's wonderful to
hear your voice up there.

1107
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,551
<i>Who are you with, again, say?</i>

1108
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,509
At the moment,
I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

1109
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,224
- Headed down, Rob.
- Now you have to go.

1110
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,268
Rob.
See you. Thank you.

1111
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,820
Jon K has already
been and gone.

1112
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,669
<i>Doug is just
coming over the horizon.</i>

1113
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,788
And what about Beck?

1114
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,511
<i>Beck was having a problem
with his eyesight.</i>

1115
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,790
He waited on the southeast ridge,
on the Balcony

1116
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,181
for the first people
that came back, over.

1117
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,184
And I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

1118
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,830
<i>We'll be off
in a few minutes.</i>

1119
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,867
<i>Just as soon
as I see Doug,</i>

1120
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,590
<i>we'll be heading
back down, over.</i>

1121
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,661
Right, understood.

1122
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,424
Well, that's
terrific, Rob.

1123
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,026
<i>We're all keeping
our fingers crossed for Doug.</i>

1124
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,909
<i>Over and out, Helen.</i>

1125
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,108
Congratulations.
Welcome!

1126
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,227
Yeah, Lopsy!

1127
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,461
You did it!

1128
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,341
Whoo-ie!

1129
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,424
You look terrible.

1130
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,543
My stomach's not
so good, man.

1131
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,221
See Doug?

1132
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,143
Oh, yeah. He's way, way,

1133
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,148
way back there, man.

1134
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,906
Hey, Roberto.
Where are the rest of your guys?

1135
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,109
'Cause I'm pretty
sure my whole team

1136
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,625
made it up, yeah?

1137
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,065
I saw 'em.

1138
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,787
Don't worry,
I won't tell Krakauer.

1139
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,147
Well done, mate.
I had a mixed bag.

1140
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,302
I'll have to
give you this year.

1141
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,661
Scott, you really
don't look too good.

1142
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,344
- Lopsang.
- Yeah?

1143
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,821
Come on, mate,
let's get him down.

1144
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,711
All right.
Let's go.

1145
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,986
Harold. What are you doing?

1146
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:00,463
I'm just trying to sort the O.
I can't find any full ones.

1147
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,588
There's full bottles,
I saw 'em on the way up.

1148
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,661
No.

1149
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,583
No, I'm pretty sure,
you should have another look.

1150
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,981
No, I just have,
they're not full.

1151
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,061
Harold, listen, I saw...

1152
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,222
Look, mate,
I checked twice, all right?

1153
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,945
Yeah. All right, man.

1154
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,945
I'm going down.

1155
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,225
Harold?

1156
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,870
Doug, Doug, Doug.

1157
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,030
It's over, mate.
What?

1158
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,864
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.

1159
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,863
Doug, you're
too late, okay?

1160
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,620
You guys keep going,
mate, I'll catch up.

1161
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,623
Doug, Doug.
Doug, listen to me.

1162
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,580
- It's way too late. It's over.
- No, come on!

1163
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,066
Listen to me, mate,
I'm sorry,

1164
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,586
but I gotta
turn you around.

1165
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,707
Okay?

1166
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,305
I can do it.

1167
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,510
It's right here, man.
It's right here.

1168
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,181
I'm not coming back next year, man,
it's my last chance.

1169
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,542
You gotta
let me do this.

1170
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,870
Let me do this.

1171
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,230
Okay.
Please, Rob.

1172
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,506
Let's do it.

1173
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,309
Let's get it done.
All right.

1174
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,269
Come on.
Thanks, man.

1175
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,185
Come on, Doug.

1176
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:49,022
<i>There
ain't no hope of getting</i>

1177
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,900
<i>My double-wide trailer</i>

1178
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,420
<i>There ain't no...</i>

1179
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,626
Beck?

1180
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,711
Are you okay?

1181
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,986
Who is that?

1182
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,061
It's Jon.

1183
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:07,108
I'm not seeing too well, Jon.
I'm freezing.

1184
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,629
Mike's just behind me.

1185
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,987
He's back there
with Yasuko.

1186
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,825
You'll be okay.
Mike's right behind me.

1187
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,829
You're okay?

1188
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,231
I'll see you down there.

1189
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,109
There she is.

1190
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,181
Ten more steps, mate.

1191
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,061
Dig deep, Doug, dig deep.

1192
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,585
There you go.

1193
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,824
There ya go.

1194
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,347
You made it!

1195
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,341
Huh?

1196
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,705
You did it!

1197
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,106
Because of you, man.

1198
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,467
Guy to Rob,
you read me, mate?

1199
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,228
Guy to Rob,
are you there?

1200
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,789
For the
school kids.

1201
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,180
Good on you, Doug.
Come on.

1202
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,147
Easy.

1203
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,745
Here, I got it.

1204
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,268
Come on, let's
get you up.

1205
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,387
Need more O.

1206
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,461
No, Doug, we can't
give you more O.

1207
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:54,101
We gotta get down to
the South Summit, come on.

1208
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,742
Guy Cotter to Everest Base Camp.
You there, Helen?

1209
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,061
Guy, this is Helen,
how's it going?

1210
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,140
<i>Yeah, fine.</i>

1211
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,830
I got a clear
view of the summit

1212
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,629
and we've still got
climbers up there.

1213
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,668
They're not any
of ours, right?

1214
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:13,186
We got three up,
and they're all on their way down.

1215
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,830
<i>Well, what are they
doing there so late?</i>

1216
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,380
<i>They had a 2:00 turnaround time,
they're way past it.</i>

1217
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,785
Yeah, we got cloud coming up
through the valley,

1218
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,265
it's a lot of it.

1219
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,820
<i>Thanks, I'm calling
them now, Guy.</i>

1220
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,467
Rob, come in,
this is Helen.

1221
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,707
Rob, come in,
this is Helen.

1222
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,021
Whoa!

1223
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,341
Easy, easy, easy, Dougie!
There you go.

1224
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,865
There you go.

1225
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:49,227
Looking good.
Round the corner.

1226
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,866
That's it.

1227
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,390
Rob,
is that you?

1228
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,621
Beck?

1229
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,701
It's Mike, Beck.
What are you doing here?

1230
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,544
I can't
see, it's bad.

1231
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,145
You guys all right?

1232
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,665
We got a problem
with Beck.

1233
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,068
Hey, Mike, we're getting low on O.
We gotta move.

1234
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,710
Gonna get you to
stand up, okay?

1235
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,827
I'll take Yasuko.

1236
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,981
That's it.

1237
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,186
I got you.

1238
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,911
You're okay.

1239
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,427
Doug, come on!

1240
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,786
Come on!

1241
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,300
I'm cold.

1242
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,471
Mike, Harold, Ang Dorjee,
put the brakes on, guys,

1243
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,144
we got a problem.

1244
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,544
We're out of gas, Doug.

1245
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,509
We're out of gas.
Need to keep moving, come on.

1246
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,581
Come on!

1247
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,830
<i>Mike, Harold, do you copy?
I need someone.</i>

1248
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,709
<i>I need someone to come back up
with oxygen, over.</i>

1249
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,620
<i>Somebody, please,
I'm begging you.</i>

1250
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,583
Doug, come on, mate,
come on!

1251
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,468
Harold, do you copy, over?

1252
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,667
<i>Has anyone got
eyes on Ang Dorjee?</i>

1253
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,510
Mate, I've
just had Ang Dorjee

1254
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,423
go past me,
heading down, over.

1255
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,070
He's going down.

1256
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,824
<i>Can you stop him,
can you turn him around?</i>

1257
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,590
<i>I need someone to
come back up now.</i>

1258
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,708
Hey, Ang Dorjee!

1259
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,261
Ang Dorjee!

1260
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,588
<i>Base Camp,
do you copy, over?</i>

1261
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,748
<i>Helen
to Rob, go ahead.</i>

1262
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,948
<i>Helen, please.
I need a bottle of gas</i>

1263
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,829
<i>at the top of
the Hillary Step.</i>

1264
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,502
I can't get him
down without it.

1265
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,309
I'm really stuffed.

1266
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,349
Understood that you
need a bottle of oxygen

1267
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,990
at the bottom of
the Hillary Step.

1268
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,745
<i>We are sending it up to you,
as soon as we can.</i>

1269
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,266
At the top, at the top.

1270
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,909
<i>The last thing I said
to Ang Dorjee was</i>

1271
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,790
<i>"Please, leave two bottles of gas
at the South Summit."</i>

1272
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,861
Yes.

1273
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,030
<i>Copy that, Rob.</i>

1274
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,101
<i>Boys,</i>

1275
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:09,502
there's oxygen at
the South Summit, right?

1276
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,981
<i>No,
Rob, this is Harold.</i>

1277
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,588
There's no oxygen
at South Summit.

1278
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,350
Repeat, no O.

1279
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,148
Ang Dorjee stashed
four bottles there, Harold.

1280
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,381
Harold, where are you?

1281
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,144
<i>Can you hear me, Harold?</i>

1282
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,221
<i>Harold!</i>

1283
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,069
<i>Harold, can you hear me?</i>

1284
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,301
Think it'll take me about

1285
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,462
<i>half an hour to get
back up to the South Summit.</i>

1286
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,306
Okay, I'm coming.

1287
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,746
<i>If you don't
have oxygen, mate,</i>

1288
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,151
<i>don't come up,
don't come up.</i>

1289
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,220
<i>We're moving on.</i>

1290
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,308
I'm coming
up to you, Rob.

1291
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,268
Doug, come on,
mate, come on!

1292
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,587
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1293
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,548
<i>I copy you, Caro.</i>

1294
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,907
Rob, can you get
yourself down?

1295
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,264
Caro, we're not
at that point, yet.

1296
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,188
Rob, can you let us
know who you're with?

1297
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,270
<i>I'm with Doug.</i>

1298
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,990
We're both listening.

1299
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,711
Come on, Dougie, come on, mate.
One more effort, come on.

1300
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,226
Rob, what is
Doug's state of consciousness?

1301
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,540
<i>He's really weak.</i>

1302
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:28,430
He collapsed after
we ran out of oxygen.

1303
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,946
Okay, give him eight milligrams
of dexamethasone.

1304
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,347
That's two tablets, Rob.

1305
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,421
<i>Guy to Rob.</i>

1306
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,589
<i>Go ahead, Guy,
I got you, mate.</i>

1307
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,067
Rob, I suggest you
get yourself down.

1308
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,710
You know you're
doing no good up there.

1309
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,748
Now, we've got people
that we can send up to help Doug

1310
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:49,391
but you've gotta get yourself down,
do you understand?

1311
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,820
I mean, come on, man,
we're playing with a man's life here.

1312
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:55,391
There's no way I'm
leaving Doug behind.

1313
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,027
We gotta keep
moving, mate.

1314
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,307
No, we gotta keep moving,
we're in some trouble.

1315
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,862
Yeah, Helen's gonna
need some help

1316
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,864
so I'm gonna try and make my way back.
Okay?

1317
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,783
All right. Go on.

1318
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,984
Hey, Scott.

1319
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,028
Scott! You okay?

1320
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,901
Lopsang.

1321
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,661
Lopsy!

1322
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,505
I'm done, pal.

1323
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,626
I'm done.

1324
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,824
You go, send Anatoli...

1325
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,421
Send Anatoli back
with some O.

1326
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,747
Okay.

1327
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,629
Go!
Okay.

1328
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,544
I will send back Anatoli.

1329
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:01,942
Let's go.
You go down.

1330
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:03,067
No, mate.

1331
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,265
No, I'm not
leaving you behind, Doug.

1332
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,990
Come on!
Gotta rest.

1333
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,028
No, Doug, come on,
you're coming with me!

1334
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,102
I need 10 good minutes,
Doug, come on!

1335
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,462
Please, Dougie,
come on, mate.

1336
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,827
Ten minutes. We'll get
to the bottom of the Step.

1337
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,346
Come on, this leg.

1338
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,502
This leg, Dougie, come on!

1339
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,426
Come on.

1340
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,551
There we go.

1341
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,381
Oh, no.

1342
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:50,987
Oh, no.

1343
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,743
Hold that down.
Come on, come on!
Get those chairs!

1344
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,021
No, no, no, no.
Come on, Dougie!

1345
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,148
Doug, let's go, hurry up!

1346
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,661
Doug! I'm gonna go
to the South Summit to get oxygen.

1347
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:25,301
Okay, mate?
Gonna find oxygen.

1348
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,508
But you've gotta
stay here!

1349
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,582
Okay? Stay here!

1350
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,662
Don't move!
I'll be back!

1351
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,866
Hey, Rob.

1352
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:41,303
Beck! Stop!
That's the wrong way!

1353
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,427
Stop!

1354
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,707
Back! Turn back!

1355
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,470
Beck, easy!

1356
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,666
Rob!

1357
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,746
Harold!

1358
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,467
Harold!

1359
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,986
Rob!

1360
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,708
- Harold?
- I've got oxygen!

1361
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,026
Here, I found some
half-empty ones.

1362
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,230
Where's Doug?

1363
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,305
Doug's gone.

1364
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,071
He's what?

1365
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,507
Gone!

1366
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,384
Camp Four's that way!

1367
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,507
Get up!

1368
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,511
Let's go!

1369
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:22,505
Come on! Beck!

1370
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,068
I'll get help!

1371
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,260
Here!

1372
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,620
- Toli!
- Where are the others?

1373
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,701
They're still out there.

1374
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,141
Jon! I need help!

1375
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,221
What?

1376
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,503
They're out there,
I need help!

1377
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:38,106
I can't see, Toli.

1378
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,745
I'm snow-blind.

1379
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:42,105
Beck, Doug.

1380
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,785
They need help.

1381
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,862
They're still outside...

1382
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:51,425
I go find them!
You stay here!

1383
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,421
Good job.

1384
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,704
Toli!
Sandy needs O!

1385
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,509
Sandy, here!

1386
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,821
Can you walk?
I can't.

1387
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,304
I'll come back!

1388
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,981
I'll stay!

1389
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:52,230
Here, give me
that, come on.

1390
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,064
It won't go,
it's frozen!

1391
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,505
Take this.

1392
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,940
The glove.

1393
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,831
I'm sorry.

1394
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,905
Come on, mate.

1395
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:16,980
Come on, Harold.

1396
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,389
Thanks for
coming back.

1397
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,621
<i>Hello, Base Camp.</i>

1398
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:44,986
Helen, it's Jan.

1399
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,223
<i>Why haven't I heard from you?
Why isn't anybody calling me?</i>

1400
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,782
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

1401
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,866
Where is he?

1402
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,903
<i>We don't know, exactly, but</i>

1403
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,622
he was still on
the summit at 4:00.

1404
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,862
<i>Oh, no. Can he get down?</i>

1405
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,742
<i>Rob can, but Doug can't.</i>

1406
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,945
There's at least 13
people stranded up there

1407
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,864
and, well,
the storm is getting worse.

1408
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,104
<i>Get Ang Dorjee up there.</i>

1409
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:19,227
<i>He'll bring them down.</i>

1410
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,349
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen! Give me an update!

1411
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,900
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

1412
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:27,424
Jan, yeah,
we will get him.

1413
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,231
And I will call you,
the minute I hear from him.

1414
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,825
As soon as I
hear from him.

1415
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,026
<i>Thanks, Helen.</i>
All right?

1416
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,101
<i>Okay.</i>

1417
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,380
Where is he?
Guy, I haven't heard from him.

1418
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,467
Okay, I'll get him.

1419
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,144
I've been trying.

1420
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,262
- Guy...
- Just hang on, hang on.

1421
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,502
Rob? It's Guy,
where are you?

1422
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,503
Guy, I've been doing that
for the last two hours.

1423
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,582
All right.
Rob, it's Guy.

1424
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,069
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

1425
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,744
Once you catch a break,
you move, you know the drill.

1426
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,744
We've got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

1427
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:57,821
Whoever needs it can have it.

1428
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,947
That's the way, thank you.

1429
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,704
Mal's team are gonna
go up, they're gonna

1430
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,703
mount a search as
soon as they can.

1431
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:05,670
Anyone who's going,
we're gonna leave at dawn,
weather permitting.

1432
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,740
Of course, Helen.
At dawn.

1433
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,906
That's great, David.

1434
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,869
Go let Ed know what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

1435
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:12,181
Camp Four, come in.

1436
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,308
Rob. Rob, can
you hear me?

1437
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,587
David Breashears
has a stash of oxygen

1438
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,901
at the South Col
that we can use.

1439
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,625
All right, mate,
we're organizing a team,

1440
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,464
we're coming to get you.

1441
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,346
Hot.

1442
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,705
Burning up.

1443
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:09,460
No, no.

1444
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,181
Yasuko.

1445
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,906
Sandy?

1446
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,511
Come on!

1447
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,307
Rob, talk to me,
please. Pick up.

1448
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,229
Pick up, mate, please.

1449
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,710
Is there any word
on the others?

1450
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,669
Anatoli managed to
get three clients back

1451
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,220
from the South Col
last night,

1452
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,191
but Beck and Yasuko
are still out there.

1453
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:09,421
They're trying
to mount a search

1454
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,300
but everyone
who's been up there is exhausted.

1455
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,750
Rob, is that you?

1456
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:20,823
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

1457
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,703
<i>Rob, this is Base Camp.</i>

1458
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,022
I can't... I can't move...

1459
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,831
I can't move anymore.
Anymore.

1460
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:35,389
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

1461
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,588
But you gotta
keep on moving.

1462
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,424
<i>My hands...</i>

1463
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,185
<i>I can't feel my hands,
they're frozen.</i>

1464
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:47,342
<i>Gotta de-ice my mask.</i>

1465
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,500
<i>I gotta de-ice my mask.</i>

1466
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:53,060
That's good. Yeah,
you gotta get that mask working. Yeah?

1467
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,585
The sun's gonna
come up and,

1468
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,027
you know,
you can get warmer,
you can get moving.

1469
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,943
<i>Guy.</i>
Yeah?

1470
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:01,910
<i>Guy. Harold was here.</i>

1471
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,106
<i>Where's he gone?</i>

1472
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,421
Rob, is Doug with you?

1473
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,950
Harold...

1474
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,910
Doug... Doug's gone.

1475
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,551
<i>Harold's gone.</i>

1476
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,542
<i>I'm gonna need a little help.</i>

1477
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,949
Okay, Rob,
you gotta get yourself down.

1478
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,869
Where are you?

1479
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,021
<i>Guy...</i>

1480
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,468
<i>I'm in that little...</i>

1481
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,703
In that little dip just
below the South Summit.

1482
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,831
<i>All right.
You can do this.</i>

1483
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,106
You just gotta, you know,

1484
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,381
pull yourself up
out of that dip

1485
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,383
and slide the
rest of the way.

1486
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,781
Guy, send the boys.

1487
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,305
Okay?

1488
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,821
I'm gonna need
a little help.

1489
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,106
<i>We've got some
Sherpas coming up there</i>

1490
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:54,591
<i>with tea, oxygen.</i>

1491
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,742
You just gotta
come on down, mate.

1492
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,584
Yeah? Come on down.

1493
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:01,627
Rob.

1494
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,823
Can you patch
Jan through?

1495
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,186
To Rob?

1496
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,625
Patch her through, yeah?

1497
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,384
Let's just try it.
Let's just...

1498
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,986
Put the sat phone
next to the radio.

1499
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,582
Yeah, if anyone can motivate him to move,
then Jan will.

1500
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:23,104
<i>Guy to Rob.</i>

1501
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:24,591
<i>Guy to Rob.</i>

1502
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,708
<i>Guy to Rob.
Can you read me?</i>

1503
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,391
We're just getting...
Rob, are you there?

1504
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,622
We're getting him now.
Here.

1505
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:42,104
Rob, this is Helen.

1506
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,381
<i>Copy.</i>

1507
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,142
Rob, I've got
Jan for you.

1508
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,225
<i>My Jan?</i>

1509
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,301
Yeah, she's just here.

1510
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,711
Jan, you're on.

1511
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,941
<i>Okay.</i>

1512
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:59,341
<i>Hi, sweetheart,
how are you doing?</i>

1513
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,345
Hi, my love.

1514
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,421
I'm a bit...

1515
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,271
<i>A bit cold</i>

1516
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:10,229
<i>but I'm okay.</i>

1517
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,029
I know you are.

1518
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,307
<i>But the sun'll
warm you soon.</i>

1519
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:16,227
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

1520
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,903
<i>You've gotta get moving.</i>

1521
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,986
<i>You've gotta come on down.</i>

1522
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,185
<i>My hands</i>

1523
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,505
<i>are frozen.</i>

1524
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,629
My feet are frozen.

1525
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:38,302
<i>We're sending people
up to you with tea and O's.</i>

1526
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:41,589
But you've gotta get moving.
Rob? Can you hear me?

1527
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,501
<i>You've gotta get
your circulation going.</i>

1528
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:46,150
Okay, my love.

1529
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,864
You do it...
You do it right now.

1530
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,831
I love you.

1531
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,426
Over and out.

1532
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,544
Come on, Rob.

1533
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,469
We can't carry them.

1534
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:03,909
It's not possible.

1535
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:04,981
It's gonna...

1536
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,188
It's gonna take all we got

1537
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,342
just to get
ourselves down.

1538
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,423
I don't wanna die, man.

1539
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,506
<i>Helen, it's Mike here.
Do you copy?</i>

1540
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,390
Come in, Mike.
What do you got?

1541
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:28,350
Yasuko and Beck

1542
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,627
did not make it
back to camp.

1543
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,748
Okay, Mike. Thanks
for letting us know.

1544
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,106
Meg?

1545
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,146
Bub?

1546
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,744
Helen Base Camp.
Helen Base Camp.

1547
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:55,224
<i>Helen Base Camp.</i>

1548
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,149
Ang Dorjee,
this is Helen.

1549
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,824
<i>We have to turn back!</i>

1550
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,542
<i>There is a very
bad storm again.</i>

1551
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,382
Your call, Ang Dorjee.
<i>Sorry.</i>

1552
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,430
We'll try to again
when the storm's passed.

1553
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,788
<i>We'll leave some tea
and oxygen here. Sorry.</i>

1554
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:22,108
We have to tell Rob
they're not coming.

1555
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:25,225
Okay.

1556
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:35,506
<i>Hey, Rob,
it's Guy, mate.</i>

1557
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,866
Guy.

1558
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:41,630
Can't stop shaking, mate.

1559
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:45,784
<i>The boys have hit
a bit of high wind.</i>

1560
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,824
<i>And your best shot is
gonna be to get lower.</i>

1561
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,389
Let me think about it.

1562
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:58,864
<i>I think I can hang
out here another night.</i>

1563
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,740
We'll try again
first thing, okay?

1564
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,026
Helen?
<i>Yeah.</i>

1565
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,748
<i>Yeah, he's still there.</i>

1566
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:24,186
He's just below
the South Summit.

1567
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:29,468
He's got oxygen,
but it's iced up.

1568
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,623
<i>We don't know whether
he's been able to free it.</i>

1569
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:36,788
Is anybody with him?

1570
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:38,305
<i>No.</i>

1571
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:40,146
<i>No.</i>

1572
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,181
<i>You have to get
him down before dark.</i>

1573
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:44,388
<i>He won't survive
another night.</i>

1574
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,700
We know.

1575
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:50,144
But the storm's
come back, real bad.

1576
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:54,550
<i>We can't get anyone
up to him tonight.</i>

1577
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,906
<i>We tried.</i>

1578
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,061
He might as well
be on the moon.

1579
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,741
Uh...

1580
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,506
<i>Can you put me
on with him again?</i>

1581
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:11,911
Of course.

1582
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,268
Guy, get Rob.

1583
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,270
Hey, Rob,
it's Guy.

1584
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,708
<i>I've got Jan for you.</i>

1585
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:31,106
Hold on.
Give me a sec.

1586
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,906
<i>Okay.</i>

1587
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,470
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

1588
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:00,464
<i>How are you?</i>

1589
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,541
I'm thinking about you.

1590
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:11,110
You sound good.

1591
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,623
<i>Are you warm, my love?</i>

1592
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,067
I might have
a little frostbite.

1593
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:24,344
I'm looking forward to
making it all better.

1594
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,462
<i>I can't wait for you
to come home.</i>

1595
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:34,185
<i>How's Sarah?</i>

1596
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,505
Sarah?

1597
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,785
<i>Yeah.</i>

1598
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,349
Yeah, Sarah's good.

1599
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:46,786
<i>Will you call her that
for me?</i>

1600
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,909
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

1601
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:54,664
I don't think
I'm gonna get to meet her.

1602
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,103
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1603
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,510
Don't say that.

1604
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,181
If anyone can
make it, you can.

1605
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,785
<i>Remember?</i>

1606
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,545
I love you.

1607
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,866
Please don't worry too much.

1608
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,268
<i>Good night, my love.</i>

1609
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:46,903
I love you, Rob.

1610
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,585
<i>I love you.</i>

1611
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,105
Beck?

1612
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:23,183
<i>Helen,
it's Mike here.</i>

1613
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,544
<i>Helen, do you copy?</i>

1614
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,704
Mike, come in.

1615
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,544
<i>Beck's still alive.</i>

1616
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:31,782
<i>He walked himself into camp.</i>

1617
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:34,022
<i>David Breashears
and the IMAX team</i>

1618
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,262
<i>are gonna get him
down to Camp One.</i>

1619
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:40,190
Thanks, Mike.

1620
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:47,502
<i>We don't even
know how, but he is alive.</i>

1621
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,626
<i>The thing is, Peach,</i>

1622
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:52,104
we can't get him
down the Icefall.

1623
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:53,466
<i>Oh, no, I'll
get him down.</i>

1624
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,747
I'll get him down. Okay.

1625
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:58,744
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

1626
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:01,585
Yeah, but they can't take
a helicopter up that high

1627
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,344
because the air is too thin.

1628
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:06,744
<i>We should try,
but it is one heck of a risk.</i>

1629
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:08,584
And he's not in
a good way, Peach,

1630
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,867
so I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

1631
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,229
One step at a time.

1632
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,746
You gotta keep moving.
Tired.

1633
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:23,901
I know.
I'm tired.

1634
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,022
I know you are. Come on.

1635
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:29,990
Slow and steady.

1636
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:34,027
Come on,
keep moving.

1637
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,590
Yes, I'd like
the number

1638
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:38,345
of the American Embassy
in Kathmandu, Nepal.

1639
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:41,267
Yes, Nepal.
Ambassador, please.

1640
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:42,785
No, sweets,
I can't hold.

1641
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:45,306
No, you listen, sir,
my husband's already died once

1642
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,791
as you'll have
seen on the news.

1643
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,340
Trust me, having him
die a second time

1644
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:50,747
is not gonna
play well on CNN.

1645
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:53,109
There we go, buddy.

1646
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:56,103
That's it, all right.

1647
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:02,341
Mike.

1648
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:03,421
Mmm-hmm.

1649
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,581
How you doing?

1650
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,742
Oh, you know,
fair to middling.

1651
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,071
Warming up?

1652
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,710
I'm not sure yet.

1653
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:15,900
Look like you are,
a little bit.

1654
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,743
How's Rob doing?

1655
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,987
Rob's still up
there right now.

1656
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,588
And Doug?
What's he up to?

1657
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:36,589
Doug's gone, Beck.

1658
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:53,701
I don't know,
no one's ever tried

1659
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,225
to fly higher than
Base Camp before,

1660
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,109
they're gonna give it a go.

1661
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,751
You find an LZ,
just mark it out with whatever you can.

1662
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:02,300
Okay, worth a try.
Thanks, Guy.

1663
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:03,825
Yeah?
Grab a Gatorade.

1664
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:06,187
Got a chopper coming in,
we need to make an LZ.

1665
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,422
We got a chopper
coming in!

1666
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,623
Clear everyone
back to the tents!

1667
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,420
Thanks.

1668
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,269
Keep it clear,
keep this whole area clear.

1669
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:16,381
Back away.

1670
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,428
Come on,
come on.

1671
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:24,700
<i>Army 45, keep updating.</i>

1672
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:27,507
<i>Lukla Tower,
we're doing fine.</i>

1673
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:35,182
It's not possible!

1674
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:37,508
You land here,
we'll never get back up.

1675
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:44,265
Gonna kill us!

1676
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:46,149
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1677
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:05,940
That's it!

1678
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,586
We can't get any more out.
It's as light as we're gonna get it!

1679
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:10,389
Time to
go then, Major.

1680
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,348
Right here,
right here!

1681
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,589
Come on!
You can do it!

1682
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:02,226
Come on, buddy.
You're nearly there.

1683
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,150
Okay, come on.

1684
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:11,790
One person.
Only one person.

1685
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:14,704
Yeah, it's just him, just one!
There.

1686
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,225
There you go.

1687
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:20,871
You're good!

1688
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:24,669
I'm going to lift the tail up,
to fly us over the edge.

1689
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,947
Fall a bit, until
the blades catch on the air.

1690
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:28,226
Is that okay with you?

1691
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,302
- I'm with you.
- Good man.

1692
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:52,790
Get yourself inside,
go on.

1693
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,180
Oh, Anatoli.

1694
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:06,384
I'm so sorry, Helen.

1695
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,667
Come on, let's
get you inside.

1696
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:31,871
Hi, Peachy.

1697
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:38,066
Hey.

1698
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:53,546
Thank you
so much, darling.
