<i>[ It's The Most Wonderful Time
"Of The Year:" Andy Williams]</i>

2
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,152
[screams]

3
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,452
My firm's done a tremendous
amount of market research.

4
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,162
We've discovered two things:

5
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:46,750
One, most Americans feel
that Christmas is a time for family.

6
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,088
Two, most Americans feel that in order
to stand being around their family,

7
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,589
for even one or two days,

8
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,718
they need to swill as much
alcohol as humanly possible.

9
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,055
Now, I'd like you
to meet the Noggertons.

10
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,099
They're a classic American family.

11
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,977
They're together on Christmas,
they're fat-free,

12
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,854
and 10 percent alcohol
by volume.

13
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:11,316
Enjoy our family, so you can
enjoy your family.

14
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,776
What do you think?

15
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,072
So, you're suggesting we tell people
the only way to get through the holidays

16
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,616
is to drink spiked egg nog?

17
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,244
I'm suggesting the only way
to get through the holidays

18
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,914
is to buy your farm-fresh, fat-free,
pre-spiked egg nog in a bottle.

19
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,212
- Take care. All right.
- It's all good. How do you do it?

20
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,965
I'm very excited.
I look forward to it.

21
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,717
It went pretty well, huh?

22
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,093
I'm a genius.

23
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,804
I feel like I could sell
whale steaks to Greenpeace.

24
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,264
Nice image.

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,350
- Here are your tickets to Fiji.
- Ah.

26
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,278
[Drew] Missy, we've been
dating a while.

27
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,739
Let's take our relationship
to the next level.

28
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,824
[Missy] I've hoped you would say that.

29
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,535
[Drew] I got you a little
pre-Christmas Christmas gift.

30
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,287
[Missy] Yeah?

31
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,417
I want you to open it now
because it involves our future.

32
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,670
The future of you and me together.

33
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,673
It's kind of for both of us,
in that way.

34
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,761
[gasps]

35
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,471
[breathless] Okay.

36
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,438
Tickets to Fiji?

37
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,857
Yes. First class.

38
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,526
Drew, on Christmas?

39
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,320
Christmas is the family holiday.

40
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,366
I mean, what are we doing? What is this?
I mean, what is going on?

41
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,868
Where is this relationship headed?

42
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,539
Fiji. First class.

43
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,292
- Missy?
- Uh-uh. Okay.

44
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,545
Here's an example
of one of our problems.

45
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,507
You never introduced me to your family.
You never mentioned your family.

46
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,967
Do you even have a family?

47
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,513
How can you be serious about me,
if you're not serious about your family?

48
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,182
You need to get some
serious help, Drew.

49
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,184
I think you're missing the point.

50
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:13,063
If I told you everything about me,
there'd be no more sense of mystery.

51
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,565
Nothing left to discover.

52
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,359
With nothing left to discover,
a relationship dies.

53
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,778
You don't want this to die, do you?

54
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,281
It just did.

55
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,119
Come on. Don't be like that.

56
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,538
You're gonna be like that?
Go ahead. Go.

57
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm going to spend Christmas
with my family.

58
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,126
You can spend Christmas alone.

59
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,339
[Drew] Missy.

60
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:03,864
Kathryn, I need you to get
a Cartier bracelet to send to Missy.

61
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,950
Something expensive,
a lot of diamonds, very flashy.

62
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,704
- Include a personal note from me.
- What exactly do you want it to say?

63
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,541
Something personal that shows
the depth of my feelings, my emotions.

64
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,712
- You're good. That's why I hired you.
- Okay, but it's not gonna work.

65
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,426
My man.

66
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,264
Oh, Dougie!

67
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
Doogan. Doog-ray.

68
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,310
Douglas.

69
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,312
It's Drew.

70
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,189
Drew Latham.
[chuckles]

71
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,024
Yeah. What's up, man?

72
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,944
What are you up?
Ah, nothin', nothin'.

73
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, man,
what're you doing for Christmas?

74
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,450
Family? Nice. Nice call.

75
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,286
Uh, you got room for one more?

76
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,582
Well, I think we are that close.

77
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,463
I love Jewish Christ...
I'll light candles, spin the dreidel.

78
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,133
It'll be great,
a matzo ball soup and baklava.

79
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,887
All right, well, that's Greek.
Fine, whatever. I'm just...

80
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,138
You still there?

81
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,518
I know you have a baby.
I'm just saying, like, you know,

82
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,896
they just lie there
and crap themselves, right?

83
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,482
After a while,
how interesting is that?

84
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,569
No, I'm not saying anything bad.
I'm just sayin'...

85
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,404
Huh?

86
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,282
Well, maybe, your wife
doesn't have to come, man.

87
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,367
Maybe it's me and you
for Christmas.

88
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,994
You ever think about that?

89
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,876
Would you mind if I came by
to your house and spent Christmas?

90
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,046
It's like one or two, three days, tops.

91
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,340
[pen scratching]

92
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,599
[sighs] All right.

93
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,268
Merry Christmas.

94
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,690
[jet engines roaring]

95
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,653
[man] Okay, right over here.
Everybody stay together.

96
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,447
All real good.
Okay, you've got Tu-Tu...

97
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,534
[Drew] Doctor Freeman!
Thank God, I found you.

98
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,118
[Freeman] Sir, sir...

99
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,580
I gotta spend Christmas alone.
I'm having a panic attack.

100
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,834
- You gotta help me. Please!
- Who are you? I don't know you.

101
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,169
I'm the boyfriend
of one of your patients.

102
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,921
- You are?
- Missy Vangilder.

103
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,757
[laughing] You're Drew.
You're Drew. Oh, God.

104
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,385
- What does that mean?
- I'm not allowed to say.

105
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,221
- How did you find me?
- I bribed a woman at your service.

106
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,724
She should raise her standards
or you gotta fire her.

107
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,518
She totally caved for 200 bucks.

108
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,478
- Whatever.
- I need a few minutes.

109
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,981
[Freeman] Backpacks on the belt.
Game Boy too.

110
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,276
You gotta help me out.
I don't wanna spend Christmas alone.

111
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,610
If you would just please!

112
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,654
She's gotta put
the bear on the belt.

113
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,239
Can't she walk it through?

114
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,074
She's got to put it on the belt.

115
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,159
- It's a puppy!
- I know it's a puppy.

116
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,161
Put Tu-Tu on
and she'll go for a ride.

117
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,622
- My Tu-Tu!
- I need one second.

118
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,957
If you could just please!

119
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,502
- Okay, gimme the puppy.
- Sir, I need you to step here.

120
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:50,215
- [Drew] You're abusing your child.
- Can you see I've got my own problems?

121
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,260
- Whoa, whoa, now.
- I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

122
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,431
Okay. Okay.
Hey, I know.

123
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,808
- Heard it on the radio once.
- All right.

124
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,853
Write down your grievances
about your family on paper.

125
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,605
- All your grievances.
- Right.

126
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,482
Go someplace that reminds you
of your childhood,

127
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,152
at sunset and light
that piece of paper on fire.

128
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,864
As the last shred of paper
is burning away, you whisper,

129
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,199
"I forgive you. "

130
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,284
- "I forgive you. "
- Mm-hm.

131
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,578
- And it burns up.
- That's it.

132
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:20,871
I like it.

133
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,956
- Oh, thanks so much!
- Whoa! All right.

134
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,667
- Have a good vaca.
- Where's my daughter?

135
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,877
- [beeping]
- Sir?

136
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,504
Huh? Oh, there she is.

137
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,465
Whoa! Hey! Come on out!
Come out for Daddy!

138
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,772
My grievances.

139
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,998
Okay, buddy, here we go.
That'll be $ 72.50.

140
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,792
My God!

141
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,585
That's it!

142
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,671
That's the house I grew up in.

143
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,841
How's the $ 72.50 comin'?

144
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,927
Good. It's comin' good.

145
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,887
Keep the meter running.

146
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,621
- [Tom] Almost out of salami.
- [Christine] No.

147
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,331
Well, thank you for telling me.

148
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,126
- I don't wanna run out, that's all.
- God forbid.

149
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,170
- Did Brian eat?
- I don't know.

150
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,714
[shouting] Get down here
and eat your dinner.

151
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,466
- I'm not hungry!
- [Tom] Yeah, you are!

152
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,261
[Christine] Stop yelling at me.

153
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,929
[Tom] I'm not yelling at you.

154
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,224
Brian!

155
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,978
[shouting] Brian!

156
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,149
Get down here please, so your father
can stop not yelling at me!

157
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,109
I'm busy!

158
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,445
We shouldn't have put
the computer in his room.

159
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,488
He's gonna spend
all his time there.

160
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,866
Oh, Tom.
Welcome to the future, dear.

161
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,451
He's advancing his skills.

162
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,662
One day that computer's
gonna get our baby a good job.

163
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,789
[beeping]

164
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,459
[music plays, woman's voice]

165
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,464
Trust me. What he's doin',
nobody's gonna pay for,

166
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,342
'cause if they did,
I'd have retired at 17.

167
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,516
- [Tom] What?
- There's a guy out there.

168
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,559
Who the hell is that?

169
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,949
[Drew] All right. Alone on Christmas.
I can do this.

170
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:07,496
[sighs] I rid myself
of all my grievances.

171
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,748
Be gone, grievances.

172
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,670
What the...

173
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,173
I forgive you.

174
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,388
Holy Moly. This joker.

175
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,265
[tires screeching]

176
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,706
What are the neighbors gonna think?

177
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,376
Unless they want to get hit, they
shouldn't be burning crap in my yard.

178
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,211
Is he still breathing?

179
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,465
Dear God, Tom.
You've killed the man.

180
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,593
Oh, shit! He's still alive!

181
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,679
[groaning] Hello.

182
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,265
[whimpers]

183
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,229
My name is Drew Latham.
[chuckles]

184
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,108
I grew up in this house.

185
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,320
That's why you came back and
tried to burn it down, Pyroboy?

186
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,488
- Brian, call the cops.
- Oh, no, no, no!

187
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:27,201
That won't be necessary. That's fine.
I was just outside burning,

188
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,828
someone told me to burn
a list of my grievances

189
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,373
outside of the home of my birth
to help me with loneliness issues.

190
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,876
- So, it's all fine.
- Oh.

191
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,922
Any-hoo, apologies
and I'm gonna go.

192
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,383
Would you mind terribly
if I took a look-see around the house?

193
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,886
- I'll give you a tour.
- [Drew] Oh, thank you.

194
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,388
Hold on.

195
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,141
- You got any more matches?
- No. No, no, no.

196
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,643
Are we done with all that?

197
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,102
Yes. The burning. Yes.

198
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,772
It's completely done.
I'm actually better.

199
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,273
I'm watching you.

200
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,655
Wow. I can't believe it!

201
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,407
This is amazing!
It's exactly how I remember it.

202
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,870
- You mean it was always a shithole?
- No. No, it's great.

203
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,503
[squeak]

204
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,506
- Did you hear that?
- [squeaking]

205
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,883
That stair squeaked.

206
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,636
Do you know what we
used to call that squeaky stair?

207
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,806
"The squeaky stair. "
[laughing]

208
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,142
- [squeaking]
- [laughing]

209
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,280
Wow. My old room.

210
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,781
My God.

211
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,076
Hey, look at that!
I can touch the ceiling.

212
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,538
It's much smaller than I remember it.
Did you do something?

213
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,332
Yeah. We had it reduced.

214
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,919
Cost a lot, but yeah,
I think it was...

215
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,462
I think it was worth it.

216
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,756
Man, this is great.
Man, this is the best.

217
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,302
You guys sittin' around
eatin' dinner like a family.

218
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,346
I always wanted that.
This is really wonderful.

219
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,224
[Brian] Wonderful.

220
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,476
So, what's for dessert?

221
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,188
- Kitchen's closed.
- Aw.

222
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,315
- Yeah, I got things to do.
- Ah, boy.

223
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,775
Tom, why don't you
see the man out?

224
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,486
I didn't want to let him in.
I'll call you a cab.

225
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,530
Is that necessary?

226
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,865
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

227
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,534
But you know, man,
I gotta tell ya,

228
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,162
all these years I've been
avoiding Christmas,

229
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,458
and I just realized,
this is what I've been longing for.

230
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,836
A real family, you know?
In a true home.

231
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,547
That's why I'm thinking

232
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,592
it might be a good idea
if I lived with you.

233
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,802
- [Drew grunts]
- [door slams]

234
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,671
[Drew knocking] Tom! Tom!

235
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,424
Tom, please!
Please let me stay here!

236
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,509
No.

237
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,512
- I'll pay you.
- My family's not for sale, pal.

238
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,306
Tom, I'll pay you $250,000.

239
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,601
Welcome home, son.

240
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,187
[splashing]

241
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,814
Mom.

242
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,530
Tom, that guy is still here.

243
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,408
- Yeah, I know.
- Why is he still here?

244
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,788
He's givin' us $250,000
to be his family for Christmas.

245
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,125
And you agreed to this?
Without asking me?

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,879
Of course I did.
He's giving us $250,000.

247
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,048
How would you like it if I
agreed to this without asking you?

248
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,135
Well, that would depend.
Would we be getting $250,000?

249
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,974
Okay. What exactly
did you agree to?

250
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,270
[sighs]

251
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,196
It's a big day for this family.

252
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,156
- Very well.
- All right.

253
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,118
Mr. Latham agrees
to pay the sum of $250,000

254
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:43,749
to the Valcos for services rendered
until 11:59 pm on Christmas Day.

255
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,627
And for said sum, the Valco family

256
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,005
will aid Mr. Latham in recapturing

257
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,175
those childhood Christmas memories,

258
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,969
- including, but not limited to,
- [sighs]

259
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:00,682
all due festiveness, celebrations,
various and sundry merriments,

260
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,851
and yuletide glee.

261
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,020
Agreed!

262
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,064
Agreed, right?

263
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,358
Fakin' it anyway.
Might as well get paid.

264
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,235
Will there be anything else?

265
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,529
Oh, yeah. I gotta sleep
in Brian's room.

266
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,657
What? No.
Where is this going here?

267
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,952
Like it says in the contract.
I get to sleep in my old room.

268
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,956
Oh, come on. Creepy grievance guy
wants to sleep in my room?

269
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,918
If I wanted that, I'd use a bus ticket
those guys send me on the Internet.

270
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,963
I just wanna sleep in my room,
like it says in the contract.

271
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,173
Brian, you're in the guest room.

272
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,344
My computer's not in the guest room.
How am I supposed to... study?

273
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,304
Use your imagination.

274
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,099
Well, I'm gonna
catch some shut-eye.

275
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,270
Who wants to go Christmas tree
shopping with me in the morning?

276
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,650
Apparently, you all do.

277
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,027
[birds chirping]

278
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,741
[yawns]

279
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,047
I'm home.

280
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,062
Oh!

281
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,149
[Christine] Brian? Brian!

282
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,109
[Brian] I didn't do it.

283
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,402
[Drew] It's all right.

284
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,323
[chuckling] I'll fix it.
I'll fix it. Ow.

285
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,082
[Tom] Well, that should do it,
assuming no other idiot...

286
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,132
Is he eatin' my salami?

287
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,384
That's what it looks like.

288
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,641
- It's 9:00 in the mornin'.
- Oh, I know. It's not breakfast food,

289
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,060
but it was lookin' good.
I had to dog some.

290
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,729
Yeah, it is good.

291
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,982
- Is that the last of it?
- Yep.

292
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,039
Oh. You didn't want some, did ya?

293
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,834
No. It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.

294
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,418
Ah.

295
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,382
[Drew] Kathryn, I hope
you're checking messages.

296
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,176
Should anyone need to reach me,
they can call my cell.

297
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,803
If you need to send anything,

298
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:47,474
the address is 2 Edgewood Road
in Lincoln Wood, Illinois.

299
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,518
Stayin' with my family.

300
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,895
Hey, Dad?

301
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,150
He's talkin' to you, genius.

302
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,529
Yeah, Drew?

303
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:06,118
Would you do me a kindness?
Put this hat on.

304
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,454
My dad used to wear a Santa hat
when we went Christmas tree shopping.

305
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,581
[laughter]

306
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,499
- In public?
- Yeah.

307
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,126
That would be no.

308
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,462
And in private,
that would be no, too.

309
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,214
Please wear the hat.

310
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,551
No. I'm not wearing the hat.

311
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,803
Tom, you gotta wear the hat.

312
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,306
- I'm not wearin' the hat.
- Wear the hat, Tom.

313
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,184
Now get it away from me
before I shove it up your ass.

314
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:36,231
Tom, are you familiar
with the phrase "breach of contract?"

315
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,364
- Give me the hat.
- All right.

316
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:48,785
$250,000. $250,000.

317
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,039
- $250,000.
- [Brian chuckling]

318
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,582
You're lookin' good, Dad.

319
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,417
- [Christine] Tom!
- Shut up!

320
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,377
Eyes on the road.
On the road. Dad.

321
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,046
- Gimme your leg.
- [screeching]

322
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,089
[Drew] No.

323
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,678
Nope.

324
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,472
Oh, wait a minute.

325
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,474
This could be it.
This could be it.

326
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,893
Yep. This is it.
This is the one.

327
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,229
[Drew] You're good.
Excuse me, folks.

328
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,151
Dad, you wanna lift that up,
have respect for the tree? No?

329
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,862
It's gonna be in our house, so...

330
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,657
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are we going with this?

331
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,245
All right. Let's get that baby up there,
hoist that up.

332
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,789
- Get that on the roof.
- [Tom grunts]

333
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,624
All righty.

334
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,294
[Drew] That's pretty good. All right!
You got it. There you go.

335
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,255
Get around it.
Get around on it.

336
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,548
[Tom straining]

337
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:46,051
Brian, get your skinny little ass
out of the car!

338
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,928
[Drew] You got it, Dad.
You got it.

339
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,555
You got it.

340
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,308
Nice one. All right, I think it's good.
I think it's good like that.

341
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,395
Whoo! Christmas time.

342
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,903
- [Drew] How's it look?
- [Brian] It could trigger a seizure.

343
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,531
I know.
Wait till you see it lit up.

344
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,949
I thought it was lit up.

345
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,159
Oh no, no, no.

346
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,829
We gotta sing "Christmas Tree" first.
Tom, you take the lead.

347
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,457
- You want me to sing?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,627
Do I have to?

349
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,004
Yeah.

350
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,299
Would it make any difference
if I didn't want to?

351
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,508
Not really.

352
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,721
Come on.

353
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,808
<i>Oh, Christmas tree</i>

354
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,394
Christine, you wanna
help me out here a little?

355
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,438
No, you're doin' great.

356
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:43,483
You're doin' good, Dad.
Come on. You can do it.

357
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,699
<i>[both] "Oh, Christmas tree"
Oh, Christmas tree</i>

358
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:54,244
<i>You stand in woodland beauty</i>

359
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,163
<i>You are as green</i>

360
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,081
- "As winter snow"
- "As summer snow"

361
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,459
- Winter snow.
- "Winter snow"

362
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,087
<i>As in summer's brightest glow</i>

363
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:09,426
<i>Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree</i>

364
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:14,723
<i>You stand in woodland beauty</i>

365
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,517
<i>Ahhh</i>

366
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,851
That was great.

367
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,437
- [Drew] That was good.
- [Tom] That was, yeah.

368
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,522
All right.

369
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:26,401
Without further ado, let's fire it up.
Ready? One, two...

370
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,737
- [knocking]
- [groans]

371
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,240
All right, people.
Take five. I'll deal with this.

372
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,200
Thank Christ.

373
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,161
Can I help you?

374
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,791
Yeah. Who are you?

375
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,543
Um, who are you?

376
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,336
[Christine] Alicia!

377
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,672
Hey, Mom. Hi. Who's this?

378
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,966
Mom, who is this?

379
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,759
Okay, what's going on?

380
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:54,137
Dad's rented us for the holidays
to this eccentric millionaire.

381
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,599
[Drew] You have a daughter?
Since when do you have a daughter?

382
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,978
- It's her terrible secret.
- This is gonna ruin everything.

383
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,564
- The whole bit doesn't work.
- Ruin? Know what?

384
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:07,526
Shh. Will somebody say something
that makes some sense right now?

385
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,903
Well, around Christmas,
I get anxiety...

386
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,322
No, no. You stop talking. Mom?

387
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,617
Drew wants a family Christmas,
so we're gonna be his family.

388
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,494
- That's insane.
- Tell me about it.

389
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,330
I never had a sister,
so this is bullshit right here.

390
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,958
Okay. You are my
illegitimate love child.

391
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,460
- Mom!
- And you had no idea about her.

392
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,462
That could be good.
You know what?

393
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,840
- She could be the maid!
- Okay. Enough.

394
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,675
Hey, my baby's home.

395
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,635
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you, Lissi?

396
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,972
Hi. I'm good.
You've obviously lost your mind.

397
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,600
Can I talk to you
in the dining room, please?

398
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:40,851
You knew about this?

399
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,437
- Stay away from my daughter.
- Okay, Mom?

400
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,606
- This guy is obviously crazy.
- I know.

401
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,983
So, I'm gonna go upstairs,
and take a bath,

402
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,361
and when I wake up in the morning,
he's gonna be gone, right?

403
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,696
Maybe.

404
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,449
I'm not gonna be a good sport
about this, Mom.

405
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,035
Oh, darling, we'd never
expect you to be.

406
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,121
Thanks.

407
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,790
[Drew] Come on, Mom!
It's tree time!

408
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,755
[Drew] Okey-dokey.

409
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,216
All right.
We're back on track.

410
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,679
Yeah.

411
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,974
Okay.

412
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:25,229
Here we go.
One, two, three!

413
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,317
[Drew] Now it feels like Christmas.

414
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,903
[Brian] I can smell
my eyeballs burning.

415
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,989
[Drew] Very important.
Don't look directly at the tree.

416
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,699
[dog barking]

417
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,251
- Brian!
- What?

418
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,294
Wake up!
It's your brother, kind of!

419
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,713
It's snowing outside!
It's a snow day!

420
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,508
Why are you waking me up?

421
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,969
I don't want you
to miss the fun, man!

422
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,013
What fun?

423
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:04,309
[Drew] Oh! Facial! Iceball!
Whoo! Ha ha!

424
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,436
Look out! Oh!

425
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,230
Right in the nuts!
In the nuts!

426
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,274
- I can't feel my toes.
- Here he comes.

427
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,485
The look of vengeance.
Eye of the tiger.

428
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,445
Oh, oh.
Now he's getting furious.

429
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,406
Whoo! Whoo!

430
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,909
- Whoo!
- [door closing]

431
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,665
- What's up, Tom?
- Brian, go inside.

432
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,502
See you later, Bri.
It was fun.

433
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,462
You like throwing snowballs?

434
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,840
I was just havin' a good time.
You know.

435
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,134
Yeah. Throw one at me.

436
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,511
That's cool.
Don't worry about it.

437
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,138
We're kinda finished now.

438
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,390
Come on.
Like you said, it'll be fun.

439
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,268
It's getting a little chilly.
I don't wanna bother.

440
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,229
- Don't worry about it.
- Ah, come on. Throw it.

441
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,983
All right, I'll throw one,
I'll throw one.

442
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,408
Good one.

443
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,453
Now it's my turn.

444
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,707
No!

445
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,462
That was great.

446
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,756
Any time you wanna do that,
let me know.

447
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,758
We said no iceballs, man.

448
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,635
Oh, did we?

449
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,304
Morning, Mom.

450
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,014
Freak.

451
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,850
You know what?

452
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,230
We may have gotten off
on the wrong track.

453
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,648
We should start over.

454
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,566
- Here you go, Drew.
- Thanks, Mom.

455
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,568
- Mmm.
- Problem?

456
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:40,197
My real mom puts marshmallows
in the hot chocolate.

457
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,408
Know what I was thinking?
If you don't wanna play my sister,

458
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,495
maybe you could be, like,
a wonderful, mysterious

459
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,414
Ecuadorean cleaning lady.
You know?

460
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,376
Or Swedish cleaning lady.
The ethnicity's not important.

461
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,087
But cleaning lady's good.
Oh. Mmm.

462
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:56,672
What?

463
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,842
My real mom used the
mini-marshmallows. Sorry.

464
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:04,513
Speaking of your mom, why aren't you
annoying your own family?

465
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:07,599
That's not really your business,
is it, Consuela?

466
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,567
[Drew] Ho, ho, ho!

467
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,903
All righty.
Welcome, everyone.

468
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,365
- Here you are.
- What is this?

469
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,994
These are what we
in the business call scripts, Tom.

470
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,830
- Excuse me?
- You don't have to worry about it.

471
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,957
Your role is what we call "small. "

472
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:35,711
Well, you're what we
in real life call "a jackass. "

473
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,755
I don't know about that,
but I do know that my being here

474
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,842
may have caused some awkwardness
within the family.

475
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,428
- You think?
- [Drew] I do, Tom. Seriously.

476
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,098
And it's even possible
that some of it could potentially be

477
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,434
in some small way
partly my fault.

478
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,895
Which part wasn't your fault?

479
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,439
Bop, bop, bop, bop.
I'm talking. Okay?

480
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,817
So what I've done is I went
ahead and wrote a sequence,

481
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,070
so you guys can get a sense
of what I'm going for here.

482
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:04,740
And we're all gonna
read this aloud.

483
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,118
- I feel like I'm insane.
- That's why you have no lines.

484
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,871
- Mom, I believe you go first.
- Okay.

485
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,831
"Oh, look at us.

486
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,752
I sure hope you like the meal
I so lovingly prepared

487
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,795
for the people I love.

488
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:22,216
She smiles at Tom. "
Oh, she's...

489
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,844
[Drew] Have you acted?
You've acted before.

490
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,721
- A little theater.
- I can tell.

491
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,266
- I see it. It comes out.
- You were in "Pippin" in high school.

492
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,894
You played Wind.

493
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,313
Tom, you have the next line.

494
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,106
Uh...

495
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,610
"Say thank you to your mother
for all her hard work cooking for us. "

496
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,071
"Thank you. "

497
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,657
"Oh, I don't work nearly
as hard as you, dear. "

498
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,991
Well, that's true.

499
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,119
Tom, let's stay on book, please.
Brian, go ahead.

500
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:54,915
"Gee, Mom, I love you
like the dickens.

501
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,000
Should we pray?"

502
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:00,462
Gee, Beav, do you think Wally's
gonna give you the business?

503
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,006
Oh, there you are, Consuela.

504
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,760
<i>Five waters for everyone, please.
Gracias.</i>

505
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,972
[clears throat] Brian,
you were about to say grace.

506
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:15,477
- "Dear God... "
- Brian. We hold hands at grace.

507
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,524
[Brian] "Dear God,

508
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,984
thank you for this meal.

509
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,111
Thank you for blessing us
with a family.

510
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,863
Not everyone has a nice family.

511
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,656
And also we, O Lord,

512
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,076
are so lucky to have Drew
in our lives. "

513
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,870
Amen.

514
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,498
"An emotional moment. "

515
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,500
Sorry, I keep doing that.

516
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:42,087
"Brian, if you eat it all up,
I will let you sleep with me

517
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,340
like I never did
when you were little. "

518
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,970
An awkward moment.

519
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,972
Skip ahead.
That doesn't work.

520
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,975
- That's not supposed to be there.
- What does this mean?

521
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,060
"Doo-Dah enters
in his bathrobe. "

522
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:01,106
Sweet Jim Jiminy!
Cold corn in the mornin'!

523
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:05,694
- This weather is killin' my joints.
- Brian, go get the shovel.

524
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,615
[Drew] Listen to me. When Alicia came,
she totally ruined everything.

525
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,159
Everything was so normal
up until that point.

526
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,577
<i>Silencio, por favor.</i>

527
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,955
So I realized what I had to do
was expand the family.

528
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,833
I had to find my grandpa.
So I went and found my Doo-Dah.

529
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,085
Here he is. My Doo-Dah.

530
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:25,881
Your Doo-Dah looks exactly like the guy
in "Christmas Carol. " Scrooge.

531
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,217
That's right.
I do community theater.

532
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,345
And this Christmas night,
I'm reprising my role as Scrooge

533
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,056
in the Lincoln Wood
Theater Group's production

534
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,892
of "A Christmas Carol. "
I hope you all can make it.

535
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,520
Please stay in character, Saul, okay?

536
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,396
"I'm so glad that you came here.

537
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,191
You're gonna stay for
the whole Christmas holiday. "

538
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,361
Whoa, no, he's not.
I agreed to let you in the house,

539
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:50,239
- not Doo-Doo over here.
- Doo-Dah.

540
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,699
- Nobody's talkin' to you.
- [groans] Look.

541
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,576
I'll give you $25,000.

542
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,413
How you doin', Doo-Dah?

543
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,249
You can stay in the living room.

544
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,668
No, Dad, I'm sleeping
in the living room.

545
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,169
Not anymore.

546
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,839
Where am I gonna sleep?

547
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,924
[dog barking]

548
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,054
Ow.

549
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,973

00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,623
Mom, you wanna stick
with Doo-Dah?

555
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,085
- Why me?
- He's your father.

556
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,213
- [Doo-Dah] How come you never call?
- Tom! Tom! Tom!

557
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,923
Yes, Drew?

558
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,801
Aren't you forgettin' something, T-Bone?

559
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,472
Here you go, Lenny.
Happy holidays to you.

560
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,391
- [Lenny] You too.
- Hey, Tommy!

561
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,476
[laughing] Nice hat.

562
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:05,355
- How's the holidays?
- Considering I got a pain in my ass

Oh, relatives, huh?

565
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,195
- Kinda.
- Oh, your wife's family.

566
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,490
They hang around your house
all day and drink your beer.

567
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,451
They eat your salami.

568
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:22,080

in a Christmas cookie?

580
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,592
I can't. I'm diabetic.

That dog won't hunt, my friend.

582
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,347
Doo-Dah wasn't diabetic.
Go ahead and take one.

583
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,307
Look, kid, I get that.

584
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,227

That's not what we talked about.

- We can't do this no more.

What? Why?
Is it my fault? Something I did?

608
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,083
Is it the hat? Forget it.
Wear whatever you want, Tom.

609
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,294

It's nothin' to do with you.

610

It's been goin' on for a long time.
We're just... It's not workin' out.

611
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,677

and with your Christmas cheer crap,
it's making it worse.

614
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,728
Tom, first of all,
I wanna reward you for opening up

615
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,481
with a big "thank you,"
that deserves some credit.

616
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:55,359
Second, let me tell you
what you need to do.

617
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,402
If I was you
and comin' into some money,

618
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:01,365
I'd do somethin' big, somethin'
you always wanted your whole life.

Somethin' that makes you happy.

620
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:07,663
I want the money. I really do.
It's Christine, she keeps...

621
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,290
All right. Let me worry
about Christine, okay?

622
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,125
I'll worry about Christine.

623
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:15,254

- Can I talk to you?
- Of course, dear. I'm your mother.

626
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,179
You can talk to me
about anything.

627
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:25,472

00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,892
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

629
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,437
You sure? 'Cause you just put

633
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,535

I just wanna say that

634
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:49,788
I'm feeling a little ripped off here,
you know?

635
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,708
I thought I was getting a real family.
This is bullshit.

636
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,794
Well, it's time you grew up
and faced facts, isn't it?

637
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,922
Mommies and daddies

00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,223
Second of all,

640
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,894
I was thinkin' I could do something
to help you, make you feel better.

641
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,937
How about just me and you
go shopping?

642
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:17,274
- For what?
- I don't know. Just go shopping.

643
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,860
You know what I mean?
It's fun just to buy shit.

647
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,371
You don't see it, do you?

648
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:35,042
You don't see what
a beautiful woman you are.

649
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:39,630
You have grace and kindness
and sensuality,

650
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,924
and this incredibly striking,

651
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:45,219
kind of offbeat beauty that's...

652
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:48,430
You look in the mirror, and don't
see it. We're gonna show you.

653
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,933

Oh, I'm sorry, Drew.
Have I been sending you mixed signals?

664
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:35,477
[chuckles] I just thought
maybe instead of sitting around

665
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:38,522

you might like to have some fun.

666

No, thanks.

667
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,651
[Drew] Ah, I see.

668
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,820
I get it.

669
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,906
You're afraid of fun.
You don't like having fun.

670
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,826
What the hell does that even mean,
"I don't like fun"?

671
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,411
Of course I like fun.

Everybody likes fun. It's fun.

00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,041
All right, so then why

00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:09,481
[stammers] I can't believe you did this.

847
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:11,400
Wait till you see this.

848
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:12,818
Hit it, guys.

849
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:17,072
[elves] Hut, hut, hut...

850
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:26,748
- [elves giggling]
- [camel grunts]

851
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:33,839
[donkey brays]

852
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:35,215
You see that?

853
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,759
That's you right there.
I know this props guy.

854
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,678
He owns a prop house with figurines,

855
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:42,306
and he painted your hair like that,
your mouth.

856
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:44,391
- Those guys aren't pros.
- I'm sure.

857
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,935
- I showed them the thing.
- Oh, wow.

858
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,397
I got this dance teacher.
It's not easy to get a camel.

859
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:54,735
It's not easy taking a very
personal and private moment

860
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:58,530
that I have never told anybody
and turning it into a theme park.

861
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,449
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

862
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:01,867
Shut up!

863
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:03,869
[choir] Ah...

864
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,955
But I'm not disappointed.
Okay? I'm not mad.

865
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,960
I'm just mad at myself for thinking that
there was more to you than I thought.

866
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:15,839
- That's you.
- [man] It's a wrap.

867
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:17,841
[elves] Hut, hut, hut.

868
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:19,635
[Drew] Alicia? Wait a second!

869
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:23,555
I care about you.
I did that because I care about you.

870
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,016
Look, Drew,
let me just give you some advice.

871
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,477
Save your big, expensive gestures

872
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:30,813
for some girl
who's impressed by them,

873
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:33,023
And when you find her,
hold on to her.

874
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:36,568
Otherwise, you are looking at
a lifetime of lonely Christmases.

875
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:49,039
I'm telling you, he is wonderful.

876
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,625
It's Cartier.
At least he's got manners.

877
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,836
Well, I mean,
he's in the neighborhood.

878
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,420
- He is?
- Darling.

879
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:57,381
- What?
- It's a day bracelet.

880
00:54:57,506 --> 00:55:00,259
- Do you like it, darling?
- I love it.

881
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:01,969
You're the expert on jewelry.

882
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,137
- Are you disagreeing?
- Absolutely not.

883
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,682
She just got a present.
Why pick at her now?

884
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:07,724
I'm not.

885
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,021
[knocking]

886
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:16,150
Brian, tell Drew
that I had to take off.

887
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,985
There was a...

888
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:24,616
Holy cow.
What are you looking at?

889
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:28,453
This is just, it's research.

890
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,706
When I was young,
we didn't sit in our rooms

891
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,167
drooling over nude ladies
on computers.

892
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,710
No, sir.

893
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:37,129
We had to go behind the barn
with the dirty girl

894
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:40,966
and pay her a quarter so she
could show us her goodies.

895
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:43,552
How does this work?

896
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:47,389
Oh, well. Here, let me...

897
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:50,225
[Brian] What are you into?
Hot Cheerleaders,

898
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:52,060
- Three-Way Fun.
- Uh-uh.

899
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,938
- Middle-Aged Hotties.
- You're talkin' my language.

900
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:59,902
Old enough to know how it's done,
young enough to still want to do it.

901
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:02,488
- That's gross.
- Ooh.

902
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:04,281
[Doo-Dah] Come to papa.

903
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:06,617
[Brian] That's not bad, right?

904
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,289
Dude, it's your mom!

905
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:13,540
Oh, my God.

906
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,377
Hey, can you print that for me?

907
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:20,756
Mom, Dad, listen.

908
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:22,466
Please, Drew has to go tonight.

909
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,385
I cannot spend one more second
in this house with him.

910
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,554
- Well, yeah?
- Yeah? So what?

911
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,098
So he's making fools of us!

912
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,934
- Of all of us!
- [Drew] Alicia?

913
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,812
[sighs] All right, look,
I'm gonna take the car,

914
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:37,272
and when I get home,
I really hope he's gone.

915
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:40,692
- Alicia.
- Be careful with the car.

916
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:42,528
Can't we talk about this?

917
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,613
No.

918
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:50,118
- What the hell happened?
- [Drew] Nothing.

919
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:53,080
I think she's right. It's stupid.

920
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:54,540
This is a mistake.

921
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:57,626
I've imposed on you folks
and I'm sorry.

922
00:56:57,709 --> 00:56:59,253
I'll write you a check.

923
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:02,005
I'll spend Christmas...

924
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,466
I'll spend Christmas somewhere.

925
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:08,387
No. We don't want your money.

926
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:12,391
In cash.
Check'll be just fine.

927
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,852
- I'll get you a pen.
- [phone rings]

928
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:17,146
- What's wrong with you?
- Hello?

929
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,648
- "Merry Christmas to you too. "
- Missy!

930
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,734
The bracelet is amazing, Drew.
Thank you.

931
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,029
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

932
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:31,201
- How'd you know my favorite is Cartier?
- Lucky guess. How did you find me?

933
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:35,289
I talked to your secretary and she said
you were with your family.

934
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:36,665
Oh, Drew!

935
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:40,252
I am so happy for you.
And for us.

936
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,379
- For us?
- "I know what this means,"

937
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:44,464
<i>reaching out to your family.</i>

938
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,758
You want to be
more serious about yourself,

939
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:49,011
and more serious about me.

940
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,805
I wanna meet your family, Drew.

941
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,641
I'm sure you will,
and they wanna meet you one day.

942
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,310
Oh, great.

943
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:58,645
Then we can go to Fiji.

944
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:01,398
How about tomorrow?

945
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:04,359
Fiji? Tomorrow?
You're kidding.

946
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:07,571
That's fabulous, actually.
That's perfect.

947
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:12,576
Then tonight we can spend Christmas Eve
together with our families.

948
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,661
Ah...

949
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:17,998
That's gonna be hard
to pull off, you know?

950
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:22,753
It's very short notice, and we...

951
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:28,217
One of the family members
is challenged, and...

952
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:31,929
[clears throat]... requires
a lot of time to put on

953
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,264
- the proper headgear...
- Oh. No problem.

954
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,558
- [seatbelts unlatching]
- We're here.

955
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,061
- You're here?
- Look outside!

956
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:49,196
Oh, my God!
You're here?!

957
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:54,409
I mean, oh, my gosh!
You're totally here!

958
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,163
My girlfriend's family is here!

959
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,749
You have to help me!
Pretend for a couple hours!

960
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:03,001
We'll leave by midnight.
I'm begging you!

961
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,420
Read paragraph three.
You bailed, it's done.

962
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:08,966
- You write the check and get out!
- What? No! Wait a minute!

963
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,343
Okay, look, I wanna go!
I'm dying to go!

964
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:13,929
I gotta have a life to go back to!
This girl is it!

965
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:16,139
I can't tell her I rented a family.

966
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,433
I'm sure she already knows
you're crazy.

967
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,603
- It kinda shows.
- A deal's a deal. That's it.

968
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:24,898
- Unless you sweeten the pot.
- That's extortion, Tom!

969
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,442
- I think I hear the doorbell.
- No! No, no! Wait!

970
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:30,863
No, no! I'll give you
another 75 grand. Okay?

971
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,990
But you gotta do it good,
you gotta try.

972
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,200
Or else I'll be so mad
at you guys!

973
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:36,702
- [doorbell]
- Come on.

974
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,246
- I'm not wearin' the hat.
- [Drew] Fine! Sure!

975
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:42,791
- Missy!
- Hey, Drew.

976
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,710
Mrs. Vangilder. Captain.

977
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:45,836
Come on in.

978
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:48,255
Merry Christmas.
Honey. Merry Christmas.

979
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,382
Welcome to my childhood home.

980
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:51,800
[chuckling] Come on in.

981
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:53,010
- Hi.
- Hello.

982
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:55,345
I'm Drew's father,
and this is his mother.

983
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:56,471
- Christine.
- Mom.

984
00:59:56,597 --> 00:59:57,639
Letitia. Horace.

985
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:00,392
And he's our son.
There's no doubt about that.

986
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:02,561
[Drew chuckling] That's for sure.

987
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:05,105
[awkward silence]

988
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:14,823
Oh!

989
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:18,827
I would love to see pictures of Drew
when he was small.

990
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,914
Oh, we're not gonna bore everyone,
that's embarrassing.

991
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:23,874
Good idea.
Bath time for baby.

992
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,334
- Oh.
- [chuckling]

993
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:28,295
- Thanks, Mom.
- Look at him.

994
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,963
Drew, are you sure that's you?

995
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,424
Oh, that's me all right.
I remember it well.

996
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,843
That was in autumn
and the photographer...

997
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:38,847
No, I don't think so.
There's no little dingle.

998
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,683
- Nope.
- No.

999
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:43,936
[Drew] Yes. It's there, but it's not...

1000
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:48,690
You can't see it, because it was
so long that Mom had to tuck it back

1001
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:50,901
when she gave me a bath.
It got tangled.

1002
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,820
- You remember, Mom.
- Yeah, yeah.

1003
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:55,155
From the moment he was born, it was...

1004
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,534
- ... freakishly long.
- [chuckling] Right. Yes.

1005
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,952
- [knocking]
- I'll get it.

1006
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,370
No, no, no!

1007
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,539
I'll get it, son.
You stay right there.

1008
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,624
[chuckling] Thanks, Dad.

1009
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,709
- So, here we are.
- Yeah.

1010
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:11,421
So are we keeping you folks
from dinner plans, or...

1011
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:13,257
No, we don't have any plans.

1012
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:15,050
We couldn't possibly impose.

1013
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,052
[Horace] We just got here.

1014
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:19,680
Oh, okay.
Who was that, Dad?

1015
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,808
Doo-Dah.

1016
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:25,310
Doo-Dah.
Doo-Dah's my grandpa.

1017
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,771
- He'll tell us stories...
- I wanna meet him.

1018
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,898
...about the 1800s.
I know you do.

1019
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:32,276
We don't usually
leave him outside.

1020
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:34,361
We usually let him in, Dad.

1021
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,405
- Let's talk, son.
- [Drew] Okay.

1022
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,323
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

1023
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,659
This guy says he's Doo-Dah's understudy.

1024
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,704
- He's not white.
- That's fine, just let him in.

1025
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,330
They don't know he's not right.

1026
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,583
- They don't know him!
- Want me to let him in?

1027
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,792
- Fine!
- Please, Tom.

1028
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,420
This is my grandfather, Doo-Dah.
Here he is.

1029
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,131
Sweet Jim Jiminy,
cold corn in the mornin'!

1030
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:55,841
Ooh. Who are you?

1031
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,510
I'm Saul's understudy.
I just came to help out.

1032
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,220
[understudy] "Feliz navidad. "

1033
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:03,098
- Is he black?
- Yep.

1034
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:07,769
I can't do it.
I cannot do it.

1035
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:11,356
My family's this close to 350.
You're not gonna weasel out now!

1036
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,775
Put some maple syrup
on the ham.

1037
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:24,369
- Drew?
- Huh?

1038
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:26,079
Ah! Ah!

1039
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,666
I'm sorry!
Oh, Jesus!

1040
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,127
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

1041
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:35,214
I'm gonna leave right away.
I don't want to cause problems.

1042
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,966
- Drew, listen.
- I'm in a bit of a jam now.

1043
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:41,386
- Drew, Drew, wait.
- What? Yes?

1044
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:45,224
I came back here because
I wanted to apologize to you.

1045
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:48,727
Yes, the thing in the park
was a bit garish and obnoxious,

1046
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,479
but that's you.

1047
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,523
Not that you're garish and obnoxious,

1048
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:54,858
it's just that you
do things in a big way.

1049
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,527
Yes, I do, I do.

1050
01:02:56,652 --> 01:02:59,196
And I'm touched.

1051
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:02,908
- Thank you. That means...
- And thank you.

1052
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:16,171
You smell like fear.

1053
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,218
- There have been some developments...
- I have a gift for you.

1054
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,303
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1055
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,225
No! Hi!

1056
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,935
[laughing] Hi, honey.

1057
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,396
Your mom sent me in here
to get a cheeseball.

1058
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:36,984
- What's that?
- This is a cheeseball.

1059
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:40,946
Let's play a game where you don't
come back till they eat the whole thing.

1060
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,783
[chuckling] This is great.
Your family isn't what I expected.

1061
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,869
I'm glad you wanted to introduce me.

1062
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:48,871
- It's all I ever wanted.
- Me too.

1063
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:51,165
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. All right.

1064
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:52,958
Yes. I know.
I love you. Okay.

1065
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:56,920
- Fiji's gonna be great.
- It will be great. Fiji time!

1066
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:06,096
That's what this was about?
You put us through this for a girl?

1067
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,515
No, no, no.

1068
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,184
Just...

1069
01:04:12,102 --> 01:04:15,063
- Can I open my present now?
- Sure.

1070
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:20,944
I thought this was because
you had a painful childhood.

1071
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,447
I'm sorry. You said you
never wanted to see me,

1072
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,616
so I accepted that.

1073
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:29,661
I was broken up with her, but she
showed up and wanted to meet my family.

1074
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,539
I couldn't tell them
it was a rented family.

1075
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:36,543
I know you hate me. I hate me.
I hate my own guts.

1076
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:39,463
I know this is horrible,
but would you just please,

1077
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:41,840
could you help me,
so I can get through this?

1078
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,843
You'll never see me again.
Just take a ride for an hour.

1079
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,137
Your parents will call you
when it's clear.

1080
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:51,433
[Christine] Drew,
your dad wants more salami!

1081
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:52,768
They're playing along?

1082
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:57,231
Your parents, they're crazy.
They think it's fun.

1083
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,107
I'm sorry.
Okay? I gotta go.

1084
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,109
I'll see you.
I miss you. Thank you.

1085
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,487
You're welcome. See ya.

1086
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,701
They think it's fun, huh?

1087
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:14,706
Maybe they're right.

1088
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,543
Your tree, Christine, it's so colorful.

1089
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,212
You know, it reminds me of Mexico.

1090
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:24,758
Not the better hotels, but the colors
of the simple people.

1091
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,135
It's so bright and vulgar.

1092
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,430
- [chuckles]
- Mom! Dad! I'm home!

1093
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:34,935
[Christine] Alicia, you're back.
You're back, Alicia.

1094
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,854
Oh, you're back.

1095
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:40,274
This is our daughter, Alicia.
This is Mrs. Vangilder.

1096
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:42,442
Please. Letitia.

1097
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:45,112
I'm so pleased to meet you. Really.

1098
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,114
And this is our little Missy.

1099
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,284
Oh, Missy, Missy.

1100
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:55,706
Oh, gosh. I've just heard
so much about you from Drew.

1101
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:58,208
God, you're gorgeous.

1102
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:02,004
And you are so not fat.
Drew! What's the matter with you?

1103
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,672
I'm sorry?

1104
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,632
- Drew, I'm not fat.
- No.

1105
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:08,677
- I was just thinking that.
- You must be Mr. Vangilder.

1106
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:10,888
- I would never say that.
- Don't mind us.

1107
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,347
We're a bunch of kidders.

1108
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,308
I like the family.

1109
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,977
Oh, well, you obviously
haven't met Brian.

1110
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,022
By the way, where is Brian?

1111
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:26,445
[whimpering]

1112
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:32,201
Here.

1113
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:35,454
Your mom's startin' to like
your grandfather hittin' on her.

1114
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:38,248
There's one you don't often hear
on Christmas Eve.

1115
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,458
[Missy laughing]

1116
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:42,419
It's unbelievable.
Poor thing. Poor thing.

1117
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,671
- Excuse me.
- It's true.

1118
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:47,257
What's happening over here?
What's going on?

1119
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:50,928
- I'm learning so much from your sister.
- Oh, you are. Great.

1120
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:53,347
I didn't know you were
a baton twirler.

1121
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,517
Yeah. Gave away the big secret,
I guess, didn't you?

1122
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,019
Oh, not the big one,
so don't push me.

1123
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,522
Let's go talk to Doo-Dah.
He's telling stor...

1124
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:03,649
I want you to see
the bracelet Drew got me.

1125
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:06,652
Ooh, Cartier, huh?

1126
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:08,946
Wow. Look at that.
That's just beautiful.

1127
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:11,198
Well, that's my brother.

1128
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,701
Just never afraid to put
a price tag on his feelings.

1129
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:17,996
Yeah. That's my sister.
Never understanding there's love,

1130
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,457
you can care and
want to show it in a big way,

1131
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:23,877
and you shouldn't be put down
and mocked, and made hurt feelings.

1132
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:27,923
When you love somebody,
you don't have to show it in a big way.

1133
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:31,718
So you were slumming when you
were making out with me in the kitchen?

1134
01:07:37,808 --> 01:07:40,561
It's a very, very affectionate family.

1135
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,813
- We show our love.
- Italians.

1136
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:44,773
We're just very warm.

1137
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:47,401
Red hot, even.

1138
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,821
All right, that's it.
Give me this. Get up.

1139
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,656
- Sit down!
- [Christine] Okay!

1140
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,449
Who wants a tour of the house?

1141
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:57,744
- What you're using are stairs.
- [squeaking]

1142
01:07:57,828 --> 01:08:00,080
We like these for going up.

1143
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:02,332
This is the bathroom.

1144
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,461
- What are you doing to me?
- What?

1145
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:10,048
- You're killing me.
- No, I'm just playing along, brother.

1146
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,676
I think Missy likes me.
She thinks I'm funny.

1147
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:15,470
This was little Drew's room.
Now, it's Brian's.

1148
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:16,638
Aw.

1149
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:19,391
Brian, don't be rude.
We have guests.

1150
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:22,853
He'd live in front of the screen
if we'd let him right, Tom?

1151
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:25,606
It's that insatiable appetite
for knowledge.

1152
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,232
Oh, shit!

1153
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:29,401
Brian, what have you done?!

1154
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:32,279
- Tom, I don't know what that is.
- I do.

1155
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:36,158
It's my wife shooting a "V"
for victory with her legs.

1156
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:38,660
It's been a while,
but that's what it looks like.

1157
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:41,663
- [Letitia] Honestly.
- That's my little girl.

1158
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:44,500
- Horace, get our coats.
- What's going on?

1159
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,668
You have no idea.
Missy, get your coat!

1160
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:48,837
- There's ham!
- [Missy] We're not going.

1161
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:50,964
- We'll stay.
- [Christine] Lighten up.

1162
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:54,051
It's just a picture.
I had pictures taken for fun.

1163
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:56,303
Where would you get
that stupid idea?!

1164
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:03,393
Coats! Someone say coats?
Get the coats. Gotta get coats.

1165
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,980
[Missy screams]

1166
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,649
[chuckles] Oh.

1167
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:16,740
Some things cannot be unseen.

1168
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:19,493
Brian? Brian?

1169
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,704
[Tom] Great.
Just great, Christine.

1170
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:30,254
I'll be at the Travel Lodge.

1171
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,715
[door slams]

1172
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:41,849
- Merry Christmas.
- Mom? Mom?

1173
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,893
- Oh, dear God.
- Wait a minute!

1174
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:46,812
There's more of Mom's buffet.

1175
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:50,274
If you think we're staying
after that display, think again.

1176
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,068
[Letitia] Trollops who
pose for dirty pictures,

1177
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,946
various incestuous overtones

1178
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,699
and old, unexplained men.

1179
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:01,577
This is without a doubt
the worst Christmas I've...

1180
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:04,204
Oh, shut up, Letitia!

1181
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,498
What?

1182
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:10,460
I'll tell you what. I've put up with
your high and mighty act for 25 years,

1183
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:11,920
but they don't have to.

1184
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:15,007
I don't remember you being superior
when you got knocked up

1185
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:18,635
by Skippy Altsheller
and then tricked me into marrying you.

1186
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:23,640
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry, Missy.

1187
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:28,020
Missy, darling, it's not true.
You were premature.

1188
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,522
Oh, come on, Letitia!

1189
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:34,985
Tell your mother thanks, Drew.
And Merry Christmas.

1190
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:38,822
Missy, we'll wait for you in the car.

1191
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:42,284
[grunts] You know, really.

1192
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:45,871
Yuletide's a bitch, ain't it?

1193
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,207
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up!

1194
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,085
Okay! Fiji.
Let's go to Fiji right now.

1195
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:54,796
You're right, Drew.
Just screw family.

1196
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:57,799
All we need is each other.
Just take me away.

1197
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:02,012
I'm sorry, Missy. I can't.

1198
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:06,099
Just go home, okay?
I'm sorry about all this.

1199
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,645
I'll spend Christmas alone.

1200
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:17,319
Oh, fine.

1201
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:18,946
[sobbing] Okay.

1202
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:22,783
Well, then...

1203
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,953
...the only thing
I have left to say to you

1204
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:28,121
is I am keeping this bracelet.

1205
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,962
I feel bad drinking liquor
you're gonna need.

1206
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:36,421
I better go.

1207
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,591
- Merry Christmas.
- All right.

1208
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,011
[Letitia] Missy, get in the car!

1209
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:44,888
My God!

1210
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:49,184
Have you lost your mind?
Did you just lose it in there?

1211
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,821
You know, I have to ask,

1212
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,990
just how bad is your real family

1213
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,285
that you would rather
spend your Christmas like this?

1214
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,632
There was no real family.

1215
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:24,803
What do you mean,
"there is no family"?

1216
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:26,430
You must've had a family.

1217
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:29,933
I mean, you must've had
a Doo-Dah, right?

1218
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:32,853
I had a friend whose grandfather,

1219
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,981
was called Doo-Dah.
I always liked that.

1220
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:41,987
My dad walked out on us on Christmas

1221
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,697
when I was four.

1222
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,200
It was basically
just me and my mom.

1223
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:52,331
She was a waitress
at the 24-hour coffee shop.

1224
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:56,919
She didn't have a lot of money,
so when Christmas came around,

1225
01:12:57,044 --> 01:13:01,548
it was an opportunity for her
to take a double shift. She did.

1226
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:06,094
And, you know,
my Christmases were,

1227
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:10,682
basically, I just kind of
sat around the house, you know?

1228
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,976
Then at night,
I'd walk down there,

1229
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:17,481
and Mom would always buy me
a grown-up stack of pancakes,

1230
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:21,068
and I would sit by myself
at the end of the counter

1231
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,736
and eat 'em.

1232
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:28,075
I did that for Christmas every year
until I turned 18.

1233
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,119
I haven't been able to walk
in a coffee shop since, though.

1234
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,996
Where's your mom now?

1235
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:36,250
Mom died when I was in college.

1236
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,545
I'm sorry.

1237
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:42,714
[Alicia] You know what?

1238
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:46,718
There's nothing that you can do
about those Christmases.

1239
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:49,346
But the one that you
can do something about,

1240
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:54,601
the one that's here and now, you just
spent that destroying my family.

1241
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:57,563
Alicia, just for the record,

1242
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,857
I didn't destroy your family.

1243
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:02,025
What are you talking about?

1244
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:04,611
Your parents are splitting up.

1245
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:07,114
It's obvious.
Brian knows it.

1246
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:11,160
That's why he spends all his time
in his room on his computer.

1247
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:14,496
You just didn't wanna see it.
I can understand that.

1248
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,833
I'm gonna go get my dad.

1249
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,459
Lock up when you leave.

1250
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:44,818
Well, all right.

1251
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,398
I forgive you.

1252
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,232
<i>No! No, Spirit! No!</i>

1253
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:51,403
<i>I will honor Christmas in my heart
and try to keep it all the year.</i>

1254
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:53,780
[knocking]

1255
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:56,116
No one's home!

1256
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,534
[knocking]

1257
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:59,119
[groans]

1258
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:02,498
What?

1259
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:03,999
[knocking]

1260
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:05,959
I hear you.

1261
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:11,298
- Are you gonna hit me?
- No.

1262
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:13,967
Are you gonna do something else
that still hurts?

1263
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:18,222
No. You gonna invite me in?

1264
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:20,599
You just stopped by
to hang out and catch up?

1265
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:23,936
- Reminisce?
- You owe me money.

1266
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,940
Right. The money.

1267
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:30,943
Okay, come on in.
I'll get my checkbook.

1268
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:48,085
You rented my place
when you could've been staying here?

1269
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:54,883
Well, I gotta admit, this is nice.

1270
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:56,301
Thanks.

1271
01:17:57,594 --> 01:18:00,514
You still splitting up with Christine?

1272
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:03,809
[Tom] Yeah. I guess.

1273
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:07,396
That would be a shame.

1274
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,064
[laughs]

1275
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,984
What are you laughing at?

1276
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,904
Nothing. It's just ironic.

1277
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,448
I paid all that money
to be part of your family.

1278
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:21,285
You're giving it away for nothing.

1279
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:24,496
[Drew] Look at this.

1280
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:27,374
That's the ticket to Doo-Dah's play.

1281
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:29,334
Yeah. I got mine too.

1282
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:43,849
[Tom] I'm not very good at apologizing.
I don't know if they're in there.

1283
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,934
[Drew] Come on.
What do you have to lose?

1284
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,690
[Doo-Dah] What do you want with me?

1285
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:53,567
[Marley] Much.

1286
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,235
[Doo-Dah] Who are you?

1287
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,905
In life, I was your partner...

1288
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:59,114
See anybody?

1289
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,116
That's Doo-Dah right there.

1290
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,076
What is the reason
for this visit?

1291
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,746
It is getting late
and I've been hard at work.

1292
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,164
He's not that bad.

1293
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:09,082
[Marley] To warn you, Ebenezer.

1294
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,251
He's not that good either.

1295
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:13,295
I'm gonna find Christine.

1296
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:16,298
[Marley] Learn from me.

1297
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:21,970
My spirit never walked
beyond our counting house.

1298
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:28,560
It never roved beyond
our money-changing hole.

1299
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:30,771
So I am condemned

1300
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:33,816
to wander through the world

1301
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,944
to see what I might have
shared on Earth,

1302
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:40,364
then turned to happiness.

1303
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:43,492
What are you doing here?

1304
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:46,078
[Doo-Dah] You were always
a good businessman.

1305
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:48,664
Doo-Dah's family, right?

1306
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,169
Brian. It's me, move over.

1307
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:57,631
No, man. Go find one
of the other empty seats.

1308
01:19:57,714 --> 01:19:59,883
Move over, Bri. Come on.

1309
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:08,475
- Where's your sister?
- [both] Shh.

1310
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,896
- Dear Brother!
- Fanny!

1311
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,607
Christine...

1312
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:20,863
If I were to leave,
I wouldn't even know where to go.

1313
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:23,532
Then why leave?

1314
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,244
That's what I'm sayin'.
I don't wanna leave.

1315
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,454
Then don't.

1316
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:35,377
- All right, I won't.
- Okay.

1317
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,882
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

1318
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:41,967
It's good.

1319
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:54,146
Bri, that girl...
She's kinda cute for you.

1320
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,814
- Talk to her.
- Stop it.

1321
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:59,026
- She's gonna hear.
- I saw you looking at her.

1322
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,903
- Stop.
- I can tell you like...

1323
01:21:01,028 --> 01:21:02,529
I can hear you.

1324
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:06,033
[chuckling]

1325
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:07,409
That's embarrassing.

1326
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:11,705
That's our grandfather.
This is Brian.

1327
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,082
There, Brian.
You're all set.

1328
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:20,881
I'm sorry.

1329
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,675
Is that your brother?

1330
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:27,638
Yeah.

1331
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:30,224
How do we travel exactly?

1332
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:33,852
Through the air. We fly!

1333
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:35,687
Not so hard!

1334
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,898
- Wedgie! Wedgie!
- [people laughing]

1335
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:00,671
[Drew] Alicia?

1336
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:03,507
- Hey.
- Hey.

1337
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:06,510
Were you in there
the whole time?

1338
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:09,304
No. I was just here
to pick up my mom.

1339
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:15,310
She's in there with your dad.

1340
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:18,605
They're kinda making out
in the third row.

1341
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,983
- Really?
- Yeah.

1342
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:24,361
- That's good.
- Look.

1343
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:28,323
I don't expect you to want
to talk to me or anything,

1344
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:33,245
so I'm not gonna bother you
and give you a hard time,

1345
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:36,832
camp outside your place
and stalk you and you know.

1346
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:38,959
But I do want to say that I'm sorry

1347
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:42,588
for what I put you through

1348
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,756
and say thank you.

1349
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,768
So who are you renting
for New Year's

1350
01:22:56,852 --> 01:23:00,189
'cause you know, us Valcos,
we book up kind of fast.

1351
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,191
[Drew] I see that.

1352
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:05,110
And I'd get on it if I were you.

1353
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:09,156
I'm lookin' for a family
with maybe a bearded,

1354
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:12,826
irascible dad
with a heart of gold.

1355
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:19,374
A brother who stays in his room
all the time by himself,

1356
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,754
and a sister who is...

1357
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:29,802
...wonderful and smart,

1358
01:23:30,803 --> 01:23:33,806
and really beautiful.

1359
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:38,685
Because I think that's
the kind of person that...

1360
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:43,690
...I could fall in love with.

1361
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:47,653
You know anybody like that?
I know it's tough.

1362
01:23:47,736 --> 01:23:48,862
Let me think.

1363
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:51,073
Not offhand,
but I'll get back to you.

1364
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,116
Let me know.

1365
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:56,203
<i>[ Judy Garland: "Have Yourself"
A Merry Little Christmas]</i>

1366
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,344
- [Horace] I hear you, dear.
- [Missy] Daddy, stop the car!

1367
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:14,555
Oh, my God!

1368
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:17,641
Oh, my God!

1369
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:19,810
He's kissing his sister.

1370
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:24,606
- [Letitia] That is open-mouth.
- 'Tis the season to be jolly.

1371
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:28,068
- [Letitia] Get us out of here!
- [Horace] They're tryin' to keep warm.

1372
01:24:28,152 --> 01:24:30,237
[Letitia] Come on!
