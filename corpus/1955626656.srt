1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,700
First things first
I'ma say all The words inside my head

2
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:17,724
I'm fired up and Tired of The way
That Things have been, oh-ooh

3
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:22,048
The way That Things have been, oh-ooh

4
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:26,973
Second Thing second
Don't you Tell me what you Think That I can be

5
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:33,098
I'm the one at The sail, I'm The master of my Sea, oh-ooh

6
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:37,123
The master of my Sea, oh-ooh

7
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:39,548
I was broken From a young age

8
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,573
Taking my sulking To The masses

9
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,398
Writing my poems for The Few

10
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:45,423
That looked at me Took To me, shook To me, feeling me

11
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:47,348
Singing From heart ache From The pain

12
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,273
Take up my message From The veins

13
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,298
Speaking my lesson From The brain

14
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:53,323
Seeing The beauty Through The...

15
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:55,448
Pain!

16
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,573
You made me a, you made me a Believer

17
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,298
Believer

18
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:03,023
Pain!

19
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:06,148
You break me down, you build me up, Believer

20
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:07,873
Believer

21
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,498
Pain...

22
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:14,123
I let The bullets Fly, oh let Them rain

23
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:17,148
My life, my love, my Drive, it Came From...

24
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:18,573
Pain!

25
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:21,598
You made me a, you made me a Believer

26
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,223
Believer

27
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:25,648
Third Things Third

28
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,673
Send a prayer To The ones up above

29
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:34,698
All The hate That you've heard
has Turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh

30
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:38,723
Your Spirit up above, oh-ooh

31
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:41,148
I was Choking in The Crowd

32
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,873
Living my brain up in The cloud

33
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,798
Falling like ashes To The ground

34
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,823
Hoping my Feelings, They would drown

35
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,048
But They never did, ever lived, ebbing and Flowing

36
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:50,073
Inhibited, limited

37
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:52,098
Till it broke open and it rained down

38
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:54,723
It rained down, like...

39
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:56,748
Pain!

40
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:59,873
You made me a, you made me a Believer

41
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:01,598
Believer

42
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,423
Pain!

43
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:07,448
You break me down, you build me up, Believer

44
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:09,273
Believer

45
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,898
Pain...

46
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,723
I let The bullets Fly, oh let Them rain

47
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:18,748
My life, my love, my Drive, it Came From...

48
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:19,773
Pain!

49
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:22,698
You made me a, you made me a Believer

00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:24,623
Believer

51
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,948
Last Things last

52
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,873
By The grace of The fire and The flames

53
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:35,898
You're The face of The future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

54
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:39,923
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

55
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,848
But They never did, ever lived, ebbing and Flowing

56
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:43,873
Inhibited, limited

57
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,698
Till it broke open and it rained down

58
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,723
It rained down, like...

59
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:54,948
I wanna Stop

60
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:58,573
We Can't

61
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:00,598
Pain!

62
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:03,923
You made me a, you made me a Believer

63
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,648
Believer

64
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:08,373

You break me down, you build me up, Believer

66
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:13,123
Believer

67
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,748
Pain...

68
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:19,473
I let The bullets Fly, oh let Them rain

69
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,498
My life, my love, my Drive, it Came From...

70
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:23,623
Pain!

71
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:26,848
You made me a, you made me a Believer
