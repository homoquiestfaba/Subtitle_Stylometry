[whimsical holiday music]

3
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,154
Since I was a kid, I
always felt awkward

4
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,530
and uneasy with myself.

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,494
Through learning to drive,
acne, doing laundry,

6
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,828
going to college,

7
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,333
each was unbearable
because I was incomplete.

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,378
I hadn't met Linda.

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,587
But now that I
have her in my life

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,840
I don't ever want to let her go.

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,301
I am so grateful for you.

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,386
I love you.

13
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,553
I love you too.

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,972
So cute.

15
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,099
Oh, and we can't
forget the reason

16
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,308
that we're all here tonight

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,519
and that is our
dear friend Maggie.

18
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,645
That's right.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,897
She brought us together.

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,108
Thank you, Maggie.

21
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,025
Thank you.

22
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,651
Cheers.

23
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,902
To Maggie.

26
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,916
Maggie.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,419
This is all because of you.

28
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,421
Oh I'm just so happy
that it worked out.

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,089
You're coming to
the wedding, right?

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,340
Yeah of course.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,216
Oh, Linda.

32
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,635
We need a picture.

33
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,053
Maggie, can you take it?

34
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,096
Yeah, definitely.

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,347
Okay, thank you.

36
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,433
All right, ready?

37
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,603
One, two, three.

38
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,938
[clicking]

39
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,440
Don't tell me,
another happy couple.

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,067
Yup, went to their
engagement party last night.

41
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,610
I wish they could get married
in time for Christmas.

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,363
I guess it would be a lot to
plan but it would be romantic.

43
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,032
Come on, this isn't a victory.

44
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,117
It has to be a lucky guess.
Don't say guess, all right?

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,120
You don't have this track
record by mere guesses.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,205
And yet I don't see
your photo up there.

47
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,249
That's because I'm too
busy helping other people

48
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,125
fall in love.

49
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,293
Sure.

50
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,961
How do you even know
this many people?

51
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,087
I moved around a lot.

52
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,922
Maggie?

53
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,091
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,385
So yeah I finished the edit

55
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,220
on the Wilmington
Heights manuscript.

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,430
Book three?

57
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,389
Uh huh, and Dale's
supposed to have

58
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,223
an outline to me for book four

59
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,433
by the end of the month.

60
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,769
Between you and me, I think
he's gonna need a break.

61
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,145
Don't we all?

62
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,229
I heard we're about
to sign a new author

63
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,440
and I'm leaning towards
assigning him to you.

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,443
Okay, yeah, fine. I think
I could take on one more.

65
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,612
Good, I'll have more details
as soon as it's finalized.

66
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,488
Great.

67
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,158
Ugh.

68
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,076
What?

69
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,077
Company Christmas party.

70
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,244
Oh, yeah, when is it?

71
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,162
The 20th.

72
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,497
I hate these.

73
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,581
Really?

74
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,750
I thought everybody
looked forward to them.

75
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,669
Trust me, compared to
all the other companies

76
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,338
I've worked for, this
one is top notch.

77
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,589
On the surface maybe,

78
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,508
but I hate having to get a date.

79
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,009
You don't have to bring a date.

80
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,636
People notice when I don't.

81
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,348
That awkward conversation is
they introduce their dates

82
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,475
and look around like
hey, where's your date?

83
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,727
Last year, I went
with my brother.

84
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,145
It wasn't any better.

85
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,357
[gasps] I could
find you somebody.

86
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,483
A setup?

87
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,567
That's worse.

88
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,611
No, really, it's kind of
become a hobby of mine.

89
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,071
I just paired up two friends,

90
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,239
they're getting married.

91
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,491
And then earlier this year
was Allie from reception

92
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,285
and then before that was
Stewart in the mail room.

93
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,538
And I also paired up a neighbor

94
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,665
with the daughter of the
VP of our nonfiction.

95
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,208
Really, Bruce's daughter?

96
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,209
Yeah.

97
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,086
She's super tricky
but I totally did it.

98
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,712
Oh, it's not important.

99
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
Excuse me, Amanda, hey.

100
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
A couple questions for
you on the expense report?

101
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,343
Which ones?

102
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,219
Here.

103
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,304
Well, this one.

104
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,561
Dinner to smooth things
over with Thea Greensboro.

105
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,812
You know what, go for it.

106
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,272
And this one?

107
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,482
Company Christmas gifts
for the fiction authors.

108
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,109
Wait, wait, you want
me to pair you up

109
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,235
for the Christmas party?

110
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,403
Yes.

111
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,446
And this one.

112
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,699
And please, whatever you
do, make it painless.

113
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,242
Oh yeah.

114
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,160
Yeah yeah, of course.

115
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,704
Oh, that one I don't remember.

116
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,498
Don't you have notes on
these, or can't you call?

117
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,084
That's fine, I'll
think of something.

118
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,043
Thanks.

119
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,426
[Maggie giggling]

120
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,261
Uh oh, what?

121
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,472
You're gonna hate it,
you're gonna hate it.

122
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,223
I'm bracing myself.

123
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,600
Amanda wants me
to find her a date

124
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,101
for the Christmas party.

125
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,853
[chuckling]

126
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,271
Haven't you met your
quota for the year?

127
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,440
No, you can't have too
much of a good thing.

128
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,649
Yes you can.

129
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,276
Shh.

130
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,445
You think you can find her
a soulmate by Christmas?

131
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,696
Maybe.

132
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,864
You wanna bet on it?

133
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,283
No, no, no.

134
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,577
And listen, I don't
need your negative vibes

135
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,787
on this one, okay?

136
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,582
[whimsical Christmas music]

137
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,547
Oh, I have no idea what to
get mom and dad this year.

138
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,467
Dad says slippers, no
books, and good children.

139
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,761
He says that every year, Nicole.

140
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,721
Now when is he gonna
realize we're adults?

141
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,972
Never.

142
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:07,974
Although Andrew and I are
hanging on to that for our kids.

143
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,227
Oh yeah, what is it they want?

144
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,646
Sawyer wants board
games and Tammy wants

145
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,315
superhero action figures.

146
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,483
Any hints for mom?

147
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,568
She says she wants
a massage table.

148
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,654
Oh yeah, well, she'll
never use that.

149
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,822
I'm gonna claim that one then.

150
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,823
I don't care if
she doesn't use it

151
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,825
as long as I have
something from her list.

152
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,451
Great, so you're gonna
make me be creative?

153
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,619
Yup, you're good at it.

154
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,789
Right.

155
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,418
Okay so help me brainstorm.

156
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,462
I just gave you a
whole bunch of ideas.

157
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,339
No, no , no, I'm not
talking about presents.

158
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,674
I'm talking about men.

159
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,592
I'm trying to find
a date for my boss

160
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,177
for the Christmas party.

161
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,595
I don't know.

162
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,681
Come on, cough up all
the friends that we know.

163
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,474
I'll even consider
acquaintances.

164
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,977
Toby.

165
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,520
Toby?

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,357
Oh, the dental hygienist
from Andrew's office?

167
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,651
Yeah, Andrew thinks
he's a good worker.

168
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,527
Hmmm.

169
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,821
Well I guess I was thinking

170
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,783
somebody more
distinguished and settled.

171
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,869
You must be kissing
up to your boss.

172
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,453
No, it's not that at all.

173
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,664
She's just, she's a really
good person, all right?

174
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,666
The boss part, that's
not even a factor.

175
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,377
Come on, who do we know?

176
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,462
Oh, Marvin.

177
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,965
He owns a cafe
around the corner.

178
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh yeah, you love that place.

179
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,885
Yeah.

180
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,386
Do you know him that well?

181
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,221
Oh he is super sweet.

182
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,807
He's divorced but he's
a really hard worker.

183
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,767
Do you realize you always fixate

184
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,728
on setting other people
up but never yourself?

185
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,563
Well, not since Jaxson.

186
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,731
Hey, don't, no, don't.

187
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,859
Don't say his name, all right?

188
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,943
[phone beeping]

189
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,445
Oh wait, you know what?

190
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,487
I think I gotta go.

191
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,449
Hey, you wanna go in
on something for Dad?

192
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,617
Yes, I do.

193
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,701
Can you just tell me what
you end up getting him?

194
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,493
Okay.

195
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,578
Thank you.

196
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,495
See ya.

197
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,543
Oh hey, did you hear?

198
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,919
Hmm?

199
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,254
Christmas book I designed
is flying off the shelf,

200
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,255
the e‐book too.

201
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,424
And it's all because
of your cover design,

202
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,051
it has nothing to do with
what the author wrote?

203
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,594
I'm just saying.
Uh huh.

204
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,304
I feel a sense of pride here.

205
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,847
Well, that is great.

206
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,557
Oh, Amanda's looking for you.

207
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,268
Probably so you two can
plan her romantic future.

208
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,771
Okay.

209
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,026
I think you'll be
happy with the editor.

210
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,611
Here she is.

211
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,614
Maggie, I'd like to introduce
you to Jaxson Jones,

212
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,615
I'm sure you've heard of him.

213
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,991
Hi.

214
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,534
Hi.

215
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,911
Jackson's been looking
for a change in publisher

216
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,538
and we are delighted
he's chosen us.

217
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,873
You'll be his editor.

218
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,459
Oh that's great news.

219
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,710
Yes it is.

220
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,379
It's nice to meet you.

221
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,465
Yeah it's nice to meet you too.

222
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
I've heard so much about you.

223
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,262
So?

224
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,641
Oh.

225
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,892
I look forward to
hearing thoughts

226
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,519
about your next book.

227
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,020
I have time right now.

228
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,563
Right now?

229
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,481
Okay, sure.

230
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,026
All right, yeah, I'll go see

231
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,112
if the conference
room is available.

232
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:07,946
Great.

233
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,616
Great.

234
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,618
This is great.

235
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,494
Great.

236
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,956
Ooh.

237
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,458
What's wrong?

238
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,668
Nothing, nothing.

239
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,669
Wow, I almost believe you.

240
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,670
Jaxson Jones.

241
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,756
I thought that was him!

242
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,675
You can never tell because
the book jacket photo

243
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,677
is always too glammed
up to be recognizable

244
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,512
or it's in black and white.

245
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,723
Well, he's my new
author so there's that.

246
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,433
Oh, well lucky you.

247
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,642
Not really.

248
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,518
Why?

249
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,853
'Cause I almost married him.

250
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,694
[knocking]

251
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,821
Mr. Jones, have a seat.

252
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,828
So.

253
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,664
It's been a long time.

254
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,791
It's good to see you.

255
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,876
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,795
You look good.

257
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,339
Thanks.

258
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,051
How you been?

259
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,011
How about we just
talk about you?

260
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,722
All right, what is it that
you're wanting to do next?

261
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,728
Well, I'm kind of
tired of the mysteries

262
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,730
and thrillers I've been writing.

263
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,524
So I wanna dabble in
some other genres.

264
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,567
Hmm, that's risky.

265
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
Well it doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop writing

266
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,779
my bread and butter.

267
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,490
But I think I've earned the
right to do what I want.

268
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,575
All right, yeah no,

269
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,910
I'm gonna have to
run that by Amanda

270
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,870
and maybe a couple others.

271
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,206
Why is that?

272
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,583
Oh you know, I
don't know the terms

273
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,752
of your contract
but I can imagine

274
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,797
it's a pretty lucrative one
here at Red Lake Publishing.

275
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,423
It's fair.

276
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,424
I just think that they're
gonna want to, you know,

277
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,009
make sure that they
recoup whatever it is

278
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,552
that they're paying you.

279
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,597
And writing in a different
genre would jeopardize that?

280
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,015
Oh, it's a precaution.

281
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,393
Is that why you were shopping
around for other publishers?

282
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,188
What?

283
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,107
Oh, you know, I'm just asking.

284
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,067
Did they not like the
whole new genre thing?

285
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,529
No, that's, that's
not why I left.

286
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,535
Could you just stop
note taking for a sec?

287
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,497
It's a meeting, it's my job.

288
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,540
Yeah but you don't,

289
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,464
why don't I collect my
thoughts a bit more?

290
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,091
Is there a way I can reach you?

291
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:33,925
Oh yeah.

292
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,512
There you go.

293
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,555
Thank you.
Mhmm.

294
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,266
My info.

295
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,433
Great.

296
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,146
Well it was good to see you.

297
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:46,980
Yeah.

298
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,868
You know, I was wondering
what it would be like

299
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,452
if we ran into each other again.

300
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,956
And I have to admit,
it's pretty much

301
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,166
as awkward as I imagined.

302
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,503
Yeah, so now that we've
gotten that out of the way,

303
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,672
I think it's best if we
just get back to work.

304
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,091
Sounds good.

305
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,560
[sighs]

306
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,645
He seems nice, he's
your type, right?

307
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,771
No, no.

308
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,191
So what happened with you guys?

309
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,485
Nothing.

310
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,821
I guess not.

311
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,823
When were you engaged?

312
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,870
It was my second
year of college.

313
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,205
Was he a jerk or something?

314
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,623
It's complicated.

315
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,293
So why didn't you marry him?

316
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,170
There were so many obstacles.

317
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,048
Okay, like what?

318
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,593
For starters I got the
scholarship to Oxford

319
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,011
and I really wanted to go for it

320
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,639
and he got upset
and so we broke up

321
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,266
and I mean, you know.

322
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,852
Yeah, yeah, it sounds like
it wasn't meant to be.

323
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,939
And then was it my parents?

324
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,024
No, actually, my whole family,

325
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,652
they had issues
with his aspirations

326
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,320
to become an author.

327
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,072
That's funny, considering.

328
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:19,989
Mhmm.

329
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,699
Yeah so there was the age thing,

330
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,076
and there's the
scholarship thing.

331
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,913
We were just too
young to be in love.

332
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,748
Like Romeo and Juliet?

333
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,083
Or Bella and Edward.

334
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,000
Mhmm.

335
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,876
Wesley and Buttercup.

336
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,086
Wait.

337
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,172
Except for the fact that
all those people you listed

338
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,548
were actually in love.

339
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,884
Like Samson and Delilah.

340
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,718
Bingo.

341
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,264
[Dean laughing]

342
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,267
Maggie.

343
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,603
What are you doing here?

344
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,648
I'm waiting for you.

345
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,565
Why?

346
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,776
Well, I want to talk about,

347
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,697
listen, if we're gonna
be working together,

348
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,115
it can't be like that.

349
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,367
I don't know what you mean.

350
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,743
Yes you do.

351
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,911
But we're not
handling this right

352
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,248
and if we don't address
it, it's gonna get worse.

353
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,125
Look, Mr. Jones, I
really appreciate you‐‐

354
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,334
That.

355
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,252
Mr. Jones?

356
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,045
Come on.

357
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,968
Jaxson, I can't just pretend
that this isn't weird.

358
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,095
Fine, let's just
admit that it's weird.

359
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,223
I don't know how
that's any better.

360
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,809
Well, we're grown up now, right?

361
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,105
We can say the past is in the
past and we'll move forward.

362
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,983
I think that's a lot
easier said than done.

363
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,736
I think we're strong
enough to try.

364
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,737
So what do you say?

365
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,780

00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,265
Yes, no, thanks for
your time, really.

550
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,809
It was awesome.

551
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,310
Hopefully we do this again.

552
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,273
No, I'll just.

553
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,652
All right.

554
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,569
Thank you.
Thanks.

555
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,654
Okay.
Take care.

556
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,491
Right, so how did it go?

557
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,534
He's nice.

558
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,910
Okay, look, that was my fault.

559
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,620
I didn't really think
through Alan as an option

560
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,163
or if you liked
a certain height.

561
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,249
We were in two different
atmospheric levels.

562
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,500
Look, don't worry
about it, all right?

563
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,668
Look, Steven is next.

564
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,919
He's super nice.

565
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,879
He loves books, he
reads all the time.

566
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,881
You guys are gonna have
a lot to talk about.

567
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,133
[sighs] Fine.

568
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,346
I've been looking
forward to this.

569
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,597
Really?

570
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,516
Yeah, I devour books.

571
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,310
And Maggie had a lot of great
things to say about you.

572
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,854
Oh, thank you.

573
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,690
She says you're an avid reader.

574
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,650
That's putting it mildly.

575
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,193
Any favorites?

576
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,612
Well, my favorites,
I'm sorry to admit

577
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,531
are actually from
another publisher

578
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,408
but I'm sure you've
heard about them.

579
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,827
Half‐Blood Fiend, Galaxy Feud,

580
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,205
Rise of the Orcs, and
Into the Black of Space.

581
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,915
Science fiction.

582
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,250
And fantasy.

583
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,167
Oh.

584
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,340
Maggie?

585
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,552
Jaxson.

586
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,846
What are you doing here?
I'm supervising, I guess.

587
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,473
Amanda's meeting somebody

588
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,225
so I'm just making
sure it's all okay.

589
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,353
And does she know you're
here watching her?

590
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,521
Yeah.

591
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,732
I'm not crazy.

592
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,816
I'm actually, I'm
setting her up.

593
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,860
It's kind of this hobby of mine.

594
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,403
Huh, that's new.

595
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,906
At least in the last 15 years.

596
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,574
Yeah I like pairing up friends

597
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,409
that I think will get along.

598
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,660
Yeah it's kind of fun.

599
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,245
Any of them work out?

600
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,874
Yeah, actually six
couples are married.

601
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,250
Really?

602
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,544
Yeah. A few of them
are still dating, so.

603
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,420
Any breakups?

604
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,339
One or two.

605
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,718
So how are they doing?

606
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,595
So Maggie tells me
that you're over

607
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,888
the whole fiction department.

608
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,598
Any chance that your
company might be getting

609
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,808
into the sci‐fi
and fantasy room?

610
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,894
It's not our specialty.

611
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,438
We do have a few titles
that have an element

612
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,606
of science fiction.

613
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:05,736
But nothing quite as
concentrated as what you like.

614
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,450
You know what, I wanted to
show you some of the figures

615
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,369
from the genre's readership.

616
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,703
We're a devout group.

617
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,664
And I mean just look at
what Rise of the Orcs

618
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,581
did in sales.

619
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,917
I think they're doing okay.

620
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:22,920
Uh‐oh.

621
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,798
That doesn't look good.

622
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,466
Yeah it doesn't look promising.

623
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,385
Yeah, I should go save her.

624
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,552
Better luck next time.

625
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,303
Thank you.

626
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,266
It was good to see you.
You too.

627
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,984
Maybe we should get
in line and tell Santa

628
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,735
I need a date for Christmas.

629
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,112
Okay look, I think
if you just looked

630
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,489
at some of these guys that you
crossed out without meeting,

631
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,825
No offense, but, how
did any of your friends

632
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,784
ever get together?

633
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,662
Sometimes it's a little bit of a

634
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,706
you know, learning curve.

635
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh hey, here's Marvin.

636
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,382
Okay, so he owns the cafe
around the corner from work.

637
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,800
He's super nice.

638
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,885
Maybe, start with the bad

639
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,971
and then I can be
pleasantly surprised.

640
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,144
So Maggie tells me
that you work together.

641
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,645
Yeah.

642
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,106
And how did the two of
you know each other?

643
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:28,485
Oh well, she just kept
coming into the cafe

644
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,613
and well over time,
we started talking.

645
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,491
She's a good soul.

646
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,368
Yeah.

647
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,539
She's bolder than I am.

648
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,543
I'm not one to talk
easily with strangers.

649
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,505
Ah, that's those childhood
warnings from your mom.

650
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,506
Right.

651
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,841
Stranger danger!

652
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,053
It's always been hard for me

653
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,930
to strike up a conversation
with someone I don't know.

654
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,724
Well I think you're
doing just fine.

655
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,726
Yeah.

656
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,732
Oh.

657
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,025
They're exchanging numbers.

658
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:13,906
This is good.

659
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,408
It's really good.

660
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:22,915
Hey.

661
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,257
So you set up a second date?

662
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,926
Yes.

663
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,802
When?

664
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,928
Thursday.

665
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,097
Okay, that's excellent.

666
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,056
Isn't he nice?

667
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,432
He's so nice.

668
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,809
Okay, don't get too crazy.

669
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,312
Yes, Marvin is
nice, and handsome.

670
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,107
And I can respect him, unlike,

671
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,525
Steven, I know, I know.

672
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,902
Okay so what can I do to help?

673
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:55,322
Marvin suggested a couple
of options for dinner.

674
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,785
Italian, a boutique
Chinese place, or,

675
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,412
What?

676
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,873
Or he offered to make
me dinner at his cafe.

677
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,083
Is that weird?

678
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,876
No, it's not weird.

679
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,253
That's romantic.

680
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,215
None of those iffy waiters in
loud, overcrowded restaurants.

681
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,466
It's perfect, what time?

682
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,801
8:30.

683
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,511
Right, so the cafe
closes at eight

684
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,847
so it'll just be the two of you.

685
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,306
He'll be cooking.

686
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,017
Oh, pick that one.

687
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,477
What if it gets awkward?

688
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,104
Oh it won't, no.

689
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,147
Marvin's really good at
making people feel welcome

690
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,024
and cared for.

691
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,152
Okay, if you're sure.

692
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,531
Totally sure.

693
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,537
Posters for Marguerite
Van Kelly's book signing

694
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,538
are in the conference room.

695
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,164
Okay, yeah great,

696
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,457
I'll pick them up in the
morning before the event.

697
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,877
[knocking]

698
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,379
You want me to stick around?

699
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,506
I can wait to go to lunch.
No, I'm fine, thanks.

700
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,049
Cool.

701
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,884
Hey.
Hey.

702
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,012
I wasn't expecting you.

703
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,222
Well, I finished the
preliminary outline

704
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,473
for my Christmas book.

705
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,225
Ready for your feedback.

706
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,561
Oh well, you could
have emailed it.

707
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah, I guess I could have.

708
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,523
Okay great yeah, I'll
take a look at it.

709
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,357
Sure.

710
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,987
Hey do you wanna get
out for a little bit?

711
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,947
I got a lot of work.
You can take a break.

712
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,865
There's something
I want to check out

713
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,616
for the Christmas book.

714
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,034
It's kind of like research.

715
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,619
Yeah, I don't,

716
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,871
Come on, don't you
wanna make sure it works

717
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,538
for the book?

718
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,166
Okay.

719
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,043
Yeah I guess I can fit it in.

720
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,002
Great.

721
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,505
[light music]

722
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,301
So a sleigh ride?

723
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,928
You really had to research this?

724
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,054
Well, you ever been on one?

725
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,513
Well a hay ride.

726
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,389
That counts, right?

727
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,724
No it does not.

728
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,517
I'm all about authenticity.

729
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,061
Oh right.

730
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,229
And all of your novels about
world domination schemes

731
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,397
really highlights that.

732
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,194
You never rode one
of these in New York?

733
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,612
Didn't have much need
for a sleigh ride

734
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,405
in any of my action novels.

735
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,032
Oh.

736
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,117
So why'd you decide to
leave the Big Apple?

737
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,078
I got tired of it.

738
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,246
And when was that?

739
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,374
About two months ago.

740
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,127
So you decided to
move back home.

741
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,296
I'm surprised you
decided to move home.

742
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,966
Work's taken me a
bunch of places, so,

743
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,593
Yeah, Junior Copy
Editor at the Herald,

744
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,429
writer and editor at
that magazine company,

745
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,181
Health Magazine?

746
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,977
The Lifestyle Magazine, sadly.

747
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,269
Right.
Mhmm.

748
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,231
What happened next?

749
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,734
There was the Technical Editor

750
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,444
at that textbook publisher

751
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:44,366
and then well there was
just a few in between there.

752
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,283
Oh, riveting.

753
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,286
Took a while jumping around.

754
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,123
Maybe I was trying to
flesh out my resume.

755
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:51,999
Sure you were.

756
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,710
Okay, and your career,

757
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,295
really, the book that
makes your career,

758
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,630
A Tiger's Burden?

759
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,134
Yes, please, tease
me about that.

760
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,012
Okay, I will.
I'm strangely proud of it.

761
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,596
Wait, does that
mean you read it?

762
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,182
Oh.
Yeah.

763
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,102
[laughing]

764
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:12,978
Yes, I did.

765
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,606
Please tell me you've read some

766
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,692
of my better stuff since then.

767
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,318
What, you've had better stuff?

768
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,280
I walked into that one.
No.

769
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,114
You did.

770
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,161
So Nicole's married.

771
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,704
Noticed the ring.

772
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,999
Yeah actually, she
has two kids too.

773
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,208
Wow.

774
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,501
That sounds great.

775
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,335
Yeah.

776
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,338
I'm really sorry
about the other day.

777
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,051
She still hates me.

778
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,594
No, I mean, it's not that she,

779
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,554
she doesn't hate you.

780
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,180
She just,

781
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,349
yeah she hates you. [laughing]

782
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,518
She hates you, I'm sorry.

783
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,481
I can never figure out what
I did to get on her bad side.

784
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,818
And you?

785
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,696
What about, you know,
your relationships?

786
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,201
A few, but, nothing special.

787
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,661
You?

788
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,371
I've been really busy with work

789
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,207
so there's that, you know.

790
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,543
Yeah, I find it kind of hard

791
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,337
to really get to know
anyone these days,

792
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,048
what with the author persona.

793
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,175
It's all anybody sees.

794
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,510
Oh yeah, it's the price of fame.

795
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,427
I guess so.

796
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,595
I'm so sad.

797
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,056
[laughing]

798
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,392
But it is nice to talk to
someone who knew me before.

799
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:36,728
Yeah.

800
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,064
Yeah.

801
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,234
Giddup!

802
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,406
Hi.

803
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,699
There you go.

804
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,409
Thank you.

805
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,410
Hey.

806
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,245
Hey.

807
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:58,375
So Marvin's making a raspberry
bread pudding Thursday.

808
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,294
Oh, I don't think I've ever
had that in his cafe before.

809
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,838
Well he asked me my
favorite dessert,

810
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,590
my favorite fruit, and voila.

811
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,424
Hmm.

812
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,263
He's doing a lot to prepare.

813
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,722
And?

814
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,142
It seems like he
wants to impress me.

815
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,102
Well that's a good
thing, isn't it?

816
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,813
I don't want him to be
disappointed though.

817
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,273
In you?

818
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,566
No, never, don't
worry about that.

819
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,567
Or if it doesn't work out,

820
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,736
I don't want this all
to be a waste of time.

821
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,821
Well why would it be?

822
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,240
I don't know.

823
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,326
Maybe I'm just nervous.

824
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,620
Yeah, well don't be, all right?

825
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,581
Just enjoy it.

826
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:38,790
Dating can be risky

827
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,126
but it can also be
kind of fun too.

828
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,628
Oh, Marguerite needs me.

829
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,839
Okay, I'm gonna head
back to the office.

830
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,507
Okay, Amanda, look,

831
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,301
you deserve to find
somebody that you love.

832
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,261
Just give Marvin a chance.

833
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,305
Okay.

834
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,181
Good.

835
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,146
[light music]

836
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,678
[sentimental music]

837
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,528
[chimes ringing]

838
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,529
Hello.

839
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,739
Hi.

840
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,990
I hope you're hungry.

841
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,743
Oh, I hope you can
save the leftovers.

842
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,913
Please make yourself
comfortable.

843
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,581
Oh, you look nice.

844
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,540
Thank you.

845
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,669
What can I get for you? How
can I get you started here?

846
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,045
Anything.

847
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,505
It all looks good.

848
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,547
Yeah.

849
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,674
Favorite bread.

850
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,884
Asiago cheese, rye, sourdough?

851
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,678
Sourdough.
Sourdough.

852
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,595
All righty.

853
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,266
What is that?

854
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,894
That is a special
house blend of mayo.

855
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,020
Secret recipe?

856
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,939
Of course, yeah, yeah.

857
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,775
Okay meat, and cheese.

858
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,778
Turkey and that one.

859
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,780
That one, good choice.

860
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,698
Thank you.

861
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,410
There we go.

862
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,244
Yeah.

863
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,915
So how long have
you had your cafe?

864
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,712
Oh, seven years.

865
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,797
I don't normally make sandwiches

866
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,632
but if they all look like that,

867
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,259
You'd eat them every night.

868
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,927
Oh, soup?

869
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,761
Yes.

870
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,599
Do you ever get tired of it?

871
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,475
Of food?

872
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,978
And cooking.
Let me ask you this.

873
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,605
If you get a few
minutes to yourself,

874
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,898
do you still like to read?

875
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,984
Yes.
Uh huh, well, same here.

876
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,653
You know back when I
first opened the place,

877
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,905
it was actually
really stressful.

878
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,658
It took over almost
everything else in my life.

879
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,952
Maggie mentioned
you were married.

880
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,786
Oh.

881
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,124
Did that happen before the cafe?

882
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:31,296
Actually, I got a little
too caught up in the cafe

883
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,673
and things unraveled.

884
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,008
I'm sorry.

885
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,344
Well, I can see now that
the cafe is something

886
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,803
that I can enjoy.

887
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,929
I love to cook

888
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,307
and meet the people
that come here.

889
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,518
You have it all figured out.

890
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,438
Ah, well, it's not
that I haven't made

891
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,773
my share of mistakes,

892
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:54,486
but yeah I mean,
there's a balance now.

893
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,820
I look forward to it all.

894
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,530
That sounds nice

895
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,659
and free of regret.

896
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,951
Free?

897
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,870
I wish, no.

898
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,666
But you know, you learn
from regrets, right?

899
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,960
You gonna try that soup?

900
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,506
Good?

901
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,841
Delicious.

902
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,927
Well, load up, you
need the energy.

903
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,596
Gonna have you help me
make the dessert later.

904
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,724
Oh, I'm not a good cook.

905
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,434
Oh that's okay, I am.

906
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,061
And I'll be right
there to help you.

907
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,694
[upbeat Christmas music]

908
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
Hey.

909
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,822
Hey.

910
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,906
So how was your date?

911
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,908
It was good.

912
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,701
Really?

913
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,703
Yes, are you surprised?

914
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,912
I'm delighted.

915
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,872
I want you to tell
me all about it.

916
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,999
Marvin is a great cook,

917
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:54,504
and reassuring and someone
I feel I can trust.

918
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,755
Yeah, good.

919
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,383
So do you have another date
before the Christmas party, or,

920
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,592
No.

921
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,511
Are you just gonna go to
the Christmas party then or?

922
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:05,682
You were right about him
being so nice and thoughtful.

923
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:06,599
He's a great friend.

924
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,603
But I can't see him as
anything more than that.

925
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,481
Are you sure?

926
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,442
I mean it really was just
the first date, right?

927
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,737
Some of the best relationships
are built on friendship.

928
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,615
Isn't that a line from one
of our self‐help books?

929
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,908
Yeah but it's true.

930
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,077
I guess.

931
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,581
Still, I was honest with him.

932
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,749
I didn't wanna hurt him

933
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,959
and I didn't wanna
waste his time.

934
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,461
How did he take it?

935
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,504
Exactly as I thought he would.

936
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,424
Completely understanding
and supportive.

937
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,593
Well I'm sorry that
it didn't work out.

938
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,053
No, don't worry about it.

939
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,807
If nothing else, it's
flattering that you thought

940
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,101
I could match up with
someone as good as he is.

941
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,105
It's like Amanda's giving up
on the idea of being set up.

942
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,524
That's kind of
strange when she had

943
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,777
a good date with Marvin?

944
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,736
Yeah.

945
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,904
That's plenty of icing, honey.

946
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,948
Maybe it's an attraction thing.

947
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,659
It's no big deal,
just try again.

948
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,952
Well I could, but,

949
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,580
it's like her heart's
not in it anymore.

950
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,790
Do you think she's disappointed

951
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,125
with the suggestions I made,
that they didn't pan out?

952
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,795
Maybe she just
wants a simple date.

953
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,838
I mean you always
promise everlasting love.

954
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,006
Think of the pressure.

955
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,800
She goes into it
looking at long term

956
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,968
but barely knows the
guy on the surface.

957
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,971
That's surprisingly insightful.

958
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,598
Surprisingly?

959
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:31,851
Although, if she did
just want a date,

960
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,144
then she would have
gone with Marvin.

961
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,647
I mean she said that she liked
him, just not romantically.

962
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,191
So maybe she does want
someone she can truly love.

963
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,653
Okay, so then do I keep looking
for a date for her or not?

964
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,112
Ask her.

965
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,199
Although I'm more curious
if you are taking a date.

966
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,951
I haven't even
thought about that.

967
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,874
Wow, what is this place?

968
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,544
We're having the Christmas
party here this year.

969
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,671
There are some aspects
about the party

970
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,757
that we need help with,
so I nominated you

971
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,758
to be on the party committee.

972
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,176
Hey, what?

973
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,344
Sorry.

974
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,929
Yeah, lucky me.

975
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,305
You know how important it is.

976
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,224
It's not about employee morale.

977
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,725
Mhmm.

978
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,186
It's not just about
employee morale.

979
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,981
It's a chance for us to
wine and dine our authors

980
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,232
and keep them happy.

981
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,859
Let me show you guys around.

982
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,739
Food will be setup over here.

983
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,576
We have the catering arranged,

984
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,744
but there are some
holes that we need

985
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,038
the committee to handle.

986
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,916
There's decorating
the day of the party,

987
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,878
handling the coat
check which will be

988
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,629
by the entrance of course,

989
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,716
and handling the
toy drive donations.

990
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,259
Oh there's a toy drive?

991
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,093
Yeah, every year.

992
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,305
Now Tori, you don't
mind decorating

993
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,765
so you and I can handle that.

994
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,560
Good, anyone else
wanna help out there?

995
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,895
Great.

996
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,064
You know what, I'll go ahead
and take the toy drive.

997
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,941
Perfect, thanks.

998
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,903
Jim, that leaves you to
handle the coat check.

999
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,907
Now there are some decorations
that need to be prepared

1000
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,033
before the party.

1001
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,242
Wait, I'm sorry, when
you say prepared,

1002
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,744
what exactly do you mean?

1003
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,120
Made?

1004
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,079
Made?

1005
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,749
Yeah, sorry.

1006
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,918
I'll let you all know
what that entails.

1007
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,421
So what job are you gonna have

1008
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,797
on the party committee?

1009
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,967
Well the perk and
curse of being a VP

1010
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,595
is that I have to
entertain the authors.

1011
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,430
Sorry to spring the
committee thing on you

1012
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,932
but I know you're reliable.

1013
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,850
No it's fine, it's probably
good to have a purpose

1014
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,311
at the party so I don't have
to stand around and look busy.

1015
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,729
That's the spirit.

1016
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,606
Oh, oh, speaking of.

1017
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,775
I have been rethinking
the guys that I know

1018
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,984
for your date.

1019
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,320
And I think that‐‐
Oh, that.

1020
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,114
Maybe let me look over
your list again, okay?

1021
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,117
Okay, yeah, sure.

1022
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,249
Hey.
Here's some messages.

1023
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,125
Thank you.

1024
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,171
What did you get
roped into doing?

1025
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,298
Oh, the toy donation table.

1026
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,758
Ooh.

1027
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,344
Yeah, the secret is
to act really stressed
this time of year

1028
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,137
and then you don't get picked
to be on the committee.

1029
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,682
It's all work anyway
though, right?

1030
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,809
Yeah well next year have
at least one meltdown.

1031
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,769
November's a
logical time for it.

1032
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,813
[laughing] That's a good tip.

1033
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,772
Hey.

1034
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,984
Still trying to pair up Amanda?

1035
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:26,859
Yeah.

1036
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,319
What about Chester?

1037
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,946
Chester?

1038
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,656
Well I'm just saying, I mean.

1039
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,033
I think there could
be something there.

1040
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,868
He's an accountant.

1041
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,286
So he's incapable of love?

1042
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,746
No, I just,

1043
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,707
Okay, thanks.

1044
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,667
I don't think they
make a good match.

1045
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:45,378
All right.

1046
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,344
This is becoming a habit.

1047
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,847
Ah, I was in the neighborhood
again. How was your day?

1048
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,349
I survived.

1049
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,893
Sounds like you
could use a break.

1050
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,854
I have just the thing in mind.

1051
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,688
You do?

1052
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,231
Mhmm.

1053
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,358
Okay.

1054
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,737
Remember this place?

1055
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,822
I tripped and
gashed my knee here.

1056
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,242
I did try to stop your fall.
No, if I remember correctly

1057
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,202
you were the one
that caused the fall.

1058
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,830
Come on.

1059
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,207
No, it's been like,

1060
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,252
it had to have been at least
10 years since I skated last.

1061
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,046
Eh, you'll pick it up.

1062
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,422
Come on.

1063
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,216
That's what you said last time.

1064
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,054
[scraping]

1065
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:36,929
Okay.

1066
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,890
Ooh!

1067
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,891
You gotta trust yourself.

1068
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,477
Oh I trust myself, I
just don't trust my feet

1069
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,395
in these skates.

1070
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,396
Come on.

1071
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,025
I'm good.

1072
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,236
Relax, I will not
let you fall again.

1073
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,076
Okay.

1074
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,369
That's it.

1075
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,455
That's good.

1076
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,915
Yeah?
Just loosen up.

1077
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,500
Okay, I'm loose, I'm
loose, totally loose.

1078
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,460
So, question for you.

1079
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,297
Do you think back then
that I'd ever end up here?

1080
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,256
Back then?

1081
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,010
I thought we agreed that
we'd leave the past alone?

1082
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,179
Yeah, but humor me. I
know it's one thing to say

1083
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,473
you wanna be an author
when you grow up.

1084
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:21,432
Careful, don't lock your knees.

1085
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,475
Oh, right, okay.

1086
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,896
Yeah, I knew you'd make it.

1087
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,980
You did?

1088
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,441
Yeah but I believed
a lot back then.

1089
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:32,777
All right.

1090
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,779
All right, fair enough.

1091
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,076
I always admired that you knew

1092
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,285
what you wanted to do.

1093
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,330
I had no idea what
I was gonna be.

1094
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,790
I just knew what I was good at.

1095
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,126
Grammar, reading , writing.

1096
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:48,960
Yeah.

1097
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,296
Question is, are you happy?

1098
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,135
In work?

1099
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:00,930
Mostly.

1100
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,100
It's just that it's,

1101
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,395
you know it's become
more work lately.

1102
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,437
So not happy.

1103
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,356
No I didn't say that.

1104
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,149
So that's why you
keep moving around

1105
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,525
from job to job.

1106
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,818
Maybe.

1107
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,988
How about you?

1108
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,489
Are you happy?

1109
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,866
Sure.

1110
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:22,160
I love writing,
I have some fame,

1111
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,370
a little fortune.

1112
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,541
So modest.

1113
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,585
So why Red Lake Publishing?

1114
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,961
I mean the fortune part,

1115
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,337
I can't imagine
that we can compete

1116
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,505
with what you're used to.

1117
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,926
Yeah, but money's not
everything, right?

1118
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,844
Come on, why?

1119
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,682
It just stopped being fun.

1120
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,895
It got to be too much with
the deadlines, the machine.

1121
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,397
Everything got bigger,
more time‐consuming,

1122
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,524
that's just not where
I want to be anymore.

1123
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,484
Then why Red Lake?

1124
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,528
Well they're not the
only ones I met with.

1125
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,363
I spent several months meeting
with various publishers,

1126
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,032
and well I liked Red Lake.

1127
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,285
It felt like a good fit.

1128
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,871
And that's the only reason
that you picked them?

1129
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,539
No.

1130
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,543
You're wondering if
I came back for you.

1131
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,378
Of course not.

1132
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,214
What if I did?

1133
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,222
My feet really hurt.

1134
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,975
You're a wimp.

1135
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,101
No.

1136
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,728
Come on.

1137
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,563
Do you want me to carry you?

1138
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,606
No.

1139
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,899
No, don't.

1140
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,109
Don't carry me.

1141
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,240
Sounds like you're
rekindling things.

1142
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,243
No, I just really, I
don't wanna hurt him.

1143
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,453
Yeah, that makes sense.

1144
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,414
I mean it was so bad before.

1145
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,582
You regret it.

1146
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,126
No, I mean yes, of course.

1147
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,211
I regret hurting him.

1148
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,381
But not breaking things
off with him years ago.

1149
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,424
You do regret not
marrying him though.

1150
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,010
I just, I really wish
things were different.

1151
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,470
Like what?

1152
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,638
Like I wish that
we would have met

1153
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,099
when I was at
Oxford, or you know,

1154
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,100
when we were just
a little older,

1155
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,768
not when we were so young.

1156
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,645
How is that
different from today?

1157
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:16,315
I'm just saying that I wish
that the timing was different.

1158
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,567
So you let him go all those
years ago because you had to?

1159
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,735
Yes.

1160
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,696
And now, couldn't
the timing be right?

1161
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,613
No.

1162
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,240
No, no.

1163
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,992
Because you don't
love him anymore?

1164
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,077
[sighs]

1165
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,122
I don't know how I feel
about Jaxson, okay?

1166
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,708
I just know that jumping
into a relationship

1167
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,334
with Jaxson right now,

1168
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,336
that feels wrong.

1169
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,130
Okay, why?

1170
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,008
Because nothing's changed.

1171
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,970
All right. Based on what
little pieces you've told me

1172
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,305
about why you broke up,

1173
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,141
none of them had to do
with you not loving him.

1174
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,311
If nothing's changed, then
you still care about him.

1175
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,443
I should get back to work.

1176
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,529
I should have been a shrink.

1177
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,488
I'd be rich by now.

1178
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,491
The Great Dr. Dean.

1179
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,535
[light music]

1180
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,330
[keys clacking]

1181
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,259
Hmm.

1182
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,511
[knocking]

1183
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,682
Hey.

1184
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,808
Hi.

1185
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,771
Sorry to interrupt your
gingerbread obsession.

1186
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,230
It's for work.

1187
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,065
Really?

1188
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,524
Yeah.

1189
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,652
They're Christmas decorations
for the Christmas party.

1190
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,031
Or at least they will
be when I'm done.

1191
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,824
Want some help?

1192
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,201
Yeah sure, come on in.

1193
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,248
What is it, like a creative
mind thing or something?

1194
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,249
What?

1195
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,796
Just your propensity for
artistic perfection over there.

1196
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,548
I mean I'm still
working on this roof.

1197
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,801
Well I made one of these
every year growing up.

1198
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,386
Until college.

1199
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,179
My roommates would
make fun of me.

1200
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,681
How did you know you
would still be good at it?

1201
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,725
Well how do you know I don't
make five of these a year?

1202
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,645
Okay, just for that, you're
gonna make another one.

1203
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,562
Oh.

1204
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,357
[growling]

1205
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,441
Okay, hold on.

1206
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,237
It's not.

1207
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,781
What do we got going
on, okay, let's see.

1208
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,574
Now, the trick is.

1209
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,619
Mm, pretty good.

1210
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,414
Not to use too much.
Okay.

1211
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,749
Just enough.

1212
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,420
See?

1213
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,588
Now, put it on.

1214
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,257
Okay.

1215
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,592
That's it, and just hold
it for a few seconds.

1216
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,725
And that's it.

1217
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,768
That's it?

1218
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,437
Mhmm.

1219
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,439
All right, wow.

1220
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,273
See?

1221
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,193
You know growing up,
I thought it'd be cool

1222
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,403
to live in one of these.

1223
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,321
A gingerbread house?

1224
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,824
Okay, maybe it's just the candy.

1225
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,576
Or a Hansel and Gretel thing?

1226
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,787
Yeah, maybe when I was little.

1227
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,873
No, I think I just like
what it represents.

1228
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,416
Warmth, comfort, home.

1229
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,294
Someplace to call my own.

1230
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:28,299
You know, everything
you care about's inside.

1231
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,300
I think it's a little tiny

1232
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,219
to have everything
you care about inside.

1233
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,137
It's true.

1234
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,473
I need a place to
put all my books.

1235
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,813
Thank you.

1236
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:44,482
You can definitely tell
which ones are yours

1237
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,317
and which ones are mine.

1238
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,360
I wouldn't worry about it.
No one at the party will.

1239
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,154
Thank you for your help.

1240
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:50,863
You're welcome.

1241
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,781
Oh, hey.

1242
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,203
I have something for you.

1243
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,662
Oh, a manuscript.

1244
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,500
I was hoping I could
get your take on it.

1245
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,709
Wait, is this that
Christmas one?

1246
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,710
That was really fast.

1247
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,670
No, no, this is an older story.

1248
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,215
I just never
finished it till now.

1249
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,384
Oh well are you sure
it's not under contract

1250
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,719
with your old publisher?

1251
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,639
No, I wrote this well
before my career took off.

1252
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,349
Probably still needs a polish.

1253
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:22,186
Well, I've got one other
author in the queue, but yeah.

1254
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,395
Oh, that's fine.

1255
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,897
Tell you will read it?

1256
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,190
Of course.

1257
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,234
Thanks.

1258
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,571
I'm hearing next year's
budget will be cut

1259
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,240
in most departments

1260
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,283
with the exception of marketing.

1261
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,910
So with Jaxson Jones on board,

1262
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,578
we wanna push that even more.

1263
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,288
All right, well with
what his books could do

1264
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,206
for our company, it makes sense

1265
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,375
that we'd want to
capitalize on his name.

1266
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,584
Good.

1267
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,545
Chester has the
departmental budgets.

1268
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,420
Okay.

1269
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,755
Thank you.

1270
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,674
Please please review these.

1271
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,260
Nobody in accounting appreciates

1272
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,262
ticked off phone
calls and emails

1273
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,347
accusing us of
cutting their budget

1274
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,474
that they had already
spent by June.

1275
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,684
It wasn't me.

1276
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,394
I know, I know, I
was just saying that

1277
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,729
because I'm trying
to keep myself

1278
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,440
from pointing out the
audiobook division.

1279
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,401
Okay, that should do it.

1280
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,402
Thanks, everyone.

1281
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:18,951
So how are things
going with Jaxson?

1282
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,286
What do you mean?

1283
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:26,292
Is he playing nice,
or being all ego?

1284
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,295
Oh, yeah no, he's
not like that at all.

1285
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,922
He's very nice.

1286
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,632
What do you think about him?

1287
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,760
I mean, you know, as a date.

1288
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,596
For who?

1289
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,055
For me?

1290
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,640
I was thinking
maybe he makes sense

1291
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,934
as my date to the
Christmas party.

1292
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,937
Oh, well, is he your type?

1293
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:47,771
He's handsome.

1294
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,607
Yeah.

1295
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,442
I suppose so.

1296
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:55,321
The good thing is, work can
be my excuse for asking.

1297
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:58,324
It gives me a
chance to explore if

1298
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,701
maybe something
more could happen.

1299
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,995
That's a good strategy.

1300
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,622
When's he coming in next?

1301
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,459
I really don't, I don't know.

1302
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,087
Do you think maybe you
can invent a reason

1303
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,631
for him to come by again?

1304
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,676
Yeah.

1305
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,304
I could probably
think of something.

1306
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,431
Okay, thank you Maggie.

1307
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,932
Sure, yeah.

1308
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,607
Hey, Maggie.

1309
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,858
I thought you might
want to see this.

1310
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,653
It's the sales reports
for your authors' books.

1311
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,530
Oh great, yeah, thank you.

1312
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,784
Hey, do you have anything
for Jaxson Jones,

1313
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,494
anything that he needs to sign?

1314
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,664
No, that'd be the
legal department.

1315
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,706
Oh, yeah, right.

1316
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,833
Yeah, I'm sorry, sorry
about that, thanks.

1317
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,126
Did you need something?

1318
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,503
Oh it's just Amanda.

1319
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,798
Just, you know we're
looking for a reason

1320
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,466
for him to drop by the office.

1321
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,886
Oh, we did give
him a signing bonus

1322
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,681
but it hasn't gone
out in the mail yet.

1323
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,890
Oh yeah.

1324
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,558
Yeah, that'd be
perfect, thank you.

1325
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,476
Yeah.

1326
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,901
[sighs]

1327
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,569
Hey, Jaxson.

1328
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,654
Yeah, this is Maggie.

1329
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:22,491
Listen, accounting has
your signing bonus here.

1330
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,076
Thought maybe you
could just swing by

1331
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,578
and pick it up instead of
us sticking it in the mail.

1332
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,538
It might be safer.

1333
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,374
Okay, great.

1334
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,376
Yeah, thanks.

1335
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,506
The mail, might be safer, oh my.

1336
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,478
Jaxson.

1337
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,063
I guess I got here a
little late, Maggie‐‐

1338
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,482
I have your check for you.

1339
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,568
Oh, thank you.

1340
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,236
Look, I know Maggie's
taking care of you

1341
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,113
but I would love
to hear firsthand

1342
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,573
what you've got in the works.

1343
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,533
So would you like to
grab a bite to eat?

1344
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,827
Sure.

1345
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,786
Sounds good.

1346
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,579
Okay.
All right.

1347
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,125
I don't know why it bothers you.

1348
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,002
You both moved on years ago.

1349
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,920
Who cares if he goes
out with your boss?

1350
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,507
Well, it's just that it's
inappropriate, isn't it?

1351
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,550
I don't know.

1352
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,762
I mean Amanda's my boss
and she's my friend

1353
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,055
and if she and
Jaxson were an item,

1354
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,141
I mean wouldn't that be weird?

1355
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,476
It'll only be weird for you.

1356
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,560
And only if you still,

1357
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,813
do you still care about him?

1358
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,775
No, there's just, you
know, there's history.

1359
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,610
Does Amanda know about it?

1360
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,111
No, why would she?

1361
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,738
Well I say you could
warn her off from Jaxson

1362
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,072
if she's your friend.

1363
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,908
He wasn't anything
to brag about before

1364
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,951
and he's probably
more shallow now.

1365
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,120
No he's not.

1366
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:54,458
Look, he'd actually be
pretty good for her.

1367
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,628
Then what's the problem?

1368
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,797
I need more sugar.

1369
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,598
Maggie, hey.

1370
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,142
I'm just reminding everyone to
RSVP for the Christmas party.

1371
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,686
We're finalizing things with
caterers, I need numbers.

1372
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,979
Oh yeah, yep, okay.

1373
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,648
I will do that, thanks.

1374
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,941
You can just tell me now.

1375
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,819
Yeah, I'm going.

1376
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,154
Are you bringing a guest?

1377
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,618
No, no.

1378
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,495
Okay, got it, thanks.

1379
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,833
Hey.

1380
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,876
Hey.

1381
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,170
So how did it go with Jaxson?

1382
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,130
Good.

1383
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,007
He's easy to talk to.

1384
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,175
Oh, that's great.

1385
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,595
I'm surprised he's not married.

1386
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,972
Seems like he'd be taken

1387
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,015
but I guess that's good for me.

1388
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,227
What'd you guys end up doing?

1389
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,186
Just dinner.

1390
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,563
The work connection helped,

1391
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:58,855
gave me something to talk about.

1392
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,357
Yeah.

1393
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,860
Oh, I mean to remind you
that I have that list of guys

1394
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,862
if you wanted to ever
go back through it.

1395
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,866
I think I'd like to see if
it works out with Jaxson.

1396
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,035
So why don't we
put that on hold?

1397
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,287
Oh yeah.

1398
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,204
Yeah, okay.

1399
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,207
You guys gonna go to the
Christmas party then?

1400
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,875
Yeah.

1401
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,169
You don't think that's
a mistake, do you?

1402
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,879
No.

1403
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,214
No, it's great.

1404
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,216
Okay, good.

1405
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,056
[light whimsical music]

1406
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,748
Hey, everything okay?

1407
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,043
Yeah, yeah I'm
good, how about you?

1408
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,127
How you doing, Marvin?

1409
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,963
Good, good, yeah.

1410
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,090
Look, I'm really
sorry about Amanda.

1411
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,967
Yeah, me too.

1412
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,093
Yeah she seemed nice.

1413
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,973
But maybe, not really
sure what she wants.

1414
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,100
Yeah, yeah.

1415
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,727
How's the reading?

1416
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,230
Oh, you know, I haven't
really decided yet.

1417
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,148
That bad?

1418
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,278
Yeah I can't really
put my finger on it.

1419
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,988
What's it about?

1420
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,908
Well, supposedly it's a romance

1421
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,077
but I'm already on what, page 30

1422
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,703
and they've broken up.

1423
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,121
Not much of a romance.

1424
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:38,955
No.

1425
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,794
Something about it seems really
familiar though, you know?

1426
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,296
I think the characters, the
characters remind me of,

1427
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,305
oh you've gotta be kidding me.

1428
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,142
[knocking]

1429
00:57:59,142 --> 00:57:59,976
Hey.

1430
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,771
Is everything okay?

1431
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:04,815
Is your book a joke?

1432
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:07,818
I haven't heard that about
my writing in a while.

1433
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,277
You had to have known
that I would have seen

1434
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,195
right through this.

1435
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,822
Maggie, calm down.

1436
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,281
The story about a boy who
falls in love with a girl

1437
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,826
until her family convinces
her to push him away?

1438
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,786
Yes, it is that.

1439
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:20,330
I don't appreciate
your rewrite of history

1440
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,874
nor do I want to be a
subject of one of your books.

1441
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,000
I changed the names.

1442
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,879
Oh right, like Regina
who's obviously Nicole.

1443
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,715
That doesn't make her
any less of a villain.

1444
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,340
Have you met her?

1445
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,800
Or Sarah, any less me

1446
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,135
or my parents from
being my parents.

1447
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,886
You write what you know.

1448
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,722
It's the number one
rule of writing.

1449
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,391
Yeah it's also the number
one way of alienating people.

1450
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,687
Needless to say, we won't
be publishing your book.

1451
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,857
Well I'm sorry
you feel that way.

1452
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,194
So much for letting the past go.

1453
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,824
[door slamming]

1454
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,495
Yeah, it's bad enough how
he writes me, but you, ugh.

1455
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,247
My character is mean.

1456
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,874
I wasn't like that.

1457
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,084
I just, you know, I never
saw this side of him before.

1458
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,043
I thought that he,

1459
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,338
you know, no, this settles it.

1460
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,216
I had my doubts but
no, this is done.

1461
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,801
You had doubts?

1462
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,052
I never did.

1463
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,181
And I was totally right to
warn mom and dad about Jaxson.

1464
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,182
Wait, what?

1465
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,057
What?

1466
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,394
You warned mom and
dad about Jaxson?

1467
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,896
They were concerned anyway,

1468
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,190
with both of you barely
being out of high school.

1469
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,941
I was older than that, Nicole.

1470
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,443
By a year, maybe.

1471
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,945
Either way, it just
wasn't right for you.

1472
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,906
What, the marriage or Jaxson?

1473
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,199
Both.

1474
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,533
Especially since he
didn't have any real plan

1475
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,203
of how to take care of
you besides writing.

1476
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,038
Like I couldn't fend for myself?

1477
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,080
Doesn't matter now.

1478
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,374
This proves that mom,
dad and I were right.

1479
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,962
Yeah I just don't know
how I'm gonna deal

1480
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:51,963
with him at work.

1481
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,050
Well, like you said.

1482
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,761
Maybe it's time to move on.

1483
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,100
Hey, hey.

1484
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,769
Watch.

1485
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,978
You ever notice
how often he comes

1486
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,104
and talks with Amanda?

1487
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,483
Well, yeah, yeah,
why wouldn't he?

1488
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,567
He's the head of accounting

1489
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:14,778
and he goes over credit
card charges with her?

1490
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,071
He has a whole department.

1491
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:17,948
Well he.

1492
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,243
Oh.

1493
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,495
You think that he's making
up reasons to see her?

1494
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,455
Interesting huh?

1495
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,290
Huh.

1496
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,465
I hate to see you go.

1497
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,176
Would it help if I
shuffled your workload?

1498
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,302
No, it's not that.

1499
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,598
It's just, I think it's
time for me to move on.

1500
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,893
I am a bit concerned about
some of your deadlines.

1501
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,520
Oh well the Wilmington
Heights manuscript

1502
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,314
is nearly finalized, but I'll
make sure of it before I go.

1503
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,358
And the others
aren't gonna suffer

1504
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,986
by being passed off
to other editors.

1505
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,530
[phone buzzing]

1506
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,156
Jaxson.

1507
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,242
He's offering to pick me
up for the Christmas party.

1508
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,285
That's kind of sweet.

1509
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,995
Yeah it's good.

1510
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,876
Is there any way I can
convince you to stay?

1511
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,379
No, but I'm not leaving
till the end of the month

1512
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,548
so I won't leave you in a lurch.

1513
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,508
Okay.

1514
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,514
Logic told Dana that the robbery

1515
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,182
wasn't aimed at Russo.

1516
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:31,187
Logic was also the first
thing Dana ignored.

1517
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,316
Perhaps it was a
lapse in the calm

1518
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:38,194
and collective mask
she'd normally maintain.

1519
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:42,032
But a hostage situation
had that effect on her.

1520
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,491
Is Baker one of your authors?

1521
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:46,870
Yes.

1522
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:48,538
He's good.

1523
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,874
Mhmm.

1524
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,500
Maggie.

1525
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,212
Are you gonna finish
reading my manuscript?

1526
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,547
[sighs] Probably not.

1527
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,009
I'm not your editor anymore.

1528
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,303
Listen, can you
just let me explain?

1529
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,055
I'm leaving Red Lake Publishing.

1530
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:07,223
Why?

1531
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,559
It doesn't matter.

1532
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,106
What if I told you I
did switch publishers

1533
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,067
when I found out you
were at Red Lake?

1534
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,027
I would say I hope you
didn't lose a lot of money

1535
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,195
on your prior contract.

1536
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,989
I wanted to be near you again.

1537
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,077
All this time, I never
stopped thinking about you.

1538
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,496
Yeah that's pretty obvious.

1539
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:31,581
What?

1540
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,499
Look.

1541
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,252
Did you come back to vilify me?

1542
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,254
To rub the past in my face?

1543
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,590
And now you're dating Amanda,

1544
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,009
I mean is that supposed
to make me jealous?

1545
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,261
That's what you think?

1546
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,640
I see what you're doing, Jaxson.

1547
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,184
And your Untitled book,
frankly, it says it all.

1548
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,227
Yes it does.

1549
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,063
But if that's what you're
choosing to believe

1550
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,107
I guess there's no
convincing you otherwise.

1551
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,944
You know what, this
is all so familiar.

1552
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,279
You've always been so quick
to think the worst of me.

1553
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,739
I guess whatever's
easier, right?

1554
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,116
What?

1555
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,117
At least this time
it's your choice,

1556
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,201
not your family's.

1557
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,455
[clears throat]

1558
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,958
I'm sorry, continue.

1559
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,379
The words were oddly quiet,

1560
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,589
yet Russo's ears were roaring.

1561
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,967
Hey Marvin.

1562
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:24,968
Hey.

1563
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,429
You know, world famous
Christmas chowder.

1564
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,723
Thank you, that
looks really good.

1565
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:30,974
You'll love it.

1566
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:31,933
Okay.

1567
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,524
Hey, Chester.

1568
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,442
Hey Maggie.

1569
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,735
Mind if I sit with you?

1570
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:42,610
Yeah.

1571
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:48,992
You okay?

1572
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,618
What?

1573
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,165
You just look like
you've had a rough day.

1574
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,000
Not just today.

1575
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,334
What do you mean?

1576
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:01,421
Christmas is just, it's
a hard time for me.

1577
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,672
Why?

1578
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,506
Well.

1579
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,551
Well let me tell you a story.

1580
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,927
I mean you're an editor,

1581
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,347
right, you can tell me if this
would be a good book, right?

1582
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,599
Okay.

1583
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,017
Okay, so.

1584
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,019
Christmas time, six years ago.

1585
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:22,692
There's a man named Lester.

1586
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:29,199
And he's dating the
love of his life

1587
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,327
and his career's on the rise
with promise of promotion

1588
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,370
and stability to
come like any day.

1589
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,082
And then the woman that he loves

1590
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,335
who we'll call Miranda,

1591
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,673
well she gets this
huge promotion

1592
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,384
while his doesn't materialize
for quite some time.

1593
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:54,057
And foolishly, Lester
blames her for it.

1594
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:58,561
So much so that it drives a
wedge between him and her.

1595
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,731
It's like he blames her
for his circumstance

1596
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,734
and then he breaks up with her.

1597
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:08,530
Broke her heart.

1598
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,408
So what happened to them?

1599
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,494
Well she thrived in her new job

1600
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,163
and you know, he eventually
got everything he wanted

1601
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,748
with his career, but,

1602
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,127
he always remembers
this time of year

1603
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,169
what he did to her,

1604
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,339
wonders what could have been,

1605
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,218
is doomed to wonder
till the end of time.

1606
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,763
Doesn't sound like
a very happy ending.

1607
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,767
No, no, not a good book, huh?

1608
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:39,727
I'm sorry.

1609
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,105
Yeah.

1610
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,439
Poor Lester, huh?

1611
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,776
Yeah, poor Lester.

1612
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,742
Hey, HR dropped off
tickets for the party.

1613
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,286
Oh great, thanks.

1614
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,122
So how's the editor
shuffle going?

1615
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,415
It'll be fine.

1616
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,624
I haven't told everyone yet

1617
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,293
but after Christmas I will.

1618
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,460
Okay.

1619
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,628
You all set with Jaxson?

1620
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,214
Yeah, we're all set
for Friday night.

1621
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,384
No, I meant with the new editor.

1622
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,595
Oh, sorry.

1623
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:17,432
So I'm debating between
Brooks and David.

1624
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,474
David.

1625
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,602
David for sure, he'll
be a much better fit.

1626
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,270
You think so?
Yeah.

1627
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,730
Oh hey.

1628
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,315
I am really glad
that you found a date

1629
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,774
for the Christmas party.

1630
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,568
I'm sorry it didn't work
out with one of your guys.

1631
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,570
Oh no, no, it's fine.

1632
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,448
I do appreciate
you trying though.

1633
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,782
It was really nice of you.

1634
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:35,950
Yeah.

1635
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,368
[knocking] Hey.

1636
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,371
I have the updated
numbers for November.

1637
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,623
Oh great, just set them there.

1638
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,498
Great.

1639
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,335
Hey.
Hi.

1640
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,674
So did it always bother
you getting dates

1641
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,176
for Christmas parties?

1642
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,180
Or did that start
a few years ago?

1643
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,267
Maybe.

1644
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,186
You think he regrets it?

1645
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,646
Whether he does or not,

1646
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,148
it's not my problem.

1647
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,525
Okay.

1648
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,824
[light music]

1649
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,506
[sighs]

1650
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,555
His hands felt clammy.

1651
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:24,434
After years of wanting to
see her again, here she was.

1652
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,436
And he feared more than anything

1653
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,771
that he would ruin this chance.

1654
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,356
They held a common
hope between them

1655
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,692
one neither would
or could admit yet.

1656
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,821
The hope for a chance without
the interference of outsiders.

1657
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,449
Just two hearts yearning
for the love of the other.

1658
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,587
She held her breath as
he stood before her.

1659
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,465
"I never stopped loving you.

1660
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,384
"It didn't matter to me what
I might give up or risk.

1661
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,637
"I had to take the leap
and ask you one question."

1662
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,723
She waited, not daring to hope

1663
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,308
he was feeling what she felt.

1664
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,935
"Could you love me again?"

1665
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,814
Relief, euphoria, joy,
and certainly love

1666
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,483
filled her soul.

1667
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,485
She pulled him towards
her, embracing him

1668
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,612
like she never meant
to let him go again.

1669
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,699
And as they kissed, he
felt her lips against his

1670
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:25,661
and she whispered one
sweet word, "Yes."

1671
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,302
Our Christmas gift to dad.

1672
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,179
A hammock stand.

1673
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,347
You owe me 40 bucks.

1674
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,349
Wait, that's what you chose?

1675
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,768
You know that old
hammock he's had forever?

1676
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,729
Yeah, the one he's never used?

1677
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,856
Because he didn't
have a way to hang it.

1678
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,857
Mhmm.

1679
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,651
You couldn't think of
anything, so zip it.

1680
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,362
Here.

1681
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,199
On Friday, Andrew and
I are taking the kids

1682
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,201
on a Christmas train ride.

1683
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,369
You wanna go?

1684
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,745
That's really sweet, thanks

1685
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,707
but I have that company
Christmas party, you know?

1686
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,250
You going with anyone?

1687
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,460
No, I'm manning the
toy donation table,

1688
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,670
the one for charity.

1689
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,798
I thought you might ask Jaxson.

1690
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,384
It's a little late for that.

1691
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:23,010
He and Amanda are
going together.

1692
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,637
So you wanted to ask him.

1693
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,390
Can we just not talk about this?

1694
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:29,559
I don't need
another conversation

1695
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,687
where you tell me about
how horrible he is

1696
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,731
and how you were right.

1697
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,234
Are you okay?

1698
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:40,862
I just, I can't.

1699
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,408
I know that there were reasons
that you disapproved of him

1700
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,326
and I can remember excuses

1701
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,870
and that's why I gave in

1702
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,290
but there had to
be something else.

1703
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,417
That couldn't have just been it.

1704
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,960
Maggie, it's done.

1705
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,714
Just don't drive yourself
crazy rehashing it.

1706
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,966
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

1707
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,927
You already have everything
that really matters.

1708
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,554
Please, can you just tell me?

1709
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,514
I really need some
closure on this.

1710
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,603
You know, looking
back on it now,

1711
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,441
my objection to Jaxson and him

1712
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:22,737
wanting to be an
author was an excuse.

1713
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,615
The whole age thing, I mean,

1714
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,452
I mean mom and dad
were concerned,

1715
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,288
but maybe the age
thing bothered me.

1716
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,416
I'm a big sister after all.

1717
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,794
Wait, what do you mean?

1718
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,590
There you were, all
ready to be grown up

1719
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,550
and marry someone.

1720
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,970
I was embarrassed, like
it should be me first.

1721
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,555
I had no one back then.

1722
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,767
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

1723
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,894
It's hard to admit
your own insecurities.

1724
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,022
With me being concerned too,

1725
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,441
I guess it was easy
for mom, dad, and me

1726
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,361
to gang up on you and
convince you to turn him down.

1727
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,780
So you're saying
there's no good reason

1728
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,989
why you disapproved of him?

1729
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,991
Well, I don't know
if I'd say that.

1730
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,451
Nicole!

1731
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,411
It's not that I didn't
want you to be happy,

1732
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,746
I didn't think of it like that.

1733
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,667
I just, I was only thinking
about how it would affect me.

1734
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,795
I was jealous.

1735
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,297
I'm so sorry, Maggie.

1736
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,471
What do you think of
Jaxson now that he's,

1737
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,515
now that he's back?

1738
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,602
I didn't wanna be
wrong about him

1739
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,313
but maybe I am.

1740
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,316
You must think I'm horrible.

1741
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,864
I'm more worried about
what he thinks of me.

1742
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:54,704
[gentle music]

1743
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,665
Hey, you know that
story that Jaxson wrote,

1744
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,125
the one that I let you read?

1745
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,544
Where I'm portrayed as the
wicked witch of the west?

1746
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,795
Right, yeah that one.

1747
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,047
I thought he was being cruel

1748
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,467
but it turns out if
you get to the ending,

1749
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,804
I think he was
trying to help me see

1750
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,389
how he really feels.

1751
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,641
You still care for him too.

1752
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:17,977
Then tell him that.

1753
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:21,480
Look, he and Amanda are going

1754
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,773
to the Christmas party together.

1755
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,025
I can't do that to her.

1756
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,403
She deserves a nice
guy and he is one.

1757
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,823
If he's loved you
all these years,

1758
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,409
don't you think he deserves
to know how you feel?

1759
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,370
What do I even say?

1760
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,582
I don't even know
where to start.

1761
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:58,059
Okay.

1762
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,901
[sighs]

1763
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,449
[grand holiday music]

1764
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,035
Thank you.

1765
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,119
A pleasure.

1766
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,755
Annette, good to see you.

1767
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,632
Have you met Jaxson Jones?

1768
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:30,549
Hi, nice to meet you.

1769
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,509
Hi, you too.

1770
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,218
Hi.
Hi.

1771
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,933
[whimsical music]

1772
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:42,812
Here you go.

1773
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:43,688
Oh great, thank you.

1774
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:44,814
This is perfect.

1775
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,781
Good to see where it goes.

1776
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,578
Eventually, another month,
we should have something fun.

1777
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,496
Here we go.

1778
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,914
Thank you for your generosity.

1779
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,165
It's some matchbox cars.

1780
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,667
Not sure it's that generous.

1781
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,626
But I didn't wanna
be the only one

1782
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,961
who didn't bring something.

1783
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,964
Well, it's the thought
that counts, right?

1784
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:10,840
I thought so.

1785
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,092
Have you tried the food?

1786
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,678
No, I'm not really that hungry.

1787
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,013
Well, I am.

1788
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,181
No, save, stop, no, no, no.

1789
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,141
Put it.

1790
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,021
Ah, I see Amanda found a date.

1791
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,023
So much for your
matchmaking streak.

1792
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,526
Yeah, I'm beginning to doubt
I have any real mojo there.

1793
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,861
Well, you still tried.

1794
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,030
As you said, it's the
thought that counts.

1795
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,159
Maybe you should set Chester up.

1796
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,452
Oh no.

1797
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,664
No, I think that's one match
I'm not gonna be able to force.

1798
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,126
Ah, I see.

1799
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:49,712
What?

1800
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:50,671
Nothing.
What?

1801
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,006
Nothing.

1802
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,007
Why don't you go dance?

1803
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,967
No, no one's dancing yet.

1804
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,886
Mingle then, get a drink

1805
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,846
and all that stuff.

1806
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,057
No, I need to stay here
and take the gifts.

1807
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,224
It's my job.

1808
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,225
Yeah well, you're
a real critical cog

1809
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,019
in the machine there, Maggie.

1810
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,729
Go on, I'll make sure
the whole operation

1811
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,730
doesn't fall apart.

1812
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:08,564
Dean.

1813
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,857
Go!

1814
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:11,901
Go, you can get me one of
those little cream puff things.

1815
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,071
Are you really excited
about a cream puff?

1816
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:15,988
Yeah.

1817
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,074
Okay, all right.

1818
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,700
One cream puff coming up.

1819
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,875
Oh, it's great to meet you.
Likewise.

1820
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,336
Let me know if you have
any problems with Red Lake.

1821
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,755
I know how to keep
those guys in line.

1822
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,925
Very funny, Mr.
Gordon. [laughing]

1823
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,012
Nice party.

1824
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,222
Thank you.

1825
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,098
We try.

1826
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:45,935
Are you having a good time?

1827
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:46,936
Yes, thank you.

1828
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,942
Marguerite, come
meet Jaxson Jones.

1829
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,068
Oh hi.
Hi.

1830
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,697
[gentle piano music]

1831
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,582
[sighs]

1832
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,961
Hey.

1833
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,087
Oh, hi.

1834
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,799
How's the toy drive going?

1835
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,134
Oh it's fine.

1836
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,052
You know, Dean's covering
the table for me.

1837
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,095
Good, good.

1838
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,598
Make sure you get a
chance to enjoy the party.

1839
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:26,934
Are you?

1840
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,981
I think it's just
business with Jaxson.

1841
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,108
Oh.

1842
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,653
Oh, I'm sorry.

1843
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,823
I can't pretend there's
any chemistry between us.

1844
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:41,991
It's all right, though.

1845
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,911
You know, for all my
supposed matchmaking skills,

1846
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,288
I failed to see the chemistry

1847
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:50,624
that you already
have with Chester.

1848
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,629
That's long gone.

1849
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,298
Is it?

1850
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,844
You know that he's sorry, right?

1851
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:02,761
I do.

1852
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,849
So why do you keep
making him suffer?

1853
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,101
That's not what I'm doing.

1854
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,853
Do you know what you're doing?

1855
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,401
Look, if the situation
was reversed,

1856
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,486
what would you want him to do?

1857
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,030
You met all these other guys

1858
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,114
and you went out with Marvin

1859
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,282
and I kept thinking to myself,

1860
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:26,368
what was it that I'm missing?

1861
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,704
Is there some kind of quality

1862
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,165
or character trait that
you're looking for in a guy?

1863
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,878
But you didn't think that you
could find a perfect match

1864
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,214
because you already had one.

1865
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,717
I thought I had.

1866
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,055
And you think that
doesn't happen twice.

1867
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,017
Maybe it doesn't.

1868
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,355
That's all the more reason
not to turn your back on it.

1869
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,153
Come on.

1870
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,075
[energetic music]

1871
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,831
Hey Chester, merry Christmas.

1872
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,167
Hey, merry Christmas.

1873
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,881
Do you still like to dance?

1874
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,218
No, not really.

1875
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:25,094
Oh.

1876
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:31,392
I never really felt comfortable
with anyone except you.

1877
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,396
You wanna dance with me then?

1878
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,274
I'd like that.

1879
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,463
So do I get credit for that one?

1880
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,424
Oh yeah, you
definitely called that.

1881
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,052
I'm really happy for her.

1882
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,980
You know I got this under
control here, right?

1883
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,856
So?

1884
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,065
I have to run.

1885
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,233
It was a pleasure
meeting you guys.

1886
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,276
Pleasure meeting you, take care.

1887
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,283
Yeah, thanks.

1888
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:38,667
Jaxson.

1889
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:43,839
Go back inside.

1890
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,632
Party's still going strong.

1891
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,427
Yeah, I saw that you
were leaving already.

1892
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,804
Not much reason to stay.

1893
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,475
Hey look, I wanted to
run something by you.

1894
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,142
Does it matter?

1895
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,519
I mean, you're leaving your job.

1896
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,979
I'll just run whatever
by the next editor.

1897
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,939
No, this isn't about work.

1898
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,444
Can you just listen?

1899
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:08,822
I...

1900
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,371
I never stopped loving you.

1901
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,383
It didn't matter to me what
I might give up or risk.

1902
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,552
I had to take the leap

1903
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,638
and I had to ask
you one question.

1904
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,851
Could you love me again?

1905
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:41,063
It's good writing.

1906
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:44,983
Yeah.

1907
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,070
I borrowed it from this
half‐decent author that I know.

1908
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,571
Hmm.

1909
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,074
I thought you didn't
like his writing.

1910
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,409
Well you gotta get to the end

1911
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,577
to really appreciate
the whole story, right?

1912
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,086
Is that?

1913
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,422
Yeah.

1914
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,219
The only thing that my
sister and my parents

1915
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,262
got right about us

1916
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,347
is that I was too young.

1917
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:22,271
I was too young to know how
to stand up for what I knew.

1918
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:29,278
And that was that
you were everything

1919
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,446
that I always wanted.

1920
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,952
And somehow I let
myself be persuaded

1921
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,662
thinking that I
couldn't marry you

1922
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:42,207
and that was a horrible mistake.

1923
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,046
But the real mistake
was letting you go.

1924
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:53,927
Maggie.

1925
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:56,972
You say that now.

1926
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,392
And I would be lying if I said

1927
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,603
that wasn't what I
wanted to hear, but,

1928
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:06,482
your family, they hate
me for some reason.

1929
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:11,445
And are you really gonna
choose me over them?

1930
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:15,282
Yeah, if that's what
it came down to, yes.

1931
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,411
We've changed, right?

1932
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:25,459
And now they see
what makes me happy.

1933
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,172
I haven't been happy
since then, Jaxson.

1934
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,677
Every couple of years I would,

1935
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,180
I would move around looking
for a different job,

1936
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,016
looking for that thing
that would fill that void,

1937
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,436
and nothing worked.

1938
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,190
I still miss you.

1939
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,528
You must be freezing.

1940
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,696
It's not really the cold.

1941
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,114
Sure it's not.

1942
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,493
No I'm just really nervous
about what you're going to say.

1943
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,455
Are you really?

1944
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,665
How could I not be?

1945
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,209
After how I acted.

1946
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,713
Could you really love me again?

[uplifting music]

1948
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,229
Yes.

1949
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,188
Yeah.

[energetic Christmas music]

1951
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,339
I love it.

1952
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,133
It's such a unique
spin for you too,

1953
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,260
I mean I kept waiting
for the mystery

1954
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,679
or the action to kick
in, like some bad guy

the Christmas tree.

totally worked without it.

glad you liked it.

Thanks so much.

are gonna be crushed.

for loving my editor.

until your sales tank.

we would be here right now

else has changed.
