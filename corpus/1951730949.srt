When what was amused!
What place is this?

3
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:27,541
This zone was of the soldiers.

4
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:29,768
The best place in order that
camps what I already saw.

5
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:31,768
It is brilliant.

6
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,591
What is that?

7
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,784
The ladies like of champagne.

8
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,402
You know that the champagne gives me sob.

9
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:50,055
It is trying to seduce me, Mr. Turner?

10
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,881
Only I want to celebrate this moment.

11
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,768
Definitely you á the woman for me.

12
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,752
Respect sweats decision.

13
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,367
I can wait.

14
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:15,590
You cost that.

15
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,637
Are you well?

16
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:42,319
Yes, only I have some câibras.

17
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,405
For what-?

18
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:48,335
It comes here.

19
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,588
Listen.

20
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:54,170
Do we return for house
and a doctor examines him, yes?

21
00:02:56,705 --> 00:03:00,248
What thinks that it happened?

22
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,214
I do not know, wanted.

23
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,597
Oh, let me see.

24
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:33,984
I will be going to help it.

25
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,848
I do not like this, Steve.

26
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,040
I will stay well.

27
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,473
Be careful.

28
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,162
What happened?

29
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:51,917

30
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:02,080

31
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:04,109
God, I lost the keys!

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,168
Diabos, darling, let's go!

33
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,228
Hurry up!

34
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,532

35
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:20,868
Help me, Steve!

36
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,834
Cursed-

37
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,776

38
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:32,223
Let's go, it enters. Enter!

39
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,189
One gives the keys.

40
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:38,697
Quick! close the window, Steve!

41
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:40,959
Lift it!

42
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,151
Stop looking at the map!
Let's go away from here!

43
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,222
I am trying!

44
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,773
No!

45
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,448
Follow me.

46
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,123
What place is this?

47
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,697
Listen.

48
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:02,445
You if ofereu like volunteer, Simon!

49
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:05,234
Ear, do I know him?

50
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,698
It can be. Who is you?

51
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,692
Steve. Steve Turner.

52
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,310
Yes, well, I do not know him.

53
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,842
However it seems to me known.

54
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,490
Well, I did some actings.

55
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,921
Jake! When it took care!

56
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:33,689
Quilting stitch to ignore it.
Hello, I am Lin.

57
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:35,052
Hello, I am Steve.

58
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:36,708
She is my girlfriend Midami.

59
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:39,206
Mimi. My parents were hippies.

60
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:41,493
What diabos is happening?

61
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,576
Survival.

62
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,203
They are Slasher and D.J.

63
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes.

64
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,590
And Trent.

65
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,621
You are a very strange man.

66
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,306
Come.

67
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,461
We go.

68
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:01,487
We go, cursed wretch.

69
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,829
Place us there.

70
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,578
She needs to lean.

71
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,559
Ok, calm.

72
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,275
Slasher, D.J., take it for inside.

73
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:31,635
I will finish here. They go.

74
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,241
I have it.

75
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,304
What is happening there?

76
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,327
In a minute we will be selling cars,

77
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,049
perhaps celebrating in the night club.

78
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:45,514
You are married.

79
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,043
And soon the place colapsa.

80
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:49,364
And the rest of the city?

81
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,325
It is a disaster, old man.

82
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:55,106
The persons were shouting,
there was fire. God.

83
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,967
And suddenly,

84
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:59,527
everyone
he began to eat between you.

85
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,111
Simon also saved us.

86
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,608
Yes, Simon. Yes.

87
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,529
He is D.J. I am Slasher.

88
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:08,560
Slasher?

89
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:11,614
Yes, raise one's hands an offer is wanted.

90
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,228
A good agreement is wanted,
lower the prices.

91
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,455
And lower them and lower them.

92
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:21,873
We sell cars.
Slasher sells for the whole country.

93
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,798
What place is this?

94
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,944
I think that it is a station
of microwave outdated NORAD.

95
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:31,097
However perhaps I am mistaken.

96
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,329
I am going to fly his head.

97
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,518
For on my corpse.

98
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,777
What is happening with you, cursed bitch?

99
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,635
It has no idea.
This is the brother of Trent.

100
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,631
This is a thing.

101
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,554
You were giving one almost it kills me
30 seconds ago.

102
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,085
There is no place for them here.

103
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:47,767
What is it doing?

104
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:51,185
Sometime did it have a son?
Or a brother?

105
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:54,443
He loves them incondicionalmente.

106
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,560
Listen, I did already
more than 2000 movies.

107
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,353
I seized more than 8000 types-

108
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,009
to 2013 for the tail-

109
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,871
- mummy!
- I feel, wanted.

110
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,827
Listen, my world,
you are not good for Jane.

111
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,889
I did not even think that
it might have children.

112
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,246
I was pregnant soon.

113
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:15,392
Well, I caught 70 types this week.

114
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,920
However did I miscarry?
Did I give it in adoption? No.

115
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,035
Because to master.
She is of my blood itself.

116
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,602
Therefore I cannot leave
what does Herbert kill.

117
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,278
Listen!

118
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,462
They attacked my daughter in my front.

119
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:35,455
He was 3 years old.

120
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:39,563
They were my neighbors.

121
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,822
He sat down in my patio

122
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:45,781
and it bit the arm
since a chest of chicken is dug.

123
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:49,303
I killed it first.

124
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,072
Is it threatening me, Simon?

125
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,919
Let's love the ghosts.

126
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,451
We cannot kill Herbert.

127
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,800
We have not been eating and have
more two persons to feed.

128
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,887
Are they all crazy?

129
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,284
I think which debit to sit.

130
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:13,138
I am going to shit.

131
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:20,207
I caught animals lovelier than you.

132
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,999
~Você did not hear that, fondness.

133
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:26,717
I am not a child, mummy.

134
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,975
You are a girl. She is my girl.

135
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:32,035
These are my towels.

136
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:34,526
Do not touch them, yes?

137
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,172
Cannot we get on well all?

138
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,630
When what fancied.

139
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,092
Very funny.

140
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,100
Trent, we finish of saving him
the life and that of his brother.

141
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,155
But the day of the Sir will come
like thief in the night,

142
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:56,108
in which the skies will pass
with great crash

143
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,288
and the elements burning
they will be undone

144
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:03,009
and the land and the works that in her are,
they will be burned.

145
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:06,366
2 Peter, chapter 3, verse 10.

146
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,054
It is which God has.

147
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,303
What thing?

148
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:15,922
I do not like his attitude.

149
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:17,821
Trent, his attitude is crap.

150
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:19,046
Imbecile.

151
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:22,232
D.J., place it on the table.

152
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:23,361
Please.

153
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,482
With care.

154
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:43,557
They are Jane, Kylie
and I believe that you know Simon.

155
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:49,003
With care.

156
00:11:57,306 --> 00:12:00,194
I need a cursed mouthful.

157
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:03,306
I need a cursed cigaret.

158
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,394
I need to go away from here.

159
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:09,086
It is making me nervous.

160
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:12,736
Be going to watch the enclosure.

161
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:13,740
Yes, lady.

162
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,031
Thank you.

163
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:18,414
Do you come?

164
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:21,773
Since something had been better to do.

165
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,918
Military training. Sometimes it is useful.

166
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,703
How is she?

167
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:35,688
Well. Only precise to rest.

168
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,645
Do you have water?

169
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:40,467
Yes, clear.

170
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,266
What happened with his arm?

171
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,881
One of these things bit me.

172
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,212
What?

173
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:05,898
I am well.

174
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:07,863
Let me see.

175
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:19,149
Wait here. I return next.

176
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,766
Listen.

177
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,765
Obliged because of helping us.

178
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:59,099
How did it find this place?

179
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,445
It was coming here from boy.

180
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,202
With my oldest brother.

181
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:10,586
Vínhamnos to camp
and we were playing of war

182
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:14,696
of killing and deluding the enemy.

183
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:16,164
And here we are.

184
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,428
It is made graceful as everything ended.

185
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,515
Does it think that that is made graceful?

186
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:31,167
20 years of service.

187
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:35,554
Soon in my last horse,
I decided what was sufficient.

188
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:37,979
What happens if he sees me doing this?

189
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:39,903
She is still pure.

190
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,259
I have been watching it.

191
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,344
Only it is waiting
is not the certain man, wanted?

192
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:49,167
It was going to make the commercial part.

193
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:53,020
To produce, this type of things.

194
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,377
It was in my party itself of farewell.

195
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,879
He was going to buy a boat.

196
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,373
And now we are here.

197
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:10,152
That is made graceful.

198
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,238
Call, Steve,

199
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,360
with you, did funny anything happen?

200
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:19,082
Only we were camping.

201
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:25,590
Let's do in way as if a plan had been
inside this head.

202
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,786
Is that completely what you have?

203
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,719
Listen, this is our food.

204
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,743
No, this would be my breakfast.

205
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:52,551
What is it doing?

206
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,618
It swims.

207
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,891
One of these things bit him.

208
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:02,283
Listen, I - Oh, diabos!

209
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,463
We need it!

210
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:06,594
It is infected.

211
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:07,791
How does he know of that?

212
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,824
I am not going to risk my life.

213
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:11,284
It can go.

214
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,571
We are going to maintain it here.
We will tie it and will observe it.

215
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:15,636
How does one call?

216
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:17,162
For the devil with that.

217
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:18,588
Right. He does not know anything about him.

218
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,241
It even might help.

219
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,603
He might be a scientist!

220
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,361
Listen, we are going
to leave it here this night.

221
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,156
I will undertake to him.

222
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,843
It is better than he is a scientist.

223
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:32,065
It will keep below Thing.

224
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,360
Herbert.

225
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:34,395
It is a thing.

226
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,579
- One calls Herbert.
- Thing!

227
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:38,872
I will not leave Mimi.

228
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:45,642
God!

229
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,801
17 bullets remain for us

230
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,493
and did it shoot for the ceiling?

231
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,189
Done well, Rambo.

232
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,581
I have no problem in using this,
specially when we were infected.

233
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,337
Listen, I feel well.

234
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:58,131
Go for the loft.

235
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,845
Please.

236
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:07,729
Do not make throwing in you, disgraced.

237
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,645
She will be well.

238
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,598
Go.

239
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,432
I present to him the thing,
his companion of room.

240
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,481
He is going to want to eat me.

241
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,133
Yes, well, perhaps you the coma.

242
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,606
That it rests!

243
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,391
Because it does not take away the necklace?

244
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,640
It does not understand me.

245
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,756
He has been eating there.

246
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:02,049
See.

247
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:31,070
What diabos-?

248
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,293
It cannot be.

249
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,399
Give birth!

250
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,256
Does he want to know?

251
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:23,371
It was going to give
this to him for the breakfast.

252
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,752
Let me go out from here!

253
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:34,189
Listen, I have medical training.

254
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,777
My girlfriend is sick
and it needs my help.

255
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,176
Hear, I must keep her.

256
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,068
It needs treatment.

257
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:44,783
Up there, it is his responsibility.

258
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:49,068
He wants to be responsible for the death
of an innocent girl?

259
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,605
Please. Let me go out.

260
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,761
I have no problem in using the weapon.

261
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,192
To purpose,
Lin said that his girlfriend is pregnant.

262
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:22,111
Walk.

263
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,344
Is it pregnant?

264
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:41,665
I do not know. Feel.

265
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,253
I felt it.

266
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:45,413
Feel now.

267
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:54,087
It is already kicking.

268
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,666
Am not I pregnant, yes? It cannot be.

269
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:59,665
I did not do anything. I swear him.

270
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,249
I do not understand.

271
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,215
I yes. You do not want to do this now.

272
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,070
He wants to wait
for when will we be compromised

273
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:07,726
and soon go and it catches other.

274
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:09,657
You would never do that comk.

275
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,185
I love it the rest.

276
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:15,331
Cursed liar.

277
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,874
We had no sex!

278
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:23,203
I am still pure!

279
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,238
Read the signs, people.

280
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,792
The comet?

281
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:37,047
Lift the eyes for the skies

282
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:38,841
and look at the land below;

283
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:41,063
because the skies
they will be undone like smoke

284
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:44,184
and the land will be aged
like clothes of putting on.

285
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:45,720
And in the same way

286
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,607
his residents will perish.

287
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:52,220
Isaías, chapter 51, verse 6.

288
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:58,859
They, them from the outside,
ressucitarão the dead men

289
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:02,048
and these souls will join his bodies.

290
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:06,131
The pregnancy of a virgin
in front of you.

291
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,984
The Antichrist is between us!

292
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:11,949
What stupidity.

293
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,262
This is not the pregnancy of a virgin.

294
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,120
It has at least three months.

295
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:21,080
I was in the Texas three months ago.

296
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:22,305
No!

297
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,201
Be removed of me.

298
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,713
I already do not even know him.

299
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:38,310
I have it. Go.

300
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,701
Calm, dear.

301
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:58,064
We need you there, welded.

302
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:05,243
Well, of acoerdo. But he must eat.

303
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,460
Ok, that is completely.

304
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,114
It is what there is
up to the tomorrow breakfast.

305
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:15,037
He eats.

306
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:17,098
Are you a doctor?

307
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:22,833
In fact I am not a doctor.

308
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,842
I come from a doctors' long line,

309
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:33,458
but it was in the end of this line.

310
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,822
I know the basic thing.

311
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,908
What is happening, Dr. Steve?

312
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,668
I am not a doctor.

313
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:42,324
Ok, nurse Steve,

314
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:45,184
it did not bring him
here in top to the party.

315
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,007
I think what we if discover
since they survive these ghosts,

316
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,068
we will be able averigüar
since in releasing of them.

317
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,889
Do not say to me!

318
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,850
Did you already discover?

319
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,918
Listen, I think what we if will speak

320
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:03,714
on what it happened this night,

321
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:07,237
we might find traces, connections.

322
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:11,749
Because we do not begin with you, Chad?

323
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:13,641
Die!

324
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,501
This might benefit him.

325
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,588
Sometime did he think about that?

326
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,284
Well, I live in a group
to 300 Km. to north from here

327
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:30,778
and it was in the city...

328
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,192
I have been in the world
of the Adult Entertainment for... 20 years.

329
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:37,718
If anybody does not know.

330
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,576
I was at alone home.

331
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,725
On my typical Friday of night.

332
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,544
Fish and a bottle of wine...

333
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:48,701
Well, he liked the idea and-

334
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,660
he wanted to be going to have dinner,

335
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:56,147
still that that was-
we had to retreat some hours.

336
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:58,398
I was and soon...

337
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,362
after the fourth Martini...

338
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:02,390
Something happened.

339
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,373
I like calling O Penis that broke through
the back of the porn star.

340
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,796
It had listened to the news on the peace

341
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,481
and I heard that the President was saying
that we were not worrying.

342
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:15,100
I fainted. We knew what it links-

343
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,755
that the comet was there
four days ago.

344
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:19,019
Great thing.

345
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:20,880
He was telling us not to worry.

346
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:23,566
Soon the sound was made stronger.

347
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:26,063
Bum!

348
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,388
And there was one face.

349
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:29,849
It was running in the street.

350
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:31,774
It was running in the
street and was shouting

351
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:33,235
and these things-

352
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:36,292
these things attacked it in my front

353
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:39,574
and they ate it.

354
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:46,379
And soon I - began to drive

355
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:49,236
and there was a truck
blockading the way

356
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:53,281
and these things were in my turn.

357
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:58,867
And soon I saw this place.

358
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:03,819
Trent?

359
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,240
I have not anything to say.

360
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:08,595
It is so which debit to be.

361
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,209
We cannot do anything to save us
it does not even stop to save the humanity.

362
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:15,102
Please. To help might in.

363
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:18,626
I work for my father in his church.

364
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:21,377
Recruitment,

365
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,466
I direct the local meetings of AA,

366
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,002
this type of things.

367
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,654
Are you afraid?

368
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:28,383
No.

369
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,313
If so God arranges it,

370
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,841
because it came here?

371
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,336
Because it brought his brother?

372
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:37,710
Listen, if we know it
what is happening with these people,

373
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,107
perhaps let's be able
to save them, save Herbert.

374
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,599
So it is how it arranges God!

375
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,920
Is that completely?

376
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:47,675
It did not bring him here to top
why does he say the same stupidity

377
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:50,601
that we are saying all
these last days.

378
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,531
I want to show something them.

379
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,750
What disgust!

380
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:29,648
I already know what it is this.

381
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,366
This went out of inside
of Herbert's pants.

382
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:33,595
It is his.

383
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:36,057
What, does the fez link even?

384
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,515
I do not believe.

385
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,984
I think that this is
part of the transformation

386
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,840
what do these things cross.

387
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:52,158
Ok, already I listened sufficiently
of these medical idiotices.

388
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,780
We should have eaten.

389
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:56,970
So that unless they plan
to gather oysters of ghosts,

390
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,900
this is the plan.

391
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,983
My group is
to a few hours to north from here.

392
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:05,773
I have great food and great grills.

393
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:07,803
What, to maintain someone on the outside?

394
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,987
No, in fact,
to maintain something in the side of inside.

395
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,487
You will see, I-

396
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:15,009
I kept a lion
of one of my movies.

397
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:16,932
It died, but I keep
on having the high grills.

398
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:18,688
I have vegetables, tomatoes,

399
00:29:18,794 --> 00:29:20,187
all that we need.

400
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,900
I need of you two and of you.

401
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:25,333
What?

402
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:27,326
Because it would be
going to want to do that?

403
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:29,907
Well, to you for the reproduction

404
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:34,297
and to you for defense, work,
masculine company.

405
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:36,948
Does he want that he is his slave?

406
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:38,642
No.

407
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,923
My helper in the group.

408
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,489
And we would be his whores.

409
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,945
Well, something so,
but it would give them food.

410
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,939
Take this.

411
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:57,735
I do not need
that none of you delays me.

412
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:58,964
I go away from here.

413
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,878
I think that we should examine Herbert.

414
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:06,070
Who comes?

415
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,975
They will not touch my brother.

416
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,473
D.J., now.

417
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:20,449
I lament, shepherd.

418
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:21,711
We go.

419
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:29,218
What do they think what they are doing?

420
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:31,302
We are going to examine Herbert.

421
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,895
No, they will not do it.

422
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,522
If I must spend one night more here,

423
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,787
you and his enormous lamentation

424
00:30:35,895 --> 00:30:37,445
they will spend the night down with Thing.

425
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:38,913
He is completed.

426
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:40,307
Be silent, bitch!

427
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:41,804
I think that he is right.

428
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,694
I am right, now move!

429
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,953
Move!

430
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,215
No.

431
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:48,110
Quilting stitch!

432
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,696
You will go also,

433
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,528
because the life complicates us?

434
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,318
Move and let us do ours!

435
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:56,541
You also, pastorzinho!

436
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:59,264
Of agreement.

437
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,288
I will spend the night there.

438
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,041
I will go away in the morning.

439
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,265
If be linked, they bring near Thing of me,

440
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:08,765
I will blow up his heads. Understood?

441
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,884
Expert.

442
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,549
No, you use this. I will tie it.

443
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,774
Thank you.

444
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,101
Already! Let's go!

445
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,140
Tie it!

446
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,196
Set it free!

447
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,220
Down! To the ground!

448
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:22,283
- Hold it.
- We go.

449
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,895
Ok, takes away his pants.

450
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:27,155
Steve!
- Lower them boy!

451
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:38,708
- Oh!
- That must hurt.

452
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,870
What is that?

453
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:43,556
It takes. Try with this.

454
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,911
Hold it.

455
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:57,479
Oh, it is a sort of bag or nodule.

456
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:00,364
Move!

457
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:01,430
Oh, for God!

458
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,712
If you are one of these things,
do his testicles fall?

459
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,072
Yes, and the penis.

460
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:08,794
When it identifies human cloth,

461
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:11,221
it is not a virus nor a bacterium
since it is not transmitted by the saliva.

462
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,284
How can he be sure?

463
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:16,430
My uncle - is alcoholic.

464
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:17,997
It drank so much

465
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,718
what him fell a finger of the foot.

466
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:21,252
Bad circulation.

467
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:23,040
Perhaps if the body is cancelled,

468
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:25,162
the genital ones are
the first ones what they if fall

469
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:26,992
when these things
they rot up to dying.

470
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,319
Perhaps.

471
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,712
Perhaps his penis has fallen
because they did not give to him

472
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:33,861
the possibility to defend his cause.

473
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,809
Hold it.

474
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,608
I love you.

475
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:52,229
Please, listen to me.

476
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:57,503
Only I have his word.

477
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:01,155
I can see and feel the proofs
for myself.

478
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:04,650
I do not know what there is...

479
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,540
but it grieves me very much.

480
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,260
Please.

481
00:34:09,368 --> 00:34:10,725
Do not speak with me.

482
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:14,344
I was trusting you...

483
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:20,013
with mine all heart.

484
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:24,970
Steve, please. I specify what helps me.

485
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:29,182
I cannot help him.

486
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:45,581
It can kill it,
so a favor does us to all.

487
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:49,404
It is him who has the weapon.

488
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:54,456
You estrá good, fondness?

489
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:00,661
Is this you-?

490
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,222
David is my pair.

491
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:05,340
We were married eight years.

492
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:10,027
Tare is our 3-year-old girl.

493
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,056
It is divine.

494
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:14,339
Then you and a queer.

495
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,795
We do not like queer here.

496
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:22,079
This falls better in me
of which in you, imbecile.

497
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:24,007
You are the same as me.

498
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,482
The sodomitas are bad and sinners

499
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,144
against Jehovah in the majority.

500
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,573
Genesis, chapter 13, verse 13.

501
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:38,350
I have not to apologize.
It is completely written in the book.

502
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:42,661
The queers if they will proliferate
up to the end of the world,

503
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,193
and they will bring
final justice to the humanity.

504
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:48,678
Lucas, chapter 17, verses 28-30.

505
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:51,169
Does that seem to him known?

506
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:58,464
I have just lost my daughter and my couple.

507
00:35:58,576 --> 00:36:02,458
Oh, they are paying for his sins.

508
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:25,700
I have no problems with that.

509
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:35,494
What does his blood whitewash on us...

510
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,818
and on our children.

511
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:45,121
It is well.

512
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:47,380
I would have done the same thing.

513
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:51,233
Yes, it was continuing insulting me.

514
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,054
I would have cut the arm
one had been gay.

515
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,052
What it is not.

516
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:58,110
Well, I have a son.

517
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:11,886
Listen, old man,

518
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:15,805
I have a place in Florida
for you and my family, yes?

519
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:17,391
In serious.

520
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,151
Listen, I will go away tomorrow.

521
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:21,718
I will return.

522
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,241
I will take a risk.

523
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:27,060
I know that they are alive.

524
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:31,672
Thank you.

525
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:33,762
That means very much for me.

526
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,971
Burn for burn,

527
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,470
injured by wound,

528
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:43,759
blow for blow.

529
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:46,152
Exodus!

530
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,587
TEstá with coldness, fondness?

531
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:55,745
Yes.

532
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,605
Oh, God!

533
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,026
Slasher, might close the door,
please?

534
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,278
Yes, clear.

535
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,404
I, personally, like the breeze.

536
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,895
It makes me feel living creature.

537
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:22,110
However if the girl goes-

538
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,372
Diabos.

539
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:25,699
Shoot in him!

540
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,321
Do something!

541
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:28,485
Shoot in him!

542
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:30,574
I cannot!

543
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:39,172
D.J., do something!

544
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,326
Close the door!

545
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:44,489
Who diabos-?

546
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:47,980
Be well, I make friends!

547
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:50,797
D.J., hurry up!

548
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:52,696
Move!

549
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:16,305
Hear, hear. Calm.

550
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:17,370
It is already. He breathes.

551
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:20,254
Oh, God!

552
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,513
- Ok.
- Calm.

553
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,201
Oh, wanted.

554
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:30,374
I undertake.

555
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,952
What diabos exists there with you?

556
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:44,961
What? Is it going to shoot in me?

557
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,452
He does not know that it is a thing of mentally
handicapped person to point to a weapon for a woman?

558
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,746
And now what?

559
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,571
- We will close the gate.
- I will not go outside.

560
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:02,186
The hero now is afraid!

561
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:03,314
Be dark!

562
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:04,387
You are a viado.

563
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:07,703
The weapon happens.

564
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:10,491
Do not be rude.

565
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:13,778
I do not believe that it has the courage.

566
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:15,434
Do you have it?

567
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:18,926
Simon, is enough!

568
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:20,988
Diabos!

569
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:23,311
It is already sufficient!

570
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:25,633
Chad, we need the weapon.

571
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:29,056
No, Steve, we should
have guarded the bullets.

572
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,914
Why? For an emergence?

573
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:32,500
No, use the carving knife.

574
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:35,995
We will let them pass from one to one
and we will use that.

575
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,647
To let the enemy in here?

576
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:39,377
This is the thing more rude
than I already heard in my life.

577
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:41,738
We should have left and secure the perimeter

578
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:42,895
or we will die here inside!

579
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:44,328
Listen, give us the weapon.

580
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:47,874
Simon will guide us even outside
and we will follow it.

581
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:50,035
Give me the weapon!

582
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:53,029
Of agreement. I will do it.

583
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,215
However not in the night, ok?

584
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:57,045
I do not see well in the night.

585
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,131
There will be much more in the morning!

586
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:00,497
Chad is right.

587
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:03,919
It will be better to try in the morning.

588
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:05,709
Right.

589
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:08,860
That is what he was trying to say to them.

590
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,449
Someone has
a clean T-shirt to lend me?

591
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:14,606
I.

592
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:24,169
Did I lose anything?

593
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:30,973
Hello.

594
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:35,157
It grieves me.

595
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,162
Show off.

596
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,562
Here below.

597
00:41:46,194 --> 00:41:48,118
And here.

598
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,003
And in the neck.

599
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:57,114
There are only the pains of the pregnancy.

600
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:43,424
Like a ninja, eh?

601
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,789
I cannot-

602
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,214
Move! Then move!

603
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:49,641
We are ready, let's go!

604
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:51,329
Steve, covers the sides and the bottom.

605
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:53,229
Open the door.

606
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,657
Do it!

607
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,735
Move.

608
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,878
Hammer.

609
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,531
Let's do this.

610
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,768
Oh, diabos!

611
00:44:51,008 --> 00:44:52,434
Recarregue - to!

612
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:58,478
Very well. I am ready.

613
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:14,814
Brave.

614
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:19,130
They delayed the inevitable
thing for one more day.

615
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:22,243
Listen.

616
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:26,363
It is not worthwhile.

617
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:33,671
Slash! Slash!

618
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,870
Guard a seat for me in the club, friend.

619
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:43,935
Soon I will be with you.

620
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:48,641
What-?

621
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,333
We forget one.

622
00:46:42,443 --> 00:46:43,337
- Promptly?
- Yes.

623
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:44,626
Go.

624
00:46:50,278 --> 00:46:52,893
Wait - ok.

625
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,456
Diabos.

626
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:58,014
Oh, for God!

627
00:46:58,114 --> 00:46:59,007
What?

628
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,129
See that.

629
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:04,949
When it took care with the corners.

630
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:06,945
Yes.

631
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:08,902
Not so far and down.

632
00:47:14,086 --> 00:47:15,839
Nurse Steve?

633
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:19,320
I do not know-

634
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,615
What, it finds that I yes?

635
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,798
Oh, God's mother!

636
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:41,967
Cut it. Let's see what it has inside.

637
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,729
What disgust.

638
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,388
What is?

639
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:59,831
It seems human.

640
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,625
It has three arms.

641
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,842
Cut an arm to see if it feels pain.

642
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:08,762
That is revolting.

643
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:10,333
What, it is playing?

644
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:12,482
It will help us to know
if we can kill this thing.

645
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:32,902
The arm continues moving.

646
00:48:33,012 --> 00:48:36,487
The body
it does not seem to have reacted very much.

647
00:48:40,615 --> 00:48:42,076
Let's see.

648
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,092
Gee, it is cured alone.

649
00:48:49,648 --> 00:48:51,470
A new body is going out.

650
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:56,147
I already see the form
of the fetus developing.

651
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,766
I think what it must do
a complete autopsy in this body.

652
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,791
We have to see it
what more do we can averigüar.

653
00:49:03,892 --> 00:49:06,813
No?

654
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:09,137
No?

655
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,095
Yes.

656
00:49:23,151 --> 00:49:24,938
Care.

657
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:45,590
What is this long vein?

658
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,437
It is tied
to all the principal organs.

659
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:05,312
It rises up to the neck.

660
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,972
We are going to turn it.

661
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:12,484
Hear, it rises up to the head.

662
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,674
Open the head.

663
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:49,211
Shake it.

664
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:04,289
Where is the rest?

665
00:51:06,017 --> 00:51:08,338
Look under the table. Thereabouts.

666
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,427
It is not here.

667
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:13,183
Not here.

668
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:17,109
I adjust what we need.

669
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,677
Perhaps be in the loft.
The door is opened.

670
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:33,305
Some volunteer?

671
00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:36,389
I will go.

672
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:38,253
I also.

673
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,076
To the loft?

674
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,164
Yes.

675
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:47,215
It gives him silver coin.

676
00:51:47,325 --> 00:51:48,841
Always.

677
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:54,495
Diabos!

678
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,145
God!

679
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,097
Please, help me!

680
00:54:27,171 --> 00:54:29,220
Diabos!

681
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:37,096
This thing attacked Simon!
It attacked it!

682
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:38,421
It is big now.

683
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:40,349
It attacked it and I could not do anything.

684
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:41,777
I could not-

685
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,495
Help us, he calls himself
what is the will of God,

686
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:46,322
I will kill him right now!

687
00:54:46,427 --> 00:54:48,148
- I will go.
- No.

688
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:49,874
I will go.

689
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:53,525
It is our end of the same way.

690
00:56:06,218 --> 00:56:07,576
Be quiet.

691
00:56:33,048 --> 00:56:36,760
It was waiting that everything was happening
since God arranged it.

692
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:39,549
I will leave these creatures they pass.

693
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:42,769
The queers are worthy of the death

694
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:47,350
for his sexual antinatural practices,
revolting and depraved.

695
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,811
Levítico, chapter 20, verse 13!

696
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:07,937
The creature killed Simon.

697
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:10,265
For God, it arrived late.

698
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,080
Diabos.

699
00:57:36,402 --> 00:57:38,191
We have not any more water not even eaten.

700
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,382
My girlfriend is pregnant.
The son belongs of another man.

701
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:44,029
Only three bullets remain for us

702
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:45,995
and a world full of human dead men,

703
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:47,783
controlled by creatures in his head,

704
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,935
what, in any way is made a list
with the fall of a comet.

705
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:55,917
Might it be worse?

706
00:57:56,027 --> 00:57:59,344
You also might be castrated.

707
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,889
Well, this is what we have.

708
00:58:03,996 --> 00:58:07,776
It looks that these creatures
there are a sort of parasite,

709
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,921
what does he survive of his hóspedeiro
and it finishes killing it.

710
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,385
Soon it castrates the man

711
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:17,703
and it substitutes his reproductive organs
for his embryo itself.

712
00:58:17,807 --> 00:58:19,290
It seems amusing.

713
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,556
However for what?

714
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,749
They are adapted.

715
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:23,340
They are...

716
00:58:23,452 --> 00:58:25,603
treating of fundirr his DNA with ours

717
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,223
to create a hybrid creature

718
00:58:29,332 --> 00:58:31,120
what can survive
in the atmosphere of the land.

719
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:34,109
It can reproducir-se assexualmente.

720
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:38,127
Then each man-ghost
probably it is to days of incubating.

721
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:40,741
The men cannot go out.
They will take control of the world.

722
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:42,401
And we?

723
00:58:44,006 --> 00:58:46,090
Men.

724
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:53,633
A minute.

725
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:56,521
Mimi, comes here out.

726
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:09,170
Go up to the grill.

727
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:11,662
Why?

728
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:13,915
Only do this.

729
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:21,490
Walk thereabouts.

730
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,437
How does one feel?

731
00:59:27,537 --> 00:59:30,355
Worse.

732
00:59:30,459 --> 00:59:32,112
Come here.

733
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:56,681
Is she one of them, no?

734
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,511
Chad.

735
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:02,296
Diabos!

736
01:00:05,788 --> 01:00:07,646
One stands up.

737
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:15,311
She is one of them. It must die.

738
01:00:15,418 --> 01:00:16,606
He does not know what it is doing.

739
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:18,138
Chad, lowers the weapon!

740
01:00:29,032 --> 01:00:32,079
Shoot in her! Shoot in the cursed one!

741
01:00:32,187 --> 01:00:35,503
Get up!

742
01:00:35,607 --> 01:00:37,564
It can go. We do not need you here.

743
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:39,679
It is committing a great mistake,
I make friends.

744
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:42,439
Yes? We will help it. D.J.

745
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:52,001
You did the correct thing.

746
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:56,487
I return next.

747
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:43,340
Is he you?

748
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:46,658
Yes.

749
01:01:55,064 --> 01:01:57,215
Listen.

750
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:59,280
I feel very much.

751
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:04,022
It never had to doubt of you.

752
01:02:04,129 --> 01:02:06,111
Where am I?

753
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,934
In the loft.

754
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:12,395
In the refuge?

755
01:02:12,498 --> 01:02:14,886
Yes.

756
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:20,625
I think that I fainted
when it pointed to me with the weapon.

757
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:24,807
I am starving.

758
01:02:27,937 --> 01:02:31,186
Really I have
one of these things inside me?

759
01:02:48,722 --> 01:02:50,205
I am a mother.

760
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,958
Cursed ghosts.

761
01:03:01,074 --> 01:03:03,656
Listen, Trent.

762
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:14,350
Let's make love. Now.

763
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:32,748
Perhaps this is his last opportunity...
in the life.

764
01:03:57,487 --> 01:03:58,914
Come here.

765
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,148
Come here.

766
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:29,586
So.

767
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:44,636
Please, Deus, please.

768
01:04:50,782 --> 01:04:53,137
Cursed bitch.

769
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:55,322
What did it do with me?

770
01:04:58,718 --> 01:05:00,438
What did it do with me?

771
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,353
Oh, God!.

772
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:11,196
No! My baby!

773
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,585
For what? For what?

774
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,705
My baby! No!

775
01:06:16,815 --> 01:06:18,739
No!

776
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:24,607
I have it. Are you ready?

777
01:06:28,169 --> 01:06:29,562
I return next.

778
01:06:37,966 --> 01:06:38,859
What?

779
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,441
I think that I already
know what it happened.

780
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:44,007
Everything began with the comet.

781
01:06:45,536 --> 01:06:51,209
These creatures, parasites, were
frozen in the ice of the comet.

782
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:53,997
Possibly unicellular organisms

783
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:55,858
waiting to fall in a planet,

784
01:06:55,962 --> 01:06:58,781
somewhere of the universe
to continue his cycle of life.

785
01:06:58,885 --> 01:07:04,160
To the being released by the impact, it if was distributed
for everyone with the radioactive rain.

786
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:09,698
Any living organism breathed
this replete powder of parasites.

787
01:07:09,808 --> 01:07:11,789
It is like a lonely ringworm.

788
01:07:11,899 --> 01:07:15,252
These parasites do what better they know:

789
01:07:15,355 --> 01:07:18,535
They survive and develop

790
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:20,995
in a bigger scale.

791
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,279
What waste.

792
01:07:32,388 --> 01:07:33,712
These things are going to incubate soon.

793
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:36,271
We should have gone for a safe place!
For a fort.

794
01:07:36,372 --> 01:07:38,558
An impenetrable refuge
naked peak of a mountain, perhaps?

795
01:07:38,664 --> 01:07:40,624
Perhaps, but we need to eat.

796
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:43,700
If to be here, we should
have idealized a system to survive.

797
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:46,958
The autosufficient group of Chad
it can be a good option.

798
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,253
We need provisions right now.

799
01:07:50,384 --> 01:07:54,595
I will go. However I cannot make that alone.

800
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,317
I go with you, girl.

801
01:07:57,425 --> 01:07:59,246
I also.

802
01:08:03,102 --> 01:08:04,156
Dispose of me.

803
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:07,616
No. You stay here
and take care of his girlfriend.

804
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:09,472
And we need someone in the entry.

805
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:17,803
Kylie, can I tell him a thing?

806
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,495
Clear, my love.

807
01:08:19,604 --> 01:08:23,249
I respect you very much.

808
01:08:24,553 --> 01:08:27,167
Thank you.

809
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:35,368
- Let's do then.
- Yes.

810
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,989
We go.

811
01:08:42,249 --> 01:08:45,431
We go. Move!

812
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:49,709
- Diabos.
- Follow in front!

813
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:51,304
- The gate!
- Let's go!

814
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:54,898
Oh, God!

815
01:08:57,093 --> 01:08:58,711
Mimi, bring the weapon!

816
01:09:03,733 --> 01:09:05,091
No! Wait, Kylie!

817
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:11,433
Go out from here! Go!

818
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,290
What is that?

819
01:10:05,393 --> 01:10:07,713
It seems a shot.

820
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,563
She is Lin.

821
01:10:13,496 --> 01:10:14,888
Be here.

822
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:21,619
Oh, God!.

823
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:23,021
What does he want?

824
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:25,445
A second opportunity.

825
01:10:25,549 --> 01:10:28,005
What did he say?

826
01:10:29,865 --> 01:10:31,415
Listen, Steve,

827
01:10:31,526 --> 01:10:33,847
there is nothing any more
outside of what you buzz.

828
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:35,806
You saved me the life. I must respect that.

829
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:38,590
And like or not, we are joined in this.

830
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:39,750
Because I do not trust you?

831
01:10:41,785 --> 01:10:43,405
Very well.

832
01:10:43,513 --> 01:10:46,728
From now on, all we will have arms.

833
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,938
Let me pass.

834
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:56,291
Open the jacket and go round.

835
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:08,014
One does not make repenting of this.

836
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:19,198
Oh, chocolate.

837
01:11:19,306 --> 01:11:21,922
I have great-
I have great canned food.

838
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:25,177
Tengo seeds, music, creators,

839
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:29,166
cool fruit drinks, books, plays, liqueur.

840
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:33,616
I have even... this.

841
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,230
We go, Steve, it is my group.

842
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:40,154
I...

843
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:44,041
I need of companhía.

844
01:11:45,604 --> 01:11:49,023
I need help. It is a very big place.

845
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,481
Only Mimi and I remain here.

846
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:54,502
Diabos.

847
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,218
Ok, do you want to begin a community?

848
01:11:57,326 --> 01:12:00,902
Or it is ready to catch a dwarf,
or it is ready to do to him his friend.

849
01:12:01,011 --> 01:12:03,694
This is one of my lines of-

850
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:05,453
Quadruple risk.

851
01:12:05,559 --> 01:12:09,239
Perhaps know some of his works.

852
01:12:09,346 --> 01:12:12,425
Do not call.

853
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:13,585
How is she?

854
01:13:13,695 --> 01:13:17,873
Lin wants to operate
it if it manages to return.

855
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:20,095
I wait that yes.

856
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:22,094
And not to return?

857
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:24,210
It might have brought the good.

858
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:29,031
I went to all the shops of the city,
the city is completely flooded.

859
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:30,823
It was that or the illicit local liqueur.

860
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:32,854
In the end, the majority is so.

861
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:35,104
Besides more, of everything necessary
to prepare ours.

862
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:37,068
Yes!

863
01:13:37,171 --> 01:13:38,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

864
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:40,250
Illicit liqueur!

865
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,756
Listen, Steve.

866
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:50,342
I even have a bag of calçinhas.
What look to him?

867
01:13:50,453 --> 01:13:52,140
No?

868
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:04,455
No! No!

869
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,456
Do something!

870
01:14:06,557 --> 01:14:07,610
Please!

871
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,362
Steve, I have soporiferous drugs.

872
01:14:34,614 --> 01:14:36,867
No, not - Am I Chad, yes?

873
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,523
I am Chad.

874
01:14:54,405 --> 01:14:55,729
Now see!

875
01:14:56,795 --> 01:14:59,343
Wait, hear, hear.

876
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,791
Take away this thing of inside me.

877
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:02,534
When Mimi was wanted,

878
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,790
I know that what I am to do

879
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:09,245
probably cost to me the life,
but I do not mind.

880
01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:12,425
To see you suffering
is worse than the death itself.

881
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,646
I love you and want that he keeps on living-

882
01:16:15,755 --> 01:16:18,111
not only for me,
but for the good of the humanity.

883
01:16:18,212 --> 01:16:20,794
You amaré forever.

884
01:16:22,031 --> 01:16:23,547
Steve.

885
01:18:03,537 --> 01:18:05,517
I love you.

886
01:18:49,027 --> 01:18:51,347
It is the alcohol.

887
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:53,205
They do not like the alcohol.

888
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,843
They do not like the alcohol, wanted.

889
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:10,500
All drunks were when it fell.

890
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:15,024
I had taken champagne
in the night that the comet fell.

891
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,547
They do not like the alcohol in the blood.

892
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:20,297
I am going to take him from here.

893
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:53,806
Take this.

894
01:19:53,908 --> 01:19:55,063
Antibiotics.

895
01:20:13,332 --> 01:20:14,884
A minute.

896
01:21:39,864 --> 01:21:41,413
We should have gone to a group of Chad,

897
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:43,572
to secure it, to sow corn,
trees of apple,

898
01:21:43,682 --> 01:21:45,934
what does he want
that it has in the camionete.

899
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,717
And we should have
put a ring in his finger...

900
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,877
it as early as possible.

901
01:21:52,349 --> 01:21:53,367
What does it mean?

902
01:22:18,049 --> 01:22:19,033
Would you get married with me?

903
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:22,096
Yes, clear.

904
01:22:33,854 --> 01:22:35,178
For the happy couple.

905
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:38,766
Take, drink this.

906
01:22:38,868 --> 01:22:39,988
It is well.

907
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,670
Yes, I know. It is awful.

908
01:23:07,655 --> 01:23:09,580
Ok, there has one. Shoot in this.

909
01:23:09,682 --> 01:23:11,140
Wait. Take.

910
01:23:12,471 --> 01:23:13,557
Diabos.

911
01:23:24,323 --> 01:23:25,908
Come, we go.

912
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:50,015
Listen, we go.

913
01:23:50,016 --> 01:23:59,999
