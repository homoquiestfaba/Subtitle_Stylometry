1
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,377
You promise?

2
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,310
I promise.

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,220
<i>Nyet!</i>

4
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,163
- You promise?
- I promise.

5
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,034
I promise.

6
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,550
You promise?

7
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,245
I promise.

8
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,812
- You promise?
- I promise.

9
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,660
Yeah, three dead bodies.

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,427
At least two suspects
fleeing the scene.

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,367
It was Eli who called it in.
He heard gunshots.

12
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,166
Mmm.

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,435
Yeah, his farm's right next door
to that old warehouse.

14
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,999
Yeah.
We got to the scene right away.

15
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,945
No no, she hasn't talked yet.

16
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,361
Your name is...

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,802
"Maja Latin..."

18
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:50,002
- "La..."
- Maya Letinskaya.

19
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,812
- Here are the files.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,586
Why are you in America?

21
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,382
I came for Nina.

22
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,650
What do you do for a living?

23
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,988
I am a swan.

24
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,996
I'm gonna take this call

25
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,522
and when I get back, I don't wanna hear
any shit about birds, you got it?

26
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,035
Excuse me.

27
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,268
Yeah.

28
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,173
He wants to come over here?

29
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,041
I am a swan.

30
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,546
In an hour?
Well, that's fast.

31
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,106
I was a swan.

32
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,360
Ah, we're screwed!

33
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,625
Totally late.

34
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,462
Sasha, isn't there anything you can do?

35
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,297
It's hopeless, boss.

36
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,135
You know they say Russia is a country
of drunks, fools and bad roads.

37
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,767
Your country is a land
of opportunity, Sasha.

38
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,776
Anything is possible here.

39
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,411
She is so elegant and beautiful.

40
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,285
She is only there because
of her rich husband.

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,085
Maya was always the best dancer.

42
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,027
Long before she met Mr. Mason.

43
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,177
Hello, who's this?

44
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,521
It would be such a shame
if you were late

45
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,187
on the night your pretty wife
becomes a swan.

46
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,390
Who is this?
How'd you get this number?

47
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,162
I am only taking back
what you stole from Russia.

48
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,669
I stole nothing.

49
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,707
You have raped
our natural resources,

50
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,901
sucking our oil fields dry,

51
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,208
and taking the very best of our women
for your own wife, blyad.

52
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,249
I've got nothing to say to you.

53
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,479
If you want to find
what's at the end of this line,

54
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,282
follow the missing money.

55
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,084
What missing money?

56
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,393
Do you want me
to get rid of him, boss?

57
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,901
He fought for your country, Sasha.

58
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,234
It's not his fault it took more
than he had to give.

59
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,509
Mommy, Mommy!
Look out behind you!

60
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,557
See you later.

61
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,727
Yes?

62
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,202
Mr. Mason, it's Usov.

63
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,239
Usov, I'm headed into the theater.

64
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,901
Um, I just got a call from our partners

65
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,968
and they haven't received
any payment yet from our oil refinery.

66
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,378
Well, the bank credit
was granted two weeks ago.

67
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,678
I know.
The contract has penalty clauses

68
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,312
and if we don't pay it now, we could
lose tens of millions of dollars.

69
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,618
Okay, I hear you.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

70
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,157
- Good evening, Mr. Mason.
- Hi.

71
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,929
- Nina.
- Hi.

72
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,295
- Shh. You're late.
- I know, I know.

73
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,803
I got stuck in traffic.

74
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,473
Look at your mom.
She's gorgeous.

75
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,977
That's fast, huh?

76
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,447
Nina, Nina, it is time.

77
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,721
Good luck.

78
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,199
- Enjoy. Okay.
- I'll talk to you soon.

79
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,402
Hello, ladies.

80
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,514
I'll see you inside.

81
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,675
- Roman! Hey.
- How are you, sir?

82
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,377
Excuse me.
Did you enjoy the show?

83
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,851
Maya was amazing, as always.

84
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,720
Well, I'll tell you,
it was a wonderful introduction.

85
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,315
To the greatest thing
you've ever done.

86
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,690
Except for make you rich, right?

87
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,924
Michael, let me talk to you for a
second.

88
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,829
Somebody's buying up our debts.

89
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,891
- What? Who?
- I don't know yet.

90
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,903
But they're using front companies.

91
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,836
Those bonds are secured
against our shares,

92
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,204
and if we don't pay on time
we could lose a lot of money.

93
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,985
Bravo!

94
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,086
By the way, uh,

95
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,495
have you heard anything
from our oil refinery?

96
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,931
No.

97
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,595
Well, they...
they received the bank credit,

98
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,331
but they're delaying payment.

99
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,238
- What?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,469
All right, I'll go up there tomorrow.
I'll take care of it.

101
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,239
I'll handle it myself.

102
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,506
- You sure?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,779
- Now you are our swan.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,753
- Yes, oh!
- Daddy, Daddy!

105
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,413
- Sweetie!
- Daddy, Daddy!

106
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,958
Oh God, you're gorgeous.

107
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,392
Isn't your mommy amazing?
Gorgeous!

108
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,655
Gorgeous gorgeous!

109
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,697
Ah, now here's a man,

110
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,895
you definitely must meet.

111
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,632
A good friend of mine,
Richard Valentine.

112
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,537
Richard is very busy

113
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,771
turning Moscow into a giant casino.

114
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,573
I love you.

115
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,341
Richard, please behave yourself.

116
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,976
- I'm reinventing Russia in Sin City...
- Excuse me.

117
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,215
...in an empty lot
between Paris, Venice,

118
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,121
New York and the Pyramids.

119
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,819
And I'm gonna kidnap you
and I'm gonna make you a star.

120
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,488
You'd still be a swan

121
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,659
in a mystical lake
over there in the neon sands.

122
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,463
Come and dance
in America, Maya.

123
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,505
Why would I need your fake
when I have this theater for real?

124
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,541
All right. Who's this?

125
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,668
- There you are!
- Oh honey.

126
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,974
Oh God.
You were spectacular.

127
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,980
- Thank you.
- I see our show as

128
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,709
Tchaikovsky meets "Pretty Woman."

129
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,752
Listen, we're going to have
Zhivago-style snow storms.

130
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,846
A... uh... it's kind of...
she's a pole-dancing waif

131
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,652
in a swan suit that she discards

132
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,252
feather by feather until
he comes along... the man she loves.

133
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:33,196
- Sounds kinda tired to me.
- Oh, I get it. Wait a minute.

134
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,894
How much for your trophy wife, pal?

135
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,733
- One, two, three...
- Oh ho ho.

136
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,774
One, two, three, four...

137
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,039
- What are we talking about?
- She's not for sale.

138
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,104
Come on.

139
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,150
Everyone's for sale.
We're just negotiating a price here.

140
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,152
How much?

141
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,287
Hey, Dick! Ha ha ha!
How are you, man?

142
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,885
- Hey hey hey!
- It's good to see you!

143
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,022
- Mikey!
- You still wearing that $10,000 watch,

144
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,929
- you Cartier commie?
- Oh yeah!

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,730
Still plundering the wild wild East, eh?
You casino capitalist.

146
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,600
Say hello to my daughter, huh?

147
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,199
Hello! An innocent...
from your loins?

148
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,867
Wow.

149
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,037
This... show...

150
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,844
business.

151
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,910
- Huh? Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good, huh?

152
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,149
Wait, whoop, what's that?

153
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,624
Look at that.
Don't spend it all in one place now.

154
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,889
You know that Richard
is a strange guy.

155
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,830
Yeah, he is a little strange.

156
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,671
But we grew up together,
used to chase the same girls,

157
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,073
all that nonsense.

158
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:56,114
He called me, wanted me
to take a stake in his new casino,

159
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,117
but I kinda feel
like one Russia is plenty.

160
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:04,054
But for all his antics,
Richard is someone we can trust.

161
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:08,822
Should anything ever happen
to me, I want you to know that.

162
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,486
Okay?

163
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,642
Darling, I've gotta go
to the oil refinery tomorrow.

164
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,770
Something is not right.

165
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,272
If you have any problems,
just call Roman as usual, okay?

166
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,546
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,795
Oh, I just had a fantastic idea.

168
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,824
Why don't we go for a little boat ride,
just the two of us?

169
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,235
I mean, White Nights
only come once a year, yeah?

170
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,069
Sasha will be more than happy
to take our little angel home.

171
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,843
Won't you, Sasha?

172
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,153
Step to the little boat.

173
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,199
It's nice.
We'll take a nice little trip.

174
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,325
Thank you.

175
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,268
Okay.
Thank you, man.

176
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,092
Are you okay?

177
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,328
Yeah yeah.
Everything is...

178
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,963
it's perfect.
Don't worry.

179
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,531
But of course I worry.
You seem distracted.

180
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,448
Sometimes I feel scared

181
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,451
that I've been too lucky

182
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,955
and all this happiness
is just a dream.

183
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,686
Don't imagine things.

184
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,098
I'll keep you safe.

185
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,191
Now, then,

186
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,237
always and forever.

187
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,114
That's a pretty picture of you.

188
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,984
Where did you get that?

189
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,456
I may be a small-town sheriff,

190
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,050
but I know how to use the Internet.

191
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,655
We've been contacted
by the Russian State Department.

192
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,995
We're expecting
an agent within the hour.

193
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,331
Does that worry you?

194
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,602
Because if deportation worries you,

195
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,236
you have about an hour
to convince me

196
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,213
- not to hand you over.
- I'm cooperating.

197
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,912
You said your husband
was in the oil-refinery industry.

198
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,817
He must have been away
a lot on business.

199
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,322
All the time.

200
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,425
But I have my darling Nina.
She's everything to me.

201
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,724
Why do we bake cookies?
You never eat them anyways.

202
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,131
I bake them for Daddy.
And for you.

203
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,568
- Don't you like cookies?
- No, I love cookies.

204
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,196
But...

205
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,571
but if I eat as many as you do,

206
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,543
I won't be allowed
to dance in the theater.

207
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,570
What else do you have to do
to be a dancer?

208
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,948
You have to practice
every day, eat little,

209
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,953
and work a lot.

210
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:33,617
Why did you pick ballet
if you can't eat cookies?

211
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,092
Oh, because I had to.

212
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,698
When I was eight,

213
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,602
my mom got very sick

214
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,007
and she couldn't take care of me.

215
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,045
That's why I went
to a ballet academy.

216
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:00,244
I remember she said,
"If you dance really well,

217
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,753
the academy will take care of you."

218
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,652
And I promised I would.

219
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,575
Our teachers were strict.

220
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,203
But I had to take it for my mom's sake.

221
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,514
Mamochka?

222
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,179
When she died,

223
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,745
I had no one left but ballet...

224
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,059
and my promise.

225
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,262
Mamochka?

226
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,854
Mama!

227
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,159
So I jumped like a grasshopper

228
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,637
and walked on my tippy toes

229
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,903
and watched everyone else
eat their cookies.

230
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,995
You remember

231
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,400
what this oil refinery
was like when I bought it?

232
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,995
Like a tomb.
And now look.

233
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,474
So tell me, why don't you want
to modernize the plant now?

234
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,568
Of course I do.

235
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,513
Then why do you imagine that
the Americans will give you technology

236
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:15,076
- when you haven't paid them?
- What? Not pay?

237
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,089
I think maybe

238
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,886
you do not understand.

239
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:24,691
The bank credit was not granted
to the refinery itself.

240
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,699
We only offered our assets

241
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,701
as security.

242
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,135
Half a billion dollars
is a lot of money.

243
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,469
It doesn't just vanish
into thin air.

244
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,771
The bank credit was received

245
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,869
by an offshore company.

246
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,971
What?

247
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,484
Please call your own office.

248
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,487
They handle all the contracts.

249
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,723
Hi.
What are you doing here?

250
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,129
I thought I'd wait for you,
like the old days.

251
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,468
How are you, beautiful?

252
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,813
How did two Americans end up
in the Russian oil business?

253
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,251
When the Soviet Union collapsed,

254
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,256
all the rules went out the window.

255
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,623
If you had a little bit of money
and you were daring,

256
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,753
you could make millions
really quickly.

257
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,195
And Michael took a chance
at the right time.

258
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,130
But it's dangerous too.

259
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,328
Russian mafia is everywhere.

260
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,144
- Hello?
- Mr. Mason?

261
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,775
It's me, Usov.

262
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,786
We're... we don't have
a great signal here.

263
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,322
- I can't hear you.
- It's Usov.

264
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,484
Why aren't you calling me
from your usual company number?

265
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,152
I'm worried about my safety.

266
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:07,426
Some money has suddenly
appeared in the bank account

267
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,330
of one of your offshore companies.

268
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,700
A lot of money.

269
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,136
So you suspect someone is

270
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,265
siphoning off money
from our main business.

271
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,775
The company's controlled
by bearer shares.

272
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,507
Whoever holds
the company's shares has the money.

273
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,014
Per your instructions,

274
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:28,212
I've instituted confidential
emergency protocol Nikita.

275
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,414
There's still time
to access these shares.

276
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,356
- Whoever did this...
- Usov?

277
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,858
Usov?!

278
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,265
Protocol Nikita.

279
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,602
Mr. Mason,
what can we do for you?

280
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,642
Hello, I'd like to order some flowers...

281
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,404
for my wife.

282
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,334
Miss Maya Letinskaya?

283
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,213
Going up?

284
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,776
Top floor.

285
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,324
- Hello, it's Usov.
- Hello, it's Usov.

286
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,364
- Hello?
- Hello?

287
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,008
Mommy, Mommy!

288
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,073
- Hey.
- Mommy!

289
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,251
How come you're not sleeping?

290
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,380
I had a nightmare about daddy.

291
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,721
Come on.

292
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,311
Hello? Usov?

293
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,015
Usov is lying in a pool
of his own blood.

294
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,149
Don't worry, Michael.

295
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,785
You will soon be joining him.

296
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:45,099
I will make sure you leave
Maya and little Nina penniless.

297
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,517
- Do you hear that sound, Michael?
- What's going on?

298
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,888
I asked you before to find
the end of the line.

299
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,254
It is the end of the line, Michael.

300
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,322
Sasha, get us out of here.

301
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,463
Sasha?!

302
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,773
What the hell are you doing?!

303
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,537
Don't kill him!

304
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,708
Your concern for your men is touching.

305
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,599
But you should rather
worry about yourself,

306
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,316
sitting inside a bomb on wheels.

307
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:39,127
Listen.
Listen to me.

308
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,131
Oh, Jesus Christ.

309
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,793
Listen, let's... let's meet.
Let's talk, all right?

310
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,428
Let's... let's talk about this!

311
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,768
I have a wife.
I have a family.

312
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,637
You don't need to do this.

313
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,974
I want your last thought
to be of Nina growing up an orphan

314
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:58,880
while your pretty wife is
stabbed to death in prison.

315
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,248
Bye-bye, Mikhail.

316
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,310
Hello?

317
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,462
I'm so sorry.

318
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,560
What's wrong, Maya?
Is everything okay?

319
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,071
I don't know, I just...
this stupid dream last night.

320
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,437
- Get 'em out of here now.
- Let's just do it again.

321
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,975
- Okay, yeah.
- Excuse me, people.

322
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,535
Can everybody leave, please?

323
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,807
Now.

324
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,750
Maya.

325
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,297
I'm sorry to tell you this, Maya.

326
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,993
Michael is dead.

327
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,834
A generous friend,
a selfless humanitarian,

328
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,669
a devoted father
and a beloved husband...

329
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,802
In sure and certain hope
of resurrection into eternal life

330
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,076
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

331
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,917
we commend to Almighty Lord God
our brother Michael Mason.

332
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,923
And the Lord said unto Adam,

333
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,858
"In the sweat of thy face
shall thou eat thy bread,"

334
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,088
till thou return unto the ground;

335
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,495
for out of it thou was taken:

336
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:04,228
for dust thou art,
and unto dust shall thou return."

337
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,807
Maya, I'll find out who did this.

338
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,817
Please do.

339
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,614
I promise.

340
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,222
Usov is dead.

341
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,660
- Murdered.
- What?

342
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,698
Yeah, they found
his body this morning.

343
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,357
What's going on?

344
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,995
There's some money missing.
A lot of money.

345
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,562
Did Michael ever mention
anything to you

346
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,164
about documents
or anything like that?

347
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,436
No, Michael never
brought business home.

348
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,500
Hmm.

349
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,348
Maya, let me see if I can
explain this to you.

350
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,282
They're the bearer shares
of an offshore account

351
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,287
controlled by a blind trust,
and they're missing.

352
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,189
Those shares are like cash.

353
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,784
A half a billion dollars in cash.

354
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,823
I've lost control of the oil refinery.

355
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,142
The banks...

356
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,769
have frozen all your assets.

357
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:03,343
You could lose this home.
You could lose everything.

358
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,317
I have no idea,
but I'll look everywhere.

359
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,827
Okay.

360
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,597
Let me know.

361
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,894
Mamochka?

362
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,102
Nina, please, let's not
stop speaking English.

363
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,040
What will happen to me
if you leave like Daddy?

364
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,248
Nina, I will never leave you.

365
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,359
You promise?

366
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,726
Of course I promise.

367
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:29,036
Let's go to the theater, hmm?

368
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,786
Hello, Nina.
Maya, can you give me a lift?

369
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,486
My mama is sick.

370
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,395
Yeah, I'll take you.
Do you want to come?

371
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,797
Can I go and play?

372
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,335
Yes, but don't disturb anybody.

373
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,337
And don't go outside
the theater, okay?

374
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,838
Okay.

375
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,473
What a nice dress.

376
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,584
Did I do something wrong?

377
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,019
That's for you to confess
and us to find out.

378
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,580
You have the wrong person.

379
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,617
You are Maya Letinskaya.

380
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,258
You can call your
husband's friends later.

381
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,168
I'm seizing your phone
as evidence.

382
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,233
Cocaine.

383
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,707
How original.

384
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,210
I don't know how it got there.

385
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,405
Get in our car.

386
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,915
I can't go.
My daughter is at the theater.

387
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,111
How convenient.
That's where we're going.

388
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,260
Are you lost?

389
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,998
That's right, I'm lost,

390
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,596
and I have lost something too.

391
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,504
Will you help me find it?

392
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,169
- What is it?
- Some papers

393
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,976
that are worth a lot
of money, just like you.

394
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,415
Hey!

395
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,815
Hey!

396
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,755
So drug possession is
part of this rap sheet.

397
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,356
I was set up. The drugs in the car
and the dressing room were planted.

398
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,026
What's going on?

399
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,935
- Nina!
- Mom!

400
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,735
Richard is someone we can trust.

401
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,742
I want you to know that.

402
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,402
Okay?

403
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,005
- Richard! Richard!
- Mom!

404
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,947
- Take her to Michael's parents!
- I will.

405
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,042
- She will be safe there.
- I'll look after her.

406
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,349
Baby, I love you!

407
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,542
You gave your daughter
to an almost complete stranger.

408
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,388
Someone killed Michael
and now they got to me.

409
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,054
I had no choice.
If Richard could take her to Las Vegas

410
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,563
to Michael's parents,
she would be safe there.

411
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,429
I had to take Nina out of Russia.

412
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,003
Then what happened?

413
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,408
Things got worse.

414
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,025
Put your jewelry in here.

415
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,180
One minute.

416
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,454
- Hello?
- Roman?

417
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,287
- Maya.
- Where is Nina? Is she okay?

418
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,260
She's on a plane with Richard
right now to America.

419
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,762
They took off so quickly

420
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,661
I didn't even get a chance
to see them off.

421
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,895
Maya, I hope you know what you're doing
trusting Nina with this guy.

422
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,062
Maya?

423
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,470
Roman, get me out
of this prison, please.

424
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,633
- Maya, it's not that easy.
- But I've been set up!

425
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,269
- I didn't do anything!
- I... I know. Just listen to me.

426
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,642
The police are at your house right now.

427
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,193
They claim they're looking for drugs,

428
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,876
but I think they're looking
for those documents.

429
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,612
But I've looked everywhere.
I don't know where they are.

430
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,360
Maya?

431
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,683
Too good for our food?

432
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,548
What's your name?

433
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,649
Maya.

434
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,919
Welcome to our little world.

435
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,984
Though you don't look like you like it.

436
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,757
There is no man to protect you here.

437
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,559
What do you do?

438
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,599
I'm a dancer.

439
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,628
Marsha here was a whore too.

440
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,466
What are you in for?

441
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,338
Cocaine.

442
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,676
That's seven years.

443
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,715
But I'm innocent.

444
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,784
I'm innocent.

445
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,150
I'm innocent too.

446
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,054
In here we're all innocent
but proven guilty.

447
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,991
And guilty until proven rich.

448
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,290
The question
you should be asking is...

449
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,264
...who benefits by setting you up.

450
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,428
We searched
all the ballerina's assets.

451
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,834
I'm not lifting another finger
for some imaginary reward.

452
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,929
I need compensation now.

453
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:55,058
You don't say much
but you're well funded.

454
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,491
Get out of my house.

455
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,427
Look for the papers.

456
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,070
Hello, little girl.

457
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,150
Ah! Nyet!

458
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,371
What is it?

459
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,433
Bad news from America.

460
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,347
What is it?

461
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:37,046
Maya, Nina has been kidnapped.

462
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,450
I'm sorry.

463
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,960
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- God!

464
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:54,904
Hey hey hey!

465
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,237
Please no! Not Nina!

466
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,539
Oh God!

467
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,776
Nina, I will never leave you.

468
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,555
You promise?

469
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,961
You promise?

470
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,496
I promise.

471
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,427
You promise?

472
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,731
I promise.

473
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,132
When I grow up,

474
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,641
- I wanna be a ballerina.
- Nina...

475
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,270
Just like you, Mommy.

476
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:13,009
It's your favorite thing in the world.

477
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,415
It's not my favorite.

478
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,477
You are.

479
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,683
I promise I will find you.

480
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,427
I will get out of here somehow.

481
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,157
Even if I have to break out
of this prison,

482
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,202
I will find you.

483
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,569
And I will get you back.

484
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,131
I promise.

485
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,076
- You promise?
- I promise.

486
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,278
Get up!

487
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,967
The ring.

488
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,900
Give it to me.

489
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,093
I ask you,
where are those papers?

490
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,141
Search them!

491
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:38,699
Contraband.

492
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,740
You're the ballerina.

493
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,944
You were told jewelry
is forbidden in here.

494
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,815
Now you know why.

495
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,854
Back to the isolation cell.

496
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,014
She can practice her dance there.

497
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,856
Don't be stupid.

498
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,951
It must look like suicide.

499
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,742
The boss is not gonna like this.

500
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,335
I don't care.

501
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,381
The bitch made me bleed.

502
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,853
That's her coffin.

503
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,879
Medic!

504
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,565
Turn down that racket.

505
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,862
Is it the monitor or the whore?

506
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,368
I think it's the whore.

507
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,235
So do something about it!

508
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,347
Watch how you're driving!

509
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,581
Mommy, wake up.

510
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,412
Wake up.
Don't die, Mommy.

511
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,781
Mommy!

512
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,532
I love you, Mommy.

513
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,121
You totally fell on your ass.

514
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,679
Fell on my ass?!

515
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,156
I was trying to remove the bra.

516
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,658
You should have done that yourself.

517
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,126
The boy is shy.

518
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:01,524
Right.

519
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,761
He's never seen
a naked woman before.

520
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,803
Are you saying I'm a faggot?!

521
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,532
Only a homo would not
take advantage.

522
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,132
Usually these whores are ugly.

523
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,345
I'll do her right now!

524
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,213
Yeah, show us your dick!

525
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,528
That's right,
get your dick inside here!

526
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,141
Leave some for me!

527
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:09,092
Did he finish?
It's my turn now!

528
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:13,933
Dream on.

529
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,151
- Hello?
- Roman?

530
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,816
Maya, is that you?

531
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:45,724
Maya?

532
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,457
Maya?

533
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:54,593
Because the police
were searching for me,

534
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,501
Roman took me to a safe place.

535
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,506
Roman sounds like a good friend.

536
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,134
I knew Roman before I met Michael.

537
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,203
What exactly does that mean?

538
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:09,081
Whatever it was,
it was a long time ago.

539
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,456
It felt like weeks passed,

540
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:18,153
but later I realized
it was only a few days.

541
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:25,067
Now when I needed him,
Roman saved my life.

542
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,658
Nina.

543
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,946
Maya.

544
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,384
Shh, it's okay.

545
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,422
We contacted Richard Valentine
in Las Vegas.

546
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,651
He promised to help me
search for Nina.

547
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,488
Richard's gonna help you find Nina.

548
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,997
Then Roman went back to the city
so it didn't look so suspicious.

549
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,827
He said the police were watching him.

550
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,867
I'll see you in a couple days.

551
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,535
Staring down that clock
is not going to stop

552
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,837
the Russians from
taking custody of you.

553
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:12,241
So you haven't found the papers.

554
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:20,282
I was so sure
Michael had sent me a message.

555
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,881
I just didn't know how.

556
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,928
It had to be somewhere.

557
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,431
It had to be.

558
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:14,632
All dancers to the stage.
All dancers to the stage.

559
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:27,122
Maya, can you give me a lift?
My mama is sick.

560
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,685
Cocaine.

561
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,663
Katya, if you're gonna
be prima ballerina...

562
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,893
get your ass to the stage.

563
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,370
God damn rush.

564
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,111
There's no toilet paper!

565
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,915
Katya, how nice of you
to finally join us.

566
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,792
I would replace you in a second.

567
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,906
"To my lovely swan,

568
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,316
Ladozhsky train station,
St. Petersburg,

569
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,617
clock chamber 35C.

570
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,283
The code is Nina's birthday.

571
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,848
Tell no one.

572
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:15,523
I love you now, then,

573
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,362
always, forever."

574
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:03,959
Hello?

575
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,625
Maya.
Hey, it's Roman.

576
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,499
- How're you doing? Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

577
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,335
Good good.
I was just worried about you.

578
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,270
Wrong place, idiots.

579
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,245
Hey!

580
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,677
Go next door.

581
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,299
Give it to me!

582
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,243
Shit! Hello?

583
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:38,616
- Maya?
- Richard!

584
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,450
I have that flight for you.

585
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,888
The ticket is waiting for you
at the check-in counter.

586
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:47,557
I'll pick you up when you get here.

587
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,462
If you're a fugitive,
how did you get out of the country?

588
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,523
It's Russia, not the Soviet Union.

589
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,430
I flew through Latvia.

590
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:59,565
It took longer,
but I made it through.

591
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,575
Where are the bonds now?

592
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,745
All right then, let's talk about
this guy... Richard Valentine.

593
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,114
We can't get a hold of him
to corroborate your story.

594
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,153
His office doesn't
know where he is.

595
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,951
A guy like Valentine
doesn't just disappear.

596
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,821
I came to Las Vegas
so he can help me find Nina.

597
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,191
When I first met him,
I thought he was strange,

598
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,162
but Michael said I could trust him.

599
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,742
Hi.

600
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,283
Thank you.

601
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:31,219
Where are we?

602
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,922
Where are we?

603
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,916
This is Richard Valentine.
Please leave me a message.

604
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,893
And viva Las Vegas.

605
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,451
Where is Richard?

606
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,856
I put him down in the desert.

607
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,453
- Nina?!
- Mama!

608
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,236
Watch out.

609
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,839
She can kick behind her own head.

610
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,665
Use the silencer.

611
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,206
Are we going to die now?

612
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:11,616
No, sweetie.
We're not going to die.

613
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,518
Only bad guys gonna die.

614
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,982
Can you really kick behind your head?

615
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,117
I told you to use the silencer.

616
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,919
Mama!

617
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:27,758
You came back for me.

618
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:29,524
Of course I came back for you.

619
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,998
I promised I would.

620
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,859
Well, that's quite a story
you've got there.

621
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:02,522
But there's one thing
you haven't told me that I have to know.

622
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:06,125
Where are the bonds?

623
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,171
I have them.

624
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,775
Does that mean you're
not going to hand me over?

625
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:21,282
That must be
the Russian-embassy guy now.

626
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:38,130
This doesn't mean
that I'm going to let you go.

627
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,497
Thank you.

628
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,196
It just means that I trust
you're not gonna run out on me.

629
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,032
Mama, Mama.

630
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:48,701
The man from the theater
is lost again.

631
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:54,307
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

632
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:57,647
- How did you know I was a fugitive?
- I didn't.

633
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,779
The Russian Consulate contacted me.

634
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,848
Please don't tell them
about the documents.

635
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,051
Why?

636
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,957
Because if they're really
from the embassy,

637
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,859
they would not know about them.

638
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,397
You trust me, don't you?

639
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:19,269
Sheriff.
Ivanko, Russian State Department.

640
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:20,933
Jim Nash, glad to meet you.

641
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,806
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,

642
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,574
but we're gonna have to keep
Miss Letinskaya here

643
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,638
pending our homicide investigation.

644
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,843
I understand.

645
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,352
Perhaps I could trouble you
to keep us notified

646
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,217
of how the case proceeds.

647
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:38,623
The safety and well-being
of our citizens is our primary concern.

648
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:40,957
Sure.

649
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:44,927
Did she have any documents

650
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,332
when you arrested her?

651
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,879
Give me the documents.

652
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,508
Your husband begged for his life.

653
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,349
But you won't beg, will you?

654
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,599
Jesus, it took you long enough.

655
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,227
Just tell me the bitch is dead.

656
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,677
The bitch is alive, Roman.

657
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,774
Maya?

658
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,342
And she's coming for you.

659
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:08,772
I have only a question

660
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:14,281
Only one question and that's why

661
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:18,752
But I can't think of an answer

662
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:23,223
There isn't an answer
that won't make me cry

663
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:29,359
It has to be a lie

664
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,332
That the story ends

665
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,268
Without you by my side

666
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,803
Hope I gave you

667
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:47,177
Everything you wanted

668
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:52,441
Hope I gave you

669
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,786
Everything you needed

670
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:01,454
I'd give anything to anyone

671
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:05,966
Just to hold you one more day

672
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:09,993
I should have loved you more

673
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:14,201
Before you slipped away

674
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:31,188
If I had only a reason

675
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,284
Just give me a reason

676
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,387
So I understand

677
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:41,231
'Cause the silence
is louder than thunder

678
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:45,636
And dark as the night falls
on a lovers' dance

679
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:51,471
It has to be a lie

680
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:54,674
That this story ends

681
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:58,549
Without you by my side

682
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:04,749
Hope I gave you

683
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:08,990
Everything you wanted

684
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:14,733
Hope I gave you

685
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:19,296
Everything you needed

686
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:24,209
I'd give anything to anyone

687
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:29,012
Just to hold you one more day

688
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,177
I should have loved you more

689
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:37,122
Before you slipped away

690
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:40,958
I know that I'll see you again

691
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,395
I don't know where

692
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,627
I don't know when

693
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:51,661
'Cause forever has no end

694
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:05,110
Did I give you

695
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:07,848
Everything?

696
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:10,982
Hope I gave you

697
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:15,962
Everything you wanted

698
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:21,097
Hope I gave you

699
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:25,230
Everything you needed

700
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:30,243
I'd give anything to anyone

701
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:35,248
Just to hold you one more day

702
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:38,581
I should have loved you more

703
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:42,316
Before you slipped away

704
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:48,584
I should have loved you more

705
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:52,963
Before you slipped away.
