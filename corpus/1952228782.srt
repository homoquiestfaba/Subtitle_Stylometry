All right, Todd, let's go.
Let's go.

2
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,300
All right.

3
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,432
Keep it up.
Keep it up. Yes.

4
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,346
All right.
Nice. Nice.

5
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,581
Control, Todd, control.

6
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:02,950
Keep him away from your body.

7
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,955
Keep him away from your body.

8
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,789
Damn it.

9
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,227
Stay focused.

10
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:15,232
lt's fine. Stay focused.
Come on.

11
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,851
Yes.

12
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:48,529
- How's she doing?
- Sex and violence.

13
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,534
That's what it's all about.

14
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:57,441
Fuck.

15
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,279
- Hey.

16
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,016

17
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,021
Shocker.

18
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,483
American, no hard
feelings, huh?

19
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:17,561
You don't play fair.

20
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,427
Oh, you're upset.

21
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:23,163
Screw you, you
uncircumcised little fuck.

22
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:26,466
Here.
My peace offering.

23
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,539
What's that?

24
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,804
A party.

25
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:33,811
Here we celebrate
after a match.

26
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,879
The girls here go crazy
for American boys like you.

27
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:39,980
All right.

28
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,985
- Girls, huh?
- Uh-huh.

29
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,722
The train to Odessa

30
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:50,821
l want all of you down here,
full gear, by 6:30.

31
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:53,729
We eat on the train, hmm?

32
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,095
Hey, Coach, uh, listen--

33
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,564
Shut up.

34
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,898
When you win, you can talk.

35
00:04:57,903 --> 00:04:59,767
l want all of you
up in your rooms,

36
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:02,400
get into bed,
lights out by 8:00.

37
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,305
No bullshit.

38
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,310
Mike and Chris.

39
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,247
Beth and Jen.

40
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:13,247
Todd and Sheldon.

41
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,216
Claire and Alex.

42
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,717
Night.

43
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,781
Night.

44
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,300
- Thank you.
- Get laid.

45
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:37,368
So, you and me?

46
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,604
Yeah. No, not gonna happen.

47
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,018
All right?
l'm only doing this for Alex.

48
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,814
Baby, it was one match.

49
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,844
You know you're
better than her.

50
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,584
You could easily
tear her face off...

51
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,352
if you wanted to.

52
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:53,382
But what if l don't want to?

53
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:56,423
Look...

54
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,826
you are really, really good
at this, you know?

55
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,831
You can go pro.

56
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,166
l just...

57
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:06,033
l wanna be a doctor.

58
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,268
You got pinned, that's all.

59
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,975
l'm quitting the team.

60
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,580
l know what you need.

61
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,086
You need to learn
the Todd Patterson...

62
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,553
invincible double-leg
double-hook throw.

63
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,519
- What?
- Go.

64
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:26,954
Now spread your legs.

65
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,255
Grab my neck.

66
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Spread again.

67
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,729
- What?
- Now pull me down.

68
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,728
See? lt works.

69
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:43,034
Okay, you gotta let--
Let go now.

70
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:46,040
l'm coming up.

71
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,946
l said spread 'em.

72
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,549
God, you are so beautiful.

73
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:59,853
Blue eyes, do you always
get this excited...

74
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,858
when you pin someone?

75
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
You betcha.

76
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,970
Okay. Let's go.

77
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,409
Come on.

78
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
Freedom.

79
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:29,080
Where do you think
you're going, hmm?

80
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,986
Ooh, look at that.

81
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:34,255
11:10.
Long after lights out.

82
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:37,206
We just wanted to get
some fresh air, that's all.

83
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,632
ls that weed?

84
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,135
We won't tell if you won't.

85
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,803
Where are you really heading?

86
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,605
- To get some fresh air.
- To a party.

87
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,906
- Bro.
- Hey.

88
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,573
lt's a fresh-air party.

89
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:58,378
Well, then...

90
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,450
let's go.

91
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,223
lt should be straight ahead,
one more block.

92
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Guys, where is this place?

93
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:32,808
Uh, it's 'Kanyazborst' and...

94
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,218
'Naza-vee-see-mostov.'

95
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,288
All right, thanks.

96
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,585
Oh, my God.

97
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,168
Dude, brace yourself.

98
00:08:58,243 --> 00:08:59,141
You're gonna kiss...

99
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:00,674
my mother-fucking
feet after this.

100
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,679
Man, what have
you done now, huh?

101
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,934
Jesus.

102
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:55,529
No. No, l can't do this.

103
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:17,387
Hey, we should go.
lt's late.

104
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,422
Did you have fun up there?

105
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,693
Claire, come on.

106
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:26,863
Claire.

107
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
American, where
are you going to?

108
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,799
We're in the
middle of the fun.

109
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,700
Claire, you coming?

110
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:36,902
No. She said l'll
take care of her.

111
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,406
What the hell are you
talking about, man, huh?

112
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,572
- Claire, come on.
- l say she stay.

113
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,045
What's your problem?

114
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,213
Claire.

115
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,548
Get your fucking hands off me.

116
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:49,680
Hey, we just wanna leave.

117
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,295
You wanna fight, huh?

118
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:01,355
You didn't get enough
mat for breakfast?

119
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,433
Todd-- Todd, don't do this.

120
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,171
American.

121
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,586
Hey.

122
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,219
Hey, why are you mad at me?

123
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,286
l had no choice.

124
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,022
Uh, yes, that's exactly
what you had, a choice,

125
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:30,257
and you chose to fight.

126
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:32,262
You could have avoided this.

127
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:37,693
Okay, wait.

128
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,858
l think we're very,
very close here.

129
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,007
What time is it?

130
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,458
You're all pathetic.

131
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:05,993
Bunch of losers.

132
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:07,461
You know what your problem is?

133
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,096
You're not athletes.

134
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,331
You have no idea
what team spirit is.

135
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:14,099
All you do is think
about yourselves.

136
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:14,979
Well, you know what?

137
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,236
l hope last night
was worth it,

138
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,472
'cause you just risked
the entire tournament,

139
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,440
not to mention your future.

140
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,075
Coach, l'm so sorry.

141
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
And you.

142
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:27,581
Odessa.

143
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:31,545
We need to get to
Odessa, the Ukraine.

144
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,623
Odessa.

145
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,591
Doesn't anybody speak
English in this country?

146
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,595
ls there a manager back there
that speaks English?

147
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,263
Eng--

148
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:45,032
Odessa.

149
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:47,037
Excuse me.

150
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:52,535
l couldn't help but
hear your predicament.

151
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,508
l might have a
solution for you.

152
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:55,609
Oh, really?

153
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:57,912
The train l'm on
reaches Odessa.

154
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:02,536
Can you please tell
this...lady...

155
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,184
what train you're on,

156
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:05,786
so we can buy tickets for it?

157
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,654
You can pay on board.

158
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,095
That's how it works here
on the smaller lines.

159
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,359
Come on, get moving.

160
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:14,764
You missed one train already.
Let's go.

161
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,320
Excuse me, friend.

162
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,325
Are you the captain
of this ship?

163
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:46,326
Conductor Vasily Alexie
at your service.

164
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,479
Great. Well, we want
to hitch a ride...

165
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:49,529
with you to Odessa,

166
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,534
me and my five guys.

167
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:55,535
Welcome to do svidaniya.

168
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,703
That means we'll show you
to your compartments.

169
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,777
Okay. Great.

170
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,316
You two.

171
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,386
Rad.

172
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:51,554
Passports, please.

173
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,226
What?

174
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:56,894
Please give me your passport.

175
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:58,765
Why?

176
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,770
Many...

177
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,908
- Stealers.
- Steal-- Stealers.

178
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,880
- Thieves.
- Yeah.

179
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,383
Yes. Thieves.

180
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,050
We save for you.

181
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,055
Save.

182
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:35,999
So gross.

183
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,610
Nasty.

184
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,099
l didn't even want
you for this job.

185
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:08,802
And what do you know
about wrestling anyway, huh?

186
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:09,870
You know what, though?

187
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,105
l didn't judge you.
l gave you a chance.

188
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,340
And then you do this to me?

189
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:17,244
Wait till Dean Edwards
hears about this, my friend.

190
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:18,311
And you know what?

191
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:21,911
Even if we make the match,
they're all drunk.

192
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:23,783
Casino.

193
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:26,552
Restaurant car, parlor.

194
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,584
Oh, it's been remodeled
and refurbished.

195
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,358
God, this train has
got to stop moving.

196
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,431
l'm getting seasick.

197
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,863
Shall l open the window?

198
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,099
Let the ocean breeze
swiftly waft through...

199
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:41,067
and take away your mal de mer?

200
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:43,131
Oh, shut up.

201
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,439
lf this stupid party,
man, messes up...

202
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:47,444
my chances for going pro...

203
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,840
Hey. Are you listening?

204
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,350
- Every word.
- All right.

205
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,450
Alex?

206
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,921
Oh, my God.

207
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:21,604
Hello?

208
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,654
ls anybody there?

209
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:35,011
What do you want?

210
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:38,378
l'm sorry.

211
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,544
l didn't mean to frighten you.

212
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,850
My face has this
effect on people.

213
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,118
l thought l was alone.

214
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
May l?

215
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,970
Uh, please.

216
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:05,372
l-- l didn't have a
chance to thank you...

217
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:07,775
for all you help
back at the station.

218
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:12,511
We will make it to
Odessa in time?

219
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:14,643
Even if we don't,

220
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,250
the rest of our team
will wait for us there, so...

221
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:19,052
- Oh.
- Yeah.

222
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:22,925
Where are you going to or--
or coming from?

223
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,994
l'm going home.

224
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,698
l don't like flying.

225
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:34,535
Call me old-fashioned,
but l love train rides.

226
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,810
The only downside is...

227
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:43,006
that sometimes gets...

228
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,081
lonely.

229
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:54,254
Lucky.

230
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,784
Luck has nothing
to do with it.

231
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,861
English.
Where you from?

232
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,240
Maybe you should take
it easy there...

233
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:06,366
with the smoking, huh?

234
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,669
Maybe it's not your
fucking business.

235
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,867
Deal you in?

236
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,505
Um, is it even legal?

237
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,510
Sometimes.

238
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,413
Lucky for us.

239
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,455
Oh, wait, wait.

240
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
lt's this one here.

241
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:59,403
Hey, you're not
gonna charge me...

242
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:00,753
for this, are you?

243
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:02,689
l read some stories...

244
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:04,889
in that college
regulation book...

245
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,963
you won't believe.

246
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
No.

247
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:13,369
Good.

248
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,405
Just relax.

249
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:21,071
You wanna hear
something funny?

250
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:23,909
l don't even know
your name, miss.

251
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,814
Doctor.

252
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,819
Dr. Velislava.

253
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,824
What do l need a doctor for?

254
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:52,709
Truth or dare, Claire?

255
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:55,769
Kiss my ass, moron.

256
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:05,621
You shouldn't have
said anything.

257
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,358
All right.

258
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,995
You asked for it.

259
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,226
Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,301
Suck it all.

261
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,561
My turn.

262
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,228
Well...

263
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,463
You have to ask, don't you?

264
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:53,032
Truth or dare, geek?

265
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:55,801
- Dare.
- Take your shirt off.

266
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, brother.

267
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,460
Did those hurt?

268
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:23,195
A little...for a second.

269
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:25,267
Freak.

270
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:29,071
lt's kinda hot.

271
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:31,273
Pain can be fun.

272
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:33,573
You know,

273
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:35,645
same nerves as pleasure.

274
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,330
Truth.

275
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:34,168
Okay.

276
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:36,578
So who do you hook up with
at the party?

277
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:39,706
No one.

278
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:41,711
Oh, come on, man.

279
00:25:41,713 --> 00:25:44,841
You disappeared
for, like, an hour.

280
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,714
Hey, don't be a jerk.

281
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,421
So?

282
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:55,191
No one.

283
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:56,756
lt's my turn, right?

284
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,761
Mm-hmm.

285
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,599
Truth or dare?

286
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:08,034
Dare.

287
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,259
Run to the end of
the train and back.

288
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,777
Okay.

289
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,583
Naked.

290
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:25,221
- There you go.
- You'd like that, huh?

291
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:32,225
That's fine. See?
l don't have anything to hide.

292
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,892
Better not let the coach
catch you like that.

293
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:37,025
He's going for it.

294
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:40,767
All right.

295
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:43,072
- l think that'll
be far enough.

296
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:43,936
Oh, my God.

297
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,671
- You sure?
- Yeah.

298
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,676
Okay.

299
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:52,578
lt's freezing.

300
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,746
Be right back, guys.

301
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:57,380
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

302
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:03,323
Oh, my God.

303
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:09,695
Hi. Excuse me.

304
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,706
Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

305
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,449
Damn it.

306
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:45,452
Fuck.

307
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:13,121
Guys, this isn't funny.

308
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Guys?

309
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,507
Look, l-- l don't
want any trouble.

310
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:53,495
ls anyone there?

311
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,782
What do you want?

312
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,719
Oh, shit.

313
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:20,055
You don't want to do this.

314
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,598
Stay away from me.

315
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:35,629
Stay away.
l'm warning you.

316
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:46,449
Oh, God.

317
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:02,361
He's not coming back.

318
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,063
He's playing.

319
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,664
He can't hide for too long,

320
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:07,669
dick hanging out and all.

321
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:12,007
l'm going to bed.

322
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:14,043
Yeah, me, too.

323
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:27,453
Looking for me?

324
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,821
Uh, no.

325
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:33,058
Todd's my best friend,
but, uh, you won't tell.

326
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,130
Good night.

327
00:32:40,664 --> 00:32:42,664
Todd?

328
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:49,333
Todd, are you back here?

329
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:08,053
You shouldn't be here.

330
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:10,652
lt's not safe for
you in these cars.

331
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:13,526
l'm sorry. l'm just looking
for my boyfriend.

332
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:16,327
There's no one here,
as you can see.

333
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:22,535
That's the machine room.
lt's locked.

334
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:25,131
No one can go in, not even me.

335
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:28,269
Do you mind if l ask you,
was he drinking?

336
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:32,147
- Yeah.
- Of course.

337
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:35,151
This happens every night here,
believe me.

338
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,516
- Yeah.
- Come.

339
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:40,285
l'll walk you back
to your compartment.

340
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:45,758
lf you don't find him
by morning, come to me.

341
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:49,130
l will personally help
you look for him.

342
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,208
Stop.

343
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:40,512
Oh, God. No.
Let go of me.

344
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:56,224
Okay.

345
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:25,187
Todd.

346
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,328
- Hey.
- Willy?

347
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:35,828
What are you doing here?

348
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:38,893
Sorry.
Coach locked the door.

349
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,265
l couldn't get in.

350
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,270
Have you seen Todd?

351
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:47,075
Coach?

352
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:50,045
Coach?

353
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:55,350
l'm sure someone has a key.

354
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,419
Real smooth.

355
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:01,353
This proves nothing.

356
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:03,122
He's probably off
training his golden boy.

357
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:06,062
Yeah, with his luggage
and toothbrush.

358
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,130
Excuse me.

359
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
Todd?

360
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:16,902
Hey, yo.
Come on. Todd.

361
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,008
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing, huh?

362
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,943
Let go. l'm looking
for my boyfriend.

363
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:26,311
Let go.
Don't touch me.

364
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:28,280
Let me-- Let go.

365
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:30,810
No, you look.
This is not America.

366
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:33,018
You're scaring the
other passengers.

367
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:34,887
lf you don't stop,

368
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:37,793
l'll confine you
to a locked compartment.

369
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,597
You said you'd help.

370
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:44,190
And l will.

371
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:47,897
Take her to her room

376
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,648
Hey, the conductor said--...

377
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:44,726
...wait.

378
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,850
Bad boy.

382
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,368
This is ridiculous.

383
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:30,322
The guy said--
You need to relax--

384
00:41:30,394 --> 00:41:32,824
Claire, stop, all right?
He should be back by now.

385
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:34,192
l'm not just gonna
sit and wait.

386
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:35,294
Well, the crew said...

387
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:36,995
they were looking
for him, right--

388
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,530
What if they're not
looking for him?

389
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:40,535
What if the
conductor sees you?

390
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:45,173
He's not.

391
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:51,308
Okay, wait.

Oh, my God.

394
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:55,600
What the fuck is that?

395
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:57,672
He's not in there.

396
00:44:01,545 --> 00:44:04,241
The conductor said
that's the machine room.

397
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:05,610

00:45:55,992 --> 00:45:57,992
No, no.

411
00:46:01,564 --> 00:46:03,564

Oh, God.

Let's get out of here.

443
00:51:02,565 --> 00:51:04,829
Holy mother of God.

- What about Claire?
- There's nothing we can do.

453
00:52:04,594 --> 00:52:06,424
We have to jump, now.

454
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:07,959
The fall will kill us.

455
00:52:07,964 --> 00:52:09,964

No way.
They were there.

00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:31,879
Oh, shit.

463
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,593
Come. Let's not do this here.

464
00:55:10,313 --> 00:55:13,111
Are you just gonna

What the hell is wrong

Why are you doing this?

Oh, fuck.

476
01:00:42,745 --> 01:00:44,508
No.

477
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,513

l told the doctor that
l'm in a lot of pain.

484
01:09:46,088 --> 01:09:47,484

is swelling...

485
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:51,084
or my body's rejecting it,
or l don't know what.

486
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:53,323
But l do know that
my family paid enough money...

487
01:09:53,328 --> 01:09:55,788
to give me a few more
fucking painkillers.

488
01:09:57,933 --> 01:10:00,458
