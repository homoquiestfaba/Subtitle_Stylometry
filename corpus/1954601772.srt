00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
No, no, no, no, no.

174
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008
No, no, no, no.
Ohh.

175
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,509
Oh, my goodness, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up,

176
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
pick up, pick up, pick up.
( sighs )

177
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
Damn! Hey, it's me.

178
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,014
I'm totally gonna
miss my flight.

179
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
I am so sorry.
Can you just tell Mom that something happened?

180
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
I don't know, say something,
like, spice it up or something.

181
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,220
Tell her that
there was an earthquake or something like that.

182
00:08:56,235 --> 00:09:00,239
<i>♪ It's like home to me ♪</i>

183
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,243
<i>♪ On a crazy spree ♪</i>

184
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,746
<i>♪ I can't let you be... ♪</i>

185
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,249
Man, just right up here
on your right is cool.

186
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,252
Thank you.

187
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,768
- That card's been declined.
- Of course it is.

188
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,273
Yeah, I'm sure
I have cash-- oh, Christ!

189
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,276
- Louis, you--
- Hello, hello, hello, you!

190
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,777
Mmm!

191
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,782
So, uh, you need a buck
or, uh, maybe you'd rather--

192
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,283
Yes, I need a buck.
Just--

193
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,785
Lou, just pay
the man, yeah?

194
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,788
Here you go, pally.

195
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,290
Keep it.

196
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,791
Here you go.

197
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,293
- Oh, let me get that.
- <i>No, I got it.</i>

198
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,794
- No, I got it.
- No, Lou, I got it.

199
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,296
I got it.
I'm here for you, I'm here for you.

200
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,797
- Nothing but a chicken wing.
- You're getting it. Okay.

201
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,800
- I am here for you.
- Okay, excuse me.

202
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,304
So, uh, rumor in the hood
is that you are newly single. What's that all about?

203
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,307
Uh, well, my husband
died a year ago,

204
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,808
so it's not that new.

205
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,310
Yeah, but you're
still single, right?

206
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,811
- Am I right?
- Not necessarily, all right?

207
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,813
A lot can happen
in a year.

208
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,815
- Yeah, like what?
- Like...

209
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,316
'90s hair can
go out of style--

210
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,318
are you still wearing
that cologne?

211
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,819
- That's my Sean John.
- Ugh.

212
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,324
Oh, and, like, '90s
tight acid-washed jeans didn't go out of style?

213
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,325
These aren't
acid-washed jeans.

214
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,826
- Psst.
- Hey, Louie, you almost ready?

215
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,330
- Hey, Dom, give me five.
- We don't have five, Lou.

216
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,831
It's Thirsty Thursdays,
we open early.

217
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,834
Dom, I'd like you to meet
my lady friend Lexie.

218
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,837
- Lexie, this is--
- It's Alexis, it's Alexis.

219
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,338
- Alexis, this is my friend--
- Boss.

220
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,340
My boss friend Dominic.

221
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,343
- Alexis.
- Nice to meet you.

222
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,346
<i>Hey, you should bring her</i>
<i>by the club some night.</i>

223
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,848
First two rounds
are on me.

224
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,853
Ooh! Big spender!
Big man on campus.

225
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,856
Alexis: <i>All right,</i>
<i>see you later, Lou-Lou.</i> <i>Gotta go see my family.</i>

226
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,358
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I haven't seen my family in a while.

227
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,360
As always,

228
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,862
it is a pleasure
and a privilege. ( clicks tongue )

229
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,364
You're still saying that?

230
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,868
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Before I forget, uh...

231
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,872
Freestyle Fridays.
Yours truly's DJ'ing.

232
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,874
- ( mimics record scratching )
- Lou-Lou, you did not--

233
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,877
- give it to me.
- ( beatboxing )

234
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,880
- Okay, Lou.
- I've been ballin' and I hurt my foot,

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,882
but I still
got moves, baby.

236
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,884
Sure.

237
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,419
Hey, hey, baby girl!

238
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,920
- Daddy!
- ( laughing )

239
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,923
I missed you so much!

240
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,425
Woman:
Leonard! Are you in the kitchen?

241
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,926
Get out of the fridge.

242
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,429
- <i>I told you we're going</i>
<i>to be eating soon.</i> <i>- Okay.</i>

243
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,935
( gasps )
<i>Hol</i>Lexita.

244
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,937
You're late.

245
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,940
Yeah, I forgot
to tell the pilot

246
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,442
that you were
a stickler for time, Mom.

247
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,444
( laughs, speaks Spanish )

248
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,450
Ma-- okay.

249
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,452
So how are you, Mom?

250
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,957
Okay, is this done?
I don't even know what we're doing.

251
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,461
- Lexie.
- ( sighs ) I'm sorry, <i>mija.</i>

252
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,463
It's just that we haven't
seen you in so long

253
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,965
and I'm just absorbing...

254
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,968
all of you.

255
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,970
Wow.

256
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,972
You really don't
disappoint, do you?

257
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,974
( speaks Spanish )

258
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,976
No, Mom, caffeine
makes me sleepy and you know it.

259
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,978
I just need to
take a shower. I had a long flight.

260
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,980
Yes, you go, <i>mamita,</i>

261
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,481
and brush your hair
while you're in there.

262
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,484
And if you need some makeup,
there's plenty in the cabinet.

263
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,989
I have makeup on, Mom.

264
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,993
( speaks Spanish )

265
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,502
She looks like <i>mierda.</i>

266
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,504
- <i>Ay.</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

267
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,529
- Holy Mother of God.
- Oh, shit!

268
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,530
I should have knocked,
I'm so sorry.

269
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,533
What if I was really
dropping a deuce?

270
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,034
( sighs )

271
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,036
Truthfully, I find it, um,

272
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,537
just a little bit
more disturbing

273
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,541
that Mom has a picture
of Daniel alone in the hallway.

274
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,543
Really?
I find it more disturbing

275
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,545
that you were having
phone sex with a chimp.

276
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,547
Wait, no, I thought
we weren't gonna touch that one.

277
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,048
- Oh, we weren't?
Oh, I'm sorry. -    <i>No.</i>

278
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,051
Oh, my God!
( laughing )

279
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,054
- I missed you.
- I missed you!

280
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,058
Oh, you forget.

281
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,061
Our mother is half hound,
she will find it, believe me.

282
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,563
- ( sighs )
<i>Hey, you found</i> <i>your skinny jeans.</i>

283
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,567
- Lookin' good, Mr. Kotter.
- Thanks.

284
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,570
I think if I fart,
I may rip the seams.

285
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,573
Okay. Turn that frown
upside down.

286
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,074
- You're home!
- For a funeral.

287
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,577
Well, if that's
what it takes so be it.

288
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,580
Anyway, who has time
for Danny drama

289
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,082
when our own loving mother
is waiting patiently downstairs

290
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,086
to deliver some <i>nove</i>style
drama of her own.

291
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,088
Did I tell you that
I was jet lagged?

292
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,089
Like, just
like this much?

293
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,090
<i>( Mom yelling in Spanish )</i>

294
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,592
Well,
ding, ding, ding!

295
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,594
Let the games begin.

296
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,099
Do I look... fat?
Or just bloated?

297
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,601
Is that
a trick question?

298
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,603
( gasps ) Come on!
I'm just kidding.

299
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,605
- ( groans )
- You look perfect!

300
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,106
This is gonna be
so fun!

301
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,409
<i>We're coming!</i>

302
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,699
Mmm! Mmm, mm, mmm!

303
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,701
( speaks Spanish )

304
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:23,205
<i>Hija,</i>    I made it
with one percent.

305
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,713
<i>Mam</i>can she
have some food?

306
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:37,720
( gasps ) Oh!
I'm sorr<i>mijita.</i>

307
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:46,729
She hasn't seen
"Real Women Have Curves" yet.

308
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,230
I got it for her
for Mother's Day.

309
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,232
How long
have I been home?

310
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,735
Long enough to remember
why you left.

311
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:56,739
So, Dad,
how you holding up?

312
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,741
Hmm? Yeah?

313
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,744
Got any last-minute details

314
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,746
you want help with,
any arranging, organizing?

315
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:07,249
<i>Ay, Dios mío,</i>
<i>always the party planner.</i>

316
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,751
Lexita, have you ever
thought about retaking

317
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,754
the dental
admissions exam?

318
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,756
Nope, never,
not once.

319
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,257
You should.

320
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:18,260
You know, if I hadn't
gone to trade school to become a hygienist,

321
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,762
Both:
I would have never met your father.

322
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,265
( laughing )

323
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,767
Yeah, see, I don't know
what that has to do with the conversation--

324
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,269
Okay, let me
just boom, bang, pow

325
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,771
<i>my way into this</i>
<i>potential disaster.</i>

326
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:34,276
- Party planning
is in Lexie's DNA. <i>Ay,</i> no.

327
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,278
So is bipolar
and depression--

328
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,780
Okay, it's in my DNA,
I got it.

329
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,284
You know, Mo is giving me
a lot of extra parties, you know?

330
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:45,287
And with the holidays
just a few months away, I'm gonna be a lot busier.

331
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:49,291
Santa's gonna need
helpers, like...

332
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,293
elves and such.

333
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:53,795
You know, I wonder
why Hanukkah Julio

334
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,297
isn't more popular
in Los Angeles,

335
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,299
seeing as it's
the city of Jews.

336
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,800
Angels, it's
the City of Angels.

337
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,803
- It's the City of Angels?
- Yeah.

338
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,805
And Hanukkah Julio
was a character Dad made up

339
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,307
to make sure that
we didn't feel alone in this world.

340
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:07,309
What? Dad!

341
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,311
That can't possibly
be a surprise to you.

342
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:12,814
- ( snickering )
- Oh, okay. Okay.

343
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:16,318
Well, since we are
revealing family secrets,

344
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,321
<i>I have one of my own.</i>

345
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:22,324
Has to do with you,
Lexita.

346
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:25,827
Okay, wait, this is not
another intervention

347
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,329
because I'm down
to four pills a day!

348
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,331
N<i>mija,</i>    we gave up
on that a while ago.

349
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,333
This isn't a blind date,
right, Mom?

350
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,336
No, it's so much better!

351
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,838
I ran into Mrs. Wasserstein
at an open house...

352
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,340
God, does she still think
she's related to us?

353
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,342
In fact,
she is related to us.

354
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,843
She's Uncle Stan's
ex-wife.

355
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,346
Uh, so, technically
she's not.

356
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,849
So, anyway, okay,
back to me, thank you.

357
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,351
She knows you're
back in town

358
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,354
and she wants you
to help with her daughter's Bat Mitzvah!

359
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:53,855
- You're welcome!
- What?

360
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,858
- <i>¿Que qué?</i>
<i>- Dude, is that</i> <i>your little secret?</i>

361
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,359
Yes!
Are you surprised?

362
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,362
Because...
you look surprised.

363
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,364
- This...
- Yeah.

364
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,865
...this is not surprised,
this is pissed.

365
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:07,369
- What did you tell her?
- I told her hell yeah, of course.

366
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,870
Did you tell her
that I don't have a business anymore, Kayla?

367
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,373
- No.
- Lexita, you know that we don't tell

368
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,875
- other people those things.
- Whatever.

369
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,377
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

370
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:16,878
- Right?
- No!

371
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:17,880
- Right?! Dude!
- No.

372
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,381
Come on! I have a life
that's 3,000 miles away.

373
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,883
- You have a life 3,000--
- I have a life 3,000 miles away

374
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,886
and I can't just put it
on hold because--

375
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,388
because you want
to book an event for me without my consent.

376
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,390
- ( scoffs )
- Lexie, look.

377
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,393
If you take this job,
maybe you can make some, uh,

378
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,395
some connections,
all right?

379
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,397
<i>And this way Wonder Bash</i>
<i>can have a new life,</i>

380
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,399
a rebirth of a sort
right here in New York.

381
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,402
Do you see how good
that sounds?

382
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:41,403
Oh, does it?
Does it really?

383
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,904
It does sound good.
You know what else sounds good?

384
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:43,906
Paying your bills

385
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,908
or pay for some
plane tickets.

386
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,910
Mom:
<i>I thought we all</i> <i>discussed this already.</i>

387
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,412
Alexis needs stability.

388
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,913
And party planning
will not allow her

389
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:53,915
the time she needs
to get her life together.

390
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,917
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

391
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,919
Wait, pause, on you.

392
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,421
When did we have
a conversation about my life without me?

393
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,422
I don't remember that.

394
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,923
We're a family,
we do it all the time.

395
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,926
Lexita, don't you think
it's time for you

396
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,428
to move on
from the parties?

397
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:10,432
From the kiddie parties
and the raccoon costumes?

398
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:12,434
For the one millionth
time, Mom,

399
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:15,937
Kung Fu Panda is a panda,
not a freaking raccoon!

400
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:16,939
Lexie, Lexie, Lexie--
Come on, Lexie!

401
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,440
Right now I need
a little air, Dad.

402
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,442
I mean,
look at my plate.

403
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,445
( sighs )
<i>Ay.</i>

404
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,448
It's the jeans.
They're so tight.

405
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,451
- She makes me sweat.
- Mom, come on, she's just--

406
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,953
Listen, reality sucks
for her right now.

407
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:33,455
Once it starts
getting better,

408
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,957
she'll live in it again.

409
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,460
Why should this night
be any different than the other night?

410
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,464
Is that
a trick question?

411
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,475
( voicemail recording )
<i>You have one new message.</i>

412
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:54,476
Mo on recording: <i>Mo here.</i>

413
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,978
<i>Hope everything's going</i>
<i>good with the fam.</i>

414
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,981
<i>I got some awesome news!</i>

415
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,983
<i>Thought it was worth</i>
<i>a quick call.</i>

416
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:04,486
<i>Mrs. Lopez wants to have</i>
<i>her son's fifth birthday</i> <i>next Sunday</i>

417
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:08,990
<i>and she requested</i>
<i>Handy Manny!</i>

418
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:11,493
Hola!
<i>So I thought of you.</i>

419
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,495
<i>I know you need</i>
<i>the cash.</i>

420
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:14,996
<i>Give me a call, let me know</i>
<i>if you're available.</i>

421
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,499
I hear he's much more popular
than Dora these days.

422
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:22,004
Vodka, soda, no ice,
still your fave?

423
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:24,506
( groans )
Why did you agree to it, Kayla?

424
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,007
Because you need it

425
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,510
and because you
need to pay me back for my plane tickets.

426
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,011
Mo just got me
another job.

427
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:32,514
I'm gonna be able
to pay you back like next week, all right?

428
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:35,016
- I'm fine.
- Fine?

429
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,518
Fine is an acronym

430
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:39,020
for fucked-up, insecure,
neurotic, and emotional,

431
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,522
so terrific
that you're fine,

432
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:44,526
but wouldn't you rather
be fine and happy?

433
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,528
- I'm happy.
- Mmm.

434
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:49,030
- I'm happy.
- ( chuckles )

435
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,533
And I'm--
I'm really close to clearing my debt.

436
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,535
Oh, your debt,
that's right.

437
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:55,537
You mean the debt
that you wouldn't have

438
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,538
if you hadn't overslept

439
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,540
and you would have actually
made it to the office

440
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,041
to serve him
the divorce papers?

441
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,543
- Yep.
- Yep.

442
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,044
Yep, that's it,
that's the debt I'm talking about.

443
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:06,548
- That's the debt right there.
- You know, Lexie,

444
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:09,050
if you take
this Wasserstein gig,

445
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,553
which my sources tell me
is two weeks away--

446
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,556
- Two weeks?
Two whole weeks? - Wait, wait, wait.

447
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:17,559
- ( sighs )
- I will...

448
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,561
get all
my open houses covered

449
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:24,066
and I will become
your personal assistant.

450
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:26,568
Your girl Friday of sorts.

451
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,069
Oh, my God!

452
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,572
We're gonna be like
Wonder Twins, dude!

453
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:33,575
Ooh, Wonder Twin powers,
activate! Come on!

454
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:36,077
Form of...

455
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,080
a supermodel.

456
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,082
Oh, my God.

457
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,587
Seriously.

458
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:47,089
Lexie...

459
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,091
would it kill you
to stay here

460
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:51,093
for a little while longer?

461
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,095
Fine.

462
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,098
Form of
a toilet bowl.

463
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,099
No.

464
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,600
You have to be a liquid.
Dude, come on.

465
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,602
- Seriously?
- Yeah!

466
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:04,106
Form of a stronger
vodka soda.

467
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:05,607
Done.

468
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:08,610
You know,
if Princess Leia

469
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,112
could choke
Jabba the Hutt

470
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:14,116
and free herself
while rocking a bikini,

471
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,618
then you,
my darling sister,

472
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,120
can most certainly...

473
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:23,125
rebuild the lost
Wonder Bash empire.

474
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,629
What is that,
one of your self-help books?

475
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,631
No.

476
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:32,634
It's a guide
to the best beaches in Hawaii.

477
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:36,638
Mmm, monkey humping
must be paying well.

478
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,139
It's from
my honeymoon, dude.

479
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,642
Oh. Sorry.

480
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,644
Well...

481
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,146
can't say it's not
a beautiful picture.

482
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:48,150
Frosty drinks always
make for a good shot.

483
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,153
Shots. Shots!
Come on!

484
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,154
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

485
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:53,655
I'm just
throwing it out there,

486
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:58,660
but tomorrow,
Freestyle Fridays, what, what?

487
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,661
Oh, my goodness!

488
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:01,162
You, me, and
a bottle are three.

489
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,664
Come on, what do you say?
Super fun.

490
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,172
No, thanks.

491
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,674
You're right.
You're right.

492
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:15,677
Why put off until tomorrow
what we can do today?

493
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,679
Shots, my darling!

494
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:21,683
<i>( church bell tolling )</i>

495
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,686
Hey, I'm sorry that we didn't
get to know her very well.

496
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:28,189
You know, I'm sure
she was a great woman.

497
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,192
Actually
she was miserable.

498
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:32,694
She was never happy
after Ron died

499
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:37,198
and she... she kind of
locked herself away from the world.

500
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,701
Don't do the same.

501
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,204
You're gonna end up
regretting it a lot.

502
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,705
I know she did.

503
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,210
If you learn anything from me,
it's to forgive, okay?

504
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,212
Estella:
<i>Leonard, let's go!</i>

505
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:52,714
<i>We have lots</i>
<i>of people waiting</i> <i>back at the house.</i>

506
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:56,217
I'm not saying it's easy,
but you gotta try.

507
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:13,735
Hi. Cheers.

508
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,239
Ugh! Boxed wine!

509
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,741
- Dad is so cheap.
Okay, listen. - I love boxed wine.

510
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,243
Mrs. Wasserstein
is in the living room, we gotta talk to her.

511
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:25,747
<i>Mira, hijas,</i> you think
this is a proper time to conduct business?

512
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:27,248
Mom, we get it.

513
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,251
You don't approve,
blah, blah, blah.

514
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:31,253
( speaks Spanish )

515
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:36,258
Well, at least brighten up
that sad, sad look on your face, Lexita.

516
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:38,260
- We're sitting shiva,
Mom, it's sad. - Yeah.

517
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,262
Well, if that's
your excuse, so be it.

518
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,764
Either way, I think
it's inappropriate.

519
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:45,767
But if you must...
<i>ay, mira...</i>

520
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,270
at least put on
some lipstick.

521
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,272
Okay, Mom, really?

522
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,773
Listen, I think
she has a point.

523
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:52,774
You might want to smile
a little bit...

524
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,277
Make sure
she puts it on.

525
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:57,279
She needs color.

526
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,281
( speaks Spanish )

527
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:02,284
<i>Hola!</i>

528
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:05,287
Oh, my goodness.
Well, <i>hola</i> to you, too.

529
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,788
You remember
my sister Alexis?

530
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:09,290
Of course I do.
How are you?

531
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,793
She-- well, we
are very excited

532
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,296
about helping Shari
with her Bat Mitzvah.

533
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:15,797
Well, I'm super excited, too,

534
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,298
'cause I'm getting two
for the price of one.

535
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,302
Well, metaphorically,
right? Right?

536
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,804
I'm really, really
appreciative that you're doing this,

537
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:25,306
especially considering
the circumstances.

538
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:27,309
That is my daughter Shari.

539
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,811
- Hi.
- Kayla: <i>Hey.</i>

540
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,312
Hi.

541
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:34,316
Okay. So, um, why don't we
get started on the details

542
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:35,817
seeing that
we're all here?

543
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,318
Can't start without
a fist bump.

544
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,821
Wonder Twin powers...

545
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:41,823
Activate!
Form of an iceberg.

546
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:44,326
- Fangirl?
- Totally. You?

547
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:48,330
- Since I'm, like, 23!
- Wow.

548
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,332
Super late start,
but still super cool.

549
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,334
Right?
Come on!

550
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,836
Okay, well, isn't
this just fabulous?

551
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:57,338
Am I being "Punk'd"?
Like, where are the cameras?

552
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:00,842
Anyway, so I had Shari's
therapist's receptionist

553
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,344
make you a tip sheet.

554
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:06,348
Yes, it seems that
the last party planner

555
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,849
dropped the ball
on a whole bunch of things,

556
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,351
and the catering got
the bulk of the budget,

557
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,854
so you've really got your
work cut out for you.

558
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,355
Um, before we start,
I'm so sorry.

559
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,358
I just wanna
double-check on this date

560
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:19,361
'cause my understanding was
that we had two weeks, not one.

561
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,364
Uh, no, that's correct.

562
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:26,368
And besides, I hear that you
can make miracles happen.

563
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:29,371
- Yes, she can.
- Yes.

564
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:32,373
Okay, well,
I guess, um,

565
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,876
we just have a lot to do
with a small window.

566
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:37,378
- What's left in your budget?
- Uh, hm.

567
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,881
Like I said, the caterer
took up a big chunk,

568
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:44,886
so I'd say about,
mm, 2,035, 2,036?

569
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,888
Wow, okay,
and how many guests

570
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:49,891
- uh, approximately
have RSVP'd? - About 60.

571
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,394
Wow, okay, well--
ahem.

572
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,397
So what we're gonna
do is we're gonna just

573
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,399
compromise on the venue
and we'll just be

574
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,901
a little more selective as
to how many superheroes we hire.

575
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:02,904
Ahem.

576
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:08,910
Oh, oh--
um, but, um--

577
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,412
but I'm sure that me
and my partner-in-crime here

578
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,915
<i>can totally make</i>
<i>miracles happen.</i> <i>- You know it.</i>

579
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:17,418
So, um, what is
the number one superhero

580
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:18,920
that you just must have?

581
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,421
I love Wonder Woman.

582
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:21,923
- Oh.
- That's great!

583
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:23,925
And the Wonder Twins.

584
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:26,427
- Oh, my God, this is
gonna be so awesome! - Okay, not your party.

585
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,430
- Um, do you have a dress?
- Yep.

586
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,432
But Mom doesn't approve.

587
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,435
Uh, in this case,
Mom is right

588
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:34,936
and you're gonna
have to get something

589
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:38,439
that's a little bit more...
fitting for the occasion.

590
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,942
It's totally fitting.

591
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:43,945
( speaks Spanish )

592
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:44,946
People are starting
to leave.

593
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:46,948
They want to get
home before sundown.

594
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,950
Come say
<i>Shabbat Shal-adios.</i>

595
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,953
Okay, well,
you have my number.

596
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:53,454
Feel free to use it anytime

597
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:55,457
and I just wanna say
that I think

598
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:58,460
it is fabulous
that you are moving on.

599
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:03,464
This is going to be
the best party ever.

600
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:04,966
Oh, and Kayla,
don't forget Gleek.

601
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,968
The twins are nothing
without him.

602
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,970
- You know that.
- Of course I do!

603
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,471
Who doesn't?

604
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:15,477
What?
Why the frown, Charlie Brown?

605
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:19,481
Kinda slipped up on that
timeframe, huh, sister poo?

606
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:20,982
Oh, please, one week.

607
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:23,484
We can so do this.

608
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:26,988
Just pull out your guns
and start firing.

609
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:29,490
Wine and dine
some old associates.

610
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:31,493
Just do your thing, sister.

611
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:32,994
I have seen you
do it before.

612
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:36,497
Yeah, when I had
a business, Kayla, okay?

613
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:37,999
And you just promised
that little girl Gleek.

614
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,001
You promised her Gleek,
and if my memory

615
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:44,005
serves me correctly,
Gleek is, um, a monkey.

616
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,008
Your memory
serves you incorrectly.

617
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,010
He's a blue monkey.

618
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,513
Where are we gonna find
a blue monkey in Brooklyn?

619
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,014
The Bronx Zoo.

620
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,515
- Blue.
- We'll paint him!

621
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:57,018
- I'm done with you, mm-hmm.
- Nice.

622
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,522
Not very Wonder-Twin-like
of you.

623
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,023
<i>Shalom.</i>

624
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,529
( speaks Spanish )

625
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,530
Titi wants to see you.

626
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:12,033
You haven't spoken to her
since Daniel's funeral.

627
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,534
Yeah because she doesn't
speak English.

628
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:17,038
<i>Ay,</i> Lexita,
don't make everyone pay for your misery.

629
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,544
Titi... hi.

630
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,046
<i>Ay.</i>

631
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:27,548
( speaks Spanish )

632
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:31,052
God bless "ju."

633
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,053
Did she just
call me a "ju"?

634
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:35,056
- ( speaks Spanish )
- ( speaks Spanish )

635
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,557
All right,
God bless you.

636
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,063
- What?
- She meant well, you know?

637
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:43,564
Yeah, Mom,
I'm sure she did,

638
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,567
but really,
the only person that's mourning

639
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,068
Daniel's death is you.

640
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:50,571
Are you that disconnected
from everything?

641
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,074
That you can't even see
how his death has affected you?

642
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:56,077
Okay, I am not gonna listen
to this psychoanalytic nonsense.

643
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:59,580
- <i>I'm just not.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>This is not psychoanalytical,</i> <i>hija.</i>

644
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:02,584
This is just obvious
to everyone.

645
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:05,086
Esse, your brothers
are here--

646
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:06,587
Chino, Chewie,
and Chachi.

647
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,590
<i>Ay.</i>

648
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,092
Leonard, you know
that's not their names.

649
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:13,594
Well,
they're still here.

650
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:19,600
- Thank you.
- Mm... yeah.

651
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,102
It looked painful
from afar.

652
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:24,105
I can only imagine
what it was like close-up.

653
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:25,606
No, no, you can't.

654
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,112
After 32 years,
I say I can.

655
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:35,116
Hey.

656
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,618
Let me ask you
a question.

657
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,621
Do you think I look
better than Princess Leia?

658
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:42,123
No.

659
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:45,626
Yes, no, I don't know.

660
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,128
- I don't even know
what you said. - Oh, you know what?

661
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:49,130
I told you
Mom is a bloodhound.

662
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,631
Come on.

663
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,635
I am so ready
to pop and lock.

664
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:56,137
Okay, are you ready?
Are you ready?

665
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:58,639
That's what
I'm talking about. And check this out.

666
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,141
Nice!

667
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,144
Yes, nobody puts baby
in the corner.

668
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:05,646
- Do you understand?
- Will they get over them?

669
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,148
Okay, now, seriously.

670
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,652
Would Han Solo
wanna get with this?

671
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:13,655
Would he wanna get
with this?

Wait for me!

679
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,888
- Ow!
- Hey, ladies.

680
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,890
What can I get
you tonight?

681
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,892
Two B&Bs.

682
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,394
A little fire in the hole
to get this night started.

683
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,897
Whoo!

684
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,399
We are going back,
way back.

685
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,402
- '91 style!
- Oh.

686
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,904
I was so much happier
in '91... and thinner.

687
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,407
Oh, my God,
I was born in '91. Awesome year.

688
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,413
- Me too,
I was born in '91 too. - Yeah, me too.

689
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,415
Whoa!

690
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,417
Think you could bounce
a nickel off of that butt?

691
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,419
Tried it...
it does.

692
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,921
Oh, man, Pizza Bagel.

693
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,923
How 'bout a round of drinks
on you for us?

694
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,926
- All right... Summer!
- Yeah?

695
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,428
- Okay.
- Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm.

696
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,429
Okay.

697
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,933
Glad you could make it.

698
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,434
Ahem.

699
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,437
So, uh, look around.

700
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,938
Take your time.

701
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,941
Let me know if there's
anything I can do you for,

702
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,945
and, uh, I'll be back
to dance with you...

703
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,946
later.

704
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,447
- Okay.
- All right.

705
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,449
Mm.

706
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,453
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm, mm.
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm--

707
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,956
Kayla:
Okay, is that-- is that, like, a move now?

708
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,458
- It sure is.
- That's how we do it.

709
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,460
- Wow, are you--
- Boys!

710
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,463
Back to the booth!

711
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,466
Pronto!

712
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,471
( both groan )

713
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,473
- Okay.
- ( yells )

714
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,474
Here we go.

715
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,975
- Shake the cooties off.
- ( sighs )

716
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,977
To the dance floor.

717
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,981
( both cough )

718
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,985
- You trying to poison us?
- Summe<i>Have fun, ladies!</i>

719
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,486

00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,538
Hey.

734
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,040
Do you think Mom
is disappointed in me?

735
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,043
Are you serious?

736
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,045
God, does this look like
a therapist's office to you?

737
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,548
All right, let me
ask you a question.

738
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,550
If the world
blows up tomorrow,

739
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,051
like the planet
Krypton did,

740
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,055
and everybody else is gone
off the face of the Earth

741
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,057
except you,
who are you gonna blame

742
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,560
for all your pain,
sorrow, and misfortune?

743
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,562
- Superman?
- ( laughs )

744
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,063
Good one, but no.

745
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,567
Mom! Because you're still
gonna be blaming her

746
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,569
for all your problems.

747
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,572
And even though
the world has blown

748
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,074
to millions
of little bits.

749
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,078
Uh-oh, like this.
Ooh, speakers!

750
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,086
- ( groans )
- ( crowd gasps )

751
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,588
Excuse me!

752
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,589
Oh, my God.

753
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,593
Summer on radio:
<i>Hey, um, Dom, we've--</i>

754
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,595
<i>we've got some</i>
<i>spring cleaning on the floor.</i>

755
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,097
Yeah, on my way.

756
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,599
Alexis:
<i>Oh, are you okay?</i>

757
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,601
Oh, are you good?

758
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,102
Oh, my God.

759
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,105
I just saw my whole
support system just crumble.

760
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,107
Are you okay?
Yeah.

761
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,608
Excuse me, guys,
excuse me.

762
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,612
- Excuse me, I got it.
- Oh, this is what I'm talking about.

763
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,615
Excuse me.

764
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,123
( gasps )
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

765
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,127
- Friend?
- No.

766
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,130
I me-- I mean
sister... friend.

767
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,635
Mm.

768
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,136
Thanks, Mom.

769
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,139
I was thinking she could
hide out for a little bit,

770
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,141
- you know, sleep it off.
- Yeah, thanks.

771
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,144
God, who knew that doing
the Running Man wouldn't be like riding a bike?

772
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,146
It's one of those moves that
requires some crazy skills.

773
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,648
I thought she had them--
yes, thank you.

774
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,149
Oh, will you
take that for me, please?

775
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,656
- Okay, ouch.
- What's up?

776
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,658
- Oh!
- What?

777
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,660
Wow, you're strong.

778
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,662
Just make sure
your brain's not bleeding.

779
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,165
Ah!
She's actually much nicer. I promise.

780
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,168
- All right, real quick--
- Let me-- let me get it!

781
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,169
Oh!

782
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,176
Did you put this here?

783
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,178
Oh... it's for me.

784
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,682
Um...

785
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,684
I'm gonna leave that
right there.

786
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,685
Um...

787
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,198
- So where are you
coming in from? - Uh, Los Angeles.

788
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,700
L.A., Los Angeles.

789
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,201
Oh, yeah?
Where in La La Land do you live?

790
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,704
Venice.

791
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,206
- Nice.
I used know it well. - Yeah?

792
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,209
Yep-- so what do
you do out there?

793
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,712
Oh, I--
I plan parties,

794
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,714
like events, and such,
and stuff like that.

795
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,220
- <i>It's like</i>
<i>an icebox in here.</i> <i>- Oh, thank you.</i>

796
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,723
Well, that's cool.
Who are you working for?

797
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,727
Oh, I, um-- it's for,
like, this newer,

798
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,228
like, smallish company.

799
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,730
You've probably
never heard of them.

800
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,733
The House of Patties,
and Events, and... Co.

801
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,238
You-- you mean that
burger place on La Brea?

802
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,241
Yeah, but I mean, like,
we do a lot more than flip burgers.

803
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,742
Yeah, like, we, like--

804
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,243
they throw parties there,
and, you know,

805
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,246
sometimes, in, like, big homes,
like, mansions and stuff,

806
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,748
like the Hollywood scene,
but that's, like, ugh.

807
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,752
- Yeah, I know them well too.
- Yeah.

808
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,255
So what is it
that you do?

809
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,258
I mean, like, do you,
like, travel a lot for work?

810
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,261
Or do you have, like,
a club in L.A.?

811
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,763
Uh, well, I, um--

812
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,767
my wife and I
lived out there pre-kid.

813
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,772
What brought you out
to the West Coast?

814
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,275
Husband.

815
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,779
Ah.
No ring?

816
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,284
Ditto.
( chuckles )

817
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,788
Long story.

818
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,291
Hey, you know what?

819
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,794
We should probably--
probably take this outside.

820
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
Oh, like,
keep talking outside.

821
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,306
So what brings you
back home?

822
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,309
Aunt's funeral.

823
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,311
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

824
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,313
- That sucks--
- No, it's all good.

825
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,815
- Thanks.
- So how long you in for?

826
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,819
Well, that was--
that's kind of a funny story.

827
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,320
I was supposed to leave
on Sunday.

828
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,323
And then, I got
a gig at the funeral.

829
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,326
( laughs )
Nice.

830
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,827
I mean, it's a weird place
to close a deal,

831
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,830
but, you know,
I guess business is business.

832
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,332
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

833
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,336
- Can't close just 'cause
the coffin does, right? - Right.

834
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,840
Except I, um--
Ahem.

835
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,342
I have one week
and no budget.

836
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,345
A week?

837
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,348
Oh, that's plenty of time
to get a gig up and running.

838
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,850
- With superheroes
and a monkey? - Sure, why not?

839
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,852
I mean, we throw
parties here all the time.

840
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,353
When there's a will,
there's a way.

841
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
Yeah.

842
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,358
There's a will.

843
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,361
Just don't necessarily
know about the way, you know?

844
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,862
Look.

845
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,864
You get some party favors,

846
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,865
couple of streamers,

847
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,367
some of those frozen
finger foods.

848
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,369
You know, maybe
a couple hot dancers

849
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,372
to spice up the night.

850
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,873
Done.

851
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,375
Yeah, it's not
a bachelor party.

852
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,378
It's a Bat Mitzvah.

853
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,380
Oh.
( laughs )

854
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,382
Okay, got you.

855
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,384
I thought superheroes
was code for strippers.

856
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,390
Boy on radio:
<i>Dad? You there? Over.</i>

857
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,391
Lightning speed. Over.

858
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,411
Hey, bud.

859
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,913
How you feeling?

860
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,914
I'm fine.

861
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,416
Who's that?

862
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,918
Oh, hi, I'm Alexis.

863
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,921
Hey, nice to meet you,
but I meant her.

864
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,923
<i>The snoring one.</i>

865
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,925
- Memo...
- Sorry.

866
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,928
It's-- it's--
it's all good. That's my sister Kayla.

867
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,430
We just came back in here
to get her because, well, it's getting late,

868
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,934
and, uh--
oh, we better get home or else.

869
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,938
Or else what?
Can you get grounded?

870
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,941
Surprising,
yet extremely possible.

871
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,943
- Yeah.
- Tell me about it.

872
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,945
When I went to visit
my mom last month,

873
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,447
she tried to ground me

874
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,949
for hiding in the trunk
of her limo.

875
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,454
- Limo?
- Long story.

876
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,456
Got it.

877
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,458
All right,
come on, sister poo.

878
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
Let's get on
out of here.

879
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,960
Thanks for the anger detox.

880
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,962
Hey, anytime.

881
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,963
And good luck
with that party.

882
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,965
Oh, thank you.

883
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,468
- And, um, good luck
with that long story. - Thank you.

884
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,972
All right.

885
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,974
All right there?

886
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,475
You good?

887
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,978
- There we go.
- Why is there a kid in here?

888
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,479
Okay.

889
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,983
Thanks for
the sweater also.

890
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,484
You think Mom has tuna?

891
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,487
- Okay.
- I like Bumble Bee.

892
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,989
( laughs )
She-- she doesn't really.

893
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,277
Smooth.

894
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,279
<i>( laughter and chatter )</i>

895
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,282
( screaming )

896
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:44,785
( laughing )

897
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:47,287
Mom, you can't be hiding
in the dark like a stalker.

898
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:50,290
I have been waiting
for you girls

899
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,293
for the past three hours.

900
00:41:52,293 --> 00:41:54,795
Oh, Christ, Mom,
we're not 16.

901
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,297
You can't just wait up
in hopes of grounding us.

902
00:41:57,298 --> 00:42:00,801
She can, she is
la reina de castiga.

903
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,803
Queen of punishment.

904
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:04,805
- That's impressive.
- I know.

905
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,807
( speaking Spanish )

906
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,811
Ooh, ironic.

907
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:13,313
Converting to Judaism really
did wonders for you, Mom.

908
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:15,316
Ma, don't listen.

909
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:16,817
It's just
the liquor talking.

910
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:18,819
She's drunk.

911
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:20,320
She's so drunk.

912
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:22,323
If I didn't have to worry
about you girls so much,

913
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:23,824
I wouldn't need these.

914
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:25,826
Oh, please.

915
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:28,328
Mom, I'm starving.

916
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,330
Can you make me
some tuna fish?

917
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:32,833
No, no, God,
you do not need tuna.

918
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,335
All right, I'm taking
Drunkie McDrunkersons upstairs.

919
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,338
( both laughing )

920
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:39,840
Remember, just bring it
upstairs, please!

921
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,342
- No.
- Ma, I'm starving!

922
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:45,346
Please, God, please,
don't make me kill them.

923
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:49,350
Oh, God, hey.
Okay, grab the bannister now, all right?

924
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,352
Can you believe
this woman?

925
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:53,354
Whoa.

926
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,857
Ugh, let it go,
Obi-Wan.

927
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:59,860
Let it go.

928
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,863
- ( gagging )
- Lift the seat!

929
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:23,384
Where's the aspirin?

930
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:24,885
Top shelf on the left...

931
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,889
next to the Gas-X.

932
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:29,890
Thanks.

933
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:34,394
You girls should
know better.

934
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:38,899
I thought I told
you both that, uh,

935
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:42,903
it's not very ladylike
to drink yourself into foolishness.

936
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:44,905
Yeah, well, you know,

937
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:47,908
sometimes, even
the perfect slip, Mom.

938
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,910
Good night.

939
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,412
So I hear that your sister
is taking time

940
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,915
from her job
to help you with this party?

941
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:56,416
Yeah, why?

942
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,919
( speaks Spanish )

943
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:02,423
Please.

944
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,425
( speaks Spanish )

945
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,926
So what is it
you wanna say?

946
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:08,428
I have nothing to say.

947
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:09,930
Right, because that's
in your nature

948
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,433
to just let things go.

949
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:16,437
Lexita, why
are you so angry?

950
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:17,938
I'm not angry, Mom.

951
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:20,440
I'm bitter.
Big difference.

952
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:24,945
- Lexita, it's not very becoming
of you to be so nasty. - Human?

953
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:29,450
Nasty?

954
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,453
<i>Lexita, mi hija,</i>
<i>why have you given up?</i>

955
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:34,455
Given up?

956
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:35,956
Is that what you think
that I've done?

957
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:37,457
You think
I've given up, Mom?

958
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,959
I haven't given up.

959
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:41,461
I'm-- I'm just trying to,
like, find my way.

960
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:43,964
- If you ask me--
- Well, I didn't!

961
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,968
Well, it looks as if
you've thrown in the towel.

962
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:49,970
You don't take care
of yourself anymore.

963
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,972
You-- you--
you look tired,

964
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:55,976
and, well... swollen.

965
00:44:57,978 --> 00:45:00,981
- As in fat?
- Not my words.

966
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:03,483
Is this about
the way I look?

967
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:04,985
Is that what's important
to you?

968
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,987
Lexita, the way someone
presents themselves

969
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:09,990
affects the way
they are treated. Trust me, I know.

970
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,493
People respond to those
who present themselves in a certain light.

971
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:15,996
And right now,
it is so obvious

972
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,498
that you have
absolutely no confidence.

973
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:22,002
<i>( bangs )</i>
<i>- Kayla:</i> <i>Mm.</i>

974
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:23,503
<i>Ay.</i>

975
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:25,005
She'll be fine.

976
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:27,507
Let her be.

977
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:29,009
She always gets up
after she falls.

978
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:34,514
I get up too, Mom.

979
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,516
Yes.

980
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:39,019
But you have always needed
a little assistance.

981
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:44,024
Why is it that you
can bury your past,

982
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:45,025
but I can't bury mine?

983
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:47,027
Lexita, I did not
bury my past.

984
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:50,030
I know exactly
where I came from.

985
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,532
That is why I have made
the choices that I have made.

986
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,035
Smart choices that have
gotten me right here.

987
00:45:57,538 --> 00:46:01,041
I tried everything
to make you proud.

988
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:06,046
I kept up
an amazing facade for years.

989
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:09,049
But when the payoff
is waking up alone

990
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:11,051
because you've been living
your life for everybody else but yourself,

991
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:14,554
you start to realize
image is not everything.

992
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,559
Lexita.

993
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,061
- Listen to me.
- ( scoffs )

994
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:22,562
<i>Listen to me.</i>

995
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:29,069
There was this one day
when I was walking

996
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:33,073
you and your sister
to Hebrew school.

997
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:37,077
And all of a sudden,
one of the mothers approached me.

998
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:39,579
She asked me
if I had my weekends free.

999
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,082
I didn't understand
what the question meant.

1000
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:44,084
I thought that maybe
she was confusing me

1001
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:46,086
for someone else
or that I was translating

1002
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:48,588
incorrectly in my head.

1003
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:50,591
So she quickly
rephrased the question.

1004
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:54,595
"Need mula?

1005
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:58,599
I -- no--
<i>Yo...</i> pay well.

1006
00:46:58,599 --> 00:46:59,600
<i>Mucho dinero."</i>

1007
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:04,604
I don't remember that.

1008
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:07,607
Of course you don't.
You were too young.

1009
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:10,611
But I have
never forgotten.

1010
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:15,115
Obviously, she thought
that I was your nanny

1011
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:16,616
and not your mother.

1012
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,622
So as far as I see it,

1013
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,626
image is everything.

1014
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,132
I'm gonna go
bring this to Kayla.

1015
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:56,656
To my lovely wife.

1016
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:59,159
<i>This is the best night</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

1017
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:01,161
I love you, Lexi.

1018
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:05,165
Ah!

1019
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:11,671
Daniel and Alexis,
have a wonderful honeymoon.

1020
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:15,175
<i>Bon voyage,</i>
<i>many great travels.</i>

1021
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:30,690
All I'm saying is Lex,
seriously, consider your source.

1022
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:33,694
The woman had to sacrifice
her pet lamb Cho Cho

1023
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:35,696
when she was, like, eight
to help feed the family.

1024
00:48:36,196 --> 00:48:39,199
- It was a goat.
- Whatever, Lex.

1025
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,700
I'm just saying look
at who you're dealing with

1026
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,703
before you end up
losing your mind.

1027
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:45,205
Oh.

1028
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:47,207
Before I forget,
we have a meeting with Mikey

1029
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,709
- in, like, 20
at Comic Circuit. - ( groans )

1030
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,712
So wash your mug
and giddyup, partner.

1031
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:52,713
We gotta get
this party started.

1032
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:55,716
Go, go--
♪ Go. ♪

1033
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:57,217
Hey, Rob?

1034
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:59,719
Yes,
I'm thinking about it.

1035
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,222
I know the ceilings are low,
but she's freaking Filipino.

1036
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:04,474
How much head room
could she possibly need?

1037
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,987
Ah! The Justice League
of America.

1038
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,990
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hey.

1039
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,491
I got your stack
in the back.

1040
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,493
- Okay.
- Gimme a sec.

1041
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,496
No problem,
you take your time.

1042
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,997
I'm not going anywhere.

1043
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,000
Don't rush
on my account.

1044
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,503
( giggles )

1045
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,505
So cute.

1046
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,006
- Ew.
- What?

1047
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,008
Were you just flirting
with a 13-year-old?

1048
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,010
- He is 19.
- He is a fetus.

1049
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,511
- You are creepy.
- Perfectly legal.

1050
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,013
- I respected you
25 seconds ago. - He can vote, can't he?

1051
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,516
- Hey, the younger the berry--
- Um, Demi.

1052
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:50,019
I beg you not to finish
that sentence, "por favies."

1053
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,025
What are we supposed
to be looking for anyway?

1054
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,027
Inspiration.

1055
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,031
Is this where you come
to find the nerd of your dreams?

1056
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,037
Well, that depends.
Are you a nerd?

1057
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,541
( laughs )
No. I don't know.

1058
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,544
Actually,
maybe I didn't-- I'm not sure.

1059
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:18,047
Well, that's too bad
'cause then my answer would've been yes.

1060
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,052
Dad!
Look who I found!

1061
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:24,554
Okay, what happened
last night

1062
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,056
and who is this kid?

1063
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,559
- "The younger the berry..."
- ( gasps )

1064
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,562
Okay, I am gonna go look
for Batman Issue 515.

1065
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,564
I will be right back.

1066
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,566
Um, there's no way
you would even know

1067
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,568
anything about that issue,
so stay here.

1068
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,570
Who are you?

1069
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,078
Ahem.

1070
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,083
- So, uh...
- <i>Can I take you out?</i>

1071
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,088
I'd like
to take you somewhere.

1072
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,094
Somewhere sounds great.

1073
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,096
Tonight?

1074
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,099
Make a few calls,
see if I can find a sitter.

1075
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,603
- No way, Hal Jordan
is a way better GL. - Um, wrong.

1076
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:17,607
- Kyle Rayner could
beat him hands down. - <i>You're insane.</i>

1077
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,611
Bingo.

1078
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,614
You owe me.

1079
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,617
I know.

1080
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,619
- Big.
- I know.

1081
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,120
Ew.

1082
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,624
Really? Ponytail?

1083
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,628
It's not very sexy,
Lexi, I'm just--

1084
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,130
But it's the only way
that I can get rid of my grays.

1085
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,132
Or hair dye.

1086
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,635
Dude, I don't have the money
to do regular upkeeps.

1087
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,637
Oh, my God, because
the last time I checked,

1088
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,639
Clairol was, like, $4.

1089
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,643
- Do I look desperate?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1090
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,148
Manufactured happiness
is not gonna get you laid.

1091
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,152
Yeah, but it's definitely
gonna get me through tonight.

1092
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,657
So you're, um--
you're a serial killer.

1093
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,162
Well, serial killers
usually get paid more.

1094
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,164
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, they got more lines.

1095
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:18,168
They have ransoms to request,
threats to make,

1096
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,670
and negotiations
to work out with the 5-0.

1097
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,171
Fascinating.

1098
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,674
I've never met a reenactment
actor before.

1099
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,175
I-- you know,
I can't believe

1100
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,678
that I'm sitting here
with the Green River Killer.

1101
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,179
Kind of freaky.

1102
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,683
So is that
your long story?

1103
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:38,187
No, but it, uh--
it does lead into it.

1104
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:42,192
I met my long story

1105
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,695
playing Ted Bundy,

1106
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,699
and she was cast
as one of my victims.

1107
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,701
- Hm.
- It's pretty romantic, huh?

1108
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,704
Very, very romantic.

1109
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,206
So is this one of those,
like, to-be-continued

1110
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,210
or tune-in-next-week
kind of stories?

1111
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,212
No, no.

1112
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,215
It's, uh--
it's a the-end kind of story.

1113
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,717
It's over.

1114
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:12,221
So, uh, does
she stay in L.A. to pursue the dream?

1115
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,723
No, no.

1116
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,726
She's, uh...
she's living the dream.

1117
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,231
She's one of the biggest
<i>novella</i> stars out there.

1118
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,234
She even managed
to make, uh...

1119
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,738
"People <i>en Espanol"s</i>
<i>Top Ten Most Beautiful Women.</i>

1120
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:30,740
Mm.

1121
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,744
Um....
( sighs )

1122
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,746
So that's-- I mean, that's--
that's really, uh...

1123
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,748
Spooky.

1124
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,751
( laughs nervously )

1125
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,753
So, I mean,
if she's all that,

1126
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,756
then why--
why with the divorce?

1127
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,258
Well, exactly that.

1128
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,761
She thought
she was all that,

1129
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,264
and she wanted
an all-that kinda guy to be at her side.

1130
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,769
And you're not
an all-that kinda guy?

1131
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,274
Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean that like that.

1132
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,775
- I--
- Mm... no, no.

1133
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:06,776
It's all good.

1134
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,778
Hey, you know,
I should call home

1135
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,279
and check in on Memo.

1136
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,282
- Um...
- Yeah.

1137
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,285
- Or relieve Memo.
- Yeah, more like save Kayla.

1138
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,789
Your story's next.

1139
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,290
Oh, yeah,
I plead the Fifth.

1140
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,292
Oh, yes,
there's no way in He--

1141
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,796
hello there, buddy.
How you doin'?

1142
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,799
But that's kind of you.

1143
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,301
- Thanks for the flowers.
- Sure.

1144
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:35,805
I didn't know you weren't
a fan of things that die.

1145
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,809
Yeah, well, I'm working
on that, okay? ( laughs )

1146
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:45,315
This is so beautiful.

1147
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,317
So...

1148
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,819
you win-- what do you want
to know about me?

1149
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,821
- Well, the drama.
- Oh.

1150
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,823
- That's what
makes a good story. - Oh, well, of course.

1151
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,825
( laughs )

1152
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,827
I followed
my perfect husband

1153
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,829
to California about
four years ago

1154
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,832
for the perfect job as
the perfect entertainment lawyer

1155
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:06,335
extraordinaire to the stars.

1156
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:10,340
Uh, we were
high school sweethearts

1157
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,842
voted "Most Likely to Live
Happily Ever After,"

1158
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,845
and my parents...

1159
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:18,848
absolutely adored him.

1160
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:19,849
- Wow.
- Yep.

1161
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,350
- Pressure.
- Mm!

1162
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,352
( both laugh )

1163
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,354
Yeah, you're telling me.

1164
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:27,357
Um... you know,
on paper, he was ideal,

1165
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,358
the perfect show dog.

1166
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,360
Bring him in front
of the audience

1167
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,362
and he's trained
and groomed.

1168
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,364
And take him
behind stage,

1169
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,366
and he bites and growls
like Cujo.

1170
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,868
Well, Cujo eventually
got what was coming to him.

1171
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,873
Yep.
So did Daniel.

1172
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,877
Seriously?
Dude croaked?

1173
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,380
Yep.

1174
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:56,386
Not so happily-ever-after
after all.

1175
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,887
Oh, man,
I'm so sorry.

1176
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,891
You know...

1177
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:02,892
I still don't know
what hurts more--

1178
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,895
the fact
that the police report

1179
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,899
listed his death as
"vehicular blowjob"

1180
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:13,402
or the fact that I never got
to tell him to go to hell.

1181
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:16,906
You know, it's just--
( groans )

1182
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,407
Wow.

1183
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:19,909
I asked for drama,
I sure got it.

1184
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,910
( laughs )

1185
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,412
You're welcome.

1186
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,415
( laughs )

1187
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,417
You know, as they say,

1188
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,419
you know, let bygones
be bygones, right?

1189
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,422
Yeah.

1190
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,924
Tell my mother that.

1191
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,445
Yeah, we should
probably go, right?

1192
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,946
It's getting really late
and I have to wake up

1193
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,948
early in the morning,
and I have to go meet

1194
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,450
this old associate
to nail a chimp.

1195
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,453
Nail down a chimp-- nail down
a chimp is what I meant.

1196
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,954
You know?

1197
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,455
Not to mention
that I don't have a DJ

1198
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:10,460
or a photographer
or a superhero to save my life.

1199
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,462
Well, we can get Louie
to DJ for you.

1200
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,464
The guy owes me big,
I mean, he's got a bar bill

1201
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,966
he'll never be able
to pay off.

1202
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,467
- Really?
- Yeah.

1203
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,469
'Cause, I mean,
that would be awesome.

1204
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,972
And I-- I may not be
a professional photographer

1205
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,974
or anything,
but I've taken

1206
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,475
my fair share of pictures
over the years

1207
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,977
of, you know,
Memo and his pals.

1208
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,479
Like, I could do that
for you if you want.

1209
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,487
What's the catch?

1210
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,992
Just a second date.

1211
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,506
Kayla:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i> <i>You didn't get to second base?</i>

1212
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,008
- Can't say that I'm jealous.
- Oh, you should be.

1213
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:02,011
Why? My night
consisted of dwarfs,

1214
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:05,514
princesses, warriors...
Lucky Charms.

1215
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,517
- Hot.
- Oh.

1216
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,519
- What?
- Maybe it was the grays

1217
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,521
that kept you from getting
to second base.

1218
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:12,522
( laughs )

1219
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,023
Oh.

1220
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,528
She must've
thrown in the towel.

1221
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:26,035
Um, well,
I'm gonna go to bed.

1222
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,037
It's late,
you coming up?

1223
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,038
You know, I'm gonna--

1224
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,539
actually, I'm gonna
get a snack.

1225
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,041
Didn't you just eat?

1226
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,542
Uh, no.

1227
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,045
It was a first date,
you don't eat on the first date.

1228
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,048
Wow, it's been
that long?

1229
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,549
Must've forgotten
the rules.

1230
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,052
All right,
I love you.

1231
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,053
Don't stay up
too late, please.

1232
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,054
Love you.

1233
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,785
Is she still
as annoying as ever?

1234
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,788
- Shh!
- <i>( monkey grunting )</i>

1235
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,790
You only think
that she's annoying

1236
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,291
because she hit on you
that one time.

1237
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,793
- One time.
- Yeah, one time.

1238
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,295
( scoffs )

1239
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:12,298
Look, the bottom line
is is that we need a monkey ASAP.

1240
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,801
Blue... monkey.

1241
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,803
Right, a blue monkey.

1242
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,805
So if that means
sucking up her advances

1243
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,307
and, you know, fulfilling
that promise you made

1244
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,808
to that little girl,
then I say you need

1245
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,811
to buck up
and take one for the team.

1246
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,812
- Buck up?
- Buck up.

1247
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,814
I'm not leaving here
without a deal.

1248
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,316
Says the pimp.

1249
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,818
Ladies.

1250
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,820
Oh, you look fabulous
for a widow.

1251
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,822
Oh.

1252
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,323
And you.

1253
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,826
Yeah, I need to--
I'm just-- it's important.

1254
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,328
Still like a giant
kangaroo rat--

1255
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,832
small and cute,
but completely unavailable

1256
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,835
- due to your
endangered status. - And you--

1257
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,838
I am so excited to see
what you picked out for us.

1258
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,840
- Aren't we, sis?
- Please, after you.

1259
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,842
Awesome.

1260
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,845
And after you.

1261
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,847
Case, hold
all my calls, please.

1262
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,853
So I've got
some real cute ones.

1263
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,856
Oh, thanks,
let's see.

1264
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:10,857
Oh, wait, I didn't know
you did "Babe."

1265
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,858
I saw
the poster out there.

1266
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,360
You did?
Oh, honey.

1267
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,861
I only do babes.

1268
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,367
Oh, yeah,
this is not gonna work.

1269
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:25,371
This is light blue, Gleek
is more of a... royal blue.

1270
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,872
Yeah, Jude,
when I said blue,

1271
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,376
I meant totally blue,
not just the balls.

1272
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,877
Well, tall order.

1273
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,380
Small budgets
gets you this.

1274
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,383
Unless you'd like
to barter a deal.

1275
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,885
A deal?
Oh, God.

1276
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,387
I'm gonna be honest, Jude--
I mean,

1277
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,389
I really just don't have
anything to offer in return.

1278
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,391
They have such
a tight budget,

1279
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,394
and she has me, like,
right by them too, you know?

1280
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,900
Oh, what?

1281
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,405
- Me?
- Just a thought.

1282
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,406
Well, like a date?

1283
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,909
Like, just the two
of you?

1284
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,911
- I don't see
how one drink could hurt. - Oh.

1285
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,914
( laughs )
I love that you haven't lost your professionalism.

1286
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,415
Now, you're
making me blush.

1287
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,417
Um... you know what?

1288
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,419
I need to see you
for a minute.

1289
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,922
- Or two.
- Oh. I'll be right back.

1290
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,925
Like now?

1291
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,428
I'm not getting traded
for a monkey.

1292
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,429
I was kidding
when I called you a pimp.

1293
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,931
It's just one drink,
all right?

1294
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,934
Jude is a scary,
hungry woman,

1295
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,936
and I'm not going
anywhere with her. The end.

1296
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,438
You're gonna have to
tell her that we need to work out another deal.

1297
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,441
- I can't.
- Why? Why can't you?

1298
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,942
Because we need this.

1299
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,448
Fine,
because I need this.

1300
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,452
Man, Lexi,
Mom was right.

1301
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:47,954
You've given up.

1302
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,956
- Excuse me?
- Mm-mm.

1303
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,958
No, get back--
where are you going?

1304
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,962
I honestly, honestly think
that you need to do this on your own.

1305
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,464
Wait, are you in cahoots
with Mom or something?

1306
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,967
- No, I am--
- This is not like you.

1307
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,970
I am bailing because
I'm not a carpet muncher

1308
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,973
and I'm not gonna be traded
for some blue-balled monkey.

1309
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,475
- ( muttering )
- I cannot talk-- what are you doing?

1310
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,977
- I'm gonna say--
- Carpet muncher?

1311
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,480
Really?
How phobic of you.

1312
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,982
You know what, Lex?
I'm thinking this isn't going to work out.

1313
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,484
I prefer to work
with professionals only.

1314
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,486
Wait, wha--
( stammering )

1315
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,488
But you just said
that you loved my professionalism.

1316
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,491
- We smiled.
- Yeah, I did,

1317
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,493
but that was before
I was referred to as a muncher.

1318
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,496
Oh, like I'm really
that far off.

1319
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,498
Can I just--

1320
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,000
do you remember when I wanted
to quit real estate classes what you said to me?

1321
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,504
You said that
you can't fail if you finish.

1322
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,005
I stole that
from a self-help video.

1323
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,009
Whatever, Lexi, damn,
I'm just saying

1324
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,011
that you can't
let Daniel, and Mom,

1325
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,013
and your fucking insecurities
dictate your life.

1326
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,015
Ladies, I hate
to do this,

1327
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,517
but if you could take your
after-school special outside,

1328
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,018
that would be great.

1329
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,021
I'm trying to conduct
a business here.

1330
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,024
- Lex...
<i>Thank you.</i>

1331
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,028
By the way,
I'm not phobic.

1332
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,531
I just prefer brunettes.

1333
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,039
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1334
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,041
Excuse me.

1335
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,545
Um, question.

1336
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,046
Is this animal-safe?

1337
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,050
It's not tested on animals,
if that's what you mean.

1338
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,052
Yeah, I get that--

1339
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,054
I'm asking if you can
use it on animals.

1340
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,555
I don't know.

1341
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,560
Really helpful,
you can just begin--

1342
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,061
you can just package
all that up right there.

1343
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:37,563
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

1344
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,568
- Hello?
- Alexis.

1345
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,570
Uh, hi, this is
Mrs. Wasserstein,

1346
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,573
and I am calling
with some bad--

1347
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,074
some awful news.

1348
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,077
Apparently, my very
defiant daughter

1349
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,579
<i>has taken it</i>
<i>upon herself to cancel</i>

1350
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,080
<i>her very own Bat Mitzvah.</i>

1351
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,083
Wait, wait, wait,
what, why? Why?

1352
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,584
<i>She, uh, has</i>
<i>made up her mind,</i>

1353
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,586
and is adamant about
wearing a dress

1354
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:04,089
that I feel is
completely inappropriate

1355
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:07,093
for a young lady to wear
on such a special occasion.

1356
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,595
Well, and-- like, maybe
if I can talk to her, I can--

1357
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,096
<i>Oh, she won't listen</i>
<i>to anybody.</i>

1358
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,100
- Oh.
- Inappropriate?

1359
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,601
As if she thinks
I have fat knees

1360
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,102
and she doesn't
want to be embarrassed

1361
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,105
in front of all her friends.

1362
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,106
Give me that!

1363
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,108
Uh...

1364
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,110
okay, well, then, I guess
I just have some calls to make,

1365
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,115
and... good luck
to you and Shari.

1366
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,617
Yes, well, that's why
we're in therapy together.

1367
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,118
Best of luck to you
as well.

1368
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,620
<i>( siren wailing )</i>

1369
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,135
<i>( doorbell buzzes )</i>

1370
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,159
( knocks on door )

1371
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,171
Memo:
Hold your horses! I'm coming!

1372
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,676
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>
<i>- Hey, Alexis.</i>

1373
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,679
Um, is my dad expecting you
or something?

1374
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,682
Uh, no.

1375
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,184
I just was in
the neighborhood, and I needed some milk.

1376
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,187
Okay.

1377
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,188
Well, he's in
his office, so...

1378
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,191
Okay, great, thanks.

1379
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,193
Now, I gotta get back to kicking
some Grand Theft butt!

1380
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,696
Awesome.

1381
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:53,699
Woman:
<i>I've waited too long for us</i> <i>to be together again.</i>

1382
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,200
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to the passion,</i>

1383
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,702
<i>our dreams,</i>
<i>our love for each other?</i>

1384
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,705
I can't afford to get myself
wrapped up again

1385
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,707
in all of your drama.

1386
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,709
Look, you know
I'll always have

1387
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,711
<i>a special place</i>
<i>in my heart for you.</i>

1388
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,213
<i>But with everything</i>
<i>that's happened, I can't</i> <i>take that risk.</i>

1389
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,715
But you promised.

1390
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,216
You said that if I could
figure out a way

1391
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,719
to get rid of James,
then our lives would change,

1392
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,220
<i>and I did.</i>

1393
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,223
<i>I did what you asked</i>
<i>of me.</i>

1394
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,224
What more do
you want from me?

1395
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,725
Nothing!

1396
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,226
That's just it.

1397
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,732
Are you really going
to say no to me?

1398
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:27,733
Look at what
I'm offering you.

1399
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,236
Oh...

1400
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,239
Hey, you.

1401
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,740
I didn't know
you were dropping by.

1402
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,744
Uh, yeah, I, um--
I tried calling.

1403
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,747
Yeah, my-- my phone
is in the charger.

1404
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,249
- <i>Yeah, we were just--</i>
<i>- You know what?</i>

1405
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,251
I'm actually--
I'm gonna go.

1406
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,752
I'm gonna go
because I have to go.

1407
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,254
Um, but it was nice
meeting you.

1408
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,757
I don't think
we actually met.

1409
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:52,758
You are...

1410
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,761
Leaving.

1411
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,771
( speaks Spanish )

1412
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,273
You must've missed
the cash-for-clunkers program.

1413
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,276
You could've traded that one in
for some good pocket change.

1414
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,778
- Do not do that.
- Do what?

1415
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,779
Tell the truth?

1416
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:19,785
( scoffs )

1417
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,795
Dad?

1418
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,799
Hey.
Baby girl, you okay?

1419
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:37,803
I don't know.

1420
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,307
I'm sorry I pulled you
out of your meeting.

1421
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,809
No worries, I already know
the hidden truth behind the hidden tooth.

1422
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:45,811
And to be perfectly honest,
you saved me

1423
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,813
from having to drive
Stan Krieger back to Jersey.

1424
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,818
So... talk to me, Lexi.

1425
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,319
What's got your feathers
all ruffled up?

1426
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:57,823
The Bat Mitzvah's off.

1427
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,825
Oh, no.

1428
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,827
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lexi.

1429
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,830
I honestly don't know
what to do anymore, Dad.

1430
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,834
What happened?

1431
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,837
Mrs. Wasserstein
is set on torturing

1432
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,840
and controlling her daughter
for the rest of her life.

1433
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,842
Okay, then.

1434
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,343
What about Shari?

1435
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,347
She's not talking
to anyone.

1436
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,850
I don't-- I don't even
know what I would say to her if I could.

1437
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,352
Well, you could say
that she's missing out

1438
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,355
on a really big thing
in life.

1439
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,357
It's really a big deal

1440
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,858
and that there's nothing
worse than regret.

1441
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,861
And you also could
tell her you have a mom.

1442
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,363
You understand
her frustrations.

1443
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,366
You could tell her
that it's all going

1444
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,368
to work itself out
in the end.

1445
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,869
It always does, Lexi.

1446
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,370
You know that, right?

1447
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,376
Yeah.

1448
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,378
Now sometimes,
you have to fight the fight

1449
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,881
to get what you want.

1450
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,884
- You want it?
- I do.

1451
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,386
Then go and get it.

1452
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,390
You've done it before.

1453
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,392
And remember--
the Fish family are not quitters.

1454
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,395
Now, we tend
to come in last a lot,

1455
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,897
but we do not quit.

1456
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,403
Talk to Shari.

1457
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,905
I really think
this will be a good thing for the both of you.

1458
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,908
- You're probably right.
- I am.

1459
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,911
And you know,
it won't hurt for you

1460
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,913
to talk to
your own mom too.

1461
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,915
Tell her the truth
about Daniel--

1462
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:31,917
Dad... Dad.

1463
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,920
She deserves to know.

1464
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,922
Give her the benefit
of the doubt, Lexi.

1465
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,925
You know,
she does mean well.

1466
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,927
It just sometimes
comes across

1467
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,930
in a lovingly
brutal way, you know?

1468
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,932
Is it even worth
the risk?

1469
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,937
Yeah, everything in life
is worth the risk.

1470
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,439
It's just up to you
to figure out

1471
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,442
if it's important enough
for you to take it.

1472
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,447
( sniffles )

1473
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,450
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

1474
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,451
I am.

1475
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,460
<i>( music playing )</i>

1476
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,462
- Hey.
- Mm.

1477
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,464
- Good morning.
- Where's Dad?

1478
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,466
At the store.

1479
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,967
Those look gross.

1480
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,469
Oh, no.

1481
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,971
( speaks Spanish )

1482
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:29,474
Liliana's about to seduce
her husband's killer.

1483
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,477
( speaks Spanish )

1484
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,979
No, Mom, please not today,
not today, please not today.

1485
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,480
I wasn't going
to say anything,

1486
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,483
but please, just put
my show back on.

1487
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,489
Look at her.

1488
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,491
<i>( speaks Spanish )</i>

1489
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,992
<i>She's perfect.</i>

1490
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:47,993
<i>I bet you she never</i>
<i>goes out of the house</i>

1491
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,995
-    <i>without her makeup on.</i>
<i>- She doesn't.</i>

1492
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,499
So your father tells me
that the Bat Mitzvah

1493
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,502
has been cancelled--
what happened?

1494
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,504
Shari's mom wants her
to get another dress,

1495
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,506
but Shari refuses, so...

1496
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,009
And that's it?
It's just about a dress?

1497
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,510
So why doesn't Shari
just listen

1498
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,514
to what her mother asks
and pick another dress?

1499
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,016
I don't know,
she's a pre-teen.

1500
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,018
They never listen
to their mothers.

1501
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:16,021
It's not just
the pre-teens, <i>hija.</i>

1502
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,522
Anyway...

1503
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,024
I thought maybe
I'd go over there today

1504
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,527
and try to convince her
to get the party back on. You know?

1505
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,030
I don't want her
to miss her Bat Mitzvah. It'd suck.

1506
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,531
I don't think
it's your place to interfere

1507
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,034
with a mother
and her child.

1508
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,036
As I have always said,

1509
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,538
no one knows
what's in the chicken soup

1510
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,542
except the chicken
and the chef.

1511
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,043
The one thing
I agree with you on, Mom.

1512
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,544
Well, then let it be.

1513
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,047
Let those two figure out
what their differences are

1514
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:44,049
before you stick your beak
into their business.

1515
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,554
Easier said than done,
don't you think?

1516
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,557
Nobody likes
a sticky beak, Lexita.

1517
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,559
Let them worry about
their problems,

1518
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,561
and you worry
about yours.

1519
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,066
Well...

1520
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,567
if that's the way
you feel,

1521
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,571
then I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

1522
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,073
Oh, oh, no, no,
<i>un momento,</i> please.

1523
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,574
Uh, you know what?
That's-- that's no worries.

1524
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,077
No, no, no-- oh, please,
Lexit<i>mira.</i>

1525
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,578
It's just that I have
been waiting

1526
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,080
so long for this moment--

1527
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,581
Tell me about it.

1528
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,584
Okay, I'm sorry, sit down.

1529
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,589
Talk to me-- what is it
you want to tell me?

1530
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:26,591
Okay.
Ahem.

1531
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,093
All right, okay.

1532
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,095
- In going with your-- Mom.
- What?

1533
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,600
In using your analogy
with the soup to the chef...

1534
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,104
I was the chef,

1535
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,108
and Daniel was the big,
fat, cheating chicken.

1536
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:44,609
Lexita.

1537
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,612
You know you never
speak ill of the dead.

1538
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,115
- You know better than that.
- Speak ill?

1539
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,118
I'm-- I'm trying to tell you
that he made himself out

1540
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:54,619
to be something
that he wasn't.

1541
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,122
Smoke and mirrors, Mom.

1542
01:12:57,122 --> 01:13:00,125
He cheated,
lied about everything, okay?

1543
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,126
He lied about our savings.

1544
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,128
he lied about
his successful business.

1545
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,630
When he died,
he left me with nothing.

1546
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,633
Absolutely nothing.

1547
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,134
$4 hair dye.

1548
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,635
Well, regardless,

1549
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,139
you never talk about someone
who cannot defend themselves.

1550
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,141
Okay, see, I knew
this was a bad idea.

1551
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,143
Somehow, you would spin it
around on me,

1552
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:20,145
but so much for
the mother and daughter talk.

1553
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:21,646
I'm just hoping
that Mrs. Wasserstein

1554
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,148
isn't as closed-minded
as you

1555
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:27,152
or else Shari
is screwed for life.

1556
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,653
( sighs )

1557
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,659
It was a risk,
but at least you tried.

1558
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,661
Alexis:
I told you, Dad.

1559
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,669
( chatter )

1560
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:22,207
Hey! Hey!
Weird! Right?

1561
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:23,208
What are you doing here?

1562
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,712
Hey, look, I'm not
the enemy, all right?

1563
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,214
I mean, I know you don't
wanna talk to your mom, but you could talk to me.

1564
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,717
Sorry, I just don't
wanna talk about it, okay?

1565
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:33,719
Totally.

1566
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,220
Totally, I get it.

1567
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:38,223
Um... so, uh--

1568
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,725
so I saw
that you got a number.

1569
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,727
- Huh?
- What?

1570
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,729
Well, that boy
over there, and--

1571
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,731
and I saw him
pass you a note.

1572
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,733
I-- I assumed
it was digits.

1573
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:48,734
Sorry.

1574
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,235
Are you stalking me?

1575
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:52,737
No! Oh, God, no!
No, no, no! No need to run!

1576
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,740
Look, I mean,
I was running before. That's why I'm so sweaty.

1577
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,243
I was just doing a jog,
and, you know, poof! Here you were.

1578
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,245
So... yeah.

1579
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:03,248
Okay, well,
good seeing you, I guess.

1580
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,749
Well, I mean,
seeing that we're here,

1581
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,753
you might as well
show me that mysterious, taboo dress of yours.

1582
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,255
Look, I get what
you're trying to do,

1583
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,258
but there's no way you're gonna
get me to change my mind.

1584
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:15,260
My mom and I won't
even agree to disagree,

1585
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,761
and that's just the way
it is.

1586
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,764
I'm so not going
to lose sleep over it.

1587
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,265
Oh, wait, but you will.

1588
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:26,271
Eventually--
I mean, it's just years.

1589
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,773
I'm not sleeping, so--

1590
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,275
look, you don't even
have to try it on.

1591
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,781
I was going
to return it tomorrow,

1592
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,284
but it sure is pretty.

1593
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,286
I guess I can
show it to you.

1594
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,787
Great, awesome, yay.

1595
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,302
( gasps )

1596
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,803
It's so pretty.

1597
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,806
- You think?
- Yes.

1598
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,808
Oh, it would be a shame
not to wear it.

1599
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,309
I mean, at least once,

1600
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,810
in front of
all your best friends.

1601
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,813
Just think about how crazy
jealous they'd be.

1602
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,315
They'd be insanely jealous.

1603
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:11,316
I know.

1604
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,318
You gotta try it on,
you must.

1605
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,819
<i>Yeah.</i>

1606
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:22,827
Just like my sister.

1607
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,336
( chuckles )

1608
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,341
( gasps )

1609
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,843
Total "Princess Diaries."

1610
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,846
Turn.

1611
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,847
Yeah.

1612
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,849
I love it.

1613
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:47,352
Uh, what--
what happened?

1614
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:49,354
Hey, no, no, no, no,
what happened?

1615
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,356
No... what happened?

1616
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,858
What happened to the happy?
We were so happy?

1617
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:54,860
I don't know.

1618
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,861
I just don't wanna spend
the entire night

1619
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,864
worrying about what
my mother is spending

1620
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,366
the entire night
worrying about.

1621
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:02,367
You know what I mean?

1622
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,371
I wish I didn't,
but I do, kiddo.

1623
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:08,873
I mean, I would have
chosen another dress,

1624
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,876
but I really like
this one.

1625
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,879
That's because it's perfect.

1626
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,881
And, um...

1627
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,384
maybe we can just adjust it
to make your mother happy.

1628
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:20,885
Not likely.

1629
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:24,890
Woo-hoo, Shari, I'm back
from my Botox luncheon!

1630
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,393
Would you get
that look off your face?

1631
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:30,395
You look more surprised
than I do.

1632
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:33,398
( sighs )
Shari, I thought we discussed that dress.

1633
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,900
Now, go take it off.

1634
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:36,902
I think she looks
awesome in it.

1635
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,404
Well, have you taken
a gander at her knees?

1636
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,906
I mean, please,
let's be honest.

1637
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:45,910
Mrs. Wasserstein,
with all due respect,

1638
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,412
she's your daughter.

1639
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:48,413
Oh, I'm aware.

1640
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:52,417
37 hours in labor,
four hours tummy tucking.

1641
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,919
It's not something
you forget that quickly. I'm just saying.

1642
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,922
I thought she was adopted.

1643
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,423
What?
( laughs )

1644
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:00,425
I said "labor."

1645
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:01,926
I meant "laser."

1646
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,428
I had a little laser
freshening up.

1647
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:04,929
You know,
I wanted to be fabulous

1648
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,432
for the unveiling
of the baby.

1649
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:08,933
Right.

1650
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,938
Did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's okay with the way she looks?

1651
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,941
Alexis, she's a teenager.
They're never okay with the way they look

1652
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,943
<i>and some of them</i>
<i>for good reason.</i>

1653
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,445
You know,
I'm not one to stick my beak

1654
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,947
where it doesn't belong,
but you can quite possibly

1655
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,450
be making it worse by calling
attention to her shortcomings.

1656
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,955
( laughs )
Alexis, it's obvious that you're not a mom.

1657
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,958
Do you have any idea
what it's like for the--

1658
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,460
for the teenagers of today,
for the kids of today

1659
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,961
with all
the bullying going on?

1660
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,964
Well, mothers can be
bullies too.

1661
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,467
( sighs )
Alexis, I am just trying to prepare her

1662
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,469
for the real world
in my way.

1663
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:47,472
It's called
good parenting.

1664
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,475
Okay.
If I may.

1665
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:54,479
This could possibly be
the lowest point in my life.

1666
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,482
But, I am begging you,
begging you, to let her wear that dress.

1667
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,484
I mean, she likes it,
okay?

1668
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:00,985
<i>She wants it,</i>
<i>she's happy in it.</i>

1669
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,989
Before you walked in,
she was spinning!

1670
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,991
And not to mention,

1671
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,493
I really need
this to happen.

1672
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:12,497
I can't go back to L.A.,
I have absolutely nothing left there for me.

1673
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:14,999
I know, I know I'm not
a mother, but I have one.

1674
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,502
And I will bet just
about anything

1675
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,504
that all she wants is a
little love and approval.

1676
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,005
So, what do you say, huh?

1677
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:24,009
Please?

1678
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,510
My dear Alexis,

1679
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,514
I had no idea you
were this damaged.

1680
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:32,517
Ooh!

1681
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:35,520
Don't take this
moment away from her.

1682
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,522
Okay, over a dress?

1683
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,023
I promise you
it's not worth it.

1684
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,525
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1685
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,527
Listen.

1686
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:45,530
I think what you really
need to concentrate on

1687
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,031
is getting laid.

1688
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,534
Because it is a much
more rewarding release

1689
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,537
than sticking your beak
into other people's business.

1690
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,041
What if I added some
ruffles around the trim?

1691
01:19:56,041 --> 01:20:00,045
It will cover my knees,
and that way, it's a win-win for all of us.

1692
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,547
Yes! Boom!
Yeah!

1693
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:03,548
They're just knees.

1694
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,049
Good thinking,
yes!

1695
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,052
Yeah, and anyway,
you've gotta feel good

1696
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,554
about the fact that
they don't come from your side of the family.

1697
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,055
( sighs )
Well...

1698
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,558
that might make me feel
a little bit better.

1699
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,059
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

1700
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,562
I will consider it.

1701
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,564
Okay?

1702
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,566
So, we're back on?

1703
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,067
I can keep planning?

1704
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:26,071
Yeah, but don't
think for one second

1705
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,572
that if I didn't
have more time,

1706
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,073
you wouldn't
be replaced.

1707
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,075
I'm late.

1708
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,111
Of course,
noted!

Ahem. Well, um...

1751
01:22:54,753 --> 01:22:56,254
so, you know
how they say

1752
01:22:56,254 --> 01:22:58,256
that there are those people
who star in your life,

1753
01:22:58,256 --> 01:23:00,258
and those that are
just background extras?

1754
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,262
No.

1755
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:05,763
Oh.

1756
01:23:06,264 --> 01:23:09,767
Well, that's what
they say.

1757
01:23:09,768 --> 01:23:11,269
But, what I'm
trying to say

1758
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:15,773
is that my ex is--
is just that.

1759
01:23:15,774 --> 01:23:19,277
An extra,
in the background,

1760
01:23:19,778 --> 01:23:22,280
like-- like noise.

1761
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,782
Dead air,
to be exact.

1762
01:23:24,783 --> 01:23:27,786
Okay, yeah, well, she did
not look like dead air.

1763
01:23:28,286 --> 01:23:30,788
She looked quite alive
and comfortable

1764
01:23:30,789 --> 01:23:34,793
<i>in her spandex.</i>
<i>- Yeah, about that.</i>

1765
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,795
She's shooting a film,

1766
01:23:36,795 --> 01:23:39,297
and she offered
me a crumb.

1767
01:23:39,297 --> 01:23:42,300
Which, I might add,
I'm not biting.

1768
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,303
Because I'm honestly
done with all that.

1769
01:23:45,303 --> 01:23:47,805
I'm not looking to make
a sequel of that drama.

1770
01:23:50,809 --> 01:23:53,812
Really?
'Cause, um,

1771
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:55,814
what was all that talk
about her leaving Jason,

1772
01:23:55,814 --> 01:23:57,816
you know, and you guys
getting back together?

1773
01:23:57,816 --> 01:24:00,819
It's just acting.

1774
01:24:00,819 --> 01:24:04,322
Just running lines,
that's it.

1775
01:24:04,322 --> 01:24:06,324
She wanted me to
audition for this role

1776
01:24:06,324 --> 01:24:08,826
'cause she thought it might
get me back in the game.

1777
01:24:08,827 --> 01:24:10,829
And for a nanosecond,
I thought,

1778
01:24:10,829 --> 01:24:14,332
I might still want it.

1779
01:24:14,332 --> 01:24:16,334
The acting,
that is.

1780
01:24:18,837 --> 01:24:22,340
But-- but I don't.

1781
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,342
And that's where
you come in.

1782
01:24:26,344 --> 01:24:27,845
Really?

1783
01:24:29,347 --> 01:24:32,350
Yeah,
it's weird.

1784
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,353
But, for some reason,

1785
01:24:35,353 --> 01:24:37,355
not knowing you
a whole lot

1786
01:24:37,355 --> 01:24:39,357
doesn't matter.

1787
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:43,862
'Cause you just fit the part,
you know what I'm saying?

1788
01:24:43,862 --> 01:24:45,864
No.

1789
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:48,366
I never really
fit the part.

1790
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:52,370
Probably why I got kicked
out of Hebrew school.

1791
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,372
Well, that, and punching
Jessica Katz in the throat

1792
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:56,374
for saying I was
adopted from Vietnam.

1793
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:59,877
- I gave it to her good.
- Were you?

1794
01:25:06,384 --> 01:25:09,387
( sighs )

1795
01:25:09,387 --> 01:25:11,889
And, they're fake.

1796
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,892
Well, at least
they don't die.

1797
01:25:13,892 --> 01:25:16,895
Just need a little dusting
from time to time.

1798
01:25:16,895 --> 01:25:19,898
- Yeah, well,
I don't dust. - I do.

1799
01:25:19,898 --> 01:25:22,400
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

1800
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:24,903
- ( whispering )
Are you gonna kiss me? - Mm-hmm.

1801
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:26,905
Okay, well, then,
I think you should.

1802
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:43,922
Oh, lovely,
thank you so much.

1803
01:25:43,922 --> 01:25:46,925
- Da-da-da-da!
- ( gasps ) You look amazing.

1804
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:48,426
Oh, my God,
thank you!

1805
01:25:48,426 --> 01:25:49,427
Getting it together!

1806
01:25:49,427 --> 01:25:51,929
I know, even though clearly
this is a knock off.

1807
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:54,432
All right, tall order,
small budget.

1808
01:25:54,432 --> 01:25:56,434
- This is what you get.
- Thank you, Jude.

1809
01:25:56,434 --> 01:25:58,436
Regardless, do not spill
anything on it, okay?

1810
01:25:58,436 --> 01:26:01,939
- 'Cause it's rental.
- Damn it, I knew it!

1811
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,441
Hey, will you do
me a favor and just

1812
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:05,443
hold down the floor
for a second?

1813
01:26:05,443 --> 01:26:06,444
I gotta handle something,
I'll be right back.

1814
01:26:06,444 --> 01:26:07,945
- You know it.
- All right, thank you.

1815
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:10,949
By the way,
looking pretty sexy Lexi today.

1816
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:12,450
Stop it.

1817
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:15,453
See, if Superman could
come back from the dead, so could you.

1818
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:16,954
- That wasn't--
- That's a compliment.

1819
01:26:16,955 --> 01:26:18,957
- Didn't feel like one.
- It is a compliment!

1820
01:26:18,957 --> 01:26:21,960
Mm!
Mm!

1821
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,964
I would compliment that.
Any time you like.

1822
01:26:26,965 --> 01:26:29,467
Louis...

1823
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:31,969
I need to go
save some lives.

1824
01:26:57,996 --> 01:26:59,497
( exhales sharply )

1825
01:27:09,507 --> 01:27:11,008
I can do this.

1826
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:15,513
<i>( door opens )</i>

1827
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:24,022
I wish you would
have told me sooner.

1828
01:27:26,524 --> 01:27:28,025
Did Dad send you?

1829
01:27:28,026 --> 01:27:30,028
No.

1830
01:27:30,028 --> 01:27:33,031
I came to talk
on my own.

1831
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:36,034
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

1832
01:27:37,535 --> 01:27:39,537
And surrender my pride?

1833
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:43,041
I should have known
something was wrong

1834
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,042
with your marriage
when you started

1835
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:45,543
gaining all that weight.

1836
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:48,046
I'm gonna assume that
that came from a good place.

1837
01:27:48,046 --> 01:27:51,049
<i>Ay mija.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

1838
01:27:51,049 --> 01:27:53,551
I never meant for you
to question that.

1839
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:59,557
( sighs )
<i>Mira</i>    Lexita, I--

1840
01:27:59,557 --> 01:28:01,058
maybe I didn't give
you the guidance

1841
01:28:01,059 --> 01:28:04,562
and the support
that you wanted.

1842
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:08,566
But, I-- I gave you
what I knew how to give.

1843
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:12,070
( speaks Spanish )

1844
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:15,573
I know, Mom.

1845
01:28:15,573 --> 01:28:17,074
( sighs )

1846
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:22,079
You look beautiful.

1847
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:27,585
- You think so?
- I know so.

1848
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,592
Good luck
out there.

1849
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:49,106
( sighs )

1850
01:28:49,607 --> 01:28:51,609
Ooh.

1851
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:59,250
All right, so...

1852
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,252
okay, let's scooch in
a little over here.

1853
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:03,754
Starman, if you come up
a little bit, thank you.

1854
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,256
Okay, ready?

1855
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:08,759
Very nice, very nice.

1856
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,261
Nice Yamaka.

1857
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,263
Thank you.

1858
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,265
You guys look
incredible.

1859
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:15,266
Thanks.

1860
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:16,768
You look pretty
good yourself.

1861
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,269
Thank you.

1862
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:19,770
You do
clean up well.

1863
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,272
Oh, that was a
little backhanded,

1864
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,274
but I'll take it
from you.

1865
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:24,275
Do you wanna come with
me to the loading dock

1866
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:26,277
to pick up our
guest of honor, please?

1867
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:27,778
Sure, sure.

1868
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,280
Hey Memo, I'll be back
in just a minute.

1869
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,281

1870
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:31,783
- Okay.
- All right.

1871
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,785
You're it.
No tag backs.

1872
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,789
...right around
the corner, but--

1873
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,290
Oh!

1874
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,293
Yeah, so, Casey sends
her sincerest apologies.

1875
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:45,296
But, the monkey she
booked for you guys

1876
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:47,798
got booked to play
Abu in "Aladdin".

1877
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,300
On Broadway, hm.

1878
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,802
So, she sent Mookie
to take his place.

1879
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,805
I'll be back at
5:00 to pick him up.

1880
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,307
Okay, uh, Mookie's
not a monkey.

1881
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:58,809
Oh, what makes
you say that?

1882
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,316
He's not a monkey,
but he's, uh...

1883
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,318
he's cute.

1884
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:08,819

01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,821
<i>( Alexis sighs )</i>

1886
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:13,824
That man was
kinda creepy, right?

1887
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,326
- Yeah, definitely creepy.
- Yeah?

1888
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,827
- Okay.
- Fat chance.

1889
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,329
Ta-da!

1890
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:21,332
Ta-da,
not a monkey!

1891
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:23,334
All right, tall order,
small budget.

1892
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:25,336
- This is what you get.
- Yeah, yeah.

1893
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,338
You get a small
South American rodent.

1894
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:30,341
You know, I really don't
think Shari will be able to tell the difference.

1895
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:33,344
Oh, isn't he cute?
But it does not take a rocket scientist

1896
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,846
to see that is
definitely not a monkey.

1897
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:36,848
Memo:
Not a monkey at all.

1898
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,350
Oh, my God.
Monkey!

1899
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,852
Mom, look!
He's awesome!

1900
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:43,854
You guys rock.

1901
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,356
You totally
saved my day.

1902
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:46,857
That's what we
are here for.

1903
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:49,360
- Oh!
- Oh, Lord, Lord!

1904
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,362
You got him?

1905
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,863
- There you go.
- Mm!

1906
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,366
- Okay.
- All right!

1907
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,368
So, maybe she's in
special ed.

1908
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:59,370
That, we're not
gonna say again.

1909
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,871
- Oh.
- You know, maybe I should

1910
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,374
go and take some pictures
of her with the rodent.

1911
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:04,875
All right,
just, ahem,

1912
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,377
photograph her
from the waist up.

1913
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:07,878
Just go waist up.

1914
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,380
( laughing )

1915
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:12,383
Alexis:
Awesome.

1916
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:15,386
Nice job.

1917
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,388
I see you took a little
bit of my advice

1918
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:19,390
and got yourself
a piece of man candy.

1919
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,892
- Oh!
- Bravo!

1920
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:22,894
Excuse me, honey,

1921
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:26,397
but can you escort
me to the latrine?

1922
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:29,900
I may need
your assistance.

1923
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,903
( laughs )

1924
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,405
Whee!

1925
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,910
And suddenly,
it's all so clear.

1926
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,411
Like a crystal.

1927
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,413

What do you have here?

at a Bat Mitzvah?

Ew!

1935
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,931

No, woman,
it is for you!

1937
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:04,435

wants you to call her

surprise 60th birthday party!

- Get it, get it.

01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,441
No, burn it!

1941
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:12,443

- Never.
