1
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,960
Here you go, sir.

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,880
You're looking great today,
Mr Hanson.

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,320
All right, people,
twenty seconds to air.

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,000
Fifteen seconds. Where's Lorie?

5
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Five, four, three, two...

6
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,280
<i>Perkell Heating and Cooling</i>
<i>brings you He Said, She Said.</i>

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>Your commentators,</i>
<i>Lorraine Bryer and Dan Hanson.</i>

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,120
<i>The issue today, Proposition 41,</i>
<i>the highway merger.</i>

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,440
Good afternoon, Dan.

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,440
Proposition 41,
on the ballot in October,

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,600
would provide for a new connecting spur
to merge Highways 710 and 88.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,280
In my view, this merger
is long overdue.

13
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,440
It would improve access and boost
growth, especially in outlying areas.

14
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,280
I know what you'll say, Dan: Proposition
41 can wait, there's no need for it now.

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,080
But in two or three years
it will be too late.

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,800
We must go forward or we stop.
Now is the time.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,280
That's the way I see it.

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Lorie, you're
over-intellectualising again.

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,560
Common sense says we don't need
a merger. These roads are working well.

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,720
It would just add to spending, traffic and
congestion in an already crowded area.

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
And the outlying areas
that you speak of

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,960
have reached a plateau
where further growth is not expected.

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,680
There's nothing wrong
with the status quo.

24
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,400
As my Uncle Olaf used to say,
"Why fix it, if it ain't broken?"

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,360
And that's the way I see it... Ow!

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,840
Christ!

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,760
<i>Commentators' opinions are not</i>
<i>necessarily those of station WBAL.</i>

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,560
Excuse me, please. This is it.
She's gone too far this time.

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,000
- What did you do to her?
- What did I do? She went nuts on air!

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
You must have done something.

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,080
You shouldn't make
a rebuttal with a blunt object.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,240
Here, you do this,
it's too disgusting.

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,160
I hope Weller wasn't watching.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,840
It's all right, he's going to be fine.
Get back to work. Please.

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,680
Emily, find some aspirin.

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,280
Look at all those calls, Mr Thurman.
Hundreds of them.

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Vultures. Can't wait
to see what happens tomorrow.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,320
Yeah, neither can I.

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,720
Wait a minute.
They all can't wait till tomorrow.

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,040
This could be the best thing ever.

41
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,800
- If we promote this right.
- I just spoke to Weller's secretary!

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,280
You did?

43
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
This could be good. He loves
this kind of stuff. What did she say?

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,360
- She said he would call.
- Did you hear that? She said...

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,160
Wait a minute. Weller is going to be
calling me? On my phone, personally?

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
This could be bad, very bad.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,440
He only calls personally
if he wants to hurt you. We're screwed.

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Wally, sit down, relax.
You don't know what he's thinking.

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,240
- It may not be that bad.
- Not that bad?

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,280
Will he still want you after today?

51
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,520
Lorie blew the deal.

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,480
Look, I'll find Lorie,
I'll talk to her.

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,600
What do we say? He's spending
a fortune, and you break up on air.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,560
We're not breaking up.
This is how me and Lorie are.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
We always have been.

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,560
Hi, this is Lorie Bryer, I'm
with the people section of The Sun.

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,680
Yeah.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Hanson. Yes, hello.
Thanks for calling me back.

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm doing the obituary
on Professor Hollis.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,480
I was wondering,
what time is the wedding...funeral?

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Thank you. Does the family
have any special requests?

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,800
In lieu of flowers. Great.
Thanks very much. Bye.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Puce. This is definitely
Pulitzer Prize material.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,640
This will turn journalism on its ear.

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,600
No small jobs here, Miss Bryer.
A newspaper is a daily miracle.

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,760
And we're all part of it.

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
Diana.

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,960
You look incredible. It's your hair,
you found your cut, right?

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Are we still on for Friday?

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,400
It's my sister's birthday.
Make it Saturday?

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,240
Sure, absolutely. No problem.
My entire schedule is at your disposal.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
Sheila, Sheila.

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Can we change Saturday to Friday?

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,240
- It's my sister's birthday.
- Sure, Dan, I can do that.

75
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you. Thank you.

76
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
- You're an angel.
- Thanks.

77
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,840
Dan.

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,920
- Dan.
- Shit.

79
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
Dan?

80
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,600
Lousy, self-centred,
three-timing jerk.

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Scumbag. Oh, God, I fell for it.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,840
Now I find out he's got a girlfriend.

83
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,760
- You all right?
- Take my advice, stay away from him.

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,480
Never go out with him.

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,960
There's no chance of that.
I don't go out with cowardly scumbags.

86
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,360
What does everybody see in him?
He's not that good-looking.

87
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,800
He thinks he's charming
with all this boyish stuff.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,640
And I can't imagine
the sex would be any good.

89
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,440
Well...

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,880
How many Es in "sleazeball"?

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,560
A note is good, but make
a much more dramatic point!

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,440
- You ought to break something.
- Great idea.

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
One of his models.

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,440
No, the Wolfman.
That's his favourite, I think.

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,640
Oh, no. I couldn't do that.

96
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,480
Have you heard him talk about the
Wolfman? It brought tears to my eyes.

97
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,600
Look, just do me a favour, OK?

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,520
Next time you see him,
you kick his butt for me.

99
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
- You got it.
- OK.

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,040
You... Don't say a word.

101
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,600
- You told her to trash Wolfman.
- You deserve it, lying to that poor girl.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,240
Am I responsible for the personality
disorders of every girl I go out with?

103
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,720
I told Janet I see other women,
I don't lie.

104
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,720
You help old ladies
cross the street, too?

105
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,840
I happen to have
seventeen merit badges.

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,040
And by the way,
sex with me is very good.

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm sure.

108
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Why, have you heard something?
What have you heard?

109
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,960
Nothing, nothing.

110
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,680
There've been a lot of rumours since
Monroe announced his retirement.

111
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,360
So I've decided to give young
Mr Hanson here a crack at his column.

112
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,200
Congratulations.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,680
Christ, Ed! I wish you hadn't done that.

114
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,640
Dan...and Miss Bryer,
in my office after this meeting.

115
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Technically, the op-ed page
is Ed's territory.

116
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,640
But I wish he'd told me
he'd promised the column to you.

117
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,880
We've decided, in a most Solomon-like
fashion, to give you both a shot.

118
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,000
You know
the public sculpture story? Good!

119
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,880
Don't imitate Monroe.
Use your own style and opinions.

120
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,280
1,500 words on my desk
by five o'clock for publication tomorrow.

121
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,840
May the best man win...
or the best woman.

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,240
- This really sucks.
- Tell me about it.

123
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Don't tell me you're done already.
Do you think at all, or do you just type?

124
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't need to think.
Common sense tells me what to say.

125
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,840
Common sense, huh?

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,120
Tell you what: I'll wait so we can hand
them in together, to give you a fair shot.

127
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,320
So my years at journalism school
were a waste of time?

128
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,120
- I'm not a journalist.
- I wouldn't brag about it.

129
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,400
- I'm a newspaper man.
- Pithy. Dumb, but pithy.

130
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,400
- Listen...
- Listen...

131
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Go ahead.

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,320
After tomorrow, one of us will never
speak to the other again, so I...

133
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
How about dinner?

134
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,360
Here you are.

135
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
And you, sir.

136
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,720
- To my new column.
- The paper isn't out yet.

137
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,520
- Why not take the rest?
- I just wanted a taste.

138
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,680
- Dan.
- Susan.

139
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,320
Hi.

140
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,960
You look fantastic. Your hair's great.
That's you, that's your cut.

141
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you. And for the flowers.
You remembered I like 'mums.

142
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
You got them, I'm glad.
Susan, this is Lorie.

143
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,920
She's...got the cubicle
across from me.

144
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,840
I didn't mean to interrupt. Maybe
we could get together next week.

145
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,440
Great, call me. But don't
change your hair, or the deal is off.

146
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,560
- I won't. Bye-bye.
- See you.

147
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,800
- Don't say a word.
- I do not believe you, it's amazing.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,040
It's like watching
some creeping fungus at work.

149
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Believe it or not,
some people enjoy my company.

150
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,360
All I'm saying is, from what
I've observed of you and your women,

151
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,560
the level of hurt, outrage and distress
you inspire can only be termed massive.

152
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,840
- Does she look hurt to you?
- No. In fact, she looked very happy.

153
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,400
But, you know, ignorance is bliss.

154
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I just don't understand women like that.
Maybe I'm too cerebral.

155
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,480
- That means brainy.
- I know.

156
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,920
You've something on your face,
a crumb or dirt or something.

157
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,720
What are you...? Stop.

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,120
- So, public sculpture, for or against?
- What do you think?

159
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,640
- I was against.
- That doesn't surprise me!

160
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,800
They'll print yours anyway.
It's a men's club.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,680
- Come on.
- Know where I'd like to work?

162
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,520
The New York Times.

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,080
At least I could influence people there,
even change the way they think.

164
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,400
That's why I want this column.

165
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
I don't want to be stuck
reporting weddings forever.

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,440
Really? I thought
all women loved weddings.

167
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,600
You think you can get to me,
don't you?

168
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,920
All right,
if we're talking in stereotypes,

169
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,280
all women want to get married,
and all men fear commitment.

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,280
You don't understand. It's not fear.

171
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,320
We don't have a choice,
we can't commit.

172
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,800
It's deep inside, an animal instinct
that keeps us separate from the pack.

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,640
- Right, like your friend the Wolfman.
- Exactly.

174
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Perfect example: Wolfman's
a source of strength for us guys.

175
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,560
He's strong, aloof,
destined to live alone.

176
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,920
He's his own man, his own wolf.
He's his own Wolfman.

177
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,120
He knows he can't get close to anyone,
because when the moon is full...

178
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,080
Bingo! Somebody is gonna get hurt.

179
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,280
So he takes his intimacy where he can,
a night here, a night there...

180
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,280
Other women fall for this shit, huh?

181
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,440
It's not shit. I deeply believe in this.

182
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,720
Sounds like an excuse to me.

183
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,360
Sooner or later,
even the Wolfman has to choose.

184
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,400
- Ready to order, Miss?
- Oh, yes.

185
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,640
I will start with...

186
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,320
...monogamy, then commitment...

187
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,080
...and then I will have the marriage.

188
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,040
The marriage comes with commitment.

189
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,080
Unless you'd like
something on the side.

190
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,600
Oh, no, not me.
But maybe children later.

191
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
Good choice, ma'am.

192
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,280
- The monogamy is good here.
- And you, sir?

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,040
Just a side order of sex, please.

194
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,960
Sorry, sir,
it only comes with commitment.

195
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,640
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll take the complete dinner.

196
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Hold the commitment and monogamy,
bring me the sex, and we're all happy.

197
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,960
- You don't want monogamy?
- Can't you read the sign?

198
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,440
Do you need more time to decide?

199
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,200
I hear the ravioli here is great.

200
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,600
Yeah, sure. Ravioli sounds fine.

201
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,240
When I'm editor,
I'll give you another chance.

202
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,680
When you're editor, I'll be long gone.
Don't feel sorry for me.

203
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,080
- Shit!
- What's wrong?

204
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,240
My contact, it popped out.
God, I'm always doing this.

205
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,000
Hang on. I'm excellent at this.
I have an uncanny power. Watch.

206
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,640
Attention, everybody, please.
Nobody move.

207
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,360
My friend has just lost a contact lens.
So everybody just stop!

208
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,640
Just look down and...

209
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh, boy.

210
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,720
Was that it?

211
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
I don't know, I can't see.

212
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,200
We've got it.

213
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,360
Thanks. Thank you.

214
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm really sorry.

215
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,880
How am I going to drive? I'll have
to read my column with one eye.

216
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,400
What?

217
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,280
What?

218
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,840
- I'm sorry. It's just...
- What?

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,880
...funny. Don't you think it's funny?

220
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, that's stealing.

221
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,920
Wait, I just want to say,
before we look,

222
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,200
whatever happens,
I had a good time tonight.

223
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
OK.

224
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
- I don't believe it.
- Goddammit!

225
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,960
This is not fair.
Only one of us was supposed to win.

226
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,800
- It was mine in the first place.
- It's nice of them to...

227
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,120
- Nice?
- It's me who should be upset.

228
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,040
Listen, buster. The only reason
they ran yours at all is because...

229
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,600
...you have a penis.

230
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,120
Well, why didn't you show them yours?

231
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,800
Hey, forget it.
I had a terrible time tonight.

232
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,640
- Dan, good job. You showed her.
- What do you mean? She's right.

233
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,360
Did we read the same column?

234
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,680
- Hey, Phil. The usual.
- You got it.

235
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,360
You gonna stare at me all night,
or are you gonna buy me a drink?

236
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,240
And one of whatever
this young lady's having.

237
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,680
- You're the literary type, huh?
- Depends. What type do you like?

238
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,640
Oh, men about your height.
Men about your size.

239
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,040
- But we must work on the clothes.
- What's wrong with them?

240
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
They're on.

241
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,880
I've missed you.

242
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,760
- How was Paris?
- Wet.

243
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,560
Oh, Linda.
How about we get out of here?

244
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,280
Hold on, big boy, I want my drink.

245
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,280
So who's the girl? You two a team?

246
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,600
Oh, God, no. They wouldn't do that.

247
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,720
It's a one-shot deal.
I'll never have to work with her again.

248
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,600
That's what we decided.
We'll start with three columns a week.

249
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,560
I think we've got something here.
People love a good fight.

250
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,640
- That's a great line for an ad.
- All right.

251
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,520
Next job: there's a new dance thing
at the Royal.

252
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,480
- The pornographic thing.
- There's a brief nude scene.

253
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
- You've seen it?
- No, but...

254
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,120
- Is this knee-jerk liberalism?
- What about you?

255
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,600
Do it.

256
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,680
- That shouldn't be allowed.
- Who are you to say?

257
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm an average person.
If it offends me, it would most people.

258
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,240
- Let people decide for themselves.
- I just give the facts.

259
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,200
You call what you write the facts?

260
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,840
Boiling down complex issues into
pithy epigrams from your Uncle Olaf.

261
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,680
Wait a second.
Leave my Uncle Olaf out of this.

262
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,080
Give me a break. He's a cheap literary
invention. He doesn't even exist.

263
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,720
My uncle is not cheap.
I'll prove he exists. What shall we bet?

264
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I will bet you a drink.

265
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
- You're on.
- OK.

266
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,240
He's not home.

267
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,800
He has a new girlfriend.

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
- Tuesday night is polka night.
- Really?

269
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
- I'll have a gin and tonic.
- He's just not home.

270
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,840
- Do you want to dance?
- I don't dance.

271
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,240
I'll have a gin and tonic.

272
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,440
You're really good.

273
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, God.

274
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,800
I know this guy.
He's an incredible drag.

275
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,360
He's always coming on to me.

276
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,960
If he comes over and asks to dance,
will you dance with me, please?

277
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,520
Lorie... Hi, it's me, Steve.

278
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,360
I haven't seen you here in ages.
You looked great out there.

279
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,120
Excuse me, we were...

280
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,040
Do you want to dance?
I miss the way we move together.

281
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,400
Sorry, buddy, she's dancing with me.

282
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,240
- Thanks.
- It's OK.

283
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

284
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,320
Look...

285
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,800
I wanted to say the other night that...

286
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,440
...most girls' eyes don't sparkle
when they take their contacts out.

287
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,040
But yours do... I couldn't say that,
because it'd sound stupid,

288
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,560
and you'd think I was chasing you,
and I didn't want you to, because...

289
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,760
...because I was chasing you.

290
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,280
If you wanted to confuse me,
you've done a good job. I would really...

291
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
...really like to kiss you again, but...

292
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,240
...not if you're going to laugh at me.

293
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,280
I won't laugh at you.

294
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,280
- Do you want to...?
- Yes.

295
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,760
Mr Hanson.

296
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,440
Must be Wednesday.
Big order day, right?

297
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,120
Planning for the weekend.
You must spend half your salary here.

298
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,520
- I'm not complaining, though.
- Lou, just one order today.

299
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,560
- What? Only one?
- Yeah, let's see...

300
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,000
...roses, or maybe Birds of Paradise.

301
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,440
It all depends on the desired effect.

302
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,760
Breaking the ice, sexual overture...

303
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,320
Not...love?

304
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,760
Please, Mr Hanson...

305
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,360
Tell me it's not love.

306
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,280
No.

307
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,640
- I don't know.
- You know what love is?

308
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,240
It's a time bomb, waiting to go off.
Believe me.

309
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,600
That's why God made other women.

310
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,040
No matter how good
any one woman might be...

311
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,080
...there's always another one around
the corner that could be even better.

312
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,440
- You OK?
- I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm OK.

313
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,640
4.15, morning terrors. It's OK.

314
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Take some deep breaths
and come back to bed.

315
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,120
- Come on.
- You never take this seriously.

316
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,600
Doesn't this ever happen to you?

317
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,440
You wake up and don't feel real...

318
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,520
You feel you're not living the life
you're supposed to be living.

319
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,440
Like all your choices are wrong?

320
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,000
You're just tired.

321
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,800
No, I'm not tired.
You don't understand.

322
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,160
I don't love you.

323
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,760
I mean... I've known you longer
than any other woman in my life, but...

324
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,440
...I shouldn't be in bed
with somebody I don't love.

325
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,120
Do you know how often you've
woken up at 4.15 with deep insights?

326
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,080
Yeah.

327
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,080
And they're always right.

328
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,360
What are you saying?

329
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,680
I know who I should be with.

330
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,040
And I only want to go to bed with her.

331
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm sorry, Linda.

332
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
Dan...

333
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,080
You know this woman,
the one you're dumping me for?

334
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,480
She isn't worth it.

335
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,000
How long have you been here?

337
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,960
A while.

338
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,480
I brought you some orange juice
and doughnuts.

339
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,800
But I ate the doughnuts.

340
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,760
Look...

341
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,000
I only want to be with you, and I don't
want you to be with anyone else but me.

342
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,320
Please say something.

343
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,880
That's how it began.

344
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,520
Wait a minute, back up.
This Linda, is this Linda Metzger?

345
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,400
- You slept with her?
- You know her?

346
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Of course. I tried to sleep with her
all through college.

347
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,280
- How did you meet?
- Well...

348
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,120
Hold on, which life story do you want?

349
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,480
I made a promo for tomorrow's show.
It's great.

350
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,880
Hi, Dan, how's the head?
She got you pretty good, huh?

351
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,160
I slowed it down and transferred it.
You can see the lettering on the mug.

352
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,160
As my Uncle Olaf used to say,
"Why fix it, if it ain't broken?"

353
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,280
And that's the way I see it... Ow!

354
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,480
<i>You never know what's going to be</i>
<i>tossed around on He Said, She Said.</i>

355
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,080
<i>See Hanson and Bryer, Round Two,</i>
<i>tomorrow at noon on Channel 11.</i>

356
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,320
- The way it spins around...
- I think I gotta lie down again.

357
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,800
Mr Thurman, it's him.
Bill Weller on one.

358
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,280
Jesus.

359
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,680
Hello, this is Wallace Thurman,
station manager at WBAL.

360
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,600
It's a pleasure
to be speaking to you directly.

361
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,720
Hanson and Bryer. No problem, sir.
Just a moment.

362
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,440
He wants you <i>and</i> Lorie
on the speakerphone.

363
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,760
Put him on, I'll improvise.

364
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,920
One problem:
I've never used the speakerphone.

365
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
- Thanks.
<i>- Who's there?</i>

366
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,920
Hello, this is Dan Hanson.
I'm here with Wally Thurman.

367
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,240
- And this is Ray, our technical director.
- Lorie Bryer is in the bathroom.

368
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,000
<i>Can't be helped, I guess.</i>
<i>Let me cut to the chase.</i>

369
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,200
<i>- I'm buying your crummy little show.</i>
- We know, sir...

370
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,440
<i>That stunt you pulled, Hanson,</i>
<i>you and Miss Bryer...</i>

371
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,360
<i>That was pure magic</i>
<i>for enhancing ratings.</i>

372
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,320
<i>I don't care if you hate each other</i>
<i>or if you faked it.</i>

373
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,960
<i>You just milk this situation</i>
<i>for every nickel it's worth.</i>

374
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,680
We're excited that you're excited.

375
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,600
<i>- I'm not excited, I'm greedy.</i>
- Greed is good.

376
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,720
<i>I'm greedy and determined.</i>

377
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,320
<i>To make sure it goes well,</i>
<i>I'll be there for tomorrow's show.</i>

378
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,160
<i>Don't screw up.</i>

379
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,320
- Come back, it was a mistake.
- He's gone.

380
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,360
What...? Oh.

381
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,920
Come on.

382
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
This is ridiculous.

383
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,160
Lorie... Lorie, honey.
Come on, open up.

384
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,760
Lorie, what's going on?

385
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,680
Lorie, I know you're in there.
Please, honey, talk to me.

386
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,840
I brought you some of Rita's slaw.

387
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,280
- Take it away.
- Come on.

388
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,120
- I hate it.
- I thought you liked it.

389
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,440
- I was just being polite.
- For three years?

390
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,640
- Go away.
- What? I live here!

391
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,560
Not any more.

392
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,160
How's your head?

393
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,480
It hurts, it's bleeding.
I might need stitches.

394
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,200
I'm sorry, I just couldn't
take it any more.

395
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,520
Looking up at your fat, smug face,
I couldn't help myself.

396
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,760
Thanks, honey.
That's quite an apology.

397
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,160
Why is my stuff in the hall?
What does it mean?

398
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,520
It means it took this whole TV thing,

399
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,720
the show and its success
and what it's done to us...

400
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,280
...to make me realise
that we want different things.

401
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,560
I've always known that, but...

402
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,840
...I kept thinking that some day
it would get easier...

403
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,920
...but I don't think
you're ever going to change.

404
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,800
Wait a minute.
Things are going great for us.

405
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,320
We can't split over one fight.
There's too much at stake.

406
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,360
Honey, please.
I don't want it to be over.

407
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,680
You used to like me the way I was.

408
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,120
I still do.

409
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
I love you.

410
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,800
But I need more from you.

411
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,320
Well, I just don't know
what else I can give you.

412
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,720
Well...

413
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,000
Is that Rita's coleslaw?

414
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,920
- Yeah. Do you want it?
- Yeah.

415
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,280
- Hold on, I'll bring it down.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

416
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,760
Here...

417
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,520
I'll give you a dollar. It's only fair.

418
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,240
- And come on in. You look like shit.
- OK. Thanks.

419
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,400
Oh, so there he is.

420
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,920
- Hi, Mrs Spepk.
- Sit down.

421
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,000
- I'll get something for your head.
- Thanks...

422
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,920
...but a bump is not the problem.

423
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,960
I know what the problem is.

424
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,320
You see, in my day, young people got
married before they slept together.

425
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,480
Bullshit. We slept together
before we were married.

426
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,880
We did not. And you didn't marry
for love back then, either.

427
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,720
- Love came later.
- I'm still waiting.

428
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,080
Thank you very much, Mrs Spepk,
Mr Spepk. But I've really got to go.

429
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,200
You've done it this time,
she wants me to change the locks.

430
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,240
You're kidding.
She asked you to do that?

431
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,960
You won't be breaking
any more windows.

432
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,200
- What do you mean?
- Remember the window you broke?

433
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,080
- Yes, but I didn't break it.
- You did, don't you remember?

434
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,360
I did not break that window. Lorie did.

435
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,480
- Wake up.
- What are you doing?

436
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,920
We have to get out.
The room is flooding.

437
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,760
- It's not flooding.
- I got you a raincoat.

438
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,120
Thanks. You're sleeping.
Come on, let's go back to bed.

439
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,400
- We have to leave.
- I know, we will...

440
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,080
But not right now.
I'll call a cab, a gondola.

441
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,400
When you wake up, he'll be here. OK?

442
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,480
- All right.
- Good.

443
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,960
Don't forget your raincoat.

444
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,920
No, I won't. Just go to sleep now.

445
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,720
No, I do not sleepwalk.
Other people would have told me.

446
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,640
- You're not my first overnight guest.
- Did the windows break themselves?

447
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,640
- Pick-up for Hanson.
- Two pastramis on rye?

448
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,320
That's it.

449
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,440
Hey, you're that guy.
I've seen your picture.

450
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,840
And you. You two...
No! Get out of here.

451
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,280
Rita, come see who's here.

452
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,400
I've got to get a picture
for my wall of fame.

453
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,920
- Rita.
- I heard you before, Pop.

454
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,320
Look who's here.
It's the people who argue.

455
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,640
And guess what, they're in love.

456
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,760
Wow. It's really nice to meet you.
I love your column.

457
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,600
- Thank you.
- Hold these up for the camera.

458
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,080
Step back over there.
Hold 'em up real nice and high.

459
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,960
Smile big. Yeah.

460
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,800
Wait a minute.
Look at that. Hold this.

461
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,960
Hey, look what I got!

462
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,160
You're beautiful!

463
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,120
- Hey.
- What?

464
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,560
I love you.

465
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,520
I'm not telling you this to get
the exact same response from you.

466
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,040
I feel very warmly towards you,

467
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,480
and I think it's great...

468
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,560
...that you're not asking me to be
exactly where you are right now.

469
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,960
OK, I only know your side of the story,
I haven't treated Lorie yet,

470
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,560
but I know you well enough to know...

471
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,920
...that any concerns that
she has about you are justified.

472
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
Verbalisation's the key here.

473
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,240
In order to achieve a mature,
empathic resonance with your partner,

474
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,920
you've got to share your feelings.

475
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
I know, that's why I'm here.

476
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,320
Now. We have had
tremendous results...

477
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,440
...real breakthroughs...

478
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,440
...with these.

479
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,440
Eric, that's a puppet.

480
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,960
My clients express their feelings
without becoming too vulnerable.

481
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,320
We call them emotional surrogates.

482
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,080
I love you, Dan.

483
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,880
I love you.

484
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,560
- Come on, you try.
- I really don't want to.

485
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,080
Come on.

486
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,720
- I feel ridiculous.
- Come on.

487
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,520
I can't.

488
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,520
God.

489
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,880
Dan.

490
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,760
It's OK, honey. I'm OK.

491
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,240
Dan?

492
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,480
I think I'd like some cheesecake.

493
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
What?

494
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,920
I think you could use some, too.

495
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

496
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,600
- I could definitely use some.
- OK.

497
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,840
You're not going to remember
any of this, are you?

498
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,680
Lorie? I love you.

499
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,800
I'm crazy about you.
Don't ever leave me, please.

500
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,640
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

501
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,560
I'll go get us some cheesecake.

502
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,360
I just want to warn you.

503
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,680
Daddy won't approve of you,
but Mom is sweet, very sweet.

504
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,000
It's so great that you're
taking time off to come.

505
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,720
I wanted to meet them, it's time I did.

506
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,320
Why? What does that mean?

507
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,520
Nothing.
I mean it's just about time I met them.

508
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
- That's all.
- Don't be nervous.

509
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,320
They're very normal. They're
the most normal family in the world.

510
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,480
You just can't discuss birth control
out of its political context.

511
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,080
I use a diaphragm. That doesn't
make me a capitalist, or a socialist.

512
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,560
Diaphragms are threatening.
They give women power.

513
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,520
I've used condoms all my life. I'm not
ashamed of it. How about you, Dan?

514
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,840
- Do you use condoms?
- Well, actually, it kind of depends.

515
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,520
He's got condom written all over him.

516
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,520
What does your father do, Dan?

517
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,640
- I think they're too old for that.
- I meant for a living.

518
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,680
- Oh, he's retired.
- Independently wealthy, huh?

519
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,560
No, just old.
I was a late kid. A surprise.

520
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,320
You like children, Dan?

521
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,920
- Yeah. I mean, yeah. Well, yeah...
- Where's Wendy?

522
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:34,320
Oh, she read Dan's abortion article
and decided she couldn't eat with him.

523
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,960
- That's rude.
- I don't think so.

524
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
- What about capital punishment, Dan?
- This isn't the time...

525
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,960
All right. He's for capital punishment,
he voted for Reagan twice.

526
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,160
He makes slightly more than me
for the same job,

527
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,520
and we usually use
a Sheik Elite with a reservoir tip.

528
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,600
- Anything else?
- We're just getting to know him.

529
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,800
It's not like we're getting married
or anything, is it?

530
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
No. I mean, no.

531
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,560
I mean no. No.

532
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,880
Good morning.
Welcome to A.M. Baltimore.

533
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,360
Our guests today
are Dan Hanson and Lorie Bryer,

534
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,000
two columnists
from the Baltimore Sun,

535
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,240
whose competing columns
have caused quite a stir.

536
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,400
Good morning. Were you surprised
by the success of your columns?

537
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,000
- Well, no, actually...
- I...

538
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
Sorry, go ahead.

539
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,240
I wonder if people would
notice what we were saying...

540
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,440
...if they were normal editorials,
without this competition thing.

541
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,960
We're getting read, that's the important
thing. We make people think.

542
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,120
Maybe. But is it what we say,
or is it just a gimmick?

543
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,360
Do you two ever stop arguing?

544
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,680
Tell us if this is right... We've heard
that you two are living together.

545
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,040
Well, I'd rather not go into that.

546
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,400
Not yet. Let me put it that way.

547
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,240
Isn't that great?

548
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,760
Why did that upset you so much?

549
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,200
What is this "not yet" stuff?

550
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,760
We've talked about moving in.

551
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,280
No. <i>I</i> have been talking about it,
<i>you</i> have been ignoring me.

552
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,080
Does that mean you want to move in?

553
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,960
Well, we need to talk about it.

554
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,720
That is such prime
Dan Hanson material.

555
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,760
Do we talk about it at home alone,

556
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,600
or in front of 500,000 people
we don't know?

557
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,680
Come on. That show doesn't get
500,000 viewers, does it?

558
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
You're impossible. Impossible.

559
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,160
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

560
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm Wally Thurman,
the station manager.

561
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,360
- Hi.
- You two are both terrific.

562
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
- Thank you.
- Terrific together.

563
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,200
As a team.

564
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,840
Have you ever considered
being on TV regularly?

565
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,280
- Yes. No.
- No. Yes.

566
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,880
Well, actually, we do talk about it,

567
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,600
we feel it's a natural evolution
of what we've been doing.

568
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:28,200
<i>Stand by, please.</i>
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

569
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,000
- Hi. I'm Dan Hanson.
- And I'm Lorie Bryer.

570
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,840
- And this is <i>He Said...</i>
<i>- ...She Said.</i>

571
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,280
Today's issue is garbage. Our dumps
will be full in 10 years, what then?

572
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,560
Some people feel it's the government's
responsibility, and maybe they're right.

573
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,960
But as my Uncle Olaf says,
"You make the trash, you take it out."

574
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,480
And that's the way I see it.

575
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,480
- You were great.
- No, you were.

576
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,240
You even made me look good.

577
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,280
Let's do it. Let's move in together.

578
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,040
Hey, Larry.

579
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,080
I'll consider this relationship a success
when you clean your coffee cup.

580
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,320
- What shall we do today?
- I don't know...

581
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,200
I thought we'd stay in.

582
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
<i>Hey, Dan!</i>

583
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,240
- Hey, guys.
- Three on three in the park.

584
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,720
Yeah.

585
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,840
Actually, I'm just going
to stay in today. Thanks.

586
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,680
- Oh, man, let's go.
- What a baby!

587
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,800
Oh, hi, Dan. How are you today?

588
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,280
I'm fine...
but I'm gonna stay in.

589
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,640
Linda?

590
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,880
Dan, hurry up.
Come on, you're missing the party.

591
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,920
I'll be right down.

592
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,400
You know...

593
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,080
...I definitely think
we should stay in today.

594
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Whatever you say.

595
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,360
I didn't change enough? Oh, come on.
I changed everything in my life for her.

596
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,960
You're better off.

597
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,560
The things I could have done
if I didn't have to come home to her.

598
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,680
- What things?
- How should I know, I didn't do them.

599
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,760
All right. You, enough of this.

600
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,000
You go up there right now.

601
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,680
Take her in your arms
and tell her you love her.

602
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,800
No, it's too late, Mrs Spepk.
This is it. It's over.

603
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,280
- Dan, you can't be serious.
- Mr Spepk...

604
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,680
Here's my keys. Tell Lorie
there's no need to change the locks.

605
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,040
Here, take this.

606
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,720
Thanks.

607
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,280
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi.

608
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,760
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

609
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,080
- Wally called. He told me all about it.
- Wow! News travels fast.

610
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,520
Boy, you look great.
It's really good to see you.

611
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,920
- Maybe we shouldn't sit here.
- Why?

612
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,600
What's the difference? Never mind.

613
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,840
- So you know Wally?
- Yes. He's been chasing me forever.

614
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,600
- Almost as long as you.
- I never chased you.

615
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,840
You never had to.

616
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,240
Wally asked me to try
to get you two back together.

617
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,480
- What did you say?
- I said I'd try real hard, for the show.

618
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,640
One problem:
the show is not available any more.

619
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,280
- So you are, right?
- They don't want me single.

620
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,240
I'm not as picky.

621
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,840
- Got a place to stay?
- Well, actually...

622
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,280
My company put me in a suite hotel.

623
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,040
I have a sofa and an extra room.

624
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,840
- I'd love you to stay with me.
- Dan.

625
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,880
- Oh, Mark, hi.
- How's the wound?

626
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,000
It's...OK.

627
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,480
Yeah.

628
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,240
Well, I've got to get back, so...

629
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,400
See you.

630
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,680
- So what happened this morning?
- All right. I was in the green room...

631
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,280
- Why is this called the green room?
- I don't know.

632
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,240
Probably some theatrical tradition.

633
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,560
Something to do with Shakespeare,
or something.

634
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,360
- Oh, Christ, Lorie.
- What?

635
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,080
Your cup. Your goddamned cup.

636
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,120
So...

637
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,640
...have you heard from Linda?

638
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,040
You know, or you wouldn't ask.
Did you read her letter?

639
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,600
No. It wasn't addressed to me.

640
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,720
- Is that what's bothering you?
- It just seems strange.

641
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,160
She moves out of town and sends
Christmas cards to both of us.

642
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,440
So a letter addressed just to you
made me wonder.

643
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,040
Why is this bothering you now?
We're on top of the world.

644
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,760
OK. She is coming into town.

645
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
I mean, she's here, in fact.

646
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,760
- Have you seen her?
- No, I have not.

647
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,960
As a matter of fact, if you want to,
we'll have drinks with her today.

648
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,520
- Weren't you going to tell me?
- Honey, I just did.

649
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,360
- God, Dan. Sometimes, I swear...
- What's the matter with you?

650
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,760
How can you be jealous after so long?

651
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,520
Apparently I still have reason to be.

652
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,160
You were going to see her
and not tell me.

653
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,000
I was going to see her,
not sleep with her.

654
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,960
I'm not saying you planned to,
but by not inviting me,

655
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,120
you leave yourself the margin for error
where accidents can happen.

656
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,120
- You're still diddling around.
- I don't diddle.

657
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,720
I'm not going to bed with her.
We may share a salad, that's all.

658
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,240
- I want to get married.
- What?

659
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,680
You accuse me of cheating on you,
now you want to marry me.

660
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,480
- Don't you ever think about it?
- Yes. I just don't know what I think.

661
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,040
I feel I've really grown in the last
three years, and you've stood still.

662
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,880
No, that's not what's going on here.
You are so afraid of being hurt...

663
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,840
...you're making a demand
I can't meet, pushing me!

664
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,760
- Is that what you want?
- You just don't get it.

665
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,200
I know you're scared
of taking this step. I am, too.

666
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,440
But that's the great thing, you see?
We could be scared together.

667
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,200
Look, I just... I want to be sure of you.

668
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:57,440
And if that means I'm a little insecure
or neurotic, well so be it.

669
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,040
I just want to know that if I'm on air
with you five years from now,

670
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,240
it's because you love me,
not because I'm your business partner.

671
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,280
Well, I do.

672
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,320
I do. Come on.

673
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,360
Come on...

674
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,360
You don't want to get married.

675
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,360
No, Dan, you don't want to.
Let me hear you say it.

676
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,880
- Time, please.
- Hey, Mark.

677
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,360
Yeah.

678
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,600
Settle an argument.
Why do they call this the green room?

679
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,080
I don't know.

680
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,240
See you in there.

681
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,680
I'm sorry, but...

682
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,320
...I don't want to get married.

683
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,960
- Coming through. Watch it.
- Lorie. Fifteen seconds to air.

684
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,200
I said now.

685
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,120
<i>Places, everybody.</i>

686
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,040
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

687
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,200
Five, four, three, two...

688
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,880
<i>Perkell Heating and Cooling</i>
<i>brings you 'He Said, She Said'.</i>

689
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,920
<i>With your commentators</i>
<i>Lorraine Bryer and Dan Hanson.</i>

690
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,320
<i>The issue today: Proposition 41,</i>
<i>the highway merger.</i>

691
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,000
Good afternoon, Dan.

692
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,960
Proposition 41,
on the ballot in October,

693
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,680
provides for a new connecting spur
to merge Highways 710 and 88.

694
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,320
In my view,
this merger is long overdue.

695
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,560
It would improve access
and allow for maximum growth,

696
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,920
especially in the outlying areas.

697
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,400
I know what you'll say, Dan.

698
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,680
That Proposition 41 can wait,
that there's no need for it now.

699
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,480
But in two or three years,
it will be too late.

700
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,240
We must go forward...or we stop.

701
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,960
Now is the time.

702
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,200
And that's the way I see it.

703
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,960
Well, Lorie, there you go,
over-intellectualising again.

704
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,560
Common sense tells us
a merger simply is not needed.

705
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,040
These highways function well
independently, thank you.

706
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,320
A merger would only mean
more spending,

707
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,480
traffic and congestion
in an already crowded area.

708
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,120
And those outlying areas
have reached a plateau

709
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,840
where further growth
is just not expected.

710
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,480
There's nothing wrong
with the status quo, Lorie.

711
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,160
As my Uncle Olaf used to say,
"Why fix it, if it ain't broken?"

712
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,600
That's the way I see it... Ow!

713
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,920
Lorie.

714
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,480
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am. Of course.

715
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,040
- I'm fine.
- Sure?

716
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,400
Yeah. I'm fine, Mark.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.

717
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,040
My keys are inside. My purse.
My whole life is inside.

718
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,760
- OK, I'll...
- I'm not going back in.

719
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,920
- All right.
- Do you think I hurt him? Who cares?

720
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,520
I'm going to walk home.
I feel so good, that's what I'll do.

721
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,600
Lorie, I...

722
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,840
- Give me a ride home?
- Sure, you could use it.

723
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,840
- Where do these go?
- It all goes in the hall.

724
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,240
The lousy records,
the toys, the models.

725
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,920
- What about this?
- No. I want that.

726
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,680
You've known me a long time, Cindy.
I'm a rational person, aren't I?

727
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,320
- Yeah, somewhat.
- I mean, I'm not crazy.

728
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,600
But at some point you have to say:

729
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,480
"Yes, we go forward,"
or "No, we made a big mistake."

730
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,920
I feel great, I really do.

731
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,040
- Stop it.
- Come on.

732
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,840
I'm not going to let you do this
to yourself, or your VCR.

733
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,800
He's not worth it.
You didn't need him to start with.

734
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,080
You could have your own show.

735
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,880
That's just it. I never wanted
a TV show. I don't even watch TV.

736
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,360
The New York Times loved my work.

737
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm gonna call them back,
I'll find the number.

738
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,360
To think I let him detour me
from my original purpose.

739
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,000
It's three years gone,
but I'm still reasonably young, right?

740
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,080
Has it really been three years?

741
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,800
All the time I wasted
overlooking all those rotten things.

742
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You remember, Cindy.
It was obvious right from the start.

743
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:10,160
We've decided, in a very
Solomon-like manner, to try you both.

744
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,280
You've both been following
this public sculpture thing?

745
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,640
- Oh, yeah.
- You don't have to imitate Monroe.

746
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,480
Use your own style,
your own opinions.

747
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,920
1,500 words on my desk
by five o'clock.

748
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,000
And may the best man win.
Or the best woman.

749
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,800
Listen...

750
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,680
After tomorrow, one of us will probably
never speak to the other again. So...

751
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,680
...how about dinner?

752
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,560
Shocking as this may sound,
I'd like to, unfortunately I have a date.

753
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,920
Well, it's not actually a date,
it's more like an obligation. Sorry.

754
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,600
Thank you.

755
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,280
- Guess what.
- What?

756
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,920
- Guess.
- What?

757
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,760
They're printing
the <i>New Republic</i> piece.

758
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,640
That's great, the one about
the Sandinistas? Terrific.

759
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,040
- I brought a copy for you to see.
- Oh, I'd love to. Great!

760
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,880
- No, I...
- What? The lead's no good?

761
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,720
- It takes too long to start?
- We're doing it again.

762
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,000
We are relating to each other
as writers and political colleagues.

763
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,080
We are not relating to each other
as a woman and a man.

764
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,280
Adam...

765
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,600
Look...

766
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,680
What I wanted to say...

767
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,720
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

768
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,040
It's not sexual or exciting
between us any more.

769
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:03,320
I think that it was, once,
but it's just not there any more.

770
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,040
- This is hard to say...
- It's hard to listen to.

771
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,120
I know...and I'm sorry.

772
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,280
Look, I'm not a complete moron.
I sort of saw this coming.

773
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,400
- But I don't think it's all my fault.
- I'm not saying it is.

774
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,400
Well...

775
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,640
Maybe two cerebral people
just shouldn't be together.

776
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,120
I gotta go.

777
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,320
- No, don't go.
- I prefer it, if you don't mind.

778
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,840
See you.

779
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,200
Wow, that was a fast date!

780
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,800
- Looks like we can't avoid each other.
- Maybe it's fate.

781
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,680
- The signora is ordering dinner?
- Caesar salad's great here.

782
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,160
- No, I'm...
- Come on.

783
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,360
All right, I'll have a Caesar salad.
And a gin and tonic.

784
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,440
- I'll have the same again.
- Fine. Enjoy your meal.

785
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,400
We had a fight.

786
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,880
Well, actually we didn't.

787
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,960
We didn't have a fight...
We broke up.

788
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,000
I don't know
why I'm telling you this.

789
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
I'm really sorry.

790
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,200
- Who broke it off?
- I did.

791
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,880
Sometimes that's
the more painful position.

792
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,960
It's always easier to love
than be loved.

793
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,760
Hurting someone
feels worse than being hurt.

794
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,880
God knows, I'm always terrified
to give bad news to a woman.

795
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,840
Maybe that's weak, I don't know.

796
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,800
Yeah.

797
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,080
So, how do you know so much?

798
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,880
Believe me, I've been there.

799
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,840
- Dan!
- Susan, hi.

800
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,320
Excuse me.

801
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,040
You look fantastic.
That dress is...

802
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,680
That's your colour, that is you.

803
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,480
Thanks. And thank you
for the flowers. So beautiful!

804
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,360
Oh, you got them, good.

805
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,320
- Let's get together next week.
- Sounds good.

806
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,000
- Be sure to wear that dress.
- I will.

807
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Oh, shit, my tit popped out,
I hate it when that happens, don't you?

808
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,320
- Bye.
- See you later.

809
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,760
Classy, with a capital K.

810
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,120
And you. Look at you, Mr Smooth.

811
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,960
I can't believe I was letting myself
get sucked into this rap of yours.

812
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,160
"It's better to love than to be loved."

813
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,120
This... You were coming on to me.

814
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,600
- This was a pass.
- You call that a pass?

815
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,440
Men are all alike.
You don't take us seriously.

816
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,040
No, wait. I was just thinking.

817
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,800
Was that a pass?

818
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,320
Oh, my God, you're right.

819
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,640
That was a pass. I'm sorry.

820
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,880
But what was I supposed to do?
There you were...

821
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,040
...vulnerable, attractive...

822
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,480
Oh, darn it.

823
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,480
Darn it, there I go again, you see?

824
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,920
I'm out of control,
I can't stop myself.

825
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,920
Anyway...I'm through
with all of you for a while.

826
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,840
Other things are more important
to me right now.

827
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,280
- Like what?
- The chance to say something.

828
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,520
To reach people.
What every journalist wants. To work...

829
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,160
...at the New York Times.

830
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,640
For now, I'll settle for this column.

831
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,360
My column!
I'm gonna make up a plate for you.

832
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,200
- No, don't.
- It's like eating with a shark.

833
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,680
- OK? A little pasta.
- Sauce.

834
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,240
- Salad.
- Tomato.

835
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,440
OK? Have fun.

836
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,840
To my column.

837
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,000
The paper doesn't come out
for a few more hours.

838
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,920
Hello.

839
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,280
Oh, hi, Cindy.

840
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,320
Yes, I know, isn't it great?
Oh, thank you.

841
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:53,640
Don't you think it's kind of a minor
victory, though, having his printed, too?

842
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,880
You're right, reactionary writing like his
will only make me look better.

843
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,800
No, I just got in.

844
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,240
Why, did you try calling earlier?

845
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,120
Adam... Oh.

846
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,560
God... No, that was hours ago.

847
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,240
Well, I was...

848
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,640
Actually, I was having dinner
with Mr Reactionary himself.

849
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:29,720
Well, yeah. He did crush
my contact lens, but it was OK.

850
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,520
Yeah. Well, no. Actually, I...

851
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,000
I had a good time.

852
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:45,000
No. This is a one-shot deal.
I won't let him spin his web around me.

853
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,280
Hi, Lorie, I haven't seen you here
in ages. Want to dance?

854
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,000
Good, but could you
tone it down just a little?

855
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,760
OK, next slow song,
the guy over there... Don't look.

856
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,680
- What was your name?
- Steve.

857
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,160
Steve. OK, thanks.
Here's the five bucks.

858
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,400
- No need to pay me.
- Keep it anyway.

859
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,760
Could you just button up your shirt?
Thank you.

860
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,520
Hi.

861
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,880
- Great music.
- Oh, it's fantastic.

862
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,560
What are you looking at?

863
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,000
I know that guy.
He is such a drag.

864
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,880
He's always chasing me. If he asks
me to dance, will you dance with me?

865
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,120
- I... Look, you know...
- Lorie.

866
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,640
It's me, Steve.

867
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:00,680
I haven't seen you in a long,
long time. You look great.

868
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,120
- Hi, I'm Dan.
- Wait. Would you like to dance?

869
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,640
I miss the way we move together.

870
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,600
Sorry, but I have this dance.

871
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,280
- Thanks, you saved me.
- No sweat.

872
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,920
Well...

873
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,760
- Well...
- Listen, I had fun.

874
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,200
Goodnight.

875
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,000
What's wrong?

876
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:12,440
I don't want to have to play games
and flirt and all that shit any more.

877
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,120
What I'm trying to say is...
you're a good guy.

878
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,440
Your politics are screwed up,
you're not a great writer,

879
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:26,000
but you're not a psycho
and you're cute, in a way.

880
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,680
Don't you ever get lonely?

881
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,240
I know you have a lot of women,
but don't you just get...

882
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,800
...lonely anyway?

883
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,640
And scared?

884
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:50,960
Like your whole life is going by,
and your days and your nights.

885
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,680
Nobody's around to see it,
except you.

886
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,640
I would just... I would just like
to be with you, tonight.

887
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,720
You're shaking.

888
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,920
Don't say you haven't done this before.

889
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,640
Not with you.

890
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Will you, Olga, have this man, Olaf,
to be your husband?

891
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,800
To live with him in marriage,
according to the word of God?

892
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,640
Yes, I do.

893
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,800
I now pronounce them
husband and wife.

894
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,280
You owe me a drink.

895
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,200
What God has put together
let no one put asunder.

896
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,880
I'm so pleased you're here today.

897
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,760
There's a Swedish saying...
how does it go?

898
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,200
Which translates loosely to:

899
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,200
"Happiness is easy,
if you just take off your overcoat."

900
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,560
Well, today, I took off my overcoat.

901
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,880
But enough speeches.
Let's do the chicken dance.

902
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,560
- May I have this dance?
- I'd love to.

903
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,920
Oh, this is hunky-dory.

904
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,400
- Want to dance?
- No.

905
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,840
- Come on.
- I mean, there's just... No, because...

906
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,400
What's so funny?

907
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,720
- Hey...
- What?

908
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,280
I love you.

909
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,920
I'm not telling you this so that I'll get
the exact same response from you.

910
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,560
I'm just telling you
because these are my feelings.

911
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,880
If you can't express your feelings,
what's the point of having them?

912
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,120
And I feel really good
about telling you this.

913
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,080
You really don't have to say
anything in response.

914
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,200
Really, you don't have to.

915
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,040
Here you go, sweetie.

916
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,200
Thank you.

917
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,320
He probably doesn't even remember.

918
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,760
He always forgets the details.

919
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,400
All he remembers is the end result.

920
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,080
I remember every moment
we spent together.

921
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,240
All the little things.

922
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,560
Like when I fixed his carburettor.
He was so impressed.

923
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,600
Or when he broke the window.
You had to call the repairman.

924
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,640
The window, what window?
Oh, yes, I remember.

925
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,800
I'm sure he doesn't.

926
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,600
Well, enough of this.

927
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,560
From now on, no more looking back.

928
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,040
Do you think that guy at
the New York Times remembers me?

929
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,080
Next week, I could have a new job.

930
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,640
I think his number is still
in my Rolodex, back at the...

931
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,640
...studio.

932
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,200
Along with my car, my whole life.

933
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:42,360
- What shall I do with these?
- In the box with the files.

934
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,720
Thank you, Mark.
You're saving my life.

935
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,720
<i>You never know what's going to be</i>
<i>tossed around on He Said, She Said.</i>

936
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,640
<i>See Hanson and Bryer, round two,</i>
<i>tomorrow at noon on Channel 11.</i>

937
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:02,480
Wally, what the hell is going on
with these commercials?

938
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,800
I can't talk right now.
He'll tell you all about it.

939
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,960
Yeah. Do what you can.
Gotta go. Bye.

940
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,480
- Lorie, Lorie...
- Wally, Wally.

941
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,800
You are advertising a show
that is not going to be on.

942
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,120
Take it easy. Look at these messages:
"Good for Lorie." "It's about time!"

943
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:24,520
You're a hero. Most women would
love to do that to their husbands.

944
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,480
I don't want to be a hero.
And he is not my husband.

945
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:33,600
The last thing he will ever be
is my husband. Understand that?

946
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,920
Totally. But they all want to see
what you'll do tomorrow.

947
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,640
Weller wants to see.
That's why he's coming.

948
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:45,360
Then he's going to see a lot of nothing,
OK? Because, it's... Well...

949
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:52,440
It's over, all right? Dan and l, we...
We broke up.

950
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,200
My God.

951
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,120
I'm sorry.

952
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,520
I'm really sorry.

953
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,320
But you can still do the show.
It might be more interesting.

954
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,760
I can't believe you, Wally,
you're such a man.

955
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,240
Thanks.

956
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,720
How can you separate
love and work like that?

957
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:26,160
Well...love is love...work is work.

958
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,920
Love...work.

959
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,600
Work isn't love.
Love shouldn't be...

960
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,880
- All right.
- Look, I'll make it easy for you.

961
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,760
We'll tape his half before you arrive.
You needn't even see him.

962
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,360
I'm through, Wally.

963
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,480
All right, look...

964
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:49,440
I didn't want to say this,
but you've still got a contract.

965
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:54,360
I'm no good at being tough,
but the lawyers will eat you alive.

966
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,400
- Thanks, Wally, you're some friend.
- Please.

967
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,400
- Linda Metzger is on line 1.
- Not now. I'll call her back.

968
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,000
Linda Metzger?

969
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:10,000
- Is she calling here for Dan now?
- No, for me. We go way back.

970
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,560
She's nothing, she's always
chasing me. A fatal attraction.

971
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,240
She may be nothing to you,
but just her name makes me want to...

972
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,600
Oh, Linda.

973
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,360
- What?
- What?

974
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,280
- What did you just say?
- I said...

975
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,200
I said, "Oh, Linda."
I'm very sorry.

976
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,080
That's all right.

977
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,520
- I'm sorry.
- No, I see how it could happen.

978
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,560
We're both women,
our names begin with 'L'.

979
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,280
- You're sleeping with both of us.
- Not any more.

980
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,880
- When did you stop?
- When I started going out with you.

981
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,560
Started? Well, what does that mean?
Did you...?

982
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,760
- Did you do it after you slept with me?
- I... I can't remember.

983
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,720
You can't remember?

984
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,360
Think, think, Dan.

985
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,720
Was there somebody else
in your bed with you, who wasn't me?

986
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,520
I don't know,
I'm sure we probably did once.

987
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,920
All right, twice.

988
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,960
What am I supposed
to feel bad about?

989
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,800
That the minute you and I touched,
my other involvements didn't melt away?

990
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,800
Not all your involvements.

991
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,960
Just all your sexual involvements.

992
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,360
What is the big deal?

993
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,440
From the moment
I went to bed with you,

994
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,760
sleeping with another man
became unthinkable to me.

995
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,200
But for you, sleeping with another
woman remained...thinkable.

996
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,640
That was in the beginning.

997
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,480
Let's talk about now.
You're the one who...

998
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,840
- The one who what?
- The one who I'm with now.

999
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,480
Isn't that what counts?

1000
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:12,320
- I want to meet her.
- You really think that's a good idea?

1001
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
I want to meet her.

1002
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,680
I've been working on our new Fall Line.
I brought the catalogue.

1003
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,120
You should take a look.
I'm sure we could find you...

1004
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,200
...something that would be flattering.

1005
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,240
- Honey?
- What?

1006
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,680
- We have this little thing with our food.
- Dan.

1007
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,520
Don't be embarrassed.
Dan tells me everything.

1008
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,600
I'm sure you know
most of his secrets by now, too.

1009
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,120
- Well.
- Well, maybe not all of them.

1010
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,720
We lost our virginity together.

1011
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,120
We were fourteen, just kids.

1012
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,320
- But even then he was incredible.
- Well.

1013
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,240
Don't you think so?

1014
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,400
Over the years, I've kept a diary
of our favourite sexual positions.

1015
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,080
- Oh, neat.
- Just a few notes and some drawings.

1016
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,760
- Would you like to see them?
- Honey?

1017
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,920
What do you say?

1018
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,760
- Here's one. March 17th, 1980.
- Whoops!

1019
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,120
- You remember?
- Yes, the kitchen.

1020
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,600
Right.

1021
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,720
You can see from the drawing
just where to put the blender.

1022
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,440
Oh, Linda.

1023
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:41,280
I think this one
would be just cute on you.

1024
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,240
Honey, you OK?

1025
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,160
Why don't you just have sex
and get it over with?

1026
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,880
I think I'm just going to get out of here.

1027
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,360
What kind of stunt is this?

1028
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,560
Seeing you together,
there seemed to be no room for me.

1029
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:08,840
- That's unfair. You wanted to meet her.
- Yes, I realise that, but...

1030
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,280
If you can be that way with someone
else, I can't be with you right now.

1031
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,600
<i>Stand by, please.</i>

1032
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,360
Don't be nervous,
it's just an audition tape.

1033
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:28,320
If it's bad, we throw it out.
But I know you guys will be great.

1034
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,560
Wait a minute, Wally.
This isn't the copy I wrote.

1035
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,800
We had to trim it. We don't have
much time to make our point.

1036
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,480
Boom-boom, and next commercial!

1037
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:44,000
I thought that we would be writing.
It's an opinion show, after all.

1038
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:49,080
- You will, once you get the knack.
- It's just an audition, to see how we look.

1039
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,880
- Right.
- What difference does it make?

1040
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,800
- Don't blow this for us.
- I'm not, it's just...

1041
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,400
- You wanna know the secret?
- What?

1042
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,560
- Just smile big and pretty.
- You're gonna be great.

1043
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,120
- Here we go.
- I gotta go.

1044
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,440
Wow, it's true, the camera
really does add weight.

1045
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,560
Eight, seven, six...

1046
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,720
I think there's a spot on your dress.

1047
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,480
- Hi, I'm Dan Hanson.
- And I'm Lorie Bryer.

1048
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,560
- And this is <i>He Said...</i>
<i>- ...She Said.</i>

1049
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,800
<i>Stop tape, please.</i>

1050
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,240
Lorie...

1051
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:34,240
Lorie, it's going great.
But this isn't a game show.

1052
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,400
- Try smiling a little less.
- But she said...

1053
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,960
The make-up lady has
guided many great careers.

1054
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,960
The enthusiasm is wonderful,
just not quite so many teeth.

1055
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,200
Otherwise I'm thrilled.
Let's go again...

1056
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,120
- You're doing it on purpose.
- I'm just nervous.

1057
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,560
- Where's this spot?
- It's on your left boob.

1058
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,280
- Hi, I'm Dan Hanson.
- And I'm Lorie Bryer.

1059
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,160
- And this is <i>He Said...</i>
<i>- ...She Said.</i>

1060
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,440
Our issue of the day is garbage.

1061
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,960
Our dumps will be full in ten years,
and what then?

1062
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,360
A lot of people feel
it's the government's responsibility.

1063
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,080
Maybe they're right.
But as my Uncle Olaf used to say,

1064
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,280
"You make the trash, you take it out."

1065
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,280
<i>What's she doing?</i>
<i>Stop tape, please.</i>

1066
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,200
- Honey, we're both on camera.
- I'm sorry.

1067
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,280
- If you don't want this, just say!
- I did, if you recall.

1068
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,760
I'm doing the best I can.

1069
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,960
- Can we try again?
- Why do we always do what you want?

1070
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:34,760
What? I took vacation to visit your
parents, I'm always at your place.

1071
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,440
- Don't you want to be?
- Yes, I just feel like a stranger.

1072
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,280
- That's just your attitude.
- There's nowhere for my stuff.

1073
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,040
- Move your exercycle.
- Unbelievable.

1074
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,960
What about your man things
all over the place?

1075
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,800
- Man things?
- Your big shoes and 3-D map.

1076
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,280
And you're the only man in North
America who still wears pyjamas.

1077
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,760
Hold it.

1078
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:03,800
Why don't we take a short break
and then try it again?

1079
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,960
Good.

1080
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,400
I didn't mean to look like a retard.

1081
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,480
Hey, it's no big deal.

1082
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,160
We've got the best jobs in Baltimore.

1083
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,560
So television doesn't want us.
It's television's loss.

1084
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,440
You know you drag me out here,
you scare me to death.

1085
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,800
And just when I think I have
every reason to be mad at you...

1086
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,240
...that's when you're the nicest.

1087
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,200
You know all my tricks.

1088
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,880
Come on.

1089
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,600
- I was so awful...
- No, you weren't.

1090
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,320
I was terrible. I could've died.

1091
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,680
- Lorie?
- What?

1092
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:58,880
Honey, let's do it. Let's move in
together. What do you say?

1093
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:07,000
Well, guys, we went over the tape,
and, believe it or not, it looked great.

1094
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,080
What do you say?

1095
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,440
I say yes.

1096
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,160
- You were crazy to say we were good.
- What did you want, the truth?

1097
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,960
It's a beautiful story.
You should be grateful, I helped you.

1098
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:25,480
Well, now there are other people
you can help, Wally.

1099
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,720
This can't be happening.
Work with me, God.

1100
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,000
Lorie, I'm begging you.

1101
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,440
- Bye, boss. See you tomorrow.
- And you, Judas.

1102
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,360
You may not have a job tomorrow.

1103
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,440
I may not have a job tomorrow.

1104
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,200
Please!

1105
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,400
Wait, wait. Come back.

1106
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,720
Forget about Wally.

1107
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,840
You look a little ragged.
I don't mind helping you.

1108
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,840
Oh, God.

1109
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,840
Oh, my God.

1110
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,360
Oh, my God.
Stop the car. Back up.

1111
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,080
- What's the matter?
- Just...

1112
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,760
- God.
- What?

1113
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,560
Shit, of all the restaurants.
Look at that jerk!

1114
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,200
And at our table, too.

1115
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,680
God.

1116
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,720
Lorie, stop torturing yourself.
Come on, let me take you home.

1117
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,080
No.

1118
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:32,000
Mark, could you be a pal
and do me a really big favour?

1119
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,480
What?

1120
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,760
Well?

1121
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,200
He's going to go to her hotel.

1122
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,800
He's... He's gonna spend
the night with her.

1123
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,240
To hell with him!
To hell with her!

1124
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,760
- No, wait.
- What?

1125
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,080
- We're going over there.
- Lorie!

1126
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,160
The next thing I know, whack!
I actually saw stars.

1127
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:36,120
- We've a right to eat in a public place.
- ...seriously injured, I could sue!

1128
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,160
- We'll have lunch.
- The Caesar's great.

1129
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,160
- Maybe he'll choke.
- There's blood pouring from my head.

1130
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,840
- She storms out, all hell breaks loose...
- Dan...

1131
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,920
- What?
- She's right over there. By the door.

1132
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:54,240
- Hi, I didn't know you were here!
- She's got some nerve.

1133
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,560
Jerk! The corpse of our relationship
not even cold.

1134
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,120
OK, I can do this, too.

1135
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,120
- May we join you?
- Come on over.

1136
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,720
- OK.
- Sure.

1137
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,720
Linda, how nice to see you... Sit.

1138
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,960
Linda, you remember Mark.

1139
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:20,280
- So, here we are.
- Yes, aren't we, though.

1140
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:27,480
Isn't it great that we can all get
together, so soon after our break-up?

1141
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,160
Did Dan tell you, Linda?
We broke up.

1142
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,120
Of course, he tells you everything.

1143
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:38,080
- I think it's great you can be so adult.
- Thank you.

1144
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,280
You've bounced back, too. Four hours
and here we are, right on schedule.

1145
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:49,160
I had a choice: sit in my office and
wallow, or keep my date with Linda.

1146
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,800
- Why don't we go someplace else?
- No, I love this place.

1147
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,640
Dan and I had our first date here.
At this very table, in fact.

1148
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,520
- Do you remember, Dan?
- Yes, but I wouldn't call it a date.

1149
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,160
She ate my dinner and insulted me.

1150
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:08,840
- I should've known.
- It's for the best, now we're free.

1151
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,120
Free to pursue our careers,
other people,

1152
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:16,000
though I didn't think
you'd start so soon.

1153
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,720
There's nothing going on here.

1154
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:23,000
Of course not, Dan would never...
You flirtatious ass.

1155
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,480
You haven't changed
since I first saw you.

1156
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,000
- How could you even think...?
- You followed me here.

1157
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,600
I wasn't following you.
And who's at our table?

1158
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,760
- Whose fat butt is at our table?
- Dan...

1159
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,560
- It's not our table any more.
- Whose fault is that?

1160
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:43,680
- Let's go.
- No, stay.

1161
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,040
- You're both self-destructive.
- I agree.

1162
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,080
- Shut up.
- We should go.

1163
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,800
- Leave her out of this.
- I'd love to leave her out of it.

1164
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,640
Dan, are you all right?

1165
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,760
Come on. This way.

1166
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,040
<i>Some people say the news</i>
<i>is not entertainment.</i>

1167
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,600
<i>They might think again if they'd been</i>
<i>watching station WBAL in Baltimore.</i>

1168
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,160
<i>- On an opinion show...</i>
- Come here.

1169
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,600
<i>Commentator Lorraine Bryer</i>
<i>was more forceful than usual...</i>

1170
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,600
<i>...and threw a coffee cup</i>
<i>at Dan Hanson,</i>

1171
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,440
<i>who is reported in stable</i>
<i>but confused condition.</i>

1172
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:41,520
<i>The small station was flooded with</i>
<i>calls about what will happen tomorrow.</i>

1173
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:45,240
<i>- I'm glad you don't drink coffee.</i>
<i>- I drink hot tea.</i>

1174
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,400
My God, we made ET.
That is so great.

1175
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,280
Lorie is going to hate this.
I wonder if she saw it.

1176
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,320
- What does it matter?
- It may be for the best.

1177
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,440
I know. You're right.
I mean, I'm glad it's over.

1178
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:07,760
I don't need to be hit on the head.
Not three times, anyway.

1179
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,040
Wow, that perfume is...

1180
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,680
So...

1181
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,840
What do you think?

1182
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,520
Should we go to bed together?

1183
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,640
I... I can't sleep here,
I don't have my pyjamas.

1184
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,880
I don't think you're going to need them.

1185
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,080
Part of me wants to, but I can't.

1186
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,320
Dan, you've changed a lot.

1187
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,480
But I think I have, too.

1188
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:00,320
We've always had
a lot of laughs and good sex.

1189
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,840
Maybe we're ready
for something more.

1190
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,760
I think I am.

1191
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:16,760
Oh, Linda. I'm sorry.

1192
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:28,040
Dan, go home and get your pyjamas.

1193
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,160
Hi.

1194
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,160
Hi.

1195
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:20,160
I didn't have my pyjamas, or anywhere
to wear them since you kicked me out.

1196
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,920
- I thought you were staying with Linda.
- No.

1197
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,440
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to stay here.

1198
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,640
Where would you suggest I stay?

1199
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,320
- What about a hotel?
- It's late, I don't want to.

1200
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:44,360
All right, you can sleep on the couch.

1201
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,960
But just for tonight.

1202
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,600
- Don't think, because you're here...
- Believe me, I won't.

1203
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,400
Thanks.

1204
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:15,840
I have to write my copy.
Did the lawyer call you?

1205
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,320
Yeah.

1206
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,520
- One more show, huh?
- Yeah.

1207
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,640
Well...

1208
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,160
- I guess it's for the best.
- Definitely.

1209
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,280
Well...

1210
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,640
- Night.
- Goodnight.

1211
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:26,000
- Dan.
- It's OK, honey, I'm all right.

1212
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,480
Dan.

1213
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:35,440
- I think I'd like some cheesecake.
- What?

1214
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:40,440
I think you could use some, too.

1215
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,280
You're right, I could definitely
use some cheesecake.

1216
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,840
OK.

1217
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:04,080
You're not going to remember
any of this, are you?

1218
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:07,240
Lorie, I love you.

1219
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,080
I'm crazy about you.

1220
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,840
Don't ever leave me, please.

1221
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:17,840
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1222
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,480
I'll go get us some cheesecake.

1223
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,800
<i>- And that's the way I see it.</i>
<i>- OK. Stop tape, that's it.</i>

1224
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,160
Mr Weller.

1225
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,320
Well, Miss Bryer.

1226
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,800
I understand it's not
going to work out for us.

1227
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,960
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1228
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,480
I watched the taping just now.

1229
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:45,280
It's not the same
without both of you there.

1230
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:56,000
You know...I realised,
standing out there watching,

1231
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,600
exactly why I love
your show so much.

1232
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,440
It's not the issues,
not the social significance,

1233
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:07,960
but it's because there's
always this possibility...

1234
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:13,520
...that your wife, your husband,
your girlfriend, whatever...

1235
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,720
...will do exactly
what you did yesterday.

1236
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,280
It's what makes life interesting.

1237
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,480
<i>Stand by, please.</i>

1238
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:54,640
<i>Seven, six, five, four,</i>

1239
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,920
<i>three, two, one.</i>

1240
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,320
<i>And now, Perkell Heating</i>
<i>and Cooling...</i>

1241
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:05,560
- I'm sorry, sir. Very sorry.
- Me, too. They were a nice couple.

1242
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,360
<i>Today's topic: the Mayor's Council</i>
<i>on Mental Wellbeing.</i>

1243
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,200
Good afternoon.

1244
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:16,000
Before I begin today, I would like
to apologise to the viewing public

1245
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:21,880
for my irrational and inappropriate
behaviour on yesterday's show.

1246
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,880
I would also like
to clear something up

1247
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,600
concerning the proposed
highway merger.

1248
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,160
I would just like to say that...

1249
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,280
<i>...my opponent is right.</i>

1250
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,520
<i>The merger is not needed.</i>

1251
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:43,440
<i>Some things</i>
<i>are just not meant to be.</i>

1252
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,840
<i>You think you can make them</i>
<i>go in the same direction...</i>

1253
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,440
<i>...but all you get is...</i>

1254
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:58,760
...congestion and
increased traffic and...hurt.

1255
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:04,080
<i>The highways should be allowed</i>
<i>to run their course.</i>

1256
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:07,000
<i>I would also like to say:</i>

1257
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,560
<i>Dan, wherever you are...</i>

1258
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,600
Look, I cleaned my cup.

1259
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,960
Cut to the logo, start Dan's tape.
Oh, man...

1260
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,920
Poor Lorie.

1261
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:25,440
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>Before I begin my rebuttal, Lorie,</i>

1262
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:29,600
<i>I'd like to make a statement about the</i>
<i>highway merger discussed yesterday.</i>

1263
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,600
<i>I would like to go on record</i>
<i>as reversing my original opinion.</i>

1264
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,720
<i>The highways are ripe for a merger.</i>

1265
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:41,400
<i>This proposal will ensure the future</i>
<i>growth that is sorely needed.</i>

1266
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,960
<i>As my Uncle Olaf used to...</i>

1267
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,480
<i>No.</i>

1268
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:52,360
<i>I'm not going to say that any more.</i>
<i>It's not my Uncle Olaf talking, Lorie...</i>

1269
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,960
<i>It's me.</i>

1270
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,920
<i>And what I'm saying is that...</i>

1271
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,280
<i>...I would like another chance.</i>

1272
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:04,440
<i>I just don't want to be apart from you.</i>

1273
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,920
<i>And that's the way I see it.</i>

1274
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,000
Does this mean...?

1275
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,840
Pretty scary, huh?

1276
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,440
Yeah.

1277
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,440
God, my contact came out again.

1278
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,080
- Hold on, I'll find it.
- No, you'll crush it again.

1279
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:47,520
- I never crushed it.
- Yes, you did.

1280
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:50,160
See, magic.

1281
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,520
So what do you think
about the Mayor's Council?

1282
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:00,480
- What do you think I think?
- I knew it.

1283
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:03,880
You want this on the air?

1284
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,560
No, Ray. Some things
are more important than a TV show.

1285
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,240
Even I understand that.
These kids deserve their privacy.

1286
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:14,760
They don't need their relationship
exploited so that we can...

1287
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,920
Camera 1, get on Dan.
Camera 2, zoom in on Lorie.

Subtitled by IRC_LoaD

1289
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,200
- I guess she won that one.
- What do you mean? He won.

1290
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,480
What's the use of even talking to you.
You're an old fool.

1291
