1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,920
DYLAN: My dad is a writer
who specialized in adventure.

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
This is Benjamin Mee.

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,120
I am surrounded by hundreds,
probably thousands of killer bees.

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,880
If I wasn't wearing this suit,
I would be dead in an instant!

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,200
ANNOUNCER: May I have
your attention, please?

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,040
DYLAN: He interviewed
dangerous dictators.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,520
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,440
What's your favorite movie?

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,520
Segunda.

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,480
DYLAN: He even flew into
the center of Hurricane Charley.

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,320
It was a Category 4 storm.

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,120
How far are we from the eye?

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,600
PILOT: About two minutes!

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,320
This hurricane, sir,

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
Charley, is really kneading us well, sir.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,240
Tell me when it gets severe!

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,840
(LAUGHS)

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,000
DYLAN: He knew the ins and outs
of strange and exotic adventure,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
backwards and forwards.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,480
But nothing prepared him for this one.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,040
Come on, come on. We're late, guys.
Let's go. Come on.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,760
- Come on, come on. We're really late.
- (PHONE RINGING)

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,160
- ROSIE: Dad, can you get my hair?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,800
Dad, I'll just get waffles.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,440
No, no, no, I want you to have eggs, man.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,520
- We have time. You need the protein.
- We don't have time.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,720
- Mama always gave me almond milk.
- Dad, you didn't read the label.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,080
You didn't read the label.

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
- These aren't gluten free.
- Will you do that?

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
- I can't eat these!
- Did anybody even say good morning?

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
- Hello, Benjamin Mee.
- Take your thing.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,800
- Look, Dad, the dog!
- Don't step on the...

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, Sharon.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
No, I can't... I can't go hiking.

35
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,960
It's just not a great time for me.

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,680
Okay. Okay.
Listen, I'm gonna call again tomorrow.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
- Okay, thank you.
- Great!

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Where's our lunches?

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,200
What is on your feet?

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
Reindeer slippers.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
BENJAMIN: Look, I am the one
who gets the emails

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,320
about your lack of effort, man. Okay?

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,720
You either know where the book is
or you don't.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,200
Dad, it's whatever.
Look, I'll know it when I get to school.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,840
You know what?
"Whatever" is the laziest word

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,360
of the 20th century, all right?

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm... I've had it with "whatever."

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't want to hear it again
in this century ever again.

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,160
"Whatever" is over.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,520
He says it all the time. He won't have
anything left to say in this century.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm not lettin' you out of the car
till I get a new word.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,760
You know, you gotta focus, man.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
If you focused as much on your homework

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
as you do on your artwork, you'd have it all.

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,320
- But as it is...
- Dad, I finished The Seventh Tower.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,680
...you're gonna get an F.

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,600
Pernicious.

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,920
Thank you.

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,360
(MOUTHING)

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
BENJAMIN: Good word.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Dad. Nobody's gonna give an F
to a kid whose mom died six months ago.

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,520
What does perni... pern...

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,200
pernicious mean?

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,120
It's causing insidious harm or ruin.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
Causing damage.

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
DYLAN: Get out, get out, get out.

67
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,120
Keep goin', guys, come on.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
Dad!

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Man, all right.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,560
I'll get you a new... I'll get you a new bag.

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
Come on, sweetie. Come on.
Okay, where did Mom get the backpacks?

72
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
- WOMAN: Mr. Mee?
- Just don't worry about it.

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,880
- Hi. Oh, okay.
- Benjamin, I thought maybe...

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
Here you go, guys.
Here's your bag, sweetheart. Here.

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,440
There's one, there's two, all right.
Goodbye.

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,480
- Bye, honey.
- ROSIE: Bye, Dad!

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Bye, hon!

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
I thought, maybe...

79
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,480
It's lasagna. Dinner for three.

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,160
Great, thank you.

81
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Or four.

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,520
You know, my brother is actually
coming for dinner tonight.

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
So that's perfect.

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,480
And I'll get the dish back to you
within the week.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
In time. In time.

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,320
In time, then.

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,240
Thank you.

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,640
- ROSIE: Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetheart.

89
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Benjamin, I've arrived at a thought.

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Tell me, Dunc.

91
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,320
I believe you should court the girl
we met at Jamba Juice.

92
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,680
She's a stunner.

93
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,520
She keeps callin' me to go hiking.

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,680
- Benjamin, hike her.
- (CHUCKLES)

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
All right. Let's see.

96
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
BENJAMIN: Cerrado.

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
DUNCAN: Yeah, looks like
Bernie's closed for renovations.

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
Which means Bernie's hung over.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Is she a stunner? I mean,
is that what they call a stunner now?

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,160
I mean, what do I know?
I was spoiled. I had the real thing.

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, what else do we have around here?

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
Got Little Dom's.

103
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
No.

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,680
- Hey.
- Nope. No.

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Look. The world is gonna get very small

106
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,880
if you don't go to any of the places
where you and Katherine used to go.

107
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
I met her there.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
- Man, I'm sorry. That's right.
- It's all right, man.

109
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,040
You know, I gotta get back anyway.
Want to just do it next week?

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
Look.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
You gotta let a little sunlight in. Okay?

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Human interaction is a good thing.

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,160
Take it from a guy who spent six months
on a commercial fishing boat in Bali

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,680
trying to find himself.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
- (CHUCKLES)
- Remember that?

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,160
Yeah. And you know what I found?

117
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
I missed people.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
So just do me a favor.

119
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,360
Attempt to start over.

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,040
I shall try to start over.

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
(LAUGHS)

122
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
- You're handsome!
- Hey-a, so are you!

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,880
All right.

124
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
- I love you, my brother.
- I love you, too, man.

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,600
You're a good guy.

126
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
Sunlight.

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,120
- Human interaction.
- Got it!

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
Joy.

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,800
BENJAMIN: All right, McGinty, so get this.

130
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,720
I go to the volcano eruption site.
And I take the kids.

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,040
And I write about the end of the world
from the point of view

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,760
of the generation that's gonna save it.

133
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,200
And we do a whole thing
about how life is elemental,

134
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,280
and all the software, and laptops,

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
and apps in the world
aren't gonna change that.

136
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
And we call it... You ready?

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,880
iPocalypse.

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
Wow. Just wow.

139
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,040
It's good, right?
I mean, I think it could be a series,

140
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
like the killer bees.

141
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
That is bold stuff.

142
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,880
You're not gonna say yes, are you?

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,560
No. Listen.

144
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
I think we should give you
an online column.

145
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,560
That way, you'll be protected.
This is the way we live now.

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
If the paper goes down or gets sold,
you'll still be safe.

147
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,320
You'll be viral.

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,560
Don't keep me around out of...

149
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
I am not!

150
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,920
Out of sympathy. I mean, I hate sympathy.

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm sick of sympathy.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
I know.

153
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,160
- You know what?
- Bad things happen. You just keep going.

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
I quit.

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,960
Benjamin. You lost your wife, man.

156
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,600
In some quarters, sympathy would be
considered the appropriate response.

157
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,440
No, I'm not gonna sit around here
and spin my wheels

158
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,320
and live in a state of sponsored pity.

159
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Please! Let me lay you off
so you can get the benefits!

160
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
That's more sympathy! No!

161
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,320
I quit.

162
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,680
And I love you. And those patched elbows.

163
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
- You're killin' me.
- I'll miss you.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Text me.

165
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

166
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
Benjamin Mee.

167
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,440
- (WINDOW SQUEAKING)
- Classy. Real classy.

168
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,280
They left the cashbox right on the counter.

169
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
It was kind of their fault
if you think about it.

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
That's three suspensions in one semester.

171
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,040
That's gotta be some kind of record.

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get a prize.

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,960
Could you possibly be
making a joke right now?

174
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
- (SQUEAKING CONTINUES)
- Jesus, that is annoying!

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,840
- Dad, stop.
- No, I can fix it.

176
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
Dad, here he come...

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
BENJAMIN: Frame's a little loose. I...

178
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,520
Just give me one second.

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm fine with my squeaky window, Mr. Mee.

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
In fact, I rather enjoy it.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,240
Besides today's theft,

182
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
there's a darkness here
that we need to deal with.

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,840
Mr. Devereaux, Dylan's art teacher,

184
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,120
wanted you to see his wall mural.

185
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
We encourage creativity at the school.

186
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,880
There's a nice treatment
of the word "love".

187
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,400
A whimsical portraiture of recycling.

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,720
A hard-hitting exposé about world peace.

189
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
Here is the great Bob Marley.

190
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,040
Though we don't endorse
all that he stood for.

191
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,920
Sunflowers.

192
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,360
And guess which one is your son's.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,760
We're a three-strike school, Mr. Mee,
and today was his fourth strike.

194
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm sorry. We have to expel Dylan.

195
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,760
But, as one parent to another, I...

196
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,040
I would examine his inner life.

197
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,160
Let's go.

198
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,680
It's like he was expelling me
for my artwork.

199
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,920
I can almost live with the artwork.

200
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean, if Charles Manson needed
a personal muralist, you'd be the guy.

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,440
But no, he didn't expel you
because of the artwork.

202
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,960
He expelled you because you stole.

203
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
You stole!

204
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,520
It breaks my heart.

205
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,520
Always lasagna.

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,560
Dad, someday you're gonna
have to eat some of that lasagna.

207
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,800
Honey...

208
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,120
Or throw it away.

209
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,520
(CHUCKLES)

210
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,840
Hey, why didn't you go to Sadie's
for the play date, sweetie?

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,160
No reason. Lots to do here.

212
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,880
Hey, Rosie?

213
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Am I doin' anything right?

214
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,520
You're handsomer than the other dads.

215
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,360
Lots of them don't have hair.
So that's good.

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,000
Awesome. I'm gonna take baldness
off my list of things to worry about.

217
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,200
(GIGGLES)

218
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,040
Good.

(EXHALES)

220
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,200
Daddy, I can't sleep. The neighbors again.

221
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,760
Come on.

222
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,640
(PARTYGOERS CHATTERING)

223
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
Their happy is too loud.

224
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,400
Hey!

225
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,440
STEVENS: It's a new day for you, Mr. B.

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
We have a full day
of house hunting planned

227
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,880
and I think you'll be very excited
at what's available.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,640
We just want new. We want new...
New everything.

229
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,160
New opportunities, new schools, just new.

230
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,960
In the current economic environment,

231
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,720
you're gonna find that now,
the buyer is now the king.

232
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,480
But what I'm hopin' for
is like a big backyard.

233
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,880
Substantial, you know, just rolling hills.

234
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,880
It's gonna be very hard
to find rolling hills in the city.

235
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,520
- It just... It's just not available!
- Right, well...

236
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,240
I mean, stationary hills. We...

237
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,880
The hills don't have to roll, right, honey?

238
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,200
- Yeah?
- Just new.

239
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,400
Know what? It's all about new.
People love new.

240
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,920
I love new. Hell, I'm new!
Excuse my language, but I'm new.

241
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,440
- All right.
- Hell, I'm new.

242
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,760
I'm glad you're excited about it.

243
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,120
- You know? I'm excited about new stuff.
- Good.

244
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,720
- New is the new old.
- BENJAMIN: New.

245
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,200
- New, new, new.
- BOTH: New.

246
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,720
- I like you.
- I like you, too, Rosie.

247
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,840
I wish Dylan had come with us. This is fun.

248
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,200
I wish Dylan were here, too. (LAUGHS)

249
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,400
The more, the merrier.
That's what I always say, right?

250
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,800
Our mommy died.

251
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Oh, wow.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,400
My condolences go out
to you and your family, Mr. Mee.

253
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,920
Uh... Wow.

254
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,120
Sweetheart, Mr. Stevens
is a stranger, honey.

255
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,040
- He didn't know Mommy.
- I know, but he should have.

256
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

257
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Just knowing you, Rosie, right now,

258
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,320
I love your mom.

259
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,120
I love her. You know how I picture her?

260
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,560
I picture your face on a grown lady.

261
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,440
BENJAMIN: How long you been
doin' this job?

262
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,960
First day. It's my first day.

263
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,440
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. First day.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,280
And so, our adventure begins.

ROSIE: Hmm. No.

266
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Never.

267
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,120
Almost.

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
Not quite.

269
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,320
We are now running out of options.

270
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,680
Dad.

271
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,200
BENJAMIN: (CHUCKLING) Listen, what...
I mean, what would we do with 18 acres?

272
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,160
STEVENS: I'm gonna be honest with you.

273
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,720
The Rosemoor property
has some challenges.

274
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,240
Well, what doesn't?

275
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,680
STEVENS: True, but this situation...
I want to offer the word "unique".

276
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,320
Wait a second. Is that it?

277
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,320
- Yes.
- Rosie.

278
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
- And...
- BENJAMIN: Look.

279
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,160
BENJAMIN: You don't have
to take a picture, Rosie.

280
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,680
Why not?

281
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,440
'Cause we're gonna live here.

282
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,760
Mr. Mee, we have to talk, okay?

283
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,800
Let's not rush into things. Let's not...

284
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Mr. Mee, right now,

285
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
I think we're jumpin' the gun.

286
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
This is exactly what we've been looking for.

287
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,280
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

288
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
Let's... Let's just take it all in first.

289
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,120
Don't take a gift that's not given
to you yet, now. All right?

290
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,800
This place is perfect.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

291
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,040
Well, that's a bit complicated.

292
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,720
Well, complicated's okay.

293
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,280
Complicated can be great.
We love complicated, right?

294
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,920
- Mmm-hmm.
- What's so complicated about this place?

295
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,320

until two years ago.

for now, you know, just to keep it up.

buy the property
and then just relocate the animals?

316
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,720
Well, actually, the estate is sellin'
the property with the stipulation

317
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,960
that whoever comes on board
and buys the property

318
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
is going to care and maintain
these endangered animals.

- Well.

anything about animals and zoos.

I'm gonna live here. I'm gonna keep you.

(ROSIE GIGGLES)

348
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,320
You look like my brother Dylan.

349
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,800
They're gonna...
They're gonna get all your crackers.

350
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,440
(GIGGLES)

351
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,320
I said "human" interaction.

352
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,960
This is what happens when people have
a you-know-what occur in their lives.

353
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,960
They wake up one day and they say,

354
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,560
"I'm gonna quit my job and try something
completely different with my life."

355
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,400
But then they wake up another day.

356
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
And they say to themselves, "Thank God

357
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,240
"my older brother didn't let me blow
Dad's inheritance

358
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,240
"by buying a broken-down zoo
in the country,

359
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,280
"nine miles from the nearest Target store."

360
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,280
But maybe my older brother
didn't see this place.

361
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,400
- Gracias, Lupe.
- Look.

362
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,920
This is... This is simple destiny.

363
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,440
The place makes 75 % of its revenue
in the summertime.

364
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,520
If I can get an inspection
set for the end of June, right?

365
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll be open by July.

366
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,520
It's only February right now.

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
It's a lot of work, but I think I can do it.

368
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
Duncan, you should have seen Rosie.

369
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,600
Look, do... I'm beggin' you,
do what other people do. Go to Vegas.

370
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,440
Lose a little bit of money.

371
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,200
Or do what I did, when Sheila left me.

372
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,440
Start handicappin' horses?

373
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,480
Well, now, that was a little misguided.

374
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
Go into the commercial shrimping
business and call myself Captain Dunk.

375
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Start cliff diving in Acapulco
at the age of 38.

376
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,880
I miss Sheila, man.

377
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I know, man, I know.

378
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,480
All right, forget that.

379
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,720
Forget all that. Don't do what I did.
Travel the stages of grief.

380
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,440
Yet, stop just before zebras get involved.

381
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,840
It's only two zebras.

382
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,800
And a lion. And a jaguar.

383
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,520
And 47 other species,
seven of which are endangered.

384
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,280
And all of them are saved
the second we make this deal.

385
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,880
The kids are gonna be so psyched.

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,280
- Really? Psyched?
- Yeah.

387
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,080
Are they really gonna be psyched?

388
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,520
You're freakin' kidding me! It's a zoo!

389
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, yeah.

390
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,800
Look, these animals need
somebody to rescue them.

391
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
The... The animals need to be...

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,680

393
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,880
Whoa! Man, you got expelled! All right?

394
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,720
What am I gonna do?
What am I supposed to...

395
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,480
- What, I'm gonna home-school you?
- No.

396
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,480
Right. So what did we talk about?
A new place.

397
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,920
A new start.

398
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,840
This is what you want. It's not what I want!

399
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,680
What?

400
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,920
It's a zoo. I'm moving to a zoo.

401
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,160
We bought a zoo!

402
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,680
Yes, we did. We did buy a zoo.
Give me some fork.

403
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,360
BENJAMIN: All right,
let's let this shirt start over!

404
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,200
Okay, two more left.

405
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,520
A good one. Oldie but a goodie.
What do you think?

406
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,040
Mommy used to wear that sometimes.

407
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,920
She did. This was a...

408
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,560
It started out as mine,
but she kind of adopted it.

409
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,240
But it's got rips and everything
everywhere.

410
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,960
Tough to give some of these
things away, right?

411
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,600
- Keep it?
- It's time.

412
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,960
Let that sweatshirt start over.

413
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,440
Let it start over. Okay. This is it.

414
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,960
Last item.

415
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,520
- Never. That, we're keeping!
- Okay.

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,360
ROSIE: We're here!

417
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,880
Okay, look, the Jaguar Restaurant, guys!

418
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,120

Grab a box, man. Go, go get a box.

422
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,680
Hey, this stuff can go to the kitchen.

423
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,320
Got it, thank you. Hey, look happy. Smile.

424
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,560
Have you even been inside yet?

Okay, guys, this is the whole
storage side of the house!

426
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,680
And we got a back door to the kitchen.

Whoo!

428
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,840
That is a new smell! Wow!

What is that coming from?
Rosie! Come here, look! Dead rats!

430
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,040
See, this is all the snake food, right?

431
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,120
I miss our home.

They're frozen, I guess,
and you feed 'em to the snakes.

Hi. Kelly Foster, Head Zookeeper.

436
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
Right.

This is Robin Jones. Peter MacCready.

- Yep.
- Robin's our craftsman.

439
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,280
And that's Crystal, our capuchin.

440
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
And Peter is our visionary.

441
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,880
He built the enclosures
that set the standards

442
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,280
for modern zoos all across America.

443
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,760
And the world.

444
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,520
Yeah, and the world, yes.

445
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,600
And Peter and Robin do...
Well, they basically do everything.

446
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,120
Except for the books and the telephone.

447
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,640
That's Rhonda over there.

448

This is my cousin Lily. She's 13.
She can't legally work here,

449
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,840

out of my salary.

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,280
Works at the Jaguar. That's it.

Love the house, smells and all. Right?

So I would like to declare us all
modern-day adventurers.

461

And sponsors of animal greatness.

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,160
Okay, terrific. Let's go.

- Dad?
- Yep, got it.

464
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,680
Can we see the otters?
I'd love to see the otters.

465
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,120
And the snakes, and the monkeys.

466
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,280
How old are you?

467
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,520
Fourteen, I guess.

(LAUGHS)

469
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
So, when you get a second,
there's a couple things

470
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,720
I need to go over with you
about the upcoming inspection.

471
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,400
Yeah, the USDA inspector, Walt Ferris.

472
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,920
I'll kill him.

473
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,720
MacCready, stop.

474
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,400
This is Buster. He's our
650-pound North American grizzly.

475
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,400
He was 770, but...
But he's been stressed out.

476
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,520
You know, he's moody. We had him
on Paxil, but can't afford it.

477
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,480
So he's occasionally depressed.

478
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,240
He can still rip your arm off, though.

479
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,840
Hey, there, Buster.
Are you missin' the meds?

480
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,680

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,360
This is Nathan. He does our water and feed.

483
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
- Hey, good to meet you.
- Hi.

484
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,520
Talkin' to the animals has to be
done in a super specific way.

485
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,360
You know, he doesn't have it yet,
but he'll learn.

486
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
Where'd you get your shoes?

487
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,200
And how much did they cost?

488
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,040
You know, we have one Target
and it's nine...

489
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,640
Wait. Wait! Wait, wait!

490
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,720
I thought they would roar
like Solomon the Lion.

491
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,400
No, tigers and lions are very different.

492
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,120
Tigers don't growl or roar, they chuff.

493
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Like...

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
- (CHUFFING)
- Yeah.

496
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,440
When you chuff at them,
they chuff back, see?

Oh, my God.

503
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,800
That guy there, that's Spar.

504
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,320
He's our eldest. He's 17.
He's a Bengal tiger.

505
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,880
You know, tigers have special sensors

506
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,040
in the front of their two-inch canines.

507
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
They can actually detect
the pulse in your aorta.

508
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,880
So when they attack, they bite you,

509
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,000
take your pulse with their teeth,

510
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,840
reposition those suckers and boom,
there goes your carotid.

511
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
Wow.

512
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Yeah.

513
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
So there's a few decisions

514
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,640
you'll have to make straightaway, Ben.

515

Benjamin. Ben was my dad.

516
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,520
Spar, who you just met, the tiger?
He's gonna need some special care,

517

how much longer he's got and I...

00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,600
But I'm just tellin' Kelly here
that she's gotta...

695
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,640
She's gotta go have some time to herself.

696
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,640
So, just tell me what, you know,
just give me a list of what to do,

697
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,400
- and I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

698
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, we got it.

699
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,320
Okay. Spar has a...

700
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,080
A new medication, so let me just...

701
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,680
Make sure that this gets in his food

702
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
- and that he eats it all.
- Okay.

703
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Turn off the lights in the garage.

704
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
The garage.

705
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
There is a new shipment of exotic snakes,

706
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,520
so just leave them in the travel crates

707
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,120
and I'll put them in the exhibit
in the morning.

708
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
And the monkeys need fruit as well.

709
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Go home.

710
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,360
Go out.

711
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,880
Go to the city. Go find your girlfriends.

712
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,680
I think I'll just find my pillow.

713
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
- All right, good night.
- Night.

714
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,880
Oh! That thing.

715
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,360
You wanted me to remember that thing,

716
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,520
- and I...
- Go home.

717
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,160
Okay.

718
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,640
Nine point two miles.

719
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,240
So, technically, that's 18.4 miles for butter.

720
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,360
You know I found some, right?

721
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,280
BENJAMIN: All right, so Rosie and I'll

722
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,280
go to the tiger enclosure
and give them some water.

723
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,880
Why don't you just go over to the garage

724
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,560
and make sure the lights are off
in the side room?

725
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,520
Dad, I have a sick amount
of homework tonight.

726
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,040
Dad!

727
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,560
Get it done!

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,880
He's gonna be okay.

See that? He likes us.

Dylan really loves you, you know?

737
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,880
I know.

738
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,800
He's just mad that
his friends don't visit him here.

739
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,400
He thought they would all visit.
But nobody came.

Could you possibly
point another fan at me?

746
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
You have three fans blowing on you.

747
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,040
I like it.

748
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,520
I can't even find you in there.
You're like a Chilean miner.

749
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,680
We're gonna have to go get

750

Uh-oh! Whose happy is loud?

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,240
Now what do we have here?

760

It's our old friend.

make the trip.

before she had to leave us?

Well, do you remember

765
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,200
the night that we were tucking you in,

766
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,240
and you asked Mommy that?

767
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,200
- No?
- No.

768
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,160
Well, she said...

769
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,040
She said that it looked worse than it felt.

770
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,360
Remember? She said sometimes
people look really sick

771
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,400
but they don't feel really sick.

772
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,520

Yeah.

00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,720

but never with me, which I find funny.

you just changed the subject.

Dylan likes Lily.

Please, she's way younger than me.
She's 12.

It doesn't work like that.

- Yeah.

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,160

- Wow. Wow. Wow.

I don't even know how you did this!

Dad, there's nothin' you could say to me

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,640
that's more harsh than
what I'm sayin' to myself!

821
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,960
Well, I disagree!

822
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,280
I just want you to be happy, man.

823
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,200
Unless you don't want to be happy.

824
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,280
What is so great about being happy?

825
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,720
That you're happy.

826
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,800
I'm sorry I messed up the box of snakes.

827
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,080
Whatever!

to say that in this century.

829
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,160
He's so patronizing to me!

830

- Nice word, hotshot!
- DYLAN: Yeah!

831
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,920
Whatever!

00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,440
(SCREAMING)

833
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,880
KELLY: Now you'll notice here
that I am stringing this cable

834
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
right near the hock, right near the center.

835
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,640
So I'm gonna have you
string up this carcass in a tree.

836
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,640
It's good for the tigers to feel like
they're searching for their food

837
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,000
like they do in the wild.

838
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,080
Awesome.

839
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,320
Hey, I'm pretty sure
this is none of my business,

840
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,760
but I noticed that
your kid really pushes your buttons.

841
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
You give him a lot of rope.

842
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,160
I did not appreciate the way
he kicked that garter snake.

843
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,680
Hey, wait, I feel like I should be
helping you here.

844
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,200
It's all good.

845
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,840
Yeah, look, he's 14,
and he went through somethin'

846
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,000
that no kid should ever have to go through,

847
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,440
so I'm givin' him a little bit of leeway.

848
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,840
Look, honestly, I don't know.

849
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,520
I'm tryin' to figure it out.
There's no manual for what happened.

850
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,560
I mean, a minute ago,
he was into paper airplanes,

851
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,120
and now he's into
portraits of decapitations.

852
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,400
- And they're really good.
- Yeah, well,

853
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,360
what do I know? I still live with my mother.

854
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm not good with people.

855
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,000
You're doing very well.

856
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,560
You know, I expected you to be
heading for the hills by now.

857
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,360
Well, we got through today.

858
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,640
Yeah, we got through today.

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,240
Mayday, mayday! Kelly, do you copy?

862
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,840
- Full alert!
- Copy, full alert.

863
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,040
Contain the dark lord.

864
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Walter Ferris.

865
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,600
BENJAMIN: But no, no, no, no.
He's supposed to come

866
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,040
a week before we open for the inspection.

867
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,280
Well, it looks like he's decided to
pay a hello visit.

868
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,280
Yeah, but we're not even close to ready.

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,800
KELLY: Look, just be yourself.

870
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,240
This is life or death, man.

871
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,800
Okay, got it.

872
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,880
Keep MacCready away from him.
We don't need any bloodshed today.

873
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,320
- MACCREADY: Let me out of here!
- I'm sorry, MacCready!

874
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,000

- Pleasure.

877
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,440
Our inspection happens

878
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,760
a week before we open,
according to my information.

879
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,000
So I've asked for June 30th, which would

880
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,640
get us open by July 7th. 7 /7.

881
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,480
I'm here for a pop by, Mr. Mee.

882
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Great. Let's schedule a pop by.

883
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,800
We've only just
really arrived here, Mr. Ferris.

884
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,440
A pop by, Mr. Mee,
is, by its very definition, a surprise.

885
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,320
I'll be taking notes in preparation
for the actual inspection.

886
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,400
As will I.

887
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,760
Now, we're responsible for the upkeep,
not just the granting of licenses.

888

Welcome to the business of
live-animal maintenance, Mr. Mee.

889
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,600
It's a real fun party.

890
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,240
Where's your zookeeper?

891
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,120
That's me. Kelly.

892
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,320
Hello, Kelly.

893
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,600
I have you down as an assistant.

894
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,800
No formal training?

895
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,040
I moved up.

896
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,480
Oh!

897
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,960
Now why would you buy this place?

898
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,360
I just can't get

899
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,440
a handle on it.

900
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,880
Wow.

901
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,120
You know, actually,

902
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,480
quite a lot's been written about

903
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,560
the innovative design of these enclosures

904
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,840
built by Peter MacCready.

905
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,280
I know all about MacCready.

906
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,680
I've been coming here long before you.

907
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,200
And I know what's in the Jaguar, too.

You're eight inches short.

910
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,720
That's regulation.

911
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,360
New guidelines are being raised this year.

912
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,480
Raise the barrier heights, too.

913
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,480
I'd make that first priority, as well.

914
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,040
I see one of these tigers is 17 years of age?

915
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,640
Yeah, that's Spar, right here.
He had a recent bout

916
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,360
with kidney disease.
That's in remission now.

917
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,840
We're just dealin' with
a little bit of hip dysplasia.

918
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,400
Have you begun to
draw up an end-of-life plan?

919
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,480
Part of the humane care of an animal
is preparing for the inevitable...

920
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,040
He's fine.

921
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,000
We had the vet come out from San Diego,
took a look at him.

922
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,560
So we're all good there.

923
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,920
The endgame on a big cat
can be very costly.

924

I understand, but we're not there yet.

925
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,400
Thank you for your concern.

926
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,600
I guess I just don't understand
how you can call this place home.

927
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,120

Okay, he gave us 12 top-priority items,

932
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,800
two medium-priority. We have one month.

933
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,040
How much of this
can we get done in a month?

934
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,240

936
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,400
I mean, how much is this gonna cost?

937
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,200
I'm gonna have to go take a look around.

938
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,640
You know, go through it
in an itemized way, but,

939
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,160
I mean, you're gonna have to
put some more skin in the game, boss.

940
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,720
How much?

941
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,160
I'd say you're lookin' at
about a buck fifty here.

942
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,720
- Maybe a buck.
- Okay.

He just got here and he's
already thinkin' of quittin'.

1042
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
I'm a big fan of people
being exactly who they are.

1043
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,040
- Exactly.
- So we think alike.

1044
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
We do.

1045
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,440
And if I wanted to be kissed by you,
you wouldn't have a choice.

1046
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,040
Thank you. I think.

1047
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,880
I don't doubt that.

1048
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,160
- What did we just say?
- I don't know.

1049
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,840
Okay.

1050
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,080
(SIGHS)

1051
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,960
It's a lot to take on. All of us.

1052
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,160
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

1053
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,040
RHONDA: It hurts me to tell you this.

1054
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,600
I've been checking his bills.

1055
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,680
The zoo account is empty.

1056
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,000
He has no more money.
He has no idea what he's doing.

1057
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,360
He is going to end up selling
this place to somebody for cheap.

1058
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,000
For the land alone.

1059
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,600
That's right, Robin!

1060
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,680
I am warning you now.

1061
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,520
Behind that front is a front!

1062
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,000
Benjamin Mee is a fraud!

1063
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,840
- Hey.
- DUNCAN: What else you got?

1064
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,680
It's a bad idea. Let me call you back.

1065
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,480
You gotta look at this.
She left a deposit slip.

1066
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,360
And it led me to that.

1067
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,120
Let's go.

1068
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,000
Do you know what she did for you?

1069
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,160
I think so.

1070
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,040
She knew exactly what you would do.

1071
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,680
You'd make a bad investment,
need to start over,

1072
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,240
and have to have a cushion.

1073
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,080
This is your cushion.

1074
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,400
- $84,000, man.
- Oh, my God.

1075
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,440
$84,000.

1076
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,720
It's unbelievable.

1077
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,520
She's still lookin' out for you, man.

1078
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,560
She calls it your circus money.

1079
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,160
Circus money, yeah.

1080
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,520
- This next part's kind of hurtful.
- Yeah.

1081
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,600
It says, "Listen to your heart,
not your brother."

1082
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,360
I know, I read that. She loved you, man.

1083
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,760
She used three exclamation marks.

1084
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,920
She loved you.

1085
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,920
Well, I can see why you still carry the torch.

1086
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,760
Yeah, but with $84,000,
we'll cut a few corners,

1087
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,480
but I know we can make the inspection.

1088
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,440
No, Benji.

1089
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,320
Here's what she's saying.

1090
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,560
You're free. You realize that.

1091
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
Listen.

1092
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,320
Benji.

1093
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,920
You did it, man. You went to the circus.

1094
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,840
You changed Dylan and Rosie's lives.

1095
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,360
They're gonna have
those memories forever.

1096
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,880
But staying here and going down in flames,

1097
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,920
that's not what Katherine wanted.
She wanted you to be free.

1098
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,680
This money is your ticket out.

1099
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,320
And if you won't listen to your brother,
the accountant,

1100
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,160
then listen to your wife

1101
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,680
who clearly planned
a financial future for you.

1102
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,000
Okay.

1103
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,000
Here.

1104
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,640
Thanks.

1105
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,320
I hear you may not be
staying here much longer.

1106
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,320
Seriously?

1107
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,880
Yeah.

1108
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,000
But if you still want to be friends,
you know, I'll still be your friend.

1109
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,480
I mean, there are still cars and all.

1110
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,280
Well, yeah, of course,

1111
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,160
but are you for real with this?

1112
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,880
Oh, yes! This is fantastic.

1113
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,560
I'm goin' home.

1114
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,640
See my friends.

1115
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,800
Hey, listen, I gotta go.

1116
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,480
Don't tell anybody what I heard, okay?

1117
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,360
Sure! Thanks!

1118
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,360
You don't have to leave so fast.

1119
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,080
I'm goin' home.

1120
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,840
It's Rhonda.
She's leavin' for some job in Mexico

1121
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,480
and she just turned everybody against you.

1122
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,400
They're all in there. Says you don't
have any more money, man.

1123
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,520
- She says you're a fraud.
- I got it.

1124
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,920
Well...

1125
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,920
I want to say it has been
an amazing experience here.

1126
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,400
Each of you,
I've come to know in some small way.

1127
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,800
But the financial climate being what it is,

1128
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,760
- (SCOFFS)
- I think none of us thought we'd...

1129
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,920
Well...

1130
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,360
I don't know how to say this.

1131
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,040
I've been an adventure addict
my whole life.

1132
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,600
With no big regard for cost.

1133
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,920
With... Well, with no regard for cost.

1134
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,960
Basically, I was just an observer
and a writer.

1135
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,400
But this is my first real adventure.

1136
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,480
And I just want to say that

1137
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,960
it's been the best one of all
because it's personal.

1138
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,520
And thanks to my Katherine,

1139
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,480
the money came through.

1140
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,520
So, I don't know what you've heard,

1141
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,040
but I am able to say,
though I don't have a lot,

1142
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,520
I do have enough to get us by.

1143
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,160
And if you stick with me,
I will give this everything.

1144
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,200
But I will need everything from you
and we are going to reopen this zoo.

1145
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,640
It is the best job in the world.

1146
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,880
And it's gonna take everything
to make it work.

1147
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,640
So don't... Don't give up on our adventure.

1148
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,520
Well, that's good enough for me.

1149
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,040
- LILY: Me, too.
- Done, man.

1150
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,400
- All right.
- Whoo!

1151
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,360
Yeah!

1152
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,680
Circus money, man.

1153
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,360
Our adventure is just beginning.

1154
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,920
That's not what I meant.

1155
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,120
I know.

1156
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,960
And Rhonda?

1157
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,920
I wish you the best in Mexico.

1158
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,360
I don't speak Spanish.

1159
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,240
Adiós.

1160
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,280
All right.

1161
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,600
(SQUEAKING)

1162
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,800
Cut!

1163
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,800
- All right!
- Almost there, buddy!

1164
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,600
You just get that hat?

1165
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,160
So you woke up this morning
and you thought to yourself...

1166
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,840
It's cold.

1167
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,480
..."I'm gonna put on this hat."

1168
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,320
Why? What do I look like in the hat?

1169
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,720
(LAUGHS)

1170
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,320
I think Spar will like these.

1171
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,320
All right, do we need anything else
while we're in the land of people?

1172
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,920
Nope. I'm good.

1173
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,120
Yeah?

1174
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,560
How come you don't tell stories anymore?

1175
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,840
Well, because we're livin' the story.

1176
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,520
I wish we could tell Mom that.

1177
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,360
You don't think Mom knows?

1178
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,000
I know she knows.

1179
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,800
Me, too.

1180
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,080
Okay. $74.39.

1181
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,280
(EXHALES)

1182
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,840
I don't come up with the prices.

1183
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,200
No, it's not the prices. It's me.

1184
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,560
It's really well worn.

1185
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,400
- It might not work.
- It'll work.

1186
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,560
- It... It'll work.
- No, no, no.

1187
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,720
It's just that it says
"Rosemoor Animal Park".

1188
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,000
- That's the one.
- You work there?

1189
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,480
I do, and I also own it.

1190
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,360
Strange but true.

1191
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,400
- We bought a zoo!
- Throttle down.

1192
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,200
I love that zoo!

1193
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,680
Really?

1194
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,400
Oh, my... We used to go there all the time!

1195
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,280
- Is it gonna open again soon?
- BENJAMIN: Yes.

1196
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
We're gonna open in a few days.

1197
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,880
We're goin' for the 7th, 7 /7.

1198
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,400
7 /7. Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be there.

1199
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,880
You reserve me nine tickets,
'cause I'm gonna bring the in-laws.

1200
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,560
And maybe we could feed
a couple of 'em to the tigers.

1201
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,920
(LAUGHING)

1202
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,160
Thank you so much.

1203
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,800
I'm sorry. Mister! Your bulbs.

1204
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1205
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,600
- 7 /7.
- 7 /7.

1206
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,240
You want to hear somethin' crazy?
I think we're gonna be okay.

1207
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,160
(GROANS)

1208
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,880
Come on, man, we talked about this.

1209
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,800
You gotta eat that food to get all the meds.

1210
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,120
You know, there's a major buzz
waitin' for you inside that meat.

1211
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,760
Your neurotransmitters are gonna be firin'

1212
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,320
all the way to the moon and back.

1213
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,680
You'll be dating seven-year-olds.

1214
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,600
Have every house cat from here to El Cajon.

1215
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,320
Buddy, if you don't eat the food

1216
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,480
- and you don't get your medicine,
- (SNARLING)

1217
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,800
it all goes downhill very fast.

1218
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,520
I'm tellin' you the truth.

1219
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,600
Trust me.

1220
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,440
Come on, man, we're almost there.

1221
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,520
You gotta stick with me.

1222
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,320
We got opening day comin' up.

1223
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,560
He's fine. He's okay.

1224
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,000
- Hey.
- He got up there and can't come down.

1225
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,200
Well, can we use the ladder?

1226
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,040
We tried luring him with food.

1227
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,360
He's gotta come down from there.

1228
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,960
He's gotta eat his food,
he's gotta drink water,

1229
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,080
he's gotta take his medication.

1230
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,320
He's dehydrated.

1231
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,600
I mean, we've gotta
get him into the enclosure.

1232
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,520
Are the other two inside?

1233
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,840
- Benjamin!
- Look, if he moves to attack me,

1234
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,240
at least he'll be moving, right?

1235
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,840
- He's slow, I can outrun him.
- It's not a bullfight.

1236
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,520
Benjamin!

1237
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,560
I think it's time.

1238
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,600
For what?

1239
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,880
He's ready. Let's call the vet.

1240
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,680
You're the owner. You have to okay this.

1241
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,920
No, man.

1242
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,440
Look, this doesn't feel right.

1243
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,120
Benjamin, it never feels right.

1244
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,440
- Stuck?
- Yeah, stuck. He's stuck.

1245
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,160
- Anybody, ideas?
- Loud noises scare the big cats.

1246
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,720
Loud noises scare the big cats.

1247
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,800
Wait. Hold on.

1248
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,880
LILY: We can scare him
into goin' back in.

1249
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,240
That's a good idea. All right,

1250
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,400
- when I give the signal...
- Hey, hold on a sec.

1251
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,320
...you guys just yell, scream,
make as much noise as possible.

1252
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,720
Spar's gonna hate it,
but maybe he'll come down.

1253
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,880
I don't know. It's our only option.

1254
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,160
- Hold on.
- KELLY: So, guys, get pots, pans,

1255
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,400
stuff like that, okay?

1256
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,000
Nathan? Nathan, go to two.

1257
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,560
Nathan? Nathan, wake up!

1258
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,960
- (ALL SHOUTING)
- Come on, get off!

1259
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,680
ROBIN: Get off of there, Spar!

1260
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,760
MAN: We love you, Spar!

1261
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,640
Come on! Come down, Spar!
Come on down!

1262
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,920
Come on, honey, come down for us!

1263
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,520
Come on, get down, Spar! Get down!

1264
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,640
Come on, Spar! Come on, come on!

1265
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,120
Get down off the rock, Spar!

1266
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,680
Come on down!

1267
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,280
Come on, hotshot, come on!

1268
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,040
Would you just do what's good for you?
Will you listen and get off the rock?

1269
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,160
Would you just listen sometimes
and do what's good for you?

1270
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,800
- Come on, Spar! Come on!
- You're an animal! You can't do this to me!

1271
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,440
Come on, baby!

1272
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,200
That's it! That's it, that's it! Go, go there!

1273
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,960
BENJAMIN: Get off the rocks!
Get off the rocks!

1274
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,440
(ALL CHEERING)

1275
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,840
Do you think I want to do this by myself?

1276
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,240
Do you think I want to come out here

1277
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,880
and drag you out here?

1278
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,960
I did it because I was desperate!

1279
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,240
Benjamin?

1280
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,240
Hey, look, I'm feelin'
a real lack of privacy right now.

1281
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,240
Like, maybe we're all a bit
in each other's pockets.

1282
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,080
Can't you see his legs? He's suffering, man.

1283
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,600
He's in a lot of pain.
I can't stand to watch it.

1284
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,920
- I know him. I see it.
- Yeah, I mean, I know him.

1285
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,640
Hey! Hey.

1286
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,480
He's in so much pain.

1287
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,880
They can't tell you, but they show you.
You know, they show you.

1288
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,000
Well, hang on.
What is all the cheering about, then?

1289
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,560
- He's okay.
- It's going to happen.

1290
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,720
He's better.

1291
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,240
It's going to happen.

1292
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,280
- Don't repeat it to me like I'm a kid.
- It's going to happen.

1293
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,680
You've never done this before!
You don't know how this goes!

1294
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,360
I know exactly how this goes.

1295
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,800
And I invite you to
tell me about that sometime.

1296
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,240
But this is a rookie mistake.

1297
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,680
I've been with him for 13 years.

1298
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,920
You can't see how selfish this is,

1299
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,240
to extend this?
Come on, you're too smart not to.

1300
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,200
I'm saying, we just let him live
for a couple more weeks.

1301
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,400
Get him some medicine and
invest in a little bit of hope!

1302
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,840
No, I can't stand by and watch this happen!

1303
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,440
- I'm not gonna do it!
- Well, it's not up to you.

1304
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,640
It's gonna happen.

1305
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,720
Don't make me get angry.

1306
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,560
'Cause that would just
be so terrible, if you got angry.

1307
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,080
You know what the right thing to do is!

1308
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,760
I'm so disappointed in you.

1309
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,000
Well, you don't even
know me well enough to say that!

1310
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,600
Hi, Lucy.
When are you gonna have those babies?

1311
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,160
Hey, Rosie. Your dad around?

1312
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,920
He said he was goin' to think.
He does that sometimes.

1313
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,000
You guys makin' dinner?

1314
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,600
- No.
- Well, let me help you.

1315
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,680
- I'll order a pizza or something.
- No, look, it's fine.

1316
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,760
Look, Dad'll be back soon.
He's just having a mood.

1317
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,760
KELLY: Yeah? How long do those last?

1318
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,520
A couple of years.

1319
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400
Pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza.

1320
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,880
Smells good.

1321
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,560
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1322
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,400
- You miss Lily?
- Me?

1323
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,480
- No.
- I bet you put all your feelings

1324
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,960
- into your drawings?
- Nah, not really.

1325
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,880
I guess I just can't talk to girls that well?

1326
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,000
Well, talkin' to girls is easy.
They'll tell you everything.

1327
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,520
The secret to talking is listening.

1328
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,120
I thought if I came out here it would stop.

1329
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,680
Back home, every place
reminded me of her.

1330
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,200
Filippe's on Third Street. Balboa Park.

1331
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,920
Little Dom's, the coffee shop,
that... That's a big one.

1332
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,280
I mean, the air,
the way it smelled in May and August,

1333
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,640
because those were the months that her

1334
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,480
favorite bushes grew flowers
all over our neighborhood.

1335
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,160
They're all triggers, man.

1336
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,600
And it got better for a while.

1337
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,280
I mean, it... It did, out here.

1338
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,320
But the funny thing is that

1339
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,440
it just turns out that she's here, too.

1340
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,520
I mean, I go to Home Depot.
I go to the nine-miles-away Target.

1341
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,720
We need a new store.

1342
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,000
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1343
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,320
And seriously, I'm avoiding half the aisles.

1344
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,800
Condiments.

1345
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,440
Pastries, forget about it.

1346
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,720
She loved red kites
and blueberry Pop-Tarts.

1347
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,440
I mean, who doesn't, right?

1348
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,640
Who doesn't?

1349
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,160
If only I could talk to her
about getting over her.

1350
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,920
Yeah.

1351
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,000
And most of all, it's the kids.
They're the biggest triggers of all.

1352
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,240
BENJAMIN: I mean, Dylan. His eyes.

1353
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,920
You know, I've only seen
that expression in somebody's eyes

1354
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,920
once in my life.

1355
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,000
And the way he just drives me nuts,
he makes me crazy.

1356
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,280
Denies me, frustrates me.

1357
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,840
And all the time,
he's looking back at me with her eyes.

1358
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,160
And none of her lightness.

1359
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:16,640
What I've figured out is that
when you love somebody that much,

1360
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,360
that hard, that long,

1361
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,000
you can never get away from them,
no matter where you go.

1362
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,200
And that only comes

1363
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,400
once in a lifetime.

1364
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,840
Just can't get a handle on it.

1365
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,320
I cannot let go.

1366
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,200
I can.

1367
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,560
Sleep well, Benjamin. Sweet dreams.

1368
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,680
I get it now, okay?
I get why you can't stand me!

1369
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,000
Okay. All right.

1370
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,240
No. At least now I know the real reason
why you hate me!

1371
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,880
Look, I heard you admit it to her.

1372
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,920
Like you were talking about cornflakes.

1373
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,240
You hate me!

1374
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,000
I hate you? Wait a second.

1375
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,920
Okay, we've had some problems, man,
but we're figurin' it out, okay?

1376
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,560
That is bullshit!

1377
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,240
Admit it! You wish I wasn't here!

1378
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,440
With that expression in my eyes?

1379
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,920
I heard you!

1380
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,480
Hold on! Enough with the drama! All right?

1381
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,600
Knock it off! You misheard me!

1382

I can't stand it here!
Look, can't you see that?

No, but thank you for telling me, again!

Why don't I just pack us up?
We'll just go on the road together.

1386
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,720
We could be hobos.

1387
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,640
Because you wasted all our money!

1388
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,440
Some of that belonged to me, Dad!

1389
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,440
I didn't waste our money.
I thought you liked it here.

1390
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,760
And I'm sorry, I thought your friends
would come out and visit you, man.

I called them all myself and I invited 'em.

I thought this was
a dream come true for us!

It's your dream!

1398
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,880
You can't force a dream
onto someone else, Dad!

1399
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,960
Yes, I can!

1400
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,720
- I can force a dream on you!
- Why are you yelling?

1401

Because it's a good dream!

1402

And it's got cool animals in it
and some pretty great people, too!

and feel sorry for yourself, man!

You never even taught me how to shave.

01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,040
BENJAMIN: I want to get a shot of that.

1719
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,360
ROSIE: I'll get a close-up on your nose.

1720
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,160
Me, too.

1721
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,600
People! (LAUGHS)

1722
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,600
- You goofball.

(GROWLS)

1725
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,640
- We bought a zoo.
- We did that.

1726
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:56,720
(CHUCKLES)

1727
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,120
BENJAMIN: Do you remember
what you told me when I was a kid?

1728
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,520
DUNCAN: You only have to be courageous
for 20 seconds.

1729
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,000
BENJAMIN: It has guided me my entire life.

1730
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,080
- All right. Ladies first.
- Where are we going?

1731
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,760
Now, hang on. So, okay. Stop.

1732
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,240
She was

1733
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,080
right there.

1734
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:23,760
This is the moment where both of you
became a possibility.

1735
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,920
I love that you're telling stories again.

1736
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,720
This is the story before the story.

1737
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,720
This is where you and you begin.

1738
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,880
Because this is where I met your mom.

1739
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:39,400
She was sitting right there in that chair.

1740
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,640
Hang on.

1741
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,840
Hey, hey. So,

1742
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,360
I was walkin' by.

1743
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:00,000
And I saw her and I literally stopped,
like this, just stopped.

1744
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:02,840
And went, "Oh, my God.

1745
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:07,000
"That is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen in my entire life."

1746
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,480
But I've never done anything like this.

1747
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,440
I'd never gone and talked
to a total stranger before.

1748
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,760
But she was right there.

1749
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:18,160
And so I thought to myself,
"20 seconds." Right?

1750
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:20,800
Go.

1751
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,200
Now I'm in the restaurant. And I'm terrified.

1752
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,160
Thinkin' about leaving.

1753
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,840
I can actually touch her. She's right there.

1754
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,640
She still hasn't seen me.

1755
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,400
And I still have 15 seconds of courage left.

1756
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,480
I'm goin' for it.

1757
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,200
Bravery.

1758
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,640
Here's what I said.

1759
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,480
What?

1760
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,760
(SIGHS)

1761
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,640
I said,

1762
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,800
"Excuse me."

1763
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,520
Hi, Mom.

1764
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,080
Hi, Mommy.

1765
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,560
"Why would an amazing woman like you

1766
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:41,040
"even talk to someone like me?"

1767
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:48,960
(CHUCKLES)

1768
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:50,960
Why not?

1769
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,640
(GATHERING STORIES PLAYING)

1770
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,000
And then I heard you

1771
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,960
You made me long for

1772
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,360
To be a part of

1773
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:52,040
Something that I can't see

1774
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,000
A life that is beyond

1775
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,760
Something that I can't fear

1776
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,760
To be a part of

1777
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,600
The story, it belongs to you

1778
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:26,440
Something you said burns

1779
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:29,520
Apart the pen and the paper

1780
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,520
You can't always write it

1781
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:38,120
It is something you have to do

1782
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,080
Gathering stories

1783
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,880
A story, it belongs to you

They say that it's gone now

1785
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:53,320
You know that I disagree

1786
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:12,560
I barely hear you

1787
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,720
Your signal is cold now

1788
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,080
So turn me into

1790

To all our favorite songs

1793
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,160
Your signal is growing

1794
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,960
Out in little pieces

1795
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:02,120
And watch in a moment

1796
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,480
Secure it for falling

1797
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,080
Over the stars

1798
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,080

Over the days

1802
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,880
Over the streams

1803
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,720
Over the skies

1804
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,600
Over the ponds

1805
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:27,440
Over the fires

1806
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,520
Over the lakes

1807
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,360
Over the trees

1808
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,240
Over the minds

1809

Over the doors

02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,800
I am alive
