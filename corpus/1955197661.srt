1
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,873
Glad you could make it.

2
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,975
Yeah, well, if you have
what you say you have,

3
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,278
boss'll do more business.

4
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,646
First show me the money,

5
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,547
then we can talk business.

6
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,975
Clean, and uncut.

7
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,677
Straight from the source.

8
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,852
This man right here is in charge
of FDA approval.

9
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,025
I usually prefer ecstasy,
but, uh...

10
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,562
I'm an equal opportunity
kind of guy.

11
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,913
We're under attack!

12
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,567
Shit.

13
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,837
Over a dozen gang members
are dead

14
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,040
in what can only be
described as a massacre.

15
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,743
Early reports indicate
that several of the victims

16
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:09,080
were wanted in connection with a variety of
other violent crimes throughout the city.

17
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,049
Now if you take a look
behind me here,

18
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,785
you can see that most of them...

19
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,251
Morning, Captain.

20
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,621
With all this media circus,
is it?

21
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,791
What the hell happened here?

22
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,026
- Drug deal gone wrong?
- Very wrong.

23
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,796
They forgot to take the drugs.

24
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,798
Think Vincent Romano
is behind this?

25
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,667
Isn't he behind everything?

26
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,671
So, who are the victims today?

27
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,273
It's a mess.

28
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,776
Buddy's laying over here and
what's left of the 1st Streeters,

29
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,312
which, as you know,
up until last night

30
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,082
were the most vicious,
violent gang in the city,

31
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:21,653
responsible for more rapes and murders
than your average Third World army.

32
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:25,290
Over here, we've got the remains
of the Whiteboys,

33
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,392
white supremacist version
of the 1st Streeters,

34
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:30,929
only these guys got cash and mob
ties to back 'em up.

35
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,966
All the upstanding citizens
of society.

36
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,270
Yeah, most of them were shot.
One of them was blown up.

37
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,072
One got a knife to the throat.

38
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:53,051
Whatever happened here, somebody
walked away with a lot of money.

39
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,820
Not exactly, sir.

40
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,822
How much is in there?

41
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,726
Enough to say that someone
is very unhappy.

42
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,025
Smoking cigars now, hm.

43
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,928
And I thought he was perfect.

44
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,472
Put your hands on your head
and turn around real slow.

45
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,076
Let me guess,

46
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,780
you're pointing a standard police-issue
nine millimeter Glock at me?

47
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,916
Holds 15 rounds in the mag,

48
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,252
16 if you count the one
that's not in the chamber.

49
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,355
It's nothing any run-of-the-mill
Kevlar vest wouldn't stop.

50
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:09,194
The irony is, your academy training
has you pointing at my torso,

51
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,261
not my head.

52
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,966
Last chance.

53
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,105
Relax, Detective,
I'm on your side.

54
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,373
It is Detective, isn't it?

55
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:27,412
I'm just assuming the patrol officer
would have some sort of age requirement.

56
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,015
- Who are you?
- Special Agent William Porter.

57
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,419
I'm also gonna take a gamble
that that Glock isn't gonna

58
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,355
shoot me before
I can show you my ID.

59
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,126
Fuck!

60
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:45,130
What are you doing here anyway?
This isn't a federal case.

61
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,768
He's using this rooftop
as a staging ground.

62
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,936
Tell me, which him?

63
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,539
You'd need a small army
to take out these two gangs.

64
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,975
You know, I'm thinking several
guys with machine guns?

65
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,244
A couple of knife men
in the alley,

66
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,112
bomber to take out the Mercedes,

67
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,984
spotter or two on the roof, so
come on, tell me, how many hims?

68
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,052
It's just one.

69
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,262
What happened to the drugs?

70
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,231
Where's the money, Ex?

71
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,068
I... I don't know.

72
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,207
I need to see a doctor!

73
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:46,157
You're gonna keep on bleeding until
we understand what happened here.

74
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,228
Mr. Romano isn't very happy.

75
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,188
Who did this?

76
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,924
I didn't see any faces.

77
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,996
They were everywhere,
they were all around us.

78
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,167
Who would do this to you?

79
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,105
Get rid of him.

80
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,217
Who would do this to us?

81
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,487
There's no other cartel strong
enough to pull this off.

82
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,204
<i>Good evening.
Recent crimes rates in our city</i>

83
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,506

<i>has contacted Mayor Randolph's

87
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,118
<i>however it appears that Mayor Randolph's

88
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,220
<i>seems to be the only thing

89

<i>other than defending numerous

90
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,259
<i>As of this time, the mayor
has declined to comment</i>

91
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,561
<i>or return our calls. Erin?</i>

92
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,365
<i>Erin, we have breaking news from the
old missile silo on the edge of town.</i>

93

<i>Reports are coming in that a
violent, yet selective assassination</i>

94

<i>of known gang members and drug

95
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,975
<i>What we know at this time is that
several cars were riddled with bullets</i>

96
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,244
<i>and one vehicle exploded with

97

<i>that its make

98
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,481
<i>Moreover the crime scene
is littered with corpses</i>

99
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,984
<i>and body parts so mutilated
and scattered,</i>

100
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,720
<i>that the police have yet to
establish an accurate body count.</i>

101
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,390
<i>Our city's Police Captain Connolly and
several detectives are on the scene.</i>

102
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,226
<i>Additionally, our Channel 4 News copter
has been in the air all morning.</i>

103
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:06,130
<i>We will bring you updated details
as they become available.</i>

104
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,330
How bad is he?

105
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,333
Oh, poor baby.

106
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,537
Tell him Mommy will be there
as soon as she can.

107
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,107
Get your pants off, Keri.

108
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,775
You're on next.

109
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,644
Thank you.

110
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,418
Hey, Natasha?

111
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,554
Hi, Keri.
What's going on?

112
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,423
My son got sick at school.

113
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,125
Can you cover for me?

114
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,193
Of course.

115
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,761
Tell the little guy
I hope he feels better.

116
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,598
Thank you.
You're a life-saver.

117
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,399
What do you want me
to tell Jack?

118
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,336
They'll be only two of us until
the shift change.

119
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,205
I know, I'm sorry.

120
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,642
Tell him...
I'll be back as soon as I can.

121
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:12,216
Oh, and the scary guy
in the back isn't tipping.

122
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,484
What does he look like?

123
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,287
I don't know, I didn't
get a good look at him.

124
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,290
Well, he hasn't seen me yet.

125
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,592
<i>Good evening. Not even
24 hours has passed</i>

126
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,262
<i>and we find our Channel 4 News

<i>Breaking news, Channel 4

130
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,472

131
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,974
<i>We are hearing that an apparent
bomb or other incendiary device</i>

132

<i>has annihilated this building.</i>

133
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,479
<i>Bomb squad officials report

<i>could cause a destruction
of this magnitude.</i>

135
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,816
<i>And it is assumed to have been
remotely detonated.</i>

136
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,618
<i>The question remains,</i>

137
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,654
<i>who would be capable of getting
a hold of such a device?</i>

138
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,923
Raise it up.
There you go.

139
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,792
More to the left.

140
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,796
Here you go, miss.

141
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,604
Did you find any
other bodies inside?

142
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,773
This is Jerry Simon
coming to you live

143
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,375
from the charred remains
of the Snake Eyes Strip Club.

144
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,912
It seems that our fair city, which
just last night played host

145
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,382
to the bloody massacre of two of
our most violent street gangs,

146
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,985
must now bear witness
to the fiery destruction

147
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,988
of its most notorious
strip club.

148
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,930
Girls said they were the only
dancers in the club at the time.

149
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,932
Luckily it was between shifts.

150
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,002
- They see anything?
- No, they were in the dressing room.

151
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,806
That building was filled
with weapons and ammunition.

152
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,607
There's gonna be
a lot of dead in there.

153
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,711
The 1st Streeters, the Whiteboys,
now the Snake Eyes Club.

154
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:30,681
Are we looking for someone to
arrest or to thank, Rodriguez?

155
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,383
Captain's been to more crime
scenes today

156
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,552
than he has all year.

157
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,587
You can say that again.

158
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:43,394
Well, it looks like somebody turned off
the alarm over the emergency exit.

159
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,696
Not that it would've mattered.

160
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,399
Fire boys are telling me they're
pretty sure it was a bomb.

161
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,700
Destroyed everything
but the dressing room.

162
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,403
That's some serious
precision bombing.

163
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:57,475
So, what are the chances this
is connected to last night?

164
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,511
Yeah, I'd say "pretty good".

165
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,083
Excuse me.
Oh, my God...

166
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,452
Miss! Miss,
you have to stay back.

167
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,854
I was just here.

168
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,056
- Okay.
- You have to stay back.

169
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,189
Excuse me, miss?

170
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,725
- What is your name?
- Who are you?

171
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,495
My name is William Porter,
I'm a federal agent.

172
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,130
Did you work here today?

173
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,900
- Who said I work here?
- Come on.

174
00:23:55,902 --> 00:24:00,504
I assume you didn't come all the way
down here in those shoes to go jogging.

175
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:04,775
I was just here a few hours ago.

176
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,944
It was the scary guy
in the back, wasn't it?

177
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,448
You saw someone?
Did you see his face?

178
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,017
No.

179
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,687
Come on.

180
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,926
Agent Porter,
what can I do for you?

181
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,694
Well, you might
want to talk to her.

182
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,896
She was here earlier today.

183
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,842
It's him.

184
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,059
Hey!

185
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,662
What the hell's going on, man?

186
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,865
Who were you chasing?

187
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:07,838
His name is
Colonel Robert Sikes.

188
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,875
He's a commander of one of the
Special Forces' most elite units.

189
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,576
His service record is
impeccable.

190
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,011
Skills at hand-to-hand combat,

191
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:18,182
weapons, firearms, and
explosives is unmatched.

192
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,719
He's trained to blend in
to any city, any terrain.

193
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,787
And he's using those skills and
that training

194
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,156
to go after gangs,
or drug dealers,

195
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,025
or anyone who, in his mind,

196
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,161
is threatening the moral fabric
and well-being of this country.

197
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,230
A vigilante.

198
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,732
He's more than that, Captain.

199
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,700
This is a military mission
to him.

200
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,803
His targets, wide-ranging as
they may seem, are not random.

201
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:43,774
They are carefully chosen
for maximum effectiveness.

202
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,976
So, what, he's looking at these
gangs as insurgents?

203
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,813
Well, the strip club was a,
uh, supply depot.

204
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,682
What about the dancers?

205
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,617
They weren't his targets.

206
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,753
If he wanted them dead,
they'd be dead.

207
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,856
You seem to know a lot about
this Colonel Sikes.

208
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:02,860
Would you mind telling us why "a commander
of an elite Special Forces unit"

209
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,896
is on a military mission
to save our city?

210
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,767
While Colonel Sikes was hunting
down terrorists in Afghanistan,

211
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,803
his wife and little boy,
safe here at home,

212
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:16,874
were killed in a drive-by
shooting, completely random.

213
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,777
The killer was aiming for
a rival gang member.

214
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,947
And Sikes' wife and little boy
just happened to be nearby.

215
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,748
His wife died almost instantly

216
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,051
and the little boy lingered on
for a few more days

217
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,719
before joining his mother.

218
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,354
Did they ever catch
the shooters?

219
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:33,924
No, there were so many suspects,

220
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,827
the police couldn't even determine
which gang was responsible.

221
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,663
But it didn't matter anyway,
Sikes had already snapped

222
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:43,667
and begun his self-ordered
mission to secure the homeland.

223
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:47,771
What else should we know
about this guy?

224
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,074
Well, he doesn't drink,
he doesn't do drugs,

225
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,943
he doesn't sleep around,
and, until recently,

226
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,613
he didn't smoke, either.

227
00:26:55,615 --> 00:27:00,084
Well, we appreciate very much all
that information, Agent Porter.

228
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,152
We'll catch him.

229
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,321
Well, I hope you're right.

230
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,224
But, uh, no offense, Captain,

231
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,060
I don't think that your
department is skilled,

232
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:13,964
equipped, or trained enough to
deal with Colonel Sikes.

233
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,233
He's been on Special Ops
missions all around the world,

234
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,836
usually with entire armies
chasing him down.

235
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,672
And they don't have to yell
"freeze".

236
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,274
So what makes you so qualified
for the job?

237
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,911
I've been in those places
with him.

238
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,687
Hey!

239
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,860
So are we supposed to arrest
everyone with a buzz cut,

240
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,195
or are you gonna tell us what
this guy looks like?

241
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:49,833
I already requested the Pentagon
send over Sikes' picture and file,

242
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,169
at least whatever's
not classified,

243
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,971
not that it'll help.

244
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,372
He'll have already changed
appearances.

245
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,174
Aw, this is such bullshit.

246
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:03,213
Listen to me, Sikes is trained
to be a ghost, a shadow.

247
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:07,051
When this is all over, you might
even wonder if he ever existed.

248
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,920
Now if you'll excuse me,
Detective,

249
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,722
I gotta go find the girl
that you lost.

250
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,990
I lost?

251
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,458
You're the one who drew
your gun and ran away

252
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,727
and knocked over those innocent
civilians.

253
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,896
She's a witness.

254
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,131
The police still do use
witnesses, don't they?

255
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,300
Look, asshole,

256
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:27,037
I don't give a shit whether you
work for the government or not.

257
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,173
Until this becomes
a federal case,

258
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,874
you're just a tourist here.

259
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,177
Sikes is trained to leave
a survivor,

260
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,914
to scare people out of doing
whatever it is they're doing.

261
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:40,050
Now this girl, Keri,
she's a random variable.

262
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,187
If he let her escape,
he could be following her.

263
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,989
If she escaped on her own,
she could be a target.

264
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,227
Assuming she is telling you the truth, all
you know is that this girl's a stripper.

265
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,229
You don't even know
her last name.

266
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,965
Well, I'm gonna find her...

267
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,000
perhaps even before
she's killed.

268
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,337
So what do you expect me to do, sit on
my ass and wait for you to save the day?

269
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,774
- Safest place for your ass.
- Fuck you.

270
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,976
I'll keep in touch.

271
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,785
Turn around, smart ass!
Put your hands up!

272
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,454
Get up against the wall.

273
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,300
- Hey, homey, don't say anything!
- Shut up!

274
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,702
Don't be looking around,
look straight ahead.

275
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,172
Spread your legs.

276
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,776
Let's get this shit off of you.

277
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,218
- Oh, come on!
- Come here! Get your ass over here!

278
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,083
Partner,
shots fired! Shots fired!

279
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,152
- Get down!
- Put out a help call!

280
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,987
Officer needs help!
Officer needs help!

281
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:53,524
Send an ambulance! Shots fired,
I got two suspects down.

282
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:59,163
Officer needs help.
Officer needs help.

283
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,025
The Snake Eyes Club
is completely destroyed.

284
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:54,017
I want to know who did this.

285
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,020
I talked to the two strippers at
the hospital.

286
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,057
They're lucky to be alive.

287
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,559
Weird.

288
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:07,097
But they said she left
just before the explosion.

289
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:17,307
She even talked about seeing some scary
guy in the back of the strip club.

290
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,358
Where is she?

291
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,494
There were too many cops around
to pick her up.

292
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,499
We'll get her, though.

293
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,675
I want this girl here...

294
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,011
now.

295
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,075
Breaking and entering's
against the law.

296
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,379
And I could even tell you how
much time you'd get for that.

297
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:47,090
Now look, I don't want any
trouble with you boys.

298
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,420
- You have a good day, honey.
- Okay.

299
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,524
And when you get home, we are
gonna go on a little trip.

300
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,394
Just you and Mommy.

301
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:00,363
It will be like
our little adventure.

302
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,133
- All right?
- Okay.

303
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,536
I love you.

304
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,205
I love you, too.

305
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,261
Asshole.

306
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:39,903
Yo, where's my money, bitch?

307
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,305
Hey, nice to see you, too.

308
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,640
Uh-huh.

309
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,510
Here you go.

310
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,448
Shit, that's all you got?

311
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,682
Just give me my cut.

312
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,785
Your cut? You know,
you need to be working more.

313
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,356
I'm just doing this
till I get back on my feet.

314
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,825
Hah-hah, back on your feet!

315
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,579
Oh, my God!

316
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,714
Captain Connely.

317
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,485
When?

318
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,393
- Weren't we just here?
- Yeah, you know me and strip clubs, Rodriguez.

319
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,462
So let's pan up the blood.

320
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,932
Tag his face, and then
we'll whip over to the neck.

321
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,369
Uh, the wound on the neck.

322
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:23,273
And then we'll pull back out
for the wide.

323
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,447
- Beautifully gratuitous.
- Hey!

324
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,415
What the hell
are you doing here?

325
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,851
Hi, Detective, Jerry Simon,
<i>Jerry Simon Says.</i>

326
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,686
It looks like you've a few more
dead bodies back there.

327
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,288
I don't care if you're the Pope.

328
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,623
This is a crime scene.
Get the hell outta here.

329
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,925
- The body count is rising...
- Guys!

330
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,860
It looks like they were killed
with a very big knife.

331
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,562
You should make a statement,
Detective or I'll make one for you.

332
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,864
Hey, please don't touch him!
Okay, we're leaving.

333
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,333
1st Streeters, the Whiteboys,
this club and now these two.

334
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,435
I think you've got a vigilante
on your hands.

335
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,707
- No comment.
- Thank you, Detective.

336
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,409
Okay, we're leaving.

337
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,458
This is just the beginning,
isn't it?

338
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:26,736
<i>This is Jerry Simon coming to
you live for a special report.</i>

339
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,839
<i>I find myself again outside of
the Snake Eyes strip club,</i>

340
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,809
<i>which just yesterday exploded
in a fiery blast,</i>

341
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,611
<i>killing almost everyone inside.</i>

342
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,913
<i>But this morning,
two more bodies were found,</i>

343
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,516
<i>each killed at some point
last night</i>

344
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,385
<i>outside of the very same club.</i>

345
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:46,656
<i>Although the police are denying it, this reporter
believes it to be the work of a vigilante.</i>

346
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,859
<i>A "super-vigilante,"
if you will.</i>

347
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,396
<i>He first targeted the violent 1st
Streeters and Whiteboy gangs.</i>

348
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,632
<i>He then moved on to the
notorious Snake Eyes club,</i>

349
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,033
<i>which you can
still see behind me.</i>

350
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,635
<i>And now, he hunts the muggers</i>

351
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:01,538
<i>and criminals that
infest our streets.</i>

352
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,940
<i>It is unknown if this
crime wave will end.</i>

353
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,975
<i>If you ask me,
the modus operandi</i>

354
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,712
<i>of this vigilante will escalate
until our peaceful hamlet</i>

355
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,780
<i>is washed of these
vicious criminals.</i>

356
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,383
<i>The footage that</i>
Jerry Simon Says

357
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,652
<i>is about to show is gruesome.</i>

358
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,587
<i>But it's the truth.</i>

359
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,622
<i>I advise any children
out there watching</i>

360
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,525
<i>to do so with extreme caution.</i>

361
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,896
Those are the two crack heads
I had watching the place.

362
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,833
I didn't think anyone
would actually go back.

363
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:33,670
<i>Let me take you live to</i>
<i>the</i> Jerry Simon Says<i> studios.</i>

364
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:38,441
I am about to share with you
some expert observations

365
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,877
that clearly raise questions.

366
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,914
And this bastard
used a hunting knife?

367
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,685
Two of them.
Without blinking.

368
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:51,888
<i>...and the most recent bombing
of the Snake Eyes strip club.</i>

369
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,591
Folks, when you've been
an Emmy Award-winning journalist

370
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,559
as long as Jerry Simon has,

371
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,429
you develop eyes
in the back of your head.

372
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:00,697
Case in point.

373
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,767
To me, this gentleman
is a person of interest

374
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:07,437
and somebody needs to
find him and talk to him.

375
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,607
<i>Furthermore, my gut instinct
begs the question,</i>

376
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:15,712
<i>why is he so chummy with this
single mother/seductive stripper...</i>

377
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:19,082
- That's him.
<i>- ...who miraculously survived.</i>

378
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,619
Uh, sir, I'm not
so sure about that.

379
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,487
Why is that?

380
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,089
I've seen this guy
around before.

381
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,559
- Where?
- With the police...

382
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:32,195
I think he's a cop,
maybe even a Fed.

383
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:36,599
Feds don't kill people
with hunting knives.

384
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:40,637
That's him.

385
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,505
And when you bring that
little bitch in here,

386
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,507
I'm sure she'll tell me
the same thing.

387
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:48,545
Mac and the boys are
picking her up right now.

388
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,652
I'll scream.

389
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,654
I hope for nothing less.

390
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,923
We work for Vincent Romano.

391
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,694
We're here to ask
a few questions...

392
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:41,798
and for your sake,
we better like the answers.

393
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:47,904
Now put down the fucking knife!

394
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,192
You remember Mr. Romano?

395
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,694
Your old boss
at the Snake Eyes club?

396
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,198
Yes, but I was hired by Jack.

397
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,701
I didn't do any
of that other stuff.

398
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,737
Haven't you been watching
the news this week?

399
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:24,741
It's not safe anymore for
people in your profession.

400
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,210
Yours either.

401
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,860
You going on a little trip?

402
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,162
Just... just a weekend getaway.

403
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,602
But it's not the weekend yet.

404
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,342
Why go away when we can...

405
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,779
party right here?

406
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,849
We want to know about
the bombing.

407
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,721
I don't know anything.

408
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,760
She doesn't know anything.

409
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:31,074
We don't believe you, Keri!

410
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:34,110
There was a man
sitting at the back.

411
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:38,247
But I didn't see his face.
I swear.

412
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,950
It's not me
you need to convince...

413
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,686
it's Mr. Romano.

414
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,127
Answer it.

415
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,102
You try anything stupid,
you die,

416
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,204
and so does your kid.

417
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,344
- Who is it?
- Special Agent Porter.

418
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:11,881
We met outside
the Snake Eyes club.

419
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:20,823
I believe we have some
unfinished business to discuss.

420
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:23,993
It's not a good time.

421
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,967
Never is.

422
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,065
Are there any more?

423
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:06,936
- Are there any more?
- No.

424
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,971
Are you okay?

425
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,714
Where's your little boy?

426
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,482
He's at school.

427
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:22,852
All right, we gotta
get out of here now.

428
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,353
Do you think there's
more of them?

429
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,158
It's not them
I'm worried about. Come on.

430
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,905
Come on.

431
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,911
We need to get you
to the police station.

432
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,047
No, I have to go get my son.

433
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:54,016
You can call him
from the police station.

434
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,989
Look, if you ever need
anything, anything at all,

435
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,090
this is where I'm staying.

436
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,526
Thank you.

437
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:14,311
They're in the alley!

438
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,016
Go!

439
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,876
Go!

440
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,417
What's wrong with you, man.
You're slipping.

441
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,186
What, you can't check your six?

442
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:12,121
Robert.

443
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,956
Just like old times, huh?

444
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,391
Me saving your life

445
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,227
and your hooker girl
flying up into the wind.

446
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,597
How about this,
you do what you do,

447
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,933
I do what I do.

448
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,234
We'll see who comes out on top.

449
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,070
I appreciate you
killing some of the bad guys,

450
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,138
that was nice of you.

451
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:33,209
Oh, I'm gonna stop you, boy.

452
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:37,213
I wanted to ask you something.

453
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:40,149
Would you give your life
to save the world,

454
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:43,052
if nobody knew you did it?

455
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,928
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

456
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,263
And you're not telling me
when we'll settle anything.

457
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,432
I'm gonna dictate the time.

458
00:48:56,434 --> 00:49:00,569
Tomorrow, midnight,
Devil's Garden, come alone.

459
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:21,257
I want to assure all of you that
this crime wave will come to an end.

460
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:24,727
We have the best police
department in the country.

461
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,963
And we're working
around the clock

462
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:30,232
to make sure that all the good,
law-abiding citizens are safe.

463
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:35,004
Mayor Randolph has called the events
of this past week "a crime wave".

464
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,606
But perhaps it's a wave
of a different kind,

465
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,308
a wave of justice.

466
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,044
<i>Murderers, robbers, rapists,</i>

467
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:44,146
<i>dealers, pedophiles,
and the Mob.</i>

468
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,115
<i>None are safe.</i>

469
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:47,750
<i>A source of ours at the police
department</i>

470
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:51,187
<i>says that other than
the actual acts perpetuated</i>

471
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,222
<i>by the super-vigilante
this past week,</i>

472
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,624
<i>there has been virtually no
other violent crime</i>

473
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:59,695
<i>reported throughout the city. In an
online poll we took earlier today</i>

474
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:02,298
<i>shows that the super-vigilante
currently enjoys</i>

475
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,500
<i>a higher approval rating
than Mayor Randolph.</i>

476
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,202
I'm Jerry Simon.

477
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:09,271
Draw your own conclusions,
ladies and gentlemen,

478
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,539
I'll draw mine.

479
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,175
And to all you criminals
out there,

480
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:17,246
Jerry Simon says...
it's judgement day.

481
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,782
And cut.

482
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:21,017
That was great.

483
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,184
Of course it was, it's me.

484
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:28,024
Mr. Mayor! Your thoughts on
the super-vigilante, sir?

485
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:31,293
I'm sorry, Mr. Simon, I have
an important meeting to get to.

486
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,728
Just one quote.

487
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,565
Mayor Nate Randolph
for Governor.

488
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:43,339
What do you think, Neil?

489
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,408
I think he's an asshole.

490
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,210
You gonna let him be governor?

491
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,346
Well, it's not up to me.

492
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,581
It's up to the people.

493
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:10,132
Mr. Mayor, your wife's
holding on line two.

494
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,338
Tell her I'm in a meeting.

495
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,354
So, I really need some.

496
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:35,424
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Come on, I'll suck your dick.

497
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,761
I don't know, the last time you fucking
chewed it all up with those teeth.

498
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:42,164
I won't this time,
it'll be really good.

499
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,666
All right, but you owe me.

500
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:49,231
Hey.

501
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,500
Hi.

502
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,769
I didn't know where else to go.

503
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:57,306
Well, why don't you
go to the police?

504
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:59,508
Everyone would know.

505
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,710
I'm not exactly
the girl next door.

506
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:05,247
Well, the police don't care
about your job.

507
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,849
That's the difference
between them and him.

508
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:10,319
Please?

509
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,632
William, this is Corey.

510
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:27,503
Corey, this is
my friend, William.

511
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,438
Hey there, Corey, how you doing?

512
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,973
Good.

513
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,450
Uh, sorry, I wasn't
expecting company.

514
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:44,486
It's okay, we weren't
expecting to need it.

515
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:52,361
Honey, do you need
to go to the bathroom?

516
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,464
Um, do you mind if I use it?

517
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:58,267
- No, go right ahead.
- Oh, thanks.

518
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,422
Ahh.

519
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,428
Are you a good guy
or are you a bad guy?

520
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,465
Well, what did
your mom tell you?

521
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:30,966
That you're a good guy.

522
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,936
That's what my son thought, too.

523
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:37,406
How old is your son?

524
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,877
- How old are you?
- Six.

525
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:45,781
Six-years-old, hm...

526
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,817
I think that's about how old my
son was the last time I saw him.

527
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,519
Where is he?

528
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:53,455
I don't know.

529
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,471
He'll sleep
through the night now.

530
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,607
He can sleep through anything.

531
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:15,844
You know, you can stay here as
long as you want.

532
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:18,814
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

533
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:23,452
You know, you think your life
is gonna turn out one way,

534
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:26,021
and then it goes somewhere
completely different.

535
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:30,526
Right now, I just...
I just want him to be safe.

536
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,761
He'll be safe here.

537
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:35,531
And so will you.

538
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,803
The news is right. There hasn't been a
violent crime reported in almost a week.

539
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,671
And hell, if it wasn't
for Colonel Sikes,

540
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,540
wouldn't have much
of any crime reported.

541
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,376
All the other precincts saying
pretty much the same thing.

542
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:50,045
Hey, if we don't get this guy
soon, we'll all be out of a job.

543
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,780
There'll be no one else
left to arrest.

544
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,582
A drop in crime,
no matter what the reason,

545
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:54,950
it's gotta be
a good thing, right?

546
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,386
For the department,
for the city.

547
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,655
Listen, if we
play this thing right,

548
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:03,625
at the end of the day, you guys are
gonna be very popular around here,

549
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:06,061
and you might just be looking
at the next Chief of Police.

550
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:09,665
As long as we don't count the dead bodies
of the unrighteous littering the streets,

551
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,834
then yeah, we can tell ourselves
we're doing a fine job.

552
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,036
Aren't you being just a little
bit dramatic, Detective?

553
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:18,440
What, you think all the city's
criminals are on vacation, Captain?

554
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:21,443
They're shit scared of this
"super-vigilante" and so am I.

555
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,579
We don't know anything about
this Colonel Sikes.

556
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:26,448
He could just as easily start
taking out school kids tomorrow,

557
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,083
and there's not a goddamn thing
we can do about it.

558
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:31,019
Yeah, we don't even have
a picture, or a description.

559
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,055
Porter's right,
we're chasing a ghost.

560
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,023
Speaking of Agent Porter,
we heard from him?

561
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:37,826
Not a peep. But I did call
the Pentagon myself about Sikes.

562
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:41,163
- And?
- After two hours of being transferred

563
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,865
to every ranking
officer on duty,

564
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,733
they couldn't even tell me this
guy existed,

565
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,702
let alone give me his file.

566
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:49,538
And don't expect them to
anytime soon.

567
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,608
Plausible deniability.

568
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,544
- Where have you been?
- Drunk.

569
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:57,846
But I am meeting Sikes
at midnight.

570
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:00,949
That doesn't give us much time.
Where?

571
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,719
- Devil's Garden.
- That's Vincent Romano's club.

572
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,587
That makes it interesting.
You sure about that?

573
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,889
Oh, yeah, he's gonna be there.

574
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:09,458
- He's the one who set it up.
- Why?

575
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:12,428
It was the honorable
thing to do.

576
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,863
We need to shut down every
street in a three block radius.

577
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,598
I agree. Let's also
get SWAT on the move.

578
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,933
I want to nail this bastard.

579
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,768
There was a catch.

580
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,036
He wants me alone.

581
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:23,105
Oh, yeah. And I want
to lose ten pounds, pal.

582
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,442
Well, he sees any cops,
he's gonna disappear.

583
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,910
You're never
gonna find him again.

584
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:30,212
So what do you suggest?

585
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,120
All right, I'm going in.

586
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,756
I don't care if
the whole damn place explodes,

587
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:43,792
nobody moves an inch
until I give the word.

588
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,596
Asshole.

589
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,810
All right, everyone,
you heard him.

590
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:04,613
No one move until I give
the go ahead.

591
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,024
We hear you loud and clear,
Detective.

592
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:37,072
How are you, William?

593
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,875
I took the liberty
to order you a drink.

594
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,177
I thought you might want one.

595
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,213
I'm here to take you down,
Robert.

596
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:50,052
Since you've been in town, you've killed
two crack heads, a bunch of gangsters.

597
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:53,121
Man, I thought
you'd come to help me.

598
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:56,592
That was just self-defense.

599
00:59:56,594 --> 01:00:00,262
And you let the media think that
I did all the killing.

600
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,097
That was kind of clever of you.

601
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,933
Cigar?

602
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,736
I don't smoke anymore.

603
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:13,742
He who never met a girl
he did not try to fuck,

604
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,677
a drink he didn't want to drink,

605
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,145
a vice he didn't like,

606
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,181
has now given up cigars?

607
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:34,129
What in the hell happened
to you anyway, Robert?

608
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:38,700
Hey, man, I never went soft,
that's what happened to me.

609
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:40,302
I still love my country.

610
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,640
I still love my family,
even though they're gone.

611
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,842
And I'm still an honorable man.

612
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,977
Kimi and Patrick's death
doesn't justify

613
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,647
this one-man crusade
you've been going on.

614
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:54,716
Except for the cigars, their deaths
have nothing to do with any of this.

615
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:57,653
I know you went
soft a long time ago,

616
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,955
but you and I took an oath,

617
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:02,124
along with every other soldier,

618
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:06,294
to defend our country
against all enemies,

619
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,864
foreign and domestic.

620
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:13,735
So now you just, uh, kill anyone
that you decide is "evil"?

621
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,704
That's very noble.

622
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,973
There are places
in this country,

623
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,841
places in every city,

624
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,678
where people can't go
without fear of being robbed,

625
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,112
mugged, murdered.

626
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:26,848
We don't accept that
in other countries.

627
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,051
Why should we accept that here?

628
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:32,688
We also took an oath to protect
the Constitution.

629
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,022
Or have you forgotten that?

630
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,390
There's right and wrong.

631
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:38,226
The laws are meant to serve us,

632
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,961
not to serve them.

633
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:41,697
Slavery was a law,

634
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,966
and if it wasn't for men
like us standing up,

635
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:47,469
it might still be there.

636
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,914
He's here.

637
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,151
So, in your little world,

638
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,854
who chooses who's "good"
and who's "bad"?

639
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:08,423
- You?
- Judges, juries,

640
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,325
military tribunals,

641
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:13,729
but somebody has to
start somehow

642
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:16,431
trying to make a difference.
And if you've seen

643
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:19,735
what's happened to the crime
rate around here,

644
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,269
I'd say I'm doing something.

645
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,271
And who do you think
you'd be serving?

646
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:26,041
Certainly not the innocent woman
and the scared little boy

647
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,275
hiding out with me.

648
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:28,777
Are you, of all people,

649
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,378
trying to lecture me
on morality?

650
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,515
I never missed a soccer game.

651
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:36,384
I never forgot an anniversary.

652
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:40,255
I never went over the speed
limit or cheated on my taxes.

653
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,923
You, on the other hand,

654
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:45,427
you had a beautiful wife
and a son who loved you

655
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,195
more than anything in the world.

656
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,831
You drank, you lied,

657
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,301
you cheated, and you fucked
everything that moved,

658
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,771
foreign and domestic.

659
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:59,107
I served my country
proudly and honorably.

660
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:04,112
And my wife was
ripped away from my life

661
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:08,083
without any regard
for her innocence.

662
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:10,318
Yours left you
on her own free will

663
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,121
because you were
such a son of a bitch.

664
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,157
And I'm the bad guy?

665
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,993
If I'm the "bad guy",
what does that make you?

666
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:23,398
The man who's going to bring
your little crusade to an end.

667
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,068
Detective, get in here and let's
take this son of a bitch down.

668
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,405
Knowing that you're such
a trustworthy individual,

669
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,208
I brought this little
jamming device.

670
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:37,212
I'm done fucking with you.

671
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:39,981
Don't move!

672
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,950
No, you're not gonna shoot me.

673
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,854
I hope you don't think
I've gone that soft.

674
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:48,156
You're sitting on a chair that
has a bomb underneath,

675
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,059
kind of like the bomb that we used
to take out that Iraqi General,

676
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:54,529
the one that goes boom when you stand up.
Yeah, that one.

677
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:57,866
You shoot me, you die.

678
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:00,468
My life for yours, that
sounds like a pretty good deal.

679
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,070
I'll make this easy.

680
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,306
My finger goes off this
detonator,

681
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:06,875
everybody goin' die.

682
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,944
Goodbye, William.

683
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,212
Oh, shit!

684
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:47,115
Move it, move it!

685
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:48,283
Kill him!

686
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,021
All of you, get out of here!
Go on!

687
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,148
Stay down!

688
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:30,652
You've got the wrong guy!

689
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:50,138
Drop your weapon!
Don't you move!

690
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,244
Don't do it.

691
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,732
You all right, Porter?

692
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:21,703
What the hell happened in here?

693
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,705
He was here.

694
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:27,242
He put a bomb under my chair.

695
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:30,111
If I get up, it's gonna explode.

696
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:39,421
I don't see anything.

697
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:41,523
It can't be that small.

698
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:44,292
There's no bomb here, sir.

699
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:49,230
That son of a bitch.

700
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,264
There's a lot
of dead people in there!

701
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,433
I don't care whose
standards you were using,

702
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,569
not all the victims
were bad guys.

703
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:30,605
He had a jamming device.

704
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,440
No transmissions were possible.

705
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,642
Don't go anywhere.

706
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:48,389
This guy's not gonna stop until I have
an Emmy, a Peabody, and a Pulitzer.

707
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:53,328
Let's do some reporting.

708
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,430
- How could this happen?
- We had only static

709
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,298
from the moment Agent Porter
entered the club.

710
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,400
He said Sikes
used a jamming device.

711
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:01,636
It would have to be
one hell of a jammer.

712
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,438
The static I heard
sounded a lot more like

713
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,406
Agent Porter simply
turned off his wire.

714
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:07,308
Porter turning off his wire?

715
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,843
That doesn't make any sense,
Captain.

716
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:11,913
- No, no, it doesn't.
- What would you like us to do?

717
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,582
I would like you to get your asses
back to the station and book Romano.

718
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:18,453
And take Agent Porter with you. And
don't let him out of your sight

719
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,524
until I get a chance to talk to whoever the
hell his supervisor is back in Washington.

720
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:27,428
I'm gonna nail his ass
to the wall for this.

721
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,370
Hey, detectives, looks like the
super-vigilante struck again.

722
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:36,471
What's the body count this time?

723
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:37,672
Why don't you
go chase the ambulance

724
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,774
and count them yourself, okay?

725
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:43,444
I only report the news,
I don't make it.

726
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,684
Where's Agent Porter?

727
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:02,864
He's still alive.

728
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:06,234
Who? The super-vigilante?

729
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:09,904
Yeah, the "super-vigilante".

730
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,874
You know him, don't you?

731
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,811
Yeah. He's, uh...

732
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,747
Colonel Robert Sikes.

733
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:23,518
He was my commanding officer
and my best friend.

734
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,722
Took me under his wing when I was just a
scared kid looking to serve my country.

735
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:31,492
He knows what I'm capable of,
and what I'm not.

736
01:10:33,363 --> 01:10:35,830
Oh, my God, are you all right?

737
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:37,932
Uh, yeah, I am.

738
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:40,268
Look, you should be happy.

739
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,937
The police arrested
Vincent Romano tonight.

740
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,772
Oh, yeah, thank God.

741
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:47,875
I saw it on the news.
What happened?

742
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,578
Robert, uh...

743
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,748
He set me up to help him take
down Romano and the cartel.

744
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,550
That's a good thing, right?

745
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:58,686
Well, for you and Corey, it is.

746
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,028
Oh, uh, he loves baseball.

747
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,297
He never had a glove.

748
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:14,502
This was my little boy's.

749
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:18,806
You're not gonna be safe as long
as Robert's out there.

750
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:21,542
You need to go to the police.

751
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:24,312
He still wants me dead?

752
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:27,615
My hope now lies where it always
has, in stopping Robert.

753
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:31,819
And the only way to stop him,
is to become him.

754
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,570
Yes.

755
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,573
That's her.

756
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:57,679
That's my little girl.

757
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:00,648
You said, um...

758
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:05,486
this happened at Devil's Garden?

759
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,988
Yes, ma'am.

760
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,624
There was a shoot-out
and your daughter just...

761
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:11,726
happened to be there.

762
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:15,863
I'm sorry for your loss,
Senator.

763
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:22,570
Are you, Detective?

764
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:28,009
You just brought in a mob boss.

765
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:33,481
You'll probably get a promotion.

766
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,573
They're gonna be transporting
Romano downtown soon.

767
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,609
- Think we can still make it?
- How fast can you drive?

768
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:18,593
"Tonight, 10p.m.,
the Snake Eyes Club,

769
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:21,062
you don't bring the police

770
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:24,132
and I don't bring my gun."

771
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:29,737
Neil? Neil!

772
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:37,111
This is the footage
from Romano's security system.

773
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,716
That's Porter talking to Sikes.

774
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:47,555
And there's Senator Richards'
daughter.

775
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:58,099
Well, at least she wasn't
shot by one of ours.

776
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:04,572
And what's a senator's daughter
doing in a mobster's club anyway?

777
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,741
It's a hot spot.
All the kids go there.

778
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:10,211
Do you know who owns all the
places you've been to, Captain?

779
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:16,984
Captain Connely.

780
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,622
All right.

781
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,893
It's time.
Romano's ready.

782
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:28,830
I want this transport done
without incident.

783
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,232
No press, no comment,
no nothing.

784
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:34,635
Once Romano's downtown, he's
the D.A.'s problem, not ours.

785
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:37,004
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

786
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:39,674
- Yes, sir.
- Make me proud.

787
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:45,146
Well, Mr. Romano is an upstanding
citizen of this community.

788
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:49,250
All he did was try to defend himself
inside his own place of business.

789
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:52,153
He didn't kill anybody,
he didn't shoot anybody.

790
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:55,690
And I'm sure the judge and the jury will
see it that way if it even gets to trial.

791
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,825
I'm sure the judge
and jury will.

792
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,527
Thank you for your time.

793
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:02,763
- - Let's go!
Come on, Neil!

794
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,735
- Mr. Romano!
- Mr. Romano!

795
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:11,672
Mr. Romano, is there any truth
to the accusation

796
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,041
that the girl was killed by your
direction at the Devil's Garden?

797
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:17,111
- We're following behind Mr. Romano right now...
- Come on, move!

798
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:20,214
Keep on walking.
Move, please!

799
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:23,951
Thank you, move!

800
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:31,158
Watch your head.
Nice and easy.

801
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,960
- Nice and steady.
- What we're witnessing now, Mr. Romano,

802
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:35,830
the crime boss who's been
accused of everything

803
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:38,900
from prostitution
to racketeering to murder,

804
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:42,870
this may be the very last time
we see him outside...

805
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:04,685
Hey, partner?

806
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:08,990
There's someone in the captain's
office to see you.

807
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,808
Detective Peterson,

808
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,779
I'm Keri Green
and this is Corey.

809
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:34,682
We need your help.

810
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:38,986
As governor, my administration

811
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:41,789
will be for
the creation of new jobs.

812
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:47,128
Most importantly, it will
be against crime.

813
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:50,831
<i>The so-called "super-vigilante"
is a menace to all the good,</i>

814
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,000
<i>honest people of this city.</i>

815
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,036
<i>That is why
when I am elected governor,</i>

816
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:57,938
<i>I'll be able to insure
that he gets the electric chair</i>

817
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,741
<i>for all the terrible acts
he's committed.</i>

818
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:04,979
<i>Now we have one of the finest
police departments in the country,</i>

819
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:08,015
<i>but we must never be too proud
to ask for assistance.</i>

820
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:13,154
<i>This "super-vigilante"
is a plague upon our city,</i>

821
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:16,957
<i>and is nothing short
of a domestic terrorist.</i>

822
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:23,698
You shouldn't have said that.

823
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,232
<i>And that is why,
with the help of</i>

824
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,368
<i>the Honorable Senator Richards,</i>

825
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,337
<i>I have asked the FBI
to assist us</i>

826
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:34,208
<i>in stopping this terrorist
once and for all.</i>

827
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:16,150
So, you never saw Colonel Sikes
at the Snake Eyes Club?

828
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,788
No. I never got
a good look at him.

829
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,090
I never saw his face.

830
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,459
You never saw him plant a bomb
or leave a briefcase?

831
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:29,096
No, I left before any of that.

832
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:32,133
But you've been
with Agent Porter since?

833
01:19:32,135 --> 01:19:37,071
I went to my apartment first,
that's when Romano's men came.

834
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:40,541
They thought I knew
who blew up the club.

835
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:44,145
They were gonna kill me
if I didn't tell them.

836
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:47,915
So who killed the men in your
apartment and outside your building?

837
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,316
William.

838
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:51,952
Agent Porter.

839
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:55,556
He's the one who saved me
and my son.

840
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:59,226
Agent Porter killed them?

841
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:01,996
All except for
the guy with the broken arm.

842
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:04,532
He said Colonel Sikes
killed him.

843
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:10,104
Did you happen to see
Colonel Sikes do this?

844
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,074
No, I had already run away.

845
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:18,112
Agent Porter definitely
killed the other six?

846
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:22,116
It was self-defense,
they were trying to kill us.

847
01:20:22,118 --> 01:20:24,451
I don't doubt that, Keri.

848
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,487
But Agent Porter
seems to have disappeared

849
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,823
and he didn't tell us much
of anything before he left.

850
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:30,891
Jim?

851
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:32,573
We need you outside
for a moment.

852
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:37,031
Don't go anywhere.

853
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:43,571
We have some
pretty big mouse traps.

854
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,143
What's going on?

855
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:52,046
I'm Agent Donavan.
This is Agent Franks.

856
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:53,614
Sorry for the late hour,
detective,

857
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:57,084
but we're taking over
the "super-vigilante" case.

858
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:04,058
Well, the first agent you sent
did a real bang-up job.

859
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,628
We're the first agents here.

860
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:10,898
What about Porter?

861
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,366
Who's Porter?

862
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:16,203
Special Agent William Porter?

863
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,638
We don't know anybody
by that name.

864
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,074
There is no
William Porter with the Bureau.

865
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:22,409
- Nothing at Customs.
- ATF is out!

866
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:26,580
CIA says he's not one of theirs.
I want a check with DIA.

867
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,949
I'm on right now
with the Pentagon.

868
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,151
Yeah, good luck getting
anything out of them.

869
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:36,090
Homeland Security has access to lots
of different kinds of information.

870
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:39,593
Detective, what made you think
he was with the FBI anyway?

871
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,962
Well, he had a badge
just like yours.

872
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:43,564
Obviously, not like mine.

873
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:49,403
Thank you. Okay, so the Army
has a Major William Porter

874
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:52,273
and a Colonel Robert Sikes,
both inactive.

875
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:54,441
It'll be a bit,
but the files are on their way.

876
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,977
This guy knew a lot more
than he was telling you.

877
01:21:56,979 --> 01:21:59,046
We gotta find him now!

878
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:25,673
Wait here, stay sharp.

879
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:00,507
Porter!

880
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:04,111
It's Peterson, open up,
we need to talk.

881
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:56,096
And we're back
at the scene of the crime.

882
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:00,334
Safe place for a meet?

883
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:04,238
Probably is with
the super-vigilante around.

884
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:08,342
Hey, boss, you sure you know
what you're doing?

885
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:10,244
Ratings gold.

886
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,606
Hello, Jerry.

887
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:42,209
I hope, for your sake,
you came alone.

888
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:45,612
I did, it's just me
and my cameraman, Neil.

889
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,749
I actually believe that.

890
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,784
That surprises you.

891
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,387
No risk, no gain.

892
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:56,557
Man, the only thing that
surprises me is the way you lie.

893
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:59,259
I report it how I see it.

894
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:00,427
The truth is subjective.

895
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,296
Truth is absolute.

896
01:25:02,298 --> 01:25:03,597
People are subjective.

897
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,300
Well then, this is your chance

898
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:09,403
to set the record straight.

899
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:12,306
You promised me an interview,
that's why I'm here.

900
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:14,441
I know exactly why you're here.

901
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,811
It has nothing to do with
setting the record straight.

902
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,814
Don't worry, son.

903
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:23,250
I know you're just
trying to follow orders.

904
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:33,327
Who are you?

905
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,297
I'm just a man with a plan.

906
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,433
What is this plan?

907
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:42,302
Oh, it's a little regime change.

908
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:46,240
And an uneventful demise
of someone like you.

909
01:25:52,848 --> 01:25:55,315
I thought you said no weapons?

910
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,453
No, I said no guns.

911
01:25:59,455 --> 01:26:01,488
This is not a gun.

912
01:26:07,429 --> 01:26:13,333
- - Well, if you remember
anything more about this, give me a call.

913
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,369
Okay.

914
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:19,506
Clerk said that Porter checked
out earlier tonight.

915
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,608
He paid in cash.

916
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:24,678
There's a call for you,
Detective, it's Porter.

917
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,427
- Porter?
- The mayor is the next target.

918
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:43,463
What? Okay, you listen to me
very carefully,

919
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:44,865
we know you're not a Fed.

920
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,633
I'm not a lot of things,

921
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:50,537
just a man trying
to atone for my sins.

922
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,240
You know, at some point you're
gonna have to come in, right?

923
01:27:00,516 --> 01:27:02,416
I can't do that right now.

924
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:06,486
Look, one way or another,
this thing ends tonight.

925
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,458
The FBI is here.

926
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,295
Well then, you should have no
problem tracing this call.

927
01:27:15,297 --> 01:27:18,899
The<i> Jerry Simon Says</i> show
just went off the air.

928
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:24,905
Porter?

929
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:26,807
Porter!

930
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:35,482
He said Mayor Randolph's next.

931
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:41,955
Yeah, I can hold.
I've been holding...

932
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:44,791
I want units both at City Hall
and at the mayor's house!

933
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:46,560
They're already on their way.

934
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:48,629
Captain, I got that trace on
Porter's call,

935
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:51,031
it came from a pay phone
next to the Snake Eyes Club.

936
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,466
Good, I'll let Peterson know.

937
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:55,502
I'm sure the Feds
are already on it.

938
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:58,705
Mayor's not at home. His wife
says he's working late tonight.

939
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:00,340
He's not at the office, either.

940
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:01,775
No answer on his cell phone.

941
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:05,545
Then where the hell is he?

942
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:53,994
Well, nobody's gonna beat you
in the ratings tomorrow, Jerry.

943
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:10,577
Don't be gentle,
it's only evidence, guys.

944
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:12,112
I'm never gentle.

945
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:14,981
This could show
the super-vigilante in action.

946
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:17,017
Memory card is gone.

947
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,519
Yeah, he's known not
to make things easy.

948
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:26,526
This is Donavan.

949
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,695
Well, he's mayor of one of the
largest cities in the country,

950
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,697
how hard could it be
to find him?

951
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,033
Find out who he's screwing this
week and track him down instead.

952
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,402
That's a good idea.

953
01:29:35,404 --> 01:29:37,371
You clean up here, Detective.

954
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:38,939
Let's get in the air.

955
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:48,582
Yeah, well,
the Feds just left me here.

956
01:29:48,584 --> 01:29:50,617
Tell me you got some good news.

957
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:52,986
How about this,
the file's just arrived.

958
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:56,690
Really? Okay, well don't keep me
in suspense, what do you got?

959
01:29:56,692 --> 01:30:00,594
Not much, most is classified
or blocked out.

960
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:03,730
Colonel Robert Sikes, missing
in action, presumed dead,

961
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:07,033
wife deceased, son deceased,

962
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:09,669
and then it's a laundry list
of medals.

963
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:12,105
- And that's it?
<i>- That's it.</i>

964
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:15,709
Porter's however, is
a little more interesting.

965
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:17,911
<i>Major William Porter,</i>

966
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:21,748
he was discharged soon after
Sikes went missing for,

967
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:25,419
<i>get ready, disorderly conduct,
drinking on duty,</i>

968
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,622
<i>assaulting a fellow officer,
disobeying a direct order.</i>

969
01:30:28,624 --> 01:30:30,056
I'm not a lot of things.

970
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:33,593
Just a man trying
to atone for my sins.

971
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:36,129
<i>Divorced, one son,</i>

972
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:40,133
<i>no known address for either.</i>

973
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:43,437
<i>Too bad these guys
weren't switched.</i>

974
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:45,439
<i>If it was Sikes who had come to
help us catch Porter,</i>

975
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:47,941
<i>this would have been over
the first day.</i>

976
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:05,892
Smoking cigars now, hm,
and I thought he was perfect.

977
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:10,831
<i>His wife and little boy,
safe here at home,</i>

978
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:13,733
<i>killed in a drive-by shooting.</i>

979
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:16,002
That's Porter talking to Sikes.

980
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:19,940
The static I heard sounded a lot more like
Agent Porter simply turned off his wire.

981
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:23,610
<i>And why would he do that?</i>

982
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:30,650
So, you never saw Colonel Sikes
at the Snake Eyes Club?

983
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:32,953
No, I never got
a good look at him.

984
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:34,788
You never saw him plant a bomb
or leave a briefcase?

985
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:38,692
<i>No, I left before any of that.</i>

986
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:49,269
<i>Agent Porter killed them.</i>

987
01:31:57,112 --> 01:32:00,247
He's using this rooftop
as a staging ground.

988
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,222
<i>His skills at
hand-to-hand combat, weapons,</i>

989
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:13,660
<i>firearms, and explosives
is unmatched.</i>

990
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,651
Who are you?

991
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,821
I am your super-vigilante.

992
01:32:46,228 --> 01:32:48,895
We've been after the wrong guy.

993
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:51,331
What?

994
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:54,968
Porter is Sikes.

995
01:33:26,368 --> 01:33:28,735
Tell me you have something.

996
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,804
The mayor's aide, Tanya Jones,

997
01:33:30,806 --> 01:33:33,673
apparently she used
her credit card earlier tonight

998
01:33:33,675 --> 01:33:35,675
to rent a room downtown.

999
01:33:35,677 --> 01:33:36,910
The Feds are on their way.

1000
01:33:36,912 --> 01:33:38,945
Send everyone! This is it!

1001
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,880
Send everyone!

1002
01:34:13,415 --> 01:34:16,716
You never remembered
to look behind you, either.

1003
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:24,090
What took you, man?

1004
01:34:24,092 --> 01:34:27,027
I've been waiting up here
all this time.

1005
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:31,031
I was starting to get
kind of lonely, man.

1006
01:34:31,033 --> 01:34:32,832
I was waiting for you.

1007
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:36,970
Thanks to you,
I'm kind of ahead of schedule.

1008
01:34:36,972 --> 01:34:39,439
You helped me with the cartels,
I really appreciate that.

1009
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:43,209
One way or another,
we end this tonight.

1010
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:49,816
Somehow everybody's thinking
that you're me, and I'm you.

1011
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:53,186
Well, that is unfortunate.

1012
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:56,856
That was a nice touch, man.
That's some cool shit.

1013
01:34:56,858 --> 01:35:00,760
You never answered my question.

1014
01:35:00,762 --> 01:35:02,062
I'll ask you again.

1015
01:35:02,064 --> 01:35:05,031
If you thought you
could save the world,

1016
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:09,769
but nobody would know it and you might
have to give your life in doing it,

1017
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:11,304
would you do it?

1018
01:35:11,306 --> 01:35:12,872
My life?

1019
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,775
Yeah, sure.

1020
01:35:15,777 --> 01:35:19,379
Everyone else's, no.

1021
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:24,184
Well, I'm done.

1022
01:35:24,186 --> 01:35:26,953
Come on, my man.

1023
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:45,565
Major William Porter, this is the FBI,
stay where you are, or we'll open fire.

1024
01:36:49,838 --> 01:36:50,970
Take him.

1025
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:11,524
Okay, listen up, let's get these
people out of here.

1026
01:37:11,526 --> 01:37:13,593
It's gonna get ugly, go, go!

1027
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:07,240
Your family hates you,

1028
01:39:07,242 --> 01:39:09,142
your country's done with you,

1029
01:39:09,144 --> 01:39:11,577
the police are looking for you,

1030
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:14,047
but I'm gonna have
to kill you first.

1031
01:39:15,383 --> 01:39:17,183
Come and get it.

1032
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:05,491
Dog tags found on the body said
his name was Robert Sikes.

1033
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:10,229
Detective Peterson was right,
there was no William Porter.

1034
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,532
I'll let the military figure
that one out.

1035
01:41:12,534 --> 01:41:14,534
I don't care if his name
was Porter or Sikes,

1036
01:41:14,536 --> 01:41:18,838
all I know is the super-vigilante
is dead, case closed.

1037
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,807
Sounds good to me.

1038
01:41:28,783 --> 01:41:31,484
- Is that him?
- Let's get him out of here.

1039
01:41:34,689 --> 01:41:36,289
What's left of him.

1040
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:38,558
Did you find anyone else?

1041
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,127
I don't think there
ever was anyone else.

1042
01:41:41,129 --> 01:41:42,628
The man you know
as William Porter

1043
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:46,466
is our super-vigilante
and that's him.

1044
01:41:46,468 --> 01:41:47,834
I'm sorry.

1045
01:41:50,338 --> 01:41:52,538
Thank you, Detective.

1046
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,874
I wouldn't lose too much sleep
over this guy.

1047
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:58,311
He was a killer...
not a savior.

1048
01:41:59,481 --> 01:42:02,882
William Porter saved me
and my son.

1049
01:42:02,884 --> 01:42:06,786
You don't believe me, do you?

1050
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:08,788
About what?

1051
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,390
That Porter and Sikes
were the same person.

1052
01:42:11,392 --> 01:42:15,328
You still think there were two of them,
even though we only found the one body.

1053
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:22,201
I believe you got the bad guy.
What more do you want?

1054
01:42:28,576 --> 01:42:30,309
Hey.

1055
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:32,545
- Take care of him.
- I will.

1056
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:36,916
Where did you get that?

1057
01:42:36,918 --> 01:42:39,318
Your friend just gave it to me.

1058
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,786
Can I keep it?

1059
01:42:40,788 --> 01:42:43,422
He said I had to ask you.

1060
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:56,435
Yes, you can keep it.

1061
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:06,679
Come on, let's go.

1062
01:43:08,216 --> 01:43:09,682
Let's go.
