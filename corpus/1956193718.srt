2
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,645
Why're we stopping?

3
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,770
It's the car.

4
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:11,863
You know, these old cars,
they're always overheating, so.

5
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:16,048
Okay, so now what?

6
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,848
We just gotta wait a couple minutes.

7
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,058
I don't wanna be late for the party.

8
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,433
Just a couple minutes.

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,988
I got an idea of what we could do

10
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,418
while we're waiting.

11
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,644
Oh yeah, what's that?

12
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,478
Butt stuff.

13
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,498
What?

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,518
Kissing, I thought we could just kiss.

15
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,458
Classic

16
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,703
American

17
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:41,536
kissing.

18
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,628
I should call my sister and
tell her I'm gonna be late.

19
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,668
Sure.

20
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,503
Yeah, do that.

21
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,543
Family first.

22
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,983
Then teamwork.

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,673
Hey.

24
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,333
No, we're on our way.

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,393
No.

26
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,896
Jay's car overheated,

27
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:18,398
so we're just waiting for it to cool down.

28
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:26,169
No, I'm fine.

29
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,838
I am fine, trust me.

30
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,132
No, he's not.

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,554
Mandy.

32
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,738
Trust me.

33
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,608
Okay, I'll see.

34
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,768
Mandy, please don't tell Mom

35
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,637
because, you know,

36
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,753
the way she gets.

37
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,410
Everything okay?

38
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,534
Yeah.

39
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,714
How's the car?

40
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:59,016
Probably just got
another couple of minutes.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,858
Hey,

42
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,218
I stole some Halloween candy

43
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,248
from some kids in my neighborhood.

44
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,100
You want a piece?

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,079
Yeah, actually, I do.

46
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,553
Ah.

47
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:11,386
What?

48
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:12,221
What do you say?

49
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,987
Trick-or-treat?

50
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,989
There you go, go for it.

51
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,631
I can't feel anything.

52
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,564
You got it, just pull on it!

53
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,701
Pull on it!

54
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:28,838
- Please.
- I'm trying, it's stuck.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,838
Just keep pulling on it.

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,788
Keep grabbing.

57
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,669
It's like a Toostie Roll.

58
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:35,393
It's a full-size candy bar.

59
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:39,962
What?

60
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,131
What happened?

61
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:44,398
What?

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,055
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

63
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,810
Where you going?

64
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,368
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

65
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,420
You don't have to go, it was just a joke.

66
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,078
You're fucking disgusting.

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,983
It was a joke!

68
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,948
What're you doing?

69
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,333
Jay, just fuck off.

70
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:14,718
You're just gonna walk home?

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,183
I'll find a ride, just go.

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,472
Sara, it was just a joke.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,583
I'll find a ride, just go, just go.

74
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:28,083
You know, it's going to be
hard for you to find a ride

75
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,668
when you don't have this.

76
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,218
Give me that.

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,646
Give me that.

78
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,548
You want this?

79
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,548
Give me the phone.

80
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,698
- Give me the phone.
- Ooooooh.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,511
Have fun walking, bitch.

82
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:39,177
Jay!

83
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,642
Jay!

84
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:46,899
Asshole.

85
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:56,928
Fuck!

86
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:13,516
Oh, shit!

87
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,543
Hello?

88
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,523
I just need to use your phone.

89
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,790
Can somebody help me, I just need,

90
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,605
I just need to use the phone.

91
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:16,095
Hello?

92
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:20,008
Hello?

93
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,311
Is anyone in here?

94
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:31,744
Hello?

95
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:34,439
Hello?

96
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:46,419
Hello?

97
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,470
Sara.

98
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:32,494
Jay?

99
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:35,682
Jay!

100
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,955
Trick 'r treat.

101
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:47,738
It's another
beautiful October day

102
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,571
here in Yost Town.

103
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:49,998
Halloween's right around
the corner, folks.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,718
I'll be in Inebriate
City for the two for ones

105
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,358
and don't forget, the girls
with the sluttiest costumes

106
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,948
get in free and drink till they pass out.

107
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,138
I'm your man, DJ Dick,
"from 105.6 The Mix,"

108
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,840
putting hits all up in your mouth.

109
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,255
Have you ever killed anything?

110
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:40,258
What?

111
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,068
Like, when you were younger.

112
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,988
Every kill a bird, cat or anything?

113
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,048
I killed a pet fish
by overfeeding it once.

114
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,289
Have you ever just wanted
to just kill someone?

115
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,638
I don't know, maybe.

116
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,588
Hey, what's up with
you and Ricky anyway?

117
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,618
Did you fuck him yet?

118
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,288
Jesus, Mandy.

119
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,121
What?

120
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,268
Don't tell me you haven't fucked him yet.

121
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,668
Maybe.

122
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,528
Whatever, Melissa.

123
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,148
At least given a handy?

124
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,200
You're such a slut.

125
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,188
Oh wait, look.

126
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,378
There she is.

127
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,418
Who?

128
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,670
Old Aunt Ethel.

129
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,388
Why do they call her "Old Aunt Ethel?"

130
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,728
Because, like 20 years ago,

131
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,178
she killed her entire family in that house

132
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,395
and all the neighbors could
hear someone inside yelling,

133
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,745
"Stop, Aunt Ethel!

134
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:25,433
"Please, God, stop, Aunt Ethel!"

135
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,123
Hey!

136
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,336
Jesus, Mark.

137
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,181
You scared the shit out of me.

138
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,488
What're you scared of?

139
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,091
I haven't even pulled it out yet.

140
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:35,926
Ew.

141
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,207
Gross.

142
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:40,856
Guys!

143
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,968
I love this girl.

144
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:46,825
Oh.

145
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,018
Just telling Melissa, here,
the story of Old Aunt Ethel.

146
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,228
Oh yeah, it's almost Halloween, huh?

147
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,637
What does that mean?

148
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,893
So Old Aint Ethel,

149
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,208
every year on Halloween,
she lures the kids inside.

150
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,868
Says she has very special candy,

151
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,278
candy that's gonna make
all their wishes come true.

152
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,528
And when she gets them inside,

153
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,168
she slaughters them,

154
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,695
sawing off their limbs, one by one.

155
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:13,528
Yeah right.

156
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,361
No, it's true.

157
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:15,913
Then why isn't she in jail yet?

158
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,468
Because if you don't have a body,

159
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,578
you don't have a crime.

160
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,648
What does that mean?

161
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,848
They say that Old Aunt Ethel,

162
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,418
she turns all the kids' body
parts in Halloween treats,

163
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,800
leaving behind no remains at all.

164
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:42,398
That's one psychotic bitch.

165
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,798
You definitely don't wanna

166
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,500
go trick-or-treating at her place.

167
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,051
She'll turn you into pumpkin pie.

168
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:33,823
11, 12

169
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:35,720
13, 14,

170
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:36,921
15, 16, 17,

171
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:38,285
18, 19,

172
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,120
20.

173
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,000
11 more to go.

174
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:54,328
Hello.

175
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,370
Hey, girl, what you doin'?

176
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,323
You know, just "twerking
the fleek," right?

177
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,713
What?

178
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:05,467
I don't know.

179
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,693
You going to Mandy's party tonight?

180
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,361
I don't know yet.

181
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:13,540
I still have a lot of
studying and stuff to do.

182
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,238
Bitch, you better.

183
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,952
You on the rag or something?

184
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,025
What? No!

185
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:19,878
Mmmmm.

186
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,078
You got that heavy flow.

187
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,263
Girl, just double up.

188
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,589
Double up?

189
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,618
Yeah, girl, just stick
two super heavy flows

190
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,608
right up in that bitch

191
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,738
and you could party for
four hours straight.

192
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,891
No leakage.

193
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:34,726
Ha.

194
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,828
What, no, I'm not on my period.

195
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,258
I just don't know if I'm gonna go yet.

196
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,518
Girl, you gotta live a little.

197
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,508
This is not Ohio or
wherever the fuck you from.

198
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,629
We party hard out here, okay, hoe?

199
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,161
Okay.

200
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:53,087
Hey, do you know about all
that "Old Aunt Ethel" stuff?

201
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,978
Yeah, girl, everybody has
heard about Old Aunt Ethel.

202
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,488
I mean, is it true that
she takes all the kids

203
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,628
on Halloween night and stuff?

204
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,208
Bitch, you worry about
the wrong things, okay?

205
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,808
Get your shit together,
we partying hard tonight.

206
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,850
Okay, hoe.

207
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,094
Ah.

208
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,318
Let's see.

209
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,837
What do I need?

210
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,397
Bop!

211
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,232
Ah!

212
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,098
Ah, yes,

213
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,017
I need you.

214
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,513
Yeah!

215
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,916
Ah, I love that.

216
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:42,842
Woo.

217
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,109
Yee-haw!

218
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:10,944
Yee-haw!

219
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,154
Look at that.

220
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,458
Oh, I'm getting excited!

221
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,824
I'm getting excited!

222
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,401
Ricky!

223
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:27,756
Get the fuck out of here!

224
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:28,591
Oh!

225
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:31,439
Sorry.

226
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:32,274
And now!

227
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,029
Time for my famous pickled chocolates.

228
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,786
Mmmm, it already smells good.

229
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,803
Oh, the heel.

230
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,608
The heel and the balls.

231
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,852
The balls of the feet are the best.

232
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,238
Mmmm-mmmm, I can almost taste 'em.

233
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,783
I can almost taste 'em.

234
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:28,863
I love it.

235
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,143
Everybody loves them.

236
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,247
I'll eat 'em, that's for damn sure.

237
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:43,995
Yes, sir.

238
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:58,580
Perfect.

239
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,415
Perfect.

240
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:05,869
All right, now, let's
get these in the oven.

241
00:20:11,784 --> 00:20:12,617
Ah, yes.

242
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,031
Of course.

243
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,573
With this soul, another day will come.

244
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:28,429
100!

245
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,335
Yeah, bitches!

246
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,285
Aren't you with Melissa?

247
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:32,118
What?

248
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,573
No, I ditched that bitch.

249
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,024
No fucking way.

250
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:41,015
Hey, what's up, bitch?

251
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:42,403
Are you seeing this?

252
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,918
Ew, what a dick.

253
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,070
Just come on, fuck him.

254
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,033
Melissa, wait!

255
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:56,721
I just can't believe
he would do this to me.

256
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,470
Fuck him, Melissa.

257
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:00,088
Who cares?

258
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,738
I care!

259
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,458
Well, what did you expect?

260
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,418
What does that mean?

261
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,198
You haven't even given him a handy.

262
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,388
Great, thanks.

263
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,802
Nice pep talk.

264
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,308
Melissa, can we please talk?

265
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,238
She doesn't want to talk to you, Ricky.

266
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,998
Melissa, please, just
give me a chance to explain.

267
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,838
Come on.

268
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,298
There's nothing to explain.

269
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,638
I can handle this.

270
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,508
Fine, go ahead, I was
just trying to help.

271
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,628
I really don't care about
what you have to say, Ricky.

272
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,818
It's all bullshit anyways.

273
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,228
Just leave me alone.

274
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,613
Yeah, fuck off, Ricky.

275
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,768
Leave me alone, Ricky.

276
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,920
It's me, Mark.

277
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,298
Well, is Ricky there with you?

278
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,560
No, he left, like, a long time ago.

279
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:41,148
Are you kidding me?

280
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,038
Whatever, fuck him.

281
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,998
Let's party.

282
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,068
Dr. Dick in the house.

283
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,608
I think I wanna go home.

284
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,218
Come on, Mel.

285
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,588
I'm really not in the mood to party.

286
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,958
Come on, don't let him get in the way

287
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,338
of you living your life, Melissa.

288
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,248
It's not just him.

289
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,500
I was up late last night
studying, I'm tired.

290
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,748
I'm just gonna go.

291
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,148
I'll walk with you.

292
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,548
Fuck, seriously?

293
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,898
You don't have to do
that, Mandy, I'm fine.

294
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,731
She's fine, babe.

295
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,564
Mark, shut up.

296
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,397
This is girl code.

297
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,579
You don't fucking get it.

298
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,443
You're right, I don't fucking get it.

299
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:10,838
And don't make me pull
a "Ricky" on you too.

300
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,147
Really, Mark?

301
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:13,488
Too soon?

302
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,359
Fuck you.

303
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,528
Eh.

304
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,378
I'll tell you what, Mark.

305
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,798
You go ahead and pull a "Ricky" on me

306
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,068
but you better make it worth your while

307
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,308
because it'll be the last time
you stick that little pee-pee

308
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,488
in a vagina ever again, got it?

309
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,676
Got it.

310
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,188
Now you're gonna get it.

311
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:28,338
Seriously?

312
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,173
Jesus.

313
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,678
You need to get over
him, ASAP, seriously.

314
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,078
I wasn't gonna say anything
but I fucked him last year

315
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,178
and he was, like, the
quickest cummer ever.

316
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,011
It was pitiful.

317
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,658
Mandy, are you serious?

318
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,678
What? It was last year
before you guys even met.

319
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,818
And you weren't gonna tell me?

320
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,348
I did just tell you.

321
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,846
Jesus, Mandy.

322
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,679
Whatevs.

323
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,878
My point is you need to get over him.

324
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,268
He's a waste of time.

325
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,558
Seems like everything's
a waste of time nowadays.

326
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,548
Oh, look.

327
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,868
There's Aunt Ethel.

328
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,088
Come on, let's go look.

329
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,388
No.

330
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,221
Come on.

331
00:24:58,223 --> 00:24:59,056
Seriously?

332
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,973
Well, wait up.

333
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,388
She looks like a regular old
lady baking a cake to me.

334
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,348
It may seem that way
but I assure you it's not.

335
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,488
She's probably boiling
someone's skull right now.

336
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,198
Oh, come on.

337
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,150
Yes, sir.

338
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,468
This is ridiculous.

339
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,808
Why are we creeping
around some poor old lady?

340
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,855
Poor old lady?

341
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,774
Yeah right.

342
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,376
I'm going home.

343
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:29,628
This is stupid.

344
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:35,209
Mmmm-mmmm.

345
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:40,577
Yes, sir.

346
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,174
Mmmmmm.

347
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,285
Oh,

348
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,537
it's delicious.

349
00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:59,052
Mmmmm.

350
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,453
Put that back in there.

351
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:02,288
Yes, sir.

352
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:57,575
Shit.

353
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,423
Hey!

354
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,098
What're you doing there?

355
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,200
You trick-or-treating?

356
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,988
Trick-or-treat.

357
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,758
Well, Halloween ain't for a couple days.

358
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,893
You're early.

359
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,998
I'm really bad about time, I'm so sorry.

360
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,528
- No.
- I'll just be going now.

361
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,598
You're in luck because
I never turn away company.

362
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,600
And I make the best pickled
Halloween treats in town.

363
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,058
They're chocolate and they're delicious.

364
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,891
Come on in.

365
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:37,398
I really should be going.

366
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,088
Oh, no, no, no, not yet.

367
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,988
Not yet, dear.

368
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,818
I've got some delicious treats inside.

369
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,918
Come on in.

370
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,213
- Come on, come on in.
- I should be going.

371
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:49,046
Come on.

372
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:51,518
I really don't wanna ruin
my appetite, like you said.

373
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,228
Halloween's a couple days away, right?

374
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,880
You gonna come
back to see me on Halloween?

375
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,781
Yeah.

376
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:01,028
You better, young lady.

377
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,748
Cause everyone loves

378
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,678
Aunt Ethel's

379
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,843
pickled chocolates.

380
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,005
They're homemade.

381
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:42,377
Mom, is that you?

382
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:46,278
Jesus, Ricky, what're you doing here?!

383
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,258
What?!

384
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,918
The front door was open.

385
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,558
I called for you but you didn't answer.

386
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,278
How long have you been here?

387
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,418
I just walked in.

388
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,548
Don't worry, I didn't see anything.

389
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,808
Get out!

390
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,718
I just wanna talk.

391
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,551
Leave!

392
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:00,838
Before I call the cops!

393
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,208
Are you serious?

394
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,343
Get out!

395
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,213
Okay.

396
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,923
Okay.

397
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,926
You know, you're making
a big fucking mistake.

398
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:18,306
Jeez.

399
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:06,002
Okay, just wait here.

400
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:06,921
Don't move.

401
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:08,734
Don't move.

402
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,845
Shit!

403
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,188
I'll be right back.

404
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,903
No cheating.

405
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,883
Just wait right there.

406
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,651
Hello.

407
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:56,093
Hi, this is Mortimer J. Jackson.

408
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:56,926
Who?

409
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,417
Mortimer J. Jackson.

410
00:31:58,419 --> 00:31:59,250
I'm with...

411
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:00,243
Who now?

412
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:01,980
Mortimer J. Jackson.

413
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:02,849
What?

414
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,268
- I'm with...
- What? What?

415
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,965
I'm with
Vacation Surplus, ma'am.

416
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,114
What do you want?

417
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:08,570
Ma'am, I
was just calling today

418
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,388
to ask you if you were curious about

419
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,516
ever wanting to take a vacation.

420
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:13,589
Ma'am, have you thought about...

421
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:14,422
No!

422
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:15,255
Ma'am, have you thought...

423
00:32:15,257 --> 00:32:16,088
No!

424
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,868
I don't have any, I don't want any either.

425
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,750
Hello, ma'am?

426
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:24,800
Hey, what's up, bitch?

427
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,998
Hey, what're you up to?

428
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,258
Nothing.

429
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,538
You'll never guess what Ricky just did.

430
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,828
Did you catch him jacking
off outside your window?

431
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,878
What? No.

432
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,818
Why?

433
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,698
I never told you that?

434
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,938
Told me what?

435
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,018
He jacks off outside
my window sometimes.

436
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,598
But he does it to like everybody.

437
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,098
Jesus, Mandy, why did you
set me up with this creep?

438
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,598
I didn't want to be
the only one with crabs.

439
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,457
What?!

440
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:52,108
What?

441
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,110
Nothing, you're fine, just keep going.

442
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,508
What are you doing?

443
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,238
Nothing, wanna come over?

444
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,128
Yeah.

445
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,961
Oh, remind me,

446
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,516
I have something to tell
you when I get there.

447
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,693
You cheated.

448
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,793
You cheated!

449
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,133
I had six!

450
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,043
I know damn well I had six!

451
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,391
You cheater!

452
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,570
Well I'll be damned.

453
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:52,753
I do have six.

454
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:09,458
Hey, Mrs.
Cooper, is Mandy home?

455
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,293
Hey.

456
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,448
Sara, right?

457
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,208
Melissa, actually.

458
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,418
Oh, right, Melissa.

459
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,483
I guess you just have one
of those forgettable faces.

460
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,263
Oh, okay.

461
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,673
Is Mandy home?

462
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,341
Yeah.

463
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:30,623
The bitch is in her room.

464
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,988
So, where you guys going tonight?

465
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,648
Oh, I'm not sure.

466
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,968
Well, I can hang out
with you guys tonight

467
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,768
if you wanted me to.

468
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,668
You know what the new in thing
is these days, don't you?

469
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,064
What's that?

470
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,418
MILFs.

471
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,608
These young guys, they love us MILFs.

472
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,568
Mom's I'd Like to...

473
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,478
No, I got it, I got it.

474
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,625
I know what a MILF is.

475
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,668
And I could even hook you guys up.

476
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,528
Like when a guy hits on
me and I don't like him,

477
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,043
then I could let you have him.

478
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,388
Gee, thanks.

479
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,063
Okay, well just let me know.

480
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,113
Right.

481
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,040
Come in.

482
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,418
Jesus, you guys.

483
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,138
It's all good, just come in.

484
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,983
No, I'll wait.

485
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,932
Babe.

486
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,658
I was just about to cum.

487
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,560
Well now you're just about to leave.

488
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,722
So it's like that?

489
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:34,555
It's like that.

490
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:36,148
Look, guys, I can go.

491
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,981
No.

492
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:37,888
He's leaving.

493
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,708
This is bullshit, Mandy.

494
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,208
No, this is girl code, bitch.

495
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,758
Raised on the streets, son.

496
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,268
Don't get clapped up.

497
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,788
You know what, fuck you.

498
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,838
What was that?

499
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,988
I said, fuck you.

500
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,823
Prove it.

501
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,533
Just get out.

502
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,113
You are one crazy bitch.

503
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,278
So, what did you have to tell me?

504
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,824
Oh, right.

505
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:05,768
Okay, so last night I couldn't sleep,

506
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,948
so I ended up going on this walk.

507
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,628
It was like 2AM or something

508
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,781
and I ended up going past
Old Aunt Ethel's house

509
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:15,765
and I went up and looked in
her window and she caught me.

510
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:16,598
See saw you?

511
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,617
Yeah, she asked if I was

512
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,533
like trick-or-treating or something.

513
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:20,366
Are you kidding me?

514
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:21,848
Uh uh, and then she asked if I wanted

515
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,308
any of her pickled chocolates.

516
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,858
You didn't eat any, did you?

517
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,808
No.

518
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,641
Why?

519
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,598
Because those are
chocolate-covered body parts.

520
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,788
Oh, yeah right.

521
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,478
I'm serious, everyone knows
about her picked chocolates.

522
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,928
What are you looking for?

523
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,998
My fucking weed.

524
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,898
I bet my mom took it again.

525
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,068
Mom, did you take my fucking weed again?!

526
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,901
Fucking bitch!

527
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,368
For the last time, Mandy,

528
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,988
I did not take your weed!

529
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,678
Yes you did, you stole my fucking weed!

530
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,613
Fucking bitch!

531
00:36:49,696 --> 00:36:51,196
I hate that bitch!

532
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,538
Hello.

533
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,748
Hi.

534
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,028
Hi.

535
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,188
What are you doing?

536
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,768
I just got to Joe's house.

537
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,778
Will you come back here first?

538
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,598
You just told me to leave, Mandy.

539
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,778
I know but I need you back.

540
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,797
Yeah, what do you want?

541
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:13,068
What makes you think I want something?

542
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,148
You don't want anything?

543
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,618
Okay, yes.

544
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,920
See, I fucking told you.

545
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:21,228
Will you go to Breed's and
get some weed for me, please?

546
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,068
Come on, Mandy, you know I
don't like going over there.

547
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,293
He's fucking crazy.

548
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:41,028
Were you followed?

549
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,048
No, man.

550
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,881
Did you circle the block

551
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:44,798
to make sure them boys didn't follow you?

552
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,700
Yeah, yeah dude.

553
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,233
Come on, motherfucker.

554
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,947
All right, motherfucker,
you know the drill.

555
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:57,782
Hands up.

556
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,848
You got anything on you?

557
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,048
No, no, I jut want some weed, man.

558
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,780
What'd you say, motherfucker?

559
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,716
I just wondered...

560
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:10,714
I know what you said but
why you saying it like that?

561
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:11,547
You got a wire?

562
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:12,768
No, I'm so sorry, dude!

563
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,678
Is this thing real?

564
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,308
Please don't kill me, please!

565
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,189
I haven't had sex without a condom yet!

566
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:20,633
And see if he has any
more of that White Tahoe.

567
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,987
Fine.

576

I'm sorry about earlier.

581
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,300
What's your name anyway?

582
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,368
Katie.

583
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,158
That's it.

584
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,508
Katie.

585
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,343
No!

586
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,263
Rachel.

587
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,418
Yeah.

588
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,828
You look like a Rachel,
that's who you are.

589
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,703
Rachel.

590
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:00,358
Hey, did you guys hear about Rachel?

591
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,203
No, what?

592
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,410
She went missing.

593
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,818
No way.

594
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,566
Yeah, she's been missing
for like three days.

595
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:10,177
What happened to her?

596
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,228
She went missing.

597
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,171
No, like,

598
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:18,623
like what do you think happened to her?

599
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,868
This stupid bitch.

600
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,998
I bet Aunt Ethel got her.

601
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,251
Why?

602
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,803
It's like, throughout
the whole month of October,

603
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,388
people disappear.

604
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,013
And sometimes you can
smell the bodies burning.

605
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,268
What do you mean?

606
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,008
So they say Aunt Ethel,

607
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,818
the body parts that she doesn't
turn into Halloween treats,

608
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,373
she burns in a big pile behind her barn.

609
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,498
You're totally fucking with me.

610
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,863
No, it's true.

611
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:51,338
Did you tell her our plan yet?

612
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,698
No, okay, so listen.

613
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,378
Tomorrow night is Halloween, right?

614
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,568
So we're gonna have a stakeout
at Aunt Ethel's house.

615
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,120
Why would you want to
cook steak at Aunt Ethel's?

616
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,168
No, a stakeout isn't when
you cook steak with someone,

617
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,408
you fucking idiot!

618
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,088
It's when you watch somebody,
like some investigative shit.

619
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,988
Why would you wanna do that?

620
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,153
We are doing that.

621
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,388
Why would I wanna do that?

622
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,768
Because, don't you wanna see

623
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,628
what she really does with those kids?

624
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,628
I'm sure she doesn't
do anything with them.

625
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,448
Yeah she does.

626
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,758
I heard that she scoops your
eyeballs out of your skull

627
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,537
with a spoon and then she eats them.

628
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:31,904
Oh, whatever.

629
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,093
Well,

630
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:41,963
Rach,

631
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:47,678
I think it's time we head out to the barn.

632
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,490
You just about warn out your welcome.

633
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:10,637
Now hold still, it won't hurt a bit.

634
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:14,637
Come on, oh!

635
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,565
Shit!

636
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,472
Damn!

637
00:42:17,474 --> 00:42:18,724
Son of a bitch!

638
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:22,343
Come on, you slippery socket!

639
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,147
Gosh!

640
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:26,463
Piss!

641
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:27,382
Damn!

642
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:28,711
Bloody whore.

643
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:31,539
Oh, damn it.

644
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:33,824
Shit.

645
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:41,326
Ah.

646
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:45,591
Woo, baby.

647
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,377
What a beauty.

648
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:54,150
Oh, I can't wait to have you pickled.

649
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:03,913
Mmmmm, you're already good.

650
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,458
You're being ridiculous.

651
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,598
So come with us and let's find out.

652
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,978
Unless you're too scared.

653
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,883
I'm not scared of a little old lady.

654
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,845
You should be.

655
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,511
Jesus!

656
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,344
It's just my mom.

657
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:18,498
What are you doing in here?

658
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,228
Are you smoking weed in here, Mandy?

659
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,078
No, Mom, get out!

660
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,378
Oh, come on, let me get a little hit.

661
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,448
Get the fuck out of my room, Mom!

662
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,283
Whatever.

663
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:28,794
Oh,

664
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:30,585
hi Mark.

665
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:32,118
Hi, Miss Cooper.

666
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,613
Have you been working out?

667
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:36,482
A little bit.

668
00:43:36,484 --> 00:43:37,368
Mmmmmm.

669
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,158
I can tell.

670
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,398
Gross, Mom, that's so weird.

671
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,278
Get out of here!

672
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,248
Don't be jealous, Mandy,
it's not attractive.

673
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,728
Trust me, I'm not jealous.

674
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,038
You're just gross.

675
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,448
You are jealous because I'm a MILF.

676
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,908
You're so not a MILF, Mom.

677
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,573
I am a MILF, Mandy!

678
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:55,958
I wish I never had you!

679
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,518
God, what a bitch.

680
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,758
I don't know, I
think she's pretty cool.

681
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,016
Oh, fuck you, Mark.

682
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:06,298
Hey!

683
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,695
What're you doing, you
dirty little pervert!

684
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:12,670
Oh, shit!

685
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:14,255
Run, rabbit, run!

686
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,196
Gotcha, little rabbit.

687
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:43,418
So,

688
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,673
here you are.

689
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:47,763
Where do I start?

690
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:50,514
Ah, yes.

691
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,040
You won't be needing this anymore.

692
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:44,536
Seven more.

693
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:15,288
That girl just pushed
me, can I choke her out?

694
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,748
What? No.

695
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,418
Just got tell her it wasn't very nice

696
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,953
and I won't play with her anymore.

697
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,681
Hello.

698
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:29,968
Hello, Melissa,
this is Ricky's mom.

699
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,888
Oh, hi.

700
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,528
Have you seen Ricky lately?

701
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,348
No, I haven't seen him in a couple days.

702
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,008
Well, he didn't
come home last night

703
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,558
and we're getting worried.

704
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,838
I'm sure he'll show up.

705
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,500
Please let
me know if you see him.

706
00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:41,335
I will.

707
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,461
Hello?

708
00:47:49,463 --> 00:47:50,568
Happy Halloween, bitch.

709
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,168
You ready for our stakeout tonight?

710
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,318
Hey, so Ricky's mom just called me

711
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,748
and she hasn't seen him for a couple days.

712
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,581
Have you?

713
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,028
No, matter of fact,

714
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,658
he didn't even jack-off
outside my window last night.

715
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,493
What?

716
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,431
Hold on, Gio.

717
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:04,468
I'm sure he's fine.

718
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,308
Well, if you see him, let him
know that his mom's worried.

719
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,958
Hey, so what're you doing today?

720
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,998
You wanna go shopping?

721
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,158
I can't, I'm at the park right now

722
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,610
babysitting my little nephew.

723
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,838
Hold on, Gio!

724
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,848
Okay, well call me
when you get home then.

725
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,113
Okay, I will, bye.

726
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,528
Jesus, Gio!

727
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,648
When I'm on the phone,
don't bother me like that.

728
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,718
What's up?

729
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,188
I chocked her out.

730
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,423
Oh, shit, come on.

731
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,333
Six more.

732
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:38,078
Six more, six more.

733
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:42,101
All right.

734
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:44,669
I think I got everything we need.

735
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,495
We got handcuffs,

736
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:47,618
rope,

737
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,575
zip ties.

738
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:49,720
We got the gun

739
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,453
and an apple.

740
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:57,169
What's the apple for?

741
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,288
I don't know, it was already there.

742
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,740
Oh, right, that's my apple.

743
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,211
Who is it?

744
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:09,528
Melissa.

745
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,001
Oh shit, put this stuff away, quick.

746
00:49:11,003 --> 00:49:12,124
What, you didn't tell her?

747
00:49:12,126 --> 00:49:13,619
No, now shut up and put it away.

748
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:14,454
What?

749
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,723
- Hey.
- Hi.

750
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,313
What's up?

751
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,478
What's up with you guys?

752
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,313
Nothing.

753
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,133
Yeah, nothing.

754
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,553
You guys are weird.

755
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,808
Now what?

756
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,141
We wait.

757
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:56,974
Wait for what?

758
00:49:56,976 --> 00:49:59,508
We wait for her to take
a couple of kids inside

759
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,288
and then we see what she
really does with them.

760
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,178
And what if she doesn't?

761
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,013
Oh, she will.

762
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:06,963
She will.

763
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,448
Mandy, you've been really quiet.

764
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,283
You okay?

765
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,703
Yeah, I'm fine.

766
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,458
Okay, this is boring.

767
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,638
Could we play some music or something?

768
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,488
No!

769
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,323
Fuck!

770
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,668
There aren't even any
trick-or-treaters out.

771
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,698
That's because most people know

772
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,308
about Old Aunt Ethel, okay?

773
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,398
Kids don't come around
this block very often

774
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,930
but there's always that one.

775
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,243
And there he is.

776
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:56,301
Trick 'r treat.

777
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,664
Well, hello there.

778
00:51:01,693 --> 00:51:03,276
Okay, here we go.

779
00:51:09,138 --> 00:51:09,969
See?

780
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:10,802
I told you!

781
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:11,637
I fucking told you!

782
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,084
He could come back out.

783
00:51:14,086 --> 00:51:16,919
Oh no, they never come back out.

784
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,134
He's been in there
for like 10 minutes now.

785
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:33,828
Look.

786
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:34,730
Look, another kid.

787
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:45,048
Trick or treat.

788
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,323
Well look at you.

789
00:51:49,595 --> 00:51:51,678
Don't you look delicious.

790
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:55,118
I mean, scary.

791
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,924
Are you a little witch?

792
00:51:56,926 --> 00:51:57,843
Yeah.

793
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:00,928
I just love witches.

794
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,233
Do you know any magic spells?

795
00:52:03,235 --> 00:52:04,267
No.

796
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:05,938
Well guess what,

797
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,954
I know a real magic spell.

798
00:52:08,956 --> 00:52:10,615
Do you wanna see it?

799
00:52:10,617 --> 00:52:11,448
Yeah.

800
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,012
Come inside and I'll show you.

801
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,718
And there's another
one that's not going home

802
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,070
to Mommy and Daddy tonight.

803
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:26,668
Okay.

804
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,578
Let's do this.

805
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,468
Do what?

806
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,558
Listen, I didn't tell you
everything about tonight

807
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,803
but now you see why we have to do this.

808
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:33,636
Do what?

809
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:35,228
Mandy, what are you talking about?

810
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,438
We're going to kill Old Aunt Ethel.

811
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,188
I'm gonna blow her fucking head off.

812
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,398
Calm down, Mark.

813
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,408
You guys are crazy, you can't kill her.

814
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,241
Why?

815
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,078
She's killing poor,
innocent children, Melissa.

816
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,158
How can you let that happen?

817
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,448
We have to call the police.

818
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:48,598
Those kids will be fucking dead

819
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,328
before those cops ever get
here with a search warrant.

820
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,008
I'm gonna blow her fucking head off.

821
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,978
I can't do this, I
can't fucking kill her.

822
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:00,253
Look, there's a kid at the door.

823
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:06,209
Trick or treat.

824
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:09,222
That's my nephew, Gio!

825
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:10,057
Gio!

826
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:14,588
You can't go running up
there, screaming like that.

827
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,557
You'll never see him again.

828
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,438
Let go of me.

829
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,347
Listen to me.

830
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:19,283
Look at me, you dumb bitch!

831
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:22,448
There's a right way to do this, okay?

832
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,368
We're gonna save your nephew, I promise,

833
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,918
but not like this.

834
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,913
I need you to calm down and trust me.

835
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,488
So, look at "Miss
Toughy Pants" now, huh?

836
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,588
Just a second ago you didn't
want anything to do with this.

837
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,421
Now look at you.

838
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:37,048
It's different, Mandy,
she has my nephew.

839
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,708
It's always someone's
nephew, someone's brother.

840
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,138
Someone's sister.

841
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,198
It's funny how everything changes

842
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,078
when it's your own family, isn't it?

843
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,628
Well, I know exactly
how it feels, Melissa.

844
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,280
Aunt Ethel took a sister from me.

845
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,370
She took my brother from me.

846
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:54,208
Guys, I didn't know.

847
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,423
I'm so sorry.

848
00:54:00,432 --> 00:54:02,558
You ready to kill this fucking bitch?

849
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,110
I'm ready to kill this bitch.

850
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,483
Let's kill this bitch.

851
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:31,330
Gio.

852
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:43,528
You can't cause a seen
by letting him see you.

853
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,258
If he starts screaming and yelling,

854
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,578
Aunt Ethel's gonna come out here

855
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,708
and we're gonna lose
out chance to end this

856
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,687
once and for all.

857
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:53,363
We're going to save him,

858
00:54:54,578 --> 00:54:55,411
okay?

859
00:54:58,359 --> 00:54:59,889
Come on.

860
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:20,128
All right, all you have to do

861
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,400
is wait for me to get inside.

862
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:24,886
Okay?

863
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,121
Then you're gonna knock on the front door

864
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,268
and distract Aunt Ethel.

865
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,638
She's gonna think it's trick-or-treaters.

866
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,896
When she opens the door,

867
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:35,731
bang,

868
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:39,006
I blow her fucking head off.

869
00:55:42,144 --> 00:55:43,311
You guys okay?

870
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:46,257
Hey.

871
00:55:47,212 --> 00:55:48,959
I got this.

872
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:50,128
Just trust me.

873
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,084
I love you.

874
00:56:05,781 --> 00:56:07,488
What are you girls doing there?!

875
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,340
Nothing.

876
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,213
Hey,

877
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,243
you're that girl from the other night.

878
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,038
And you brought a friend with you?

879
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,138
Yeah.

880
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,619
Trick-or-treat.

881
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:21,795
Well,

882
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:24,863
I'm so glad you came back.

883
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:29,633
I have some delicious treats inside.

884
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,503
Come with me.

885
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:46,491
Mmmm.

886
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:49,906
Sit.

887
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:51,771
Sit.

888
00:57:02,164 --> 00:57:02,997
So,

889
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,250
where are your costumes?

890
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,758
I'm dressed as her
and she's dressed as me.

891
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,591
Yeah.

892
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:13,373
We were trying to be funny.

893
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,433
Not impressed.

894
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:20,608
Mmmmm.

895
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,013
Mmmmm-mmmmm.

896
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,173
Care for some of my famous
homemade pickled chocolates?

897
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,951
No, thank you.

898
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:36,588
We've already eaten so much candy tonight.

899
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,743
Well don't look disgusted.

900
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,681
They're delicious.

901
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:42,971
Mmmmm.

902
00:57:42,973 --> 00:57:43,806
Hey!

903
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:45,504
Hey!

904
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:47,739
Oh my God.

905
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:51,427
Dude, we're fucked.

906
00:57:53,994 --> 00:57:56,968
I can never get enough of 'em.

907
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,803
Oh man.

908
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:01,621
Mmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmm, mmmmm.

909
00:58:02,526 --> 00:58:03,609
Hey!

910
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:06,572
Hey, what the fuck?!

911
00:58:06,574 --> 00:58:09,241
I can never get enough of 'em.

912
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:12,052
They are so good.

913
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,833
I make 'em myself, you know.

914
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,733
Homemade.

915
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,070
Can I use your bathroom, please?

916
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,311
Yeah.

917
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:40,740
Sure, it's in the back, there.

918
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,118
Come with me, Melissa.

919
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,256
I'm gonna go
with her, if that's okay?

920
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,091
Mmhmmm.

921
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,548
What are we gonna do?

922
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't know, I don't know.

923
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,308
Let's just climb out this window.

924
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,988
No, we can't leave without Gio.

925
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,113
Right, okay.

926
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,308
Think, think, think.

927
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,983
Look for anything we can use as a weapon.

928
00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:03,818
Okay.

929
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,298
Did you find anything yet?

930
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,892
Not unless we can use a
toothbrush or a toilet brush.

931
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,148
You girls all right in there?

932
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,908
Yeah, we'll be right out.

933
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,797
Well, you
have some company here.

934
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:22,921
Company?

935
00:59:22,923 --> 00:59:26,300
Yes, your friend is here to see you.

936
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,188
Okay, okay!

937
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,758
Sit, sit, sit.

938
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,398
He wants it to be a surprise.

939
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,643
Yes, he wants it to be a surprise!

940
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,713
Stay right there and I'll be right back.

941
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:08,643
Look who's here to save you.

942
01:00:08,645 --> 01:00:10,062
Isn't that sweet?

943
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:11,930
Awwwww.

944
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:14,862
"Hey,

945
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:16,795
"look at me.

946
01:00:16,797 --> 01:00:19,865
"I'm the coolest kid in school

947
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:23,271
"and I'm here to save you."

948
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,328
He's here to save you.

949
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,328
Mark?

950
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,603
Oh, right.

951
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,153
So, listen,

952
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,968
I slit this throat.

953
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:41,768
He's only got about 15 seconds to live.

954
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,998
So, little girls, you got
anything you wanna say?

955
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,203
Mark, I'm so sorry.

956
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,233
You know what?

957
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,063
Yep.

958
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,203
I was wrong.

959
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,238
He's dead.

960
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,631
He didn't hear a word you said.

961
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,981
Fucking bitch!

962
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:07,078
You're fucking dead!

963
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,238
No so fast, sunshine.

964
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,758
Does this look familiar?

965
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,323
Your little friend here
said I could have it.

966
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,618
I've never had a gun before.

967
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,983
I can't wait to try it out.

968
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,038
You having fun, buddy?

969
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,929
Yeah.

970
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,414
Hey, let's check out the next house.

971
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:32,328
Hey, hey!

972
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,578
Calm the hell down, buttercup,

973
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,018
unless you want me to
lay you down beside her.

974
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:37,935
Is that what you want?

975
01:01:37,937 --> 01:01:39,558
No, no.

976
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,793
Well then get a hold of yourself.

977
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:45,948
Get up.

978
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,523
Come on, get over here.

979
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:53,882
Get up and get your ass over here.

980
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,138
Push your little friend
here out of the chair

981
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,698
and sit down in it.

982
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,358
What?

983
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,839
Oh, is this too hard?

984
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:07,233
Push him out of the
chair and sit down in it.

985
01:02:09,176 --> 01:02:10,009
Oh.

986
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,825
Would you put some muscle into it?

987
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,530
Oh, for Lord's sakes, let me.

988
01:02:20,818 --> 01:02:22,058
Now, was that too hard?

989
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,183
Now sit down!

990
01:02:24,586 --> 01:02:27,297
What are you going to do?

991
01:02:29,196 --> 01:02:30,928
Little poor baby.

992
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:34,268
Listen, don't take it too personal.

993
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,298
You're taking it too hard.

994
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,635
Please don't do this.

995
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:40,624
"Please don't.

996
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:41,876
"Please don't."

997
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,753
There is good news.

998
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:52,338
I need to deliver 31 souls.

999
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:57,340
You get to end it
because you're number 31.

1000
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:58,723
What do you mean?

1001
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,263
Do you believe in witches?

1002
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,498
No.

1003
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,378
How about curses and evil spells?

1004
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,568
No.

1005
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,573
Well you should.

1006
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,688
On this very day, 40 years ago,

1007
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,663
a witch put a curse on me.

1008
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,948
I need to deliver 31 souls

1009
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:26,718
for every day that dead walk.

1010
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,758
And you, little bunny,

1011
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,053
make 31.

1012
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,998
If I make 31, then Gio's 32.

1013
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,740
You don't have to kill Gio.

1014
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:36,575
Who?

1015
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,188
There's a little boy in your barn.

1016
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,118
His name is Gio and he's my nephew.

1017
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,578
If I'm 31 then he's 32 and
you don't have to kill him.

1018
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:50,638
Please, just take me and let him go.

1019
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,566
Yeah, sure.

1020
01:03:51,568 --> 01:03:53,258
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1021
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,668
How will I know you'll
let him go if I'm dead?

1022
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,208
You'll just have to trust me.

1023
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,128
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1024
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,098
Jesus Christ, just wait a second!

1025
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,908
Oh, come on!

1026
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,168
I'm dying to use this thing again.

1027
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,562
Please, there must be another way.

1028
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,563
Trick or treat.

1029
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:48,415
Okay, it's done.

1030
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,618
There's your 31st soul.

1031
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,223
Can we go home now, please?

1032
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,933
I forgot to mention one little thing.

1033
01:04:59,936 --> 01:05:00,767
What?

1034
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:02,438
What, are you going to let us go?

1035
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,303
Oh, you can go.

1036
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,693
Then why are you laughing?

1037
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,948
The only way my curse

1038
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,420
could ever be broken

1039
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,400
is if someone else offered
to take the 31st soul for me.

1040
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,303
What?

1041
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,410
You

1042
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:34,493
took the 31st soul for the dead.

1043
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,530
What does that mean?

1044
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,920
Well that means that you

1045
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,615
are the cursed one now.

1046
01:05:50,422 --> 01:05:51,255
No.

1047
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,192
No.

1048
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:10,470
Aaah!

1049
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,528
In 31 hours

1050
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,363
or less,

1051
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,808
you will receive a message.

1052
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:23,573
It will tell you everything
you need to know.

1053
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:31,564
Oh my God, it was just a dream.

1054
01:06:31,566 --> 01:06:32,649
Jesus Christ.

1055
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:08,692
No.

1056
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:11,050
No.

1057
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:16,994

1155
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:51,248
So where are you looking at, that light?

1156
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,908
I'm looking at Austin's nipples.

1157
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:54,741
I'm serious.

1158
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:55,678
Yeah.

1159
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,528
No, I'm serious.

1160
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:57,608
That's like where I'm looking,

1161
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:00,638
is right, ironically,
where his nipples are.

1162
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,898
Okay, nipples, got it.

1163
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,679
Right, so from Joe's
nipples to Austin's nipples.

1164
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:06,817
That's my nephew, Gio!

1165
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:07,652
Gio!

1166
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,191

01:14:18,612 --> 01:14:20,482

1174
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:29,490

01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:31,562

1176
01:14:33,992 --> 01:14:35,987
Ugh.
