1
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,513
Once upon a time in New York,
there was a cop named Charlie.

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,436
He was a very decent guy,
as was his partner, Bo.

3
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,189
He was a good listener.

4
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,069
He loved kids.

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,336
He had patience
and common sense.

6
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,936
He was resourceful.

7
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:34,363
Okay people, let's go.
Step lively now, come on.

8
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,584
He was just a good cop.

9
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,760
Charlie lived happily in Queens,
where he was born and grew up.

10
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,097
- Yo, Charlie!
- Jesu!

11
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,309
- Kill anybody today?
- Didn't even wound anybody.

12
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:09,106
- You won't see your wife?
- I mustn't surprise her at work.

13
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:14,236
Charlie was married to Muriel.
She hated Queens.

14
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:19,199
If he was a detective,
he'd have decent clothes.

15
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:25,873
- But he's got to wear the uniform.
- I feel for you. You have ambition.

16
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,710
I never pushed him enough.

17
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,755
If he was on the take,
I'd say, "He has initiative!"

18
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,968
My sister was married to a cop.
It's a no-win situation.

19
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,055
Either they're honest and broke,
or crooks that never come home.

20
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,558
What did she do?

21
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:49,688
She left him and married an
electrician. That's real money.

22
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:55,485
I'm running out of patience.
I'm a person who needs money.

23
00:03:56,195 --> 00:04:01,491
And then there's Yvonne, a waitress,
who gets some terrible news.

24
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:07,998
Miss Biasi, it says here that you
owe $12,000 on your MasterCard.

25
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:13,587
Those charges were incurred by my
ex-husband, after I threw him out.

26
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,381
The bank is not aware
of your divorce.

27
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,678
We're not divorced yet, but I told
him to tear up the credit cards.

28
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,850
If you're not divorced yet, you're
liable for your husband's debts.

29
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,687
I'm divorced in my heart.
That's what counts.

30
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,191
Legally, that's not what counts.

31
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,696
Do you know how much it costs?
Have you ever been divorced?

32
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,912
Probably not. Probably you've
had good luck your entire life.

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,791
Which is the opposite of me.

34
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:56,755
If the MasterCard is in your name,
it's your responsibility.

35
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:02,845
Listen, please. I came to New York
five years ago, to be an actress.

36
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,683
I was in "Our Town". I played Emily.
People cried buckets.

37
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,729
- I'm sure they were.
- Will there be anything else?

38
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,067
So I come to New York,
and I meet Eddie.

39
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:22,447
Talk about the worst luck of all!
He swept me off my feet.

40
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:27,411
He bought me flowers,
he took me to real restaurants.

41
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,039
With linen, wine and good lighting,
you know?

42
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:36,253
It was perfect, except he turned out
to be a pathological liar.

43
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:42,759
I believed every word he said,
because I had faith in people.

44
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,519
So, in short...

45
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,982
What are my options here?

46
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,799
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne
lived in a city -

47
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,887
- where people pray
for miracles every day.

48
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,641
Like winning
the $64-million lottery.

49
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:37,731
My name is Angel. This story...
Well, it's pretty much all true.

50
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,658
I had a dream last night. I got
three cherries on a slot machine, -

51
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,745
I had a dream last night. I got
three cherries on a slot machine, -

52
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,625
- but they were the face of
my dead father. It's a sign.

53
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:02,422
- But you hated your father.
- No matter. A sign is a sign.

54
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,469
- You think I'm nuts, but we'll win.
- I didn't say you were nuts.

55
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:14,601
I said the odds of winning the
lottery are not overwhelming.

56
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,022
One bedroom in Queens
is not my idea of living.

57
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:25,696
One bedroom is fine. If we had kids,
it would be another story.

58
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:30,492
- We can't afford to have kids.
- Of course we can!

59
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:34,371
Cops have kids!
Firemen have kids...

60
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:39,835
- That's why we have public schools.
- Just get the ticket!

61
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:46,008
She's got to get real. You got to
tell her, "I'm out here every day, -

62
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:52,055
- getting paid, bringing it home."
She's got to listen to you.

63
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,352
- You can't be serious!
- It takes two minutes.

64
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,397
I'm starving, man!

65
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:06,987
This is police business, step aside.
It'll take two minutes...

66
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,408
This will take forever. And
Burger King's another five blocks.

67
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:17,915
- It's only across the street.
- What, that place? Oh, no...

68
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,802
- Where the hell were you?
- I told you. A personal matter.

69
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:36,558
- Then it comes off your pay cheque.
- But I have sick days coming!

70
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:42,022
You want a sick day, get sick.
If you're healthy, you work.

71
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,776
Get me some coffee.

72
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,948
On your head, sweetie pie.

73
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:58,872
- That guy sets a nice tone.
- Yeah, like a drill sergeant.

74
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,875
Here we go.

75
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:10,175
- You want some coffee?
- Please.

76
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:18,350
- You guys know what you want?
- Cheeseburger and blueberry muffin.

77
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,774
And you, Officer?

78
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:30,654
You recommend
the lobster thermidor?

79
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:38,453
That's really funny.
I'm gonna die laughing.

80
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:44,042
- Especially today. What a treat!
- You've had a bad day?

81
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:52,176
- Call me when you're ready.
- A meatball sandwich. Really!

82
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,722
Meatball?

83
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,352
You are very brave, Officer.

84
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:10,777
- She likes you, she really does.
- I was trying to cheer her up.

85
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:16,700
- Store alarm on Spring Street...
- Well, I'm full!

86
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,370
I'm gonna starve to death.

87
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,627
Your turn to pay.

88
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:33,383
- Miss, we've got to run.
- After that whole routine?

89
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,056
- When those radios go off...
- Where, where?

90
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:48,899
Two coffees plus taxes...
Two, even.

91
00:10:54,738 --> 00:11:00,077
Oh, Jeez... I'm short.

92
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,414
- Fine, Officer. No charge.
- No, it's the tip...

93
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:09,086
- I'll live!
- I can't not leave a tip.

94
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,926
A lottery ticket?

95
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:20,973
With my luck? Go, get the cat
out of the tree, or whatever...

96
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,435
No, that's the Fire Department.

97
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,106
- Come on, Charlie!
- In a second.

98
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,568
I got an idea.
What's your name?

99
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,156
Yvonne? I'm Charlie Lang,
and we're partners.

100
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:45,164
If I win, I give you half. If not,
I'll leave a tip. What do you think?

101
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,333
- I'll never see you again.
- You'll see me tomorrow.

102
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:53,589
- Well, I'll be here.
- You've got a deal.

103
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,901
- All right, five more minutes.
- I ordered Chinese. Come up!

104
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,862
- In a minute.
- Are you whipped?

105
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:24,578
No, I've got adult responsibilities.
Next batter!

106
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,543
That's it!
I'm out of here.

107
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:37,799
- Jesu! Vien aqui, la comida.
- I'm coming, Mom!

108
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:44,264
- Are you whipped, Jesu?
- It's my mother, that's different.

109
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,603
Did you have surgery last night?

110
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:54,691
You mean these?
No, it's just a prosthetic bra...

111
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,863
Charlie, don't do that next to me!
That's disgusting.

112
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:04,451
- I'm just soaking my feet.
- Please!

113
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:14,503
- Since when did this bother you?
- Since now, okay?

114
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,881
You're spilling water everywhere!

115
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:23,262
I'll call the Red Cross
and tell them we're a disaster area.

116
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:28,559
I have some larger ones
that I change into after work.

117
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,230
Charlie...
Should I get my boobs done?

118
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:38,527
- Done?
- Enlarged. So I could be like that.

119
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:46,869
Are you nuts?
It seems so extreme.

120
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:51,999
- Forget it.
- I just don't think you need it.

121
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,800
Look, I had to declare bankruptcy.

122
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:07,681
When will I be able
to get my MasterCard back?

123
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,899
What are my chances?

124
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:23,780
- Under 15,000 a year...
- Shall I speak to them? Love to.

125
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,953
I see.

126
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:38,629
Well, thank you.
That's what I thought.

127
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,382
- What did they say?
- My chances are slim to none.

128
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,303
The lotto jackpot has grown
to over $64 million.

129
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:50,974
We'll check the winning numbers
when we return.

130
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:58,690
- You got the numbers wrong!
- Wrong?

131
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:05,197
- Our anniversary is the 27th.
- We always celebrate on the 26th.

132
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:10,994
We got the licence on the 26th.
We got married on the 27th.

133
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:16,124
- So why do we go out on the 26th?
- I don't know, maybe it's custom.

134
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,254
The fact is,
I told you our anniversary.

135
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:25,342
To anybody with any sense,
that means the day they got married.

136
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:29,054
I am sorry, darling.

137
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,432
Did he say 26?

138
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:39,565
Those numbers again are:
6, 12, 16, 26, 64, 84.

139
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,736
We won!
We got the jackpot!

140
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:51,785
- That's unbelievable!
- We're rich!

141
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:57,541
- The jackpot?
- We're rich, rich, rich!

142
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,671
- What are we having?
- BLT down with turkey bacon.

143
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:09,011
- Any Miracle Whip?
- Yes. No matter how broke I am.

144
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:13,974
You have to have things
that are stable. Permanent.

145
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:19,229
- Oreos, Smuckers...
- Exactly.

146
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:23,859
- Thank you.
- Will there be anything else?

147
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,073
Will there be anything else?

148
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,578
There'll never be anything else.

149
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:38,499
God, I hate this.
I feel bankrupt.

150
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,960
What?

151
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,964
A bowling team
had the same numbers!

152
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:51,303
- They get nine million!
- Why am I not surprised?

153
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,266
- How many are on the team?
- Average team is twelve guys.

154
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:01,396
Do each of them get a piece,
or do you consider them as one?

155
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:05,943
Muriel... your veins,
they're bulging out of your neck.

156
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,029
You look like a psycho.

157
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:19,498
Oh, my God. The bowlers,
thank God, only count as one.

158
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:24,795
That's 16 people that picked
these numbers... Oh, God.

159
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,881
That only leaves us with...

160
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,968
Four million.

161
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:35,430
We could live on that, right?

162
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,226
We could live on less, even.

163
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:45,232
Let's pray nobody else calls in,
so we don't have to split it again.

164
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,739
What?

165
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:58,954
What? You're making me nervous.

166
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,836
Honey...

167
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,427
I've got something to tell you.

168
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:21,018
- A complete stranger? Charlie!
- I owed her a tip.

169
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,855
A tip?
Two million dollars? Come on!

170
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,358
I never thought we'd win, darling.

171
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:34,198
- But we did win, like I said.
- But not with your numbers.

172
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,368
Don't do that!
Because you know and I know -

173
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:42,206
- that in my dream,
my dead father came.

174
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:48,378
In his eyes he had dollar signs.
And a "4" in place of the pupil.

175
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:53,675
That's ridiculous. He was a nut job,
he prayed to chickens.

176
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:57,638
He wants us to have
the four million.

177
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:04,561
If he intended us to have half,
there would have been a "2".

178
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,401
It's not the right thing.

179
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,615
The right thing?
What the hell is that?

180
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,744
You've always done the right thing
for everybody else.

181
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:26,458
Just once, please,
do the right thing for us.

182
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,921
I gave her my word.

183
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:37,719
- Honey... Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

184
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:43,642
Then stiff her. Stiff her
and smell the flowers. For me.

185
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:52,317
- What would you do?
- I'd buy the Knicks.

186
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:58,115
- I mean, about the girl.
- I'd take her to watch me play.

187
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:02,619
I'd start myself as
a very small, round forward.

188
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,623
So you agree with Muriel?
Giving her half is crazy?

189
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,877
If I can't have the Knicks,
I want season tickets -

190
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:14,840
- where you sit with Jack Nicholson
and Spike Lee.

191
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:21,305
- A promise is a promise.
- And a stereo for the whole house.

192
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:25,934
So you don't have to carry around
that boom box.

193
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:30,063
I could tell her I just won $5,000.

194
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,736
So... season tickets,
stereo system, Mazda GL6?

195
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:41,825
- I couldn't just lie like that.
- A boat! I've never been on one.

196
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,955
- Are you listening?
- You'll do the appropriate thing.

197
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:51,460
- Which is?
- I don't know. That's your field.

198
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:06,183
Tuna on whole wheat, one scrambled
soft, toast crisp, tea with lemon.

199
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,521
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

200
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,569
- You're back.
- I said I'd be back.

201
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,281
- Coffee?
- No, thanks. I just wanted to...

202
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:27,871
I'm sorry I was so rude yesterday.
But it was the worst day of my life.

203
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,208
Yvonne, wake up!

204
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:35,420
- You're all dreaming.
- Quit the socialising!

205
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:39,842
Don't go,
I want to apologise in detail.

206
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:46,640
Western for Walter. And for Timothy,
oatmeal like Mom used to make.

207
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:51,812
My mother never made oatmeal.
She never made food in her life.

208
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,149
Bloody Marys, she made.
White Russians...

209
00:21:56,358 --> 00:22:00,571
- But she had a great personality.
- So did lmelda Marcos.

210
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:05,450
- She produced a nice son, right?
- You're okay.

211
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,745
Eat!

212
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,045
- He's got it, huh?
- Yeah, a couple of years.

213
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:23,385
He's really starting to go downhill.
In and out of hospital...

214
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:30,058
What a world! We should appreciate
every moment, not be spiteful.

215
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:35,314
- I know just what you mean.
- Yvonne!

216
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,984
Speaking of which...

217
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:46,950
What I have is a bill for $9.53.
What I do not have is the $9.53!

218
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,788
- He went to get his wallet...
- Never let them out the door!

219
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:55,751
- What is this, a soup kitchen?
- I made a mistake.

220
00:22:55,959 --> 00:23:02,466
You sure did! The $9.53 comes out of
your cheque. Bring me some coffee.

221
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:23,278
Let me!

222
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:32,955
Enjoy!

223
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:41,296
- Now that's coffee!
- So, what'll it be?

224
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:45,384
- They're right there...
- Amazing, but true.

225
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:50,681
- We've no cantelope or grapefruit.
- I'm not hungry.

226
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:55,394
The thing is...
I got something for you.

227
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:01,775
- For me?
- It's just a trifle.

228
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,657
May I?

229
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:15,539
It's a string for your glasses,
so they hang around your neck.

230
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:20,961
So you'll know where they are.
At all times.

231
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,890
This is... the nicest thing
anyone's ever gotten me.

232
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:39,188
- I certainly hope not.
- It's close.

233
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:43,066
You sure I can't get you anything?
Coffee?

234
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:47,613
Decaf, please.
I've reached my target heart rate.

235
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:51,200
Decaf it is!

236
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:58,499
- So... You've had bad luck?
- Unbelievable!

237
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:02,628
When I was eleven,
my dog died of parvo.

238
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:07,132
I don't know to this day
what parvo is.

239
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:13,388
I married the wrong man.
I mean the wrong, by a lot, man!

240
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:19,645
Now I can't afford to get divorced.
I mean, I'm used to my luck...

241
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:26,401
But yesterday, I went bankrupt
before I came into work.

242
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:31,865
That's why I was so rude to you.

243
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,118
You went bankrupt?

244
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:39,122
- Look! From the officer.
- That's sweet, honey.

245
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:44,336
About our little agreement...

246
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:50,676
Double the tip, or
half of what I won in the lottery.

247
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:56,348
- That agreement...
- Let's make it your choice.

248
00:25:56,515 --> 00:26:01,478
Door one, double the tip.
Door two, half my winnings.

249
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:05,566
My choice? Okay...

250
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:11,947
Whatever. I'll take door number two.
I'll take half of the lottery.

251
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:18,078
- You're sure?
- Positive.

252
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,423
- I hoped you'd say that.
- I'll bet! Better luck next time.

253
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,510
Actually, we were pretty lucky.

254
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:38,473
- Did you win something?
- We won something.

255
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:42,186
We won something?
What did we win?

256
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,939
Four million dollars.

257
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:54,698
Why are you doing this?
This sick joke!

258
00:26:54,865 --> 00:27:02,581
- It's not a joke.
- No? What you're saying to me...

259
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,710
You think I'm making this up?
I'm not! We won.

260
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:13,258
The lottery? The actual New York
State lottery? Four million dollars?

261
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,512
It happened last night.
It would have been more, -

262
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,142
- but a bowling team took
about nine million out of the pot.

263
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:27,189
And you're telling me that
you'll actually split it with me?

264
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:33,695
A promise is a promise.

265
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:40,494
Oh, my God...

266
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:49,127
- You all right?
- Oh, my God!

267
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:02,057
Now I know why
all these bad things happened.

268
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:06,979
It's so stupendously, phenomenally,
unbelievably great!

269
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:12,901
Because I had such bad luck...
Who wants ice cream?

270
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:17,364
Who wants pie?

271
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:40,721
Wait a minute!
I can't accept this, can I?

272
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:46,310
I can't accept this!
I want to, so desperately, but...

273
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:51,523
- This neurotic part of me says...
- Accept it!

274
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,944
- How can I?
- I want you to have it.

275
00:28:56,111 --> 00:29:01,325
- With all my heart.
- Yvonne, take it!

276
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:12,044
Muriel, $2 million is still
an enormous amount.

277
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:16,340
You should be
committed to an asylum for life.

278
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:24,348
They should give you a straitjacket
and take you to the loony bin!

279
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,810
Look sweetheart,
you weren't there...

280
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,232
She has customers with Al DS,
and treats them like an angel.

281
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:39,321
- She's got a boss from hell...
- Why not give her all the money?

282
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,699
- Get off my foot!
- We're doing the right thing.

283
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:49,122
And the whole city will admire you.
You'll be a celebrity.

284
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,126
Maybe I could get some
commercial endorsements?

285
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,797
Absolutely. "Muriel Lang,
the woman with the heart of gold."

286
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:03,971
You can endorse shampoos,
conditioners, nail polish...

287
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,892
"Muriel Lang,
the woman with the heart of gold!"

288
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,563
Well, I'd better get
something out of this.

289
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:20,654
- Bowling for dollars!
- I want my cheque, Harry.

290
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,326
Some of New York's luckiest people
are here in Manhattan -

291
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:32,791
- to stake their claim in the
state's $64-million lotto jackpot.

292
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:37,671
- So you promised Miss Biasi half?
- As a tip.

293
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:42,551
A tip? We got a cop that gave
a waitress a $2-million tip!

294
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,430
We're gonna open our own
bowling alley...

295
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:50,225
- You insulted him.
- Next time, you talk!

296
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,604
I'd like a little cottage
in the country.

297
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:03,697
- Excuse me!
- Mrs. Lang, how do you feel?

298
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:10,287
- I'm Mrs. Lang!
- Mrs. Lang? These are for you.

299
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:17,294
- What an incredible woman you are.
- You have no idea!

300
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:21,965
Does it bother you that he split
$4 million with a stranger?

301
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:26,512
Not at all. In the beauty parlour,
I'm known as:

302
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,974
"Muriel Lang,
the woman with the heart of gold."

303
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:34,561
And if there are any sponsors
out there, like Denorex...

304
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,106
Which I use, because...

305
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,611
We've got to get the winners
in a group picture.

306
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:46,365
- Miss Biasi, what will you buy?
- A car? An apartment?

307
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:52,830
- I haven't thought about it yet.
- A promise is a promise.

308
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:56,667
"Muriel Lang,
woman with the heart of gold."

309
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:01,964
Oh, actress... briefly.
It didn't work out.

310
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:08,595
"Denorex.
Works out each individual dandruff."

311
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,393
- Will you stay on the force?
- I'll buy the force!

312
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:19,189
- Yvonne?
- So it's "Yvonne" already?

313
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:23,360
- Is this your biggest tip?
- Definitely!

314
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:32,452
- Have you ever won before?
- Never!

315
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,622
Big smile, everybody!

316
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:13,452
She has no taste. That outfit
looked like it came from the 60's.

317
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:17,456
I thought she looked just fine.

318
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,876
She's not flashy.
She's just a waitress.

319
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:25,214
Beauty is my business,
defer to my judgement.

320
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:32,262
My God, it's Bendel's! What a
feeling, to come here with money.

321
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:39,686
- God bless you.
- Stop giving it away to every bum!

322
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,526
God bless you.

323
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:52,407
- Now I'm happy.
- I'm glad, sweetheart.

324
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:59,081
- Now I'm at peace with myself.
- I'm glad, sweetheart.

325
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,336
Just a quick stop at Tiffany's,
and I'll be born again.

326
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:09,007
Fur's for animals,
not for people!

327
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,432
Excuse me.

328
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,806
This is Eleanor Smith of
MasterCard. You are now eligible, -

329
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:44,228
- Miss Yvonne Biasi,
for a $20, 000 line of credit.

330
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:49,691
Please call me at 1-800-555-2000.

331
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:55,155
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- Hi Yvonne, congratulations.

332
00:35:55,322 --> 00:36:01,078
My name is Paul, and I'd like you
to spank me with a wire brush.

333
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:05,457
That's disgusting.

334
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,382
- I've got to change my number.
- Hello, please leave a message.

335
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:19,721
Hello? Sweetheart?
C'est moi!

336
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,850
I'll bet you're there!

337
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,604
I know you're mad about the account.

338
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:32,651
- But I can explain.
- Stay out of my life, Eddie.

339
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,320
You are there.
Hi, baby!

340
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,324
The only reason you're calling
is the lottery.

341
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:43,245
What? You won something?

342
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,291
- Die!
- No, baby. I'm serious.

343
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:52,588
I've been out of town.
The lottery? That's fabulous.

344
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:57,593
You did good?

345
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,012
I did all right.

346
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:06,476
Well, that's great, baby. No one
deserves it more. I mean that.

347
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,313
From the bottom of my heart.

348
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:16,820
- Hello?
- Please, don't ever call me again.

349
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:28,707
- When are you retiring?
- I'm not retiring! Get off my case.

350
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,960
Where's that sense of humour?

351
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:36,882
A guy calls at 3 a.m., says
he's holding a gun to his head...

352
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,302
Unless you give him $1,000
he'll pull the trigger.

353
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:44,515
If he called me at 3 a.m.,
I'd tell him to do it.

354
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:49,144
- That really happen?
- Last night. This lottery thing...

355
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:54,399
- You become this other person.
- I feel bad for you, baby.

356
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:58,904
I'm not bad-mouthing it.
I'm just saying, it's an adjustment.

357
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:05,327
Sun. How are things
in the mysterious East?

358
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:10,290
- Very good. Very busy.
- No unjustified price increases?

359
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:15,212
Good! Two coffees,
one regular, one light.

360
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:28,517
- How's the wife?
- She has the flu.

361
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,202
On the house.

362
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:52,749
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

363
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:58,839
Down there, make a right.

364
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:03,719
Our favourite Korean
is getting robbed right now.

365
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:08,223
- He said his wife has the flu.
- She'd work if she was dead!

366
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,187
- Then he gives me coffee for free.
- Shit! How do we play it?

367
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:18,233
Stay here, I'll go through the
basement. Call for some back-up.

368
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:23,655
Faster!

369
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:27,868
Nobody moves!
A carton of Virginia Slims!

370
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,768
That cop's just sitting out there.

371
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:56,605
Don't worry about the cop.

372
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,401
What was that?

373
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:05,614
Come here.
Watch him!

374
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:11,245
Come on, pal. Move!

375
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,837
- What's back there?
- Nothing.

376
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:24,508
- What about that door?
- Basement. Just rats.

377
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,969
- Rats?
- Big ones.

378
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:31,515
I hate rats.
Don't you keep this place clean?

379
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,440
Nobody move!

380
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,362
What's with this cop?

381
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:49,741
He's got nothing better to do
than write tickets?

382
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:53,162
With all the crime in this city?

383
00:40:53,370 --> 00:41:00,294
- What do we do?
- Wait, till he leaves.

384
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:07,050
- What if he doesn't leave?
- He'll leave. Just shut up!

385
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:21,190
- What's the matter?
- I think it's a heart attack.

386
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,905
- Shut up!
- Call a doctor.

387
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:31,658
I'm the doctor here, honey!

388
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,596
Get up, Charlie!
You all right?

389
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:57,851
Get inside,
there's another one inside.

390
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,647
Come on, Charlie, get up.
You all right?

391
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:07,736
- Why didn't you just shoot him?
- Too many customers.

392
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:12,991
- You all right, man?
- Yeah... I'm great.

393
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,416
Oh man, you got shot!

394
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:29,550
He saved lives and prevented
injuries, though not to himself.

395
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:33,387
And certainly not
to the criminals he stopped.

396
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:38,725
So I give to Officer Charles Lang
this citation for bravery, -

397
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:42,145
- and wish him a quick recovery.

398
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,317
Thank you very much.

399
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:54,533
I guess fate's telling me to
take it easy. Or so says my wife.

400
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,664
I love being a cop,
lottery or no lottery.

401
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:04,334
I think it's the
most important job in the world.

402
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:10,757
So I'll be donating $10,000
to the Policemen's Widows' Fund.

403
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:16,013
Thanks a lot!

404
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:22,227
You're too young
to be hanging around.

405
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:25,689
I'm injured.
Don't you read the papers?

406
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:31,236
- You're a hero? Play with one hand.
- If I could, I would.

407
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:34,615
- See you.
- Yeah, see you later.

408
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,012
Good afternoon, sir.

409
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:06,355
- This looks like Beirut!
- Isn't it great?

410
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:11,026
We'll go co-op next year,
and sell the apartment.

411
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:16,240
- Mr. Patel told me.
- Hi, I'm your accountant.

412
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:20,702
- All the best on your new fortune.
- Thank you.

413
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:26,375
- He says we'll get $100,000 for it.
- Minimum!

414
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:30,295
And we beat the taxes
if we move to Jersey.

415
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:36,343
- But I want to stay here.
- And do what? Play stickball?

416
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:42,391
It's the architect.
Excuse me!

417
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,769
- Where's my chair?
- I gave it to Goodwill.

418
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:50,440
But I loved that chair!
You could have asked me.

419
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:57,656
Why should I? You're the one
that loves to give everything away.

420
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:03,954
Women! Who can live with them?
And without them?

421
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:05,956
What?

422
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:17,593
Gray's Antiques
had another break-in.

423
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:22,139
Two brothers walked off
with a Biedermeyer chest.

424
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:26,435
Gray says, "How could
black guys know what it's worth?"

425
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:30,355
He said that?
What did you say?

426
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:36,153
"They must get the African-American
Antiques Newsletter."

427
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,573
He pissed me off.

428
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:45,996
- I miss you, man.
- I'm going out of my mind.

429
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:50,542
My house is a wreck,
and I've got nothing to do...

430
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:55,297
Well, that's retirement.

431
00:45:55,506 --> 00:46:02,095
- Well! "Yvonne's".
- She bought it a few weeks ago.

432
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:07,351
- Can I get you anything else?
- Tea, please.

433
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:11,355
Eight wants tea.

434
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:17,903
- How's the soup?
- Not enough basil.

435
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,199
You're kidding...
I'll see what I can do.

436
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:27,871
- Go in. Say hello.
- Forget it, she's busy.

437
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:32,459
I know you're dying to go in there.

438
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:37,923
No, I've got to get home.
But I got you something.

439
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,093
Season tickets to the Knicks.

440
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,556
- They're not on the floor...
- Knicks tickets? For me?

441
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:51,103
- I couldn't get the floor.
- Don't worry, give me some!

442
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,566
- Knicks tickets!
- I'm glad she's doing well.

443
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:10,455
Why the coat?
It's a warm night.

444
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,834
Maybe I'll get a chill later.
Just hold it.

445
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:28,515
- There's a lot of people here.
- Isn't it great?

446
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:33,145
I feel like
we're at the Academy Awards.

447
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:37,691
I'm going to go circulate.

448
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:51,955
Here's your lipstick.

449
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:57,794
I won $55 million, and
increased my net worth 40 percent -

450
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:00,881
- through well-chosen mutual funds.

451
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:05,511
- 40 percent?
- At virtually no risk.

452
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:11,308
S & L funds, Biotech funds...
Gold funds, they were a disaster.

453
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:16,355
- Stay away from those.
- What about Treasury Bills?

454
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:22,110
They're for little old ladies.
Which you certainly are not.

455
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:25,781
Aren't you a tiger!

456
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:54,101
Why can't you change 20 dollars?
You drive all day!

457
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:59,606
- We go get change.
- No, you have to break this.

458
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,734
Hi!

459
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:06,947
Hi... Can you break a 20?

460
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:17,666
Repeat after me:
"Keep the change."

461
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:21,879
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

462
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:31,722
- Oh my God, the boat!
- Oh, no! Wait!

463
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:47,905
I suppose your wife is...

464
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:52,910
She's in her element. Stockbrokers,
accountants. She'll enjoy it.

465
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:58,999
- What about you?
- I hate boats. I'm relieved.

466
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:05,255
- I think this is sturgeon.
- Definitely not.

467
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:10,135
- It's like velvet.
- Scottish salmon. The very best.

468
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,513
More champagne?

469
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:18,268
- It's not bad, for a Californian.
- You're not kidding. Fooled me.

470
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:23,649
- This is living.
- And it's just beginning.

471
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:29,488
- You can say that again!
- And it's just beginning.

472
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:39,289
Thank you.

473
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:49,174
It's a pleasure to have you here.
A cocktail? Some champagne?

474
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:53,762
Champagne? Champagne.

475
00:50:55,138 --> 00:51:01,645
- You decided not to be an actress?
- I decided to become a waitress.

476
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:05,816
I had the "tress" part right.

477
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:09,653
And I was a great waitress.

478
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,948
I saw you bought the place.

479
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:18,579
- I passed by the other day.
- And you didn't come in?

480
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:23,542
Well, I... I figured you were busy.

481
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:28,005
Please, you have to come in
and see what I did.

482
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:33,552
I have a table with your name on it,
for people who can't afford a meal.

483
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,931
Of course.
After what you did.

484
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:42,978
What I did? I made a promise
and I kept it, period.

485
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:47,649
- Most people would do the same.
- Nobody would!

486
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:54,323
Are you kidding?
What you did was like a fairy tale.

487
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:04,041
And everyone gets to
live happily ever after?

488
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:23,769
- Well, that's a hopeful sight.
- You think?

489
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:28,065
I always wonder...
What's in store for them?

490
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:31,360
Are they going to be happy?

491
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:36,907
If she puts on 50 pounds,
will he love her anyway?

492
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:43,038
- How long were you married?
- Three years.

493
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:47,751
To an actor named Eddie.

494
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:52,881
Who suggested, if we had a child,
that we name him Al Pacino.

495
00:52:54,925 --> 00:53:01,181
- Al Pacino Biasi.
- Come on!

496
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:22,369
Muriel and I met in high school,
in one of those cooking classes -

497
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:27,916
- where the boys dress like chefs.
And there might be a fire drill...

498
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:35,299
- And you're outside in your aprons?
- Exactly. Even now, I get chills.

499
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:39,761
Anyhow, we started dating, and...

500
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,560
Muriel was the first girl I ever...

501
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,607
Really?

502
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:57,362
- Oh. Well, that's sweet.
- I guess.

503
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:04,328
We went to get the marriage licence,
and there was this other couple...

504
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:08,790
Orthodox Jews.
It was an arranged marriage.

505
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:14,838
They weren't allowed to see each
other. They couldn't get a glimpse.

506
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:20,719
And I thought, "They don't
even know if they're attracted."

507
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:25,849
"They don't know if they've
got anything to talk about."

508
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:32,231
Now, ten years later, I bet they're
happily married with six kids.

509
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:38,904
But Muriel and I have nothing
to say. I don't know what happened.

510
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:43,951
We're on two different channels.
I'm CN N, she's "Home Shopping".

511
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:12,229
How would you feel about dancing?

512
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:19,278
Oh, I'd... be in favour of it.

513
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:43,070
When I was on night shift,
I felt like an explorer.

514
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:48,075
There's this whole other city
that goes on all night long.

515
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:51,995
- Am I talking incessantly?
- Yes.

516
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:56,667
But I like it.
I myself am a talker.

517
00:56:56,834 --> 00:57:03,006
It's nice to meet somebody you
can just talk with, and hang with.

518
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:09,513
Look... here's the thing.
I'm free all the time, basically.

519
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,643
So if you ever want to do something,
or you want company...

520
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:20,232
Really?
How about tomorrow?

521
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:23,819
- Too soon?
- No, not at all.

522
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:29,158
Okay, great. I'll have
Carol watch the register, -

523
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:33,245
- and you could pick me up at noon?

524
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,373
I'll be there.

525
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:42,212
Goodnight.

526
00:57:55,809 --> 00:58:01,231
Weirdest thing happened.
I thought I'd dropped my wallet.

527
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:06,695
Weirdest thing happened.
I came out because I felt seasick.

528
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,367
Weirdest thing happened...

529
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:12,576
- I have some ideas for you...
- Weirdest thing happened.

530
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:17,206
- I have some ideas for you...
- Weirdest thing happened.

531
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:21,084
Wasn't the veal fabulous?

532
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:26,298
That was what was so weird.
I expected chicken.

533
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:29,968
I would have come sit with you,
but Mr. Gross...

534
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:33,764
Jack Gross.
Pleased to meet you, Officer.

535
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:37,851
He's going to help us develop
an economic strategy.

536
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:43,649
- What a great idea.
- She's some girl. Smart.

537
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:48,737
Beautiful...
And she knows what she wants.

538
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:52,282
- See?
- I agree.

539
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:58,121
Thank you very much for a
very stimulating evening, Mr. Gross.

540
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:02,918
- If you ever need any advice...
- I will be calling.

541
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,673
Ready?

542
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:12,761
- I got to get my coat.
- Bye-bye.

543
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,991
- You're doing great!
- I never had great balance.

544
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:38,245
I tried skiing. They threw me off
the "Peter Rabbit" slope.

545
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:43,041
- Your knees. That's the problem.
- One of them!

546
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:49,673
There's a little bit of a hill here,
so you might want to watch it.

547
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,843
- Slow down!
- I can't.

548
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,346
- Sure you can!
- Sure I can't!

549
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:03,770
Charlie, turn!

550
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:14,364
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

551
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:19,661
I'll catch leprosy from the water,
but otherwise I'm okay.

552
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:24,500
So I guess this is it
for you and rollerblading?

553
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,044
I would have to say yes.

554
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:34,885
Okay, your turn. What next?
What do you want to do?

555
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:46,897
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just won the lottery.

556
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:52,069
Tonight's ride home is on me
and Miss Yvonne Biasi.

557
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,454
- What's going on?
- They're treating everybody.

558
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:20,973
- This is going to be hard to top.
- I'll top it.

559
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:30,899
Welcome to Charlie Lang,
Yvonne Biasi, -

560
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:34,611
- Officer Bo Williams -

561
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:39,783
- and all the kids
from Woodside, Queens.

562
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:27,915
I know, I know.
I'm trying.

563
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:21,320
It was a great day for me, too.

564
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:28,452
- What the hell is she doing?
- She's pissed, whatever it is.

565
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:38,795
- Congratulations, Mr. Token Man.
- Oh God!

566
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:19,586
- Honey, I'm home.
- No, you have to leave.

567
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:24,508
- Stop eating my macadamia nuts!
- Give me a kiss.

568
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:30,931
- You can't stay here. Out!
- Why? You expecting company?

569
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:35,185
Not Officer Krupke, the saintly cop?

570
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:39,189
There's nothing going on.
And he's not a saint, -

571
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:43,986
- simply a decent human being.
Something you couldn't...

572
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,655
If you eat one more of those...

573
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:53,036
- Are you having an affair?
- No, we just hang out together.

574
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:57,833
You should have heard that bitch
downstairs talking about it.

575
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,006
What's the real issue here? Us,
or what some idiot neighbour thinks?

576
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:08,385
It's been like a cold war.
If I try to talk about it, you...

577
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:13,265
- I just tried to make you happy.
- No, that's not all.

578
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:16,977
I used to come home,
and you'd hug me.

579
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:22,900
You'd kiss me and ask how my
day was. When did you do that last?

580
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:27,279
It's not important.
It's history.

581
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:31,575
- You go around with this girl!
- I'm not having an affair.

582
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:36,705
This thing between you and the cop
is none of my business.

583
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:41,627
But... there is one thing
that's very important. This:

584
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:44,588
Don't be afraid.

585
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:50,511
"The Eddie Biasi Players!"

586
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:57,768
You want money.
Of course you want money.

587
01:06:57,935 --> 01:07:03,607
Just fifty grand in seed money.
Then we're off. Picture this...

588
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:10,030
Of course not. Not Mr. Saintly.
You're too good to have an affair.

589
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:14,827
I'm just so sick of it!
Your niceness and decency.

590
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:20,791
You're nothing. A working-class
stiff. Blue collar all the way.

591
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:31,677
I'm not gonna change, Muriel.

592
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:36,765
I know.

593
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:42,938
- So I want a divorce.
- You want a divorce?

594
01:07:43,147 --> 01:07:45,691
As soon as possible.

595
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:51,864
I have wings, Charlie.
I want to fly.

596
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:03,876
Honey?

597
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:10,632
The bottom line is, I'm
sticking around until you kick in.

598
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,887
You stick around.
I'm out of here.

599
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:20,809
Where are you going, big shot?
The Plaza?

600
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:23,395
Yeah, the Plaza.

601
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:27,774
If you're here when I get back,
I'll call the cops.

602
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:33,238
And believe me, I am now
in a position to get them to come.

603
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:49,713
- Where you going?
- A hotel.

604
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,383
- You mean, you and her...
- We're history.

605
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:59,515
- Can't say I'm surprised.
- No? It's funny, I am.

606
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:04,728
No matter what comes before,
you don't expect this.

607
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:10,234
- What hotel, Charlie?
- The Holiday Inn on Ninth.

608
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,197
Holiday Inn?
Charlie, you won the lottery.

609
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:19,910
One night at least,
stay at the Plaza.

610
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:27,084
Maybe I will.
You're a real pal, you know that?

611
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:30,504
I'll see you guys.

612
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:59,283
Good evening.

613
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:03,787
I'd like to get a room.

614
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:08,834
I'm not that waitress,
if that's what you're thinking.

615
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,712
I didn't think so.

616
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:16,758
- Single or double?
- A single.

617
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:21,805
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Non-smoking.

618
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:27,311
Sir, can I help you?

619
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:46,330
- He moved back in.
- She threw me out.

620
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:50,375
811 is this way, ma'am.

621
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:57,841
Sir?
If you'll just follow me...

622
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:42,344
- That was the cop.
- That's the waitress.

623
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:04,741
Checked your bathroom yet?
There's a robe.

624
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:09,079
- Are you serious?
- Swear to God!

625
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:17,462
- Well... goodnight.
- Come in.

626
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:31,059
Unbelievable! Your room is exactly
like mine, just a different colour.

627
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:35,397
Would you like some fruit?

628
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:42,237
You have some in your room.
Every room probably has fruit.

629
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:46,950
- There's really a robe?
- Terry cloth.

630
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:52,247
Nice... really nice.

631
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:58,754
It's for sale. You can buy it
for like $100. I think it's $100.

632
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:02,883
I'll do it.

633
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:08,138
I'll split it with you. We'll share.
You have it one month, then me...

634
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:15,646
- Or every other day, or weekends.
- Or we could get two.

635
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:32,329
- Why am I so nervous?
- I don't know.

636
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:39,127
- We've spent so much time together.
- Maybe that's why.

637
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,468
Here we go...

638
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:32,848
There they are!

639
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:47,779
- Unbelievable!
- Make yourselves comfortable.

640
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:51,533
- I mean, I've seen some offices...
- Walter, please.

641
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,663
They must charge you an arm
and a leg. Just the chairs...

642
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:01,126
- A glass of water?
- Real leather. I thought so.

643
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:06,340
- Where's Muriel?
- Mrs. Lang just stepped out.

644
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:10,260
And here she is.

645
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:17,434
- You had them done.
- Had what done?

646
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:22,105
- Can we proceed?
- What did she have done?

647
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:27,236
- I'll tell you later.
- Let's cut to the chase.

648
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:32,741
The lottery money should not be
divided. It was Mrs. Lang's ticket.

649
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:37,162
- Completely unacceptable.
- It's all right.

650
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:40,749
She can have my half.

651
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:45,462
Come here.

652
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:50,175
Are you nuts?
You're giving up without a fight?

653
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:53,929
She can have my half, period.

654
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:58,642
- You're talking a million dollars!
- Walter, please!

655
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:02,479
You got to be kidding me!

656
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:10,654
- We concede the point.
- That's a very mature attitude.

657
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:18,620
As to their pre-lottery holdings,
we have a bank account totalling...

658
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:27,671
...$3,611.
I insist we split this 50-50.

659
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:32,050
Chump change.

660
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:38,724
That's basically it. There's
furnishings, some good linens...

661
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:42,352
Not quite accurate, Mr. Zakuto.

662
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:49,193
We are also attaching the monies
given by Mr. Lang to Miss Biasi.

663
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:52,196
That is out of bounds!

664
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:58,368
Mr. Lang volunteered his wife's
earnings without her consent.

665
01:16:58,577 --> 01:17:04,041
That's horrible, Muriel. Please,
think about what you're doing.

666
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:08,295
We believe that he and Miss Biasi
had a long-standing relationship -

667
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:12,466
- that he deliberately
deceived his wife about.

668
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:16,720
And we have drafted a letter
to Miss Biasi -

669
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:22,518
- demanding that she return the
money in full, or face penalties.

670
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:27,147
- I can't believe this!
- I can't listen to this screaming.

671
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:32,402
- Our whole marriage was like this.
- It was not.

672
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:35,322
Is this just to get even
with Yvonne?

673
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:40,953
I am tired of your physical abuse.
Did you see that?

674
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:49,127
If you fellows need a cab,
my secretary will call one.

675
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:55,092
How am I going to say this
to Yvonne?

676
01:17:55,259 --> 01:18:00,597
You'll have to stop
seeing her for a while.

677
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:11,567
This is Yvonne Biasi. Please
leave a message after the beep.

678
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:15,779
Yvonne, I just wanted to say
I'm thinking about you.

679
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:20,450
We'll win this, because it's right.
It's not your fault.

680
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:27,207
I'm at Bo's at 555-3840.
I guess I'll see you in court.

681
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:31,712
I hope you don't mind
sleeping on the floor.

682
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:38,927
- There's beer in the fridge.
- Thanks for the blanket, Tracey.

683
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:45,142
Goodnight, Gail.
I'm sorry.

684
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:09,708
"The trial, which has attracted
citywide interest, begins today."

685
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:14,922
- This whole thing is unbelievable!
- My money's on Yvonne.

686
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:22,012
- What are your birthday's numbers?
- 12, 16, 64.

687
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:26,809
12... 16... 64.

688
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:33,774
And the numbers for
your anniversary, my dear?

689
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:39,530
6, 26, 84.

690
01:19:39,696 --> 01:19:43,116
6, 26...

691
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:49,039
Did I hear 26?

692
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:54,628
As a matter of fact,
weren't you married on the 27th?

693
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:59,842
- Yes.
- So your husband picked 26?

694
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:05,222
- Objection. What's the point?
- The point is, Counsellor...

695
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,934
The point is, Your Honour...
I am demonstrating -

696
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:14,898
- that Mr. Lang is responsible
for the winning ticket.

697
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:18,318
Overruled.

698
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:24,950
So, Mrs. Lang, your husband
picked the 26th on his own, correct?

699
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:28,620
- No.
- No?

700
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:33,709
There was you...
there was your husband...

701
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:38,547
Who else was there that morning?

702
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,097
My dead father.

703
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:57,858
- Excuse me?
- My dead father, God rest his soul.

704
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:03,697
He came to me in a dream. "Baby",
he said, floating out the window.

705
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:10,787
He had these big angel wings,
the perfect colour of white leather.

706
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:16,460
He says, "Baby, it's time to go
to the church. You'll be late."

707
01:21:16,627 --> 01:21:22,216
To my shock, I'm standing there
in my wedding gown.

708
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:28,472
So I run down Queen's Boulevard,
through Flatbush... impossible!

709
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,894
I came to the church:
St. Catherine's of the Holy Lotto.

710
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:39,650
And then I realised I wasn't late,
I was a whole day early.

711
01:21:39,817 --> 01:21:42,653
God, I wanted to die!

712
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:47,115
Then my father was standing
right next to me.

713
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:51,036
And he says,
"Little girl, don't cry."

714
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:58,418
"Because to me, your anniversary
will always be on the 26th."

715
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:03,632
M U RI EL'S DREAM
DEAD FATH ER PICKED WI N N ERS

716
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:11,849
Mr. Lang.

717
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:17,396
Have you ever purchased
nail polish remover for your wife?

718
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:20,482
Quiet, please!

719
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:25,320
Nail polish remover?

720
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:30,492
- A couple of times, I guess.
- And you paid for it?

721
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:35,038
Did you therefore consider it yours?

722
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:38,709
No, I guess I didn't.

723
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:43,839
Did you force your wife
to split the ticket with Miss Biasi?

724
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:47,801
I only said
we should do the right thing.

725
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:52,389
- Were you wearing a gun?
- Of course not.

726
01:22:52,598 --> 01:22:57,144
- You hit her, didn't you?
- I never, ever...

727
01:22:57,352 --> 01:23:01,648
You are under oath, Mr. Lang!

728
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:09,531
- Okay, once I grabbed her arm...
- No further questions.

729
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:17,331
Your witness, Counsellor.

730
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:24,129
Miss Biasi. Would you describe
your financial circumstances -

731
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:29,593
- before Mr. Lang offered you
half his wife's winning ticket?

732
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,096
I was struggling to make ends meet.

733
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:38,060
Isn't it a fact you owed $12,000
on your MasterCard?

734
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:43,482
- That's because my ex-husband...
- Just answer yes or no.

735
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:48,111
Technically, yes.
But I hadn't overspent.

736
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:53,951
Didn't you go bankrupt the same day
he offered to split the ticket?

737
01:23:55,410 --> 01:24:00,624
Yes.
But that was just... fate.

738
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:05,963
- Right, fate...
- Yes. Really.

739
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:11,176
What was your relationship with
Mr. Lang when he made his offer?

740
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:15,556
- I'd never met him before.
- Really?

741
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:18,642
Yes, really.

742
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:23,355
Describe your relationship
with Mr. Lang today.

743
01:24:27,734 --> 01:24:31,822
I love him more than
anything in the world.

744
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:36,785
And you went to the Plaza
with him the day he left his wife.

745
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:42,583
- Objection! What is the relevancy?
- Motivation.

746
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:49,339
Mrs. Lang had thrown him out,
the marriage was in ruins...

747
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:54,928
They're trying to make me into a
gold-digger... him, the media...

748
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,389
Control yourself, please.

749
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:02,519
I've worked all my life. Finally
something wonderful happened.

750
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:07,483
I met a man who was intelligent,
kind and compassionate.

751
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:11,320
Just knowing him has
changed my life. It's not the money.

752
01:25:11,487 --> 01:25:15,949
He made me believe
people were fundamentally decent.

753
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:20,287
I won't let some lawyer
make our relationship look ugly.

754
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:25,417
Are you divorced?

755
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:29,046
You're married to one man,
and in love with another.

756
01:25:29,213 --> 01:25:35,803
- I couldn't afford to get divorced.
- Well, that's convenient!

757
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:42,059
In dramatic testimony,
Yvonne Biasi was depicted -

758
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:47,356
- as a gold-digging nymphomaniac.
A verdict is expected tonight.

759
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:53,779
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honour.

760
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,588
What say you?

761
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:17,094
We rule in favour of the plaintiff,
Mrs. Muriel Lang, on all counts.

762
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:22,516
The court would like to thank
the jury for its service.

763
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:25,394
Court dismissed.

764
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:51,295
- About your affair with...
- Shut up about her!

765
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:54,798
She's down there.

766
01:26:55,507 --> 01:26:58,677
Yvonne!

767
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:13,692
- Mrs. Lang? Your reaction?
- Justice was done.

768
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:16,570
Aren't the good deeds
of your husband...

769
01:27:16,737 --> 01:27:21,700
- We're happy, that's all.
- Very happy.

770
01:29:16,482 --> 01:29:20,319
I don't even know where she is.

771
01:29:21,445 --> 01:29:27,284
Look... You'll be a cop again.
It's what you love.

772
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:30,704
I'll be all right.

773
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:34,541
I'll be all right.

774
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:18,669
Is anyone here?

775
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:21,964
Go away.

776
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:28,053
- You don't want to be with me.
- What are you talking about?

777
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:35,561
- I love you.
- Don't you get it?

778
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:43,068
- I've ruined your life.
- I feel like half of me is missing.

779
01:30:43,235 --> 01:30:49,575
You won $4 million. Do you know
what an amazing gift that is?

780
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:53,745
And because of me you have nothing.

781
01:30:53,912 --> 01:30:57,916
Because of you, I have you.
Why can't you understand?

782
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:06,300
If you don't want me, then
I'll walk out that door forever.

783
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:12,347
But please stop talking about the
money. It means nothing to me.

784
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:23,317
Do you want me to go?

785
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:30,449
No.

786
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:35,954
Never.

787
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:40,876
Never, never.

788
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:48,175
You have to excuse me sometimes,
it's just...

789
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:53,806
Nobody ever loved me before.

790
01:32:25,129 --> 01:32:30,008
- I guess he wants some food.
- Shall we invite him in?

791
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,972
Why not?

792
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:59,580
We should leave New York.

793
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:05,043
I mean, we're like freaks here.

794
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:11,049
I've got a cousin
that lives in Buffalo.

795
01:33:11,216 --> 01:33:14,344
He keeps asking me to visit.

796
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:18,015
Maybe we can stay there for a while.

797
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:22,352
I could join the Buffalo force.

798
01:33:23,812 --> 01:33:28,192
I could be a Buffalo waitress.

799
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:48,754
Tonight, I, Angel Dupree,
photographer for the N. Y. Post, -

800
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:55,886
- had the chance to study grace and
generosity in dire circumstances.

801
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:06,021
In their darkest hour, the stalwart
officer and good-hearted waitress -

802
01:34:06,188 --> 01:34:09,691
- shared a bowl of soup with me.

803
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:14,154
When I left,
the good Samaritan gave me money, -

804
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,990
- wishing it could be more.

805
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:23,997
- "Mail it to Yvonne's Coffee Shop."
- It's a good idea.

806
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:35,425
I just want to make one stop.

807
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:43,934
- Sweetie...
- I'm okay.

808
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:48,147
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- I just wanted to see it again.

809
01:34:48,313 --> 01:34:51,650
Why is the gate open?

810
01:34:51,859 --> 01:34:57,197
I don't know.
Well, Carol has a key...

811
01:34:57,364 --> 01:34:59,741
The door's stuck.

812
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:11,962
- What is this?
- It must be a mistake.

813
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:16,800
- "The Good Samaritan's Fund".
- "Lotto Lovers".

814
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:20,554
"Yvonne's Coffee Shop."

815
01:35:22,306 --> 01:35:27,102
- It's five dollars.
- Oh, come on!

816
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:32,983
"There should be more people
like you. Ethel from Staten Island."

817
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:39,781
Here's a cheque for ten.

818
01:35:43,327 --> 01:35:47,331
This is all for us.
Oh, Charlie!

819
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:26,620
"You are an example to all of us.
Betty and Phil. The Bronx."

820
01:36:27,788 --> 01:36:33,460
"We hope you have a great future.
The Garcias, Long Island City."

821
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:50,227
It took them
three days to open all their mail.

822
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:56,066
When they were done, New York
had given them a $600, 000 tip.

823
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:01,864
Charlie went back to the force.

824
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:10,372
Yvonne got her coffee shop back.

825
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:16,086
Eddie could only get work
driving a cab.

826
01:37:17,588 --> 01:37:21,175
And Muriel...
She married Jack Gross, -

827
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:25,471
- who took her money
and fled the country.

828
01:37:25,637 --> 01:37:30,767
Muriel lives in the Bronx now
and works in a nail salon.

829
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:37,774
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne
all lived in a city -

830
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:43,614
- where people prayed for miracles.
And sometimes they happened.
