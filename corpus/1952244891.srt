3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,103
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

6
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,659
SO WHERE ARE YOU HEADED ?

7
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,661
EAST.

9
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,068
THERE'S A TOWN DOWN THAT WAY.

10
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,571
I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK.
YEAH, WELL.

11
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:28,073
THANKS.
SURE, TAKE CARE.

13
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,515
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

14
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,269
I'LL GIVE YOU ROOM
AND BOARD AND $50 A WEEK.

15
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,272
THE LAST GUY WHO WAS HERE,
HE ONLY GOT $30 A WEEK,

16
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:37,776
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A RUNG OR TWO UP THE LADDER.

17
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,279
YOU SAY YOU DO
DO PLUMBING, RIGHT ?

18
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,963
HI THERE.
HEY THERE, SOLDIER.
TAKE IT EASY.

19
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,465
DON'T WEAR YOURSELF OUT
THE FIRST DAY.

20
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:54,970
THERE'S SOME HAND CLEANER
OVER THERE IF YOU WANNA USE IT.

21
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,473
YUP, IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS SAY.
YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO PACE YOURSELF.

22
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:01,977
I MYSELF TRY NOT TO WORK
TOO HARD.

23
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:04,980
BESIDES, I DON'T NEED
ALL THOSE AIR CONDITIONERS
TONIGHT.

24
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,484

AS THEY SAY IN YOUR COUNTRY.

25
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,987
WELL, I GOT 'EM FIXED.

26

EXCUSE ME.

29
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:25,500

30
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,003
BUT YOU HAVE ROOM.

31
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:32,507

33
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:38,513

34
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,653
PELICAN, DID YOU JUST
RUN THOSE LADIES
OUT OF HERE ?

35
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:48,156
I SWEAR, WE GOT HALF THE PLACE VACANT.

36
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:51,660
HERE'S THE MAIL.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

37
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,162
IF CLAUDINE HAD HER WAY,
EVERY LOST SOUL ON THE CONTINENT...

38
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:57,165
WOULD WANT
A PERMANENT RESERVATION
HERE AT THE SEAGULL.

39
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,168
- HI.

40
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,171

00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,676
NICE TO MEET YOU.
CLAUDINE HERE IS OUR LAUNDRY GIRL.

42
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:11,680
I'VE TOLD HER FOR YEARS,
IF YOU CAN'T WORK BETWEEN THE SHEETS,

43
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,682
YOU MIGHT AS WELL WORK
CLEANING 'EM.

44
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:17,686
STOP IT.
STEFANO HERE IS FROM ISRAEL.

45
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,688
WELL, ITALY.
WHATEVER.

46
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:23,191
HE'S OUR NEW
MAINTENANCE MAN
AND A HELL OF A HAND...

47
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,193
WITH AN AIR CONDITIONER TOO,
BY GOD.

48
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:28,196
WELL, GOOD.
WE NEED A MAN WHO'S GOOD
WITH HIS HANDS AROUND HERE.

49
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,198
THIS ONE FOR DAMN SURE ISN'T.

50
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:32,200
WELL, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

51
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,705
HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT A MAN WITH HANDS
LIKE MINE, HUH ?

54
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,357
OH, HI.

55
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,362
CAN I HAVE ONE ?
ONE OF YOUR CIGARETTES.

56
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,865
YEAH, SURE.  HERE.

57
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,871
SO, IS PELICAN HERE ?

58
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:29,374
UM, YEAH,
HE'S IN THE BACK.
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

59
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,379
THAT'S YOUR PET, RIGHT ?

60
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,383
YEAH.  I USED TO HAVE
THIS BIG STRONG ALLEY CAT,

61
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:41,887
BUT IT GOT HIT BY A CAR,
SO...

62
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:46,391
NOW IT'S JUST
ME AND THE FISHES.

63
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,894
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
ONE OF THESE ?  YOU KNOW.

64
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,896
I MEAN, THEY SAY
IT'S JUST THE SOUND
OF YOUR INNER EAR, BUT...

65
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,399
I LIKE TO THINK IT REALLY IS
THE SOUND OF THE OCEAN.

66
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,401
HERE.

67
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,906
NEAT, HUH ?

68
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,914
THAT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

69
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,918
OH, NO.  THAT'S MY BROTHER PALMER.

70
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:15,921
THAT'S MY EVIL STEPMOM...

71
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:19,424
AND, THERE'S
THE FAMILY MANSION
IN CHARLESTON.

72
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,426
THAT'S YOU, RIGHT?

73
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,930
DON'T LOOK AT THAT PICTURE.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
THAT'S YOUR SISTER ?

74
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,435
NO.  IT'S JUST A GIRL
I USED TO KNOW.

75
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:36,942
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE LOVELY AND THE TALENTED
MISS CLAUDINE VAN DOOZEN.

76
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,444
LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRUG IN.

77
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,947
I THINK THERE'S
NO REASON TO BE SNIPPY...

78
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:45,951
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE MOVED ON
TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS.

79
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,953
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'LL IT BE  
FOR YOU BOYS ?

80
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,956

00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,959
YEAH ?  GETTIN' READY
FOR ANOTHER CONSUMMATION ?

82
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,961
CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY.

83
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,964
IS THAT THE NEW BOY 
I'VE BEEN HEARING
SO MUCH ABOUT ?

84
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,966
YES.

85
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,469
EVER SO NICE, ISN'T HE ?

86
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,471
UH, ROSCOE MEASLES.

87
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,473
HI.
I'M AT YOUR SERVICE.

88
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:11,476
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE KENNETH.

00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,979
I'M AT YOUR SERVICE, ALSO.

90
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:17,482
KENNETH AND I WORK
IN EDUCATIONAL PICTURES.

91
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,484
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
KENNETH ?

92
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:22,988
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP US
WITH SOME EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS.

93
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:26,491
LEAVE IT ALONE, ROSCOE.
NOBODY'S INTERESTED.

94
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,494
OH.  OKAY, WELL, I UNDERSTAND.

95
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:31,997
IT'S, UM, FINE.

96
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,499
AN ACTOR'S LIFE IS
A TOUGH ROW TO HOE.

97
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,501
SO I'LL JUST-

98
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,004
UH, COME ON, KENNETH,
LET'S GO.

99
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,506
I CAN TELL
WHEN I'M NOT WANTED.

100
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,011
TA-TA, KIDDIES.

101
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,514
DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

102
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,017
AH, WHAT WOULD THAT BE,
I WONDER ?

103
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,521
DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM.

104
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,524
THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF TRASH THAT WASHED UP
ON THE BEACH.

105
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,526
OH, SHIT.  I GOTTA GO.

106
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,530
HEY, PELICAN, I'M LEAVING !

107
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:11,036
BYE.
SAY, BY THE WAY, UM,

108
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:14,539
WHAT'S TO DO AROUND HERE
AND THERE AND,

109
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,042
YOU KNOW,
JUST FOR AMUSEMENT ?

110
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,044
AMUSEMENT ?
YEAH.

111
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:22,547
WELL, I USUALLY HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO MYSELF.

112
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,549
GIRLIE STUFF, YOU KNOW.

113
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,054
SO I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE GENTLEMEN DO AROUND HERE
FOR AMUSEMENT,

114
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,056
AS YOU PUT IT.

115
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:34,059
OKAY.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
ONE OF THEM ?

116
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,061
SEE YA.

117
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,063

00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,354
HEY !  HEY !

00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:30,865
YOU LIKE IT ?
IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT ?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. BELLA.

124
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:33,368
BUENO.
BELLISSIMA.

159
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,666
MORNING, LADIES.

160
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,807
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE ?
HEY.

161
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,809
HI.  HOW YOU DOIN' ?

162
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,312
COME ON INTO MY OFFICE.

163
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:54,819
YOU CAN CLEAN YOUR CLOTHES
OR SIT HERE AND TALK TO ME
OR BOTH OR WHATEVER.

164
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,325
WELL, I SHOULD CLEAN MY SHIRT.

165
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,828
OH, YEAH.
I THINK YOU SHOULD.

166
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:07,332
I COULD THROW IT IN
WITH MY STUFF
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

167
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,337
WANT SOME COFFEE ?

168
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,839
NO, THANKS.
OKAY.

169
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,845
I SAW YOU AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT.

170
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:25,850
OH, YEAH ?

171
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,355
WELL, A GIRL'S GOT A RIGHT
TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA 
SPENDIN' MONEY, HUH ?

172
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:45,370
I MEAN, A BUNCH OF OLD PIGS
WANT TO THROW ME SOME OF 
THEIR POCKET CHANGE.

173
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,374
WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO TAKE THEIR MONEY.
I MEAN.

174
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,876
YEAH, I GUESS.

175
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:58,883
SO, WHAT BRINGS
A STRANGER LIKE YOU
DOWN HERE...

176
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:01,386
TO THE END OF
THE CHARTERED EARTH ?

177
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:06,891
WELL, I USED TO LIVE...
IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY.

178
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,893
I JUST GOT SICK OF THE COLD,
THAT'S ALL.

179
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,895
YEAH ?

180
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:15,400
WHAT, YOU JUST WANDER AROUND
WHERE THE CLIMATE SUITS 
YOUR CLOTHES ?

181
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,403
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

182
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,908
AND YOU,
ARE YOU FROM HERE ?

183
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,411
NO, HARDLY.

184
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:30,415
NO, I MOVED DOWN HERE
A FEW YEARS BACK.

185
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,417
THIS FRIEND OF MINE, MARCY,

186
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:36,421
WE JUST SORT OF STAYED 
DOWN HERE TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE.

187
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:41,926
IT'S A NICE PLACE.
FOR A WHILE.

188
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:46,431
YEAH.  YEAH, IT IS.
IT IS.

190
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,754
CLAUDINE.
HEY.  HOW YOU DOIN' ?

191
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:39,760
THAT'S NICE.

192
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,762
THAT'S NICE.

193
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,764
I GOT ONE HERE.

194
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:51,272
YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER PALMER
USED TO HAVE THIS REALLY 
GREAT TATTOO ON HIS ARM.

195
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:55,276
THIS ROSE.
THIS BLACK ROSE.

196
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:59,780
A ROSE AS BLACK AS DEATH.

197
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,782
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS TATTOO ?
IT FELL OFF ?

198
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:05,786
FELL OFF ?  NO, NO,
IT DIDN'T FALL OFF.

199
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,793
NO, MY BROTHER SHOT HIMSELF
ON HIS 16th BIRTHDAY.

200
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:20,301
HE WAS IN THIS...
UPSTAIRS ROOM...

201
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:25,806
THAT SORT OF SERVED AS THIS 
EXTENDED PARLOR ROOM,
YOU KNOW.

202
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:29,310
MY FATHER AND MY STEPMOTHER 
WERE THERE.

203
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,315
ANYWAY, THE NEXT DAY,
I PACKED MY STUFF,

204
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,318
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
BACK THERE SINCE.

205
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:43,324
I'M SORRY.

206
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,827
I'M NOT.

207
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:51,332
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE ANYMORE,

208
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:54,835
UNLESS I'M STARING
RIGHT DOWN AT HIS PICTURE.

209
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,344
YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS 
SCIENCE TEACHER ONCE...

210
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:07,848
WHEN I WAS BACK
IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

211
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,851
I SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR
IGNORING THE MAN,

212
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:14,855
EXCEPT THERE WAS ONE THING
THAT HE SAID THAT I WILL
ALWAYS, ALWAYS REMEMBER.

213
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,860
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAW.

214
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,366
YOU KNOW,
THIS LAW THAT GOVERNED
THE WHOLE WIDE UNIVERSE.

215
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:29,870
THE WAY IT WORKED IS THAT...
ALL THINGS THAT MATTER
WOULD BE RETURNED.

216
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:35,376
YOU KNOW, THAT MATTER ITSELF
ISN'T CREATED OR DESTROYED.

217
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,878
IT JUST LASTS FOREVER.

218
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,384
WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THEM
ANYMORE, BUT THEY COME BACK.

00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,102
I'M PREGNANT.

479
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:04,106
PREGNANT ?
YEAH.

480
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:06,108
OFFICIALLY SO.

481
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:09,612
FUCKING PILLS !

482
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,615
FUCK 'EM !

483
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:28,748
WHAT ARE WE
PLANNING TO DO ABOUT THIS ?

484
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:32,251
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I AM GONNA DO
ABOUT IT, STEFANO.

485
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:35,755
I DON'T KNOW
WHATIAM GONNA
DO ABOUT IT.

486
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:40,760
I'M THINKIN' ABOUT GOING
AND VISITING A FRIEND
FOR A WHILE.

487
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:45,264
YOU'RE GONNA VISIT A FRIEND ?
YEAH.

488
00:49:45,765 --> 00:49:48,267
WHO IS THIS FRIEND ?

489
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:50,770
I'M GONNA GO SEE MARCY.

490
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,272
I JUST NEED TO GET
MY HEAD TOGETHER.

491
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:55,274
I CAN'T EVEN THINK ANYMORE.

492
00:49:55,274 --> 00:49:57,276
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
AND VISIT WITH MARCY.

494
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:02,281
I FEEL REALLY CLOSE TO HER...

495
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:05,284
AND I KNOW THAT IF
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
EVER HAPPENED TO HER...

496
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:07,787
THAT SHE WOULD
BE THERE FOR ME.

497
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:09,789
OH, FUCK IT.

498
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,791
WHAT ?

499
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,795
SO DO YOU FEEL
REALLY CLOSE TO HER OR WHAT ?

500
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:18,798
YES, I DO.

501
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:22,802
DO YOU FEEL REALLY CLOSE
TO THIS PERSON YOU GOT
FUCKING PREGNANT WITH ?

502
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:29,308
OH, GOD.
I KNEW THIS WAS A MISTAKE.
A FUCKING MISTAKE.

504
00:50:49,868 --> 00:50:53,872
ALL RIGHT, I GIVE HIM THE MIX,
MAKE SURE THAT HE HAS WATER.

505
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:56,374
OH, AND CUT HIM UP AN APPLE.
THAT'S IT ?

506
00:50:56,374 --> 00:50:59,878
CORN ?
OH, AND CORN.  OKAY.

507
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,882
I'M TAKING YOU.

508
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:09,387
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
THE STUPID BUS.

509
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:19,898
WHAT'RE YOU WAITING FOR ?

516
00:52:16,204 --> 00:52:18,206
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ?

518
00:52:27,215 --> 00:52:29,217
I HAD THIS BOW AND ARROW...

519
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:33,721
MY BROTHER BOUGHT FOR ME
FOR MY NINTH BIRTHDAY,

520
00:52:34,222 --> 00:52:36,724
AND I USED TO MAKE MARCY
COME OUT ON THE ROOF WITH ME...

521
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:41,229
AND I WOULD SHOOT
TARGET PRACTICE.

522
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:44,732
I KILLED A PIGEON ONCE.

523
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:47,735
I NAILED HIM.

524
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:50,738
SHE DIDN'T TALK TO ME
FOR A WEEK.

528
00:53:46,794 --> 00:53:49,797
SEE THAT BRICK BUILDING ?
OVER THERE.

529
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:53,301
THERE ?
MM-HMM.

530
00:53:53,418 --> 00:53:54,919
HERE WE ARE.

531
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,422
WHERE ?
WE'RE HERE.

532
00:54:04,929 --> 00:54:08,433
I'M SO NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.

533
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:11,436
OH, MY HAIR.

534
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:16,441
HEY, LISTEN, UM,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
WAIT FOR US IN THE BAR, OKAY ?

535
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,443
OKAY.
WE'LL BE UP IN A BIT.

536
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:20,445
DO I LOOK OKAY ?

537
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:22,447
OKAY.

543
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,202
GET YOU ANOTHER ?

544
00:55:01,202 --> 00:55:03,204
NO.  I'M FINE.

545
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:05,706
YOU'RE NOT FROM
AROUND HERE, ARE YOU ?

546
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,708
NO, I'M NOT FROM HERE.

547
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,711
LOOKING FOR A LITTLE ACTION ?
WHAT ?

548
00:55:11,212 --> 00:55:14,081
LOOKING FOR SOME ACTION ?

549
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,585
I'M JUST WAITING FOR A FRIEND.

550
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:27,595
HOWDY, PARDNER.

551
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:30,097
SO, YOU LOOKING FOR A FRIEND ?

552
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:34,101
YEAH, 
I'M WAITING FOR A FRIEND, YEAH.

553
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:39,106
NOW, AIN'T WE ALL ?

554
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:43,110
FRANK P. LAKEBOTTOM,
WICHITA FALLS, TEXAS.

566
00:56:30,157 --> 00:56:32,159
HI, STEFANO.

568
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:36,163
HI, MARCY.

569
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:40,167
OH, NO.  
NO, HONEY, THIS ISN'T MARCY.

570
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:44,672
THIS IS MY NEW FRIEND OLGA.
HOW DO YOU DO ?

571
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:47,675
WHERE THE HELL IS MARCY ?

572
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,177
SHE HAS VANISHED.

573
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:54,682
COULD YOU HOLD THIS FOR US ?

576
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:04,692
WHERE THE HELL IS MARCY ?

577
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:07,695
I JUST TOLD YOU, STEFANO.

578
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:09,697
SHE'S GONE, OKAY ?

579
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:12,700
SHE'S GONE AWAY 
WITH SOMEONE.

580
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,704
SOME FAT PIG OF A MAN.

581
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,707
GET IT ?

584
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,222
WE'RE GOIN' DOWNSTAIRS.

585
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:59,747
THIS USED TO BE MY OLD ROOM.

586
00:57:59,747 --> 00:58:02,249
WHERE ?  HERE ?
YEAH.

587
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,768
IT STICKS.

588
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,273
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?

589
00:58:26,273 --> 00:58:29,276
WE'RE GONNA GO IN HERE 
FOR A WHILE, OKAY ?

590
00:58:29,276 --> 00:58:32,279
THERE'S A COUCH DOWN THERE
IF YOU WANNA LIE DOWN.

591
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:19,827
HEY.  GOOD MORNIN'.

592
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:24,331
WHERE IS, UH.

593
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:28,335
OH, WHAT ?
THE LITTLE FRAULEIN ?

594
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:32,840
SHE LEFT SHORTLY AFTER
I BEGAN THROWIN' UP.

596
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:46,821
CLAUDINE.
HEY, CHERRIE.

597
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:49,824
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
BE VERY HAPPY FOR MARCY, CLAUDINE.

598
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:52,326
WELL, I'M VERY HAPPY FOR HER.

599
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:54,328
WHEN SHE CAME BACK
AFTER YOU BETRAYED HER.

600
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:57,331
I THINK THAT'S RATHER
SIMPLIFYING THINGS, CHERRIE.

601
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:59,834
IT WAS JUST AWFUL.
SHE WOULDN'T EAT A THING
FOR WEEKS.

602
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:01,836
I HAD TO FEED HER
WITH A SPOON.

603
01:00:01,836 --> 01:00:05,840
YEAH, WELL, THEN I'M GLAD
SHE'S WITH SOMEONE WHO ISN'T
SO UTTERLY HEARTLESS.

604
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,842
THE MAN SHE'S WITH,
HE'S FROM BRAZIL.

605
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:10,845
HE'S DEPENDABLE,
BOTH EMOTIONALLY
AND FINANCIALLY STABLE.

606
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:14,849
YEAH, WELL, SOMETIMES
DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

607
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:17,351
HERE'S YOUR BOWL
OF DRY CEREAL.

609
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,862
HEY.

610
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:30,865
HEY, PEOPLE LEAVE
OTHER PEOPLE, OKAY ?

611
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:34,368
THAT'S LIFE.

612
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:40,875
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
PHILOSOPHICAL CONTRIBUTION,
STEFANO.

613
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:53,387
SHIT !

614
01:00:57,892 --> 01:01:00,394
LEAVE IT ALONE.

615
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:03,397
COME ON, LEAVE IT ALONE.
NO, YOU LEAVE IT ALONE !

616
01:01:04,899 --> 01:01:07,902
YOU FUCKIN' LEAVE ME
ALONE !

617
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:12,907
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE,
PLEASE ?

618
01:01:13,908 --> 01:01:15,910
NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE.
COME HERE.

619
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:28,422
LOOK, IT HAS BEEN REALLY,
REALLY NICE KNOWING EACH OTHER.

620
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:32,426
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME ?

621
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,929
I JUST THINK THAT IT'S BEST...

622
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:38,432
IF WE BOTH GO
OUR OWN SEPARATE WAYS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?

623
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:43,437
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

624
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:56,450
WAIT A MINUTE.
OH, I GET IT.

625
01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:00,955
YOU THINK THAT I HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

626
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:04,458
OH!  OH, NO!

627
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:09,463
OH, WHAT, YOU THINK
I NEEDED YOU
TO TOUCH ME, HUH ?

628
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:14,969
YOU THINK I NEEDED
YOUR BIG, STRONG, HANDSOME
ITALIAN HANDS ALL OVER ME ?

630
01:02:19,473 --> 01:02:22,476
MAKE LOVE TO ME, STEFANO.

631
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:24,979
MAKE LOVE TO ME NOW !

633
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:31,986
OH, THAT IS SO FUCKIN' SAD.

634
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,488
I'M SO SORRY.

635
01:02:34,488 --> 01:02:39,493
AND I HOPE YOU KNOW
THAT YOU WERE NOT HERE...

636
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:42,496
FOR ANY OTHER REASON 
THAN TO DRIVE.

637
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:49,003
OR THAT AND THE OCCASIONAL
ADEQUATE...

638
01:02:49,003 --> 01:02:52,006
TOSS IN THE HAY, HUH ?

639
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:58,012
I TRY NOT TO THINK
WHY YOU DO ANYTHING,
CLAUDINE.

640
01:03:00,514 --> 01:03:02,516
THIS IS STUPID.

641
01:03:02,516 --> 01:03:06,520
IF YOU'RE TOO FUCKIN'
COWARDLY TO LEAVE,
I GUESS I HAVE TO !

642
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,522
HEY !
I'M SORRY.  I'M SORRY.

643
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:15,529
CHEERS.

644
01:03:33,664 --> 01:03:36,667
HEY !  SHE WENT THAT WAY.

646
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,082
HEY.

647
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:11,085
I'M SORRY.

648
01:04:12,586 --> 01:04:14,588
I'M SORRY.

649
01:04:29,603 --> 01:04:31,605
HEY.

650
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:36,110
GOT YOU SOME THINGS.

651
01:04:40,614 --> 01:04:42,616
THIS IS FOR YOUR HEAD.

652
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,622
AND THIS, THE LADY
AT THE PHARMACY
GAVE IT TO ME...

653
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:51,125
AND SAID IT'S GOOD
FOR YOUR MORNING SICKNESS.

654
01:05:12,646 --> 01:05:14,648
IT HURTS ?

655
01:05:39,173 --> 01:05:41,175
ARE YOU HUNGRY ?

656
01:06:09,703 --> 01:06:11,205
GIVE ME THIS.

657
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,213
WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING 
LIPSTICK ON FOR HERE ?

658
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,223
YOU GIRLS AND YOUR MAKEUP.

659
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:55,749
DO YOU LIKE ME ?

660
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:06,760
COME ON.

661
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,302
DID YOU EVER...

662
01:07:48,802 --> 01:07:53,307
DID YOU EVER FALL IN LOVE
WITH A MAN BEFORE ?

663
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:57,311
I MEAN, I KNOW WITH A GIRL.

664
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,313
BUT WITH A MAN ?

665
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:22,836
I WAS IN LOVE
WITH A BOY ONCE.

666
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:26,840
A BOY ?

667
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,842
WHAT HAPPENED ?

668
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:37,851
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
 STEFANO.

669
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:44,358
WE WERE JUST KIDS.

670
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,361
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

671
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:54,868
ANYWAY, I LET THAT
GO BEHIND ME
A LONG TIME AGO.

675
01:10:07,691 --> 01:10:10,193
HEY.

676
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,713
ALL RIGHT. 
YOU CAN RELAX NOW.

677
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:32,716
IT'S A PERFECTLY 
NATURAL OCCURRENCE.

678
01:10:34,217 --> 01:10:36,219
YOU, UH, MAY NOT KNOW THIS,

679
01:10:36,219 --> 01:10:40,724
BUT ONE IN EVERY TWO PREGNANCIES
ENDS IN A MISCARRIAGE.

680
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:45,228
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU
TO REMEMBER...

681
01:10:45,228 --> 01:10:48,732
IS THAT YOU'RE YOUNG,
HEALTHY, AND YOU'RE STRONG.

682
01:10:48,732 --> 01:10:52,235
GIVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE TIME,

683
01:10:52,736 --> 01:10:55,739
THERE'S NO REASON
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO MAKE SOME YOUNG MAN...

684
01:10:55,739 --> 01:10:57,741
A VERY HAPPY DADDY.

685
01:11:05,248 --> 01:11:07,751
"VAN DOOZEN," HUH ?

686
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:10,253
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
FROM THE CHARLESTON AREA,
WOULD YA ?

687
01:11:10,253 --> 01:11:12,255
YEAH.

688
01:11:12,255 --> 01:11:14,257
MINNOW BAY ?

689
01:11:14,257 --> 01:11:16,259
YEAH.

690
01:11:16,259 --> 01:11:20,263
ARE YOU RELATED TO
CLAUDE VAN DOOZEN,

NO KIDDING.

693
01:11:26,269 --> 01:11:28,271

694
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:31,775
MY BROTHER WENT TO
OFFICER TRAINING
WITH OLD CLAUDE.

695
01:11:31,775 --> 01:11:34,778

AS THEY USED TO CALL HIM.

YEAH, I'M FINE.

702
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:06,059
YOU KNOW, STEFANO,
I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT...

703
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,563
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE ALREADY
PRACTICALLY HERE AND EVERYTHING,

704
01:12:09,563 --> 01:12:13,066
YOU KNOW,
SO CLOSE TO CHARLESTON,
I WAS THINKING MAYBE I COULD,

705
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:16,570
I COULD DRIVE UP THERE
TO THE OLD FAMILY HOUSE...

706
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,572
AND SPEND THE NIGHT...

707
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:21,074
AND COME BACK TOMORROW.

709
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:28,582
OKAY.  LET'S GO.

710
01:12:31,585 --> 01:12:35,589
NO.  I WANNA GO BY MYSELF
THIS TIME,

711
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:37,591

WITH YOU.

712
01:12:40,093 --> 01:12:43,096
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE VERY LONG.
I JUST WANNA GO UP THERE AND,

713
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:47,601
YOU KNOW,
SPEND THE NIGHT,
AND... I'LL COME BACK.

714
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:50,103

715
01:12:50,103 --> 01:12:52,105
