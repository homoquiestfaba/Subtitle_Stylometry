1
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,144
I am General Wilkins,

2
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,580
and this is the
McArthur Outreach Survival Camp.

3
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:55,143
If any of you gentlemen
are in the habit of running,

4
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,950
well, good luck.

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,524
There are no fences here,

6
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,115
no barbed wire,

7
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:06,461
only 70 miles of rugged desert
in all directions.

8
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,363
Perfect, don't you think?

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,533
I think there has been a mistake.

10
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,077
Um... I am supposed to be
at the First Baptist Bible Camp.

11
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,941
No, no, son.
There is no mistake.

12
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,678
You're in the right place,
and I am your personal savior.

13
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:32,952
Gentlemen, you get caught
outside the perimeter,

14
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,687
you earn a day in the pipe.

15
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:41,028
Steal water,
you earn a day in the pipe.

16
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,729
Be late for a meal,
you get the pipe.

17
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,272
Next time you come up,
don't forget the eggs.

18
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,974
You use a four-letter word,

19
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:55,480
you're gonna get one long day
in the pipe.

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,818
Stone, what is the current
temperature in the pipe?

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,514
One hundred and forty degrees, sir.

22
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,022
One hundred and forty.

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,922
Any questions?

24
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:11,295
Wouldn't that be considered
cruel and unusual punishment?

25
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,924
Cruel... maybe.

26
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,901
Unusual... yeah.

27
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:18,868
Yeah, absolutely!

28
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,337
I say you're breaking the law.

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,465
Let's get one thing straight,
gentlemen.

30
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,406
I AM THE LAW!

31
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,412
Now, do we have any more
stupid questions?

32
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,977
You'll find your uniforms
at your assigned bunks.

33
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,178
Put them on!
Keep them on!

34
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,618
DISMISSED!

35
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,019
MOVE IT!

36
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,622
Go! Go!

37
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,562
Kinda cruel, huh?

38
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,327
What, what, what was that?

39
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:32,809
The guard said he sleeps in his truck
just on the other side of that hill.

40
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,903
Let's go.

41
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,246
What a dream.

42
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,430
This thing is a piece of crap!

43
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,095
Just take it easy with it, okay?

44
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,139
Man, this thing better not die on us.

45
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,875
# They say I gotta
a learn a lesson today #

46
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:04,909
# Yeah! #

47
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,103
# Hey, hey, hey! #

48
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,079
# They say I need
a good punch in the face #

49
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:09,876
# Yeah! #

50
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,177
# Hey, hey, hey! #

51
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,047
# They say
I started something up #

52
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,949
# I got mad at you #

53
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,316
# And I revved you up #

54
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,411
# But yeah, hey, hey ##

55
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,213
Yes?

56
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,484
Senator Boxwell?

57
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,286
Speaking.

58
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,417
General Wilkins.

59
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,392
It is about your son, Justin.

60
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,861
He's AWOL.

61
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,765
Where are we, man?

62
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,993
I am looking...
I'm looking.

63
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,764
Seventy miles into the Mojave Desert
and you lose him?

64
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,771
What would you like us
to do, Senator?

65
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,500
Talk to me!

66
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,200
Turn right onto Highway 6.

67
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,969
Are you sure?

68
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,772
National Geographic thinks so!

69
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,545
Are we tracking them yet?

70
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,241
Satellites are coming in.

71
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,779
You think they're back there?

72
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,116
If they are not, they will be.

73
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,247
Senator, I need an answer.

74
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,848
Find him, quietly.
You understand me?

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,520
Yes sir,
I'll uh, see to this personally.

76
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,119
You have my word.

77
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,559
Where is Highway 6?

78
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,932
Apparently the map
is older than the truck.

79
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:09,906
I don't get it.

80
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,477
According to this
they are right behind us.

81
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,412
Where did you place
the tracking devices?

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,454
Inside their hats, sir.

83
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,350
So much for technology, Stone!

84
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,858
Idiot!

85
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,090
It's gotta be the same road.
Go right.

86
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,926
We went right last time.

87
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,045
Elder Johnson and Elder Talbot,
this is President Andrews.

88
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,411
Your new assignment is to serve
in the town of New Harmony.

89
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,417
It's been two years
since the last missionaries

90
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,781
were transferred out...

91
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,583
This tape will self-destruct
in six seconds...

92
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,682
...so, you will need to be
on your best behavior.

93
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,851
That is funny!

94
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,791
Remember the mission...

95
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,863
And of course,
should you be captured

96
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,864
and tortured
by squirrel monkeys,

97
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,026
this office will deny
this mission ever existed.

98
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,933
Bishop Hollister has already...

99
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,437
Squirrel monkeys?

100
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,234
Yeah, squirrel monkeys.

101
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,831
...so, you'll be teaching...

102
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,740
They exist!
I've seen pictures.

103
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,279
You'll be doing a great work
in this town, Elders.

104
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,373
I look forward to hearing from you
after you have gotten settled.

105
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,917
- What was that?
- Are you crazy?

106
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,212
God speed, Elders.

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,254
There was a squirrel monkey
in the road.

108
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,289
It is a good thing
my cat-like reflexes

109
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,688
and quick instincts kicked in.

110
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,384
Elder, we have been
together long enough

111
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,054
for me to know that there
is nothing quick about you.

112
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,299
Hey Elder, I was kidding!

113
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,770
Want to see what blessings
have been bestowed?

114
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,967
Oh, absolutely!

115
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,805
Hooo, haha, haah!

116
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,139
Oooho! Yeah!

117
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,702
Oooho!

118
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah!

119
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,110
Wow!

120
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,411
Man, you've got
one amazing girlfriend.

121
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,212
It's from my sister.

122
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,091
Oh.

123
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,419
Is she writing anyone?

124
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,152
She's 12.

125
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,926
Well, when I'm 28.

126
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:15,966
Let it go, Elder!

127
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,835
Ha haa.
Catholic!

128
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,311
Disgusting!

129
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,680
Gluttony's a sin, Elder!

130
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,380
I will just assume you are
warming that one up for later.

131
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,748
Ha ha ha.

132
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,718
Which way are we going, General?

133
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,772
That's just great!

134
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,907
The carburetor
is completely clogged.

135
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,015
We got $300 dollars, okay?

136
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,708
That's good enough
for two bus tickets.

137
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,843
Do you see a bus station
around here?

138
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,252
We are in the middle
of the Mojave Desert.

139
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,584
So can't you fix it?

140
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,283
If I had a set of tools

141
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,860
and ten gallons
of carburetor cleaner.

142
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,259
I am just trying to help.

143
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,126
I'm just trying to think of a plan.

144
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,290
I just need to relax.

145
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,297
We're dead.

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,095
We're dead?
We're dead?

147
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,227
Why you gotta be so negative
all the time?

148
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,737
Open your eyes, T!

149
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,399
We are in the middle
of a very big desert.

150
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,670
You know what?
Our luck could change, man.

151
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,213
All right?

152
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,146
You know how I feel
about swearing, T?

153
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,343
Luck is a four-letter word,

154
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,317
and I'd prefer
you stop using it!

155
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,648
That's what I'm talkin' about,

156
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,687
all that negativity, man!

157
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,086
You need to chill out!

158
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,353
You sound more like
the General every day.

159
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:58,468
# <i>Till we meet,</i>
<i>till we meet</i> #

160
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,597
It's still a four-letter word.

161
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,039
# <i>God, be with you</i>
<i>till we meet again</i> ##

162
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,577
Be cool.
Be cool.

163
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,124
Hey, guys.

164
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,793
What's wrong with your friend?

165
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,872
Twinkies and this heat.
Bad combination.

166
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,066
What are you guys, salesmen?

167
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,335
Um, not exactly.

168
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,671
We're missionaries

169
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,076
for the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints,

170
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,977
you know, the Mormons?

171
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,208
I thought you guys rode bikes.

172
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,776
Do you know the purpose of life?

173
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,785
Do you?

174
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,116
Actually, yes, it's...

175
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,522
How old are you, Elder Johnson?

176
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,651
Nineteen.

177
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,558
You look 14.

178
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,960
Well, I, I'm not.

179
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,898
Elders have to be 19,
and sisters have to be 21

180
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,093
before we come out.

181
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,198
Come out?

182
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,636
To spread
the gospel of repentance,

183
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,231
and to brings souls to Christ.

184
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,277
- Look, Johnson...
- Elder Johnson.

185
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,640
Whatever.

186
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,214
Don't waste your time
on guys like us.

187
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,146
We are not good candidates
for the priesthood.

188
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,343
Oh, but you're wrong.

189
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,251
I mean, all you have to do
is open your hearts

190
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,584
and listen to the spirit.

191
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,263
I think one of those spirits
has got your friend.

192
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,062
If you have any questions,
uh, just call that number.

193
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,692
We'll send you a free video.

194
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,033
You can call
when you get to a phone,

195
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,369
and watch it
when you get to a VCR.

196
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,446
Elder, are you all right?

197
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,040
No, I am not all right.
Give me something, man!

198
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,587
Not another word, Elder.

199
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,057
Come on.

200
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:14,666
Shirt... pants... shoes...

201
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,071
Toothbrush?

202
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,436
Don't touch that thing.

203
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,705
You don't know where
that thing has been.

204
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,213
These guys must live
in their car, man!

205
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,748
What else is in there?

206
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,083
"Today was the most special
day of my life.

207
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,181
My mom cried when she
dropped me off at the MTC."

208
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,987
The MTC?

209
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,790
Oh, that must be
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

210
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,762
I'll betcha those guys
can really sing.

211
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,098
Hold on a minute, okay?

212
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,472
Ha ha!
Grrr! Grrr! Grrr!

213
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,879
Why'd you do that?

214
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,970
This isn't a time
to be playing around.

215
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,549
- Okay, be serious.
- I am serious.

216
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,675
Oh, yeah?

217
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,754
Well, what's the plan, huh?

218
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,516
Isn't it obvious?

219
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,251
The General is lookin'
for you and me right now.

220
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,656
Right?

221
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,026
But, nobody's looking
for two missionaries.

222
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,655
No.

223
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,030
Ha ha... yes!

224
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,457
Officer.

225
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,296
It took you guys
awhile to pull over.

226
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,334
Is something wrong
with the car?

227
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,961
Yes, as a matter of fact.

228
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,303
Elder Talbot, here,
fell on the shifter,

229
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,069
and it stuck in neutral.

230
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,477
I've been expecting you two
for quite some time.

231
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,573
Look officer,
we don't want any trouble.

232
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,250
Yeah.
Okay.

233
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,995
Hello, it's me.

234
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,759
I've got 'em.

235
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,333
Absolutely.

236
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,992
No problem.

237
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,072
All right, Elders, come with me.
I'll give you a ride into town.

238
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,870
Are you taking us into custody?

239
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,742
Yeah, right.

240
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,576
Good one, Elders.

241
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,910
Come on!

242
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,020
Maybe they just needed the car,
and they wanted to pay for it.

243
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,253
Maybe in their hurry
of stealing the car,

244
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,989
they forgot it.

245
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,826
Well, what are we going to do?

246
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,867
I am gettin' hungry.

247
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,799
Consider it manna from heaven.

248
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,801
I'd rather die!

249
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,769
Well, that is
a distinct possibility.

250
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,204
We'd better get going.

251
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,776
I, uh, I think we should
just stay right here.

252
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,313
Elder, we haven't seen
a single car all day.

253
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,814
That's because
it's been really hot, Elder.

254
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,180
Maybe the cool air
will bring the people out.

255
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,344
Oh!
Hey, everybody!

256
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,617
It's nice and cool now!
COME ON OUT!

257
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,450
I'm going.

258
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,458
I'm staying.

259
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,691
If you're staying here,
you're staying here all alone.

260
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,028
- Fine.
- Fine.

261
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,597
- Bye.
- Bye.

262
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,305
Look on the bright side, Elders.

263
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,746
Some people never get to ride
in a patrol car.

264
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,512
Some of us consider
it home, 'cuz I know I do.

265
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,518
Uh, what's that Elder?

266
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,849
Nothing, officer.

267
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,981
He is just, he's just a little tired.

268
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,582
Don't worry about the car.

269
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,991
We'll make sure it gets
to the repair shop.

270
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,495
You should have it soon.

271
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,894
Thank you, officer.

272
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,905
What's the plan now, smart guy?

273
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,974
Welcome to New Harmony, Elders.

274
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,242
Thank you, sir.

275
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,442
I am Bishop Hollister.

276
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,384
Hi. I am Elder Talbot, sir.
Yeah.

277
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,019
And, you must be Elder Johnson.

278
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,683
Yes, sir, I'm Elder Johnson.

279
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,125
I haven't heard so many sirs
since I was in the army.

280
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,322
Sorry... sir.

281
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,796
Where's your car?

282
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,799
It broke down.

283
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,233
That cop said he would
get it to us soon.

284
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,271
Ah, well, Brother Sorensen
is a good man.

285
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,864
How, uh, how are you fixed
for funds?

286
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,001
Elder Talbot
misplaced our stash.

287
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,214
Yeah, collection...

288
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,579
our congregational collection.

289
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,015
Uh, I'll tell you what.

290
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,746
Why don't you go inside
the diner, show 'em your badges,

291
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,913
and they'll, uh,
they'll put it on my tab.

292
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,857
In the meantime,
I'll put your bags in the truck.

293
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,394
Go on in.

294
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,262
He seems like a nice guy.

295
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,336
Have you ever met a mean Mormon?

296
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,735
# You said the other night #

297
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,002
# That we were through #

298
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,638
# But you keep coming over
like our love is new ##

299
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,345
Hello?
Anyone here?

300
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,744
I'll be right with you,
just take a seat.

301
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,717
You see that?

302
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,057
Lady Luck staring us
right in the face.

303
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,097
Gee, there must be a whole
nine bucks in there.

304
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,069
I hope that guy hurries.
I'm starvin'.

305
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,343
Sorry. We're back there
chopping up onions.

306
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,882
The real waitress will be with you
as soon as she can compose herself.

307
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,950
So, what'll it be?

308
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,953
Uh, a double cheeseburger,
and you can hold the onions.

309
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,955
Oh... well, thank you, brother!

310
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:05,887
Ha ha!

311
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,720
What are you two, salesmen?

312
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,123
No, man.

313
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,593
We're missionaries.

314
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,924
Read the nametag.

315
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll be glad to read your nametag.

316
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,561
Elder "Talbot."

317
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,134
Hmmm... okay, ha ha.

318
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,760
So, let's move on.

319
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,965
Uh, can I get a, uh, club sandwich?

320
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,473
CLUB SANDWICH!

321
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,105
And a couple of Cokes.

322
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,702
AND A COUPLE OF COKES!

323
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,873
Fountain's down.

324
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,646
Fountain's down-- so water
is just going to have to do
for you fellas.

325
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,151
Okay.

326
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,353
Well, all right!

327
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,692
Hello, Sarah.

328
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,819
Oh, hey, Bishop.

329
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,419
Sorry to barge in so late.

330
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,431
I see you've met the missionaries.

331
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,433
Oh, I didn't know
they were the missionaries.

332
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,530
Well, come around and say, "Hi."

333
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,873
Elders, this is Sarah Covington.

334
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,072
She owns the diner.

335
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,207
Didn't you guys order Cokes?

336
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,251
Yeah, he said
that the fountain was down.

337
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,344
Mormons don't drink Coke.

338
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,619
Now, Sarah, you know
that's not altogether true.

339
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,819
Missionaries, on the other hand...

340
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,160
Elder Johnson, you're gonna
have to shake that Coke habit.

341
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,597
It's starting to create problems.

342
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,296
Gee, thanks, Elder Talbot.

343
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,669
Is there anything else
that I am not supposed drink?

344
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,210
Well, besides the Coca-Cola
products,

345
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:37,806
we Mormons don't drink coffee,
or beer, and uh,

346
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,317
we definitely don't smoke,
and no poker on Fridays.

347
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,049
Just follow the Word of Wisdom,
and you'll be fine, Elders.

348
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,024
That's right, wise words of wisdom.

349
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,823
Welcome to New Harmony, Elders.

350
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,936
- You boys ever been to Australia?
- No.

351
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,171
Don't go there.
They're mean as hell there.

352
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,011
My grandson, my great-grandson,
got shot at five times.

353
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,778
I thought they liked Americans.

354
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,184
They'd as soon shoot
a Mormon as listen to one.

355
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,687
Ahh, Sister Cutbank,

356
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,984
I'm sure there are a lot
of great people there.

357
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,322
Otherwise the Lord never would
have sent Timmy down there.

358
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,359
Ahhh, horse sh...

359
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,726
Apples?

360
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,994
Timmy is a pain in the butt,

361
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:33,800
and he deserves a little
hot lead in that same area.

362
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,635
Let's get in before we get drenched.

363
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,868
Well, Elders, this is it.

364
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,935
A place to sleep, a place to wash up.

365
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,981
Uh, this is very nice, Sister Cutbank.

366
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,949
Well, if you need anything
come by the main house.

367
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,646
And, oh... look out for Rusty.

368
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,483
Rusty?

369
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,318
The goat.

370
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,686
You have a pet goat?

371
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,453
I do for now.

372
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:59,190
It's more of a darn pain
than Timmy was.

373
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,265
Shall we pray?

374
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,731
That's a wonderful idea.
Elders?

375
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,976
Elder Talbot, I think that a prayer
would be very appropriate.

376
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,179
Oooh, uh, Bishop?

377
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,341
Would you like
to lead us this evening?

378
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,290
I'd be honored.

379
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:31,920
Dear Heavenly Father,

380
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,659
we are grateful
for our new elders' arrival

381
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,701
this day in safety...

382
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,101
Yes, truly grateful, Lord.

383
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,538
We hope this place will be
a sanctuary for them,

384
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,041
free from the powers of evil...

385
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,611
A sanctuary, Lord, no evil.

386
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,484
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

387
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,849
Amen, ah, ha ha!
Man. Whew.

388
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,854
That's the way it outta be.

389
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,891
You seem to be very excited
about the work.

390
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,121
Uh, yeah, it's my Baptist
upbringing, sir.

391
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,663
Well, you boys
better get some sleep.

392
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,098
No rest for the righteous, son.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

393
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,567
What do you mean?

394
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,570
Uh, he means we better go to bed,

395
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,970
'cuz we gotta preach
come sun up.

396
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,132
Of course.

397
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,273
Bingo!

398
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,477
Uh, well, thank you so much,
Sister Cutbank,

399
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,568
for lettin' us stay.

400
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,544
Oh sure.

401
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,741
Now, don't be surprised
in the morning

402
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,683
if you hear Old Blossom choking.

403
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,516
She's just clearing her pipes.

404
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,817
I love this whole farm thing.
It's cool.

405
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,758
See you first thing.

406
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,589
I'd rather not.

407
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,901
Uh, bears or bunnies?

408
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,594
Bunnies.

409
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,399
Bears.

410
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,803
Yeah.

411
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,688
About time you got out here.

412
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,156
Don't start with me, Daren.

413
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,059
I'm tired, and how many times
have I told you to stay off my hood?

414
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,858
Hey, I stay out here all night

415
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,626
to make sure you make it out
to your car safely.

416
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,031
This is all I get?

417
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,464
Thanks, I'm safe.
Now get off.

418
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,838
Oh, who peed in your coffee?

419
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,605
Or, should I say, "Hot chocolate?"

420
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,873
Shut up.

421
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,380
No coffee?
No tea?

422
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,144
How about a little me?

423
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,244
We're not
boyfriend-girlfriend anymore.

424
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,053
Do I need to staple
a reminder to your forehead?

425
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,717
You used to be
remotely interesting

426
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,797
before you got all religious.

427
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:56,230
You are a mistake for any girl,
religious or not.

428
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,276
You know, I saw your two new
missionary dorks in there.

429
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,743
You are so observant.

430
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,815
I been thinking about
throwing a little welcoming party.

431
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,075
Don't.

432
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,377
Too late, sweet thing.

433
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,119
Already in the works.

434
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,915
I'll send you an invitation.

435
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,458
You're a jerk.

436
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,462
Fifteen, 16, 17, 18-- 18 bucks.

437
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,432
Gimme the two fives.

438
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,565
Gimme the two fives!

439
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,005
Look man, don't screw this up.

440
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,102
You got us covered, right?

441
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,407
Yes.

442
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,476
What do you think?

443
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,919
What do you think, huh?

444
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,526
Whew, you look like one sad cowboy.

445
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,325
I don't know why you waste
your time on her.

446
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,872
You see anybody else around here
that merits wasting time on?

447
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,511
You gotta be 21 to come in here.

448
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,447
Thanks for the reminder.

449
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:14,946
What'll it be?

450
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,118
I'll get a beer in the bottle?

451
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,721
I hate this game.

452
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,325
You next?

453
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,093
Um... sure.

454
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,964
What'll it be... 8 ball, 9 ball?

455
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:44,346
Uh, well, the only one I know
is Solids 'N Stripes.

456
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,075
We call that "Eight Ball."

457
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,016
You wanna light the break?

458
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,179
Light what?

459
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,356
I'll break.

460
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,162
I haven't seen you
around here before.

461
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,561
I haven't been around here before.

462
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,400
You be glad.

463
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,031
Just passin' through, huh?

464
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,805
Like a bad burrito.

465
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,512
Your turn, cowboy.

466
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,075
Name's Justin.

467
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,279
I'm Daren.
This is David.

468
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,679
You guys brothers?

469
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,951
Yeah, we got three more monkeys
just like him back home.

470
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,086
Must be somethin' in the water, huh?

471
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,165
Wait.
What?

472
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,599
Take the straight on the 12--
you'll be set up for the 10?

473
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,696
I think I like this one right here.

474
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,409
Oh, I didn't even see that.

475
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,077
Rack 'em.

476
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,093
What's that?

477
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,560
I lost.

478
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,189
In fact, you did.

479
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,200
But, I'll tell you what.

480
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,998
This one is on me,
but next one's $10.

481
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,682
You break it.

482
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,182
But, I just lost.

483
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:30,015
Well, let's just call it a little
New Harmony hospitality.

484
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,253
Well, you hit from there,
you're gonna scratch.

485
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,830
Shut up!

486
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,869
Is that good?
Huh?

487
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,639
Fifty-five, 60, 62 dollars!

488
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,333
They musta been pissed!

489
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,070
And... I got these!

490
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,475
Ooooh, okay.

491
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,104
Inside rear bumper.

492
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,149
Good work.
Good work.

493
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,510
What are we waiting for?

494
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,919
Well, isn't it a little hot right now?

495
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,821
Those missionaries
are going to be here soon.

496
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,983
We gotta get outta here.

497
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,651
It's a long walk across the desert.

498
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,787
Maybe they got picked up
an' called the cops?

499
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,364
Hey, maybe.

500
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,330
For all they know, we went to Mexico.

501
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,561
The last place they'll look at
is New Harmony.

502
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,203
Yeah. Maybe.

503
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,835
Besides, dude, $62 won't get us far.

504
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,610
Yeah.

505
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,944
Ahhh.

506
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,852
Check this out.

507
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,394
Did you know that missionaries
aren't allowed to date?

508
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,163
Wow, that's a shocker.

509
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,132
Absolutely no contact
with members of the opposite sex.

510
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,792
Neat.
Turn out the lights.

511
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,197
One of us has to read mission rules
in this companionship,

512
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,274
so you need to relax.

513
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,037
Flirting or dating is not tolerated.

514
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,806
You are not to telephone, write to,

515
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,941
or accept calls or letters
from anyone of the opposite sex

516
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,144
living within
or near mission boundaries.

517
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,915
You check that out;
that's serious.

518
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:53,053
We're, uh, Senator, we're 140 miles
from the nearest town.

519
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,632
Yes, sir. I told you
I would personally find them,

520
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,100
and I will, Senator.

521
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,967
Good night, sir.

522
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,741
We didn't get very far.

523
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,275
It would have been nice for one of us
to remember water before taking off.

524
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,681
Well, the coffee can was a good idea.

525
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:19,589
We'll see ya in the morning.

526
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:24,151
Why'd you come on a mission,
Elder Johnson?

527
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,127
Prospects for marriage
are far greater

528
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,859
for returned missionaries,

529
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,197
and it was the right thing to do.

530
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,597
What about you?

531
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,172
Girlfriend.

532
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,174
Wow, she must be pretty special.

533
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,471
Ooooh yeah, real special.

534
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,036
She was fetchin' engaged
six weeks after I left...

535
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,875
Bummer!

536
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,542
to my brother.

537
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,458
Sorry. That hurts!

538
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,889
That hurts even worse!

539
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,769
It was like, my parents,
they were so excited about it.

540
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,270
They were?
How could they be?

541
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,568
Well, my brother is like 42.

542
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,410
They thought it'd get him
to move out.

543
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,842
He still lived at home?

544
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,846
Well, we shared a room.

545
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:39,230
C'mon baby... you can do it,
honey, ol' Blossom.

546
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:45,708
Rise and shine, Elders,
takin' the active runway.

547
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,141
Come on!

548
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:53,848
Weeeee! Ah ha ha hahaa!
Whew!

549
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,758
ORDER UP!

550
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,629
French toast, two short stacks,
over easy.

551
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,027
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:07,995
How you holdin' up?

553
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,590
Oh, I'm as good as gold, darlin'.

554
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,363
Sorry it took so long, Elders.

555
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,565
There you go.
Anything else?

556
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,068
Uh, yeah, coffee, black.

557
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,542
Very funny.

558
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,545
This place is like a cash cow.

559
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,444
Are you always this busy?

560
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,643
Yes, and it usually runs
a little smoother.

561
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,777
You can smell the money
over the grease.

562
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,253
Then you should hire more help.

563
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,290
My mom handled crowds
for 20 years

564
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,018
without missing an order.

565
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,426
People waiting on their food.
Get a goin' now.

566
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,863
I better go.
Can't upset the cook!

567
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,070
Wow!
She looks a lot different.

568
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,844
You are so clueless, man.

569
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,776
What?
What did I do?

570
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,745
It's what you didn't do, man.

571
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,012
When a girl gives you an
opening that big, you take it!

572
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,485
What?
When?

573
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,112
Like the whole mom thing.

574
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:09,455
You shoulda been like,
"Your mom must be pretty special.

575
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,118
When can I meet her?"

576
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,755
That's not somethin' I'd ever say.

577
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,363
Oh, and what would you say, Romeo?

578
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,068
I'd ask her why her mom
wasn't here helpin' out?

579
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,160
Wrong.

580
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,638
What if she's sick
with some terrible disease?

581
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:27,006
Then she'd tell me she is sick
with some terrible disease.

582
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,636
Yeah, and then you say,
"I'm so sorry."

583
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,874
And then she'd know
how sensitive I am.

584
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,508
Then she'll start crying,
rushing to the back room.

585
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,779
Nice job, Johnson.

586
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,878
Why are we having this conversation?

587
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,456
We can't date!

588
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,184
OJ?

589
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,196
Is that a Coca-Cola product?

590
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,289
It's Minute Maid.

591
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,767
I'm tryin' to help Elder Johnson
keep his words of wisdom,

592
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,360
and I'm afraid it is.

593
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:56,836
What?

594
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,101
We'll have to pass.

595
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,540
Thank you!

596
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,803
Where're you from, Elder?

597
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,315
Uh, I'm uh, I'm from the South.

598
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,519
Oh yeah?
What part of the South?

599
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,985
California.

600
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,089
I grew up in the South,

601
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,095
and we never heard about California
bein' part of it.

602
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,165
Well, there's two parts
to California...

603
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,996
one is the North,
and one is the South.

604
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,661
And I'm from the South.

605
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,343
Should I be takin' notes, Romeo?

606
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,121
Our ride's here.

607
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,885
Those are the clowns
I hustled at the pool hall.

608
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,796
Can we please have it to go,
please?

609
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,869
Yeah, we were supposed to meet
the pastor ten minutes ago.

610
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,607
Here you go.
Sorry you're late.

611
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,062
Elders, wait.

612
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,227
Come on, I'll give you a ride
to Bishop Hollister's place.

613
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,894
No, that's okay, we can walk.

614
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:34,972
Don't be ridiculous.

615
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,904
It'll take you two hours
to get there walking.

616
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,339
Get in.

617
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,417
Is that guy a friend of yours?

618
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,286
What guy?

619
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,324
Daren?

620
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,894
How did you know his name?

621
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,963
I, uh, overheard the waitress.

622
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,027
Oh, so he's your boyfriend.

623
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,162
Daren Burnett is the biggest jerk
in three counties.

624
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,603
We grew up together.

625
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,199
He wouldn't stop asking me out,
so I went out with him.

626
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,677
He is unstable,
and I learned

627
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,011
I wanted more out of life
than football and beer parties.

628
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,610
So, that's where you found Jesus?

629
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,758
You know, you guys aren't like
typical missionaries.

630
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,122
You think this has traces
of coffee in it?

631
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,426
Even if there is,

632
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,524
the ox is in the mire,
wouldn't you say?

633
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,660
Oh yeah, sure.

634
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,671
I once I pretended to be sick
on Super Bowl Sunday

635
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,934
so my mom would take me
to the doctor's

636
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,533
so I could watch the game
in the waiting room.

637
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,579
She said,
"The ox was in the mire."

638
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,643
I still feel really bad about that.

639
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,584
That story makes no sense, Elder.

640
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,819
But I know what you mean.

641
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,571
I waited at your place
for more than an hour.

642
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,764
I am sorry, Bishop.

643
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,773
We completely lost track of time.

644
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,773
Where you been?

645
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,341
It was my fault, sir.

646
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:25,575
I was, I wanted to stop
at the diner.

647
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,776
I am sure Sarah is thankful
for the business,

648
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:33,517
but Sister Cooley
needed a blessing.

649
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:38,288
She is having a baby next week,
and she's not doing well.

650
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,387
It won't happen again, sir.

651
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:47,301
Elders, good missionaries
have dedication and commitment.

652
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,135
And this town needs
good missionaries.

653
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,404
Well, what would you like
us to do, Bishop?

654
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,242
Why don't you go back to town;
do some tracting?

655
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,910
Go where the spirit leads you, Elders.

656
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,721
Uh, right, that good ol'
spirit leadin' the way!

657
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,787
Say, Sarah, can we catch
a ride back to, uh, town.

658
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,623
Yeah.

659
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,754
Wrong spirit, Elder.

660
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,359
It is no big deal, Bishop.
I don't mind.

661
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,459
Elder Talbot, what is the rule
on riding in cars

662
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,037
with single sisters?

663
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,106
Are you talking
about attractive sisters

664
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,266
or unattractive sisters, Bishop?

665
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,376
We are not allowed to ride
in cars with single sisters.

666
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:36,385
I am sorry, Bishop,
I guess I didn't think about it.

667
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,381
It doesn't look too good
when two missionaries

668
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,323
are riding around
with a very attractive sister.

669
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,125
You guys know the way back?

670
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,328
We'll be fine.

671
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,577
All right, never enter a home
of a single sister.

672
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,945
When the father
is away from the home...

673
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,951
Man, tell me what we can do.

674
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,683
This place is worse than the camp.

675
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,988
Well at least we could drink a Coke,

676
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,462
or have a cup of Joe
and ride in cars with girls.

677
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,033
There were no girls
at our school.

678
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,569
Back up, back up, back up!

679
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,797
Back up!

680
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,298
Back up, back up!

681
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,536
Back up!

682
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,975
Aaaaahhhh!

683
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,746
Okay. Okay.

684
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,976
All right.
Enough. Enough.

685
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,519
Six miles in under two hours.

686
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,953
Not bad.
Throwing lemons too.

687
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,557
You know, you can learn a lot
about a town

688
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,391
just by walkin' its roads.

689
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,264
Yeah, we saw lots of lemons.

690
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,494
Ha ha.

691
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,162
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

692
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,467
What about that tracting
you wanted us to do?

693
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,065
We'll get to that later.
Come on, get in.

694
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,548
Well, here we are.

695
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,218
Did you ride horses
when you were a kid?

696
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,693
Yeah, once.

697
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,593
That wasn't a horse;
that was a mule.

698
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,562
Fellas, come on in.

699
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,031
You've never ridden a horse?

700
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,262
Dude, how many black cowboys
have you seen?

701
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,532
Elders, I'd like you to meet
my good friend,

702
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,436
Reginald Steedman.

703
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,937
That's the first.

704
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,606
You guys ready for some work?

705
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,683
Work?

706
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,376
As in "work"

707
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,717
or are we talkin'
about the Lord's work?

708
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,218
Brother Steedman
and I have made a deal.

709
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,660
Every time you
clean out his stalls,

710
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,358
he'll listen to one
of the discussions.

711
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,866
That seemed pretty fair.

712
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,203
How many discussions are there?

713
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,507
You don't even want to know that.

714
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:27,281
Elders, I've never seen cleaner stalls.

715
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,325
Eight o'clock tonight.

716
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,689
What's at 8 o'clock?

717
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:34,253
You cleaned my stalls,
I'll let you teach me a lesson.

718
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,528
Great.
Eight o'clock.

719
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,466
That's less than two hours.

720
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,055
Okay, Elders, go ahead.

721
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,420
We had a deal.

722
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,585
Yeah, go ahead,
Elder Johnson.

723
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:08,529
It's your lesson.

724
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,463
Help a brother out.

725
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,433
Okay, just pick one of those lessons.

726
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,834
He's not going to know if it is right.

727
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,285
Uh, your body is a temple.

728
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,789
Yes, it's a very big temple.

729
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,417
No, no unclean thing
should be partaken of

730
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,428
to defile our body.

731
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,861
The Lord revealed to Jordan Smith

732
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,526
that we should refrain
from strong drink,

733
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,604
tobacco, and out-of-date meat.

734
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,833
Don't you mean Joseph Smith?

735
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,135
Exactly!

736
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,767
He always gets it wrong.

737
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,642
And, and, if you obey
these wise words of wisdom,

738
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:02,845
ye shall walk and not faint,
run and not fall down.

739
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:07,583
Isn't it, out-of-season meat?

740
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,785
Yes, but, uh,
it can be interpreted to mean

741
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,590
past the expiration date

742
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,665
shown on the packages
of the meats.

743
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,066
Yeah, what does strong drink mean?

744
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,233
Well, um, let's, let's, let's see.

745
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,211
Well?

746
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,612
Strong drinks:

747
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,412
"Not for the belly
but for washing of our bodies.

748
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,818
"And again, tobacco
is not good for man

749
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,323
"and is an herb for bruises
and sick cattle

750
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,417
to be used with judgment and skill."

751
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,723
Where does that come from?

752
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,459
Well, it says revelation given
to Joseph Smith, the prophet,

753
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,938
at Kirtland, Ohio,
February 27, 1833.

754
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,235
That's almost 200 years ago.

755
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,242
That's pretty forward thinking.

756
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,446
Uh, yeah, J. Smith
was no dummy, you know.

757
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,914
"Please help us.
We're heading west.

758
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,145
Elders Johnson and Talbot."

759
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,558
So, Elder Johnson, successful day?

760
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,363
Yeah, we uh, we did some preachin',
if that's whatcha mean.

761
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,941
Have you always been
a member of the church?

762
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,844
No. Why?

763
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,477
'Cuz you do some
of the strangest things.

764
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,711
Like ordering Coke
when I shouldn't have?

765
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,285
I have just noticed
there are things you do,

766
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,882
aren't typical
of the missionaries I've known.

767
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,393
Well, considering
where I've been in my life,

768
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,021
I think that I'm doin'
pretty good as a missionary.

769
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,601
Okay, that came out wrong.

770
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,728
I'm not judging you.

771
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,866
I just find it nice.

772
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,239
Nice?

773
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,508
Yeah, nice that you're different.

774
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,448
Do you realize
if my last name was Elder,

775
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,782
I'd be "Elder Elder."

776
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,551
And if I was a woman
I'd be "Sister Elder."

777
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,084
That's confusing, isn't it?

778
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,889
What is it with you
and bathrooms?

779
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,226
Every time you come out
you're like a genius.

780
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,357
But if I had an older sister
in the same mission,

781
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,561
you'd say,
"Sarah, this is Elder Elder,

782
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,504
"and this is Elder Elder's
eldest sister, Sister Elder.

783
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:14,668
Elder Elder, Sister Elder,
this is Sarah."

784
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,871
That's kinda cool, isn't it?

785
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,973
Why don't you be the dumb waitress
and leave the deep thinking to us?

786
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,382
Elder Elder.

787
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,511
Elder Elder, Sister Elder.

788
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,418
What was that supposed to mean?

789
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,547
What?

790
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,319
The "dumb waitress" bit?

791
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:36,693
I don't know,
I've met some pretty dumb waitresses

792
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,529
on the outside that is,

793
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,103
but, not you, of course.

794
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,197
My mom was a waitress
her entire life.

795
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,771
And I am sure she's probably
a very special person.

796
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,513
When can I meet her?

797
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:55,811
She is dead.

798
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:02,855
Sarah, wait...
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

799
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,394
Why don't you concentrate on being
the insensitive missionary,

800
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,930
and I'll concentrate
on being the dumb waitress.

801
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,265
Nice timing.

802
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,744
We gotta get outta here
before I go crazy.

803
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,509
Elders, I need your help.

804
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,812
Someone else have some stalls
that need cleanin'?

805
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,853
It's Brother Steedman.

806
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,785
There's been an accident.

807
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,558
He was unconscious
when they found him.

808
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,526
I don't understand.

809
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,892
We were just with him.

810
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,466
The first thing he said
when he woke up

811
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,001
was he wanted
to see the missionaries.

812
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,503
Now, do you have consecrated
oil with you?

813
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,436
What?

814
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,475
Consecrated oil,
that's why we're here.

815
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,477
I'd like to give
Brother Steedman a blessing.

816
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,941
No, we don't, Bishop.

817
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,879
We must have left it
in the car.

818
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,974
Well, I have some in my truck.

819
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,316
Uh, you two go inside.

820
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,314
A blessing?

821
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,187
Do you know what he is talking about?

822
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,761
Yes, and there is no way we can
bluff our way through it.

823
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,128
Brother Steedman.

824
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,600
Elders!

825
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,637
Well, I'm very glad you came.

826
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,871
What happened?

827
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,599
Well, I don't really know.

828
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,109
I was on the fence;

829
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,874
the next thing I remember
I was staring at the clouds.

830
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,818
So, what did the doctor say?

831
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,217
Well, they are doin'
a whole bunch of tests--

832
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,482
nothing so far.

833
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,023
Okay, that's a good thing then.

834
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,490
You know, I had a dream.

835
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,358
I saw some things that made
me think about you two.

836
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,390
It kinda scared me.

837
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,194
If it's that whole
out-of-date meat thing,

838
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,064
you know, we can review that whole...

839
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:58,369
Ever since I met you two,
something's a little, well...

840
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,171
Maybe some, you know,
some reading material...

841
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,473
will uh, help you clear your mind?

842
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,707
Ha ha, huh.

843
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:10,253
You two did a great job
taking care of my horses.

844
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,482
Please take care of my place
until I get back home.

845
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,218
Now, I know
it's a big responsibility,

846
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,523
but I am sure you two
can handle the job.

847
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,619
Tomorrow's feed day,

848
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,131
so you're gonna have
to take my truck

849
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,430
and go into town
and load up for the week.

850
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,936
No, but I'm afraid that
that is not gonna work.

851
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,939
Bishop Hollister's set up
a lot of appointments,

852
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,872
and we are sorta committed.

853
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,342
Well, I've already spoken to him.

854
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,881
He said he could work things out
as long as it's okay with you.

855
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,518
We'll do it.

856
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,347
I knew I could count on you two.

857
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,657
How are you?

858
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,354
I'm doin' okay.

859
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,590
You guys are going to have
to excuse me.

860
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,996
Uh, I have the consecrated oil.
What about the blessing?

861
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,731
Excuse me, I have to be
with my companion.

862
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,931
I'm sorry about that.

863
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,903
Look, you can't leave me here.

864
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,842
We're a team, remember?

865
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,280
Look, Elder.
Tyler...

866
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,248
We got wheels, we got cash,

867
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,252
and agreed to leave
when we had both.

868
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,517
So don't give me the guilt trip.

869
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,284
Are you comin' or not, huh?

870
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,725
We are supposed to stay together.
It's mission rules.

871
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,663
We're not missionaries!

872
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:35,670
We're delinquents, serial #43769.

873
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:38,502
Look, I think we are
somewhere in between.

874
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,099
The only reason why anybody
gives us attention

875
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:44,112
is because they think
that we are missionaries.

876
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,910
If they knew who we were,
they'd run us outta town.

877
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,485
Look, I just think it's time
we stopped running, Justin.

878
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,683
Hey, running's my life.

879
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,828
Why?

880
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,625
Well, let's see.

881
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,530
It started when my dad
didn't show up

882
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,329
to my championship
baseball game.

883
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,869
Yeah, I was seven.

884
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,268
According to my counselor,

885
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,466
I'm in desperate need
of some attention.

886
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:15,636
So, I run. I have to.
It's who I am.

887
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,578
It's not who you are;
it's what you do.

888
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,475
Blah, blah, blah.

889
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,384
What am I supposed to say?

890
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:27,685
Tell them that I got sick.
I had to go home.

891
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,884
The last missionaries up and left.

892
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,483
So, why can't we?

893
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,231
What am I supposed to tell Sarah?

894
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,659
No, don't do this man.

895
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,610
The children of Israel
wandered in the desert for 40 years

896
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,741
before they found
the promised land.

897
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,521
Is that supposed to motivate me?

898
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,590
Nah, it's just a little trivia is all.

899
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,960
Well, the tallest donut ever
was like over 30-foot high

900
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,157
and weighed almost 600 lbs.

901
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:12,235
It took ten guys
three days to eat it

902
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,065
Do you know that
because you were one of the ten?

903
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,233
Shouldn't we have
stayed at the rest stop?

904
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,775
Absolutely not.

905
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:24,404
This is going to make great material
for my homecoming talk.

906
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:36,187
Assuming we live.

907
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,961
Elder Johnson,

908
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,430
Yeah?

909
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,737
...if I die, you can eat me!

910
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,407
No thanks.

911
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,205
I hit my cholesterol max
with the Twinkies.

912
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,711
No, come on, really.

913
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,145
My parents would totally understand.

914
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,218
No. No, um, I'm uh, a vegetarian.

915
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,719
Good, the wolf will eat me then.

916
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:09,724
I realize we had burgers yesterday,
but as of right now I am a vegetarian.

917
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,817
Okay, that's cool.

918
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,522
Elder Johnson?

919
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,584
Is something wrong?

920
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,489
Where's Elder Talbot?

921
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,234
He is, uh, in the truck.
He's asleep.

922
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,064
That's the Steedman's truck.

923
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,040
Yeah, yeah, he, uh,
he asked us

924
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,042
to take care of his place
while he was in the hospital.

925
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,270
Well, what happened?

926
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,006
The doctors aren't sure.

927
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,577
They said not to worry.

928
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,379
I didn't want to bother you,

929
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:13,115
so I was just-I was just gonna
leave this note on your jeep.

930
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,751
What's it say?

931
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,160
Just that um,
we'll be at the Steedman place

932
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:26,133
if you need to get ahold of us.

933
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,966
It's a little weird seeing you
in normal clothes.

934
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,666
Yeah. Heh.

935
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,709
If feels kinda weird too.

936
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,472
It feels too much like home.

937
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:45,444
Listen, I'm sorry
about what I said earlier.

938
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,580
You mean about me
being a dumb waitress?

939
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,784
I didn't say that you were dumb.

940
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,123
We get it all the time.

941
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,821
People see the uniform,

942
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,867
but they don't see who's inside.

943
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,496
I guess waitresses and missionaries
have got a lot in common then.

944
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,540
Yeah, I guess we do.

945
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,740
So, do you like it here
in New Harmony?

946
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,339
What's not to like?

947
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,015
Everybody knows everybody.

948
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,522
It's quiet most of the time.

949
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:27,530
We're one big, big family.

950
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:28,893
Not a day goes by

951
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,729
that I don't think
about going someplace else.

952
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,104
There's a whole world out there

953
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,299
I know nothing about.

954
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:42,708
Yeah, well, most of it
isn't worth knowing.

955
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:46,543
I guess you see both sides
from being a missionary.

956
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,312
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I do.

957
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:58,153
And I kinda like what
I see here in New Harmony.

958
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,728
Right.

959
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,993
Well, I uh,--I better go.

960
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,001
You know,
that whole opposite sex thing.

961
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,198
Elder Johnson?

962
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,676
Yeah?

963
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,246
Good night.

964
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,053
Good night.

965
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:40,294
Beautiful Sunday morning,
and it's great to be alive!

966
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,497
Ha ha, ha ha!

967
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,006
Need some help?

968
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,558
Huh?

969
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,161
It was the girl, wasn't it?

970
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:12,029
No! Not even.

971
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,194
Yeah, right.

972
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,467
Not EVEN!
I came back to save you!

973
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:18,802
Yeah, right.

974
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,511
Remember the Donner Party?

975
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,604
Wrong season, Elder.

976
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:30,414
You must survive at all costs
to carry on my legacy.

977
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,284
I'm not eating you, Elder Talbot.

978
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,793
"And if you labor all your days
and save but one soul,

979
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,125
how great shall be your joy
in my Father's kingdom."

980
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,295
I'm still not eating you.

981
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,900
Ha ha ha ha!
Don't start without me, Bishop.

982
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,968
Brothers and sisters,

983
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,839
we've had a wonderful
meeting here today.

984
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,036
And in closing,

985
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,105
I'd like to invite Elder Talbot
and Elder Johnson,

986
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,275
our new missionaries,
to come up here

987
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,946
and introduce themselves to you
and to bear their testimonies.

988
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,850
Elders?

989
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,825
This oughta be interesting.

990
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,880
Good morning,
brothers and sisters.

991
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:50,456
Good morning, I'm Elder Johnson,
and my partner, Elder Talbot.

992
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,436
We are here straight from the MTC,

993
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,029
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

994
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:02,908
# Amazing grace #

995
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:07,449
But, it, it's good to be here,
in New Harmony.

996
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,415
# ...how sweet #

997
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,645
I'm from California,

998
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:15,053
and my companion
is from a small town in Idaho.

999
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,921
...where the nation vacations.

1000
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,386
This is the Lord's work.

1001
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,127
You saints of New Harmony
are awesome.

1002
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,601
# swwweeeettt #

1003
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,002
Uh, yeah, we're still,
we're still workin' on that.

1004
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,400
Absolutely.

1005
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,113
Can I get an amen?

1006
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,618
Amen.

1007
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,584
Can I get an amen?

1008
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,886
Amen!

1009
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,623
Amen.

1010
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,433
# There are people
on this street #

1011
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,874
# Who give us
somethin' to eat #

1012
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,411
# Hey ya, hey ya #

1013
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:11,502
# They could use some company #

1014
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,104
# Have a laugh
or shoot the breeze #

1015
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,877
# Hey ya, hey ya #

1016
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,611
# And do you ever stop
to stare #

1017
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,913
# Or take the time to care? #

1018
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,114
# Hey ya, hey ya #

1019
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,714
# And what about
the lonely man next door #

1020
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,225
# Do you think he is tired
of bein' bored? #

1021
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,260
# Come on,
come on #

1022
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:31,026
# So many people
are reaching out #

1023
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:36,663
# Looking for brighter days #

1024
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,207
# When you help
someone in need #

1025
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,743
# Get them back up
on their feet #

1026
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,278
# Take a brother by the hand #

1027
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,848
# He'll become a friend #

1028
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,384
# Then there's a circle
without end #

1029
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,976
# Turning strangers
into friends #

1030
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,522
# With every kindness
you are blessed #

1031
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:57,957
# Brings you real happiness #

1032
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,189
# The circle of love,

1033
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:06,667
# Comes back to you
the more you give it #

1034
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,760
# Love ##

1035
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:19,881
Oh dude, if I have to eat
one more scoop of mashed potatoes.

1036
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,851
Today was the longest day
of my life.

1037
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,227
Well, aside from my stomachache,
I thought it felt pretty good.

1038
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,124
Definitely worth a journal entry,
ya know?

1039
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,732
What are you doin'?

1040
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,201
I'm writin' in my journal.

1041
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,309
But it's not even your journal.

1042
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,382
Why don't you worry
about going to sleep,

1043
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,883
and I'll worry about writing
in my journal, okay?

1044
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:10,261
That's it.
It's over.

1045
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,234
So much for my legacy.

1046
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:20,307
They've come for us!

1047
01:01:21,513 --> 01:01:23,743
You boys like a drink of water?

1048
01:01:24,016 --> 01:01:25,347
You got any yoohoo?

1049
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:27,749
Milk?
Some skim milk?

1050
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,718
Who are you guys anyway?

1051
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:34,418
- We're missionaries.
- From the booklet...

1052
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:38,823
Do you know the purpose of life?
'Cuz I do.

1053
01:01:39,732 --> 01:01:41,290
I definitely do.

1054
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:46,960
Sorry to put you boys out,
but we're on official business.

1055
01:01:47,072 --> 01:01:48,630
Thanks for the ride.

1056
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:52,108
Call the number on this card.
They'll send you a free video.

1057
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:55,172
Let me know if you find out
the meaning of life.

1058
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:56,839
Oh, but, we, we have!

1059
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:58,007
That is... the point.

1060
01:01:58,117 --> 01:01:59,607
It's in the book.

1061
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:00,776
I tried to tell...

1062
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:01,818
Okay. Bye.

1063
01:02:01,921 --> 01:02:03,786
Ah... civilization.

1064
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:05,015
So dramatic.

1065
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:07,820
You make it sound like
we were gone for a month.

1066
01:02:07,927 --> 01:02:09,792
I'm starving.
Let's find a restaurant.

1067
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:11,294
We still got some Twinkies.

1068
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:15,098
Come on, delicious, tasty,
golden, delicious...

1069
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,599
Okay, you're gonna
make me vomit.

1070
01:02:16,702 --> 01:02:19,603
...and it's got the filling
with the creaminess.

1071
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:21,798
Come on, one Twinkie?

1072
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:31,242
He is pretty cute.

1073
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,783
In fact, they both are.

1074
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:35,012
They are missionaries.

1075
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:37,782
I've seen the way
you've been lookin' at him.

1076
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,221
Don't be ridiculous.

1077
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,859
What would you do
if he wasn't a missionary?

1078
01:02:46,365 --> 01:02:48,390
I'm not playin' your little game.

1079
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:54,733
So, when are you going
to start dating again?

1080
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,502
You know, I know four priests
who'd go out with you.

1081
01:02:57,609 --> 01:02:59,270
Stop this.

1082
01:02:59,378 --> 01:03:02,006
What?
It's true.

1083
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:05,277
Come on, let me set you up
so you can have fun.

1084
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:07,545
I'm not having
this conversation.

1085
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:10,451
So, how many priests
are in this town?

1086
01:03:10,556 --> 01:03:13,389
About 15, but only 5 are active.

1087
01:03:13,492 --> 01:03:17,656
Eighteen teachers
and 21 deacons.

1088
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:19,321
You're allowed to date priests?

1089
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,524
They can date priests
but not deacons.

1090
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:24,568
Teachers aren't supposed to,
but some do.

1091
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,400
Ick, teachers are so immature.

1092
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:32,136
Not as bad as some
of the elders I know.

1093
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:34,109
I think I'm getting a headache.

1094
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:36,181
With only one week
to election day,

1095
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:38,841
polls are suggesting that
Senator Boxwell is a shoe-in.

1096
01:03:38,951 --> 01:03:40,578
The man can do no wrong.

1097
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:41,516
It's come down...

1098
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,315
Will you turn that up?

1099
01:03:43,422 --> 01:03:47,290
You guys aren't supposed
to watch TV.

1100
01:03:47,393 --> 01:03:49,054
Senator, what do you attribute

1101
01:03:49,161 --> 01:03:51,721
your last term's
incredible success to?

1102
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,320
Well, aside from hard work,

1103
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:57,198
I'd have to say a very loving
and supportive family.

1104
01:03:57,302 --> 01:03:59,429
Your daughters are adorable.

1105
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:01,802
It's nice to see
such a strong family man

1106
01:04:01,907 --> 01:04:04,273
representing our great state.

1107
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:05,468
Thank you very much.

1108
01:04:05,577 --> 01:04:08,045
And regardless of what happens
next week, Christine,

1109
01:04:08,147 --> 01:04:11,310
I know I'll always have
a loving and supportive family.

1110
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,009
There you have it Bob,
Roy Boxwell,

1111
01:04:13,118 --> 01:04:15,086
a great senator and a great...

1112
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,520
You all right, man?

1113
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,712
Yeah, can I get Roy Boxwell,
please?

1114
01:04:45,017 --> 01:04:46,678
This is Justin.

1115
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:48,747
Look, he knows who I am.

1116
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,858
Yes, well put him through.

1117
01:04:57,696 --> 01:04:59,095
Justin, where are you?

1118
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:02,565
I am in the middle of the desert,
right where you sent me.

1119
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:03,965
What do you want... money?

1120
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:07,368
I don't need your money.

1121
01:05:07,473 --> 01:05:09,100
Then what?

1122
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:12,439
I saw your little TV interview today.

1123
01:05:12,544 --> 01:05:14,978
You're quite the family man
these days.

1124
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,412
Justin, tell me where you
are so we can talk.

1125
01:05:17,516 --> 01:05:19,313
Nice try, Senator.

1126
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:21,545
Justin, let me send someone for you.

1127
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:23,245
You wanna send someone to get me?

1128
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:24,947
Yes, I do.

1129
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:26,752
Let me have your pen.

1130
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,653
See you around, Roy.

1131
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:33,162
Justin!
Justin!

1132
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:38,331
What?

1133
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:41,838
Look, I'm on the last week
of my reelection campaign,

1134
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,601
don't screw this up.

1135
01:05:56,655 --> 01:05:59,055
What was that all about?

1136
01:06:06,865 --> 01:06:07,593
Hello?

1137
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:09,599
Yes, is Justin there?

1138
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:11,726
No, nobody named Justin.

1139
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:15,068
Tell me, where is this phone located?

1140
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:17,642
It's a pay phone inside
the New Harmony Diner.

1141
01:06:17,743 --> 01:06:18,869
New Harmony?

1142
01:06:18,977 --> 01:06:20,171
Who is this?

1143
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:22,509
All right, thank you very much.

1144
01:06:22,614 --> 01:06:25,105
Get General Wilkins
on the phone for me.

1145
01:06:25,617 --> 01:06:26,914
How did you know?

1146
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:30,614
Half the camp knew you were
related to some politician.

1147
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:31,882
Now I know which one.

1148
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:36,723
Not a word, okay?
Please?

1149
01:06:36,828 --> 01:06:38,796
Why can't we get this in the open?

1150
01:06:38,897 --> 01:06:40,159
It's not a good idea.

1151
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:41,664
What's the worst that can happen?

1152
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:44,702
To him?
To him, probably nothin'!

1153
01:06:44,803 --> 01:06:47,363
He would claim he was helping
out some troubled kid

1154
01:06:47,472 --> 01:06:49,099
and walk away smelling like a rose.

1155
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,368
Then why'd you call him?

1156
01:06:50,475 --> 01:06:52,568
I couldn't just sit back

1157
01:06:52,678 --> 01:06:55,169
and let him get away with all
that family-man crap, okay?

1158
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,247
He's a liar.

1159
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,839
Face it, man!
Okay, your dad's a politician.

1160
01:06:58,951 --> 01:07:02,387
He is not the ideal family man,
but so what, who cares?

1161
01:07:02,487 --> 01:07:04,352
You got your own life, man!

1162
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:08,851
Justin, I mean that.
You got your own life, dude.

1163
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:11,589
So then let's go.

1164
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:14,461
It's you and me just like we planned.

1165
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:23,639
Actually, I'm sorta likin'
what's happening around here, man.

1166
01:07:23,742 --> 01:07:26,336
Huh... you, you mean
this missionary stuff?

1167
01:07:26,445 --> 01:07:27,707
Yeah.

1168
01:07:28,046 --> 01:07:29,206
Yeah!

1169
01:07:29,314 --> 01:07:33,876
I mean, it's not my style,
but I just like it-- it's fun.

1170
01:07:33,986 --> 01:07:35,681
I guess I just like helping people,

1171
01:07:35,787 --> 01:07:36,981
you know?

1172
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:38,716
Hey, you listen to me.

1173
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:40,485
The fuse is lit, all right?

1174
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:42,253
The real elders are coming.

1175
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:43,521
I know, I know.

1176
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:45,494
So let's go while we still can!

1177
01:07:45,597 --> 01:07:46,564
Come on!

1178
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:49,657
Something's just telling me
we shouldn't.

1179
01:07:49,768 --> 01:07:52,498
Ha, ha, it's the cafe food talking',
all right?

1180
01:07:52,604 --> 01:07:55,869
I can't deny the way I feel, man.

1181
01:07:55,974 --> 01:08:02,243
We cannot stay here forever,
okay, Elder Talbot?

1182
01:08:02,347 --> 01:08:05,009
We'll leave when the time is right.

1183
01:08:07,953 --> 01:08:10,080
I swear!

1184
01:08:10,188 --> 01:08:14,625
I swear on the Bible
and the Book of Mormon.

1185
01:08:14,726 --> 01:08:17,217
You're so stupid.

1186
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:18,660
Atta baby.

1187
01:08:20,365 --> 01:08:20,990
All right?

1188
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:22,066
It's not our money.

1189
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:23,759
Don't make me take it from you.

1190
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:26,463
Try to take it from me
and I'll put you down.

1191
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:27,663
I'm gonna count to three.

1192
01:08:27,773 --> 01:08:29,866
I'm warning you,
I am a trained martial artist.

1193
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:31,237
One.

1194
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,777
Two.

1195
01:08:39,084 --> 01:08:41,052
Two and a half.

1196
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:44,145
All right buddy, snake eyes, okay?

1197
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:46,121
Watch out for him, he's everywhere.

1198
01:08:46,224 --> 01:08:46,781
Ow.

1199
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:47,916
Give it to me.

1200
01:08:48,727 --> 01:08:49,386
Right now.

1201
01:08:49,494 --> 01:08:53,521
Oh, man.
That really stings.

1202
01:08:53,632 --> 01:08:58,126
All right girls,
with the backpack you've got a deal.

1203
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:01,000
Hey, I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid
from a seat that small.

1204
01:09:01,707 --> 01:09:04,301
They're going to be great;
the baskets are very nice.

1205
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:07,003
And check this out...

1206
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:09,444
Would you just hush up.

1207
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:10,446
Bubbles!

1208
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:12,517
Ahh, you know their names.
Perfect.

1209
01:09:12,617 --> 01:09:14,915
Yeah, but I'm not telling you
the other two.

1210
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:15,952
So, ha!

1211
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:23,553
Gentlemen, what are you thinking?

1212
01:09:23,662 --> 01:09:26,187
I mean you just leave the keys
in the ignition?

1213
01:09:26,298 --> 01:09:27,788
It's not real safe.

1214
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:29,958
You never know
who's gonna pick 'em up.

1215
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:34,505
I suppose you're not going
to give us back our keys?

1216
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:40,210
Uh... no.

1217
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:49,979
What's this all about?

1218
01:09:50,088 --> 01:09:52,579
This is about who stays
and who goes.

1219
01:09:52,924 --> 01:09:53,948
Oh, I get it.

1220
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:56,391
This town isn't big enough
for both of us.

1221
01:09:56,495 --> 01:09:58,588
Showdown at the lemonade corral,
huh?

1222
01:09:58,697 --> 01:10:01,962
Come on, Daren, let's do this.

1223
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:04,058
You boys get
two minutes' head start.

1224
01:10:04,169 --> 01:10:05,966
Last man without paint wins.

1225
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:07,095
Wins what?

1226
01:10:07,205 --> 01:10:09,400
We win... you got ten minutes
to pack your stuff.

1227
01:10:09,508 --> 01:10:10,805
You're gonna run us outta town?

1228
01:10:10,909 --> 01:10:12,137
Yep... just like we did

1229
01:10:12,244 --> 01:10:14,940
with the last two dork missionaries.

1230
01:10:15,046 --> 01:10:18,447
If we win, we get our keys back.

1231
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:19,983
We stay, and all you boys

1232
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:23,213
have to attend church
for the next six months.

1233
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,156
Come on, Daren,
let's get on with it.

1234
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:30,490
Two minutes starts-- now.

1235
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:32,962
Stay.

1236
01:10:33,064 --> 01:10:35,498
Elder Johnson,
spirit's telling me to move,

1237
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,897
let's move, so let's move.

1238
01:10:37,002 --> 01:10:38,594
I ain't runnin' anymore.

1239
01:10:38,703 --> 01:10:40,466
What are you doin', man?

1240
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:45,042
Elder Johnson,
what would Jesus do, okay?

1241
01:10:45,143 --> 01:10:45,632
Let's go.

1242
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:46,802
Jesus?

1243
01:10:46,912 --> 01:10:49,472
Jesus wouldn't run
from a bunch of rednecks.

1244
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:50,548
Heh.

1245
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:52,879
Looks like these Bible boys
know how to play.

1246
01:10:54,019 --> 01:10:55,782
I've gotta work in a half hour.

1247
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:57,855
Shut up, Dale.

1248
01:10:57,956 --> 01:10:59,856
Just me and you, huh,
preacher boy?

1249
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:00,856
You first.

1250
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:03,427
I'll take the rest of your crew, huh?

1251
01:11:06,298 --> 01:11:08,596
Come on, man,
you gotta make this interesting.

1252
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,861
Come on, let's just go.
Let's just go.

1253
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:56,946
I guess I'll see you boys
at church on Sunday.

1254
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:12,553
# Sometimes you gotta take
one step back #

1255
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:16,498
# To go two steps
forward #

1256
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:19,570
# Sometimes you gotta
stop believing #

1257
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:22,834
# And find the faith #

1258
01:12:22,941 --> 01:12:26,104
# What's done is done #

1259
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:29,510
# Tomorrow has just begun... #

1260
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:33,573
Hey, check this out.

1261
01:12:33,685 --> 01:12:35,243
Are you pushing me
off the road?

1262
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:37,253
Hands up, come on.

1263
01:12:37,355 --> 01:12:40,153
Hey, nice day for a ride,
huh guys?

1264
01:12:40,258 --> 01:12:41,555
What the fetch!

1265
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,491
Those are the guys
who stole our car!

1266
01:12:43,595 --> 01:12:44,527
Catch 'em.

1267
01:12:44,629 --> 01:12:46,290
Come on.
Pump.

1268
01:12:46,398 --> 01:12:47,126
Pump!

1269
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:48,062
I'm tryin'.

1270
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:49,190
You're on my wheel.

1271
01:12:49,301 --> 01:12:50,199
Lance Armstrong!

1272
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:52,497
I can't do it, Elder.
I'm walking.

1273
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:06,575
Elders, what's going on?

1274
01:13:08,253 --> 01:13:09,083
You know what, Bishop?

1275
01:13:09,187 --> 01:13:10,085
We just saw the...

1276
01:13:10,188 --> 01:13:11,621
Burnett Brothers.

1277
01:13:11,856 --> 01:13:13,824
Listen, I have a surprise
for you two.

1278
01:13:13,925 --> 01:13:16,257
Can you get yourselves
cleaned up?

1279
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:19,160
We are sort of in a hurry.

1280
01:13:19,264 --> 01:13:23,166
Yeah, our laundry smells
really bad, sir.

1281
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:24,394
Please.

1282
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:26,732
It's only going to take
a couple of minutes.

1283
01:13:31,076 --> 01:13:32,509
Come on.

1284
01:13:46,091 --> 01:13:48,082
THREE BOGIES!

1285
01:13:48,193 --> 01:13:49,387
Hey, Bishop.

1286
01:13:49,494 --> 01:13:50,620
Hello, Sarah, how are you?

1287
01:13:50,729 --> 01:13:51,718
Good.
Hey, Elder.

1288
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:53,127
Hey, Sarah.

1289
01:13:53,231 --> 01:13:55,495
Elders, come on over.

1290
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,568
Oh, hey, you're out!

1291
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:59,432
They couldn't find a thing.

1292
01:13:59,537 --> 01:14:00,629
Ha ha!

1293
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:03,765
So, here I am.
I hate hospital food.

1294
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,433
Looks like you're making up for it.

1295
01:14:05,944 --> 01:14:07,741
Please, sit down.

1296
01:14:10,515 --> 01:14:13,609
Elders, I know that things
have been kinda crazy

1297
01:14:13,718 --> 01:14:15,549
these past few days.

1298
01:14:15,654 --> 01:14:17,087
Yeah, they have.

1299
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:21,454
I'm thinking about getting baptized.

1300
01:14:23,094 --> 01:14:26,120
Less than three days
and already you have a convert.

1301
01:14:27,265 --> 01:14:30,029
Are you sure we're not
rushing things a little bit?

1302
01:14:31,269 --> 01:14:32,759
What do you mean, Elder?

1303
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:37,768
How do you know Brother Steedman
is thinking clearly?

1304
01:14:37,876 --> 01:14:39,571
He just got out of the hospital.

1305
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,009
Reggie?

1306
01:14:41,112 --> 01:14:47,642
Well, I know it sounds crazy,
but, um, this feels right.

1307
01:14:50,388 --> 01:14:53,050
You Elders know what
that's like, don't you?

1308
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:56,621
Yes, we do.

1309
01:14:56,728 --> 01:14:59,788
And I'd like you to be the one
to baptize me, Elder Johnson.

1310
01:15:01,132 --> 01:15:02,463
Me?

1311
01:15:03,702 --> 01:15:05,829
Would you do me the honor?

1312
01:15:12,077 --> 01:15:14,409
Can both of you excuse us
for a minute,

1313
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:19,711
while I speak to Elder Johnson,
I mean Elder Talbot, in private?

1314
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:26,589
Hey you!
Not so fast!

1315
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:31,987
I know who you are.

1316
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,656
What's going on?

1317
01:15:33,765 --> 01:15:36,029
We played pool together
two nights ago.

1318
01:15:37,335 --> 01:15:39,200
You must have me confused
with someone else.

1319
01:15:39,304 --> 01:15:40,236
I don't think so.

1320
01:15:40,338 --> 01:15:42,863
Daren, leave him alone.

1321
01:15:43,174 --> 01:15:45,836
He wore a cowboy hat, sunglasses.

1322
01:15:45,944 --> 01:15:48,572
Said he was passing through town
like a bad burrito?

1323
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,011
There is obviously some mistake.

1324
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:51,480
Missionaries don't play pool.

1325
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,244
He ordered beer.

1326
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:55,410
Yeah, well, missionaries
don't drink either.

1327
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,748
You did.

1328
01:15:56,855 --> 01:15:58,220
You're a liar.

1329
01:15:58,323 --> 01:15:59,517
Shut up, Sarah.

1330
01:15:59,624 --> 01:16:03,287
Easy pal, or I'm going to be
introducing you to the ground.

1331
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:04,326
Daren, stop!

1332
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:05,987
So, shut up!

1333
01:16:07,265 --> 01:16:09,096
Back off, cowboy, all right?

1334
01:16:11,703 --> 01:16:12,897
Daren, stop it!

1335
01:16:13,004 --> 01:16:17,737
Easy boys, let's end this now.

1336
01:16:17,842 --> 01:16:21,369
I never forget a face,
especially an ugly one.

1337
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:23,504
His name is Elder Johnson,
all right?

1338
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,309
Look, we are missionaries, okay?

1339
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,115
We don't want any trouble.

1340
01:16:31,222 --> 01:16:32,883
It's okay, Tyler.

1341
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:35,255
You know, you're right.

1342
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,619
I did play pool with you
the other night,

1343
01:16:39,731 --> 01:16:41,756
and I cleaned you out.

1344
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:43,532
I told you.

1345
01:16:43,735 --> 01:16:44,793
See, I knew it!

1346
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:47,594
He's been lying
to all of us.

1347
01:16:47,705 --> 01:16:49,468
He's a hustler.

1348
01:16:55,914 --> 01:16:59,907
My name is Tyler,
and we're not missionaries.

1349
01:17:02,387 --> 01:17:05,982
We are from a correctional camp
in the Mojave Desert.

1350
01:17:06,991 --> 01:17:08,117
The pickup we stole

1351
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:10,990
broke down in the middle
of the desert.

1352
01:17:11,095 --> 01:17:13,928
So, we grabbed the first car
that came along.

1353
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,094
I'm sorry.

1354
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:19,193
I allowed you into my home.

1355
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:23,233
I trusted you.

1356
01:17:27,745 --> 01:17:29,804
Is this true?

1357
01:17:34,385 --> 01:17:36,444
Yeah.

1358
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,587
Shame on you.

1359
01:17:46,197 --> 01:17:48,097
- Sarah.
- Don't.

1360
01:17:53,338 --> 01:17:54,635
Senator.

1361
01:17:56,941 --> 01:17:58,135
I'm Bishop Hollister.

1362
01:17:58,243 --> 01:17:59,175
Bishop, it's a pleasure.

1363
01:17:59,277 --> 01:18:01,142
What are you doin' here?

1364
01:18:01,246 --> 01:18:02,838
I've come to get you, Justin.

1365
01:18:02,947 --> 01:18:05,006
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1366
01:18:05,116 --> 01:18:05,912
Justin.

1367
01:18:06,017 --> 01:18:07,917
Wait.

1368
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:09,486
I'll take over from here, Senator.

1369
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:11,714
Oh, it's all right, General.

1370
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:14,121
I had a long talk
with Bishop Hollister here.

1371
01:18:14,225 --> 01:18:16,625
He's told me everything
that has been going on, Justin.

1372
01:18:19,597 --> 01:18:20,996
You know, in all the years

1373
01:18:21,099 --> 01:18:23,829
of military schools
and outreach programs,

1374
01:18:23,935 --> 01:18:26,631
I've never had such praise
for my son.

1375
01:18:33,544 --> 01:18:39,210
Did he mention car thief,
impostor, liar?

1376
01:18:40,385 --> 01:18:44,082
Like father, like son.
Right, Dad?

1377
01:18:44,188 --> 01:18:48,318
You lie to your people,
and I lie to mine.

1378
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:49,415
Give him a chance.

1379
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:50,994
He had his chance.

1380
01:18:52,463 --> 01:18:53,691
We're done.

1381
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:55,732
Look, Justin,

1382
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,427
come back with me, please?

1383
01:18:58,536 --> 01:19:00,504
We'll start over, I promise you.

1384
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:02,869
Ah, that's nice.

1385
01:19:02,974 --> 01:19:07,536
Senator Boxwell welcomes back
his prodigal son.

1386
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:09,408
That'll make quite the headline.

1387
01:19:09,514 --> 01:19:11,675
This isn't about headlines,
and you know that.

1388
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:13,375
This is about you and me.

1389
01:19:14,886 --> 01:19:18,583
You're about 15 years late...
Dad.

1390
01:19:20,992 --> 01:19:24,223
It's better late than never.

1391
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:27,355
I'd give a million dollars
to meet my father.

1392
01:19:33,438 --> 01:19:36,737
Hey, everybody,
we're the new missionaries!

1393
01:19:44,949 --> 01:19:47,042
What's your name, Elder?

1394
01:19:47,552 --> 01:19:49,918
- I'm Elder Talbot.
- And I'm Elder Johnson.

1395
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:53,548
Sorry it took us so long,
but these flippin'...

1396
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,425
These fetchin'...

1397
01:19:56,561 --> 01:19:58,153
We sorta got sidetracked.

1398
01:19:59,464 --> 01:20:02,524
I feel we already know you, Elders.

1399
01:20:03,401 --> 01:20:05,198
You guys look hungry.

1400
01:20:05,737 --> 01:20:06,863
Told you I lost weight.

1401
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:08,996
It just didn't look like it to me.

1402
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:14,474
Hey, that is a really nice tie!

1403
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:16,046
Oh, thank you.

1404
01:20:16,147 --> 01:20:17,808
Does this belong to you?

1405
01:20:23,021 --> 01:20:25,455
Thank you, Elder Talbot.

1406
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:31,493
And, uh, this belongs to you.

1407
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,768
I'm sorry.

1408
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:42,972
Uh, my name is Tyler,

1409
01:20:44,075 --> 01:20:47,704
and most people know me
as "Elder Talbot."

1410
01:21:02,427 --> 01:21:05,021
All right.
Get in the pipe!

1411
01:21:19,577 --> 01:21:27,279
# Who wants to go,
who wants to go to heaven? #

1412
01:21:27,385 --> 01:21:32,982
# Who needs to ask
or reason why? #

1413
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,717
Come on!
Move it!

1414
01:21:35,827 --> 01:21:39,957
# Who wants to go,
who wants to go to heaven? ##

1415
01:21:41,332 --> 01:21:43,323
Remember the first time
we came here together?

1416
01:21:43,434 --> 01:21:45,231
Yeah, I do.

1417
01:21:45,336 --> 01:21:47,201
Almost two years ago.

1418
01:21:47,638 --> 01:21:49,196
Has it been that long?

1419
01:21:53,344 --> 01:21:55,938
Just a little somethin'
from all of us at the diner.

1420
01:22:02,887 --> 01:22:05,151
These are my travel books
from years ago.

1421
01:22:05,256 --> 01:22:06,484
You broke into my house?

1422
01:22:06,591 --> 01:22:09,560
Hello! I have a key!
Open it up.

1423
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:13,562
# Who wants to go,
who wants to go to heaven? #

1424
01:22:13,664 --> 01:22:21,332
# Who needs to ask
or reason why? #

1425
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:22,872
# Who wants to burn... ##

1426
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:24,202
I can't accept this.

1427
01:22:24,308 --> 01:22:26,469
Well, it's not transferable
and nonrefundable.

1428
01:22:26,577 --> 01:22:27,407
Danielle!

1429
01:22:27,512 --> 01:22:29,173
Sarah!

1430
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,407
You gotta stop thinkin'
about everyone else for once,

1431
01:22:31,516 --> 01:22:34,314
especially what's his name.

1432
01:22:34,418 --> 01:22:37,512
It would mean a lot
to all of us if you went.

1433
01:22:41,559 --> 01:22:43,789
I'm going to New York City.

1434
01:22:43,895 --> 01:22:45,260
It's pretty cool, huh?

1435
01:22:45,363 --> 01:22:51,097
# ...A chance to die,
to be reborn #

1436
01:22:53,104 --> 01:23:00,840
# With just one kiss...
just one kiss... #

1437
01:23:00,945 --> 01:23:06,941
# With just one kiss
and you're mine #

1438
01:23:07,051 --> 01:23:09,884
# Hold on #

1439
01:23:09,987 --> 01:23:11,648
Put 'em up.

1440
01:23:15,993 --> 01:23:18,860
Now, fill it back up.

1441
01:23:20,031 --> 01:23:27,460
# I lay my dream
down before you #

1442
01:23:27,572 --> 01:23:35,240
# A splendid tapestry,
it's so old #

1443
01:23:35,346 --> 01:23:42,980
# But tread so carefully,
for there is danger #

1444
01:23:43,087 --> 01:23:51,119
# You might just trample
on my dream #

1445
01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:58,533
# To never,
ever be forgiven #

1446
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:06,634
# To never,
ever wonder why #

1447
01:24:06,744 --> 01:24:10,305
# With just one kiss #

1448
01:24:10,414 --> 01:24:14,407
# A feat such as this #

1449
01:24:14,518 --> 01:24:19,353
# With just one
and you're mine ##

1450
01:24:20,091 --> 01:24:22,889
Steal water?
You earn a day in the pipe.

1451
01:24:22,994 --> 01:24:24,461
Any questions?

1452
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:25,756
Speak up, son.

1453
01:24:25,863 --> 01:24:28,127
My um, my cousin told me

1454
01:24:28,232 --> 01:24:30,029
that two boys
died this past summer.

1455
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:34,332
Earlier today we had 12 graduates,
a real success.

1456
01:24:34,438 --> 01:24:36,497
He said their eyes
were plucked out by vultures,

1457
01:24:36,607 --> 01:24:39,098
and their skin
was dried out like leather.

1458
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:42,976
Well, let's just stick to the
mission at hand, shall we?

1459
01:24:43,581 --> 01:24:45,242
All right.

1460
01:24:47,852 --> 01:24:49,251
Can I come in?

1461
01:24:49,353 --> 01:24:51,048
You already did.

1462
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,380
So, congratulations, man!

1463
01:24:54,492 --> 01:24:55,789
We did it!
We're done.

1464
01:24:55,893 --> 01:24:56,518
This is it.

1465
01:24:56,627 --> 01:24:58,185
Yeah, you too.

1466
01:24:58,296 --> 01:24:59,126
You all packed?

1467
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,221
Uh, gettin' there.

1468
01:25:01,332 --> 01:25:06,861
So, have you heard from her?

1469
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:08,336
No.

1470
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,502
It's no big deal.

1471
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:13,770
Huh... liar.

1472
01:25:13,878 --> 01:25:15,072
- No!
- Okay.

1473
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:16,043
I'm okay.

1474
01:25:16,147 --> 01:25:17,045
Okay, ha ha.

1475
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:19,013
I'm just gonna work
all summer... and...

1476
01:25:19,116 --> 01:25:21,050
forget all about her.

1477
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,249
Sure.

1478
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:27,888
What about you?

1479
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:30,085
I haven't picked
a school yet.

1480
01:25:31,395 --> 01:25:34,626
Guess I'll wait and see where
the wind blows me, ya know?

1481
01:25:37,234 --> 01:25:39,498
Man, I'm so done with this place.

1482
01:25:41,972 --> 01:25:43,769
Yeah.

1483
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:55,351
You're gonna be all right, man?

1484
01:25:55,453 --> 01:25:57,216
Elder.

1485
01:26:06,497 --> 01:26:11,264
I'm going to see
the Riveter, hoo hooo!

1486
01:26:11,369 --> 01:26:13,462
Yaaaa hahaha!

1487
01:26:13,571 --> 01:26:15,766
Wheee!

1488
01:26:22,313 --> 01:26:24,747
Okay, man, this is your space.

1489
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:27,943
Don't you take
no crap from nobody!

1490
01:26:28,052 --> 01:26:29,280
Okay.

1491
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,478
ORDER UP!

1492
01:26:38,596 --> 01:26:41,064
You are gettin' pretty fast
back there.

1493
01:26:41,799 --> 01:26:43,630
Bring it on, baby.

1494
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,731
If you don't get back to work!

1495
01:26:45,836 --> 01:26:47,599
You see me awful busy in here.

1496
01:27:29,947 --> 01:27:34,611
I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

1497
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:39,854
I'm Sarah,
and I own the diner in town.

1498
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:46,962
I'm Justin.

1499
01:27:47,064 --> 01:27:53,628
I, uh, shovel... stuff,
all day long.

1500
01:27:54,972 --> 01:27:57,839
I understand
you give riding lessons.

1501
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:01,002
Oh, Brother Steedman
gives the lessons.

1502
01:28:01,111 --> 01:28:04,512
I just sort of
make him look good.

1503
01:28:05,349 --> 01:28:07,579
Is he around?

1504
01:28:07,685 --> 01:28:11,280
No, he uh, he won't be back
until tomorrow.

1505
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:19,251
Come here, I have something
I want to show you.

1506
01:28:19,363 --> 01:28:20,921
Look, Sarah,

1507
01:28:26,203 --> 01:28:28,364
I came back
to make things right.

1508
01:28:29,507 --> 01:28:31,771
And I don't expect
anything from you.

1509
01:28:36,413 --> 01:28:38,381
I know.

1510
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:44,352
You, uh, might want to watch
where you're steppin'.

1511
01:28:51,695 --> 01:28:53,754
I'm glad you came back.

1512
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,064
Now, come on!

1513
01:29:01,705 --> 01:29:04,333
I figured if you're
gonna be around awhile,

1514
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:07,171
you oughta be properly introduced
to New Harmony.

1515
01:29:07,278 --> 01:29:10,543
Well, it puts a new perspective
on things, doesn't it?

1516
01:29:10,648 --> 01:29:11,615
It really does.

1517
01:29:11,715 --> 01:29:13,307
How about a barrel roll?

1518
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:14,714
Wooohooo!

1519
01:29:14,818 --> 01:29:15,546
Whoa!

1520
01:29:15,653 --> 01:29:17,780
Load the barrel...
hahahahaha!

1521
01:29:17,888 --> 01:29:19,150
Whoa.

1522
01:29:19,256 --> 01:29:19,915
Help!

1523
01:29:20,024 --> 01:29:20,752
Sister Cutbank, stop!

1524
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:22,052
Look what you're doing.

1525
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,184
You two ever been to Australia?

1526
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:26,422
No, Sister Cutbank, we haven't.

1527
01:29:27,998 --> 01:29:31,399
Why don't we just go
down under right now,

1528
01:29:31,502 --> 01:29:33,436
just the three of us?

1529
01:29:33,537 --> 01:29:37,337
It can't be more than
a couple of thousand miles.

1530
01:29:37,441 --> 01:29:39,306
We're a little low on fuel.

1531
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:42,072
Ah, good point.

1532
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:45,478
Get ahold of your stomach,
it's goin' into your butt!

1533
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:49,346
Wooo!

1534
01:29:49,453 --> 01:29:51,250
Sister Cutbank!

1535
01:29:51,589 --> 01:29:52,988
I'm gonna be sick.

1536
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,216
Sister Cutbank!

1537
01:29:54,325 --> 01:29:56,452
Hey, what's that boy?

1538
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,084
He's turning a little green.

1539
01:29:58,195 --> 01:29:58,889
No!

1540
01:29:58,996 --> 01:30:01,487
Ha ha ha ha!

1541
01:30:02,633 --> 01:30:05,534
I'm finished.
I'm done, Sister Cutbank.

1542
01:30:05,636 --> 01:30:06,762
No more, please!

1543
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:09,100
Ha hah haa!

1544
01:30:11,809 --> 01:30:13,606
Ahhhhh!
We oughta do this again!

1545
01:30:13,744 --> 01:30:15,507
(Love bites!)
