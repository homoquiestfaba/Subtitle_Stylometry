00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,674
I'm about to give
it to you right now.

342
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,175
You know what I want?
What you want?

343
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,377
I want that kaboom.

344
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,113
Girl, you're
trying to crawl down...

345
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,382
You want the hammer?
I want the hammer.

346
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,117
Then go get the hammer.

347
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,285
Okay.
Enough of that nastiness.

348
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,152
Oh, my God!
(SCREAMS)

349
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,588
Babe, call 911! Now!

350
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,657
Get out of my house,
you son of a bitch!

351
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,659
(GROANS)

352
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,628
JAMES: I can't believe
this shit.

353
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,997
Angela, what if I
was a real intruder?

354
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,066
Instead of my brother
creeping around my house?

355
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,567
Wasn't nobody creeping.

356
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,103
You were sitting in the dark
with a coke and a hot dog.

357
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,705
If you'd lock the door
or close the window

358
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,607
or bar that patio
like I told you.

359
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,944
This is exactly
why I didn't let you
install the alarm system.

360
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,112
It's about who's
going to protect you.
This weenie?

361
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,281
One, he is not a weenie!
(JAMES SCOFFS)

362
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,083
He can be weenie-ish,

363
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,119
weenie-like,
but I love him,
so it doesn't matter.

364
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,056
I picture you with somebody
with a little more prestige.

365
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,624
Somebody who plays
for the Falcons

366
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,025
or the Braves,
or even the Hawks.

367
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,327
Braves. Yeah.

368
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,728
Not with the mascot.

369
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,463
James, listen to me,

370
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,998
you do not screw this up for me.

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,566
BEN: Hey, guys.

372
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,402
I can hear what you're saying.
So if you want to stop.

373
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,603
Damn, it's Sir Scream-a-Lot.

374
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,975
I was responding to
a hostile situation, James.

375
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,411
You call for backup
when there's
a hostile situation.

376
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,646
That wasn't calling for backup.

377
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,581
That was
a high-pitched scream,

378
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,249
and you pushed
my sister in the way.

379
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,452
I pushed your sister
out of harm's way.

380
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,354
You shined the light at us.

381
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,356
It's different strokes
for different folks.

382
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,624
Put the ice pack in
his mouth. No, on his head.

383
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:37,328
I'm sensitive to
extreme measures of cold
and you know that.

384
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,132
Because you just got
knocked out by yourself.

385
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,255
James, you know what? You...

386
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,773
Um...

387
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,041
Guys, maybe we should...

388
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,476
What?

389
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,081
Is he still staring?
Make him stop.

390
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,384
Look. We were in
the middle of something,
so you have to go.

391
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,551
Y'all wasn't in
the middle of nothing.

392
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,353
We were, James.

393
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,322
Let's go. Get out.
I got my sandwich over here.

394
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:08,026
Listen. Listen, I'm going.
Bar that patio door.

395
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,428
ANGELA: I will. Thank you.
Promise. Love you.

396
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,465
Hey, James, wait up.

397
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,467
Hey, can you wait up, please?

398
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,069
Hey.

399
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,572
Look, man...

400
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,674
I know that you
don't really like me,

401
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,676
but I feel like
you don't like me
because you don't know me.

402
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,079
Nope, you're wrong.
I don't like you
because I do know you.

403
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,548
Well, I bet you'll like this.

404
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,252
I got accepted into
the police academy today.

405
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,788
I'm going to be a cop.
I've been trying
to call you all day.

406
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,357
I'm finally going
to have a career that
I can be proud of, man,

407
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,693
and Angela can be
proud of, and you.

408
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,729
Who knows,
maybe we can be partners
or something.

409
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,731
(SPITS)

410
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,800
Okay.

411
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,835
Now that I got things
straight, I feel like

412
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,271
I can finally make your sister
an honest woman.

413
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,473
There's just one thing
standing in the way.

414
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,676
I was wondering if I
could get your blessing
to ask Angela to marry me.

415
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,752
BEN: James?

416
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,589
Did you hear what I said?

417
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,791
I have to go.

418
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,226
Yeah, okay.

419
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,195
I figured that you
probably just got to

420
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,397
let everything sink in,
which is fine.

421
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,166
Maybe we could
take a ride later
and talk about all this?

422
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,407
Oh, shit.

423
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,809
So, just because
you joined the academy,

424
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,845
that suddenly makes
you ready to propose?

425
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,882
Yes. I mean, no!

426
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,550
I've been ready.

427
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,420
Look, I figured
that if I made it
through the academy

428
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,688
that you would be
forced to accept me.

429
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,889
Is that right?

430
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,493
I don't want to be
known as the guy
who set you on fire.

431
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,194
In my defense,
that was a mistake.

432
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,663
I tried to put you out.
I got water, but you panicked.

433
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,232
I don't even want
to dig into that.

434
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,900
That's getting off subject.
I want to talk to you...

435
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,869
Show and prove.

436
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,671
Show and what?
What are you...

437
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,907
You want to marry my sister?

438
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,809
Show me you're worthy of her.

439
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,412
And prove to me
you got what it takes.

440
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,549
How do you want me to
do that? I don't get it.

441
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,153
Tomorrow,
I'm going to take
you on a ride-along.

442
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,255
You can show me
what kind of man
you're made of.

443
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,524
And prove to me

444
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:23,427
that you deserve somebody
as special as Angela.

445
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,896
Hell, yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

446
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,398
Thank you, man.

447
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,771
I cannot wait to
show you that I'm twice
the man that you think I am.

448
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,541
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

449
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,342
All right. I'll see you then.

450
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,179
It's time to let go.

451
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,315
Hey, this is going to be great.

452
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,184
You will not regret this.

453
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,497
Mmm...

454
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,665
(SNIFFS)

455
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,233
Morning.

456
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,367
(GASPS)

457
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,835
James!

458
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,906
Didn't I tell you to
bar that patio door?

459
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,609
What are you doing, man?
It's 6:00 in the morning.

460
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,811
Good cops wake up
before the crooks.

461
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,346
Get your ass up. Let's go.

462
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,849
Okay.

463
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,954
James, that's not cool!

464
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,722
All right.

465
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,557
I'm ready, man.

466
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,292
Boom.

467
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,462
You forgetting something?

468
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,964
Uh-uh. Forgetting what?

469
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,901
This could be the last time
Angela sees your
little ass alive.

470
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,063
Don't you want to say goodbye?

471
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,671
No.

472
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,973
You can get shot today.

473
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,409
You know that, right?

474
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,345
Dead. You.

475
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,017
Ang?

476
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,652
Hey, babe?

477
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,322
Listen, James just
told me I could die.

478
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,324
ANGELA: No,
you're not going to die.

479
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,493
If I do die, I want you
to know that I love you.

480
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:06,264
If this was a latte,
it would be a love latte.

481
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,333
And you make me
think of rainbows,
because we both love colors.

482
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:15,506
And I love the way
your hands open up and
close, like monkey paws.

483
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,675
Remember when we ate
that peanut butter?

484
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,910
You was like,
"Put it on your nose,"
and I was like, "No."

485
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,479
That's the day
I fell in love with you.

486
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,880
Give me a kiss.

487
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,415
I want five of 'em in a row.
Five?

488
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,778
BOTH: Mwah! Mwah!
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

489
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,951
BEN: Deal. Done.

490
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,919
ANGELA: Go, go, go.

491
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,756
Hey. I hope I don't die,
because I still got
a lot more to say,

492
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,924
and I know we got to go, so...

493
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,829
All right, let's go.
Kick move.

494
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,998
You didn't tell me
you had a car like this!

495
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,868
What's under the hood?
A 5.7 liter Hemi?

496
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,370
Look at these tires!
Those are 22-inch Z Pirellis.

497
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:52,043
Are you driving it
with the traction control
or the posi... Okay. Okay.

498
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,120
I need a minute with you.
Where's your team?

499
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,788
I got them
sitting on a location.

500
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,856
Who's this?

501
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,391
Benjamin Barber.
Prospective.

502
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,625
Prospective what?

503
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,394
I'm a pre-cadet
at the academy.

504
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,795
I didn't realize
that was a category.

505
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,565
No, I got him from
that Boys & Girls Club.

506
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,900
I'm starting to do
some mentoring and shit.

507
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,936
I'm just surprised
you let anybody in
the car with you.

508
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,704
I'm starting to
take your advice.

509
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,806
Letting people into my life.

510
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,909
I may actually
become the new smiley face

Hey, Lieutenant...

854
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,650
I think it would have
worked out a lot better
if I had a gun.

855
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,685
So, you need a gun to
interrogate children?

856
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,723
Me having a gun just gives me
a certain level of confidence.

857
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,425
Knowing that
it's below my belt.
That's all I'm saying, man.

858
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,361
Have you ever even
held a gun before?

859
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,864
The PX-48R controller
is extremely realistic.
Okay?

860
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,399
(LAUGHING)

861
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,600
What are you laughing at?

862
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,568
Are you talking
about a video game?

863
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,936
Yes.

864
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:15,572
Don't mention
those stupid video
games to me, okay?

865
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,307
Don't say stupid.
Don't call my games stupid.

866
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,911
In my world, do you know
what you would be considered?

867
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:22,712
A newbie.
A newbie?

868
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,315
A newbie.
You have any idea
what level player I am?

869
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,383
No.

870
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,918
You have no idea.

871
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,687
My gamer tag is
spoken in hushed terms
of awe and envy.

872
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,489
When I log on, people go crazy.

873
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,392
"Oh, my God!
Black Hammer's in!
(WHISPERS) Black Hammer."

874
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,459
Shit's not real.

875
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,328
You would be lost in my world.

876
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,630
Black Hammer would not help you.

877
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,967
Let me show you my world,
all right? The real deal.

878
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,607
BEN: Why don't we just
go to the department range?

879
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:53,643
Because that's for cops only.
Which you are not.

880
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,645
Yet. Which I'm not yet.

881
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,314
Hey, James.
Hey, Val, how you doing?

882
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,548
Good. How's it going?

883
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,517
Pretty fair for a square.

884
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,285
Got to train a new booty today.

885
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,987
I'm new booty?

886
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,323
I'm Val.
How you doing?
I'm Ben. New booty.

887
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:08,258
Good to see you, Ben.
You, too.

888
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,893
They got everything
you need here.
Right. Right.

889
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,761
But this the real deal.
Mmm-hmm.

890
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,731
It's not a Xbox.
No video game controllers.

891
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,333
Just real deal.
Right.

892
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:19,336
Here's the handguns.
Val can hook you up.

893
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,571
Beretta, Glock, whatever.

894
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,007
I wish Assface was here.

895
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:26,443
Because he's more of
a suppression fire
disciple, you know?

896
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,578
I'm glad Assface is not here.

897
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,614
Why would you say that?
He should be here.
This is his world, too.

898
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:31,948
Uh...

899
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,316
I could choose whatever I want?

900
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,651
Knock yourself out.

901
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:38,488
All right. You said it.
No take-back-sies.

902
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,625
What do I want?
What do I want...

903
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,660
Hurry up.
You act like you're
looking for doughnuts.

904
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,762
Why are you so impatient?
I got shit to do.

905
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,930
Give me a second.
Let's go!

906
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,331
Fine, fine.

907
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,568
I want to get...

908
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,839
I don't want that one.
I want this one.

909
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:58,742
Smith and Wesson 500.
Let me get that.

910
00:37:58,744 --> 00:37:59,709
All right.
It's a good choice, ain't it?

911
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,011
500 Smith and Wesson.

912
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,879
You like that choice.

913
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,481
You like it.
Here you go.

914
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,715
Oh, ho, ho!

915
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,717
Bang, bang... Shit!

916
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,619
Problem?
Did you feel that?
No, no problem...

917
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,954
Got it?

918
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,323
Can I do that thing?
Like how they do that...

919
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,491
You know what?

920
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,759
Can you do it?

921
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:16,926
Let's just go with the Glock.

922
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,028
All right.

923
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,763
That's a good choice, boy.

924
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,531
Don't touch me.

925
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,732
That's a tap.
I didn't touch you.
There's a difference.

926
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,701
This is touching.
I didn't touch you.

927
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,802
There we go.

928
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,704
Hey, what's this? Shit!
Oh!

929
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,506
It's all right, I got it.

930
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,709
You want me to
help you set it up?
No, Ben I got it.

931
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,411
Should we get a book?
(GUNS FIRING)

932
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,584
Let's see what you got.

933
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,888
Do we need goggles
or earplugs or
anything like that?

934
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,091
No, usually the bad
guys don't give us time
to put on that kind of stuff.

935
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,627
Okay, right. That's
actually a good point.

936
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,629
It makes a lot of sense,
and it's better
to keep it real.

937
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,431
I would rather this be real.
You know what I mean?

938
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,933
Keep it real.
Yeah. Okay. (GRUNTS)

939
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,068
Here we go.

940
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,938
Freeze!
How do you say freeze?

941
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,607
Freeze.
Freeze.

942
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:10,113
Okay. You know what it is?
You don't move your
top lip that much.

943
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,649
I move my top lip
so it doesn't come out stern.

944
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,684
You get what I'm saying?
(IN DEEP VOICE) Freeze.

945
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,785
Freeze.

946
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,620
Just shoot.
Shoot.

947
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,122
Shoot.
Shoot.

948
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,591
You pronounce everything.
I got you.
You ready? Here we go.

949
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,927
Freeze! Atlanta PD!

950
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,062
Get on the ground!
Hands behind your head!

951
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,497
Fingers laced!

952
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,666
You better lace them!
Lace them!

953
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:30,934
Shoot the gun.
Okay. All right.

954
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,502
Ready? Here we go.

955
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,711
Damn it!

956
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,649
I pinched it. I pinched
the inside of my hand.

957
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,618
I don't think
the sight on the gun
is quite calibrated.

958
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,340
The way I was shooting,
it looks a little...

959
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,793
Yeah, it's off by
a centimeter or two.

960
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,965
You right-handed
or left-handed?

961
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:04,501
You were doing both.
You're ambidextrous.

962
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,036
That's why I like shotguns.
I'm more of
a shotgun specialist,

963
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,972
because I need
both of my hands,
because my upper body...

964
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,007
Let me use
your 12-gauge, man.

965
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,042
Be careful, it's got
a magnum loaded in it.

966
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,515
Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING)

967
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:21,785
Now we're talking.
The street sweeper.
Just like Fallujah.

968
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,019
Just like Fallujah.

969
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,521
My nigga.

970
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,123
Denzel, <i> Training Day.</i>

971
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,825
You might want to
step back a little bit.

972
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,694
This thing got
a little kick to it. Okay?

973
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:35,832
Freeze! You better stop
before I put
a hole in your back!

974
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,500
Oh, you think it's a game?

975
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,135
Oh, it's on now!

976
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,537
Oh, shit!

977
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,174
Got a little bit of kick to it.

978
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,844
My stomach in my ass.

979
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,013
Oh, yeah, you're
ready for the streets.

980
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,115
This gun should be banned.

981
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,654
I really appreciate everything.

982
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,756
No problem, man.

983
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:03,726
Well! How did it go?

984
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,962
BEN: (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
It was good.
It was real good.

985
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,964
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'm just a little rusty,
that's all, Val.

986
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,000
A little more used
to a higher-grade
military weapon

987
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,670
like an RPG or a flame thrower.

988
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,872
VAL: Yeah, we don't really
get the exotic stuff.

989
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:18,508
Though we did have
a couple of Zastavas
in here the other day.

990
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,876
Let's go.

991
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:20,844
Wait a minute,
you had some Zastavas?

992
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,979
Mmm-hmm.
M92 or the M93?

993
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,647
I had the M92.

994
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,982
Are you kidding me?
No.

995
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,517
I was going to ask you
about the Black Arrow.

996
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,652
That's what I thought
you was going to say.

997
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,221
We're talking about
the Serbian submachine guns.

998
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,189
The M92 is a good gun,
but that Black Arrow,

999
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,158
let me tell you something,
take your back off.

1000
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,260
Serbian?
Serbian, yes.

1001
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,062
How the hell you
know they were Serbian?

1002
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,565
Uh, because I'm the
Black Hammer. Platinum
level. I told you that.

1003
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,068
X-Y-C-Y.
You press at the same time
and it gives you a...

1004
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,570
Who had these guns?

1005
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:50,006
Two guys.
One white, one black.

1006
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,140
Serbian?

1007
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,510
Um, I don't know.

1008
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,878
One had an accent.

1009
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,113
Let's go.

1010
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,749
Serbians?

1011
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,885
One had an accent?
Yeah.

1012
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:04,254
If you could do it,
what would it be?
(SPEAKS ACCENTED GIBBERISH)

1013
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:05,555
What if you had the...

1014
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,689
(SPEAKS GIBBERISH)

1015
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,258
Let's go.
I'm trying to figure this...

1016
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,059
BOTH: Let's go.

1017
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,863
What was that about?

1018
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,265
Wait for me in the car.

1019
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,200
I just got a clue, didn't I?
In the car.

1020
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,103
I just figured something out.
I'm gonna get in the car.

1021

out here in these streets?

00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:12,474
To tote that
little civilian bastard
into an active crime scene?

1355
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,577
L-T, I did not know
it was going down
like this, all right.

1356
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:18,447
This owner right here
is always crying wolf.

1357
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:21,083
We come by to check it out,
it's going down.

1358
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:24,453
Perp gets shot,
no other fatalities.
What's the big deal?

1359
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:25,688
You want a medal for that?

1360
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,790
Now I hear you took
him to a gun range?

1361
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,025
And something
about military weapons
and Omar?

1362
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,461
That dry,
snitching-ass Santiago.

1363
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,764
It's not Santiago!
I got ears out
here just like you do.

1364
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,566
I told you to leave it alone.

1365
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,101
But you're out here on your own.

1366
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,603
I don't know half
the shit you're working.

1367
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:42,604
And all you say is "trust me"?

1368
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:43,739
You should.

1369
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,442
Haven't I earned that?

1370
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:48,610
Let me be clear.

1371
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,579
I can only cover
your ass so much.

1372
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,947
So clean your shit up.

1373
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,449
Or I'll clean it up for you.

1374
00:55:59,763 --> 00:56:00,923
You, get in the car, you done.

1375
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,624
Why?

1376
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,626
We got more important 126s?

1377
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:05,728
You almost got me killed!

1378
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,629
Almost don't count.

1379
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:08,731
So, you done. Let's go.

1380
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,566
No, I'm not done.

1381
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:12,101
I want to talk some more,
I got something else
I want to say.

1382
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:14,103
I may not be a cop right now,

1383
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:16,839
but I will be.
You hear me? I will be.

1384
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:20,008
And there is nothing
that you can do about that.

1385
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,077
I tried to help you.
Hey! Hey, man!

1386
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,514
You came to me and said,
give me a day to
show me what you got.

1387
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:26,915
I gave you a day.

1388
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,150
It's not good enough.

1389
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:31,487
So the answer to
your question is no!

1390
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,589
I do not give you my blessing.

1391
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,624
I don't need your blessing.

1392
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:39,628
This isn't Afghanistan.
I'm not about to
buy her with a goat.

1393
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,096
That girl loves me, man.

1394
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:44,633
That girl loves all of this.

1395
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:47,002
Breathe it in,
because it's in your face.

1396
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,771
I'm taking care of her, not you.

1397
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:49,938
You?
Me.

1398
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,641
You can't even
take care of yourself.

1399
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,643
You wouldn't last
one day out here.

1400
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,678
You think I'm
gonna become a cop
and get myself killed?

1401
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,780
Leave her by herself?

1402
00:56:57,782 --> 00:56:58,680
This conversation is over.

1403
00:56:58,682 --> 00:56:59,815
Get in the car.

1404
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:01,517
This is your problem, man.

1405
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,152
It's why you don't
have no damn partner.

1406
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,753
You walk around here by yourself

1407
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,188
because you don't trust nobody.

1408
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,457
Eventually
you're gonna have to
trust somebody, James.

1409
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:09,925
I'd never trust you.

1410
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,027
I'd never trust you
with my life.

1411
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,929
And my family's life?

1412
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,564
Can you comprehend that?

1413
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,032
You don't even know
why you don't like me.

1414
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,501
Tell me why!
You don't know why.

1415
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:20,869
Because you
don't know me, James.

1416
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,137
I know who you are.

1417

that's always trying

1418
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:26,208
to talk yourself out
of every situation.

1419
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,210
No matter how deep you in it.

1420
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:31,046
That's a bad character trait
for a cop.

1421
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:33,215
So get your ass in
the car so we can go.

Walk.

1425
00:57:38,189 --> 00:57:40,022
You think I've never
walked before? I'll walk.

1426
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,490
You think I'm gonna beg you?

1427
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,225
Don't beg me. I'll walk.

Can you at least let me ride
in the front seat, please?

1438

he'd risk coming back

01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:52,794
to give a special shout-out
to Miggs and Santiago.

1688
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:53,828
Hell, yeah.

1689
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:56,764
Yeah!

1690
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,333
I'm clapping, ain't I?

1691
01:08:58,335 --> 01:08:59,434
Am I clapping?

1692
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,371
Yeah!

1693
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:05,573
My double agents.

1694
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:07,842
You guys brought me
the best prize of them all.

1695

James Payton.

1696
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:11,579
What you think you doing...

1697
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:12,814
Shut your ass up, man!

1698
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,686
You don't have
the right to talk.

1699
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,325
See, James,
for those who don't know,

1700
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:28,429
James has been chasing
my ass day and night
for some time now.

1701
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:31,432
But he can never catch me.
You know why?

1702
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:33,468
Because he's one of those people

1703
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,503
who thinks he always knows best.

1704
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,839
Doesn't think that
people are good enough
for certain people,

1705
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,874
without even really knowing
those other people.

1706
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,343
You with me?

1707
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:46,581
Guess what today is, big man?
Today is the day that you die.

1708
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:48,349
Mmm-hmm.

1709
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,618
I'm going to have to
put some tarps down
and shit.

1710
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,587
Now I might finish
you off with my gun,

1711
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:54,489
I might.

1712
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:57,225
But I'm going to start you
off with the cold steel
of my katana blade.

1713
01:09:57,227 --> 01:09:59,761
I'm talking death
by a thousand cuts.

1714

I'd be entertained by that.

1718
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:07,769

Come on.

Don't you.

1724
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:21,883
I gotta cut you.
Don't you cut me.

a little more, cut him more.

I'm gonna cut you loose.

everybody in here
something right now.

It's about respect in this game!

that does not respect me.

something to you.
Omar is very comfortable.

You know why?

1770
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:43,592
Because Omar doesn't
have a bunch of guns
pointed at him,

that any of these idiots

actually believe this clown!

1776
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,872
Ask this guy right here
who he thinks Omar is.

I don't know, it just hurts.

you'd get the big picture.

01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,856
Oh, God!
Let's go!

1860
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,659
Same thing on
the count of three.

1861
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:40,928
Watch out!

1862
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,196
I just saved your life!

1863
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,066
Shit!
I just saved your life!

1864
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:46,367
Shit.

1865
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:47,335
Save my life and
get me the hell out of here!

1866
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,170
(SCREAMING)

1867
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,174
Yo, we can't go that way.

1868
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:54,642
Why?

1869
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,611
Because they got
AK-47s down there.

1870
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:59,146
Two shotguns.
They're probably Benellis.

1871
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:00,982
From the sound of it,
it might be AR-15 as well.

1872
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:02,049
You can hear all that?

1873
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,384
It's from the game.

1874
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:05,920
I got a perfect recall.
I'm a Platinum level player.

1875
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:08,322
Here you go! Huh?
See how you like that!

1876
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:10,024
Call me the perfect storm.
Grenade!

1877
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,328
You got five seconds
to pick it up
and throw it back.

1878
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,630
Oh!

1879
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,265
(MEN SCREAMING)

1880
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,840
Stop throwing
the goddamn grenades!

1881
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:27,675
I already pulled the pin.

1882
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:29,410
Another one!

1883
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,117
James, the money.

1884
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:37,480
JAMES: Ben!
Get your ass back here!

1885
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:42,256
It's gonna blow!
Let's get out of here!

1886
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,264
Oh!

1887
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,734
You all right?
I'm good.

1888
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:54,736
Okay.

1889
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,374
That's it?

1890
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:02,896
That's not so bad.
I thought it was going
to be bigger than that.

1891
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,461
Damn!

1892
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:21,729
My car!

1893
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,133
It's probably
still drivable though,

1894
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:27,375
because it happened in the back.

1895
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:34,775
You can't drive it now.

1896
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,711
Yeah, it's definitely not
drivable. At first it was,

1897
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:38,779
but after this, there's
no way you can drive it.

1898
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,183
We have to get out of here.
Come on.

1899
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:44,018
You wanna get a cab, or what?

1900
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,220
Let's go.
Okay. All right.

1901
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,456
BEN: So, what was
Omar going to do with
all those guns anyway?

1902
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:51,258
JAMES: Probably start an army
and take over the city.

1903
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,860
He's got half
the cops on his side.

1904
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:53,928
So, we stopped him?

1905
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:55,963
For now.

1906
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,231
Hey.
What?

1907
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,066
Slow down, man.

1908
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,835
You see I got the money, right?

1909
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:01,936
Yeah, that was good.

1910
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:03,838
Hold this. My sock is wet.

1911
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,941
Must have stepped in
a puddle or something.

1912
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:08,209
Hate it when that happen.

1913
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:10,144
(GASPS) What is that?

1914
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,515
JAMES: Damn. You shot.

1915
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:17,051
I think I would be able
to feel if I got shot.

1916
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:19,854
You got so much adrenaline
going through you,
you don't feel it.

1917
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:21,255
But I'm serious.

1918
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,823
JAMES: Wow.
BEN: What?

1919
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:23,825
It went straight through.

1920
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,927
Oh, my God!

1921
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,829
There's a hole in my leg!

1922
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:29,997
I got shot!

1923
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,165
Yeah I was pretty clear on that.

1924
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,868
Oh, shit! It hurts now!

1925
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,303
All right.
Sit yourself down. Sit down.

1926
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,139
I ain't gonna sit down!
I just got shot!

1927
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:40,174
I can't feel my toes!

1928
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:41,375
I can't feel my toes!

1929
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:43,377
Shh! Give me your belt.

1930
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,146
You gonna whip me
because I got shot?

1931
01:19:45,148 --> 01:19:47,381
Tourniquet!
Okay.

1932
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:50,417
You have to get a cold piece
of meat like a steak.

1933
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:52,186
You have to put
a steak on it, man.

1934
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:54,054
Listen!
I'm listening.

1935
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,056
I got shot!
You're gonna be okay.

1936
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:58,459
You lost a little blood.
Just have to get
you to a hospital.

1937
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,960
Anybody down here?
Calm down!

1938
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,029
All right, calm. I'm calm.

1939
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:03,632
(PHONE RINGING)
(CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO)

1940
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,266
(TURNS OFF)

1941
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,067
Yeah.

1942
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:09,303
Hey, Lieutenant,
we got a problem here.

1943
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,072
I'm aware. Make this
easy on us, James.
Come on in.

1944
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,307
<i>Wait,</i>
<i>what are you talking about?</i>

1945
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:16,877
Listen, Santiago
and Miggs, they dirty.

1946
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:19,880
(CHUCKLES) Funny,
they're saying the same
thing about you.

1947
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:21,849
<i>They got Marko and his buddy</i>
<i>backing them up.</i>

1948
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:23,150
What?

1949
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,218
Hey! Tell him I got shot.

1950
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:28,322
Lieutenant, you gotta
believe me, it didn't
go down like that.

1951
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,224
<i>You know I'm on your side.</i>
<i>Come in, James.</i>

1952
01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:32,560
Just don't make it any worse.
Where are you?

1953
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:35,029
BEN: My foot, I think
the tourniquet too tight.

1954
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:36,197
We already at worse.

1955
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,498
Is the ambulance coming?

1956
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,899
Is it coming?
No.

1957
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,402
And we can't call one either.

1958
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:43,237
They'll be all
over the scanners.

1959
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,405
What does that mean?

1960
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,208
It means I'm on my own.

1961
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,210
You're not on your own.

1962
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,377
You got me, man.

1963
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,882
Let's get you to a hospital.

1964
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,584
Okay. Oh, shit.

1965
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,023
Stop the car. Stop!

1966
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,362
Sorry to inform you, sir,
but I have to
confiscate your vehicle.

1967
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,897
That's not even a real badge.

1968
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:12,299
I'm a police officer,
I need you to get out.

1969
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:14,602
How you gonna
carjack me without a gun?

1970
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,538
You right. Get your ass out.

1971
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:21,108
Watch the sweater, man!
Watch the sweater, man!

1972
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,643
<i>Hold on to your weed!</i>

1973
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:25,479
<i>Firefighters are still</i>
<i>battling a nasty blaze</i>

1974
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:29,516

1975
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:30,885
Who cares?

1976
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,097
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

1977
01:21:43,952 --> 01:21:45,432
DOCTOR: Let's start
two bags of O neg.

1978
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:47,268
Let me know when
the next OR's available.

1979
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,136
James, take my hand.
Ain't happening.

1980
01:21:49,138 --> 01:21:50,905
James, please.

1981
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:52,973
Here, call Angela.

1982
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:54,642
Tell her I love her.
Tell her I love her so much.

1983
01:21:54,644 --> 01:21:55,976
She sent you a text.

1984
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,498
What she say? Read it to me.
It says...

1985
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:01,916
"Come home soon."

1986
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:02,918
"Come home soon"?

1987
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:04,585
Oh, my God!

1988
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,320
It's okay. Keep going.

1989
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:08,622
James, what if I
never see her again?

1990
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,624
Where's the doctor at?

1991
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:11,992
I'm right here.

1992
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:13,427
Doc, am I dying?
You're not dying.

1993
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,162
No, seriously.

1994
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:19,433
It's complicated.
I know you supposed
to call this in,

1995
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:23,470
Doc, I'm losing breath,
I think I need some CCs.

1996
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:25,372
I want you to buy me some time,

1997
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,142
so we can make sure
that the one that did this

1998
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:29,576
don't come back
and finish the job.

1999
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,246
You feel me?
Okay.

2000
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,515
Your buddy lost some blood,
so I'll give him
something for the pain.

2001
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:36,317
We'll get him in
the next OR that opens up.

2002
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:38,185
I appreciate it, Doc.

2003
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,454
Nurse, start him on
some morphine,
dress that wound,

2004
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,056
and let me know when
the next OR opens up.

2005
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:44,358
James, should we give him
some of the money we took?

2006
01:22:47,856 --> 01:22:49,296
I don't know what
he's talking about.

2007
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,631
You know what I'm
talking about. The money.

2008
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,633
We good here, Doc.
WWJD?

2009
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,301
Shut the fuck up!

2010
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:59,440
I found the entrance
to the prison door,
I'm taking heavy fire.

2011
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:01,342
Assface23, take out
that machine gunner.

2012
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:04,144
If you actually want to win,
you have to listen to me.

2013
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,713
<i>All right.</i>
This is not a game.

2014
01:23:05,715 --> 01:23:10,384
Shit! Someone lay
down suppressing fire.
I have to answer my door.

2015
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:11,618

ANGELA: Who is it?

2017
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:17,257
Angela, it's Santiago and Miggs.

2018
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:18,726
Can you do me a favor,
can you open up?

2019
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:21,362
I need to talk to
you for a second.

2020
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:22,696
What happened?
Is everything okay?

2021
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:24,098
How are you doing?
Good.

2022
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,032
Can we come in for a second?

2023
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:26,400
Sure. Sure.

2024
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:28,235
We're just looking for James
and your boyfriend.

2025
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:29,570
They're not here by
any chance, are they?

2026
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:31,739
No, I haven't
heard from James
or Ben in a while.

2027
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:33,540

01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:17,037
OMAR: Come on, James.

2201
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:18,505
Huh?

2202
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:19,806
Trust me.

2203
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,508
OMAR: Clock's ticking!

2204
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:22,510
What's it gonna be?

2205
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,080
All right. Whoa.

2206
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:28,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2207
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,017
Oh, now you want to
get some act right.

2208
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:32,786
I'm putting it down.

2209
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:34,228
Oh, now you're
putting it down, okay!

2210
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,195
Bye, James.

2211
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:46,766
BEN: Kick move.

2212
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,707
(GROANS)

2213
01:31:59,881 --> 01:32:00,881
How do you like that end?

2214
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:02,115
Damn.

2215
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:03,950
Game over, bitch.

2216
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:05,852
Oh...
He getting up.

2217
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,220
James...

2218
01:32:07,222 --> 01:32:08,922
James, you got him, right?

2219
01:32:08,924 --> 01:32:13,193
BEN: I didn't even
realize I got shot
till we left the warehouse.

2220
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,261
But I didn't panic, though.

2221
01:32:14,263 --> 01:32:15,303
Here comes the lieutenant.

2222
01:32:16,551 --> 01:32:17,831
So, now what are
you going to do?

2223
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:19,866
What you mean?

2224
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,636
Well, after three years
and all that overtime,
you finally got your man.

2225
01:32:22,638 --> 01:32:23,937
I didn't get my man.

2226
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:29,576
BROOKS: I never
liked those two.

2227
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:30,777
Hmm.

2228
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:33,780
What?

2229
01:32:33,782 --> 01:32:36,216
No, I'm not going to say it.
I'm not.

2230
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,184
No.
I'll see you at the office.

2231
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:41,988
Did you see that?

2232
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:43,657
Actually, I didn't.

2233
01:32:43,659 --> 01:32:44,891
You didn't see
the look that
he just gave me?

2234
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,993
No.
That was a look
of respect, James.

2235
01:32:46,995 --> 01:32:48,762
I didn't even tell
you when they was

2236
01:32:48,764 --> 01:32:50,664
shooting at the warehouse
what I was doing.

2237
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,986
Everybody's all over
the place, but I'm
locked in on Omar...

2238
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,901
JAMES: Omar.

2239
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:57,804
For the record,

2240
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:01,942
I would've never
taken your offer.

2241
01:33:01,944 --> 01:33:04,311
See, you always
missing the big picture,
James.

2242
01:33:04,313 --> 01:33:05,912
Yeah, but I ain't
gonna miss your ass.

2243
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,647
Oh.

2244
01:33:07,649 --> 01:33:09,182
Get his ass out of here.

2245
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,922
(AMBULANCE DOORS CLOSING)

2246
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,069
Ben held his own, huh?

2247
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,839
Did he impress you enough?

2248
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:36,776
We didn't get ourselves killed.

2249
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,778
So I guess he did all right.

2250
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:42,816
That was your approval.

2251
01:33:42,818 --> 01:33:45,885
You just gave
me your blessing.
Did you hear that, Ang?

2252
01:33:45,887 --> 01:33:48,855
James, you just
gave me your blessing
just now.

2253
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:51,858
James, don't you walk...
Come here, James.

2254
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,994
Baby, you gotta help me
because this
morphine done worn off.

2255
01:33:53,996 --> 01:33:55,862
This shit hurts. James!

2256
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:58,344
I can't chase you
because of my leg,
but I wanna give you a hug.

2257
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,809
Look at this, ladies.
He has amazing taste.

2258
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:11,277
Great taste, right?

2259
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:14,347
No. Hey...

2260
01:34:14,349 --> 01:34:18,184
I need you at least
15 feet away from
this grill at all times.

2261
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,086
James, please don't start.

2262
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:22,355
I can't even believe
you over here, man,
after what you did to me.

2263
01:34:22,357 --> 01:34:24,224
What I did to you
was not my fault.

2264
01:34:24,226 --> 01:34:26,026
You set me on fire!
You know what?

2265
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:27,994
On my phone I can
go to a website,

2266
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:31,064
and this website will
give me instructions
on how to use this machine.

2267
01:34:31,066 --> 01:34:32,198
You're not using my grill.
Back off.

2268
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,767
Give me your
Wi-Fi password.

2269
01:34:33,769 --> 01:34:35,235
No.
Let me get your wee-fee.

2270
01:34:35,237 --> 01:34:36,403
Give me the wee-fee!

2271
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:40,373
Suspect-shot-23.

2272
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:42,876
There's so many
other passwords
that you could have chose.

2273
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:44,377
Airplane. Bike.

2274
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,413
It's too much, man.

2275
01:34:46,415 --> 01:34:48,748
I'm in, watch out.
Let me do it.

2276
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,450
Move. No.
James.

2277
01:34:50,452 --> 01:34:52,919
Come on. Stop it.
This is unnecessary.

2278
01:34:52,921 --> 01:34:54,087
This is stupid.

2279
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:56,056
No, get back.
Will you trust me!

2280
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:58,925
I'm a man that's weeks away
from graduating from
the police academy.

2281
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:00,360
Dude, this is symbolic.

2282
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,364
All right.
Thank you.

2283
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:07,233
I turned the gas
on five minutes ago!

2284
01:35:07,235 --> 01:35:08,768
(SCREAMING)
(PEOPLE GASPING)

2285
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:14,841
BEN: I'm all right, Angela!

2286
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:17,310
(COUGHING) I'm okay.

2287
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:19,946
Hey, James,
you should give
your neighbors a call,

2288
01:35:19,948 --> 01:35:22,115
because I think
I killed their dog
when I came in hot.

2289
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,284
I might have
second-degree burns, people.

2290
01:35:24,286 --> 01:35:25,985
Let's just say
third-degree to be safe

2291
01:35:25,987 --> 01:35:28,021
because my chest
is blistering up
as we speak.
