I need some fuckin' proof. Yeah.

00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,922
Some soiled panties or something,

Some errant pubes,
a fuckin' used condom.

186
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:57,563
by the secret.

187
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,163
I wish for good things to happen...

188
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,670
to me.

189
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:12,612
Thought becomes thing.

190
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,941
Motherfuckin' what?

191
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:17,542
And Greg is my rock.

192
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:19,588
GREG:
Well, now, take it easy.

193
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:21,988
Let's not
get ahead of ourselves here.

194
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,010
I'm a ne'er-do-well,

195
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:44,478
and I have a moustache.

196
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,071
This doesn't happen overnight.

197
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:47,274
Mmm?

198
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,980
SLASHER:
Of all fuckin' people, Greg.

199
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,180
- (beast growls)
- (Secrets screams)

200
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,001
Okay.

201
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:15,543
(engines rumbling)

202
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:26,072
Ain't nobody home, husky.

203
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,745
Let's get the fuck away from here.

204
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,049
Where does he live?

205
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,623
Trans-Am ain't around.

206
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,755
That tells me
you're shit out of luck, lady.

207
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:42,923
You're fucking shit out of luck!

208
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:03,118
The monsters didn't attack.

209
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,277
They're gone.

210
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:08,357
We can make a run for it.

211
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:10,553
We ain't goin' nowhere, woman.

212
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,093
GREG:
What are you talkin' about?

213
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,427
That jail's the only safe place
in town.

214
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,963
We're going.

215
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,627
Greg, the fuckin' jail
is locked down, okay,

216
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,362
and we can't fuckin' make it.

217
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:23,167
Look outside. Have you seen
the amount of blood out there, nimrod?

218
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,264
Okay,
that's what going for it gets you.

219
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,702
I wished for this.

220
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,448
This is it.

221
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,016
I wished for this, and here it is.

222
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:40,249
This is not the fuckin' help.

223
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:43,556
I visualized this,
and they appeared.

224
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:45,753
SECRETS: This is proof.

225
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:48,355
SLASHER: Sweetie, help is the U.S.
of fuckin' A. military, okay?

226
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,557
That's a gang.

227
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,361
They got a fuckin' hostage,
for crying out...

228
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,628
Get down! The big guy is looking.

229
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:06,940
They're leaving.

230
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,141
We can't just let 'em leave.

231
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:10,650
SLASHER: Yes, we can.

232
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:12,118
GREG: They've got guns.

233
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:14,521
SLASHER: Duh,
and they'll fuckin' point them at us.

234
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:18,927
No, this is a time
for mankind to come together.

235
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,525
(loudly)
You're wrong!

236
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:23,530
SLASHER: Shut the...

237
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:24,566
GREG: Motherfucker!

238
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,625
SLASHER: Fuck you, Greg.
You gonna tell me about wrong?

239
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,135
You wife-fucker!

240
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,834
GREG: Get out of my way.

241
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,341
BIKER QUEEN: Come on.

242
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,439
He's probably headed for the city.

243
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:41,677
BARTENDER: I told you
where he lived, where he hung out.

244
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:44,550
Now, look, you cut me loose. Please.

245
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,780
BIKER QUEEN: Get comfy.

246
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:51,023
(engine rumbles, shuts off)

247
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:52,060
(Slasher grunts)

248
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:54,620
SLASHER: Bullshit. Stupid.
Stupid, stupid.

249
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:56,756
- GREG: Motherfucker!
- SLASHER: Fuckin' stupid!

250
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:01,027
BIKER QUEEN: Grab him.

251
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,867
Oh, what the fuck?

252
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,406
BIKER: Got him.

253
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:09,009
This shit's on you, Greg.
Fuck that.

254
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,517
Greg, by the way,

255
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,785
you're so fuckin' fired.

256
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:25,893
You know what?

257
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,259
I quit.

258
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:31,630
Ooh! Shit.

259
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:38,134
BIKER QUEEN: Is this him?

260
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:39,971
BARTENDER: That ain't him.

261
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:42,410
SLASHER:
Feel free to shoot him, though.

262
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,140
BIKER QUEEN:
How about you, fatback?

263
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,211
You drive a brown Trans-Am?

264
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:48,944
No! No, no, no, no.

265
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,610
I know the guy who does, though.

266
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:51,948
I sold it to him myself.

267
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,283
That ain't him, either.

268
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,222
- That's right. Could you please...
- Shit.

269
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,987
We hadn't even ought to be here.

270
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:01,559
You and your fuckin' revenge shit

271
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:03,223
are gonna get us all done in.

272
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:05,063
(Bartender grunts)

273
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,726
BARTENDER: Hey, hey.

274
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,668
Wait a minute.

275
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,899
Let me tell you somethin', mama.

276
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:15,107
I was a fuckin' marine
in the second World War, okay?

277
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:18,547
- And I got over the goddamn Krauts...
- Close the fuckin' door, please.

278
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,777
...and I got over the goddamn Japs,

279
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:23,012
so you get that stick
out of your ass,

280
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:26,455
and get over this fucking
vendetta bullshit of yours,

281
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:28,491
and let's get out of here.

282
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:29,547
What do you say?

283
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,290
We hadn't even ought to be here.

284
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:38,624
BARTENDER:
You and your fucking revenge shit.

285
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,632
BIKER QUEEN:
There anybody else in here?

286
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:45,802
No, not in here,

287
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,867
so could you please close the door?

288
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,747
(electricity crackling)

289
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:09,864
(biker girl screams)

290
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:16,098
(beast snarls)

291
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:17,264
(biker girl panting)

292
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,705
BIKER QUEEN:
Get back! Get back!

293
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,572
Get back! Shut the fucking door!

294
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:21,941
(roars)

295
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,282
(beast groans, roars)

296
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:27,509
Thank you for waking them up.

297
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:31,716
What have I been saying?
Shut the fucking door.

298
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:35,226
BIKER GIRL: Help! Help me! Please!
Open the door!

299
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,622
Open the... Aah!

302
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,464
(flesh ripping)

303
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:47,295
BIKER QUEEN: Hold the door!

304
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,359
That wall's coming down.

305
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,033
BIKER: What the fuck?

306
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:02,079
SLASHER: Wall's coming down.
It's made out of pigeon shit.

307
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:07,990
Motherfucker!

308
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:12,728
(rumbling)

309
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,798
SLASHER: Run!

310
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:33,614
(beast screeches in distance)

311
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:44,522
BARTENDER:
Aah! You asshole bitch.

312
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,205
Where'd he go?

313
00:22:58,273 --> 00:22:59,206
They ain't fuckin' here.

314
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:00,573
(loud roar)

315
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:06,007
(Bartender screams)

316
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,253

SECRETS:
We're gonna be safe. I know it.

(beast roars)

319
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,355
SLASHER:
Other way, other way, other way.

320
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:19,020
(beast roars)

321
00:23:30,072 --> 00:23:33,408
BIKER QUEEN:

00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:34,603
BARTENDER:
Lady, you know what?

323
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,442
You're out of your fuckin' gourd.

324
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:40,276
BARTENDER:
Your Trans-Am ain't here, he ain't here.

325
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,431
You son of a bitch.

326
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,804
(bartender groaning)

327
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,767
BARTENDER: Why are you stalkin'
the son of a bitch?

328
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,700
Lose a sister...

329
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,106
ask me again.

330
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,420

332
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:05,160
MAN: Hold it right there.

333
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:11,905
Now turn it around.

334
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:14,410
Turn it around.

335
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:16,379
Slowly.

336
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:26,319
Shit fire and save matches.

337
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:30,216
MAN: This is our hiding place.

338
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:34,289
You guys take your hide
up the street to the jail.

339
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,031
That's not gonna happen.

340
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:43,774
(gun cocks)

341
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,672
You get out.

342
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:48,713
How's that revenge thing
workin' out for ya?

343
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:51,942
BIKER QUEEN:
We're not going anywhere.

344
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,382
(pistol cocks)

345
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,155

350

I'm coming out. Please don't shoot.

351
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:48,597
- (cocks shotgun)
- Don't shoot. I don't have a gun.

352
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:51,108
Please. Oh, God.
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

353
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:52,801
I swear to God I don't have a gun.

354
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,472
I don't know these people.
I've never seen them before in my life.

355
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,039
I'm on my own.

356
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:06,053
People think
I'm just a dumb blonde.

357
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:08,854
They have no idea who I really am.

358
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:20,662
(gunshot)

359
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,167

360
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:29,210
(gasps) It worked!

361
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,584
Oh, crap.

362
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,689
BARTENDER:
You fucking chicken shit.

363
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:43,283
- No, I didn't mean to...
- Damn cunt.

364
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,691
No, please stop!

365
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:47,862
(screaming)

366
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:05,579
- (Bartender grunts)
- No! No! No!

367
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:11,988
No! No! No!
No, he's gonna kill me!

368
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:14,788
(both screaming)

369
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,619
You left us for dead.

370
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:21,825
You fraulein twat.

371
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,829
Get on your feet, goddamn it.

372
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:28,632
Get up here!

373
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,071
HONEY PIE:
They were gonna kill me!

374
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:34,001
HONEY PIE: I said I'm sorry!

375
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:36,013
BARTENDER:
Right there. Right there.

376
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,342
HONEY PIE: I said I'm sorry!

377
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:38,939
(grunts)

378
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:50,820
No!

379
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:55,933
Forgive and forget,
huh, old man?

380
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,062
- (Bartender growling)
- (Honey Pie screaming)

381
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,674
(flesh ripping)

382
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,840
(both gasping)

383
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:29,663
You worthless motherfuckers!

384
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:33,570
You think anyone gives a shit
about any of you?!

385
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:36,609
You all deserve to fucking die.

386
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,437
You can go to hell.

387
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:40,272
(sobbing)

388
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:46,839
BIKER QUEEN:
Where'd you get that?

389
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:53,622
Where'd you get this?

390
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:58,322
Oh, fuck me.

391
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,096
And fuck you, too!

392
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:03,725
Fuck yourself.

393
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,601
Give it! Give it to me!

394
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:10,904
She deserved it.

395
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:12,101
(Bartender yells)

396
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,610
(Honey Pie screams)

397
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,980
SLASHER:
It's rainin' bitches out here.

398
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,746
- Fuck you.
- (distant beast screeches)

399
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,012
Stop followin' me.

400
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:24,349
SECRETS: Greg.

401
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,855
Wait for us.

402
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:27,288
- SECRETS: Wait.
- SLASHER: Shit.

403
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:29,326
Get the fuck... Go back.
Go away.

404
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:30,792
SECRETS: Wait.

405
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:35,689
- (cell phone ringing)
- Oh, shit.

406
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,233
Shit, shit, shit.

407
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:38,893
Shh, shh.

408
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,871
Slasher's Auto Barn.

409
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:42,303
- Hello? Who is this?
- (beast roars)

410
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,400
THUNDER: <i>We're in the metal shop.</i>
<i>Just keep moving.</i>

411
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,275
<i>I can see you, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

412
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:49,312
SLASHER: All right.

413
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,682
<i>Keep comin'. Keep comin'.</i>

414
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:00,781
<i>Watch out for the crap.</i>

415
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:01,790
The what?

416
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:03,851
<i>The pile of shit, motherfucker!</i>

417
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,159
SLASHER: Fuck! Fuck.

418
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:07,994
- <i>Yo, man, look out!</i>
- What?

419
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:09,123
<i>Look out!</i>

420
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,998
(groans)

421
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:15,302
- My nose.
- Where you going, cocksucker?

422
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:19,038
Over there, in the fuckin' shop.

423
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,846
BIKER QUEEN: Where?

424
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:44,767
Monster!

425
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:46,360
Shut the fuck up!

426
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:47,995
- GREG: It's okay.
- THUNDER: Bitch.

427
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,700
It's dead. Now come on in.

428
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,002
Be quiet.

429
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,839
SLASHER: Fuck. Fuck me.

430
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:53,899
Fuck me.

431
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,083
All right, follow me. Come on.

432
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,025
SLASHER: Fuck.

433
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,731
THUNDER: This is our fort.

434
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:16,234
It's soundproof, so be quiet.

435
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:18,394
- SLASHER: What the fuck is this?
- THUNDER: Fuckwads.

436
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,936
(Bartender breathing heavily)

437
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,645
(Lightning speaking Spanish)

438
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:34,809
THUNDER: Shh.

439
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:37,980
Come on.
Come on, come on, man.

440
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:50,899
BIKER QUEEN:
You all kill that monster?

441
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,197
Hell yeah.

442
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,431
SLASHER:
And how'd you do that?

443
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:55,496
We got lucky.

444
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,709
THUNDER:
Yeah, yeah, come on!

445
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,574
Come on! Bring it on, baby!

446
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:01,474
Bring it on!

447
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:02,876
Yeah! Come on!

448
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:05,315
- Take that, bitch!
- (groans)

449
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,642
BIKER QUEEN:
Thanks for letting us in.

450
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:10,779
THUNDER: Not a problem.

451
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:14,259
There's an army convoy
goin' town to town, picking up survivors.

452
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,557
Way I see it,
we got about 15 hours.

453
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,826
Saw it on TV last night
before the power went to shit.

454
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,365
Phones?

455
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,833
Sure, they're workin',

456
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,995
except you're the only one
that's ever answered,

457
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,663
and that fuckwad across the street.

458
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:30,538
That jail is the only
real safe place in town.

459
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,076
She's built solid.
She's made of granite.

460
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,775
And that junkie bastard's
got it all locked up.

461
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,079
Ain't no way we're gettin' in there.

462
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,483
(generator whirs)

463
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:56,391
It's been goin' on and off for hours.

464
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:58,860
(burps)

465
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:03,507
It's over.

466
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:04,666
Beat that, <i>puto.</i>

467
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,179
(woman screaming)

468
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:09,976
Oh, stop!

469
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,053
No more.

470
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,518
No!

471
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,072
(beast roars)

472
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:43,078
(screaming continues)

473
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:04,662
(beasts roaring)

474
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,238
SLASHER: Why you motherfuckers
are so relaxed?

475
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,364
You up in here
playin' cards and shit?

476
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,773
This town is just waitin'
for a stiff wind to blow it over.

477
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,902
THUNDER:
If we keep quiet we'll be all right.

478
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,069
SLASHER: How's that?

479
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,704
Monsters don't eat where they shit,

480
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,509
and they don't hunt
what they can't hear.

481
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,608
BARTENDER:
Till they run low on food.

482
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,117
Then look out, brother.

483
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,121
Who's the dickwad in the jail?

484
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,986
GREG: That's the town meth-head.

485
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,582
BARTENDER:
That turd you been lookin' for...

486
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:03,493
the guy in the jail,

487
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,690
that's his goddamn uncle.

488
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:08,395
Give me the cell phone.

489
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:11,870
(phone beeps, rings)

490
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,178
Impenetrable fortress.
How can I help you?

491
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,879
Listen, motherfucker...

492
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,610
<i>we're down the street,</i>

493
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,178
and we need to get in there.

494
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,555
Now, you're gonna unlock that door,

495
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,650
'cause we're comin'.

496
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:39,257
Lady, tell me if this sounds
like I'm hangin' up.

497
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,665
- (dial tone)
- Motherfucker dies.

498
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,368
He definitely dies.

499
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,914
(distant beast roars)

500
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,472
We can get in that jail.

501
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:02,518
We just have to blow them doors.

502
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:06,288
With what?

503
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,422
This is a fucking metal shop, man.

504
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,259
Gotta be something around here.

505
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:17,203
Yeah, let's blow the doors off
and create a breach.

506
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,897
(generator whirs)

507
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,345
(generator fades)

508
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,810
That'd be real smart.

509
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,815
We're trying to use the building
for safety, you know?

510
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,816
What can we do?

511
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,615
SECRETS:
We have to think of something.

512
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,588
Honey, we've been trying
to think of something

513
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,180
for the last 24 hours.

514
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,453
You name it, we've thought of it.

515
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:45,997
SLASHER:
What about makin' a key?

516
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,573
You're the only
key-makin' wrestlers around here.

517
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,302
Make a fuckin' key.

518
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:59,071
THUNDER: Have you seen that?

519
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,806
It's 100 fuckin' yards away,

520
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,370
something the size of your asshole.

521
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,177
How do you suppose
I'm gonna be able to see it

522
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,717
in order to make a key?

523
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,883
(groans, knocks)

524
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,891
(beast roars)

525
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,089
(Honey Pie groans)

526
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,300
(beast snarls)

527
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,543
THUNDER:
Looks like a Magnum 860...

528
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,642
(distant beast roars)

529
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,815
...with a one-by-one rim cylinder.

530
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,516
LIGHTNING:
Magnum eight-six-zero.

531
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,114
(grunts)

532
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,730
(creaking)

533
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,298
(creaking grows louder)

534
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,404
(Honey Pie gasps)

535
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,843
(moans)

536
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:59,258
(distant beast roars)

537
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,971
(screams)

538
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,016
(distant beast roars)

539
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,454
All right, boys,
what can I do here?

540
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,959
THUNDER: All right, look.

541
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,188
The power comes back on,

542
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,060
we're gonna go.

543
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,429
- But you fuckin' watch our back!
- Got it.

544
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,559
Amigo, it's match time.

545
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,967
We got some lives to save,

546
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,298
so you down for this?

547
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,565
<i>Por Maria.</i>

548
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,047
BIKER QUEEN:
What the fuck are you doing?

549
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,673
(Greg grunts)

550
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,593
GREG: Look,
running and hiding won't last.

551
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,755
I mean, those little midgets
might find us safety for a few days,

552
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,958
but we need to be prepared
if it doesn't work.

553
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,430
BARTENDER: Oh, fuck.

554
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,058
You're not that guy, are you?

555
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,469
We need to know the enemy
from the inside out.

556
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:23,269
We need to know
what makes this thing tick.

557
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,675
I mean, what is it, right?

558
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:26,871
Where's it from?

559
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,042
(generator whirs)

560
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,617
We have to dissect it.

561
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,554
- SLASHER: It's go time.
- THUNDER: Come on, let's go.

562
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,904
Come on, boys. Come on.

563
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,326
(mumbling)

564
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,187
How does dissecting it
make any sense?

565
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,700
GREG: Hey, don't worry about it.
I'm pretty sure it does.

566
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,538
You ever seen these things fuck?

567
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,674
I mean, it's disgusting.

568
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,702
Oh, shit.

569
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,431
GREG:
All our questions are answered.

570
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,439
BARTENDER:
What? What's been answered?

571
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:14,987
(beast corpse breaks wind,
all groan)

572
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,750
BARTENDER:
Oh, shit.

573
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:19,224
(all coughing)

574
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,691
(vomits)

575
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:31,573
That's just the body
releasing gasses.

576
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:33,732
BIKER QUEEN: Jesus, man.

577
00:44:33,806 --> 00:44:37,370
(coughing continues)

578
00:44:37,443 --> 00:44:38,934

591
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:30,977
Shit.

593
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:57,500
(machinery whirrs)

594
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,055
GREG:
Okay, give me some light here.

595
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,459
Bear with me, people.

596
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,500
We're on the verge of a discovery.

597
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:30,974
(beast corpse breaks wind,
Secrets screams)

598
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:34,483
Shit! Shit! Shit!

599
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:52,561
GREG:
Oh, man, hey. Ooh, God.

600
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,092
Come here. Can you...

601
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,072
Hey, baby, here, here.

602
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:00,663
Take my jacket. Come here.

603
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,368
Let me just...

(slips in vomit)

605
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:07,207
I can't take it!

606
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,113
- Come here, take my hand.
- I just can't.

607
00:49:09,182 --> 00:49:10,172
Come on, take my hand.

608
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:11,740
Give me your hand.

609
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,879
(distant beast growls)

610
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:14,886
Listen to me.

611
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:17,390
You gotta be strong.

612
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,086
Be strong.

(Secrets shudders)

614
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:22,796
Okay?

615
00:49:25,564 --> 00:49:29,368
Quit touching
the motherfucking organs, asshole!

616
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:30,528
This is science. Shut up.

(all screaming)

618
00:49:36,743 --> 00:49:37,710
Oh, fuck!

(cocks shotgun)

621
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:25,423
All right, all right.
I'm done. I'm done.

622
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,093
Wait a second. Look at that.

00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,194
Look. Look.

624
00:50:39,572 --> 00:50:41,269
What the fuck is that?

No, I don't think...

What the hell happened here?

645
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,669
We were gone for,
like, two fuckin' minutes!

646
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,970
What the fuck happened to her?!

647
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,208

THUNDER: Aw, fuckin' A!

653
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:27,338
We were supposed to be safe here.

654

THUNDER: Yeah, we were,
till your queer fuckin' boyfriend

655

726
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,573

727
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:03,611
Ah, fuck!

Okay, okay, okay, okay,

733
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:50,889
There's a...

734
01:03:50,966 --> 01:03:53,300
There's a door on the jail roof.

735
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:57,040
We can get up there,

736
01:03:57,105 --> 01:03:58,972
we got plenty of time
to pop the lock.

737
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,907
How the fuck

738
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:03,813
BIKER GIRL: Shh. Shh.

GREG:
God, that sounds like a baby.

742
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,031
Oh, my God.

743
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:24,431
Someone's still alive.

744
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:25,968
A fuckin' baby.

745
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:27,195
SECRETS: My God.

746
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:28,430

BARTENDER: Careful, bub,

754
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:10,636
heroes don't do too well
around these parts.

755
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:15,511
Under the circumstances,
this might seem really, really dumb.

756
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:17,273
Ya think?

757
01:06:17,345 --> 01:06:18,371
If it's dumb,

758
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:19,914
I don't wanna be smart.

759
01:06:35,864 --> 01:06:37,766
This is how you save a life, people.

760
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:43,005
SLASHER: What the... Oh, shit!

761

Everything's okay now.

Everything's gonna be okay.

767
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:28,783
Come on, now.

768
01:07:29,718 --> 01:07:31,688
He's got the baby.

769
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:33,552
I wished for that.

770
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:36,650
Ask, believe, receive.

771
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:40,925

774
01:07:58,747 --> 01:07:59,680
He's gonna make it.

775
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:05,010
GREG: Help!

776
01:08:06,488 --> 01:08:07,922
Help!

777
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:09,618
He's fucked.

779
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,328
Hold on, baby.

780
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:24,104
You can do it, honey!

781
01:08:24,173 --> 01:08:25,801

01:08:56,071 --> 01:08:59,339
Sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

You piece of shit.

01:10:03,038 --> 01:10:05,372
Wow, that's bad.

790
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:06,636
Even for this group.

Aah!

BIKER GIRL: Aah!

803
01:11:24,654 --> 01:11:28,058
We gotta get to that fucking jail,

804
01:11:28,123 --> 01:11:30,093
or we're all goddamn dead meat.

805
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:33,188
Yeah, you got any ideas?

806
01:11:36,532 --> 01:11:38,058
Yeah, I got a fuckin' idea.

807
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:42,066
It's gonna require a sacrifice.

808
01:12:06,596 --> 01:12:08,691

Hello?

(glass shatters)

818
01:16:40,436 --> 01:16:42,372
It's gonna work.

819
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:46,233
Has to.

820
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:48,438
Looks dangerous.

821
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,242
It's perfectly safe for midgets.
Let's go.

822
01:16:50,313 --> 01:16:51,713
That's little people, motherfucker.

823

What the fuck ever, all right?
Come on.

824
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,354
This thing is gonna catapult

825
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,185
one of these little guys
all the way over there?

826
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:03,026
SLASHER: Yeah, that's right.

827
01:17:03,093 --> 01:17:05,529
That's right, and then we'll be safe
till the cavalry comes.

828
01:17:05,595 --> 01:17:07,497
No, fuck that. I ain't doin' that.

829
01:17:07,564 --> 01:17:09,056
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

830
01:17:09,132 --> 01:17:11,534
We just threw a woman off the ledge.

831
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:13,127
These bitches are
standing here butt-naked

832
01:17:13,202 --> 01:17:15,104
'cause we used they clothes

833
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,871

Fine.

838
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:33,347
Fine, grab the dead guy.

839
01:17:33,423 --> 01:17:34,322
We'll use him.

840
01:17:37,326 --> 01:17:39,558
Hey, hey, hey,
I ain't fuckin' dead.

841
01:17:39,629 --> 01:17:41,793
And don't touch the dick.

842

Fine, grab the old lady.
She's practically dead, anyway.

843

Listen to me.
You want to test it, right?

844

Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

847
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:56,914
This is one of those
fuckin' moments, right here.

848
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,973
It's a tough choice,
but it builds character, okay?

849
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:01,178
<i>Que sera, que sera,</i>
I don't give a fuck. We're usin' her.

(retches)

908
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:31,634
All right, let's give this thing a shot.

909
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:36,472
(engine rumbles)

910
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:40,607
Hit it.

911
01:24:51,963 --> 01:24:53,329
(whimpers)

912
01:24:54,165 --> 01:24:56,932
Whoo-hoo!

913
01:25:03,741 --> 01:25:07,236
(moans)

914
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:10,978
That is fuckin'
American ingenuity right there.

915
01:25:11,049 --> 01:25:12,449
That's what the fuck that is.

916
01:25:12,517 --> 01:25:13,850
I know horsepower.

917
01:25:13,918 --> 01:25:15,216
I know engines.

918
01:25:15,286 --> 01:25:17,552
It's what the fuck I <i>do,</i> okay?

919
01:25:17,622 --> 01:25:20,617
This is gonna be
our fuckin' salvation.

920
01:25:20,691 --> 01:25:23,663
(laughs)

921
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:27,726
Shit. That's fuckin'
factory-deal incentive right there.

922
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:30,793
Mm.

923
01:25:30,868 --> 01:25:32,336
Ow!

924
01:25:32,403 --> 01:25:33,838
Whoo!

925
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:36,239
All right, which one of you
fuckin' pygmies

926
01:25:36,307 --> 01:25:37,502
wanna be rocket man?

927
01:25:38,442 --> 01:25:40,241
(Honey Pie breathing heavily)

928
01:26:01,299 --> 01:26:03,030
(beast roars,
Honey Pie screams)

929
01:26:07,672 --> 01:26:10,507
(screaming)

930
01:26:17,516 --> 01:26:20,078
This is fuckin' bullshit!

931
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:21,141
SLASHER: You ready?

932
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:22,688
Yeah!

933
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:25,780
Hey.

934
01:26:27,091 --> 01:26:29,927
A coward dies a thousand deaths,

935
01:26:29,994 --> 01:26:32,522
but a hero dies just one.

936
01:26:32,598 --> 01:26:36,663
Yeah, that doesn't help,
baby-killer.

937
01:26:38,136 --> 01:26:40,607
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

938
01:26:40,672 --> 01:26:42,368
Okay.

939
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:45,006
We're all depending on ya,

940
01:26:45,076 --> 01:26:46,875
you little fart-knocker.

941
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:49,642
You can make it!

942
01:26:53,618 --> 01:26:56,248
All right, let's fuckin' do this!

943
01:27:14,739 --> 01:27:16,298
All right, listen.

944
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:18,037
Once you land,
you get in that door,

945
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:19,373
you don't fuckin' stop, all right?

946
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:21,208
Once inside,
you lay that motherfucker out,

947
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:22,714
and I mean you lay him out quick.

948
01:27:22,781 --> 01:27:25,013
We goin' be downstairs
poundin' on the door in seconds.

949
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:26,346
You gonna be downstairs?

950
01:27:26,418 --> 01:27:27,886
We're gonna be fuckin' downstairs.

951
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:30,149
You don't fuckin' stop!
You fuckin' don't stop!

952
01:27:30,221 --> 01:27:31,211
I won't, I won't.

953
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:32,188
All right.

954
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:43,460
Are you ready?!

955
01:27:45,537 --> 01:27:46,527
I'm ready.

956
01:27:51,075 --> 01:27:52,065
(engine revs)

957
01:27:53,445 --> 01:27:55,107
Aah!

958
01:28:08,926 --> 01:28:11,089
(groaning)

959
01:28:13,799 --> 01:28:16,270
You fuckin' assholes.

960
01:28:18,002 --> 01:28:20,496
(beasts roaring,
Thunder screaming)

961
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:33,812
Hey, should we turn this off?

962
01:29:23,201 --> 01:29:24,328
Get the fuck out of here!

963
01:29:38,049 --> 01:29:41,647
<i>¡Abuelita! ¡Abuelita!</i>

964
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,053
Fuck!

965
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:44,953
My fucking dick!

966
01:29:45,023 --> 01:29:46,753
Ah, fuck, my dick!

967
01:29:46,825 --> 01:29:49,422
Aah! Fuckin' dick!

968
01:30:06,211 --> 01:30:07,804
Fuck you,

969
01:30:07,879 --> 01:30:10,442
you fuckin' little
goddamn slippery midget.

970
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,586
(train passing)

971
01:30:19,758 --> 01:30:21,250
(whistle blows)

972
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,447
GREG: Help me. Help me.

973
01:30:47,519 --> 01:30:49,421
Help me.

974
01:30:57,562 --> 01:30:58,929
Oh, goddamn him.

975
01:30:58,998 --> 01:31:00,466
I hate those little fucks.

976
01:31:00,532 --> 01:31:03,333
Little midget. Little, tiny people.

977
01:31:04,603 --> 01:31:07,040
(Secrets crying)

978
01:31:24,891 --> 01:31:27,795
Special delivery, Tattoo.

979
01:31:38,403 --> 01:31:40,168
So, fuck you!

980
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:42,071
Fuck you, motherfucker!

981
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:45,469
<i>¡Abuelita!</i>

982
01:31:57,723 --> 01:32:00,125
(pounding, roaring)

983
01:32:00,192 --> 01:32:01,626
BARTENDER: They're gettin' in!

984
01:32:03,328 --> 01:32:04,007
