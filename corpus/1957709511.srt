Jeff, Heather. Heather, Jeff.

192
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:13,041
For the record, either prior to or during
your incarceration here at Spider head,

193
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,500
have you two ever spoken?

194
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,250
- No.
- No.

195
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,250
Ever interacted in any way?

196
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,291
Did I not just say no?

197
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,375
[Jeff] No.

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,291
So, what do you think?

199
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,750
Who are you asking?

200
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,833
I'm asking both of you.
Let's start with Jeff.

201
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,791
Yeah, she seems nice.

202
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,541
You like that word, but no,
I mean, how attractive is she?

203
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,500
What, Steve,
you can't see it for yourself?

204
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,125
Can you shut up, please?
I'm asking Jeff. How's she looking?

205
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,833
[clicks tongue] Come on, man.

206
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,958
- [Abnesti] A scale of one to ten?
- Um…

207
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,333
Yeah, she's a seven and a half.

208
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,666
[Abnesti] And, Heather?

209
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,416
He's all right. A five on a good day.

210
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,666
- Did you give her Honest-Ease?
- [Abnesti chuckles]

211
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,708
No, I would have to ask. You know.

212
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,416
I'm just kind of a bitch.

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh.

214
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,875
Well, then I would like
to change my vote to an eight.

215
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,583
[Abnesti] All right, uh, Jeff, Heather,

can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

217

351
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,208
[Jeff] What's up, Ray?

352
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,416
Someone wrote in shit
on the bathroom stall doors, that's what.

353
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Gross.

354
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,916
I'll find out who's shit-finger.
Hope it ain't you.

355
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
It's not.

356
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,958
["Breezin'" playing]

357
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,416
[Mark] Damn, I will never be as good
at anything as you are with that.

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,583
- [Jeff] You like that?
- [Mark] Yeah.

359
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,708
Hey, is there a drug
to make you forget shit?

360
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,083
Yeah, it's called old age.

361
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,166
[chuckles]

362
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,416
I'm looking forward to it.

363
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,041
[Mark] How you feeling?

364
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,500
[Jeff] I'm all right. A little sore.

365
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,458
It must've felt pretty good
at the time though.

366
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,250
Yeah.

367
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,250
- We can get you some cream for that.
- [scoffs]

368
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,791
I'm fine. Thanks, though.

369
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,916
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

370
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,375
While we're at it, try not to let
the girls touch your MobiPak.

371
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,541
And don't… And don't touch theirs. Okay?

372
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,958
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

373
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,208
they can flood.

374
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,625
You could lose control.

375
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,333
Cool.

376
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,583
Uh, hey, Mark?

377
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,875
Yeah?

378
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,416
Can you take me off snack?

379
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,458
Was something wrong? Problems with Lizzy?

380
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,916
Nah, just, I'm ready for a change.

381
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah. Okay.

382
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,291
Thanks, man.

383
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:46,916
[door closes]

384
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,333
[sighs]

385
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,666
[softly] God damn it.

386
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,583
Oh, my God.

387
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,541
Lizzy.

388
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,791
[Mark] Is she from Seattle?

389
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,958
Prescott, Arizona.

390
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,625
Ah, see? Jeff knows.

391
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,541
It's cool when folks get acquainted.

392
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,750
Speaking of,
I saw the box scores this morning.

393
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,166
You Mariners are on a bit of a streak.
We should pipe in a game later, huh?

394
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,375
Yeah, that'd be great.
Who're they playing?

395
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,625
Crap. Hey, Mark, return this.

396
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,541
Uh, Jeff, please take a seat.
Another full day ahead.

397
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,500
If you could read the headlines,
you can't, but if you could,

398
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,583
the world needs our help more than ever.

399
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,208
Now, we got two rooms running today.

400
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,125
Pay no attention to Dave, trust me.

401
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,583
Seriously, trust him.

402
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,458
[Abnesti chuckles]

403
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,375
Jeff…

404
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,708
All right. Recognize them?

405
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,416
That's very funny.

406
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,958
I'm gonna present you with a choice.
This is what I'm after.

407
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,583
- Mm-hmm.
- You see this remote?

408
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx,

409
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,125
or you could slide this button
and Heather gets some Darkenfloxx.

410
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,208
You see? You choose.

411
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,833
- They have Darkenfloxx in their MobiPaks?
- [Dave belches]

412
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,916
Excuse me.

413
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,750
Hey, Dave, how you feeling?

414
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,791
[vomits]

415
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,083
Hungry.

416
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,125
- Could he be shit-finger?
- Yeah, maybe.

417
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,625
All that food's
gotta go somewhere. [chuckles]

418
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,541
Where were we? Darkenfloxx.

419
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,208
Mark put it in the ladies' MobiPaks
in anticipation of this very study.

420
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,458
That make you feel uncomfortable?

421
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,416
[Jeff] A little.

422
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,041
Yeah? That's okay, it should.

423
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,166
But you know as well as I
it's just an agitator,

424
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,166
causes no permanent damage. All right?

425
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,458
So what's your decision, Jeff?

426
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,083
Is Heather getting
the Darkenfloxx or is Sarah?

427
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,583
I don't know, I can't say.

428
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,041
Can't say or won't say?
You kinda have to, you know that.

429
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,083
I mean, it's random if I do.

430
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,125
You feel your decision would be random?

431
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,208
Yeah.

432
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,791
[Abnesti] This is what we're testing for…

433
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,500
Is any residual fondness with…
With the ladies.

434
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,875
So why don't you tell me
how you feel about Heather and Sarah?

435
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,875
How I feel?

436
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,041
Maybe some Verbaluce?

437
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,125
[laughs] No.

438
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:24,458
I mean, it's not that I like 'em both,
or that I like one more than the other.

439
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:29,666
It's just, I… I just don't really feel
anything towards either of them, you know?

440
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,750
I mean, I can remember feeling
a certain way towards 'em,

441
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,625
but that's all kind of
hazy and worn off now.

442
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,708
And why such reluctance
to the Darkenfloxx then?

443
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,916
Because I was a part of I-16.

444
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,583
[breathing heavily]

445
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,875
I mean, I know what it's like,
and you know what it's like.

446
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,125
- It's…
- Yeah.

447
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,375
It's… It's horrible.

448
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:55,041
And I just…
I don't want to do that to anyone.

449
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,291
Look, I don't know. It's random.

450
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,750
Okay. I'll tell you what.

451
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,541
I'm giving
the Darkenfloxx to Heather. Okay?

452
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,833
Actually, I'm gonna give it to Sarah.

453
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,416
All right, Jeff, you've convinced me.

454
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,291
It would to you be random,
you truly have no preference.

455
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,875
My preference is that nobody gets it.

456
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,083
That makes two of us.

457
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,166
Three.

458
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,041
See what we just did.

459
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,083
With your help, we learned
a lot more about N-40.

460
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,583
"Luvactin," working title.

461
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,083
So, no one's getting Darkenfloxx?

462
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,166
[Jeff] Not today.

463
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,541
But we do need
to understand N-40 a bit better.

464
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,333
For instance, uh,
what's the drug's duration?

465
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,625
What's the variable effect
of its dosage?

466
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,458
You and Sarah were on double the dose
of you and Heather

467
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:52,333
and yet your feelings for the two women
are largely the same.

468
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,041
Don't you find that interesting?

469
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,166
Yeah.

470
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,208
Hey, uh, I, uh… I'm not one to bring
Darkenfloxx in any conversation,

471
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,583
but we have to know more about N-40.
It could be a game-changer, Jeff.

472
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,416
The work we do
could help millions of people.

473
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,083
You ever loved?

474
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,416
Yeah.

475
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,875
Yeah, you were lucky. Not everyone can.

476
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,125
You know that loneliness is as lethal
as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?

477
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:26,833
Look it up.

478
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,791
Imagine if we could destroy
all the world's cigarettes.

479
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:35,541
We'd have people everywhere loving,
being loved, capable of love,

480
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,708
and who would've made that possible?

481
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,875
- Gold star for me.
- [Abnesti chuckles] Yeah.

482
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,500
Yeah. And your new friend, N-40.
Yay for us.

483
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:44,791
[dully] Yay.

484
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,083
[Jeff] Okay. Thank you, ladies.

485
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,541
[keys jingling]

486
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,625
Excuse you, Jeff.

487
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,041
Hey. Everything okay?

488
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,583
Yeah.

489
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,875
They don't know how close
they came to getting Darkenfloxxed.

490
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,500
Yeah, I know. I get it.

491
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,666
But listen, man, think if you'd had
the benefit of one of our products

492
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,166
before your fateful night…

493
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,791
What is it you want, Jeff,
more than anything in the world?

494
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,208
To go back.

501
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,750
Yeah, thanks.

Hey.

Hey.

00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,291
Yeah, sure.

[beeping continues]

508
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,291
Ah, sorry.

509
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,833
It's all right.
I suck at this game anyway.

00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,083
- Hey, I wanted to...
- [security guard] Hey, Jeff.

512
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,166
Ah, Free Fridays.

513
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:52,958
Lucky.

your presence in this facility,

610
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:19,375

is a privilege. Is it not?

00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,250
and even that doesn't even
come close to it, honestly, I mean…

694
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,041
I felt like I was on fire.

695
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,416
I wished I was on fire.

696
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:01,166
I would have set myself on fire
to make it stop. It's horrible.

697
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,375
So they give this Darkenfloxx to someone?

698
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,958
I mean, not this time.

699
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,458
Well, that's good.

700
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,583
Jesus, you're shaking.

701
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,041
You're a good guy.

702
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:31,416
Look, I heard from Mark
that you asked to be taken off snack.

703
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,708
I assume that meant away from me, right?

704
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,375
It's 'cause of, uh…

705
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,958
Emma?

706
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,458
Yeah.

707
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,291
No, she's…

708
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,500
She's moved on.

709
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,583
It just helps to hear her voice sometimes.

710
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,541
Yeah, I know.
Of course, I get it, you know.

711
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,791
This place can really mess with your head.

712
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:09,166
I mean, they've been testing me up
and down a lot weirder stuff than usual.

713
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,625
It's just been really tough lately.

714
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:21,041
Sometimes, it's hard to remember
who I was before I came in here.

715
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,583
But, Lizzy…

716
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,250
When I'm with you…

717
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,083
That's the only time
I really feel like myself.

718
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,666
Hands up, Mark. Come on.
[grunts] There you go.

719
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,500
- [grunting]
- So, I had a big idea for G-46.

720
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, yeah? What, Laffodil?

721
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,250
Yes, uh, we sell it to comedy clubs.

722
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:59,208
That's a little idea, Mark. No offense.

723
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,875
Offense kind of taken.

724
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,416
Whoo-hoo! [grunting]

725
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,958
[panting]

726
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,750
What do I keep saying to you, huh?

727
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,125
I don't know, "Shut up, Mark"?

728
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,166
I say you gotta think huge.

729
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,041
You look at the world through
the wrong end of binoculars.

730
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:14,208
That's weird. Don't be weird.

731
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,708
Hey, uh, what time do we start?

732
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,791
Ten minutes.

733
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,875
Why don't you hit me? We got time.

734
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,833
Come on, hit me. Let's go.

735
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,500
- [Mark] Two?
- [Abnesti] Uh, make it three.

736
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,041
Remember, at least 12 hours apart.

737
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,125
Yeah, I've heard the dosing schedule.
Thank you.

738
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,333
Say it. Come on,
you've been wanting to for a while.

739
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,416
Best shot.

740
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:44,958
You of all people...

741
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,625
Should understand the risks?

742
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,000
That's what I'm trying to do.

743
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,708
- We can assess risks without taking them.
- Oh, can I?

744
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,791
Someone has to answer
for our products, Mark.

745
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,208
Doesn't that occur to you?

746
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,291
Life out there is not life in here, okay?
Shit is messy.

747
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,375
It's out of our control.
This is new frontier stuff here.

748
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,625
And when, not if, when one of
our compounds falls on its face,

749
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:07,458
one of us has to stand
in front of a bereaved loved one,

750
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:10,666
or Mike Wallace, or God forbid, a jury,
and answer for what we do.

751
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,083
What we made and bottled
and named and sold.

752
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,250
Is that gonna be you?

753
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,958
No, it's gonna be the guy who can say,

754
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,750
"You're right I stand behind our shit.
I've taken it myself."

755
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,166
Mike Wallace is dead.

756
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,666
Really? Hard to keep track.
Ed Bradley then.

757
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,750
Also dead.

758
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,291
Morley Safer?

759
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,708
Shit. Better to think someone's dead,
and find out they're alive.

760
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,541
Yeah, when you first hired me...

761
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,583
Yeah, you disapproved. Duly noted.

762
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:40,541
Hey, Jeff, how are you?

763
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,166
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to…

764
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,166
That's cool.
Maybe a bit of advance notice next time.

765
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
Sure.

766
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,916
Yeah, shall we?

767
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,250
Nobel Prize ain't gonna
win itself. [chuckles]

768
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,041
Mark?

769
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,333
I'm gonna freshen up,
so be down in a second.

770
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:04,833
[softly] Shit.

771
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,916
- Is Heather…
- On her way.

772
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,625
Beautiful people get away with too much.

773
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,375
I say that having
benefited myself from time to time.

774
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,125
Heather, thanks for joining us.
Be right with you.

775
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,583
All right, uh, Jeff,
I want to start by apologizing.

776
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:32,041
No, look,
I shouldn't have walked in on you.

777
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,458
Oh. No, not that. Uh…

778
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,958
Remember the other day when I asked you

779
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,375
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to
and you said neither?

780
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,250
Yeah.

781
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,750
That was good enough for me,
but apparently not the Protocol Committee.

782
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,875
- Mm-hmm.
- Three Horsemen of Anality.

783
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,250
They're not convinced
you don't have residual feelings

784
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,750
for Heather and Sarah.

785
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:54,125
So, unfortunately today we gotta do
a kind of a confirmation trial.

786
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,625
This time per
the Protocol Committee, Mark,

787
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:59,916
uh, instead of me asking you
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to,

788
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,375
which the Protcom felt was,
they say, "too subjective,"

789
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:08,083
we're gonna give the girl
the Darkenfloxx and then see what you say.

790
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,125
Once again on some Verbaluce.

791
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,666
You refreshed his MobiPak?
His quantities good?

792
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,041
They are. [softly] Plus
I already told you they are.

793
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,375
And what about Heather's?

794
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,833
You stood right there
and watched me, Steve.

795
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,708
That I did, Mark.

796
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:24,916
[chuckles]

797
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,125
Sorry, Jeff, we're a little tense today.

798
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,291
Not an easy day and everyone's
a little bit uncomfortable about this.

799
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,416
I don't want you to Darkenfloxx Heather.

800
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,833
Okay, good start.

801
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:39,125
Uh, is that because you love her?
Feelings of love?

802
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,208
No, I mean, I already told you that.

803
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:42,458
Yeah, uh, and I agreed,

804
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,166
but is this confirmation trial
about what you and I want?

805
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,083
Not so much.

806
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,333
What it is about
is about us recording what you say

807
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,458
as you observe
Heather getting Darkenfloxxed

808
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,791
for five minutes, that's all.

809
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,666
One five-minute trial. Okay?

810
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,541
So, here we go with the Verbaluce.

811
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,083
Drip on, Jeff?

812
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,416
Oh, come on, Jeff.

813
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,416
You should be flattered.
Did we choose Rogan?

814
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,333
You're afraid of Rogan.

815
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,083
Yeah, Rogan could kill you
with a box of Kleenex.

816
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:15,500
But no, we deemed your level of speaking
more commensurate with our data needs.

817
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,583
Drip on?

818
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,083
God, did you even know Heather's story?

819
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,666
You don't. Legally, you can't.

820
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,958
But does it involve whiskey,
gangs, patricide? I can't say.

821
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:31,958
But can I imply that her past
did not exactly include a dog named Lassie

822
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:35,041
and a lot of family talks about the Bible
while grammy sat doing macramé?

823
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,583
Can I suggest if… Mark, empty.

824
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,458
Can I suggest if you knew Heather's past,

825
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:44,583
making her feel briefly sad,
nauseous, and/or horrified,

826
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,166
it might not seem like
the worst idea in the world?

827
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,541
[sighs]

828
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:50,666
I don't know.

829
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,208
Am I a monster, Jeff?

830
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,666
Do I remember birthdays around here?

831
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,666
Who took you up
in his seaplane that one time?

832
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,125
- You.
- Yeah. And when we had

833
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,291
that outbreak of athlete's foot,
and your feet were rashed up,

834
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,000
did a certain individual
rush to pick up a prescription,

835
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,583
paying for it with his own personal money?

836
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:09,000
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

837
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,958
Seems unprofessional to bring up now.

838
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,375
Come on, Jeff,
what do you want me to say here?

839
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:15,541
Huh? Your Free Fridays are at risk?

840
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,125
[stumbling] Look,
I'm trying to help, Mr. Abnesti.

841
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,208
Steve!

842
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,458
Can you make a call for me?

843
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,333
Yeah, all right.

844
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,000
Let me give it a shot. Okay? BRB.

845
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:44,958
[sighs]

846
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:50,916
Lizzy.

847
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,166
Uh, Mr. Abnesti.

848
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,208
- My father in the room? [chuckles]
- Huh?

849
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:56,333
Who am I kidding?
He split when I was eight.

850
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,041
Shit, man. I'm sorry.

851
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,291
We're so happy to have you, Lizzy,

852
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:04,416
and not just 'cause of
your culinary skills.

853
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,541
You won best brisket
at the Prescott Barbecue Festival,

854
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,625
three years running?

855
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:10,833
How did you know that?

856
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,750
- It's my business to know.
- Wow.

857
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,208
You know, myself,

858
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,791
- I find brisket a little bit fibrous, but…
- Hmm.

859
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,125
Okay.

860
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,708
Did we snag you
those copper pots you're after?

861
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,541
I've been meaning to thank you.

862
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,583
Stop it, stop it, unnecessary.

863
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:29,666
You've been such a welcome addition.

864
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,750
- It's the least I could do.
- Thank you.

865
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,166
Mm.

866
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:37,291
In fact, you know, you made me feel, uh…

867
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,125
Made me feel a little bit foolish.

868
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,333
- Foolish?
- Yeah.

869
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:44,041
Just, you get someone's file

870
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,333
and, uh, you form these preconceptions,
even when you know

871
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:50,083
there were plenty of circumstances
and not so many fair shakes.

872
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:51,708
You still judge.

873
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,541
Hmm.

874
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,958
Anyone else here, um, know?

875
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:04,166
Oh, no. Our little secret.

876
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,541
Yeah.

877
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,541
[slurps]

878
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,500
Whoo!

879
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:14,416
This is good. A thousand copper pots
for Java like this. [chuckles]

880
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,666
Or maybe a field trip?
An Arizona girl-in-the-sunshine, huh?

881
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,083
Hi, Jeff. Uh…

882
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:30,333
I'm sorry, man.

883
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,666
Unfortunately, the committee
was very firm.

884
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,125
They insisted the test must be
continued as scheduled.

885
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,291
Otherwise, they're threatening
to remove you from this program

886
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,791
and send you back to State.

887
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,916
They need you to acknowledge, Jeff.

888
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,541
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time. Drip on?

889
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,541
Yeah, acknowledge.

890
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,208
Thank you.

891
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:13,916
Heather, hello again.

892
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,666
Good morning, again.

893
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,750
Drip on?

894
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:20,708
Acknowledge.

895
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,583
Okay, Mark.

896
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,958
{\an8}- [chimes]
- [MobiPak whirring]

897
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:31,416
[whirring stops]

898
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:41,875
I don't like this.

899
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,125
[groans softly]

900
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,416
Please. It's hurting.

901
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,583
What's wrong with me?

902
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:55,125
- [Abnesti] It can't hurt you.
- [whimpering] Shit.

903
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,041
[vomits]

904
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,500
Jeff, speak a lot, in detail.
Let's make something useful with this.

905
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:00,958
- [chimes]
- [MobiPak whirring]

906
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,166
[Heather coughing]

907
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,416
[MobiPak beeps]

908
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,791
Heather just vomited.

909
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,791
She appears to be
in a highly aversive state.

910
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,583
[Abnesti] Why don't you back us up?
What happened first?

911
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:12,916
[Jeff] She started to cry.

912
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:16,625
She seems confused by how she's feeling.

913
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,708
[whimpers]

914
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:18,916
[sobbing]

915
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,541
[Jeff] Now she's crying harder.
She seems unable to sit still.

916
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:22,875
And what are you feeling?

917
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:24,958
[breathing heavily]

918
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,666
- Melancholy. Culpability.
- [Heather] Oh, no, please.

919
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,000
[Abnesti] Mm-hmm.

920
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,083
Go on.

921
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,333
[Heather] No, no, no.

922
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,583
All I can think
is Heather was once a child.

923
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,083
- Loved by her mother and father…
- [panting]

924
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,083
…neither foreseeing that
one day she might do a terrible thing.

925
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,458
A thing that would separate her
once and for all from love.

926
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,041
Good, go on.

927
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,916
Divorce her from joy
and cause her unspeakable sadness.

928
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,958
And do you love her?

929
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,083
[screeching]

930
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,708
Help! Please! Please!

931
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:06,958
No.

932
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,250
[Abnesti] Hang in there, Jeff.

933
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,208
Hey, Mark. Any vestige of romantic love

934
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:16,041
- in Jeff's words?
- [MobiPak cracks]

935
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,267
- [Mark] No.
- [Abnesti] Great.

936
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,958
- [Mark] Just basic human feeling.
- [beeping rapidly]

937
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,083
[Abnesti] Excellent.

938
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,206
- [remote beeping]
- Steve.

939
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,375
{\an8}- [Abnesti] Mm?
- [Mark] I think it's flooding.

940
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,458
Get back!

941
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,375
Back off.

942
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,851
- I did. The effects not...
- [Heather shouting indistinctly]

943
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:29,958
[Abnesti] Try more red.

944
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,666
Heather is in great torment.

945
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,083
- [Abnesti] Back it off.
- [Mark] It's not working.

946
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:38,958
Heather, listen to me. Sit down,
don't raise a finger, that's an order.

947
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,375
Get away from me, please!

948
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,458
- [Heather screaming]
- Are you kidding me?

949
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,083
{\an8}Are you fucking kidding me?

950
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,583
Jesus.

951
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,041
This is bad. Get in there, go.

952
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:49,666
Shit.

953
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,875
Heather's destroying everything
within reach.

954
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,398
[Abnesti] Sit down.
That is an order.

955
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,208
I'm responsible.

956
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,708
Stay the fuck away from me!

957
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,625
I facilitated...

958
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:02,083
Heather, listen to me, deep breaths,
everything's gonna be fine, okay?

959
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,166
Just relax.

960
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,458
[Abnesti] Heather!

961
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:24,625
Oh, shit.

962
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,750
Oh, shit.

963
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:33,958
[Mark] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

964
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,375
[Mark] Oh, my God.

965
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,791
[Mark] Oh, shit!

966
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,583
Oh, my God.

967
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,416
[Abnesti] Oh, shit.

968
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,791
God damn it, Mark.

969
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:56,708
[Mark] I don't feel a pulse.

970
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:59,291
What is wrong with you?
I told you to back it off.

971
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,041
[Mark] What? What?
What? I… I did back it off.

972
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,559
- [Abnesti] Forget your…
- [Mark] I told you this would happen.

973
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,791
[Abnesti] She did not respond
to my direct order.

974
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,083
[Mark] You're talking shit.

975
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,083
You are afraid to commit…
I told you every time, don't hesitate!

976
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,208
{\an8}I give an instruction, do what I say!

977
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,750
"Abnesti Pharmaceuticals"?

978
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,500
[Mark] Steve, I warned you.

979
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,333
- You did not.
- [Jeff] This is his company.

980
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:23,208
- I told you.
- Do not blame me!

981
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,791
You did not listen, I told you.
This is your fault.

982
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,333
[Mark] I told you. I told you.

983
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:30,750
- [Mark] Give me… [continues indistinctly]
- [Abnesti] You remember that?

984
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,500
[both arguing indistinctly]

985
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,583
"Bingo"?

986
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,083
[Mark] You think I have one job?

987
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,666
[argument continues indistinctly]

988
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,625
N-40.

989
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:43,083
Can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

990
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,416
Acknowledge.

991
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,500
You see this remote?

992
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:55,416
{\an8}Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx.

993
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,041
I-16.

994
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,541
What the hell?

995
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,450
- [Mark] Where are you going?
- [Abnesti] Shut up, Mark.

996
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,083
B-6.

997
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:17,041
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

998
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,250
they can flood.

999
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,083
[dramatic orchestral music pulsing]

00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,083

00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,166
[panting softly]

1002
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,208
It's not your fault.

1003
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:17,583
Not your fault.

1004
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,750
["Peppermint Park" playing on stereo]

1005
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,708
[Ray whistling]

1006
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,333
[Mark] This has gone too far.
We need to report this.

1007
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:04,458
Grow up. You shouldn't act like
we've crossed some sort of line here.

1008
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:08,666
The time to worry about crossing lines
was a lot of lines ago.

1009
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,875
If anyone finds out
what happened to Heather,

1010
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,625
they'll shut us down, Mark.

1011
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,041
Everything I've accomplished will be lost,

1012
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,208
and don't think
they'll just come after me.

1013
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,625
You'll go down too.

1014
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,375
[Mark] Yeah.

1015
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:26,958
[sighs heavily]

1016
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,833
[Abnesti] Hey.

1017
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:32,291
I'm sorry.

1018
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:35,833
Okay, this was awful.

1019
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,791
But what do I always tell you? Hmm?

1020
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,291
Pressure forms diamonds.

1021
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,250
[chuckling] Yeah.

1022
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:47,833
This is fine, okay?

1023
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:50,166
You and I,
we're gonna redouble our efforts.

1024

and we'll change the world, Mark.</i>

1025
00:56:55,583 --> 00:57:00,291
<i>And Heather?
Heather died for the best of causes, okay?</i>

1026
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,750
Okay.

1027
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:05,833
"Okay" okay?

1028
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,000
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1029
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:09,833
- Okay.
- Yeah? Sure? Huh?

1030
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,583
[laughing] Come on, there you are.

1031
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,875
Hey, just go take some time, relax.

1032
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,125
Whatever helps you forget,
get out of here, go on.

1034
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:30,958
Damn it.

[breathing heavily]

1036
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,041
Is she dead?

1037
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,583
She's not the best.

1038
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,750
That's not fair. Yeah. Yes, she's gone.

1039
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:09,125
This, uh… You know, this is science, Jeff.

1040
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:14,416
And in science,
we have to explore the unknown.

1041
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,958
The unknown can lead to the unforeseen,

1042
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:19,375
- and we had no way of predicting that...
- I get it.

1043
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,125
[Abnesti] Uh, your tone
of voice there, Jeff,

1044
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,083
which I perfectly understand.

1045
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,666
But be fair. You think
what happened today, you think I liked it?

1046
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,291
I didn't. I'm a person too, you know, I…

1047
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:40,041
I have feelings, and no one
is more broken up about this than me.

1048
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:45,458
But in the long run,
our work will help ease suffering,

1049
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:48,375
it'll save lives,
not just one life, many lives.

1050
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,500
We're making the world a better place.

1051
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,083
Are we?

1052
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,416
[Abnesti] Yes, Jeff, we are.

1053
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:58,583
You should be proud.

1054
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,250
Personal sadness aside,
you did terrific in there.

1055
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:04,958
We all did terrific. Heather, especially.

1056
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,041
Right up into the point where she…

1057
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,458
You know, it wasn't her finest moment,

1058
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:13,625
but everything prior to that,
she was doing great

1059
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,750
and she'll never be forgotten.

1060
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,333
What?

1061
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,875
It's just tough.

1062
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,166
Yeah.

1063
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:33,041
Can I get you something
for how you're feeling?

1064
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,750
[relaxing music playing]

1065
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,333
[both laughing]

1066
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,208
[Abnesti] I swear,
G-46 is good shit, right?

1067
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,125
[Jeff] Yeah.

1068
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,458
[Abnesti] Maybe not change-the-world shit,
but it's good shit.

1069
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:55,375
[Jeff] It's definitely good shit.

1070
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,916
It's hard to have
even one sad thought on this stuff.

1071
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,291
What's your worst memory?

1072
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:03,875
What?

1073
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:06,541
I'm sorry, that's a stupid question.

1074
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:14,250
Mine, uh… [clears throat] Mine was… I was…

1075
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,541
I was eight years old

1076
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:20,791
and, uh, my dad told me
he was gonna take me to summer camp.

1077
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,291
I was so excited.

1078
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:26,666
And he dropped me off,
and it turns out it wasn't summer camp,

1079
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,208
it was foster care…

1080
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,625
[laughing]

1081
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,250
…and I never saw him again.

1082
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,833
Oh, my God.

1083
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,833
I'm laughing too.

1084
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,416
That's just so terrible, man.

1085
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:42,333
It seems funny. Try it.

1086
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:43,708
He never came back.

1087
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:47,625
He never came back.
Not even for a weekend.

1088
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,208
I'm actually sorry to hear that, man.

1089
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:52,291
Damn.

1090
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,791
Oh, the dose is too strong.

1091
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,500
God. [sighs]

1092
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:00,833
Man, look at us, huh?

1093
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,375
Jeff and Steve.

1094
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,750
Steve and Jeff hanging out.

1095
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:07,500
Friends.

1096
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,750
Ehh…

1097
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,166
- What?
- [laughing]

1098
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,541
Come on, we're up here together.

1099
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,041
Enjoying the view.
That's a friendly thing to do.

1100
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,875
You can… Well…

1101
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:22,958
You can walk out that door
anytime you want.

1102
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:24,916
I can't.

1103
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:28,250
No, I can't. Not anymore.

1104
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,166
What's stopping you?

1105
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:41,500
The same thing that's stopping you
and every decision I've ever made.

1106
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:45,333
The ones that led me here to this place.

1107
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,625
This is my one true love, Jeff.

1108
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:52,666
And once you fall in love,
it's hard to fall back out.

1109
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:56,666
[laughing]

1110
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,750
Okay.

1111
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:04,791
Jeff and Steve… stuck at summer camp.

1112
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,708
To Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

1113
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,291
[both laughing]

1114
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,708
[screaming]

1115
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,833
Get that fucking thing away from me!

1116
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,958
Lizzy, listen. Deep breaths.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1117
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:32,916
[Lizzy] Please!

1118
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,041
For the record, can you tell us
what you're so afraid of?

1119
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,666
<i>Get it the fuck away!</i>

1120
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,375
The Verbaluce isn't doing shit.

1121
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,666
Yeah. [chuckles]

1122
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,625
This one's a goodie.

1123
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,166
Phobica.

1124
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,708
[Lizzy] Please stop it! Please stop!

1125
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,416
Make people afraid of things
that are bad for them.

1126
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
What, like gluten?

1127
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,250
Yeah. Or thinking too much.

1128
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:55,375
[static]

1129
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:02,000
[whimpering]

1130
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,541
Please, get that fucking thing
away from me!

1131
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,708
[Mark] I'm worried about
post-traumatic stress.

1132
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:09,083
From the stapler?

1133
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,500
Hey, Lizzy? Lizzy, it's just a stapler.

1134
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:13,750
Just get away now!

1135
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,375
[Mark] What, should we pack it in?

1136
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,375
Steve, should we pack it in?

1137
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:22,500
- Yeah, okay.
- [whimpering]

1138
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:31,333
[Lizzy] The worst one yet. By far.

1139
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:34,916
How do you feel now?

1140
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:40,458
Not afraid. Just, uh… [sighs]

1141
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:41,583
Ashamed?

1142
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,791
Yeah, I hate that feeling.

1143
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:48,333
[sighs]

1144
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,375
I couldn't stand
feeling that way in front of you.

1145
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,250
That's why I asked to be off snack.

1146
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:02,750
[sighs]

1147
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,916
You know, all the years I spent at State.

1148
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,666
I come here, and I'm, like…

1149
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,833
Is this place even really so much better?

1150
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:11,916
Hmm.

1151
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,500
I mean, I'd take some beat downs.

1152
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,833
Instead of having a fear
of a goddamn stapler.

1153
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,041
[Jeff chuckles softly]

1154
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,541
Why do we keep saying yes?

1155
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,416
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge.

1156
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,083
And for what? A private hall pass?

1157
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,708
A bedroom to ourselves?
Copper freakin' pots? I mean…

1158
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:36,083
[sighs]

1159
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:43,791
All the times you've said yes,
why did you?

1160
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,833
I guess I felt like I deserved it.

1161
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,416
That's what I've been
meaning to tell you, Lizzy.

1162
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:05,083
[Emma] <i>Yeah. I think I might go with them.</i>

1163
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,416
Hey.

1164
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,833
Hey. Wait up.

1165
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,416
- [Jeff] She can't live without me.
- [man chuckles]

1166
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,416
[engine revving]

1167
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,291
You cool to drive?

1168
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:27,958
Ice cold.

1169
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Whoo!

1170
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:43,125
[imperceptible]

1171
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,333
[all laughing]

1172
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,416
Whoo!

1173
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:12,666
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

1174
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,625
- Jeff! [screams]
- [Emma screams]

1175
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,041
[fire crackling]

1176
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,333
[grunting and panting]

1177
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,500
Emma. Come on, baby. Come on.

1178
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,041
Emma! Come on, baby. Come on.

1179
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,833
[breathing heavily]

1180
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,291
[whimpers]

1181
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,166
[Jeff, over phone] <i>Hey, babe.</i>

1182
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,500
<i>I know you're probably getting sick of me
leaving these things for you,</i>

1183
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:08,000
<i>but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you…</i>

1184
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,541
<i>- And I'm sorry.</i>
- [line beeps]

1185
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,916
[voicemail] <i>The mailbox</i>
<i>for this customer is full.</i>

1186
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,666
<i>It cannot receive
any more messages at this time.</i>

1187
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,375
[imperceptible]

1188
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,958
I'm so sorry.

1189
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:33,333
Two counts, voluntary manslaughter.

1190
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,708
And that doesn't include Heather.

1191
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,916
Don't do that to yourself.

1192
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,875
That's not on you.

1193
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,125
You did everything you could.

1194
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,208
No.

1195
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,875
I said "acknowledge."

1196
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:53,500
And I don't even know why.

1197
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,666
You're a good soul.

1198
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:35,750
[door opens]

1199
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:37,000
[footsteps approaching]

1200
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,750
- We're bad. We're very bad. [laughs]
- [chuckles]

1201
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,333
For what it's worth, I think
we're the least of all evils in here.

1202
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,125
Yeah? What makes you say that?

1203
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,500
You hear things.

1204
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:58,958
Oh, you hear things?

1205
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,750
Yeah. You know Ray?

1206
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:01,833
Mm-hmm.

1207
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,125
So, after four times in jail for drugs,
Ray went to rehab

1208
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:09,791
and then to what they call
a rehab refresh,

1209
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:13,583
which is basically for people
who are so immune to rehab,

1210
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,375
- it stops working.
- Hmm.

1211
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:20,291
But he must have been immune to that too,
because then came his biggie.

1212
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,458
Triple murder.

1213
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:30,166
Yeah, his dealer, the dealer's sister,
and the dealer's sister's boyfriend.

1214
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,083
Shit, man.

1215
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,416
You know Rogan?

1216
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,041
- Big diesel Rogan. Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

1217
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,541
- Who doesn't know Rogan?
- He came home.

1218
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:47,125
Found his girlfriend cheating on him
and threw her out an eight-story window.

1219
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,416
Oh, shit.

1220
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,041
She did not survive.

1221
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:52,583
[chuckles]

1222
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,375
Crazy.

1223
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,750
Yeah, I don't get it.

1224
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:59,000
- Like, how's it possible, man?
- What?

1225
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:02,166
If we're all so bad, where's the bad?

1226
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:05,875
[Abnesti] You guys are up late.

1227
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,333
Yeah.

1228
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:10,666
Cheat day.

1229
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,125
Oh, Jeff, we may wanna reconsider
the community snack bowl, given, uh…

1230
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,208
Shit-finger.

1231
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,916
Yeah. Have a wonderful evening.

1232
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,166
- And you.
- And you.

1233
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:03,916
[whispering] Bingo.

1234
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:13,333
[MobiPak beeps]

1235
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:14,666
[MobiPak whirring]

1236
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,166
[Abnesti] Yes.

1237
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,541
Okay. I understand. Mm-hmm.

1238
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,625
Thank you.

1239
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:44,000
Hey, Jeff, thanks for coming in.
How're you feeling?

1240
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,541
Uh, I'm good.

1241
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:50,750
All right, good. Uh, listen,
this breaks my heart wide open.

1242
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:55,625
But Protcom are insisting
on one last trial to establish a baseline.

1243
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:56,541
Uh, we…

1244
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:01,041
You have to administer Darkenfloxx
to someone you've never shared N-40 with.

1245
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:06,916
Someone who?

1246
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:11,166
That's what breaks my heart, Jeff.
It really does.

1247
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:14,000
Eh, Mark, if you would.

1248
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,083
[remote beeps]

1249
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:31,375
No. Sorry, I can't do it.

1250
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:32,750
Of course you can, Jeff.

1251
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,875
This is the last time
anyone's gonna get Darkenfloxxed, okay?

1252
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,625
Yeah, uh, Lizzy doesn't deserve this.

1253
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,875
It won't go as far this time.
You have my word.

1254
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,208
You're not listening to me.

1255
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:44,291
Jeff, come on. You sound nothing like
the guy that first arrived here.

1256
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:47,458
That guy would've done anything
to make his crime right.

1257
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:49,416
[shouts] Would you just shut up, man?

1258
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm not doing it.

1259
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:58,916
Calm.

1260
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,333
Maybe we should take the night. Yeah?

1261
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,541
Things always feel better in the morning.

1262
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:16,333
Yeah, sure.

1263
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:30,583
Just remember, Jeff, uh, what you did
won't have to happen to anyone again.

1264
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,833
Drugs like this
will prevent places like this.

1265
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:37,250
No more damage, no more damaged people.

1266
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,583
Only you can prevent another you.

1267
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,000
Double his dose.

1268
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,291
I know you're struggling,
but this will help.

1269
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,833
What's in the red one?

1270
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,416
- [Etch A Sketch clatters]
- Sorry.

1271
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,500
[Jeff] It's just a toy.

1272
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,041
The red one's a placebo. We put it...

1273
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,125
Stop.

1274
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,625
Just stop.

1275
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:43,208
There is no Protocol Committee, is there?

1276
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,000
This is his company.

1277
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:49,875
I saw his letterhead.

1278
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:53,541
[imperceptible]

1279
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:55,250
Abnesti Pharmaceuticals.

1280
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,875
He's the one in charge

1281
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:04,083
and he's naming the drugs
using a goddamn Bingo card, Mark.

1282
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,583
What are you doing
working at a place like this?

1283
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,875
I mean, all this talk of N-40,
I call bullshit, man.

1284
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,125
Abnesti doesn't care about love.

1285
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,833
No, he cares about the red one.

1286
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:23,958
B-6.

1287
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,875
How can you go along with this?

1288
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,000
You could work anywhere.

1289
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,250
<i>Why here? Why him?</i>

1290
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,500
There are so few geniuses.

1291
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,750
<i>He promised me we would change the world.</i>

1292
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:53,041
<i>I just wanted to help people.</i>

1293
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:57,416
[case beeps]

1294
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,666
You still can.

1295
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:13,041
[ominous music cresendos]

1296
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,458
[case chimes]

1297
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,833
[chuckling] Hey, Jeff, man of the hour.

1298
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,458
Hope you got some sleep,
thought things over, yeah?

1299
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,458
Why don't you, uh, take the driver's seat?

1300
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:38,708
Mark's out today.

1301
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,375
He's got a stuffed up nose
or something. [laughs]

1302
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:44,500
Millennials, huh?

1303
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:49,875
Sorry, that's a… It's an unfair word.

1304
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,833
You think about it,
someone arbitrarily decides

1305
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:56,583
that everyone born between this date
and that date, they all act the same.

1306
01:16:56,666 --> 01:17:00,333
It's like a… A horoscope, but stupider.

1307
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:05,791
You and Mark are nothing alike.

1308
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I don't know.

1309
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,958
It was Mark who made me reconsider.

1310
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,166
Ah.

1311
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,333
Well, I'll forgive his sniffles.

1312
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,958
Anyway, so it's you and me
and Lizzy, makes three.

1313
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:27,875
How're you doing, Lizzy?

1314
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,833
Could use some Vitamin D.

1315
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,000
[Abnesti] We'll get you
some sunshine soon enough.

1316
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,250
All right, Jeff.

1317
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:39,666
Uh, I filled Lizzy's vials with
the last of the Darkenfloxx this morning.

1318
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,708
Dumped the rest. Gone.

1319
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:45,458
Shall we put this thing
behind us for good?

1320
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,291
Fine. Let's do this.

1321
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:50,041
[clears throat]

1322
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,416
Lizzy? Drip on?

1323
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,541
Yeah, acknowledge.

1324
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:59,166
[Abnesti] And, Jeff,
give Lizzy the Darkenfloxx.

1325
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:02,208
[delicate music playing]

1326
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:34,916
Sorry.

1327
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,041
Hmm?

1328
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,000
The answer is still no.

1329
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,166
[sighs] J… Jeff.

1330
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:49,375
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1331
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:53,750
[exhales]

1332
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:56,625
Okay. What are we
up against here, Jeff? Huh?

1333
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:01,083
You think you love her?
You don't even know her.

1334
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:04,458
I swear, the judgment on display
in this fucking building!

1335
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:08,333
How about
a little share circle, huh? Yeah.

1336
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:10,833
Why don't you
tell Jeff what you're in for?

1337
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:13,125
- I don't care.
- [Abnesti] That's what love is.

1338
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,708
Getting to know each other.
Let's get to know each other.

1339
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:17,458
Doesn't matter. She already told me.

1340
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,041
- Oh, did she? [laughs]
- Robbery. Big deal.

1341
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:22,750
Really? Is that what you told him, Lizzy?

1342
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,666
Your future husband, father of your kids.

1343
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:27,416
He deserves to know the truth.
Tell him. Come on.

1344
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,833
Hmm?

1345
01:19:28,916 --> 01:19:29,833
You don't have to.

1346
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,041
[Abnesti] Come on. Tell him.

1347
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,708
Come on, Lizzy, tell him. Tell him.

1348
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,291
No? All right, I'll do it. Okay?

1349
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:41,583
It's cool. I got your files right here.
Let's, uh… Let's see.

1350
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:44,500
Yeah? Let's find out about Lizzy.

1351
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,500
- Get to know each other.
- I don't need you to.

1352
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,416
- I know who I am and what I've done.
- Elizabeth Dianne Harris.

1353
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,458
Born in Prescott, Arizona.

1354
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,666
- Raised in a group home…
- I don't need you to. I know who I am.

1355
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,708
I know who I am!
I'm the mother who killed her baby.

1356
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:11,875
That's who I am, Jeff.

1357
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:17,875
[voice breaking] The mother
who forgot her little girl in her car

1358
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:21,166
at a Walmart parking lot
in July for three hours…

1359
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,375
While I went to work.

1360
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:31,666
One count, reckless endangerment.
One count, manslaughter

1361
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,333
of my nine-month-old little girl.

1362
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,333
My own…

1363
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:44,291
My own flesh and blood.

1364
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:59,708
Now, I don't know what kind of
sick-ass experiment this is,

1365
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:05,708
but whatever he wants you to do to me,
come on, let's get on with it, okay?

1366
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:09,291
The quicker we get over with,
it'll be better for all of us. [sniffles]

1367
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,958
Come on, man. You can't hurt me.

1368
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,125
[gulps]

1369
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:19,291
You can't hurt me.

1370
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:22,125
There's no greater pain
than having to wake up

1371
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:25,166
every fucking morning without her. Okay?

1372
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,666
And I know you think you love me,

1373
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,375
but anything in me worth loving
died with her long ago.

1374
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:36,041
So, come on. Let's do it.
Come on. Give it to me.

1375
01:21:36,666 --> 01:21:37,833
Fucking give it to me.

1376
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,791
Give it to me! Fucking do your job, Jeff!

1377
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,416
Give it to me!

1378
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,958

for the most important study of them all.

1420

- And what did we say?
- Yes!

1421
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,166
What were we saying yes to, huh?

1422
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,708
What were we agreeing
to put in our bodies every single day?

1423
01:23:57,541 --> 01:23:59,375
- B-6.
- [screams]

It doesn't make you

Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry.

[Jeff] <i>And it did work.</i>

Enough for you to live amongst killers.
But not enough for a gold star. Why?

1443
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:48,250
B-6 had to be perfect.

1444
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,125
The goal wasn't obedience.

1445
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:53,291
It was absolute obedience
without exceptions.

1446
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:57,166
We had to know,
could we get you to follow an order

1447
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:01,583
antithetical to
your deepest values and emotions.

1448
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:04,541
Do the very thing
you'd least want to do in the world.

Hurt someone you love.

1450
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:10,791
B-6 could force you to repeat
the precise act you most regretted,

1451
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:13,375
to harm another,
someone you held dear.

1452
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,666
It could force anyone to do anything.

1453
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,125
[Jeff] I trusted you.

1454
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:21,833
We trusted you with our lives!

1455
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:26,083
You made us do
all this shit to each other,

1456
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:28,458
thinking it was our choice,
but it was yours.

1457
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,083
You took away our...

1460
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:39,750
Can't you picture it?

1463
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:50,083
We'd be selling peace and harmony itself.

1464
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:53,916
The ability to compel people to act
on behalf of the greater good.

1465

what you did to Heather.

Why?

1492
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,875
Because I told you to, Steve,
