1
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:15,497
Can I try?

2
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:20,135
Careful. It's hot.

3
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:21,737
Ok, right there.

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,740
Right there.

5
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,175
Ok.

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,948
Try again.

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,616
Don't give up.

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,852
The only way to succeed
is with hard work.

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,822
That-a boy.

10
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:41,623
All right, let's try.

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,696
Can we work on the music box now?

12
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,098
Not today.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,266
We have to go to mrs. Martin's
house to fix her stove.

14
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:52,835
But it's christmas eve.

15
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:56,138
Exactly, which is why she's
paying extra for me to fix it,

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,639
so she can cook
christmas dinner tomorrow

17
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:00,075
for her family.

18
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,677
How do you think I paid
for all those gifts

19
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,746
waiting for you under the tree?

20
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,581
We have to earn our gifts in life

21
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,216
through hard work and sacrifice.

22
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,283
You understand?

23
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,985
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,587
I just...

25
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:15,324
I wish you didn't have to work
on christmas eve.

26
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:19,228
I do all of this so you can
have a better life than me.

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,031
One day, you'll be
rich and successful.

28
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:25,167
All your christmas wishes
will come true.

29
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,405
Come on, brian,
let's make a wish together.

30
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,777
You ready?

31
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:05,574
<i>And in other news,
santa will have a harder time</i>

32
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,342
<i>delivering gifts
this christmas eve.</i>

33
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,178
<i>It seems that ginger the reindeer</i>

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,914
<i>has escaped
from the local petting zoo.</i>

35
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,483
<i>Sounds like ginger
has finally snapped.</i>

36
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:19,321
Ahh!

37
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:20,556
Oh.

38
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,825
Ah, merry christmas, brian.

39
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:24,927
Still no decorations, huh?

40
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,962
Some of us are busy
working for a living.

41
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,131
Besides, it's not christmas day
until tomorrow.

42
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,834
Well, managing my trust fund
takes a lot of work.

43
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,136
I'm sure your parents
are very proud.

44
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,572
Well, yeah, they ac...

45
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,788
- oh, whoa, be careful.
There's a slippery patch there.

46
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,859
Merry christmas, folks.

47
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,827
Good morning, mr. Conway.

48
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,730
What makes it good, jet?

49
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,966
- Nothing.
It's a horrible day, sir.

50
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,100
You'll never get anywhere in life

51
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:07,202
with that kind
of negative attitude.

52
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,544
There is an ice slick out front.

53
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,079
It is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

54
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:18,113
On it, sir.

55
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,549
You have the board meeting
at 9:00.

56
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,284
And I need you to sign off
on some of these details

57
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,719
for the christmas carnival
fundraiser tonight.

58
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:26,088
Ugh, christmas.

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,756
Schmoozing with a bunch
of people I don't even like.

60
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,592
The hell is this?

61
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:31,994
Never show me one of these again.

62
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,161
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

63
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:35,130
I'm disappointed in you.

64
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:37,199
Just think about all the joy

65
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,634
this party brings to people
every year.

66
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,069
Or think about all the money

67
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,705
you'll be raising
for the hospital.

68
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,941
And it's a giant tax write-off.

69
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,011
- Oh.
Now there's a ray of sunshine.

70
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:50,545
Morning, all.

71
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,015
How are the numbers on our big
pre-christmas event, hmm?

72
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,917
Did the coupons we mailed out
bring in the business

73
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,218
we'd hoped for?

74
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:01,323
I'm afraid
the numbers aren't good.

75
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,992
We are down...

76
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:07,062
20% from last christmas,

77
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,299
which is down...

78
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:15,304
10% from the year before that one.

79
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:19,541
Well, we're just going
to have to work harder.

80
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,978
I would like a plan
for improving our retail sales

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,247
on my desk by the end of the day.

82
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,316
I don't care
if you have to work all night.

83
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:32,220
Um, it's christmas eve, sir.

84
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,423
I took my father's
tiny appliance repair shop

85
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,924
and turned it
into a multimillion-dollar

86
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,360
electronics retail chain,

87
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:40,829
number one in the region.

88
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,864
I didn't do it by taking days off.

89
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:47,803
It took hard work and sacrifice.

90
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:50,405
That is the key to success.

91
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,608
But I am a benevolent boss,

92
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:58,013
so if anyone can come up
with a solution right away

93
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,549
then you may all get home in time

94
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,118
to put out a plate
of cookies for santa.

95
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,121
Anyone?

96
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,556
Well...

97
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:09,224
some of our research shows

98
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,259
that pc electric is not reaching

99
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,695
our younger client base.

100
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:18,066
What about a rebrand?

101
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,669
Something fresher, more electric?

102
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,305
I love that idea.

103
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,773
We could hire a marketing firm

104
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,809
geared towards millennials
and gen z.

105
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,245
Maybe connect
with some influencers.

106
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:33,148
Oh, that sounds ridiculous.

107
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,282
And expensive.

108
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:36,451
How am I supposed to finance that?

109
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:39,021
We could get an investor.

110
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:43,425
Uh, I know business
has been off for a while,

111
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:45,994
so I've been researching
potential investors

112
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,397
in my spare time...
When I'm home alone,

113
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,198
because I live alone

114
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,268
and I have no life
outside of this job.

115
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,837
I mean, I do have a hamster.

116
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,939
But she's ignoring me right now,

117
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:58,807
because I ran out of her favorite

118
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,908
organic carrot crackers...

119
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,310
- Focus, jet!
- Sorry.

120
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:06,114
So the other day,
I heard from nina nishi

121
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,583
that she might be
interested in investing.

122
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,986
Oh, wait, nina nishi?

123
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,555
As in the founder of pocket.

124
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,023
That's the shopping app, right?

125
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,459
How do you possibly know her?

126
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,194
She follows
my hamster fashion account.

127
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,362
Oh.

128
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,265
Anyway, she's in town
today, actually.

129
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:27,536
So I could set up
a lunch or something.

130
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,971
Why would she invest in us?

131
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:33,208
So she just sold pocket
for a ton of money,

132
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,410
and she's looking
for her next project.

133
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:40,182
She seems to think
pc electric might be it.

134
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,623
Fine.

135
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,058
Set it up.

136
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,328
Nina wants to meet you
at the store

137
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,463
so she can check it out.

138
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,364
So I don't have
to pay for lunch, perfect.

139
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,801
I should warn you, though,
she's a bit, um, unpredictable.

140
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,571
- What does that mean?
- Papa!

141
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,840
- Harkin! Michelle.
What a surprise.

142
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:05,974
Hi.

143
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:07,209
I have a surgery scheduled today,

144
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,010
and my nanny just called in sick.

145
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:10,846
Dave is in paris
with his new girlfriend.

146
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,114
I need someone to watch her again.

147
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:14,716
- You want me to babysit?
What about your mother?

148
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:16,184
Well, besides the fact
that I trust her even less

149
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,588
with a child than I trust you,
she is in brazil in a yurt,

150
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,623
ironically enough
searching for her inner child.

151
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,824
Ha.

152
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,960
I... you can just put her

153
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,695
in a conference room
with her ipad.

154
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,497
She won't bother anyone,
right, sweetie?

155
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,298
- I can do a cartwheel.
Want to see?

156
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Well, maybe later, sweetie.

157
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:32,901
I can't.

158
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,669
Today's a really busy day
with work.

159
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,238
Please, dad, I'm desperate.

160
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,539
This is a really
important surgery.

161
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,574
- I would love to.
It's just not a good day.

162
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,743
I'm really good at cartwheeling.

163
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,111
I'm sure you are.

164
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,579
I'll figure it out.

165
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,615
It's fine. Come on.

166
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,283
So I'm not going to play
with papa today?

167
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,384
No, no, not today, sweetie.

168
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,353
Michelle.

169
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:52,821
You'll be at the carnival later?

170
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,756
After all, it is a fundraiser
for your hospital.

171
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:55,924
Of course.

172
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:58,026
I always do what's expected of me.

173
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:01,396
Come on, let's go.

174
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:04,966
Boy, today could not end
soon enough.

175
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,273
Think we'd have more people here,

176
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,607
the day before christmas.

177
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,377
I'm sure it'll pick up
with last-minute shoppers.

178
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,211
Oh, there she is!

179
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,613
Nina.
- Jet.

180
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,316
It is so good
to finally meet you in person.

181
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,254
This man is a creative genius.
- Oh, stop it.

182
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:27,856
Hamsters are the new ferrets.

183
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,591
- If you say so.
- I do.

184
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:32,093
I have very good instincts
about animals...

185
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,228
And people.

186
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,696
Shall I show you around the place?

187
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,464
- Oh, of course.
- After you, please.

188
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,432
Thank you.

189
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,438
Whoa. Love it, love it.

190
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,874
So old-fashioned and out of touch.

191
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:48,243
Well, I prefer the term "classic."

192
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:49,911
- gumdrop?
- Oh, no thank you.

193
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:53,114
- Oh, come on.
Just... nah, nah, nah, nah.

194
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:54,449
Mm.

195
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,252
Listen, I've been running
the numbers jet sent.

196
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,654
Your overhead is too high,

197
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,923
but there's a real opportunity
to leverage market share

198
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,492
by expanding the omni-channel
retail strategy.

199
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,127
I'm definitely interested.

200
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,063
We have been experiencing some...

201
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,631
Some supply chain issues.

202
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,967
Is that the newest pokémon game?

203
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:13,201
I'll take all of them.

204
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,070
What will you do with so many?

205
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:17,172
Give them away, of course.

206
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:19,274
I mean, I love buying presents.

207
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:21,876
What fun is being rich
if you don't spend it?

208
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,812
Speaking of spending money,
I hear you have

209
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,780
a big fundraiser tonight.

210
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,215
Yes, for bradley hospital.

211
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,817
We're raising money
for the new children's wing.

212
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,951
You should come.

213
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,920
I know how much
you love christmas.

214
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,688
Presents and shiny decorated trees

215
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,323
and santa and candy everywhere.

216
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:36,925
I mean,
who doesn't love christmas?

217
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,059
Oh, I love christmas.

218
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,295
I knew we'd get along.

219
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,997
All right, I've gotta run.

220
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,431
There's a gingerbread house
eating contest

221
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,599
I plan on winning.

222
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,067
I'll see you tonight
and we'll talk later.

223
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,502
See you there.

224
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:53,008
You know, I'm starting
to like this day.

225
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,443
I may even be feeling
some of that christmas spirit

226
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,712
they talk about.

227
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:00,649
No, that's just heartburn.

228
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,574
Thank you so much for coming.

229
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,444
Oh, heavens... well, listen,
save a dance for me, ok?

230
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,715
Brad, bernadette,
go have a couple of drinks.

231
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,317
We'll talk about
your checkbook later.

232
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,086
Take care.

233
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,523
Oh, dr. Angeloni,
thanks for coming.

234
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,625
With the money you raise
for the hospital

235
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,161
and the work
your daughter does for us,

236
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,962
I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

237
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,231
It's the least I can do
for the children.

238
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:55,170
Merry christmas, brian.

239
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,872
- Sarah brown.
How long has it been?

240
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:59,274
Since you broke my heart?

241
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:02,844
As I recall, you're the one
who broke up with me.

242
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,245
I got tired of waiting for you

243
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,680
to come home from the office.

244
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:06,815
I was building a business.

245
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,851
Silly me. I was building a life.

246
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:13,121
Well, what brings you here?

247
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:14,889
Was it to see me?

248
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,426
No, I volunteer at the hospital.

249
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:22,530
I'm here on a date.

250
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,965
I should go find him.

251
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,101
Merry christmas, brian.

252
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:32,440
- Oh, great, you made it.
- Yeah.

253
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,376
- Let me introduce you...
My daughter,

254
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,310
the brilliant surgeon.

255
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:38,446
She works at bradley, you know.

256
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:39,714
It's been a bit
of a rough day, dad.

257
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,850
I'm sorry, I have to go talk
to someone important.

258
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,256
- you know what?
Just give me the whole can.

259
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,759
Did you just tip him $100 for
a whole can of whipped cream?

260
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:51,893
It should be $200, right?

261
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,262
I mean, it's christmas.

262
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,232
I'm glad you could make it.

263
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:00,001
I can't resist
a good christmas party.

264
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,137
This is not
a good christmas party, though.

265
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,038
I mean, it's called
a christmas carnival,

266
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,007
but there's no games,
there's no fun,

267
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:07,575
there's not even a santa claus.

268
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:09,878
You should dress up as santa.

269
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,814
That will never happen.

270
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,582
It's really not
that kind of party, anyway.

271
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,718
It's more of a fundraiser
for the kids.

272
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,986
Well, people would give a lot more

273
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:19,654
if there were actual kids here,

274
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,423
having fun, opening presents,

275
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,525
spreading sticky candy cane
joy everywhere.

276
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,826
I'll keep that in mind
for next year.

277
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,861
Well, next year you won't
have to worry about it.

278
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,196
Why is that?

279
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,331
Because I don't want
to invest in your company.

280
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,267
I want to buy it.

281
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:33,902
Buy it?

282
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:34,869
The whole thing?

283
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,037
I'm an only child.

284
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,639
I might like to give things away,

285
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:38,907
but I don't like to share.

286
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,042
I need to be in charge.

287
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,945
This company, it's my whole life.

288
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,181
I'm gonna bypass the deep
sadness of that statement

289
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:47,816
and just point out,
you're gonna make

290
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,150
a lot of money in this deal.

291
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,952
You'll be so rich
that you will never have

292
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,220
to worry about money again.

293
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:53,521
You'll be able to do
whatever you want.

294
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:54,756
You won't have to answer
to anyone.

295
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,925
Your life will be all about you.

296
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,860
It's a family business.

297
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:00,995
My father...
- Would want this for you.

298
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,797
You took his tiny, struggling shop

299
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,000
and turned it into a company
worth millions.

300
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,435
Think of how proud he would be.

301
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,441
You'd have to promise to keep
the fundraiser every year.

302
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,543
Bradley hospital is very
important in this community.

303
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:18,012
Of course.

304
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,147
Why not?

305
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,615
- Really?
- Yes.

306
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:23,685
I have worked hard.

307
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,287
It's time I got
what I deserved, huh?

308
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,589
Let's drink to that.

309
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,958
Here's to my just desserts.

310
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,159
Mm.

311
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,393
- Mm.
- Ah.

312
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:34,362
You know, I'm beginning
to like this day.

313
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,498
I wish it would never end.

314
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,632
Sir, it's time for your speech.

315
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,800
Oh, right.

316
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,869
Yeah, I'll just go
spread the good news.

317
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,772
Mm.

318
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:48,610
Good evening, everyone.

319
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:49,944
I'd like to welcome you

320
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,247
to the pc electric
christmas carnival.

321
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:59,787
I'd like to thank you for your
support for bradley hospital

322
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,790
and for giving so generously
of your time...

323
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:05,527
And your money too.

324
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,597
Now, my commitment to the hospital

325
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:10,899
isn't based solely upon the fact

326
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,634
that my brilliant daughter,
michelle,

327
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:13,801
happens to be a surgeon there.

328
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:16,037
There she is, yes, yes.

329
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,372
Don't be so shy, honey.

330
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:23,244
But I am also dedicated
to this community.

331
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,513
And in the name of community,

332
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,049
I would like to announce
that I intend to forgo

333
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,951
the customary christmas bonuses
this year

334
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,387
and instead give
a sizable donation

335
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,490
to the hospital
on behalf of my employees.

336
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,861
- So we get nothing.
- And he gets a tax write-off.

337
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,863
Generous and business savvy.

338
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,831
The man is a machine.

339
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:47,869
It's the least I can do.

340
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,805
And the least you can do
is go have some fun.

341
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,740
Enjoy yourselves, please.

342
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:56,411
May your christmas be
full of gifts,

343
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:59,647
preferably purchased
from pc electric.

344
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,187
Go on out there. Enjoy yourselves.

345
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,755
Thanks again for coming.
How was that?

346
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:08,656
Pretty great, I'd say, huh? Huh?

347
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,024
Yeah, you were great, yeah.

348
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,859
It's just been
kind of a tough day for me.

349
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,194
Listen, something else
has come up.

350
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:16,497
I'm thinking about selling
the company to nina nishi.

351
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,467
- Who? What?
You're selling the company?

352
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:20,735
What are you gonna do?

353
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,204
What's gonna happen
to your employees?

354
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,872
That's not my problem.

355
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,609
- Brian. Brian, come on!
Let's celebrate!

356
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,177
We'll talk about it later.

357
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,946
Oh, my.

358
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,881
I had no idea
you were so much fun.

359
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,708
The heck is going on?

360
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,590
Merry christmas, brian.

361
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,093
It's not christmas yet.

362
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,095
Ooh, you're right.

363
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:24,298
And I'm afraid
it never will be for you again.

364
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,535
Am I dead?

365
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:28,736
Pretty much.

366
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:32,140
I'm just here
to send you on your way.

367
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,909
The angel of death is santa?

368
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,645
It's different for everyone.

369
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,049
And, well, tis the season.

370
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:44,285
- But I'm not ready to die.
Not today.

371
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,254
I'm just about to get
everything I ever wanted.

372
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:49,123
Really? Are you sure about that?

373
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,059
Please, give me a second chance.

374
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,260
I'll do anything.

375
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:55,930
Well, you're not quite
on the naughty list,

376
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,032
but you've never been
particularly nice.

377
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,067
I'll change.

378
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,269
I promise, I'll work harder.

379
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,073
I'll do better. Just let me live.

380
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,975
Oh, you know,
I'm feeling generous today.

381
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,044
I'll tell you what, I'll give you

382
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:11,979
12 days to get it right.

383
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,648
12 days of christmas eve.

384
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,149
Oh, 12 days.

385
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,418
12 days. So I'm not gonna die.

386
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,620
Well, that's up to you.

387
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:22,423
If by the time
the 12 drummers drumming

388
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,092
have beaten their last note,

389
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:29,564
you still haven't figured out
the true meaning of christmas...

390
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,633
The true meaning of life...

391
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:36,003
Well, then, it's off to that
giant christmas tree farm

392
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:37,839
in the sky.

393
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:42,343
I promise, I'll learn it.

394
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,145
I'll live it.

395
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,713
I won't let you down.

396
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:51,285
Blow out the candle
and go deck those halls.

397
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:55,656
Is that...

398
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,412
Weird dream.

399
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,417
<i>And in other news, santa will have</i>

400
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,787
<i>a harder time delivering gifts
this christmas eve.</i>

401
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,288
<i>It seems that ginger the reindeer</i>

402
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,891
<i>has escaped
from the local petting zoo.</i>

403
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:32,460
<i>Sounds like ginger
has finally snapped.</i>

404
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,236
Ah, merry christmas, brian.

405
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,739
Yes. It's not christmas, is it?

406
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:46,274
It's still christmas eve.

407
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,742
It was all a dream.

408
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,113
Ok.

409
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,388
Oh, whoa, be careful.

410
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,989
There's a slippery patch there.

411
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:07,662
Merry christmas, folks.

412
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:11,065
I'm afraid
the numbers aren't good.

413
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,501
We are down...

414
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:16,370
20% from last christmas,

415
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:19,540
which is down...

416
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,577
10% from the year before that.

417
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,379
Some of our research shows

418
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:27,448
that pc electric is not reaching

419
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,051
our younger client base.

420
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:34,422
What about a rebrand?

421
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:38,526
Something fresher, more electric?

422
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,529
- She doesn't want to invest.
She wants to buy the company.

423
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,130
Who is she?

424
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,298
Nina nishi.

425
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,434
How do you know that?

426
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,069
She told me yesterday.

427
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:51,572
You spoke
with nina nishi yesterday?

428
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:54,342
It wasn't a dream.

429
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,444
It happened,
and it's happening again.

430
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,412
What's happening again, sir?

431
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,815
I can't... I can't breathe.

432
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,183
It's real.

433
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,618
Santa was real.

434
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,919
I've got to get out of here.

435
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:07,054
Are you ok? Do you need cpr?

436
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:08,656
Have to find santa.

437
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:09,490
Have to find santa.

438
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:10,391
Papa!

439
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,560
Oh, I can't watch her today.

440
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:13,794
I can't!

441
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,463
How did you know
I was gonna ask that?

442
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:18,566
Because it's the second day
of christmas eve.

443
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:20,668
Gotta find santa.

444
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,069
I gotta find santa.
- Hey, watch out for the...

445
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,571
ah!

446
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:25,373
Oh, damn.

447
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,076
Well, that was quick.

448
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:31,178
Why are you doing this to me?

449
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,647
You asked for this.

450
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,148
You begged me.

451
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,550
You said you wanted to live.

452
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,119
We made a deal.

453
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:40,421
You said you would do better.

454
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:44,492
This isn't a dream,
and it isn't a joke.

455
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:46,761
You've already wasted one day.

456
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:49,997
You've got ten days left.

457
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,433
Don't blow it.

458
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:53,701
You just watch.

459
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:55,202
I'm gonna make this
the merriest christmas eve

460
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:56,671
anybody has ever seen.

461
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,841
Oh, hey. Merry christmas, brian.

462
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,845
Jason, have you ever seen
one of those time loop movies

463
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,146
where a person gets stuck
in the same day

464
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:22,980
over and over again?

465
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,482
Oh, yeah, I love those.

466
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,117
How do they usually get out of it?

467
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,652
Well, they usually get out of it

468
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,987
when they stop being selfish
and start helping other people.

469
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,523
- Exactly. Yes, that's it.
That's the answer.

470
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,358
- Well, yeah. To what?
- To life.

471
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,826
All I have to do is make

472
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,062
everybody's christmas wish
come true, and I'll live.

473
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,031
This is gonna be so easy!

474
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,435
Ooh, he's cracking up.

475
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,338
Morning, sam.

476
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,774
Merry christmas!

477
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,742
So since the christmas spirit

478
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,679
is all about giving
and caring for others,

479
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,014
I have decided to give you all
the week off.

480
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,650
And I'm going to give you
a 10% raise

481
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,952
and a week's salary as a bonus.

482
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,354
Everyone?

483
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,856
Yes, jet, everyone, including you.

484
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,458
Although I do still need your help

485
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,061
with the christmas carnival
stuff this evening, all right?

486
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,464
I have to raise as much money
as I possibly can for santa.

487
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,167
I mean, for the hospital,
of course.

488
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,602
How are we going to pay
for all of this?

489
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,438
The numbers are down.

490
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,672
We'll worry about that
tomorrow, dale.

491
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,175
Today, our only concern
is that everyone is happy.

492
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,544
Ooh, that reminds me,
I'd better get going

493
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,013
if I'm going to get all
of my good deeds in today.

494
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,583
Papa!

495
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,051
Oh, guys, guys, hi.

496
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,620
Listen, this... this should...
Should cover a sitter.

497
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,090
And I'll tell you what,
no... why don't you just

498
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,991
take the day off
and go shopping on me?

499
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,927
What's going on?

500
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,730
- Can't talk!
Gotta go save the world!

501
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,168
Whoa, whoa, hey, listen.

502
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,704
Didn't get me this time, huh?

503
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,306
Oh, sorry, I'll have to owe you.

504
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,741
I'm fresh out of cash.

505
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,016
Wow, there's a lot of them.

506
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,720
What the heck. I'll take them all.

507
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,591
Ah! Stop! Stop!

508
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,300
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss.
Thank you.

509
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,336
Merry christmas. Here we are.

510
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,571
A little something for you,
just because it's christmas.

511
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,340
And how about
a nice big green box?

512
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,508
Come to my party later.

513
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,576
Oh, look.
Yes, a little triceratops.

514
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,844
Give that to a youngster you know.

515
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:36,747
Hello, my friend.

516
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,948
Here you are.

517
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,583
What am I supposed to do
with this?

518
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,786
- Well, whatever you like.
You see how unselfish I am?

519
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,621
Merry christmas.

520
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,922
You see, santa?

521
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:45,890
You see all the nice things
I'm doing?

522
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:47,491
You can't kill me now.

523
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,227
Santa kills people?

524
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,530
No. It was a joke.

525
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,498
I was kidding.

526
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,535
Here, have a toaster.

527
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,671
That one doesn't count.

528
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,477
My goodness, I love this jacket.

529
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:07,711
You know what,
I haven't seen that since...

530
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,246
What was that movie
with dennis hopper?

531
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,261
Brian has lost his mind.

532
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,397
And most of next year's budget.

533
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,635
Good evening, everyone.

534
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,571
Thank you for being here
and supporting me

535
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,673
and bradley hospital.

536
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:38,576
I have been selfish

537
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:42,179
and stingy sometimes,

538
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,148
but that is all about to change.

539
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,051
Now, I am interested
only in giving.

540
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,753
After all, isn't that
the meaning of christmas?

541
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:53,190
So let's keep giving
to bradley hospital

542
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,425
and to each other.

543
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:55,626
Aha!

544
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,697
Merry christmas.

545
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,165
You guys, you came.

546
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,600
Oh, this is wonderful.

547
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,202
Did you see? Did you see that?
Did you see how generous I was?

548
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,704
Dad, what is going on?

549
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,507
I am making everybody's
christmas wishes come true.

550
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,975
Ooh, speaking of making
wishes come true,

551
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,176
wait till you see what I got you.

552
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,044
Jet.

553
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,180
It's the dog you always wanted.

554
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,548
She's allergic.

555
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,816
Barely.

556
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,718
A few sniffles never hurt anybody.

557
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,219
- Let's go, let's go.
- What?

558
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,153
I have to get her some benadryl.

559
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,622
- Why?
- Ok?

560
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,723
Michelle.

561
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,025
Oh. Oh!

562
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,461
I was only trying
to make her happy.

563
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,162
She doesn't need a dog
to make her happy

564
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,732
or any of the 10,000 presents
you had delivered today.

565
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,401
She just needs a grandfather
who pays attention to her.

566
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,903
I was paying attention.

567
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,337
I knew she wanted a dog.
I got her a dog.

568
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,607
Ok, well, we will see you
at christmas tomorrow.

569
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,813
And get that animal out of here.

570
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,216
Oh!

571
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,718
Oh!

572
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,523
This is pointless.

573
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:00,824
If helping all those people
doesn't get me

574
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,293
to christmas day,
then nothing will.

575
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:06,864
Who were you helping
besides yourself?

576
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,900
And what would
an 80-year-old grandmother

577
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,202
do with an electric razor?

578
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,272
Did you happen to notice
her facial hair?

579
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,041
All right, all right, all right.

580
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,109
I get it.
I'll think of a better gift.

581
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:22,079
Christmas isn't about gifting.

582
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,181
It's about giving.

583
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,649
Giving what?

584
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,251
Well, that's something
you'll have to figure out

585
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,752
on your own.

586
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,127
These numbers are unacceptable.

587
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,129
If you people can't come up
with a plan to improve them,

588
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,564
I'm just gonna sell
the whole company

589
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,267
and hope they fire
each and every one of you.

590
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,904
Jet, get me an appointment
with nina nishi.

591
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,839
She's in town
and she's interested.

592
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,074
Wait, I was gonna...

593
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,775
But how do you know that?

594
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,577
I don't pay you to ask questions.

595
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,845
I pay you to do what I tell you.

596
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,114
Yes, sir.

597
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,515
No one appreciates what I do.

598
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:01,118
I am tired of working this hard
and getting nothing in return.

599
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,287
When is it my turn?
When do I get what I want?

600
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,388
What do you want, sir?

601
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,857
To be happy,
just like everybody else.

602
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,392
Papa!

603
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,395
Harkin, hi!

604
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,998
And you, my beloved child,
here to tell me again

605
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,599
what a selfish person I am
for not wanting

606
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,202
to watch my granddaughter.

607
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,638
Not wanting to watch
my granddaughter

608
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,840
go another day without telling her

609
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,942
how much I love her.

610
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,244
What?

611
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,146
Don't you have
a very important surgery today?

612
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,015
You need someone
to look after her, I will.

613
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,149
- You will?
- You will?

614
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,283
Of course, no problem.

615
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,185
- Yay!
Can I show you my cartwheel?

616
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,487
Maybe a little later.

617
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,688
Thanks, dad.

618
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,922
I wouldn't ask
if I wasn't desperate.

619
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,724
I know how busy you are.

620
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,826
It's really generous of you.

621
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,895
From your lips to santa's ears.

622
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,667
Ok, then.

623
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,569
I will see you guys
at the carnival tonight.

624
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,505
- Great.
- Great.

625
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,506
Have a good surgery.

626
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:58,742
Yeah.

627
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,278
After all, it's not like I haven't

628
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,780
raised a child of my own.

629
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,081
And you're a good kid.

630
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,849
How hard could it be?

631
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,985
- Can I have a nintendo switch?
- No.

632
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,286
- Can I have an iphone?
- No.

633
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,021
- Can I show you my cartwheel?
- No.

634
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,556
- Can I get a puppy?
- No.

635
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:13,957
Jet, when does nina get here?

636
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,125
Any minute.

637
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,561
Listen,

638
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,996
take her, give her some candy
or something.

639
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,097
Just to keep her distracted.

640
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,298
Are you sure?

641
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,566
She's already had
two hot chocolates

642
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:23,834
and, like, five candy canes, so...

643
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,302
- I don't care.
Just keep her away.

644
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,604
- Yes, sir.
Come on, harkin, let's go.

645
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,873
Oh, nina, how lovely to see you.

646
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,341
Well, I am so happy to be here.

647
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:33,444
Papa, I don't feel good.

648
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,611
I'm sorry about this.

649
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,947
This is my granddaughter, harkin.

650
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,817
How sweet, learning
the family business already.

651
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,719
Yes, you know me,
all about the children.

652
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,187
I want to go home.

653
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,254
Not now, honey.

654
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,756
Papa has to finish this meeting.

655
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,725
I want to go home now.

656
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:48,959
Kids.

657
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,794
Just give me
one more minute, all right?

658
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,234
Maybe I should come another time.

659
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,368
No, no. No.

660
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,870
I'll just go wash up. It's fine.

661
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,973
You should come to
the christmas carnival tonight.

662
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,608
Yeah, that's a great idea.

663
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,210
We'll talk then.

664
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,145
I feel much better now.

665
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,318
You're happy here, honey?

666
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,819
Nina can't make it.

667
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,055
She said she'll meet you
in town next time she's here.

668
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:21,125
- No, it has to be today.
There's no tomorrow.

669
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,226
Tomorrow is today.

670
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,528
Yesterday is today.

671
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,662
Now is all I have.

672
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:26,964
That's so deep.

673
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,098
I'm sorry I'm late.

674
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,166
I had a rough day.

675
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,567
Oh, did you?

676
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:31,969
Did it involve getting puked on?

677
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,470
Or losing out on the business
deal of a lifetime?

678
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,405
'cause that was my day.

679
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,307
I'm sorry, papa.

680
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,544
Oh, it wasn't your fault, sweetie.

681
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,815
Really?

682
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,385
Now what?

683
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,403
You're on the right track.

684
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,473
You're just going
in the wrong direction.

685
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:14,278
Maybe try asking harkin
where she wants to go?

686
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,479
Mmm!

687
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,290
Thanks, dad.

688
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,225
Are you sure you can keep her
all day?

689
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,393
We'll see you at the carnival.

690
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,097
Great.

691
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,467
- Bye.
- Bye.

692
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,737
Well, harkin,
what would you like to do?

693
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,905
Today is your day.

694
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,207
Really?

695
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,341
Really.

696
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,910
Today is all about you.

697
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,616
Oh, my god.

698
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,589
You're a mess.

699
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,525
Oh... oh, yeah,
everybody needs a triceratops.

700
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,361
Let's try to...
Oh, yes, take that for sure.

701
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,336
Oh, boy. Whew.

702
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:15,239
I have not been sledding
in a long time,

703
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,674
not since your mother
was a little girl.

704
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,676
Gosh this is... this is fun, huh?

705
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:20,811
This is the best day ever.

706
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,655
You know those kids?

707
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,558
They go to my school.

708
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,026
Why don't you go on
down there and play with them?

709
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,361
They don't like me.

710
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,796
Oh, come on, harkin.

711
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,366
You gotta make some friends,
you know.

712
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,268
If you're gonna be a leader,
you gotta have some followers.

713
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,469
No.

714
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,904
Why are you being so difficult?

715
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,572
You're acting
just like your mother.

716
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,607
Yeah, well, I'd rather be
like her than you.

717
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,577
She's right,
you are just a mean old man.

718
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,414
Harkin.

719
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,217
Harkin, I'm... I'm sorry.

720
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,286
I'm sorry. I'm coming. I'm coming.

721
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,362
Ahh!

722
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,238
I gave her everything she wanted.

723
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,374
You did, but what about
what she needs?

724
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:41,758
And then benjamin farted

725
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,527
and the whole class smelled
like dead fish.

726
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,296
That is terrible.

727
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,732
It was awesome.

728
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,275
What is it about those kids
that makes you look so sad?

729
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,378
They think I'm weird.

730
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,680
Everyone thinks I'm weird.

731
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,583
You know what you have to do
to make those kids like you?

732
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:07,551
What?

733
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,286
Nothing.

734
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,320
Huh?

735
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,389
Do you like them?

736
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,024
Not really.

737
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,659
Do you like yourself?

738
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,461
Yes.

739
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,030
Then that's all that matters.

740
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:24,234
Because you are amazing.

741
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,569
And life is too short
to worry about people

742
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,906
who do not appreciate
your big, beautiful heart.

743
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,209
How did you get to be
so smart, papa?

744
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:38,515
- I'm still learning...
Something new every day.

745
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,552
Let's play a song.

746
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:47,090
Oh, yeah, good idea,
let me pull a quarter out...

747
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,860
I have a quarter.

748
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:50,827
You put it up there.

749
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,101
It's broken.

750
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,508
It's too bad
I don't have my tools.

751
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,543
You know what,
I bet I could fix this.

752
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,045
You can fix stuff?

753
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,279
Yeah.

754
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,081
Actually, I'm pretty good at it.

755
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,282
I can fix things.

756
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,651
Can you teach me how to fix stuff?

757
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,453
Let's find out.

758
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,022
This is where it all started.

759
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:23,427
My dad, your great grandfather,

760
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,696
was a real whiz at fixing things.

761
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,266
And he and I would go
to the junkyard together,

762
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,536
and we'd find some stuff,
and we would fix it together.

763
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,675
When your mom was little,
I'd come out here late at night

764
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:42,079
and tinker just to take my mind
off of things at work.

765
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,281
Boy, it's been forever
since I've been out here.

766
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,320
Let's get started.

767
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,354
You need to know
some of the basics, all right?

768
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,090
This here, this is a wire stripper

769
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,592
and a pair of pliers,
needle nose they call them.

770
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,494
Almost everything you need to do

771
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,129
in any kind of repair work,

772
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,597
you have to use screwdrivers.

773
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,166
You see that? Ok, cool.
Here's what we'll do.

774
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,768
You take the negative
and I'll place this

775
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,570
on the positive.

776
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,338
You see that?

777
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:14,678
There you go, that's it, honey.
Yeah.

778
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,812
Very good.

779
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,381
Ok, great.
Now, let's give her a try.

780
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,287
You can do the honors.

781
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,726
Well, here, hang on.
Let's adjust a little bit.

782
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,663
It works. We fixed it.

783
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,932
This is the best day ever.

784
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,604
Now, that's enough of that.

785
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,240
I wish I could fix my mom
like we fixed the radio.

786
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,309
What's the matter with your mom?

787
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,811
She works too hard

788
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,746
and she's stressed out
all the time.

789
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,515
If I had one christmas wish,

790
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,783
it would be for her to be happy.

791
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,952
Well, you know what,

792
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,155
let's just see what I can do
about that.

793
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,090
After all, I'm pretty good
at fixing things, aren't I?

794
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,526
Really? You're the best.

795
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,263
- you're the best, kid.
Hey, you know what?

796
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,397
We got some time
before the carnival,

797
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,865
why don't we go over and deflate

798
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,167
all of jason's
christmas decorations?

799
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,301
Come on.
- That sounds naughty.

800
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,903
Let's do it!

801
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,344
Hey.

802
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:22,445
Today was awesome.

803
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,114
Can I spend every day with papa?

804
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:26,550
Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know.

805
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,218
What is going on here?

806
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,452
I'm gonna go get some cookies.

807
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,355
Ok, we'll see you in a little bit.

808
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,523
Is this the twilight zone?

809
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,625
More like groundhog day.

810
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:36,927
What?

811
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,695
We went shopping together.

812
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:41,431
I taught her how to love herself.

813
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,867
And then we went to the workshop

814
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,502
and fixed an old radio together.

815
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,270
You let her go in your workshop?

816
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,405
You never let me go in there.

817
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,740
Now, I've got
a great surprise for you.

818
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,809
You've been working so hard
lately at the hospital,

819
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,212
with harkin, and all
the volunteer work you do.

820
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,680
You've done so much
for everybody else,

821
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,348
I thought it was time
someone did something for you.

822
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,550
So I called you boss.

823
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,085
You're free for the week.

824
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:06,122
We're going
to the bahamas tomorrow.

825
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,225
Tomorrow is christmas.

826
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,526
I'd like to spend
christmas at home.

827
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:12,429
I don't want to be on a plane.
- But...

828
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,897
and those are
really important surgeries

829
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:14,998
I have next week.

830
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,466
Honey, you need to have a break.

831
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,101
- You don't know what I need.
You never have.

832
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,570
You were always too busy
working to know what I needed.

833
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:21,771
I did that for you.

834
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,274
No, it wasn't for me.

835
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,009
It was so that you could prove
to the world

836
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:29,145
and to your father
what a success you were.

837
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,380
You've never loved me.

838
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:33,950
- That is not true.
- Well, that's how it felt.

839
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,018
Come on, harkin.

840
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,586
We'll make...
- I want a cookie.

841
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,855
No, we'll make some cookies
at home, ok, honey?

842
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,958
Hey b-man, I heard you were
looking for investors.

843
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,726
Let's talk.

844
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:45,028
Not the best time, nina.

845
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,903
Make it quick, santa.

846
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:07,117
So what have you learned
so far, brian?

847
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:11,288
I've learned how important
my family is to me.

848
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,557
How their happiness
is what matters.

849
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,128
I want to make
harkin's wish come true.

850
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,197
I want michelle to be happy.

851
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,734
I want to make her love me again.

852
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,472
But I... I just don't know how.

853
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:33,810
Well, you've got six days
to figure it out.

854
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,612
Don't give up.

855
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,349
Christmas is
just around the corner.

856
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:40,817
Christmas or die.

857
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,457
That is the choice, right?

858
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,361
Afraid so.

859
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:55,398
Well, then, I choose christmas.

860
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,115
"better off alone."

861
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,050
"raised by wolves."

862
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,019
"when parents don't care
about you."

863
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,588
I care.

864
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,357
I'd say I'm more of a bear
than a wolf.

865
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,858
What's that, papa?

866
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,294
Oh, nothing, honey.

867
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,062
You know, I'd like to get
something really special

868
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,664
for your mom
for christmas this year.

869
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,132
What does she like?

870
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:32,402
She likes food carved
to look like animals,

871
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,504
animals dressed up like food,

872
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,439
she likes pretzels
dipped in frosting,

873
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,241
rolled in sprinkles,

874
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,909
and she likes dancing
in her pajamas

875
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,644
to irish folk songs.

876
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:42,579
Her favorite is...

877
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,694
how did you know that?

878
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,130
I used to sing it to her
when she was a little girl,

879
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,565
just like my dad sang it to me.

880
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,102
Mostly she likes helping people.

881
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,071
That's why we have
all those bills.

882
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,107
She's always giving
her money away to charity.

883
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,710
Well, and all those
massive student loans

884
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,145
you made or take out to teach her

885
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,313
"fiscal responsibility."

886
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,582
yes, everybody has to learn

887
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,152
that nothing in this life
is for free.

888
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,754
Mom and j.Lo say
that love don't cost a thing.

889
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,890
Oh.

890
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,958
Well, today,

891
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,427
at least these christmas cookies

892
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:31,528
are for free.

893
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,029
With milk?

894
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,764
Just like santa.

895
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,777
Here comes the big finish.
Wait for it.

896
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,188
That always used to make
your mom laugh her head off.

897
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,656
And then it was lights out.

898
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,224
Here we are.

899
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:23,980
I told you not to call me today.

900
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,383
I know, sir, but it's nina nishi.

901
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,485
She wants to meet with you.

902
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:31,087
She's very interested
in investing.

903
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,922
Well, look, I promised harkin

904
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,024
that I would teach her
how to fix a radio.

905
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,126
<i>Training her to take
over the family business?</i>

906
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:40,697
Maybe.

907
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,298
That gives me an idea.

908
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:45,201
Thanks for coming all the way out.

909
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,469
Yeah.

910
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,937
Oh, that's my granddaughter
there, harkin.

911
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:48,905
- Hi.
- I promised her

912
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:49,873
we'd fix something together.

913
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,008
Oh, that's so sweet.

914
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,078
My grandfather also loved
to fix things.

915
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,314
It's one of the reasons
I'm interested in pc electric.

916
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,249
It reminds me of him.

917
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,250
Would you like to have a seat?

918
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,584
Oh, no, go ahead.

919
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,719
Oh, thank you.

920
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:05,655
Now, I have been
doing some research.

921
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:06,756
And it's my understanding

922
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,224
that in order to make
whipped cream,

923
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,659
you've got to have
some heavy cream,

924
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,428
a few drops of vanilla,
some powdered sugar,

925
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,897
and you whip it
until you get stiff peaks.

926
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,798
Am I right? Hmm?

927
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,234
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

928
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,703
Mmm. Oh, so good.

929
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,306
Look, I'm not gonna
waste your time.

930
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,807
I'm gonna be honest with you.

931
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,876
Pc electric is struggling.

932
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,645
We need an investor.

933
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,980
I can stay stuck in the past

934
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:33,850
and, apparently, in the present.

935
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,151
But if I want to save my company,

936
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:37,387
I have to look to the future.

937
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,189
I believe you are
the kind of person

938
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,458
who can lead me to tomorrow.

939
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,360
What makes you think that?

940
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:47,430
Well, like I said,
I've done my research.

941
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,365
You graduated top of your class
at harvard business school.

942
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,700
Hm.

943
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:52,302
All the startup companies
you've invested in,

944
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:55,071
every one is making strides
in innovation

945
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,006
and in market share.

946
00:42:57,108 --> 00:43:00,243
You know how to work hard.

947
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,412
And you go after what you want.

948
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:05,014
Well, work is pretty much
all I have going on in my life,

949
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,250
so I better be good at it, right?

950
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:11,421
What about your family,
friends, love?

951
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:16,359
I'm not really good at that stuff.

952
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:19,562
It's just easier right now
to just focus on work.

953
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:22,632
There'll be plenty of time
for family and friends later.

954
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:27,203
That's what I used to think,
but I was wrong.

955
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:30,139
Sometimes you just gotta reach out

956
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,208
and eat that cookie.

957
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,310
Oh, yeah.

958
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,515
Oh, wait. Mm-mm. Oh!

959
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,284
Do you like the cookies I made?

960
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,919
You made these?

961
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,855
Oh, my god, they're so...

962
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,924
I'm sorry,
I cannot lie to this face.

963
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,092
They're horrible.

964
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:51,494
What?

965
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,467
Ew, gross. Papa!

966
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,402
How is this my fault?

967
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:00,570
It was a mix.

968
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:13,583
Whew!

969
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,885
I've never seen you
quite so loose, brian.

970
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,088
What happened to that
tight grip you always had?

971
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,556
It's a lot more fun
when you let go.

972
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,292
Hmm.

973
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:24,761
Sara.

974
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,562
Yeah?

975
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:29,465
I wonder... oh, sorry.

976
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,035
Have fun.

977
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:34,337
- come on. All right, now.
What's this one?

978
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:37,206
Oh, I like that. I like that.

979
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,841
Honey.

980
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,877
What's the matter, honey?
You look upset.

981
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,279
It's just...

982
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:47,150
my patient, they almost died
during surgery.

983
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:49,085
I'm so sorry.

984
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,354
It's my fault. I...

985
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:52,655
I could have done
things differently.

986
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:53,790
I should... I should be better.

987
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,591
No.

988
00:44:55,694 --> 00:45:00,430
You are smart, kind,
and hardworking.

989
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:04,133
Maybe I don't say this enough,
but I'm proud of you,

990
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,568
and I always have been.

991
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,339
Thank you.

992
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,876
Did somebody spike the eggnog?

993
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:18,147
Not yet, but the night is young.

994
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:19,248
Yeah, go dance.
- You sure?

995
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:27,323
Today was a rough one for her.

996
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,325
She told me.

997
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:30,960
She thinks she's a bad surgeon.

998
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,696
- Ridiculous.
She's one of our best.

999
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:36,099
Her patient had a brain bleed
that no one caught

1000
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:37,700
until it was almost too late.

1001
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:40,503
She's too hard on herself.

1002
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,138
Good thing she has
a father like you,

1003
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,040
always looking out for her.

1004
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:51,748
Ok.

1005
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:57,019
Well, I had

1006
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:58,855
the most wonderful time
with you today.

1007
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,526
You are a great kid.

1008
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:05,461
Yep, my mom tells me all the time.

1009
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,998
Hey, why don't you go get
some candy canes, hon?

1010
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,000
Ok.

1011
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,135
I don't know
what's gotten into you,

1012
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:16,005
but thank you for watching harkin

1013
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,442
and for whatever medication
or food substitution

1014
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:20,877
that has somehow managed
to shift you

1015
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:23,312
from scrooge to santa.

1016
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:27,683
Santa is not the saint
some people think he is.

1017
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:29,852
Oh, really? You know this how?

1018
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,889
Let's just say he has
decked my halls several times,

1019
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,023
thank you very much.

1020
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,459
Oh, ok, well,
the next time you see him,

1021
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,728
tell him I said hi
and that I'm still waiting

1022
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,530
on that cabbage patch kid
he owes me.

1023
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:45,368
Speaking of things that are owed,

1024
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,436
I know I wasn't really around
for you that much

1025
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,906
when you were growing up,

1026
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,308
but I am here now,

1027
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,546
and I have a very special

1028
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,881
early christmas gift to give you.

1029
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:03,019
I have paid off your debts
and your student loans.

1030
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,992
How do you know
how much debt I have?

1031
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,295
Well, I happened to look
through your mail earlier.

1032
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,230
You looked through my mail?

1033
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,665
It was just sitting out,
and I thought...

1034
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:16,499
so you're spying on me?

1035
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,935
No, no, it's just...

1036
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:20,903
I wanted to do
something nice for you.

1037
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:21,871
I love you.

1038
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,340
I'm not a spreadsheet, dad.

1039
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:27,210
You can't just clear up
your debt by paying off mine.

1040
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,879
That's...
- What do you want then?

1041
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,914
I don't want your money.

1042
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,850
I just... I want a dad

1043
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,151
who doesn't have to ask me
that question.

1044
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,324
- Hey, come on. You ready?
- Ok.

1045
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,726
Let's go do all of our fun
christmas traditions, ok?

1046
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,431
I am gonna figure this out.

1047
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,765
You hear me, santa?

1048
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,968
I'm gonna make her happy,
and I'm gonna

1049
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,636
make her love me again.

1050
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:55,104
I'm gonna show you...

1051
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:04,347
oh, you sure showed me, huh?

1052
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,249
Just shut your chimney hole.

1053
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:11,487
Dr. Angeloni, I was hoping
you could do me a favor.

1054
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,256
Papa!

1055
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:14,590
- Harkin!
- I don't understand.

1056
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,092
That surgery's been
on the schedule for weeks.

1057
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:17,493
I don't need a day off.

1058
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,428
Yes, dr. Angeloni,
whatever you think is best.

1059
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,697
Of course, yeah.
I'll see you tonight.

1060
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,332
What's wrong?

1061
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,635
I was just coming here to ask
if you could watch harkin

1062
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,671
during my surgery, but it just
got taken off the schedule.

1063
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:29,872
I don't get it.

1064
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:31,474
I'm sure they have their reasons.

1065
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,542
Yeah, maybe dr. Angeloni
doesn't think I'm good enough.

1066
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:35,645
Well, I know for a fact
that's not true.

1067
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,880
Maybe they just wanted
to give you a little time off.

1068
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:41,050
Ok, well, we don't need
to bother you now.

1069
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:42,285
Why don't we get going?

1070
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,420
- No, no, no, wait, wait.
Please, please.

1071
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:45,855
Maybe we could spend
the day together.

1072
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,957
I could ditch work and...

1073
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,593
And we can go out and do
some of that christmas stuff

1074
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,428
that you guys always do.

1075
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,598
You'd ditch work
to do christmas stuff?

1076
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,200
Or other stuff, whatever you like.

1077
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:00,803
I want to go sledding
and sing christmas carols

1078
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,873
and bake cookies
and eat cookies and...

1079
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,708
that sounds like a great day.

1080
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:06,809
What is this? What's going on?

1081
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,277
Are you dying?

1082
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,012
I hope not.

1083
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,716
Look,

1084
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:17,320
I know you don't think
I know who you are

1085
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:19,588
or what you need.

1086
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,590
You're right.

1087
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:23,960
I was so busy trying
to give you a better tomorrow

1088
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,396
I wasn't in any of your todays.

1089
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,565
But I'm here now.

1090
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,101
Today is your day.

1091
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:33,669
Show me who you are.

1092
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,772
Ok.

1093
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:39,075
Ok.

1094
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:40,543
Where to?

1095
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,113
You'll see.

1096
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:46,048
Oh, and you'll need
different clothes.

1097
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:58,828
Ah. Thank you.

1098
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:02,264
Hi. These are really big.

1099
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:08,137
- there you are. Thank you.
Let's move on.

1100
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,705
You know,
that was actually kind of fun.

1101
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:10,873
- Yeah, you were amazing.
- Yeah.

1102
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:16,412
Yeah, jet.

1103
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,548
- Just wait a second.
- Yeah. Ok.

1104
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,686
Guys, I have to stop by the shop

1105
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,121
before we go ice skating.

1106
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:26,088
Why?

1107
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,256
Just a little work thing.

1108
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,691
A little work thing?

1109
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,826
Yeah, well,
there's this investor in town

1110
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,094
and I have to meet with her.

1111
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,429
You guys can play video games
while we wait.

1112
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,697
Yay!

1113
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:35,831
I thought you said
today was just about us,

1114
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,166
that you weren't going to work.

1115
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:38,567
I did say that,
but this just came up.

1116
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:39,902
Something always just comes up.

1117
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:41,203
Yeah, and how do you think I paid

1118
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:42,972
for all the donations
we just made?

1119
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:45,074
You have to earn your gifts
with hard work and sacrifice.

1120
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,676
When will you understand that?
- Oh, I do.

1121
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,112
I love my job and I have
sacrificed for my career,

1122
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,747
but never at the expense
of my family

1123
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:52,681
and never on christmas eve.

1124
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:54,316
Fine, I won't go.

1125
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,119
Maybe one day I'll be able
to forget all of the times

1126
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:01,123
that you chose work over me,
but today is not that day.

1127
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,263
I'm trying.

1128
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:09,231
Yeah, well, try harder.

1129
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,205
Jet, I'm not gonna make it.

1130
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:18,574
Oh, come on.

1131
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,449
I am not giving up.

1132
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,462
- there you go. Yep.
Looks really good.

1133
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:55,878
- For you.
- You can just...

1134
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,247
you know what... in his pipe
and smoke it.

1135
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,448
Do you remember
that music box you gave me

1136
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,916
when I was 12?

1137
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:34,917
The one with the clock on it?

1138
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,485
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1139
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:38,487
My dad found it at a yard sale.

1140
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,055
We fixed it together.

1141
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,891
It's a very valuable collectible.

1142
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:45,127
That's why you were so mad
at me when I broke it.

1143
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:47,530
Gosh, I begged you
to fix it for me,

1144
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:50,466
but you never had the time.

1145
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:53,569
I'm sorry.

1146
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,472
I got the time now.

1147
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,274
I gave it away years ago.

1148
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:09,451
All I ever wanted
was for you to love me.

1149
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:12,321
Oh, honey, I do love you.

1150
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,656
I always did.

1151
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:16,091
I wish I could believe that.

1152
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,994
It's just too late.

1153
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,963
You can't make up for lost time.

1154
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:21,997
What is it gonna take for me

1155
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,232
to prove to you that I love you,

1156
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:26,035
that I am ready
to be a good father,

1157
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:29,538
the kind of father who deserves
to be loved again?

1158
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,141
Can you go back in time
and fix that clock?

1159
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,980
I didn't think so.

1160
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,224
We'll just see about that.

1161
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:52,895
Well, that was a surprise.

1162
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,196
I didn't want to wait
another minute.

1163
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,664
I got it.

1164
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,766
I find that clock. I fix it.

1165
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,568
I give it to her,
then she knows that I love her.

1166
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,670
Then she loves me too.
And then I get to live.

1167
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,138
You see, I get it now.

1168
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,207
The meaning of christmas,
the meaning of life,

1169
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,343
it's love.

1170
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,612
My love, her love, harkin's love.

1171
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:10,913
Love is everything.

1172
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,248
You're right, it is.

1173
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,183
But there's something else
you should know about...

1174
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,451
Oh.

1175
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:18,220
Jet, I have
every confidence in you.

1176
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:20,656
You are my number one guy.

1177
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,058
Now, this was
a limited edition, and...

1178
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,426
I know they made
several of them, though.

1179
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:26,829
So you'll be able to find one,
and buy it,

1180
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,332
no matter what the condition
and no matter what the cost.

1181
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,167
Are you ok?

1182
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,335
This isn't like you.

1183
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,903
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1184
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:36,572
Oh, my god, are you dying?

1185
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:38,641
- Not today.
- Ok.

1186
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,243
Oh, and I need it
for the carnival tonight.

1187
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:43,379
Chop, chop.
- Yes, sir.

1188
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:44,947
- I'll text it to you.
- Ok.

1189
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,448
Ah, there you go.

1190
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,684
And this one.

1191
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,953
Oh, I have an idea for that one.

1192
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,755
We have something very special
for you, young man.

1193
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:57,926
Perfect.

1194
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,195
Hi.
- Hi.

1195
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,363
Really surprised me this year.

1196
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,299
So here you are, young man.

1197
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,401
This is great, yes.
- Sure to warm you up.

1198
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:06,835
Let me come around and help you.

1199
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,637
Come on. There you go.

1200
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,144
Oh, I needed this.

1201
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:16,578
Wow, I don't know why I don't have

1202
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:17,913
one of these in my office.

1203
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,316
- Can I have one?
- Sure, why not, kid?

1204
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:22,618
- Oh, no, dad.
She is eight years old.

1205
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,187
She doesn't need a massage chair.

1206
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,655
Have you watched the news lately?

1207
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:29,892
Climate change, inflation,
supply chain issues

1208
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,860
for pokémon cards.

1209
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:34,263
It's a very stressful time
to be a kid these days.

1210
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,198
She does have a point.

1211
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,534
You still don't need
a massage chair, ok?

1212
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,204
I wish this day would never end.

1213
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,673
Don't say that.

1214
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,076
Because then
christmas wouldn't come,

1215
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:50,479
and you'd miss
all those presents from santa.

1216
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,748
- Oh, right.
I've been very good this year.

1217
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,683
I'm going to get
a lot of presents.

1218
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,485
Oh, you really think so?

1219
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:03,859
It has been
a really wonderful day.

1220
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,829
It's been a long time
since I felt part of a family.

1221
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,465
I love you.

1222
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:10,466
Surprise!

1223
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,735
- Oh, nina. Hi.
What are you doing here?

1224
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:14,169
Well, jet told me you were busy,

1225
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,838
but he slipped up and said
you were at the store,

1226
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,208
so I thought I'd swing by
so we could talk business.

1227
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,111
I've run the numbers and I'm
super interested in investing.

1228
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,113
- Who is this?
- This is nina nishi.

1229
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,215
She's... she's...
Well, a possible investor.

1230
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:29,084
Gosh, I... I would love
to be in business with you,

1231
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,053
but today I promised my
daughter and my granddaughter

1232
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:32,321
that we would spend
the day together.

1233
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:36,225
And I've broken
a lot of promises in the past.

1234
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:37,993
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

1235
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,129
So I hope you understand.
- Wow.

1236
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,897
From everything I heard about you,

1237
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,967
this was not what I was expecting.

1238
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:48,570
You're very lucky to have
a dad that shows up for you.

1239
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:51,273
Yeah, I am.

1240
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,575
I'll talk to jet.

1241
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,211
We'll schedule something
for after the holidays.

1242
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:57,946
- Great.
- Wait, wait.

1243
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:00,849
Will you just wait...
Wait a second?

1244
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,819
Go, meet with her.

1245
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,087
- But honey, I...
- Listen, I know

1246
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:06,688
that the business
has been struggling.

1247
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,824
And harkin and I can just sit
in the massage chairs.

1248
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,260
Are you sure?

1249
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:12,861
Of course.

1250
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,632
I don't deserve
a daughter like you.

1251
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,100
Yesterday, I would have
agreed with you.

1252
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:21,503
But today... today, maybe you do.

1253
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,273
Go. We'll be right here.
- Ok.

1254
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,008
Nina?
- Yes.

1255
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,310
- All right.
- Thanks for waiting.

1256
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:30,412
Lower back.

1257
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:31,980
Whoa, that...
Yeah, that feels good.

1258
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,549
Oh!

1259
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:37,519
You know what I just realized?

1260
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,888
This is a christmas carnival,
and there's no games

1261
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,324
or prizes, and there's no santa.

1262
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:43,792
You should dress up
as santa, papa.

1263
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,127
Yes.

1264
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:46,228
That's never gonna happen.

1265
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,362
Please.

1266
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:49,298
A man must hold on
to some dignities,

1267
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,567
and not dressing as santa
is one of mine.

1268
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,569
Even the grinch
dressed up as santa.

1269
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,771
My father dressed as santa
every year.

1270
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,539
And I am not my father.

1271
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,174
I am no santa.

1272
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:00,642
If you say so.

1273
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,013
Want to get some snacks?
- Yeah.

1274
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,315
Let's go.

1275
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:08,984
Jet, where are you?

1276
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,219
If you're not here in ten minutes,

1277
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:12,154
I swear I'm gonna fire you.

1278
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:13,322
No, I don't mean it.

1279
00:58:13,424 --> 00:58:15,757
Just hurry!

1280
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,693
You know, I'm sick
of that martini.

1281
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:20,929
Just... may I have some gin
on the rocks?

1282
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:23,499
Make it a double.

1283
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,767
Merry christmas, brian.

1284
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,135
It isn't christmas
until tomorrow, is it?

1285
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:29,705
Sorry, I just wanted to...

1286
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:31,006
and tomorrow never comes, does it?

1287
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:32,841
It's always just today.

1288
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,344
Today, over and over again.

1289
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:38,280
And today is my last day.

1290
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:39,581
My last day.

1291
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,183
Do you understand?

1292
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:42,150
Are you ok?

1293
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:43,619
No, I'm not.

1294
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,754
I... I want more time.

1295
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,690
I have to get that clock,
that... that music box clock.

1296
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,793
That will get me to tomorrow,
which actually is christmas.

1297
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:55,998
- You're right.
It's not christmas yet.

1298
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,401
I hope you find everything
that you're looking for, brian.

1299
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,008
Who was that?

1300
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,443
It's just a ghost
of christmas past

1301
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:11,380
to remind me
what a horrible man I am.

1302
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:12,848
Why is there no santa
at this party?

1303
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,917
Papa has dignities.

1304
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,251
Ok.

1305
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,553
I've been thinking.

1306
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,454
I don't want to invest
in your company.

1307
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:20,622
Of course not.

1308
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,224
- I want to buy it.
- Buy it?

1309
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:23,392
Yes, the whole thing.

1310
00:59:23,494 --> 00:59:24,493
It's the only thing
that makes sense

1311
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:25,627
for me and for you.

1312
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,929
Just think,

1313
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:29,231
you won't have to worry about
money ever again,

1314
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,333
and you can spend
more time with your family.

1315
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:32,801
- Ok.
- Really?

1316
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,236
- Really?
- Really.

1317
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,838
But, dad, this company,
it's your whole life.

1318
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,140
Well, maybe it's time
it wasn't anymore.

1319
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,876
- I'm here! I've got it!
Please, don't fire me.

1320
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,811
- Jet.
- Finally.

1321
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,613
Michelle...

1322
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,415
mm-hmm?

1323
00:59:46,517 --> 00:59:49,318
I know I was never
the father you deserved.

1324
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,652
And you did deserve better.

1325
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,121
And I promise I'm going
to be better from now on,

1326
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:56,959
because I'm proud of you,
and I love you,

1327
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:01,296
and I hope this gift
shows you how much I care.

1328
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,399
It's a clock.

1329
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:06,368
- Yes, it's...
It's the music box clock

1330
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,936
I gave you when you were 12.

1331
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,304
Yeah, the one that you wouldn't

1332
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,739
help me fix when it broke.

1333
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,507
No, no... I know, I... I...

1334
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,443
But... but... but it's fixed now.

1335
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:15,911
I mean, I found a new one for you.

1336
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,379
I got this for you.

1337
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:21,249
Just open it.

1338
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,020
Thanks.

1339
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,923
You said that if I fixed it,
we could have a second chance.

1340
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:29,424
You said if I gave you this,

1341
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:30,859
it would prove that I loved you.

1342
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,062
I'm just gonna let
you guys talk in private.

1343
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:36,999
I never said that.

1344
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,500
Yes, you did, on the balcony.

1345
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:39,735
I've never been on the balcony.

1346
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,570
Yes, you were.

1347
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:42,971
I tracked it down today.

1348
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,907
And... and jet drove all over
town trying to find it.

1349
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,242
Oh, so jet got this for me.

1350
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,378
No, we... well, yes, but...

1351
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,813
it was a lot of driving,
all those last-minute shoppers.

1352
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:52,881
Well, thank you, jet.

1353
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,483
I appreciate your effort.

1354
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,753
Come on, honey.

1355
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:03,125
I'm guessing that didn't go
how you had hoped.

1356
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:05,594
I can fix this.

1357
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,329
Hey, everyone,
can I have your attention?

1358
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:09,097
Come on in here. Don't be shy.

1359
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,265
What is she doing?

1360
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:13,502
Hi. Merry christmas, everyone.

1361
01:01:13,604 --> 01:01:14,936
I just wanted to introduce myself.

1362
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,739
My name is nina nishi.

1363
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,841
And I just wanted to say thank you

1364
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:21,309
to our generous hosts,

1365
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:23,378
brian conway and pc electric,

1366
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,980
for all the hard work
they've done.

1367
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,314
Come on up here, brian.

1368
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:27,416
Come on up.

1369
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,418
Come on. Come on up.

1370
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,487
This man has worked so hard
over the years

1371
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,289
to build this company up

1372
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:35,757
and to give back to the community,

1373
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:39,294
which is why after all that
hard work and sacrifice,

1374
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,563
he's finally gonna reward himself

1375
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,665
by selling me the company.

1376
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,801
What did she say?

1377
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:47,069
What are you doing?

1378
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:48,370
I know we haven't
discussed the details,

1379
01:01:48,472 --> 01:01:50,005
but I'm just so excited,
I couldn't wait.

1380
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:53,909
And don't worry, I will be
a very generous boss,

1381
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:55,977
if and when I fire you

1382
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,512
after breaking the company
into pieces

1383
01:01:57,614 --> 01:01:59,047
and selling off the parts.

1384
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,382
This is not what we discussed.

1385
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:02,150
This is the only thing
that makes business sense.

1386
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,618
- Listen, everyone.
- Brian.

1387
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:04,753
There's been a misunderstanding.

1388
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,421
- But...
- No one is getting fired.

1389
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,824
Please, go back to the party
and enjoy yourselves.

1390
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:10,759
And you, just get out.
Go. Hit the bricks.

1391
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,463
Did you ask dr. Angeloni

1392
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:15,597
to take me off the schedule today?

1393
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,299
No.

1394
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,700
Ok, yes, yes, but only because...

1395
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,635
that patient almost died
during the surgery.

1396
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:21,770
If I had done the surgery...

1397
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,371
the same thing
would have happened.

1398
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:25,507
Well, thank you for having
faith in me as a surgeon.

1399
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:27,476
No, that patient had
a brain bleed.

1400
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,211
It doesn't matter who operated.

1401
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,079
What... what are
you talking about?

1402
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:32,647
You know what? I don't care.

1403
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,583
I thought you had changed.

1404
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:36,518
You sure fooled me.

1405
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,620
- You're right.
I wasn't there for you.

1406
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:39,621
I don't deserve you.

1407
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,389
I'm a horrible father.

1408
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:42,891
And I'm a horrible boss.

1409
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:45,761
And I'm a horrible human being.

1410
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,095
Oh, you're right.

1411
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:48,697
You're all right.

1412
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:54,870
Oh, my god.

1413
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:56,938
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Dad.

1414
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,573
I'm sorry.

1415
01:02:58,675 --> 01:02:59,908
I'm sorry.
- Papa.

1416
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,009
Hey, dad. Dad, hey. Hey.

1417
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,278
- Papa, papa.
- I'm sorry.

1418
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,381
- Are you ok, papa?
- Dad, stay with me, please.

1419
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:07,983
Papa.

1420
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:10,952
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

1421
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:21,346
I tried.

1422
01:03:21,448 --> 01:03:22,781
I know.

1423
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:27,018
The worst thing isn't that
I won't wake up tomorrow.

1424
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:28,820
It's that everybody else will.

1425
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,492
They'll wake up on christmas day

1426
01:03:33,594 --> 01:03:36,128
with the wreckage I left behind.

1427
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,531
A failing business.
My broken family.

1428
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:46,004
I wish I could have one more day,

1429
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:47,305
not that I could live any longer,

1430
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,574
but that they would be ok,

1431
01:03:49,676 --> 01:03:51,843
have the better life
I wasted so much time

1432
01:03:51,945 --> 01:03:54,146
trying to give them.

1433
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:57,048
I gave you 12 chances.

1434
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:58,550
I know.

1435
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,790
Or did you?

1436
01:04:05,893 --> 01:04:08,393
You've only given me 11 chances.

1437
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:10,162
It wasn't until
after the first death

1438
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:12,297
that you promised me 12 days
to get it right.

1439
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:14,199
Now, now, now, wait a minute.

1440
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:17,335
Please, give me that day.

1441
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,070
One more day.

1442
01:04:19,173 --> 01:04:21,806
Please, I can fix this.

1443
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:23,608
I know I can.

1444
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,944
I'll make a deal with you.

1445
01:04:26,046 --> 01:04:30,749
I'll give you
that one more day, but...

1446
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:34,819
Only to set things right,

1447
01:04:34,922 --> 01:04:36,755
not to keep living.

1448
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:41,459
When the day is done,
so is your life.

1449
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:45,030
Deal?

1450
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:50,235
I'll take it.

1451
01:04:58,445 --> 01:05:00,612
Merry christmas, brian.

1452
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:03,982
This looks...

1453
01:05:04,084 --> 01:05:06,618
Great, jason.

1454
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,752
Well, thank you, brian.

1455
01:05:10,724 --> 01:05:12,624
You think you could do me
a little favor?

1456
01:05:12,726 --> 01:05:13,725
Sure, I... I...

1457
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,560
I can try.

1458
01:05:19,533 --> 01:05:21,366
- whoa, whoa, whoa, be careful.
Slippery patch.

1459
01:05:21,468 --> 01:05:24,135
Bless you, sir.

1460
01:05:24,238 --> 01:05:25,103
Oh, please be careful.

1461
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:26,871
There's a slippery patch
right there.

1462
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:28,807
Merry christmas, folks.

1463
01:05:28,909 --> 01:05:31,576
- After you.
- Thank you.

1464
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,211
Merry christmas.

1465
01:05:36,216 --> 01:05:37,649
Good morning, mr. Conway.

1466
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:39,517
- It is, isn't it?
This is for you.

1467
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,486
Gingerbread latte
with extra cinnamon.

1468
01:05:41,588 --> 01:05:42,287
Your favorite, yes?

1469
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:43,588
How did you know that?

1470
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:46,658
How did he know that?

1471
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,094
All that is to say

1472
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,895
that even though it may not
have seemed like it,

1473
01:05:50,998 --> 01:05:54,633
I have been listening
and learning.

1474
01:05:54,735 --> 01:05:57,035
And you were right.

1475
01:05:57,137 --> 01:05:59,471
We should change our strategy.

1476
01:05:59,573 --> 01:06:03,041
If we... I mean,

1477
01:06:03,143 --> 01:06:06,144
if this company is to survive,

1478
01:06:06,246 --> 01:06:08,747
then we have to start
thinking about the future.

1479
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:11,116
Dale, that is why I am approving

1480
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,651
your new marketing
and branding campaign.

1481
01:06:12,753 --> 01:06:15,520
Really?

1482
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:16,721
But how are we gonna
pay for all this?

1483
01:06:16,823 --> 01:06:18,623
Well, I know
that nina nishi's in town,

1484
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:19,824
and she's interested in investing.

1485
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:22,827
I've scheduled a meeting
with her this afternoon.

1486
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:24,129
And something else.

1487
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:28,099
I would like to thank
each and every one of you

1488
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:31,603
for your years of devotion
and your hard work

1489
01:06:31,705 --> 01:06:35,774
by giving you all a 20% raise

1490
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:38,076
and a month's salary as a bonus.

1491
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:42,480
Oh, my god.

1492
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,082
Well done. Thank you, thank you.

1493
01:06:44,184 --> 01:06:46,017
Except for you, jet.

1494
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,255
You are getting
an even bigger raise

1495
01:06:50,357 --> 01:06:53,992
because I'm promoting you to coo.

1496
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,029
After all, you've been looking
after me and this company

1497
01:06:58,131 --> 01:07:01,266
for years, and if...

1498
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:03,601
If anything were to happen to me,

1499
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:05,970
I know pc electric
would be in good hands.

1500
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,907
I won't let you down, sir.

1501
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:10,208
Please, call me brian.

1502
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,176
Yes, sir.

1503
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,610
I mean, brian, sir.

1504
01:07:12,713 --> 01:07:15,213
I mean, brian.

1505
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:16,514
All right.

1506
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,216
You should work on that.

1507
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:19,617
Well, what are you all
sitting there for?

1508
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,821
It's christmas eve. Get home.
Start celebrating.

1509
01:07:22,923 --> 01:07:24,622
Oh, oh, and if you're
interested at all,

1510
01:07:24,725 --> 01:07:27,692
please come to the christmas
carnival tonight.

1511
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,694
Bring your families.
Bring your friends.

1512
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,296
It's gonna be fun.

1513
01:07:31,398 --> 01:07:34,032
Merry christmas.

1514
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,101
I have just a few last things
I'd like you to do

1515
01:07:36,203 --> 01:07:38,103
as my assistant,
if you don't mind.

1516
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:39,704
- Of course not.
- Ok.

1517
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:45,377
Now these, I want you to get
to the carnival for tonight.

1518
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,146
And these, I'd like to be
ordered and delivered

1519
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:49,414
to the house asap.

1520
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:51,716
I'm on it, brian.

1521
01:07:54,588 --> 01:07:56,721
Thank you.

1522
01:07:58,959 --> 01:08:00,959
- Papa!
- Harkin.

1523
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:04,229
What a wonderful way
to start the day.

1524
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:07,465
And how is my favorite
sunshine sparkle unicorn?

1525
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:09,200
Awesome.

1526
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:10,535
I have a surgery scheduled today,

1527
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:11,836
and the nanny just called.

1528
01:08:11,938 --> 01:08:14,439
Well, I can take care of her
while you work.

1529
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,508
- Really?
- Sure.

1530
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,675
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate

1531
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:19,144
this beautiful day
than to spend it

1532
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:20,578
with my awesome granddaughter.

1533
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,681
Great, ok.

1534
01:08:23,784 --> 01:08:24,949
Thank you. Thank you.

1535
01:08:25,051 --> 01:08:28,019
Oh, michelle, I can't
tell you how I know this,

1536
01:08:28,121 --> 01:08:30,455
but your patient, the one
you're about to operate on,

1537
01:08:30,557 --> 01:08:32,757
has a brain bleed
that no one has noticed.

1538
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:35,160
What are you talking about?

1539
01:08:35,262 --> 01:08:37,429
Just trust me.

1540
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:38,897
Go.

1541
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:40,031
Ok.

1542
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:41,533
I'll see you later, honey.
Thank you.

1543
01:08:41,635 --> 01:08:43,601
Ok. Bye, honey.

1544
01:08:46,306 --> 01:08:48,540
Ok, now, how would you
like to help me

1545
01:08:48,642 --> 01:08:49,774
with a very special project?

1546
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,709
You bet I can.

1547
01:08:51,812 --> 01:08:53,645
And that is gonna work
just like that.

1548
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:56,247
We'll put these screws in gently.

1549
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:57,849
And that will fit
right in there like so.

1550
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,684
- Right here.
- There you go.

1551
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:02,487
Now put a little pressure on it.

1552
01:09:02,589 --> 01:09:04,856
Nice job.

1553
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,825
Ok, I've got
this really quick meeting,

1554
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:08,159
but you... you sit here for a bit.

1555
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:10,762
If you need anything at all,
just come and get me.

1556
01:09:10,864 --> 01:09:12,831
You're the best papa ever.

1557
01:09:16,703 --> 01:09:18,670
I want to thank you for coming
on such short notice.

1558
01:09:18,772 --> 01:09:20,104
I know this seems out of the blue,

1559
01:09:20,207 --> 01:09:23,208
but I've realized recently
that time is precious,

1560
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:25,777
and I didn't want to wait.

1561
01:09:25,879 --> 01:09:30,048
Well, I have to admit
I was gonna contact you anyway.

1562
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:32,750
I have been following
your business for a long time.

1563
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:36,855
I... I didn't actually ask you
here to talk about business.

1564
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:39,724
Wait, I thought you were
gonna ask me to invest.

1565
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:40,992
I am.

1566
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,929
But first, I want to talk
a bit about life.

1567
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:48,333
I know what it's like
to want to be successful,

1568
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,902
to want to build something
that lasts.

1569
01:09:51,004 --> 01:09:53,104
But our work,
no matter how important it is,

1570
01:09:53,206 --> 01:09:57,408
must always be in support
of the life we live

1571
01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:00,311
and never in sacrifice to it.

1572
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:02,313
I do want you to invest
in pc electric,

1573
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:07,151
but only if it's part
of a life you want to live

1574
01:10:07,254 --> 01:10:09,888
and not an excuse to hide from it.

1575
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:12,156
You're not the person
I thought you would be.

1576
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:16,528
I'm not the person
I thought I was.

1577
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:20,265
Life is beautiful, right?

1578
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,400
You learn something new every day.

1579
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:25,637
Yeah.

1580
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:37,832
You were right.

1581
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,867
I ran some tests
and found the bleed.

1582
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,869
And we fixed it.

1583
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:43,671
The surgery was a success.

1584
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:45,607
Oh, that's wonderful, honey.

1585
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:55,516
I wish you could see
all the things I see

1586
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:57,585
when I look at you.

1587
01:10:57,687 --> 01:11:01,155
A brave, strong, smart,

1588
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:04,792
kind, generous woman.

1589
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:06,861
I'm sorry I wasn't around for
you when you were growing up,

1590
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:08,997
at least not the way
I needed to be.

1591
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:12,367
None of that was your fault.

1592
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:14,802
You deserved better.

1593
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:18,640
And I am sorry it took me
this long to figure it out.

1594
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,075
It's ok.

1595
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:22,710
You're here now.

1596
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,212
That's what matters.

1597
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,183
I heard there was free
hot chocolate in the cafeteria.

1598
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:30,652
Is that true?

1599
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,920
And why have you been keeping
this from me my entire life?

1600
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:35,690
Because I am a mean,
horrible parent,

1601
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,025
just like my dad here.

1602
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:40,895
Why don't we all go get a cup?

1603
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,331
You know, I have
a couple of final touches

1604
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:45,600
to put on the carnival
for tonight.

1605
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:46,734
Is it ok if you two meet me there?

1606
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:49,170
- Of course.
- Do we have to go.

1607
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:50,305
It's always so boring.

1608
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:52,273
What?

1609
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,176
What are you expecting,
some sort of wild and crazy

1610
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:56,577
christmas extravaganza?

1611
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,279
Yes.

1612
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:00,982
Well, then.

1613
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:04,919
I guess that's just what
we're gonna have to have.

1614
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:10,291
- He's so silly, huh?
- Yeah.

1615
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,744
Ho, ho, ho!

1616
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,113
You came.
I'm so happy you're here.

1617
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:34,549
Merry christmas.

1618
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:36,884
Well, the new boss.

1619
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:38,986
- Papa!
- Oh, honey!

1620
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:40,421
This is the best party ever.

1621
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,190
Oh, hi.

1622
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:43,524
It's just getting started.

1623
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:46,027
I thought I would never
see the day.

1624
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:50,665
Well, when you realize that
today is the only day you have,

1625
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:51,799
you have to make sure

1626
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,234
it's the best possible day
it can be.

1627
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:55,002
Ok, now I really don't know
what to think.

1628
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:56,337
What has gotten into you?

1629
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,638
Love!

1630
01:12:57,741 --> 01:12:59,507
And maybe a little bit
of that spiked eggnog.

1631
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:01,309
You should try it.

1632
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,477
Honey, I think it's time

1633
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,112
you finally showed me
that cartwheel.

1634
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:06,180
Ok.

1635
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:08,950
- Ta-da!
- Yeah! All right, well done!

1636
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,451
Let's get this party going.
Come on!

1637
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,652
Give me a ho, ho, ho!

1638
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:12,854
All: Ho, ho, ho!

1639
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,789
- Oh, hive me that ho!
Give me that ho!

1640
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,858
Ho, ho, ho!

1641
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,993
Santa needs a cocktail.

1642
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:21,729
Can I get a big can
of whipped cream?

1643
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:22,897
Hi.
- Hi.

1644
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:25,299
Hey, listen,

1645
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:28,302
I have been thinking
about what you said,

1646
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,205
about what I want from life.

1647
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:32,607
I was gonna buy your company,

1648
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,942
then break it into pieces
and sell off the parts,

1649
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:37,645
but I don't think
I want that anymore.

1650
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,414
What do you want?

1651
01:13:39,516 --> 01:13:41,616
I want to build a life
worth living.

1652
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:45,319
And I think pc electric would
be a good place to start.

1653
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:47,422
I agree.

1654
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:52,126
And when I'm gone...
When I'm retired,

1655
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,862
I know that you'll be there
to look after the company.

1656
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:55,997
Thank you.

1657
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,668
Oh.

1658
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,270
Of course.

1659
01:14:02,372 --> 01:14:03,471
Thank you.
- Cheers.

1660
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:04,772
Cheers.

1661
01:14:08,378 --> 01:14:09,310
It's good.
- It's good.

1662
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:10,378
- It's pretty good.
- Yeah.

1663
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,214
Merry christmas, brian.

1664
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,816
Merry christmas, sara.

1665
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:15,950
Wow!

1666
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:18,352
This is quite the party
you've thrown.

1667
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,655
I thought you hated christmas.

1668
01:14:20,757 --> 01:14:22,056
A man can change.

1669
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:24,225
How about you?

1670
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,327
Are you still
that open-hearted girl

1671
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:28,763
I so foolishly walked out on
all those years ago?

1672
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:31,632
Why don't you dance with me
and find out?

1673
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:42,243
Mm.

1674
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:43,811
Do you remember
that christmas I spent

1675
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:46,314
with you and your father?

1676
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,582
He and I got into a big fight,

1677
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:48,950
and I stormed out.

1678
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,017
Mm-hmm.

1679
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:51,786
Well,

1680
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:55,690
after you left,
we had a long talk.

1681
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:59,060
He told me that he knew
how he was too hard on you,

1682
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:02,663
that he always just wanted
what was best for you.

1683
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:05,066
He told me how proud of you
he was,

1684
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,034
how much he loved you.

1685
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:12,206
He loved you.

1686
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:15,743
I loved you.

1687
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,379
You didn't love yourself.

1688
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:19,714
I knew it.

1689
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:22,483
I knew you always loved me,
you just never told me.

1690
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:25,853
You're horrible.

1691
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,889
I know.

1692
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,524
Oh.

1693
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:32,460
Good evening, everyone.

1694
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,228
Thanks again for coming.

1695
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:37,031
Just a few short words before...

1696
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,634
It's all over.

1697
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:41,536
Pc electric is a family business.

1698
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:44,672
And honestly, I'd...

1699
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:47,375
I'd forgotten about the family
part for quite some time.

1700
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:48,709
You see, I was so busy
trying to live up

1701
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:51,145
to my father's memory

1702
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,581
that I'd forgotten
what really matters

1703
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,850
is making new ones.

1704
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:58,286
I see it now,

1705
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,888
the true meaning of christmas.

1706
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:02,990
Love.

1707
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:06,694
Love of family,
love of friendship,

1708
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:09,931
love of humanity.

1709
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:14,035
After all, christmas celebrates
the birth of a love so great

1710
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:16,604
that it just might save the world.

1711
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:20,775
Gosh, I... I never got that.

1712
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:23,878
You see, in my life,

1713
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:27,315
there was always one person
I could never love:

1714
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,449
Myself.

1715
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:32,987
I didn't think
I was worthy of love.

1716
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,190
But if I can't love myself,
then the love I give

1717
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,793
is worthless.

1718
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,095
Not anymore.

1719
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:44,999
So here's my christmas wish.

1720
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:50,171
I wish that all of you
could love yourselves

1721
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:53,908
as much as I love you.

1722
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:57,612
This has been
the best day of my life.

1723
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,747
Merry christmas!

1724
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:01,382
Merry christmas!

1725
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,657
Why you gotta go
and make me cry like that?

1726
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:15,830
Wow, you are just full
of surprises today.

1727
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:17,732
Oh, I've got a few more
for you too.

1728
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:18,866
You ready?
- Yeah.

1729
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,034
Let's go.

1730
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,102
All right, keep your eyes closed.

1731
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:22,470
- Ok.
- Eyes closed.

1732
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:23,738
- Where are we going?
- Eyes closed.

1733
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,039
- Where are we?
- Closed. Closed. Closed.

1734
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,941
- Come on.
- Keep them closed.

1735
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:29,110
I'll say when.

1736
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:30,344
All right, now...
- Uh-huh.

1737
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,380
Open them.

1738
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:33,981
I had a little help from a friend.

1739
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,853
- Dad.
- Too much?

1740
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:41,288
Never.

1741
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,324
- all right, come on.
Get on in there. Let's go.

1742
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:44,525
What did you do to the inside?

1743
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:45,660
Is it... did you also
put christmas in there?

1744
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:46,594
Oh, wait till you see that.

1745
01:17:49,148 --> 01:17:50,014
Here you go.

1746
01:17:50,116 --> 01:17:53,084
Oh, boy, look at these.

1747
01:17:53,186 --> 01:17:55,586
- Here are the cookies.
- My goodness.

1748
01:17:55,688 --> 01:17:58,155
Whoa, whoa, hey,
those are for santa.

1749
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,623
Yeah.

1750
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:01,892
Santa and I go way back.

1751
01:18:01,995 --> 01:18:04,195
He's not gonna mind.

1752
01:18:04,297 --> 01:18:07,565
Now, I want you two
to open these gifts.

1753
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:10,301
- No, it's christmas eve.
We always wait until morning.

1754
01:18:10,403 --> 01:18:11,268
New tradition.

1755
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:13,070
I like this new tradition.

1756
01:18:13,172 --> 01:18:16,507
That is my dad's tool belt.

1757
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,109
That way you'll know
you'll always have the tools

1758
01:18:18,211 --> 01:18:19,710
to fix anything in life.

1759
01:18:19,812 --> 01:18:20,811
Thank you, papa.

1760
01:18:20,913 --> 01:18:22,146
You're welcome.

1761
01:18:22,248 --> 01:18:23,114
Your turn.

1762
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:25,349
Ok. Ok.

1763
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:31,255
You remember that music box
I gave you when you were 12?

1764
01:18:31,357 --> 01:18:33,157
Yeah, the one I broke?

1765
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:35,259
The one I wouldn't fix.

1766
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:38,195
I wish I could go back in time

1767
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,631
and fix it like you asked me to.

1768
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:42,099
I wish I could go
back in time and fix

1769
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:44,702
a lot of things in my life.

1770
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:48,272
But I can't,
so I made you a new one.

1771
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:50,741
- I helped.
- Yes, she did.

1772
01:18:50,843 --> 01:18:53,277
I hope that you'll fill this one

1773
01:18:53,379 --> 01:18:56,047
with lots of good memories.

1774
01:18:58,084 --> 01:19:01,118
Open it.

1775
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:09,860
Our song.

1776
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:14,165
No matter what happens,
I love you.

1777
01:19:14,267 --> 01:19:15,499
I love you too.

1778
01:19:17,236 --> 01:19:19,070
Me too.

1779
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:22,706
Oh, come here.

1780
01:19:22,809 --> 01:19:24,108
Merry christmas.
- Oh.

1781
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:26,844
Merry christmas.

1782
01:19:26,946 --> 01:19:29,480
Now, you had better get to sleep

1783
01:19:29,582 --> 01:19:30,915
or santa won't come.

1784
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:33,684
Ok.

1785
01:19:33,786 --> 01:19:37,721
Thanks, dad, for everything.

1786
01:19:37,824 --> 01:19:39,990
Good night, honey.

1787
01:19:40,093 --> 01:19:41,592
See you in the morning.

1788
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:48,699
Merry christmas.

1789
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:27,471
And to all...

1790
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,473
A good night.

1791
01:20:49,028 --> 01:20:51,996
You figured it out.

1792
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,932
I did.

1793
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,834
Took me a while.

1794
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,170
Oh, it sure did.

1795
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:02,239
Oh, I was running out
of ways to kill you.

1796
01:21:04,911 --> 01:21:07,578
There may not be
such a thing as a good death,

1797
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,448
but at least now I can say
I lived a good life.

1798
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:16,487
You ready to go?

1799
01:21:16,589 --> 01:21:17,955
I am.

1800
01:21:21,761 --> 01:21:23,928
Santa?

1801
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,596
Yes?

1802
01:21:25,698 --> 01:21:26,864
Thanks.

1803
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,183
I'm alive.

1804
01:21:52,058 --> 01:21:55,059
I'm alive.

1805
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:56,860
It's christmas day.

1806
01:22:00,366 --> 01:22:03,334
Oh, my...

1807
01:22:03,436 --> 01:22:04,468
It's christmas day!

1808
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:06,570
Ah! I'm alive!

1809
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,439
Michelle! Harkin!

1810
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:10,140
It's christmas morning! Wake up!

1811
01:22:10,243 --> 01:22:11,475
- Oh, my goodness.
- Let's open presents!

1812
01:22:11,577 --> 01:22:12,409
Come on!

1813
01:22:18,884 --> 01:22:20,417
You know, I don't know
what's gotten into you,

1814
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:23,320
but I'm loving
this new version of you.

1815
01:22:23,422 --> 01:22:25,122
Me too.

1816
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:35,933
Big finish.

1817
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:44,708
That's terrible.

1818
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,144
This is the best christmas ever.

1819
01:22:47,246 --> 01:22:49,947
It is, indeed.

1820
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,349
- Yeah.
- Say, why don't we have

1821
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:54,285
a nice cup of hot cocoa?

1822
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:55,753
Oh.

1823
01:22:55,855 --> 01:22:57,521
Maybe put
a little irish whiskey in it.

1824
01:22:57,623 --> 01:22:59,323
Oh, yes, incredible. Yes.

1825
01:22:59,425 --> 01:23:01,258
- Aye.
- Oh, yes, aye.

1826
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,427
Wait,

1827
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:06,063
there's one more present.

1828
01:23:06,165 --> 01:23:07,731
I'll get that.

1829
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:10,301
That's interesting.

1830
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:13,637
To brian, from santa.

1831
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:14,738
Ok.

1832
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,807
Well, huh.

1833
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,878
Uh-huh.

1834
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,314
Told you I knew him.

1835
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:29,019
What is it, papa?

1836
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:32,056
It's a gift from an old friend.

1837
01:23:42,201 --> 01:23:43,600
Read the card.

1838
01:23:43,703 --> 01:23:45,202
Yeah.
