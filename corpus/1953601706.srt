00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,083
TEACHER: Okay, guys,
you might remember last week

6
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,375
I gave that great lecture on
Elvis Presley and the 1950s,

7
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,917
but today
we have to change gears

8
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:12,875
and talk about something
that's a little bit deeper,
a little harder to get at,

9
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,292
which is the
civil rights movement,
or the black freedom struggle,

10
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,708
or what some
historians have called
the second reconstruction.

11
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,625
Which I really like
because it ties it to
the first reconstruction

12
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,292
after the Civil War
to show that
there is a continuum,

13
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:30,167
there is a constant
struggle on the part of
African Americans in the south

14
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,042
to claim their freedom,
their liberty.

15
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,583
And, without a doubt,

16
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,625
uh, World War II really
provides the fuel for this,

17
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,250
that when you go
overseas to fight Hitler,

18
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,000
you get shot at,
you see your friends killed,

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,625
you're going to come home
a different person.

20
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,042
You're going to come back
a radicalized individual

21
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,583
willing to risk
life and limb.

22
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,167
So the Double V Campaign
during the war
is quite interesting.

23
00:03:56,167 --> 00:04:00,583
It stood for
victory at home
and victory abroad.

24
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,542
Defeat Hitler and fascism
and his racist policies,

25
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,792
but also defeat Jim Crow,
the racist south.

26
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,000
And they tried to do that,
but they needed some help,

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,208

of the most important...

1 Corinthians 10:13.

It says,
"But when you are tempted,
He will also provide a way out
