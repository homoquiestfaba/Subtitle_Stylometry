1
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,971
You all right?

2
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,267
Ron.

3
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,896
Are you okay?

4
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,438
How could somebody
do something like this?

5
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,361
Some gruesome stuff.

6
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:51,782
Yeah.

7
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,791
And just one town away.

8
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,126
Makes you wonder...

9
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,874
What's next?

10
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,171
Yeah.

11
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,462
What is this?

12
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,217
At least tell how it's gonna work.

13
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,847
All you need to know
is the air will burn.

14
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,638
The air will burn?

15
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,702
- Trial number four,
absolute perfection.

16
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,830
Yes!

17
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,607
Perfection!

18
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,058
Absolute perfection.

19
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,207
I'm gonna get you!

20
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:07,796
<i>' No'.!</i>

21
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:12,712
- Ron, do you have to get the kids
all riled up right at bedtime?

22
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:16,341
No, I don't have to.

23
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:17,571
I just want to!

24
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,182
Let's go, family prayer.

25
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,606
Cindy, Jason, come on.

26
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,108
Ron.

27
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,994
<i>All right, Ron, your turn.</i>

28
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,666
- I think we should have
Cindy say it tonight.

29
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,543
You never say it anymore.

30
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,389
I will another time.

31
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:06,440
- Dear God, thank You
for everything in the world.

32
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,857
Please keep us safe.

33
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,568
Please bless our blessings.

34
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,402
We ask that You
can watch over us,

35
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:16,991
that we can be a good family.

36
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,013
Did you get what you needed?

37
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,019
- What did I tell you
about you and your questions?

38
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,816
With liberty and justice

39
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,277
for all.

40
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,030
Very good, Rachel.

41
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,742
All right, who can tell me what number
President Thomas Jefferson was?

42
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,865
- Oh, me.
- I know!

43
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,219
Jason?

44
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:07,499
18?

45
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,334
- No, Thomas Jefferson
was number three.

46
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,752
- Oh, yeah,
that was my next guess.

47
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,838
- All right, children,
show me you know what to do.

48
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,182
Put the crayon down.
Come on.

49
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,266
If it was an emergency,
you'd stay low and crawl.

50
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,289
Hey, Max, this one for real?

51
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:36,313
Oh, it just went off again.

52
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,441
Stupid thing.

53
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,995
Hey, Dorsie!

54
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,937
Where's Penny?

55
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,145
Out being a teenager!

56
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,905
Come look at this.

57
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,156
What?

58
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,910
I'll get it in the morning.

59
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,584
I ask you to do one thing.

60
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,335
You keep this place running

61
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,374
while I take care
of the important stuff.

62
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,796
One thing!

63
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,162
Cunningham, it's David.

64
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:14,542
Yeah, I got your check.

65
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,503
Your investments about to pay off.

66
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,963
Get Parker,
be in Cokeville on the 15th.

67
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,586
Here comes the biggie.

68
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,075
Hey, what's up?

69
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,992
I got to figure this out.

70
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,035
I can't sit in there having everybody
tell me they got all the answers,

71
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,336
when every piece of scum just
keeps giving me more questions.

72
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,209
That body in the motel
last week...

73
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,630
Where are the answers
for that guy?

74
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,352
Love you, Dad.

75
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,516
- That's just too much of a coincidence
to just be a coincidence,

76
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,872
'cause I love you too.

77
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,194
Love you, Cinderella.

78
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,796
Penny, we're not leaving forever.

79
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,801
- Yeah, well, however long it is,
it's gonna seem like forever.

80
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,636
It's gonna be an adventure.

81
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,595
- Does it bother you
that I'm going to help him?

82
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,228
No, he's your brother.

83
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,314
Yeah, I know.
You should go help him.

84
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,728
Maybe it could give you some time
to think things through.

85
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,861
Look, Claudia, I-

86
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,034
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,679
I want us to be a close family.

88
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,247
Well, maybe you could start

89
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,660
by saying family prayers
with us again.

90
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,922
It's all the cop stuff
you see, isn't it?

91
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,426
- I just have a hard time
saying those praying things

92
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,964
when the world
I live in is filled with-

93
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,262
- Mom!
- In a minute, honey!

94
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,050
- It's already been
about a million minutes.

95
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,769
We'll talk when I get back.

96
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,308
I hope so.

97
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,773
Love you, Dad.

98
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,312
- That's just too much
of a coincidence.

99
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,596
I forgot how pretty it is here.

100
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,981
This'll be where we make our mark.

101
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,603
- It smells like somebody
already made their mark.

102
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,870
The dump?

103
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:44,752
Really?

104
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,712
We pull into town, and the first place
we hit is the dump?

105
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,377
Cut him some slack, Penny.

106
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:51,968
You know he's brilliant.

107
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,677
He just needs us to support him.

108
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,895
- Oh, look, he found us
an empty bottle.

109
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,982
Yeah, he is brilliant.

110
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,691
- Don't you think it's kind of weird
that he hasn't told us the deal?

111
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,995
They're here.

112
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,622
- David.
- Hey, David!

113
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,034
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

114
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,045
You got here okay?

115
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,462
Oh, yeah.

116
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,250
We're, uh, just excited
to get going.

117
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,002
Yeah.

118
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,505
Not long till you
see what you bought into.

119
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,348
They gave you money?

120
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,107
- Come on, David,
we're like kids at Christmas here.

121
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,021
- I'll tell you what] am ready
to let you in on.

122
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,741
I did it.

123
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,696
I've proven mathematically
how I can die and come back to life.

124
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,498
That is just fantastic.

125
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,807
He's been working on that for hours.

126
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:10,339
Yeah, that's really great, David.

127
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,836
But, anyways,
what's your big idea?

128
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,137
- Now, you're going to have
to wait till tomorrow

129
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:22,348
for the full business plan,
but for today, here's just a taste.

130
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:23,768
We're good with that.

131
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,938
- You ready, Dorsie?
- Yep.

132
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,396
You ready to see this, boys?

133
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:31,110
- Uh-huh.
- Let's see it.

134
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,285
Ready?

135
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,581
No!

136
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,045
Whoa! Whoa.

137
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,290
The air will burn.

138
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,047
<i>Whoa'.!</i>

139
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,964
- Now, just imagine
that times a billion, huh?

140
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,846
- So what, are we going
in the firework business?

141
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,555
- That's a good way
of looking at it, boys.

142
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,343
Fireworks is gonna take us
into the brave new world.

143
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:04,642
I told you.

144
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,436
He's one of the smartest guys
I've ever known.

145
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,315
- Did you see that?
We're going into the fireworks business.

146
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,041
All the way to the top.

147
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,515
That can thing part of the biggie?

148
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,529
- David, I got to tell you,
I am excited.

149
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,654
Big day.

150
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,490
So what's with the painted windows?

151
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,369
- I bet he's got to keep it cool
for the fireworks.

152
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,577
- Hey, thanks for everything.
- Anytime.

153
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,083
When's Dad get home?

154
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,674
This afternoon.

155
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,694
Are you all ready for your test?

156
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,952
- Yep, for sure.
- Oh, good.

157
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:25,139
So you know all about Wyoming?

158
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,519
Okay, what is the capital of Wyoming?

159
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,268
. Easy.?

160
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,897
It's W.

161
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,313
Jason.

162
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,695
- Got to go, Mom.
- Love you.

163
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,736
Love you.

164
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,149
Be safe at school!

165
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,402
Pull over right here.

166
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,214
This...

167
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,857
This is the day we lead people
into the brave new world.

168
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:05,012
Our enforcer has been outfitted
with five blast caps

169
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:10,304
placed in cans filled
with gunpowder, aluminum dust, flour,

170
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,898
and it will explode
in the air like confetti.

171
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,645
The gas will explode
on a delayed fuse,

172
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,358
Which will ignite
the particles in the air,

173
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:22,113
and the air will bum.

174
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,573
Walls will collapse,
and everybody inside

175
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:29,368
will immediately move as reincarnate

176
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,786
to a world I preside over.

177
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,332
Hold on.

178
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,165
What walls collapse?

179
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,044
Who's inside?

180
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,173
The chosen ones.

181
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,461
The children
of Cokeville Elementary School.

182
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:45,386
No, really.

183
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,472
What's the plan?

184
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,599
This is a religious community.

185
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,934
They'll do whatever it takes
to get their children back.

186
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,270
No, really.

187
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,246
What's the plan?

188
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,149
This is the plan.

189
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,731
Blowing up little kids is the plan?

190
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,900
It's a good plan.

191
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,033
12-4 to base.

192
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,789
Go for base.

193
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,708
Yeah, Nadene, anything going on?

194
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,293
Well, with you two cops out of town,

195
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,126
I can finally get
some work done around here.

196
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:21,715
10-4.

197
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,417
Come in!

198
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:41,901
Come in!

199
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,865
They're going back in.

200
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,744
The biggie's about to happen.

201
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,457
Daddy, what are you gonna do?

202
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:25,483
You just do as you're told.

203
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,950
You ready?

204
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,215
David, does this have anything to do

205
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,218
with when you
were the town marshal here?

206
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,973
The air will burn.

207
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,309
I'll be back in about an hour.

208
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,383
- One more mess-up,
and I'll shoot you.

209
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,541
Hello.

210
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,171
- Miss Cook, we're holding
the school hostage.

211
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,103
Don't push any alarms.

212
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:50,965
Don't call for help.

213
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,982
We have guns, and this is a bomb.

214
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:56,929
I need just pull this trigger,

215
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,183
and this building,
with everybody inside of it,

216
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,226
will be blown sky high.

217
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,185
Try and hit me over the head
or anything like that,

218
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,560
and I will pull this trigger
when I go down.

219
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:11,733
Do I make myself clear, Miss Cook?

220
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,114
Stop!

221
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,743
Get over here.

222
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,222
Get over here!

223
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,541
Are you crazy?

224
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,331
I can't believe you would do this
to little kids!

225
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:32,129
I am not going to do this.

226
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,473
Keys.

227
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,562
Get out of here!

228
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,030
You're no daughter of mine,
no daughter of mine!

229
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,998
It was so tempting

230
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,043
that Goldilocks
set about helping herself.

231
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,208
First she tried a spoonful
from Papa Bear's great, big bowl.

232
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:15,380
"Ow! " she yelled.
"Too hot!"

233
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,882
Next, she tried a spoonful from
Mama Bear's medium-sized bowl.

234
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:24,016
"Brr, too cold. "

235
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:29,182
Finally, Goldilocks tried a spoonful
from Baby Bear's tiny, little-

236
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,063
What exactly are you doing here?

237
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:37,404
Quiet, lady.

238
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,191
You've got to be joking.

239
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:40,407
This is my room.

240
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,951
No, this is my room.

241
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,159
Now sit down and shut up.

242
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,907
- Follow me.
I have a surprise for you.

243
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,621
What kind of a surprise?

244
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,332
Come and see.

245
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,295
- Is it a birthday?
- Yeah.

246
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,460
Come to room 4
for a special surprise in room 4.

247
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,717
Come on.

248
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,311
Carson, wait for Mommy!

249
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,099
Sweetie, Mommy will be
right back, okay?

250
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,157
- Good. Come right on in.
Thank you.

251
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:03,822
- Hi, Ashton.
- Sit down.

252
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,326
Hello, hello, hello.

253
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,114
Thank you.
Come right in.

254
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:09,998
Come in.

255
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,421
- What is this?
- Sit down, please.

256
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,466
Hello, thank you.

257
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:25,554
Welcome.

258
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,889
Go to the back.
Sit down. Be quiet.

259
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,287
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Gracie.

260
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,416
- Do you know where
Carson's class is?

261
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,708
Urn...

262
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,226
they might be in room 4.

263
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,280
Okay, let's go to room 4.

264
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:01,300
How you doing, Pal?

265
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:07,548
There's your friends.

266
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,229
Come in.

267
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,062
Oh, no, I've got to go.

268
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:20,106
No. Come in.

269
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,973
You may want to stay.

270
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,125
We have a problem here.

271
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,548
What's going on?

272
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,472
- Help me! Help!
Help, please, somebody!

273
00:25:56,507 --> 00:25:58,395
Somebody, I need some help!

274
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,857
Please, please, some-

275
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,940
Please, I need to talk
to a police officer!

276
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:03,402
This is very important.

277
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,859
- There's no officers here right now,
but I can help you.

278
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,196
Please, you need to listen to me!

279
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,326
Something very bad is gonna happen
if we don't talk to the police!

280
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,366
No, listen to me.
I need to talk to the police.

281
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:12,619
What is wrong with you?

282
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,952
Why won't you get me
a police officer?

283
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,495
Miss, what's the trouble?

284
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,541
Listen to me.

285
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,206
My dad has a bomb,
and he's gonna blow up the school.

286
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,711
If you don't believe me,
come out to my van!

287
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,949
- Hey, we didn't know
what he was gonna do!

288
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:37,805
- He's gone crazy!
He used to be real smart.

289
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,530
<i>' Tina?</i>

290
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,419
These are all mine.

291
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,289
Missiles ahoy.

292
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:05,089
Here I come.

293
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,673
Beep, beep, beep.

294
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,789
What's going on here?

295
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:18,602
Are you the principal?

296
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,436
- Yes, I'm the principal.
What's going on here?

297
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:26,654
This is what's going on here.

298
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,696
David Young?

299
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,656
- Just your old town marshal
here for a friendly visit.

300
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,919
- Barn, bam, bam, bam, bam,
ham, barn, barn, barn, barn, barn.

301
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,338
Yes, sir.

302
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,298
What is it you want?

303
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,758
- Bam, bam,
barn, ham, bam, barn, barn, bam.

304
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,222
<i>' Shut</i>

305
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,934
I am sick and tired of all this noise!

306
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,599
This is the most important day
of my life,

307
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:04,191
of our lives!

308
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,943
So shut up and let me focus.

309
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,173
And give me some space!

310
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,754
I want you to go back to your office.

311
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,674
Call the authorities.

312
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,590
Tell them I want $2 million
for each child.

313
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:42,810
Tell them I'm prepared to stay here
for ten days,

314
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:44,602
if necessary.

315
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,771
It might take Congress that long
to raise all that money.

316
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,398
And if you're not back in 15 minutes...

317
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,176
I'm gonna start shooting...

318
00:28:58,211 --> 00:29:00,201
Shooting.

319
00:29:00,236 --> 00:29:04,293
One by one.

320
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:10,000
Anybody runs out, I shoot a kid.

321
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,685
Listen, kids, do as you're told.

322
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,102
Keep quiet.

323
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,139
Everything will be all right.

324
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,652
Max...

325
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,987
it's gonna be
a brave new world.

326
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,114
Max, the brave new world

327
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:45,076
is basically the idea
of reincarnation.

328
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:46,208
Hey!

329
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,837
Let the authorities know.

330
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:55,803
- Kids, this is an experience
you'll all tell your children

331
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:59,012
and your grandchildren all about.

332
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:03,473
So let's get out
some paper and crayons,

333
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:05,846
and it'll all be nice in here.

334
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,610
- Nadene, there's a mad man
here at the elementary school.

335
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:16,863
He's got a-
- We know.

336
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,321
- We've been notified.
- How could you know?

337
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,886
- Teachers, we need
each of you to count up

338
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,175
how many children you each have
from each of your classrooms.

339
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,437
Yes?

340
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,770
- You're not supposed
to say the same word so many times

341
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,109
in a sentence.

342
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,194
"Each. "

343
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:00,484
You said "each" three times
in the same sentence.

344
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,134
I have 18.

345
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:23,672
10.

346
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,140
15.

347
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,927
- 14.
- 15.

348
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:28,554
12.

349
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:30,103
14.

350
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,482
That's 98.

351
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,152
That's right.

352
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,152
Base to 12-4.

353
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,784
Base to 12-4?

354
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,789
Ron, we have a situation
down at the elementary school.

355
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,621
Base to 12-4.

356
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,520
- Hey, mister,
I was looking at your guns.

357
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:10,977
Pretty cool guns,

358
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:15,188
but why didn't you get an AK-47?

359
00:32:15,223 --> 00:32:18,819
AK-47?

360
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,856
That would be illegal.

361
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,687
- How long do you plan
on being here for?

362
00:32:39,722 --> 00:32:43,254
- I don't know.
Two days, three, ten?

363
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:45,011
Excuse me, ma'am.

364
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,156
Um, I left my baby in the car,

365
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:50,835
and I need to go out and get her.

366
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,437
You left your baby in the car?

367
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,271
- I know, I know. I thought
I was gonna be just a second.

368
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:57,441
Let me tell you something.

369
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,777
You never leave a child like that.

370
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,613
- Please, just let me go get her,
and I'll bring her right back in here.

371
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:07,409
I promise.

372
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,742
You're not going anywhere.

373
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,247
Are you a mother?

374
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,265
Because if you were, you would unders-
- Sit down.

375
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,248
- Please, just can we just talk and-
- Sit down!

376
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,595
- Like a brave new world-
- Okay, all right.

377
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,678
- He told us we were gonna start
a fireworks business.

378
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,140
- Nadene, you better start
calling some parents.

379
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,277
Hello?

380
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:01,797
Hello?

381
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,838
Glenna, the kids are in trouble.

382
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,680
What kind of trouble?

383
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,071
- She has no one
to take care of her.

384
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,734
- I don't even think
she has a kid in the car.

385
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,953
- Excuse me again.
I, uh...

386
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,870
I was just thinking,

387
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,125
maybe you could send
somebody else to go get her?

388
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,664
No.

389
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,924
- Okay, well, then could you
just go get her?

390
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,799
Please?

391
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,337
She's my baby.

392
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,224
Thank you.

393
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,136
It's a gold sedan,
and it's parked in the drop-off,

394
00:34:56,171 --> 00:34:58,138
and she's in a car seat.

395
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,733
- Hey!
- Shh.

396
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,360
- I want you to stack
some tables and chairs

397
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,116
and make a barricade
so nobody can go through there.

398
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,429
Why can't we just shut the door?

399
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:17,082
'Cause the bathrooms right there.

400
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,121
Kids.
Bathroom.

401
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,047
- Nadene, I've got to get
a truck over there right now.

402
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:34,611
You better let the clergy know too.

403
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,267
Hello?

404
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,105
At our school?

405
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,623
Oh, it's all right.

406
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,081
It's okay, it's okay.
Come here.

407
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,683
Get that off.

408
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:05,796
You come with me?

409
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,839
Big jump. Come on.

410
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,253
Your mommy was bad.

411
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,640
Verlene...

412
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,269
I've read about this kind of thing.

413
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,978
If he starts to sweat,

414
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,187
that's when we're in real trouble.

415
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,778
We can't just sit here.

416
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:35,076
We've got to do something.

417
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,045
Oh.

418
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,917
Give her to me.

419
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:50,715
Oh, sweetie.

420
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,252
Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,302
You're okay.

422
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,385
I'm sorry I left you.

423
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,915
Mr. Young?

424
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:32,176
The children are getting sick
from the smell of gas.

425
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,511
Can we take it out of here?

426
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,141
Can we at least open the windows?

427
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,415
Look, this could cause you real trouble

428
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,527
as more and more
of these kids get sick.

429
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,199
At least for now,
they're doing what they're told,

430
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,319
but if they all get sick...

431
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,701
<i>Do it.</i>

432
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,537
But listen, don't you try nothing.

433
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,063
These children are precious.

434
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:14,339
I'll only shoot them with a .22.

435
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,347
This is a .45.

436
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,635
This is for the teachers.

437
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,646
Your lives don't mean a thing to me.

438
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,039
And your principals
got one minute to get back,

439
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,203
or I start shooting.

440
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,432
- The way he's got this bomb triggered,
I don't know what to do.

441
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,267
- What do you think he wants?
- I don't know what he wants.

442
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,262
I don't know if he knows what he wants.

443
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,735
One minute he's talking
about wanting money.

444
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,445
The next he's ranting about this bomb
creating his brave new world.

445
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,566
What's that?

446
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,071
- Ben said it's something
to do with reincarnation.

447
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,119
Got to go.

448
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,056
I'm here! I'm here!

449
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,142
I told them.

450
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,764
Now what?

451
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,849
Now the White House.

452
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,861
Base to 12-4.

453
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,287
Go for 12-4.

454
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,700
- Ron, we have a situation
down at the elementary school.

455
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:11,082
How far out are you?

456
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,915
- About two hours.
What kind of situation?

457
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,714
- Some lunatic
has taken over the school.

458
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:18,464
The elementary?

459
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,127
- He's demanding a ransom.
That's all we know.

460
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:22,468
Are my kids in there?

461
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,050
Nadene, the FBI's on the line.

462
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:26,220
- Nadene!
- Got to go.

463
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:28,057
Oh.

464
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,311
He better not touch my kids.

465
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,670
- I hope we're not gonna have
any trouble.

466
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:06,903
Your breath smells like Peaches.

467
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:10,101
Well, I haven't been eating any.

468
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:12,437
Peaches is my dog.

469
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,276
- Hey, kids, kids,
we're going to play a game.

470
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:26,991
Kids, hey.

471
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,953
Come on, sweetie.

472
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,761
- I'm gonna make a square,
a magic square.

473
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:35,500
- What's a magic square?
- What's that?

474
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,835
And no one is allowed
inside this magic square

475
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,504
except Mr. Young...

476
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,094
And Doris.

477
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,014
Back up, guys.
Give me some room.

478
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:54,979
Back up.
Give me some room.

479
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,187
Can you give me some help?

480
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,402
Okay.

481
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,038
- Mr. Robbins,
what happens if somebody

482
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:21,460
goes inside the magic square?

483
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,918
<i>Then, uh...</i>

484
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,506
They're out of the game.

485
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,016
Okay, let's get a desk
for Mr. Young to sit on.

486
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,476
Oh, yeah, everyone will know.

487
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:04,875
Have you guys been on TV before?

488
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,093
You will now.

489
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,635
Hey, lady'?

490
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,924
Is this your first time
kidnapping helpless, little children?

491
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:15,518
Yeah, it's my first.

492
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:17,471
But David...

493
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:19,353
<i>Oh...</i>

494
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,062
he has lots of great ideas.

495
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,320
Even better ones than this?

496
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,656
Yeah?

497
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,944
But why are you doing this?

498
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,552
- Well, my brother
is really sick in a hospital,

499
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:40,201
so we're gonna send them money
so they'll keep

500
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:42,374
taking care of him
so he can get better,

501
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:43,997
so he can-

502
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,467
Four "so"s.

503
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,353
Do not try to enter the school.

504
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:05,317
Stay back.

505
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,567
The police will be here shortly.

506
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,947
Stay back.

507
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,361
It will only hurt your children
to push past barricades

508
00:44:14,396 --> 00:44:16,454
and go into the school.

509
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:22,328
Teacher, are we going to die?

510
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,543
- We can't die.
We're just little kids.

511
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,218
I'll be right back, loves.

512
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,937
Mr. Young?

513
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,363
Mr. Young, I have
a proposition for you.

514
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,165
You can keep me.

515
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,999
You can shoot me
to make your point.

516
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:07,170
I'm fine with that.

517
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,084
But would you please
let the children go?

518
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,465
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep them safe, Mr. Young.

519
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,971
Mr. Young?

520
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,228
- The best thing you can do
for these kids, lady,

521
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:31,980
is sit down and shut up.

522
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,116
How can a genius think around here?

523
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,166
What do you want?

524
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,626
Back off, little man!

525
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,842
Come on, Jason.

526
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,079
Oh, you're all sweaty.

527
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:09,438
Help me get this off.

528
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,725
The commissioner's here.

529
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,059
- Nadene.
- Hey.

530
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,188
- Now, I understand
this guy wants money.

531
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,933
I'm ready to write him out a check.

532
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,900
How much does he want?

533
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,484
$200 million.

534
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,739
Say again?

535
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:10,086
$200 million.

536
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,299
For those kids,

537
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:20,305
I'll sell my entire ranch
if I have to, but...

538
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,766
I don't have-
- I know.

539
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,434
I know.

540
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,517
The whole town couldn't.

541
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,074
Hey, Billy, watch this.

542
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,219
Magic foot in the magic square.

543
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,387
Do you think this is funny'?

544
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:13,141
Do you think this is a game?

545
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,571
Go ahead and try it again.
We'll see who wins the game.

546
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,776
Try it, big man!

547
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,534
Try it

548
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,197
- Hey, hey, he doesn't understand.
He's just a little kid.

549
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:29,532
Shh, keep it down.

550
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:30,790
- Hey.
- Shh.

551
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,544
It's all right, sweetheart.

552
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,174
<i>I...</i>

553
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,088
I got to get out of here for a minute.

554
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,466
Oh.

555
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,183
I'm gonna put this on you.

556
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:54,224
You can only move your hand
about this far.

557
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:55,981
Okay.

558
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,814
Don't even scratch your nose.

559
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,280
When I come back,
this is all gonna end.

560
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,330
Mrs. Young, do you have children?

561
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,757
A child kind of opens up
your ability to care for others,

562
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:07,096
don't you think?

563
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,557
Oh, it sure did for me.

564
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:15,847
- Would you want your child subjected
to this kind of terror?

565
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,210
I can tell you're a good person.

566
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:25,238
This wasn't your idea, was it?

567
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,911
- Sometimes you just got to do
what it takes to keep the peace.

568
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,748
This is keeping the peace?

569
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,048
David is a visionary.

570
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,132
He's brilliant.

571
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:50,014
He figured out with a calculator
how to die and then come alive again.

572
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:51,257
Amazing.

573
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,468
What a mind.

574
00:50:54,503 --> 00:50:55,935
Okay, then...

575
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,847
so don't get critical.

576
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,522
Forgive me.

577
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,276
I think it's the gasoline.

578
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:07,947
I...

579
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,130
I've got just such a headache.

580
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:12,278
- Oh, me too. I...

581
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:27,341
Children, go!

582
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,380
Children, stay low.

583
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:31,595
Get up!

584
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,113
Stay away from the flames!

585
00:51:54,148 --> 00:51:56,826
Kids, kids, come to me!

586
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:59,117
Children, go!

587
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,047
Get down! Get down!

588
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:11,045
Go! Go!

589
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,104
- I can get you out.
Kids, come over here!

590
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,022
Stay away from the flames!

591
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,900
<i>' Go, go!</i>

592
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,589
- Kids, get away from the building!
Run!

593
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,675
- Hey, look, when I get there-
- It went off.

594
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,891
The bomb went off!

595
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,080
12-4 to base!

596
00:53:03,115 --> 00:53:06,482
12-4 to base!

597
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,940
Nadene, you got to talk to me!

598
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,869
How could You let this happen?

599
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,872
'Cause You're not even there.

600
00:53:28,678 --> 00:53:30,322
Hurry, hurry, get out.

601
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,495
Are there any children
left in the room?

602
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,955
If there are any kids in the room,
come to me.

603
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,952
Kids, follow my voice.

604
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:08,293
Oh, come on.

605
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,080
Gather on the far lawn!

606
00:54:10,115 --> 00:54:13,004
On the south lawn!

607
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,539
<i>Jase, you doing okay?</i>

608
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:56,844
Honey, do you want
anything to eat at all?

609
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,765
Cindy's doing okay,

610
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,476
but he isn't coming out of it.

611
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:09,766
He just keeps watching
that cop show over and over.

612
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,188
- Give him some time.
- Ron, he needs help.

613
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,197
I'll see what I can set up.

614
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,333
It's my fault.

615
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,255
No child should be subjected
to that kind of terror.

616
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,041
I should've been there to protect them.

617
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:39,551
Where was I?

618
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,088
Try it, big man!

619
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,811
Mr. Hartley?

620
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,348
Are you all right?

621
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,103
He's been in there a long time.

622
00:55:56,138 --> 00:55:58,526
Almost two hours.

623
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,569
Should I be worried?

624
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:12,127
Mr. Hartley?

625
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,129
How's he doing?

626
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,465
Well, that's a good question.

627
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,300
I think you and Jason need to sit down
and have a nice, long talk.

628
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,061
- Yeah, you're right.
He's a good doctor.

629
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,445
Why don't you go play for a minute?

630
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,778
I'll grab your mom,
and then we'll talk, okay?

631
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:44,947
Okay.

632
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,182
- Hey.
How did it go?

633
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:56,456
Oh, it went great.

634
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:02,508
I guess there's a few things
he hasn't been telling us,

635
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:04,845
so I think it's time we have a talk.

636
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,226
- Ron, don't interrogate him
like he's a suspect.

637
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:17,686
Jase, the doctor
said that we should talk.

638
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,693
Do you know why he said that?

639
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,703
Don't you want to talk to us?

640
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,010
It's just-

641
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:32,623
I'm scared.

642
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,912
Don't be scared, honey.

643
00:57:34,947 --> 00:57:37,167
You can tell us anything.

644
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:44,003
- It's about that day
with the mean guy.

645
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,137
Okay.

646
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,515
Well, the thing is,
what I didn't tell you

647
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,475
was that there were other people
in the room with us.

648
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,314
You mean the teachers?

649
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,896
What other people?

650
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,818
The ones all in white.

651
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,910
One was a lady.

652
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:15,248
She stood by me.

653
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,207
She said that what those people
were doing was very bad

654
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:20,879
and that the bomb was gonna go off.

655
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,669
She said if I stood by the window,
everything would be okay.

656
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,547
So she helped you?

657
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,055
Did she tell you her name?

658
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,806
- But I think it
was Grandma Meister.

659
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,611
- Jase, Grandma Meister
lives in Pinedale.

660
00:58:42,646 --> 00:58:44,730
She wasn't at your school that day.

661
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,076
Okay.

662
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,720
That's Grandma Meister.

663
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,535
That's her.

664
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,449
That's the lady you saw?

665
00:59:36,484 --> 00:59:38,746
That's my angel.

666
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,303
- I think that's just too much
of a coincidence

667
00:59:49,338 --> 00:59:51,672
to be a coincidence.

668
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:58,854
- Jase, why didn't you
tell us about this before?

669
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,434
- 'Cause I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

670
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,953
What do you think?

671
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,545
You don't want to know what I think.

672
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,388
Say it.

673
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,896
I'm just not buying his angel story.

674
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:45,772
I think it's his coping mechanism.

675
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,359
- You don't believe our own son?
Y

676
01:00:50,394 --> 01:00:53,534
- You know how I think.
I need proof.

677
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,743
- So you treat your son
like a criminal?

678
01:00:58,778 --> 01:01:01,160
That's how it works.

679
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:03,543
I'm trained that way.

680
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,627
Well, then go find your proof.

681
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,711
Maybe Jason wasn't the only one.

682
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:17,383
You're the sheriff's investigator.

683
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:20,056
Look into it.

684
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,643
Okay.

685
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:28,565
I'll pay some visits around town,
see what I can come up with.

686
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,363
Anything at all?

687
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,949
Anything out of the ordinary?

688
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,742
- Well, the first thing
I'd tell you is the fact

689
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,116
that the fire alarms went off
for no reason a couple of times

690
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:44,455
in the days just before the bombing.

691
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,140
Those alarms prepared
the kids in a big way.

692
01:01:47,175 --> 01:01:49,754
They learned to get
out of a room quickly,

693
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,713
to stay low, to crawl
if they needed to find air,

694
01:01:52,748 --> 01:01:55,637
but nobody knows
why the alarms were going off

695
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:59,181
or why now they've just stopped.

696
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:03,016
And then I'd look at that business
about the magic square.

697
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:06,396
If Ben hadn't been prompted
to put that down,

698
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,810
there would've been kids right up
next to the bomb when it went off.

699
01:02:09,845 --> 01:02:12,483
They'd have ended up just like Doris.

700
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:17,868
- But don't you think
that's just coincidences?

701
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,785
Maybe.

702
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,369
But I don't think so.

703
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:32,841
- Then I saw Rich Haskell.
He's the bomb expert.

704
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:34,549
Hartley, when that bomb went off,

705
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,801
there shouldn't have been
any survivors,

706
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,552
but then there wasn't near as big
an explosion as there should've been.

707
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:44,269
One big factor was that the meat-head
just happened to choose a milk jug

708
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:46,684
as the container to put the gas in...

709
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:48,808
a container that leaked.

710
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:53,486
Now, the fumes that it gave off
got them to open the windows.

711
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,230
Can we at least open the windows?

712
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:57,948
<i>Do it.</i>

713
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,719
He let them keep the doors open.

714
01:03:00,754 --> 01:03:03,411
'Cause the bathrooms right there.

715
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,245
- Those openings created
a vent for the blast.

716
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,668
Also, the leaking gas
ran down into a can

717
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,877
that he had filled
with aluminum particles and flour.

718
01:03:12,912 --> 01:03:15,091
They were designed
to shoot into the air on fire,

719
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,467
creating an even bigger explosion.

720
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,130
It would've been
like the air was on fire.

721
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:21,680
Now.

722
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:24,514
- But with it wet,
it couldn't happen.

723
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:26,935
See, those things I understand,

724
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,440
but there were just too many things
that I cannot explain,

725
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:33,692
like only two of the five
blasting caps went off.

726
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,106
The wires that were set to trigger
the other blasting caps were cut.

727
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:40,024
They weren't pulled out,
they weren't ripped,

728
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:42,907
but cleanly cut,
like snipped with wire cutters.

729
01:03:42,942 --> 01:03:46,122
If those wires
had been connected,

730
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:48,707
it would've kill-

731
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,916
it would've killed everyone
in the room.

732
01:03:51,951 --> 01:03:54,212
And then...

733
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,342
The cartridges that
he had rigged inside the bomb

734
01:03:57,377 --> 01:03:59,336
started exploding.

735
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:01,261
Now, you tell me.

736
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:07,019
How did the walls get all pocked up
and damaged

737
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:09,263
Without shrapnel
going through people?

738
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,522
It doesn't make sense.

739
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,608
It doesn't make sense.

740
01:04:18,643 --> 01:04:21,398
He wasn't that stupid.

741
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:24,117
He wasn't that stupid.

742
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,076
I don't think he would have picked
a milk jug that leaked.

743
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:31,999
I think whoever
or whatever cut those wires

744
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,371
made the milk jug leak.

745
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,958
Well, we can think a lot of things,

746
01:04:37,993 --> 01:04:41,551
but here's a fact.

747
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,964
In his journal, the guy bragged
about how many times

748
01:04:43,999 --> 01:04:45,764
he assembled the bomb, tested it,

749
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,849
and every time it worked
exactly the way he planned,

750
01:04:49,884 --> 01:04:52,479
except this time.

751
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,858
What do you make of that?

752
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:01,363
Unexplainable things
happen all the time.

753
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:04,277
I don't know. Maybe the guy
just messed up this time.

754
01:05:04,312 --> 01:05:06,744
And cut his own wires?

755
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,681
Well, that's just the bomb side of it.

756
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:16,622
Then there's the other side of it...

757
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,840
The walkers.

758
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:25,426
- Katie, can you tell
Mr. Hartley what you told me?

759
01:05:25,461 --> 01:05:28,096
Katie, he wants to hear from you.

760
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,980
Well, I was coloring,

761
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:40,270
and then when I looked up,
there was this lady standing there.

762
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,201
She was all in white.

763
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,621
She told me that she loved me

764
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,580
and that my brother
would come and get me

765
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:57,127
and everything would be okay.

766
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,755
And then I looked down for a second...

767
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:06,719
And when I looked back up,
she was gone.

768
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:10,349
Then my brother came
and took me over by the window.

769
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,392
- when the bomb went off,
she was right there to get out.

770
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:23,485
- And her sister claims
that she saw something too.

771
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,615
- I was coloring,
and when I looked up,

772
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,281
I saw angels all around where
the tape on the floor was.

773
01:06:32,316 --> 01:06:34,038
The angel people,

774
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:37,871
they stayed between us and the bad guy.

775
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:41,669
One was a lady, and she stood by me.

776
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,090
Rachel, what did the lady look like?

777
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,508
It was like a white dress.

778
01:06:48,543 --> 01:06:50,889
What kind of hair?

779
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,929
Like yours but more curly.

780
01:06:54,964 --> 01:06:57,272
But my same color?

781
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,776
Excuse me a minute.

782
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,706
Look at this.

783
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,879
That's her.

784
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,672
That's my angel.

785
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,051
Except without the glasses.

786
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,675
That's my mother, Mr. Hartley.

787
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,676
She died when I was 15.

788
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,607
Oh, she must've come back
to watch over them.

789
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,729
And there were others.

790
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,357
The Sorensen girl said a woman
helped her out of the room.

791
01:07:49,392 --> 01:07:51,576
- We got to get out of here!
- Come on!

792
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:53,320
Go, kids, go!

793
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:02,838
- Then when I got out the door,
the lady was gone.

794
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,801
- Jennie later identified
the woman as her aunt

795
01:08:11,836 --> 01:08:13,969
who died ten years ago.

796
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,054
So again it was an ancestor?

797
01:08:20,774 --> 01:08:22,355
Yeah.

798
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,813
What's that about?

799
01:08:24,848 --> 01:08:26,776
Who else?

800
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:30,566
Who else would care more
about us than our own family?

801
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,322
Can't you see?

802
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,036
You can't see
what's going on here?

803
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,581
I don't know what I see.

804
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,168
You are such a cop.

805
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:56,429
Every adult and every child
made it out of that explosion alive,

806
01:08:56,464 --> 01:09:00,804
and you haven't the humility
to thank God for blessing us.

807
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,613
Hey, bud.

808
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,284
Come here a minute.

809
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,048
You Okay?

810
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,927
Did we wake you?

811
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:34,636
Good.

812
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,514
There's something else
I want to talk to you about.

813
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,432
Jase, was there anything else

814
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:45,190
that maybe you didn't tell us?

815
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:46,939
Anything at all?

816
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:50,524
It would really help your dad
if you could think of something.

817
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,071
Yeah, I know something else.

818
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,245
Light-bulbs.

819
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,288
Right before the bomb went off,

820
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,372
lots of angels came down
through the ceiling.

821
01:10:05,407 --> 01:10:07,962
They looked like light-bulbs.

822
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:09,877
Light-bulbs.

823
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:18,132
You mean like this?

824
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:20,600
Uh-uh.

825
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,354
Like that.

826
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,702
There was an angel
for everybody.

827
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,246
They were holding hands
in a circle around the bomb.

828
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:47,912
Then when the bomb happened,
they went fast up into the ceiling.

829
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,422
This guy had police training.

830
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,980
He knew what he was doing
with that bomb,

831
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,468
but it didn't work
like it was designed.

832
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,177
It should've gone out,
but instead it went straight up

833
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:01,641
through the ceiling.

834
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,786
- Why don't you go on upstairs,
okay, honey?

835
01:11:21,821 --> 01:11:22,904
I'll be there in a minute.

836
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,749
There is no way
Jason could've known that.

837
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,794
- There's something else that I learned
that happened that day.

838
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,577
Do you think this is funny?

839
01:11:48,612 --> 01:11:50,897
Do you think this is a game?

840
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,687
Go ahead and try it again.
We'll see who wins this game.

841
01:11:54,722 --> 01:11:56,876
You want to talk miracles?

842
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:59,031
I'll tell you a miracle.

843
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:01,151
Try it, big man!

844
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:02,658
Try in

845
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,786
That me and every other officer

846
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,826
just happened to be
out of town that day,

847
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:10,792
because I know
that if I would've been there,

848
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:14,377
I would've stormed into that room
with so much hatred for that man...

849
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:20,719
I probably would've gotten myself
and everyone else killed.

850
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:26,057
But without me
and the other cops,

851
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,893
there was a chance
for it to go another way.

852
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:32,023
- Hey, he doesn't understand.
He's just a little kid.

853
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:34,062
<i>Hey -</i>

854
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,356
- Let's say a prayer.
Pass it on.

855
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,741
- Let's say a prayer.
Pass it on.

856
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:47,997
- Let's say a prayer.
- Let's say a prayer.

857
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,120
Allyson, you say it.

858
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:56,295
Why me?

859
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,334
- Because you're
the smartest in the class.

860
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,012
Dear God,

861
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,893
We need Your help today,
especially if the bomb goes off.

862
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:16,651
- Most every child prayed
sometime during the crisis...

863
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,439
<i>Not because
somebody told them to...</i>

864
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,067
But because they wanted to.

865
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,988
And they weren't the only ones.

866
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:03,819
Please, God, please.

867
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,945
- They won't allow us to be
on the elementary school grounds,

868
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,760
but we can do something right here.

869
01:14:10,795 --> 01:14:13,541
I may get fired for doing this,

870
01:14:13,576 --> 01:14:16,832
but if anyone wants to,

871
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:20,089
please join me in prayer.

872
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,968
The entire high school got together

873
01:14:28,003 --> 01:14:30,513
and knelt in prayer.

874
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:36,143
Praying for their
little brothers and sisters,

875
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:39,062
their moms and their dads.

876
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,781
Prayers for their safety were going on,

877
01:14:53,816 --> 01:14:56,830
not just throughout the town...

878
01:14:56,865 --> 01:14:59,545
12-4 to base!

879
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,756
Nadene, you got to talk to me!

880
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:07,760
But as the news spread,
throughout the whole country.

881
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:10,719
- The man and his wife have herded
the entire student body

882
01:15:10,754 --> 01:15:11,973
into one classroom.

883
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,391
They are demanding a ransom,

884
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:18,148
and we understand that that ransom
is $2 million for each child held.

885
01:15:18,183 --> 01:15:20,813
The nearest hospital
is in Montpelier, Idaho,

886
01:15:20,848 --> 01:15:22,775
which is about 30 miles away.

887
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,652
That hospital and others are gearing up

888
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:29,568
for what could be a disaster
of epic proportions.

889
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,620
Maybe even the world.

890
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,794
Dear God...

891
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,475
- Even then you couldn't bring
yourself to pray?

892
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:07,067
It'd never worked before.

893
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:08,861
Why should it then?

894
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:20,618
- Hey.
It's all right, sweetheart.

895
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,726
We pray that we will all be safe

896
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:27,402
and that everyone will live.

897
01:16:27,437 --> 01:16:30,044
We pray in Jesus's name.
Amen.

898
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,263
Amen.

899
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,260
I got to get out of here for a minute.

900
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,479
But if you ask me,

901
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,812
the most amazing thing...

902
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:53,196
Is that even though these kids
and these teachers

903
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:57,497
were terrorized for two hours
by a raving lunatic...

904
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,752
<i>So many of them turned
and went back into that room to...</i>

905
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,713
make sure that everybody was out.

906
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:10,547
They went into a room
that was on fire

907
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:12,545
that they could barely breathe in,

908
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,512
with a madman and his guns

909
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:18,302
and cartridges
exploding everywhere,

910
01:17:18,337 --> 01:17:19,722
trying to help others.

911
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,108
- You're gonna be okay.
Come on.

912
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,250
Is there anyone still in here?

913
01:17:43,285 --> 01:17:44,333
Me.

914
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:47,205
Cindy.
Oh.

915
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,592
Out the window.
Go, go.

916
01:17:52,627 --> 01:17:54,802
Ben?

917
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:58,011
- And one of them that was saved
at the end was our Cindy.

918
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,885
- I got her.
I got her.

919
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,595
- Take her!
- I got her.

920
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,815
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

921
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,779
Oh, my babies.

922
01:18:15,814 --> 01:18:17,952
Oh, my goodness.

923
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,119
Where's Daddy?

924
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:32,087
Ron, it's all right in front of you.

925
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,968
I see it.

926
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,972
But I don't-

927
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,378
Hop out, bud.

928
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,229
I'm staying with Dad.

929
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:41,861
- Well, I'm not staying.
I'm going in.

930
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:52,455
- We'll meet you right here
after class, okay?

931
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,879
- Be good.
- Bye, bud.

932
01:19:55,914 --> 01:19:58,172
Hi. Hey.

933
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,093
Hi.

934
01:20:06,128 --> 01:20:08,430
What?

935
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,690
I shouldn't be here.

936
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:17,481
I thought I could do this for Jase,
but I can't.

937
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,698
I've got so much hatred
for those people,

938
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:24,328
and I know they're dead,
and I'm glad they're dead.

939
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,496
Ron, I love you.

940
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,295
You're the greatest man I know,

941
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,709
but I will not raise our children
seeing you like this.

942
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,755
You had better figure out
what's real in this world

943
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:45,472
and what's not,

944
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,475
or you could lose us.

945
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,493
- Hey, come on, you guys.
Let's go to class.

946
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:15,171
- It's only natural that our faith
is tested when bad things happen,

947
01:21:15,206 --> 01:21:19,508
to ask ourselves, if God is in control,

948
01:21:19,543 --> 01:21:21,550
then why didn't He stop this?

949
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:25,277
Why did He let those people
enter the school?

950
01:21:25,312 --> 01:21:29,477
Why did He let any
of our innocent ones get hurt?

951
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:33,643
And not just the children
and those in room 4.

952
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:36,357
We've all been wounded

953
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,729
because those
we love the most have been hurt.

954
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:43,030
And because we're human,
it's only natural

955
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,160
that we have feelings of hatred
towards those that did this,

956
01:21:46,195 --> 01:21:51,097
but hatred toward them
is a dead-end journey.

957
01:21:51,132 --> 01:21:56,000
Hatred towards them
is like drinking a poison

958
01:21:56,035 --> 01:21:57,996
and hoping it will kill your enemies.

959
01:21:58,031 --> 01:21:59,964
It doesn't work.

960
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:05,634
What will work, what will save us
from a lifetime of hatred and loathing

961
01:22:05,669 --> 01:22:10,180
is the same thing that saved
our children in that room...

962
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,188
Prayer.

963
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:18,476
We've all witnessed the miracle
of how prayer can save lives.

964
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:22,403
Now let's let it heal our hearts.

965
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:47,634
<i># Pray He is there #</i>

966
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:49,638
<i># Speak #</i>

967
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:53,475
<i># He is listening #</i>

968
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:58,061
<i># You are His child #</i>

969
01:22:58,096 --> 01:23:00,774
<i># His love #</i>

970
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:05,112
<i># Now surrounds you #</i>

971
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:10,405
<i># He hears your prayers #</i>

972
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:15,762
<i># He loves the children #</i>

973
01:23:15,797 --> 01:23:21,487
<i># Of such is the kingdom #</i>

974
01:23:21,522 --> 01:23:25,267
<i># The kingdom of Heaven #</i>

975
01:23:25,302 --> 01:23:28,969
<i># Heavenly Father #</i>

976
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,389
<i># Are You really there? #</i>

977
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:38,352
<i># And do You hear and answer
every child's prayer? #</i>

978
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:43,692
<i># Some say that Heaven is far away u#</i>

979
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:49,676
<i># But I feel it close around me
as I pray #</i>

980
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:54,538
<i># Heavenly Father, I remember now #</i>

981
01:23:54,573 --> 01:23:58,665
Dear God, please forgive me.

982
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,419
<i># Something that Jesus
told his disciples long ago #</i>

983
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:06,715
<i># Suffer the children to come 10 me #</i>

984
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:11,347
<i># Father, in prayer
I'm coming now to Thee #</i>

985
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,810
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

986
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:22,899
Can you forgive me?

987
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,691
Let's go find your mom, okay?

988
01:24:26,726 --> 01:24:27,688
Come on.

989
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:34,491
<i># Father, in prayer
I'm coming now to Thee #</i>

990
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,776
- We knew that a miracle
had happened,

991
01:31:25,811 --> 01:31:29,242
and there was a spirit
about the town.

992
01:31:29,277 --> 01:31:30,909
We loved each other.

993
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:34,681
It was a gift, and we knew it.

994
01:31:34,716 --> 01:31:37,922
We know that there are people

995
01:31:37,957 --> 01:31:40,665
on the other side who care.

996
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:43,374
We know we're not alone.

997
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,300
We know.

998
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:50,011
I know I'm here for a reason,

999
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,265
and it's my children and my husband.

1000
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,950
And I was saved that day

1001
01:31:54,985 --> 01:31:57,600
to be a mother to them

1002
01:31:57,635 --> 01:31:59,980
and to teach them

1003
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:03,895
that not everyone
in this world is good,

1004
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:06,456
but that we can forgive

1005
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:08,947
and that we can move on.

1006
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,366
Doris Young told us that...

1007
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:15,247
- Kids, this is an experience
you'll all tell your children

1008
01:32:15,282 --> 01:32:18,037
and your grandchildren all about.

1009
01:32:18,072 --> 01:32:19,708
And she was right.

1010
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,166
I will tell my children
and my grandchildren

1011
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:24,587
over and over

1012
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:28,005
of the miracles of that day

1013
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,344
and that prayers are answered.

1014
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:35,345
I know that He protected us that day.

1015
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:39,269
He sent His angels to protect us,

1016
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:43,025
and I'm not ashamed
to be a voice of that.

1017
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,749
Before I go to bed at night,

1018
01:32:45,784 --> 01:32:48,439
I check on my four children.

1019
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,115
They are miracles to me.

1020
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:01,623
They wouldn't be here if I wasn't here.
