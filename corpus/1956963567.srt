1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,595
(distant phone ringing)

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,438
You do things
for your friends,

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,441
you got their backs
when they're in trouble,

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,443
or else what's
the friggin' point?

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,445
Excuse my language,
but you know what I mean.

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,447
'Cause Kevin and I,
we've been tight,

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,448
like forever.

8
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,449
He's like a brother
to me, you know,

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,452
it's just these boys now,
they don't grow up.

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,454
So he calls me,
and he's all like,

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,956
"I'm gonna kill myself,
and boohoo,

12
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,457
Shelley dumped me,
I'm no good,"

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,960
and I'm like,
take a friggin' valium.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,962
But there's only so much
you can do over the phone,

15
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,966
so I can kinda tell by his voice
that he's fucked up again,

16
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,335
and trust me you don't want this
guy gettin' behind the wheel

17
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,337
drivin' over to my place.

18
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:55,671
So I'm tellin' him,

19
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,174
don't do anything drastic
until I get there,

20
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:00,176
and then I go over.

21
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,678
What this punk didn't tell me
is that he was calling me

22
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,180
from the balcony
of his apartment

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,182
while this party's going on.

24
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:07,683
And I walk through the door,

25
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:09,185
it's like these
friggin' characters.

26
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:10,686
I mean, the second
I walk through that door,

27
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,190
I'm like, "Katrina,
this is no good."

28
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,192
But then they tell me that
he's holed up in the bathroom,

29
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:18,694
so I go in, you know?

30
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:21,698
I know the rules,
I didn't see nothin'.

31
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,701
Like out on the table, no
paraphernalia that I recognized.

32
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,202
There was loud music

33
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,704
and low-lives layin' around
all over the place.

34
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:30,707
And trust me, Kevin
didn't tell me the part

35
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,209
where Shelley dumped him because
he's dealing crank again.

36
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,211
She can't take it.

37
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,712
If I would've gotten there
five minutes earlier,

38
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,715
I would've said my piece,
and I would've been gone.

39
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,717
And if I would've gotten there
five minutes later,

40
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:44,187
I would've seen the squad cars,
and I woulda kept on drivin'.

41
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,054
You know?

42
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,609
You're not gonna really write me
up for five minutes, are you?

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,194
You violated your parole.

44
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,396
-I know, but I wasn't...
-On the premises

45
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:56,949
with a convicted felon,
controlled substances.

46
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,534
I wasn't doing anything.

47
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,287
Your hearing will be
at 11 o'clock on Wednesday.

48
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,871
Don't be late.

49
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,381
I've been clean,
I've been sober.

50
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,382
I've been
like a friggin' nun.

51
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,500
Well, you let them know that
at your hearing.

52
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,554
Ugh.

53
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,978
You will hear about
five or six of those a day.

54
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,230
She reminds me
of this girl

55
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,814
who moved into
my mother's neighborhood.

56
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,317
Like, right off
there's this parade

57
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,268
of nasty-looking
boyfriends.

58
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,737
(phone ringing)
'Scuse me.

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,241
Hello.

60
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,743
Yeah, just for a minute.

61
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,245
Was he there?

62
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,250
What about the truck?

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,752
Okay, let's keep trying.

64
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,755
Excuse me.

65
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,542
Now my mother is afraid
to leave her apartment.

66
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,344
There's a balance
you have to find.

67
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,346
Guiding your clients
towards rehabilitation,

68
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:04,216
but always keeping in mind
the welfare of the public.

69
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,518
The non-criminals.

70
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,104
Yeah, I'll take
the next one.

71
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,224
Re-assignment,
Fontayne Scott.

72
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,032
Scott!

73
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,714
They told me
Delmarco's gone.

74
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,801
Your supervisor retired,
I'll be taking over your case.

75
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,252
You have a drip.

76
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,817
You are Fontayne Scott.

77
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,235
Maiden name Gamble.

78
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,163
Well, that's all I got.

79
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,589
(toilet flushing)

80
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,263
Come with me.

81
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,019
Cindy, take this
sample downstairs,

82
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,021
then go to Caplan's
and get us some lunch.

83
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,022
We're eating in?

84
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,524
Um, ham and cheese on sourdough,

85
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,526
Russian dressing, no pickle.

86
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:37,526
I'll eat your pickle.

87
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,528
Yeah, okay fine,

88
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,029
and Dr. Brown's Cream soda.

89
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,030
Got it.

90
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,535
Take a seat.

91
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:04,553
-So, Bernice.
-Past acquaintance

92
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,139
between officer and client
is prohibited,

93
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,976
so after today,
you'll have to be re-assigned.

94
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,314
But for now,
you violated your parole.

95
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,820
Marvela come into the diner,

96
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,322
I hadn't seen her
in some time,

97
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,826
we gots to talkin', she offered
to carry me home on the ride,

98
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,327
that's all.

99
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,079
Marvela who has two
warrants for her arrest.

100
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,864
-I didn't know that.
-Marvela who was driving

101
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:33,665
without a valid
driver's license.

102
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,253
A friend offer you a ride, you
don't ask to see no picture I.D.

103
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,091
If I was in danger
of returning to prison,

104
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,092
I wouldn't want
to take any chances.

105
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,511
I didn't know.

106
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,013
You went to two bars
before you were picked up.

107
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,465
I had club soda.

108
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,768
Both bars are known to be venues
for narcotics transactions.

109
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,355
You see where I live,
there ain't nothin' but that.

110
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,567
So how you been, Bernice?

111
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,624
All right, I guess.

112
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,161
Got this job.

113
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,997
Yeah.

114
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,581
Married?

115
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,251
Was.

116
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,719
Kids?

117
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,806
I had a son, he's a--

118
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,309
he was a soldier in
Operation Enduring Freedom.

119
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,395
Wow, grown up that much, huh?

120
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,347
Mm-hm.

121
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,902
How you been?

122
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
You can read my jacket.

123
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,438
It's too long.

124
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,781
Look,

125
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,784
I fucked up.

126
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,787
Marvela, I know she ain't who
I'm supposed to be hangin' with,

127
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,288
but...

128
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,293
...where I live everybody
got some kind of record,

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,296
everybody likely to be carryin'
something they shouldn't be.

130
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,800
I got to feel alive sometimes,

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,302
otherwise what's the point
in being out?

132
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,889
I can't do no more time,
damn it.

133
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,559
I already let enough
of my life slip by.

134
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:32,451
Must be fun, huh?

135
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,706
Sitting here,
play God on people.

136
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,240
This sorry girl ain't
got her shit together,

137
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,244
we're gonna have to lock
her ass up some more.

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,381
You can go.

139
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,052
I'm not recommending
a hearing.

140
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,729
My record?

141
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,314
I'll write it up
so it won't be a problem.

142
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,901
Is your sample okay?

143
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,853
Nothin' in it
but orange juice.

144
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,856
They squeeze their own
at the diner.

145
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,191
Just be more careful
in the future.

146
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,610
For old time's sake, huh?

147
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,863
(phone ringing)

148
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,867
If you ever need anything...

149
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,755
If I can ever do anything
for you, anything...

150
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:30,259
Right, like I got anything
to do with your world.

151
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,763
Thank you, Bernice,
for real.

152
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,798
Parole Agent Stokes.

153
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,382
You kept your married name?

154
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,886
Look, it would be better
in here if you just--

155
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,471
Parole Agent Stokes then.

156
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,566
Hey.

157
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,569

158
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,070
You did?

159
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,073
What's his?

160
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,574
Fuzzy.

161
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,577
That's his real name?

162
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,579

No problem.

169

Really tricky case.

170
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,308
You're a public defender,
what could be tricky?

171
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,310
This kid might be innocent.

00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,304
You know, there
used to be a time

361
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,806
where I could tell
how his day had been

362
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,808
by the way he opened up
the refrigerator door

363
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,810
when he came home
from school.

364
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,084
It's just a little hash,
no big deal.

365
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,586
Yes it is.

366
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,351
Man, he got all the toys.

367
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,806
Yeah, when he was little
he had me get him Roadblock.

368
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:15,773
Who that?

369
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,226
G.I. Joe's black buddy.

370
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:22,230
And all the machine guns,
and whatnot.

371
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,198
Did he read comic books
back then?

372
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,619
I never bought 'em for him,

373
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,620
but he had 'em around.

374
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,624
All right,

375
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:37,128
let's see if I can
get into his messages.

376
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,713
I bet this is one of them

377
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,217
that can turn everything
in the house on.

378
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,720
Change the channel,
change the temperature.

379
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,723
You know, inside the joint
they got, like,

380
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,725
everybody's old throw-away
computers and shit,

381
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,012
and no walk-around telephones.

382
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,980
When you get out,
you're like years behind.

383
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,816
(loud computer alarm)

384
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,901
Turn it off,
Turn it off!

385
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,903
<i>Leave the area immediately.</i>

386
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,358
Okay.

387
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,361
So much for reading his mail.

388
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,452
You know, we can't
leave this place like this.

389
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,041
I ain't doin' no dishes.

390
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,544
I mean, in case the police,
you know, if it goes that far.

391
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:36,137
Oh, damn, he's growin'
some shit in here.

393
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,228
He ain't gonna
thank you for that.

394
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,562
Well, that's just too bad.

395
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:53,655
You know, find a bag,
and put the computer in it.

396
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:58,543
I'm gonna go upstairs and check
the pockets of his clothes.

You know his
mail hutch outside?

398
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,463
It was all crammed full.

399
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,332
I'll find something
to jack it open with.

00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:29,013

-Hello, Fontayne.

Um, hi,
I'm Bernice Stokes,

501
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:27,071
I'm not an alcoholic
or a drug addict or anything,

502
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,573
a parole officer.

503
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,709
I had her once,
she's a real ball-buster.

504
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,578
(laughter)

505
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:38,049
The more you do,
the longer you do it,

506
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,918
the less "you"
there is left,

507
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,223
and maybe that's what
you want at first.

508
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:50,595
You know, get rid of that person
you don't like so much,

509
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:55,099
you just become a habit,
a hole that needs fillin',

510
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,688
and you desperate, but
you wanna be desperate, right?

511
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:04,191
'Cause that excuses
everything, you know,

512
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:08,196
everything you about to do,
everything you ever done.

513
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:16,704
When I was in County this
last time, waitin' for trial,

514
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:21,759
I couldn't score
but once or twice a week,

515
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,263
that low-quality shit.

516
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,383
Then you just
stuck with yourself.

517
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:30,885
Stuck.

518
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:39,894
I don't know, um...

519
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:43,898
I guess I'm not
ready to die yet.

520
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,496
I've had lots of clients
go through the program,

521
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,499
and for some of them
it really worked.

522
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,501
Clients.

523
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:08,005
It's a term
they encourage us to use.

524
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,008
Hollywood agents have clients.

525
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,011
They get 10 percent.

526
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,012
Maybe I'm underpaid.

527
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:20,018
Bernice, you don't want
no part of my life.

528

532
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,998
That's been nailed shut.

533
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,452
Well, you can't beat the rent,

610
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,741

Rodney.

615
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,928
I guess.

616
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,479
I mean, I wanted him
to go to college,

617
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,483

in his head.

618
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,934
Yeah, the uniform.

619
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,486
You know, he wanted me to sign
for him when he turned 17,

620
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,988
said he wanted to be
a part of something

621
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,023
bigger than himself.

622
00:34:36,023 --> 00:34:37,024
Of course, I wouldn't.

623
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,493
He had to wait six months.

624
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,580
Barely got two civil words
out of him all that time.

625
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,365
He was never in trouble before?

626
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:45,916

627
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,868

over the speed limit,

629
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:51,422

630
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,373
Hm.

631
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,295

why we fell out.

632
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,213
In high school.

635
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,052

636
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:06,353
I didn't steal him.

637
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,855
He came after me.

638
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,274
But you didn't walk away,
did you?

639
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,978
I was jealous of you.

640
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,396
Oh, yeah, right.

641
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:17,448
You had both your parents.

642
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,451
When I came over,
they'd be so nice,

643
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,403
nobody screamin'.

644
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:27,958
I just wanted
to stay there forever.

645
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,078
We were so tight.

646
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:35,416
People always said
we could go for sisters.

647
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,301
Your boy ever been married?

648
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:39,170
Engaged.

649
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,173
Then he went over
and they talked on the computer.

650
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,176
She sent him cookies.

651
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,679
They broke up
a week after he got back.

652
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,433
He wasn't angry like his dad,
but moody.

653
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:55,436
And I just wanted him
to go back to school,

654
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,439
you know,
get his degree.

655
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:02,192
And he bought that truck.

656
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,495
(engine revving)

657
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,503
That's the husband.

658
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,710
I don't want
to step on her thing here.

659
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,431
Okay.

660
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,139
Chula!

661
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:33,440
Chula.

662
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,943

663
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:41,398
In the park up ahead,
can't miss it.

664
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,624
How'd you get to be friends?

665
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,130
Not friends,
we were together inside.

666
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,632
It's, you know,
its own world in there.

667
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,254
Now she got a baby.

668
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,222
Who's this?

669
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,807
Orfeo.

670
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,976
It's Spanish for "Orpheus."

671
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,311
Damn.

672
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,263
It was Ricky's
grandfather's name.

673
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,766
Some kind of superhero
in Ancient Greece.

674
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,018
He went down to Hell
after his wife.

675
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,736
And before that,

676
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,239
saved all the sailors
from the sirens.

677
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,108
Which is like mermaids?

678
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:28,195
They were beautiful women
who would sing.

679
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:30,697
And make you smash up
on the rocks.

680
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:37,921
He doesn't know, Ricky.

681
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,924
Anything?

682
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:42,292
He knows I was in the Locos.

683
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:46,096
But he doesn't know I did time.

684
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,766
You gonna tell him?

685
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:52,519
Maybe.

686
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:55,939
This is Bernice.

687
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,027
Her son's gotten into some mess
on the other side.

688
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,446
We could use some help.

689
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,947
That's not my world.

690
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,283
It's over the line.

691
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,154
You know anybody who could help?

692
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,663
I'll have to leave Orfeo
with my cousin.

693
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:32,759
Detective Suarez?

694
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,231
This looks like trouble.

695
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,182
I don't need any trouble.

696
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,735
These people need
to talk to you.

697
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,690
Not at my house, they don't.

698
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,192
(speaking in Spanish)

699
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,951
Gracias, Leslie.

700
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,954
Gotta watch my cholesterol.

701
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:01,956
So.

702
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,841
I want him back.

703
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,628
And if there's any way,
I don't want him to go to jail.

704
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,516
This is Juan Calles.

705
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,018
Now, you must still have friends
on the local force.

706
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,304
No.

707
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,857
There was a federal sting.

708
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,359
My voice is on the tapes.

709
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,363
I didn't take any money, but...

710
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,983
you gotta be careful
who you do favors for.

711
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:31,318
Charges?

712
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,121
I had to resign,
lost my pension.

713
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,824
I have money.

714
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,222
The first one
is to look into it,

715
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,675
should take me
a day or two to find out

716
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,176
if there's anything I can do.

717
00:39:56,177 --> 00:40:00,181
The second one is a bonus,
if I find him.

718
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:02,766
Dead or alive.

719
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,772
Look, I don't have that much.

720
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,777
You know, maybe I could
put together half,

721
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:17,248
and then pay you
the rest over time.

722
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,704
Two thousand up front then,
cash.

723
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,791
We used to call him
"The Terminator."

724
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,795
Like the movie.

725
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,797
How you been, pequeña?

726
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,516
That's my baby.

727
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,435
Huh.

728
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,020
Your man got a job?

729
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,021
Husband.

730
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,472
He's a plumber.

731
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:46,143
He need an assistant?

732
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,619
Jesus.

733
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,370
Not here.

734
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,906
I'm supposed to be retired.

735
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:12,886
♪

736
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,972
Chula.

737
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,425
You're doin' good.

738
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:19,392
Yeah.

739
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,480
Makes our life in prison
seem like a dream.

740
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,982
More like a nightmare.

741
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,769
Like a dream for me.

742
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,154
A nice one.

743
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,742
Take care of yourself, Fontayne.

744
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,754
150, 250,

745
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,256
350, 450, 550,

746
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:53,343
650, 750, 850.

747
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,512
Two, three, four, five, six,

748
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:00,467
seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve.

749
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,519
Get a money order
for this tomorrow.

750
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,022
Go to the office
and pay the property taxes.

751
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,940
This isn't dangerous, is it?

752
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:07,942
Of course not.

753
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,443
Well, if it's not dangerous,

754
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,778
why did they pay you
so much money?

755
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,283
Because of my years
of expertise.

756
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,735
It's not illegal?

757
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,296
It's no big deal, really.

758
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,754
It's just a missing person
kind of thing.

759
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,843
Do you have your pills?

760
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,445
I do all the leg work,
you'll do all the driving.

761
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,447
What, they took away
your license, too?

762
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,449
I flunked the eye exam.

763
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,453
I got macular degeneration.

764
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,954
I'm like a blur to you?

765
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,957
I do all right.

766
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,960
At the corner make a right.

767
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,212
(engine revving)

768
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,717
(door buzzing)

769
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:26,219
Hey, Freddy.

770
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,722
I like your posse.

771
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:31,691
Who is that guy, Tony Orlando?

772
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,361
You still got my package?

773
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,196
Gettin' back in the saddle?

774
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,199
Somethin' like that.

775
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,705
My sister been married
to a police, 40 years.

776
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,156
She had to have a screw loose.

777
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,208
I ain't a cop no more.

778
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,210
Oh, yes, you are.

779
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,712
You look like one.

780
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,130
You smell like one.

781
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,715
Juan Calles.

782
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,053
I better tell Ynez
to get started

783
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,004
on the funeral arrangements.

784
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,422
Has he been around?

785
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,007
Not lately.

786
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,393
Since when, not lately?

787
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,395
About two weeks.

788
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,598
Might have passed over
into T.J.

789
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:13,683
He stay there?

790
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:17,270
If he came back,
I didn't see him.

791
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,574
I need to fill this.

792
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:27,948
Shame Ynez won't qualify
for the widow's benefits.

793
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,011
I understand this has been
compromising for you,

794
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,514
and I appreciate it.

795
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,102
I'll put you on the bus
in the morning.

796
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,021
What do you mean?

797
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,605
You done what I needed.

798
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,308
Hooked me up, so--

799
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,978
This ain't over.

800
00:44:57,978 --> 00:44:59,696
What can you do down here?

801
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,281
What can you do?

802
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,782
You ever been a cop
on the street?

803
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,901
No, I went straight
to corrections

804
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,203
from youth counseling.

805
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,038
Then I ain't leavin' you alone
down here.

806
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,706
I'm not alone,
I'm with Suarez.

807
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,076
Blind old cop,
been tossed off the force.

808
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,379
If you don't go back,
you'll lose your job.

809
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,382
My parole officer will give me
another one.

810
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,302
One where I don't smell
like bacon all the time.

811
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,174
Jobs are hard to come by.

812
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,727
Tell me about it.

813
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,432
What would you do,

814
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:40,270
if you could do
anything you wanted?

815
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,279
-You remember.
-What?

816
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,998
We were gonna be stewardesses.

817
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,750
Right.

818
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,253
In Hawaii.

819
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:00,507
You're down from Oakland,
you're Rubin James Zoletti.

820
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,758
Rubin James.

821
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,710
Who's in San Quentin.

822
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,295
Got it.

823
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,226
I don't like her taking chances.

824
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:22,112
She's a big girl.

825
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,618
I'm the one in law enforcement.

826
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,623
You ever buy drugs
on the street?

827
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,124
No.

828
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,626
Turn here.

829
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,133
She's gonna do fine.

830
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,384
Pull over.

831
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,983
We'll wait.

832
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,583
So you did somebody a favor?

833
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,088
Another cop.

834
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,591
He was my best friend.

835
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,093
He was doing something
that he shouldn't have,

836
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,096
and I looked the other way.

837
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,601
If you'd done the other thing,
you'd have turned him in,

838
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,104
how you think
you'd feel about it?

839
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,061
I'll never know, will I?

840
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,545
I got a date with Tenoch.

841
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,763
You Tenoch?

842
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,264
Wassup?

843
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,900
Your boy Fito put me onto you.

844
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,654
Pull your shirt up.

845
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,750
Now the arms.

846
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,171
Those look old.

847
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,423
This ain't for me.

848
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,124
Whatever, how much you want?

849
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,595
A finger of the black eagle.

850
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,546
Two grand.

851
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:55,682
You're dreamin'.

852
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,183
Dreamin'?

853
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,685
You know,
my regular customers get it

854
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,687
for a little over half of that.

855
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,856
But you're no regular customer,
are you?

856
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,943
Well, nice knowin' you.

857
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,529
Hold on, hold on.

858
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,534
What's your hurry?

859
00:49:15,902 --> 00:49:20,156
I ain't got time to fuck around.

860
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,659
Sit down.

861
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:30,917
You know, it's nice to have
somebody from the old school

862
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:32,919
drop by.

863
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:34,387
These days,

864
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,423
these days, you gotta have
a fuckin' graduate degree

865
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,425
to stay in business.

866
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:39,926
You know, flunitrazepam,

867
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:42,395
hydroxybutyrate, M.D.M.A.

868
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,931
-College boy drugs.
-Yeah.

869
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:46,432
Yeah, but heroin?

870
00:49:46,433 --> 00:49:49,436
Shit, that's vintage, sister.

871
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,905
All right.

872
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,908
I'll hook you up.

873
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,610
A finger for a grand and a half.

874
00:49:57,611 --> 00:49:59,412
1,200.

875
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,332
See, now you're just
pissin' me off.

876
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,375
What the fuck.

877
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,795
Let's do it.

878
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:17,764
All right, follow me.

879
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,132
Scoot over.

880
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,720
Oh, get the fuck outta here,
man.

881
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,805
Move it.

882
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,563
You know, I ain't got shit--
I ain't got shit.

883
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,616
I'm Agent Suarez,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

884
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,369
This is Detective Gamble,
San Diego P.D.

885
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,039
And the lady holding the latest
in surveillance technology

886
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,077
is my colleague,
Agent Parmoli.

887
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:50,580
All you got is talk.

888
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,551
Officer Gamble,
did you receive anything

889
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,587
from the suspect?

890
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,756
He gave me this.

891
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,481
This looks like exhibit A to me,
Tenoch.

892
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,986
Y'all can't do this shit, man.

893
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,488
You can't do this,
this ain't fuckin' Mexico.

894
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,993
You have three law enforcement
officers as witnesses.

895
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,496
We have a recorded conversation.

896
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,500

Can I say prayers to it?

1080
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:09,365
You can.

1081
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,699
To really do it,
just light a candle

1082
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,702
and make a wish.

1083
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,704
What do we do now?

1084
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,205
All right.

1085
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,506
You go back to the hotel.

1086
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,092
I'm gonna go around town and
spread the word a little bit.

1087
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,093
That's all?

1088
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,595
Should be enough.

1089
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,598
Hasta luego,
señoras.

1090
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,350
You talk Spanish?

1091
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,887
I took a course for the job,
but I'm lousy at it.

1092
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,724
Now which way's
the damn hotel?

1093
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:38,561
(whistling)

1094
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,530
(door creaking)

1095
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:45,568
(whistling)

1096
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:52,078
(crowd chattering)

1097
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:12,014
(speaking Chinese)

1098
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,804
Mother Han.

1099
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,110
Among other languages.

1100
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,112
Yes.

1101
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,447
What is it you want to buy?

1102
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,782
A young black man.

1103
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,035
You're the wrong century
and the wrong country,

1104
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,986
my friend.

1105
01:04:34,987 --> 01:04:36,455
Buy is not the right word.

1106
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:40,242
More like an exchange.

1107
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:42,245
I saw images of the dead.

1108
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,248
I saw articles
of veneration,

1109
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,750
and to those who believe,

1110
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,252
I saw miracles.

1111
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,505
But I do not deal
in human beings.

1112
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:55,508
Not even to move them
from one place to another?

1113
01:04:56,809 --> 01:05:00,479
You have me mistaken
for somebody else.

1114
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:04,850
Well, then...

1115
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:06,852
if somebody were
in Tijuana,

1116
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:09,855
wanted to find a person
being held up for trade,

1117
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,657
where would he go?

1118
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,162
Some of my customers

1119
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,164
have prayed to El Santo

1120
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,417
and reported wonderful results.

1121
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:26,505
You know all the vendors.

1122
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:31,009
Any of them want to unload
an African American male

1123
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,512
by the name
of Rodney Stokes,

1124
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:36,515
I'm at the Estrella
de Bajo Hotel.

1125
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,562
Rodney started playing
football.

1126
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,149
I wanted him to...

1127
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,650
to try soccer,

1128
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,652
but he said it was
for pussies.

1129
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,156
The very first game
I went to,

1130
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,160
you know, the play
where they...

1131
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,378
they--they run at each other?

1132
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,246
Kickoff?

1133
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:10,132
He ran snap
into this other kid

1134
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,635
and got knocked unconscious.

1135
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,638
And he just...

1136
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,172
flat.

1137
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,225
And I ran out,
and they had...

1138
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,227
got his helmet off,
but there was only

1139
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,178
the guy that, you know,
wraps the tape

1140
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,097
around their ankles.

1141
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:27,182
So I...

1142
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,186
I got down on my knees,
and I--I...

1143
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,687
pulled that, um...

1144
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,690
that plastic thing
that protects the teeth out,

1145
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,692
and I...

1146
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,193
and I...

1147
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,995
started mouth to mouth.

1148
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,697
He wasn't breathing?

1149
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,281
He was cold.

1150
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:45,367
And there was steam
coming out of the mouths

1151
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,420
of all the other players.

1152
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:52,007
And there was nothing
from Rodney.

1153
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,343
You saved his life.

1154
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,845
I don't know,
maybe.

1155
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,348
I mean, he was just...

1156
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,855
He took a lot of shit later...

1157
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,856
from his friends,
you know?

1158
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,477
French kissing his mama.

1159
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:12,895
Sounds right.

1160
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,363
At the time,
you know, I thought he'd

1161
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,867
rather die
than be embarrassed like that.

1162
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,990
You can't protect him
forever, Bernice.

1163
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,491
You can try.

1164
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,250
You hook up with somebody else,

1165
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,385
after your husband passed?

1166
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,471
Not for long.

1167
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,841
I mean, when you get older,
you just--you get...

1168
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:42,675
Standards?

1169
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:43,342
(laughing)

1170
01:07:43,342 --> 01:07:45,427
Yeah.

1171
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:50,933
Not highest, maybe,
but, you know...

1172
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,435
take all that mess
you did when you were

1173
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,353
in your 20s.

1174
01:07:56,856 --> 01:08:00,159
You?

1175
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,162
I don't know.

1176
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:06,165
I don't think
I'm even a dyke.

1177
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,418
Not a real one.

1178
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,704
Now when you're inside...

1179
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:16,208
locked up...

1180
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,710
you're in a situation, right?

1181
01:08:20,045 --> 01:08:21,713
That Chula?

1182
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:24,299
Man, I ain't never been
more in love than I was

1183
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,302
with that girl.

1184
01:08:31,223 --> 01:08:33,725
Nice pair of cheerleaders.

1185
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:36,145
(laughing)

1186
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,699
Uh-oh.

1187
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,534
(laughing)

1188
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,119
You're up, you're up,
and when you're down,

1189
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,454
you're down.

1190
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,873
And when you're up
against Fremont...

1191
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:50,909
(laughing)

1192
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,411
...you're up!

1193
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:55,630
Pivot, side, down.

1194
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,133
(laughing)

1195
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,802
The red and the green.

1196
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,137
I'll go back and live
in that world again

1197
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,723
in a heartbeat.

1198
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,434
You know, he probably out
buyin' rounds

1199
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:19,187
for his amigos
on your money.

1200
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,657
What if he don't come back?

1201
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:25,610
Maybe your friend
overestimated Freddy.

1202
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:28,113
He hasn't been
on the force for a while.

1203
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:31,366
That blind detective shit
ain't too bad, either.

1204
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,536
I don't think he handin'
out any refunds.

1205
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:39,758
I'mma try somethin'.

1206
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,092
What's that?

1207
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,262
This is Rodney's phone bill.

1208
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:48,800
There's a long distance number
he calls almost every day.

1209
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:52,304
Talks at least 15 minutes.

1210
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:53,305
And it's the same

1211
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:56,141
area code
from this area.

1212
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:58,526
You got a story ready?

1213
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,029
(ringing)

1214
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,984
Hola.

1215
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:12,491
...Rodney Stokes.

1216
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,493
Oh, you speak English.

1217
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,964
Who?

1218
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:19,965
Okay.

1219
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,384
Zeidy, listen.

1220
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,969
I am Rodney's mother.

1221
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:25,971
And I am here
in Tijuana.

1222
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,974
Where are you?

1223
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,643
Club Macondo.

1224
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:39,818
Calle...

1225
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:43,822
"Pi-ya Wella."

1226
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,323
Right, okay.

1227
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:48,327
Okay, listen,
so, I'm--I'm on my way,

1228
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:51,330
and you won't have
any problem recognizing me.

1229
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,332
No.

1230
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:58,837
Sweetie, you and I
have to talk.

1231
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,840
So, I'm on my way.

1232
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,258
Okay.

1233
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,878
Rodney got himself a girl.

1234
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:07,930
Yeah.

1235
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,431
Club Macondo.

1236
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:10,298
Let's go.

1237
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,800
Well, what about Freddy?

1238
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,184
You know what?

1239
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:13,935
He can wait for us
for once.

1240
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,438
I'll bring the map.

1241
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:40,496
♪

1242
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:54,727
(yelling)

1243
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,571
Ms. Stokes?

1244
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,656
Yeah, that's me.

1245
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,323
This is Rodney's aunt.

1246
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,410
Hello.

1247
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,913
So, what goes on in there?

1248
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,282
A little bit of everything.

1249
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:19,951
I only serve drinks
to the men.

1250
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:21,837
Is that where
you met Rodney?

1251
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,121
Yes.

1252
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:24,123
Maybe...

1253
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:25,541
six month ago.

1254
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,676
And when was the last
time you saw him?

1255
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,678
Last week.

1256
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,179
He stays with me
for the night.

1257
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,048
You know what he been doin'?

1258
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,717
How he been makin' money?

1259
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,637
He helps people
to go north.

1260
01:12:38,637 --> 01:12:39,771
He helps?

1261
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,356
They pay money.

1262
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,808
Well, do you know how
we can contact these people

1263
01:12:42,808 --> 01:12:44,109
he's been workin' for?

1264
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,443
Los Chinos?

1265
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,445
The Chinese.

1266
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:47,946
No.

1267
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,948
You don't wanna
talk to them.

1268
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:50,648
You don't want to meet them.

1269
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:53,234
Oh no, yes we do!

1270
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,654
You know, they have him.

1271
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:57,122
Have him?

1272
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,824
Kidnapped,
holdin' him for ransom.

1273
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:04,829
Do you know
if he's still alive?

1274
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:06,214
Is he alive?

1275
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,082
As far as we can tell.

1276
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,583
He's alive.

1277
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,086
I don't--I don't
like what he's been doing

1278
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,587
with this--this thing.

1279
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,590
He's--but he's a man,
you know?

1280
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,591
He has his ways
and his ideas.

1281
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,093
So long hombre.

1282
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,727
So these people that
he works for,

1283
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,678
do you think that--

1284
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,264
Maybe, mi--mi primo.

1285
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:24,266
Maybe we can ask my primo.

1286
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:24,899
Your cousin?

1287
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,017
My cousin, yes.

1288
01:13:26,018 --> 01:13:28,520
Nestor from Mexicali.

1289
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,023
I'll write it down for you.

1290
01:13:32,024 --> 01:13:35,243
Does your cousin
know these people?

1291
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,745
Yes.

1292
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,747
He knows the...

1293
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,750
he has chicken
for the battle.

1294
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,001
Cock fighting.

1295
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,586
Yes.

1296
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:49,090
The Chinese, they all come
and bet their money

1297
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,961
to the fight,
to the battle.

1298
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:55,129
It's Mexicali,
it's not very far from here.

1299
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,132
It's another city.

1300
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,550
(speaking Spanish)

1301
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,134
Un momento.

1302
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,722
I was gonna meet with him

1303
01:14:04,723 --> 01:14:07,726
after work.

1304
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:10,228
We was gonna go
to Ensenada.

1305
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:15,033
But he never comes.

1306
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,534
Do you know his friends?

1307
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,620
His American friends?

1308
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,622
Juan Calles,
and this other people,

1309
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,290
cómo se llama,
Fuzzy.

1310
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,875
Fuzzy Niles.

1311
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,577
I don't like him.

1312
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:27,078
He's not good.

1313
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:29,297
He have Mexican friends?

1314
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,749
Not really.

1315
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,719
But a guy he makes
business with.

1316
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,053
What's the name?

1317
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:36,637
But that one is
very peligroso.

1318
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:37,639
He's muy dangerous.

1319
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,256
What's the name?

1320
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:39,341
Who is he?

1321
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,425
Rufo.

1322
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:41,926
He lives over there.

1323
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:44,562
Sometimes he stays there.

1324
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,485
Rodney make you any promises?

1325
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:58,860
Uh...

1326
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:01,363
you have a good son.

1327
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:04,699
He's a very good son,

1328
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,701
your son.

1329
01:15:17,462 --> 01:15:20,598
Would you tell me
if you find him?

1330
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,697
(laughing)

1331
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:27,198
(beeping)

1332
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,875
Which one of you is Rufo?

1333
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,176
Yo.

1334
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,627
You speak English?

1335
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,130
It's my second language.

1336
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,632
Can I speak with you
alone for a minute?

1337
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:51,556
(speaking Spanish)

1338
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,118
What you want with me?

1339
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,569
You know Rodney Stokes?

1340
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:05,536
Oh, Rod?

1341
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,988
That's what I call him, yeah.

1342
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,290
What are you,
his mommy?

1343
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,041
That's right.

1344
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:13,328
(laughing)

1345
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,330
He's been a naughty boy.

1346
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,547
You know where he is?

1347
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:17,966
That depends.

1348
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:18,750
Depends on what?

1349
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,385
How bad you want
to find out.

1350
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:24,055
So, we're talking money.

1351
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,475
That is my first language.

1352
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:33,598
Hey, lady.

1353
01:17:33,598 --> 01:17:35,933
You like what you see?

1354
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:39,654
You mean you two,
or the titty books?

1355
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,106
You got a card?

1356
01:17:41,106 --> 01:17:42,073
A card?

1357
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:43,691
A money card.

1358
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:44,693
Cómo se dice?

1359
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,695
ATM.

1360
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,196
ATM card.

1361
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:50,164
I ain't got nothin' like that.

1362
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,199
All Americans
got a card.

1363
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,335
Not the ones that can't
get credit.

1364
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,838
Maybe we take you
to a machine,

1365
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,040
and you show me how
to use that card.

1366
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,792
Dream on.

1367
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:01,793
Maybe you got
it in a pocket.

1368
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:03,511
Back off--

1369
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,346
Hey, don't you push
me, moronita.

1370
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,964
Hey!

1371
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:07,715
Move away from her.

1372
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,100
You don't come here
and be telling us what to do.

1373
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,636
I said to move the fuck
away from her!

1374
01:18:11,636 --> 01:18:13,220
Whoa, Bernice.

1375
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,722
Now, you really fucked
up, lady.

1376
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,224
Do you know who I am?

1377
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,059
Policía municipal.

1378
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,361
I don't see a uniform.

1379
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,613
Now you're gonna
hand me that pistol.

1380
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:22,397
(shot firing)

1381
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:22,947
Oh, shit!

1382
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,032
(grunting)

1383
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,149
You wanna piece of this?

1384
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:25,900
Don't shoot!

1385
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:27,452
Move.

1386
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,619
I coulda handled them.

1387
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,537
Let's go.

1388
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,123
(grunting)

1389
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,147
Juan Gabriel.

1390
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:11,279
So...

1391
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,415
ex-detective Suarez.

1392
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,700
What can I do for you?

1393
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,036
Chinese that are crossing
from here.

1394
01:19:19,037 --> 01:19:19,871
Not my people.

1395
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:24,008
But you know them.

1396
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,877
They pay a little mordida.

1397
01:19:25,877 --> 01:19:29,213
Permission to do
business in my territory.

1398
01:19:29,214 --> 01:19:31,216
Of course,
they lie.

1399
01:19:31,216 --> 01:19:33,218
Pinche Chinos.

1400
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:35,970
They always make more
than twice what they admit to.

1401
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,890
They have an American.

1402
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:41,776
So?

1403
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,779
They're cutting pieces
off of him every day.

1404
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:47,232
Pretty soon,
there'll be nothing left.

1405
01:19:52,237 --> 01:19:55,206
I need you to tell them
to give him back.

1406
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:05,217
Do you know the name,
Rocio Duenez?

1407
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,968
The DEA agent

1408
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,972
you people tortured
to death.

1409
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,975
Yes, so here's
what I'm going to do for you.

1410
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,479
I'm not going
to torture you.

1411
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,483
But you will disappear
south of the border.

1412
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,490
I said,
I need your help.

1413
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,993
Excuse me, do I...

1414
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,495
owe you a favor,

1415
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,999
ex-detective Suarez?

1416
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,000
No favor.

1417
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:57,135
Okay, let's do business.

1418
01:20:57,135 --> 01:20:59,137
What do you have
that I want?

1419
01:20:59,137 --> 01:21:01,856
Something that's worth
more than the gringo.

1420
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:07,362
You remember the drug bust
in '07 in Kern County?

1421
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:13,951
The one where you people
said you got 50 kilos?

1422
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,405
Which is bullshit.

1423
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,875
You people always exaggerate.

1424
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,160
We only sent up 20.

1425
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,962
We only found five.

1426
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:28,049
Five?

1427
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:32,386
The mule, who was stabbed full
of holes in Delano,

1428
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,889
he never made the phone call.

1429
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,314
Then who?

1430
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,015
Ask your compinche up there.

1431
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,317
What's his name?

1432
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:50,020
Ask him what happened
to your 15 keys.

1433
01:21:50,021 --> 01:21:51,405
And you know this?

1434
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,241
That was on the bust.

1435
01:21:57,195 --> 01:21:58,529
No kidding.

1436
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:02,534
They say he has
a avocado farm

1437
01:22:02,534 --> 01:22:05,537
up in Santa Paula.

1438
01:22:05,537 --> 01:22:06,588
Fifteen keys.

1439
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,674
What's that worth
on the street today?

1440
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,682
One gringo negro?

1441
01:22:19,884 --> 01:22:21,468
I've done a lot
of funky business,

1442

If I wanted to kill him,
he would be dead.
