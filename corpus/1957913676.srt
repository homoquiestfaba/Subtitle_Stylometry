TO TRACE.

WELL, I COULD DO IT,
COULDN'T I?

721
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:02,910
YOU?

722
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,110
YEAH, WHAT HAVE
WE GOT TO LOSE?

723
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,980
WHAT THE HECK?

724
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,680
IT'S WORTH A TRY.

725
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,090
RAFE, YOU'VE
BEEN NEGLECTING

726
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,020
THAT NEW HORSE
YOU WERE BREAKING.

727
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,260
YOU'D BEST BE GETTING
TO IT TODAY.

728
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,690
I WAS HOPING
TO TAKE CALLIE
OUT RIDING

729
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,560
ALONG THE RED CLIFFS.

730
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,200
I THINK MAYBE YOU TWO

731
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,370
GOT A LITTLE MORE GOING ON
THAN RIDING LESSONS.

732
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,470
HUH?

733
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,240
RAFE, YOU BETTER GET
TO THAT GELDING.

734
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,250
HE DEFINITELY KNOWS.

735
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:44,010
WE'VE GOT TO GET
KIA OUT OF THERE.

736
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,980
KIA!

737
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,550
MAYBE HE JUST
GOT OUT.

738
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,820
WE'LL START
SEARCHING THE AREA.

739
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,960
I'M TELLLING YOU,

740
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,260
I LOOKED
AND HE'S NOT THERE.

741
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:05,100
AND THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD
HAVE GOTTEN OUT BY HIMSELF.

742
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,240
WHAT IF
SNAPPER FOUND HIM?

743
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,170
MEET ME
BEHIND THE STABLES
WHEN I'M DONE HERE.

744
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,020
[ Thunder ]

745
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,660
WE HAVE TO
PACK IT IN.

746
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,100
IT'S GETTING LATE.

747
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,700
CAN WE START FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING?

748
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,230
YEAH.

749
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,680
HONEY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

750
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,020
I STARTED
TO WORRY.

751
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,720
WELL, WE WERE OUT ALONG THE
RED CLIFFS AND IT GOT DARK.

752
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,720
I'M SORRY.

753
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,960
I SAVED
DINNER FOR YOU.

754
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,660
YOU KNOW WHAT?

755
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,960
I'M REALLY TIRED.

756
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,800
THANKS ANYWAY.

757
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,900
SORRY I'M LATE.

758
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,210
THE ALARM
DIDN'T GO OFF.

759
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,140
WE'VE GOT TO
FINISH MILKING
BEFORE WE GO.

760
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,480
WOW!

761
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,650
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
UP REALLY EARLY.

762
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,650
I WANT TO START LOOKING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

763
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,020
YOU TWO
LOSE SOMETHING?

764
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,890
LIKE A HALF-WILD
HORSE, MAYBE?

765
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,220
YOU STEAL HIM?

766
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:42,430
WHERE IS HE?

767
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,430
I SAVED KIA'S LIFE.

768
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,630
TWO DAYS AGO WHEN
I SAW YOU TWO LEAVE

769
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,830
I DECIDED TO SEE
WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

770
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,900
SO I FOLLOWED YOU
TO YOUR HIDING PLACE

771
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
AND I SAW
YOUR GUEST.
YOU WHAT?

772
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,110
WHAT IS
HER PROBLEM?

773
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,840
LET HER TALK.

774
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:57,910
GO ON, RACHEL.

775
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,510
THEN YESTERDAY
WHEN CALLIE LEFT
BY HERSELF,

776
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,350
I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS UP.

777
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,550
I THOUGHT
I COULD SHORT-CUT IT
BY CROSSING BALDY.

778
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,050
ON THE RIDGE WAITING,

779
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,520
I SAW SNAPPER
FOLLOWING YOUR OLD TRAIL

780
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,550
TOWARDS KIA'S
HIDING PLACE.

781
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,160
I RAN DOWN
AND I GOT HIM OUT

782
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,390
BEFORE SNAPPER
COULD GET THERE.

783
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,390
SO WHERE IS HE NOW?

784
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,160
HE'S AT MY
BROTHER'S RANCH.

785
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,960
OH, YES!

786
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,800
THANK YOU, RACHEL.

787
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,140
I'M SORRY WE JUMPED
TO CONCLUSIONS.

788
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,700
YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE SORRY SHE DID.

789
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,950
WAIT, THAT'S NOT...

790
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,360
SHOE POLISH
AND A HAIRCUT.

791
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,160
DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
RECOGNIZING KIA

792
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,090
WHEN HE'S GOT
A PRICE ON HIS HEAD.

793
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,960
SO, WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

794
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,700
WE?
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
OF ME THAT HE'S HERE.

795
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,570
SHE'S RIGHT,
CALLIE.

796
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,010
WE'RE ENTERING KIA IN
THE CROWN INVITATIONAL.

797
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,580
REALLY?

798
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,040
WHO'S RIDING?

799
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,410
YOU'RE JOKING?

800
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,490
WELL, I'M NOT
SURE YET.

801
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:54,290
SHE'S DOING OK,
BUT SHE HASN'T HAD
MUCH TIME.

802
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,530
WHY NOT
LET ME DO IT?

803
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,490
REALLY?
YEAH.

804
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,560
THAT WOULD BE...

805
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,030
RACHEL'S A GOOD RIDER,
CALLIE.

806
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,040
IF SHE'S ON KIA,
WE MIGHT HAVE
A REAL SHOT.

807
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,400
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
THINK IT'S FAIR.

808
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,840
IT WAS MY IDEA.

809
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,110
I WAS THE ONE WHO...

810
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:14,110
IS THIS ABOUT
YOUR RIDING KIA
OR WINNING THE RACE?

811
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,750
OK, WHATEVER.

812
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,960
KIA WILL NEED AS
MUCH RIDING TIME
AS HE CAN GET

813
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,730
IN TRAINING
FOR THE RACE.

814
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,800
AND I CAN
STILL TEACH YOU.

815
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:38,770
EASY NOW.

816
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,340
EASY BOY.

817
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,270
EASY, BOY.

818
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,340
EASY, KIA.

819
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,370
EASY.

820
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,240
WHOA.

821
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:57,850
EASY.

822
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,520
COME ON.

823
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,460
HOLD IT, RAFE.

824
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,220
WHOA, KIA!

825
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,060
WHOA!

826
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,190
DA!

827
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,740
THAT'S ALL
IT TAKES.

828
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:23,610
WHOA.

829
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,020
EASY.

830
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:27,920
COME ON, KIA.

831
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,650
WHOA.

832
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,160
EASY, KIA.

833
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,760
WORK WITH ME, KIA.

834
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,630
COME ON.

835
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,030
EASY.

836
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,740
LOOKING GOOD.

837
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,770
EASY, BOY.

838
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,670
EASY.

839
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,750
ONE, TWO, THREE.

840
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:01,580
EASY, BOY.

841
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,250
WHOA, BOY.

842
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,220
WHOA!

843
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,300
COME ON, CAL,
BE AGGRESSIVE.

844
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,140
SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS.

845
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,180
I'LL SHOW HIM
WHO'S BOSS, ALL RIGHT.

846
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,280
WHOA, GOT HIM!

847
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:33,820
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

848
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,050
YOU GOT HIM.

849
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,850
OH, YEAH.

850
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,020
YOU GOT HIM.

851
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:41,660
WHOA.

852
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,190
YEAH.

853
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,360
WHOA!

854
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:48,400
ALL RIGHT.

855
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,400
WHEW.

856
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,240
WHY IS HE DOING THAT?

857
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,880
HE'S A
CUTTING HORSE.

858
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,710
IT'S PART
OF HIS BREEDING.

859
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:03,850
ONLY THIS SILLY HORSE
THINKS HE'S A BARREL RACER.

860
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,080
A WHAT?

861
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,990
IT'S A COMPETITION
WHEN A HORSE RACES
AGAINST THE CLOCK

862
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:12,120
AROUND BARRELS
SET IN THE GROUND.

863
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,620
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

864
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,030
TO YOU, MAYBE.

865
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,800
JUST FOR FUN,
TRY RUNNING KIA UP
AND AROUND THE BARREL.

866
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,940
HAH! HAH!

867
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,020
COME ON, BOY.

868
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,920
COME ON.

869
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,250
HAH!

870
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,160
YAH!

871
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,610
WHOA.

872
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:03,710
GOOD BOY.

873
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,280
GOOD BOY.

874
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,140
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BOY?

875
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,550
YOU READY
FOR A REAL RIDE?

876
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,420
THAT'S VERY GOOD,
CALLIE.

877
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,660
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SUCH
A GOOD ARTIST.

878
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,720
THANKS.

879
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,390
THAT'S A GREAT LIKENESS.

880
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,500
I'M SURPRISED
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

881
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,860
YEAH.

882
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,870
UMM, I HAVE SOME
GOOD NEWS.

883
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,770
YOUR MOM CALLED
THIS MORNING

884
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:40,200
AND SHE FINISHED HER
RESEARCH PROJECT EARLY

885
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:44,110
AND SHE'S GOING
TO BE COMING HERE
TO SPEND SOME TIME

886
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,780
BEFORE THE TWO OF YOU
GO HOME TOGETHER.

887
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,210
WE'RE NOT LEAVING BEFORE
NEXT WEEKEND, ARE WE?

888
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,080
NO, WHY?

889
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,580
IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT
GOING ON?

890
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,450
OH, NEXT WEEKEND.

891
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,790
THAT'S THE
CROWN INVITATIONAL.

892
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,190
IS THAT IT?

893
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,660
OH, RIGHT.

894
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,860
WELL, MITCHELL
AND I ARE SPONSORS.

895
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,870
KIA WAS GOING TO RUN
IN THE 2-YEAR-OLD RACE.

896
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:24,250
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT HELPS
TO CONFIDE IN AN ADULT.

897
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,850
ABOUT WHAT?

898
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,220
REMEMBER CALLIE,
SNAPPER'S NOT A STUPID MAN.

899
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,300
ANY NEWS ON KIA?

900
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:51,840
I THINK MAYBE

HOW DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT MY MOTHER'S LIKE?

939

SHE RAISED YOU ALONE,
RIGHT?

940

A STRONG SPIRIT.

FOR A GOOD STORY.

[ All together: ]
YES!

979
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,690
IT'S TRADITION
THAT THE ELDERS TELL STORIES.

980
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:11,690
THAT WAY THE OLD STORIES
SURVIVE NEW GENERATIONS.

981
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,930
MOPEAH ALWAYS DOES IT
ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

982
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,670
COYOTE WAS OUT HUNTING ONE DAY
WHEN SNAKE APPEARED.

983
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:27,310
"COYOTE," HE SAID,
"DON'T GO HOME.

984
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:31,080
"A MONSTER
WHOSE SIZE FILLS THE VALLEY

985

"SUCKED UP ALL THE ANIMALS
WITH HIS HOT BREATH."

986
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:39,990
COYOTE KNEW
THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE IN FEAR,

987
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:43,230
SO WITH HIS BUNDLE OF STICKS
AND FLINT KNIFE

988
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,930
HE SET OFF FOR THE VALLEY.

989
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,800
HE FOUND THE MONSTER.

990
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:51,330
IT STRETCHED
FROM RIDGE TO RIDGE.

991
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,410
AND HE CALLED OUT,
"HO THERE, MONSTER.

992
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,840
"WHY ARE YOU IN MY VALLEY?"

993
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:05,010
THE MONSTER THREATENED
TO SWALLOW UP COYOTE
ON THE SPOT,

994
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,880
BUT COYOTE
KNEW HOW TO BRAG...

995
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:11,420
"YOU DON'T SCARE ME,"
HE SAID.

996
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,290
"MY MAGIC
IS MORE POWERFUL."

997
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,760
THE MONSTER JUST LAUGHED

998
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:21,660
AND SWALLOWED COYOTE
WITH ONE HOT BREATH.

999
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,400
WHAT DID COYOTE DO?

1000
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,040
HE LANDED
IN THE MONSTER'S STOMACH

1001
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,340
WHERE ALL THE ANIMALS
WERE CRYING.

1002
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,480
SO HE MADE THEM FOLLOW HIM
THROUGH MANY CHAMBERS

1003
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:39,310
UNTIL THEY SAW
THE MONSTER'S HEART
SWINGING ABOVE THEM.

1004
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,920
SO COYOTE, WITH HIS STICKS
AND FLINT KNIFE,

1005
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,950
LIT A FIRE.

1006
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:50,360
BEFORE LONG, THE MONSTER
SHOUTED, "COME OUT, COYOTE.

1007
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,260
"COME OUT!"

1008
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,570
BUT COYOTE
ONLY THREW ANOTHER STICK
IN THE FIRE.

1009
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:59,870
WHEN THE CORDS THAT HELD UP
THE HEART BURNED THROUGH,

1010
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:04,670
THE MONSTER'S HEART FELL
AND HE DIED.

1011
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,680
OH, BUT WAIT.

1012
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:16,320
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
IS YET TO COME.

1013
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:23,360
AFTER THE ANIMALS
ESCAPED THROUGH THE
MONSTER'S OPEN MOUTH,

1014
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,030
THEY ALL RAN HOME.

1015
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:32,540
BEAR SAID,
"LEAVE THE BODY HERE TO ROT."

1016
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,140
COYOTE WOULDN'T ALLOW THAT

1017
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,210
AND HE BEGAN
CARVING UP THE MONSTER.

1018
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:43,080
THE THIGH BONE
HE THREW TO CHIEF MOUNTAIN

1019
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,280
NEAR THE MONTANA GLACIERS

1020
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:50,090
SAYING, "THERE WOULD
LIVE A LONG-LEGGED RACE."

1021
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,990
FROM THAT LAND
COME THE TALL BLACKFEET.

1022
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:59,230
AND THE MONSTER'S FAT
TOSSED TO THE BLACK HILLS.

1023
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:03,600

CAME THE ROUND SIOUX TRIBE.

THE MONSTER'S BODY WAS GONE.

AND LOOKED AT HIS PAWS.

OF THE MONSTER'S BLOOD
WERE LEFT ON THEM.
