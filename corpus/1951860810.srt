Michael Scott Kelvin,
What are you doing?

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,880
What the hell are you
trying to do, kill us?

4
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,480
- Christ!
- Beth and I were just playing, Mom.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
Mikey, you promised you
wouldn't do this again.

6
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,960
Beth wanted to see it.
Tell her it was your idea.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,760
You stop trying
to blame your sister

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,120
Look at me.
You've ruined everything.

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
You clean up
this mess, right now!

10
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,840
We'll deal with your punishment
when your father gets home.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,400
Beth, come on.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,600
I hate you!
You don't care about me!

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,160
You're not my real mother!

14
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,640
Why didn't you tell her you did it?

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
Give me back Alice, Mikey.

16
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,320
She never punishes you.
Never, ever!

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Give it, Mikey. Give it.

18
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,000
You're my sister.
You should have been on my side!

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
You're not my real brother!

20
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,760
Mommy! Mikey went outside
without permission.

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,880
Mommy! Gimme back!
She's mine.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,040
Make me, Beth.

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,160
- Mikey, give me back my doll.
- Forget it!

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,920
Gimme back my doll, Mikey.

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on, baby.
Come and get it.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,560
Give it, Mikey.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
I bet you can't get it.

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,720
Mikey, give me back my doll.

29

Come and get it.

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,840
I hope your doll likes to swim.

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,520
She's drowning, Beth.

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,720
Stop it! Stop it!

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
Stop it!

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,520
Ah!

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,320
Mikey! Help me!

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Mommy!

37

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,640

I shouldn't even be thinking this.

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
But sometimes I think
adopting him was a mistake.

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,920
I mean, I just don't know what--

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,080
Michael, what have I
told you about knocking?

47
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,480
You don't love me anymore.

48
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,120
Of course, I do. Your father
and I love you so very much.

49
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,200
Then why do you
always punish me?

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840
Look, we'll talk about this
when your father gets home.

Mikey, Put that down.
That's not funny.

- That's not a toy.
- I know that.

56

doing all day?

63
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
- Waiting for you.
- Where's your mom?

64

- Mi-- Mikey.
- See ya, champ.

No!

71

Collins, who's she?

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
A neighbor.

78
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,600
Hmm.

79
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,760

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah.

Well, let's go.

This way.

83
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,200
It looks like he saw his little girl
in the pool and panicked.

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
Yeah, but the window didn't
do that to his head.

didn't know hanging around?

for this, Jake.

Katherine, would you knock it off?

105
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,560
He had bushy hair,
a mustache, and a red jacket.

106
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,640
You did see him, then?

107

I came home from the park.

108

and he drove away.

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,120
It was big and brown.

111

Is that all?
You've been a big help.

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
Reynolds, the corner's about done.

113

separated so far apart.

knew the killer.

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm gonna put these here.

Who's that, Mikey?

128
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,400
I don't know. A stranger.

129
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,480
Have you seen him before?

130
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,080
No. Mommy doesn't
know who he is.

131
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
I have to go outside.

132
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,800

have to go outside?

I'm not supposed
to see what happens.

134
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,600
And what's that?

135
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,240
He's gonna do something
to my family...

136
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,840
kill them.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
How do you feel
about that man?

138
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
I hate him.

139
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,360
I hate him! I hate him!
I hate him!

I've just had my final session
with Michael Kelvin.

142
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,760
The boy's going through
a great trauma,

143
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
and there's still quite
a bit of emotional scarring.

144
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,480
Are you sure?
He's ready to leave?

145
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,520
I believe so.

146
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,200
I'd suggest you get him
placed with adoptive parents

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,800
as quickly as you can.

148
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,960
Mikey just needs a good,
stable home.

149
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm not a blood relative.

150
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Your his mother's sister!

151
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,240
That kid was adopted.

152
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,840
Are you positive?

153
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,520
Michael hasn't said anything to
any of us about being adopted.

154
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
They took him away
from his real parents!

155
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,280
He was abused or something.
Gracie never knew for sure.

156
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,000
Kelsey, I know
that the last few days

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
have been very difficult for you.

158
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,200
But you're all he has.

159
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,800
You know that your sister
would have wanted you to--

160
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm not taking him. Not a chance.

161
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,960
Why not?

162
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,720
Look. You can't make me
that that kid, can you?

163
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,360
No, I can't.

164
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,560
Good. The kiss him
good-bye for me.

165
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,000
God, I hate airports.
I hate coming here.

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
No matter what time you leave,
you're always late.

167

Jesus, there's something wrong
with this damn flash!

168
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,360
We're not gonna need
the damn flash if we miss him.

169
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,480
Son of a bitch.

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,080
Oh, son of a bitch. There it is!

171
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,680
You're gonna have to start
watching your language.

172
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,240
Yes, mother.

173
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
WOMAN: There he is.

174
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,680
Mikey, this is the Trentons.

175
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,960
Are you my
new mommy and daddy?

176
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,320
- Go on.
- Oh, Mikey. Here's a present.

177
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,480
Thanks, Mr. Trenton. It's great!

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,080
You don't have to
call me "Mr. Trenton."

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,680
What do you want me
to call me?

180
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,680
- Um...
- You can start with Neil and Rachel.

181
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Okay, Rachel.

184

So, do you like to pitch?

185
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah. But I'm a better hitter.

186

We don't have a pool,
but there is a lake.

187

Cool. Swimming's one
of my favorite things.

This is it, Mikey. We're home.

189

Wow!

190

It's really neat.

Welcome to your new home, chief.

192
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,200
I think you're gonna be
real happy here.

193
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
Here we are.

194
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Hi!

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,040
Welcome!

196
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,200
Mikey, this is Mrs. Owens.
She lives next door.

197
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

198
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,320
And this is Ben.

199
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,920
Ben will be in
your class at school.

200

- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,560
Alright!

202
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,680
I just know the two of you
are gonna be best of friends.

203
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,320
Mrs. Owens also has a
daughter named Jessie.

204
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,880
You want to see your room?

205
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,000
- Ben on come, too.
- Okay.

206
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,080
Where's your sister?

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,120
She had to go away to school.

208
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,680
Oh.

209
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,840
Wow, this is neat!

210

This is Rachel's job.

211

She creates these
aquariums for people.

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,600
She takes care of 'em.

213
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,680
Maybe you can he me, Mikey.

214
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,280
What's that?

215
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,360
That's a mommy fish
and her new babies.

216
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
Why are they separated?

217
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,040
Because this kind of
fish eats its babies.

218
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,120
- Really?
- Gross.

219
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,720
Can I take care of the baby fish?

220
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,760
Sure.

- Hi, Rachel.
- Shawn, thanks.

223
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,080
No problem.

224
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,680
Mikey, I want you to meet
my best friend, Shawn.

225
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,430
Hi.

226
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,840
Miss Gilder's a teacher.
She teaches fourth grade.

227
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Is she gonna be my teacher?

228
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes. But don't expect any favors

229
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,120
because I'm friends with your mom.

230
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,160
I love school.

231
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,200
That's good.

232
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,320
Mikey, you want to see
your room or what?

233
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,640
Well, how are you doing, Mom?

234
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,720
He seems like a good kid.

235
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,280
- You think so?
- Uh-huh.

236
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,400
You know more about kids
than I do, that's for sure.

237
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,600
This has all happened so fast.

238
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,200
I haven't even had times
to childproof the house yet.

239

You are going to make
a great mother.

240
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,880
A great mother!

241
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,960
Then why am I do nervous?

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,280
I think it's kind of
natural; don't you?

243
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,680
You and Neil have wanted
a family for five years.

244
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,760
A baby, yes.

245
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,400
But this child's been
shuffled around so much.

246
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,960
Yeah.

247
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,600
He'll do okay.

248
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,640
Just love him.

249
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,840
- You're right.
- Uh-huh.

250
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,920
He's no different than any other kid.

251
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,640
Did you brush your teeth?

252
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,200
Uh-huh.

253
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,280
Good. Then it's time
to hit the hay.

254
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,880
Good night, Mikey.

255
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,960
Mom, Dad.

256
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,160
Thanks.

257
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,600
You're welcome.

258
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,960
Lights out, buddy.

259
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Can you believe what
a great kid he is?

260
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,760
I think we really lucked out.

261
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,320
Yeah.

262
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,120
So have you kept up
on all your reading?

263
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,680
Uh-huh.

264
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,000
What do you think about that

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,880
fourth stage of development
in the laughler book?

266
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,960
Fascinating.

267
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,360
Rachel, there is no
fourth stage of development

in the laughler book.

269
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,520
I don't need to read any book

270

to tell me how to be a good mother.

271
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,160
A little help couldn't hurt.

272
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,720
You read too much, Trenton.

273
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,800
Somebody's got to do it.

274
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
It's been a long time, Neil.

275
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720

Did you do this with your dad?

We didn't have the indian guides,

281

but I used to go out
riding with him a lot.

282

We did a lot of
fun things together,

283

There was no other kid.

But what about
all the stuff in my room?

I was just looking that up.

367
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,840
"A person swimming is symbolic
of a desire for freedom,"

368
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,440
"a feeling of being caged."

369

to loosen their grip a bit.

into visible light,

389
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,520
kind of like a light bulb.

390

The light bulb sends
a current through a wire.

391

between two wires.

Yeah.

472

I've been reading,

from unattached syndrome.

It's psychotic behavior.

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm sorry. I hope I'm not
being rude, but...

what you're saying?

No, I'm not sure.
But I certainly think

482
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
it's something to be
wary of; don't you?

483
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,480
So do I. But I don't think you
should be an alarmist about it.

484
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,600
Look, I was a nine-year-old
kid once myself.

485
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,240
I used to do drawings like this,
but I'm not psychotic.

486
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,360
I like monster movies.
I especially like Godzilla,

you know, the one with the
fire coming out of his mouth.

488
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,560
So why encourage us to read this
if you don't take it seriously?

489
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,160
I encourage you to read it, yes.

490
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,960
I don't encourage you to
take every word literally.

So you're not gonna
do anything about this?

492
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm not gonna
do anything right now.

with your new parents?

Tell me something else, Mikey.
What's your favorite movie?

545

Freddy Kruger,
"Nightmare On Elm Street."

546
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,520
Oh, I'll bet. Real scary, huh?

547

Is that why you don't
like to take your shirt off?

come here for a minute?

NEIL: Based on this, you think
Mikey has an emotional problem?

772
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,040
All we're suggesting
is that maybe Mikey

773
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,640
should see a child psychologist.

774
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,760
Christ! I made a picture
like this when I was kid!

775
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,960
I know. But we feel that Mikey
may be-- just may be--

776
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,040
suffering from
an emotional disorder

777
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,600
called unattached syndrome.

778
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,720
It's very common
in adopted children.

about his history?

I know Mikey.

781

If anything, he's
brighter than other kids.

782
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,160
It's not a question of whether
he's bright or not, Rachel.

783
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,800
Most kids don't mutilate

784

785
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,520
He did what?

786
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,160
Self-mutilation is an expression
of a child crying out for help.

787

Wait a minute!
I've read all the books, too.

- Too perfect.
- There is no such thing.

how to explain it.
