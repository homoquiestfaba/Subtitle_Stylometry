00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,868
Jojo Betzler.

3
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:48,057
Ten years old.

4
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:52,327
Today you join the ranks of the Jungvolk,

5
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:56,391
in a very special training weekend.

6
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:01,601
It's going to be intense,
but today

7
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:04,631
you become a man.

8
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:11,727
I swear to devote all my energies and my
strength to the savior of our country -

9
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,726
Adolf Hitler.

10
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:18,870
I am willing and ready
to give up my life for him,

11
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:20,999
so help me God.

12
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,686
Yes, that's right.

13
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,678
- Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?
- Snake mind.

14
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:29,950
- And Jojo Betzler, what is your body?
- Wolf body.

15
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,767
- Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?
- Panther courage.

16
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:36,788
- And Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?
- A German soul.

17
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,801
Yeah, man, you're ready.

18
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,322
Adolf?

19
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,901
I don't think I can do this.

20
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:47,812
Was? Of course, you can!

21
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:50,681
Sure, you're a little bit scrawny
and a bit unpopular,

22
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,999
and you can't tie your shoelaces
even though you're ten years old.

23
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:58,871
But you're still, the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met.

24
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,251
Not to mention the fact
you're really good-looking.

25
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:04,350
So, you gonna get out there
and you gonna have a great time, okay?

26
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,333
- Okay.
- That's the spirit! Okay.

27
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:08,865
Heil me, man.

28
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:09,925
Heil Hitler.

29
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:13,069
Whaat?
You can heil me better than that.

30
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:14,373
Heil Hitler.

31
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,298
Just throw it away,
don't even think about that.

32
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:18,062
- Heil Hitler.
- No, you're over thinking it.

33
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,404
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hiteler.

34
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:22,508
Who's Hiteler?
Do you even speak German?

35
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,905
- Heil Hitler!
- That's not the heil, this is the heil -

36
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:25,900
- Heil!
- Heil Hitler!

37
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,222
Heil Hitler!

38
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:32,131
That's it, you got it.
Heil Hitler! Have a great day.

39
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:33,972
Heil Hitler! You gonna be the best.

40
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,475
Heil Hitler! You can do it.

41
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,429
Heil Hitler!

42
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:44,252

70
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:41,299
Jungvolk, welcome to the
Hitlerjugend training weekend.

71
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:44,462
In which we will make men
and women of you all.

72
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:47,178
My name is Captain Klenzendorf.

73
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:51,365
- You may call me Captain K.
- Captain K!

74
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,064
And this is Sub-Officer Finkel.

75
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:57,730
This is Fräulein Rahm.

76
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,525
Hey, Heil Hitler, everyone.

77
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,401
So, a little about me.
Who am I and why am I here,

78
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,228
talking to a bunch of
little titty-grabbers,

79
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:08,338
instead of leading my men into battle to
their glorious deaths. Great question.

80
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:11,775
I've been asking myself every day
since operation "Screw up".

81
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,555
Where I lost a perfectly good eye
in a totally preventable enemy attack.

82
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:21,456
And according to my superiors, you need two
eyes to be a meaningful part of the war effort.

83
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:24,241
Can two eyed people do this?

84
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:33,783
Jesus!

85
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:37,195
Over the next two days, you,
little critters, will get to experience

86
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:41,684
some of the things that my teacher
in the army goes through every day.

87
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:44,272
And even though it would appear
our country is on a back foot,

88
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,694
and there really isn't much hope
in that's winning this war.

89
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:49,284
Apparently, we're doing just fine.

90
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:53,797
Anyway.

91
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:57,204
You boys have all been issued
with your Deutsches Jungvolk Daggers.

92
00:05:57,204 --> 00:06:00,255
These are very special
and expensive weapons.

93
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:04,505
You should never be without them.
And don't try to stab each other!

94
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,221
No stabbing!

95
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,001
No stabbing.

96
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:10,715
This is your first step towards being men.

97
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:13,577
Today you boys will be
involved in such activities, as

98
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:18,135
marching, bayonet drills, grenade throwing,
trench digging, map reading, gas defense,

99
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:22,900
camouflage, ambush techniques, war games,
firing guns and blowing stuff up.

100
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:28,099
The girls will practice
important womanly duties, such as

101
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:32,835
dressing wounds, making beds,
and learning how to get pregnant.

102
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,606
I've had 18 kids for Germany.

103
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,821
Such a great year to be a girl.

104
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:43,799
All right. Let's get to it.

105
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,155

a Jewish man mated with a fish.

and advanced than any other race.

Not to me.

137
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,986
If I met one, I'd kill it like that.

138
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:44,212
Like...

139
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:46,012
That.

140
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:49,492
But how would you know if you saw one?
They can look just like us.

141
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:51,400
I'd feel its head for horns.

142
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,408
And they smell like Brussels sprouts.

143
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,639
Oh yeah, I forgot about
the Brussels sprouts bit.

144
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,568
Imagine catching one
and giving it to Hitler.

145
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,760
That'd be a sure-fire way
to get into his personal guards.

146
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:06,041
Then, we would become best friends.

147
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,951
I thought I was your best friend.

148
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:11,799
Yorki, you're my 2nd best friend.

149
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:14,218
First place is reserved for the Führer.

150
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:18,039
So, unless you're Hitler,
hiding in a fat little boy's body,

151
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,445
I'd be happy with 2nd place.

152
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,825
I guess I'm just a kid
in a fat kid's body.

153
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:25,933
Case closed.

154
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,515
When you stand before the enemy,
and have to end his life.

155
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:39,606
Which of you
will have the stomach to do this?

156
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,031
Good.

157
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,267
There is no room in Hitler's army
for those that lack strength.

158
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,993
We want hardened warriors.

159
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:53,110
Those, that are prepared to kill at will.

160
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:56,345
- Can you do this?
- Yes.

161
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:01,248
Johannes.

162
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:04,473
Can you kill?

163
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:09,266
Pff, of course. I love killing.

164
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:11,706
Good.

165
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,399
Come here.

166
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,696
Don't be scared. Come on.

167
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,200
Good.

168
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,996
Kill it.

169
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:36,514
Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.

170
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:39,811
Or are you scared?

171
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,698
I'm not scared.

172
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:43,140
I just...

173
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,696
Now!

174
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:49,618
Place both hands around its neck,

175
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,938
and then one hard twist.

176
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,583
He might scream, but we'll just
use the boot to finish it off.

177
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:03,876
Kill!

178
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:30,536
Good shot.

179
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,883
You are a coward. Just like your father.

180
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,824
He's not a coward, he's fighting in Italy.

181
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,508
Really? Well, no one has heard
from him in 2 years.

182
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,249
He is a deserting coward.

183
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,113
He's scared, and so are you.

184
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:52,271
You're as scared as a little rabbit.

185
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:58,654
Scared little rabbit.
Maybe we should snap your neck too?

186
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,874
Jojo the rabbit.

187
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,744
<i>Jojo Rabbit.</i>

188
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:23,305
Poor Jojo.
What's wrong, little man?

189
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:25,581
Hi, Adolf.

190
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:29,092
Wanna tell me about that rabbit incident?
What was all that about?

191
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,969
They wanted me to kill it.

192
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm sorry.
I couldn't.

193
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,991
Don't worry about it.
I couldn't care less.

194
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,035
But now they call me a scared rabbit.

195
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:43,244
Let them say whatever they want. People
used to say a lot of nasty things about me.

196
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:48,370
This guy is a lunatic. Look at that
psycho, he's gonna get us all killed.

197
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,351
I'll let you in on a little secret.

198
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,789
The rabbit is no coward.

199
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:58,336
The humble little bunny faces
the dangerous world every day,

200
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,904
hunting carrots for his family,
for his country.

201
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:05,370
My empire would be full of all animals.

202
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:11,312
Lions, giraffes, zebras,
rhinoceroses, octopuses,

203
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:13,018
Rhinoctopuses.

204
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:15,939
Even the mighty rabbit.

205
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,222
Cigarette?

206
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,009
No thanks, I don't smoke.

207
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,663
Let me give you some
really good advice.

208
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,425
Be the rabbit.

209
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:26,263
The humble bunny can outwit
all of his enemies.

210
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,000
He's brave and sneaky and strong.

211
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,908
Be the rabbit.

212
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,614
Jojo.

213
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,727
Are you all right, Jojo?

214
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:40,905
Who were you talking to?

215
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:42,729
Nobody.

216
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,290
I thought you were crying.

217
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,209
Are you a tear-job specialist?

218
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,313
No.

219
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:49,303
Case closed.

220
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,675
Now, it's time for Jojo

221
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:53,743
to show those stick insects

222
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:57,613
who is the real cowardly rabbit.

223
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,323
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

224
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,208
Never mind.

225
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,997
Jojo, where are you going?

226
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,982
To be the rabbit!

227
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,952
Jojo Rabbit!

228
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,710
Hunting carrots, Jojo Rabbit!

229
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,808
Hey, this is amazing!
We're like two human antelopes.

230
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:21,766
Now, lads.

231
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:27,345
Each of you will be given the opportunity
to ignite and throw a grenade.

232
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,945
I will personally be supervising
each of you

233
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,317
to make sure
you don't blow your eyes out, or something.

234
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,327
All right. Who's first?

235
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:37,584
Klaus!

236
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,764
Shit!

237
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:26,511
Don't do that.

238
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,541
Jojo!

239
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:32,622
Feldscher, take him in.

240
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,337
Jojo!

241
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:41,356
Oh mein Gott,
he looks like a Picasso painting.

242
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:52,280
His mother is going to kill me.

243
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,431
My darling cub.

244
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,420
Hey, kid.

245
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,426
My darling little cub.

246
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,992
Why so happy?
Your son is ugly like a monster.

247
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:05,345
Hey, you're no monster!

248
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:09,037
Besides, your scars will heal and you'll
get most of the movement back in your legs.

249
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,265
But I'll never be
in Hitler's personal guards.

250
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,833
You're fine as you are.

251
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:14,799
I'm just happy to have you back home.

252
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:19,179
Mama lion worries about her cub,
especially when papa lion isn't here.

253
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,229
Or Inga lion.

254
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:26,356
Or Inga lion.

255
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,679
Grab the rabbit by the tail,
wrap it around his ear.

256
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,388
Tie it all up and then stuff him back
down the hole.

257
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,214
Now then, let's get on our way.

258
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:41,162
I think getting out of the house
will do wonders for your recuperation.

259
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:43,157
I don't want to go out there.

260
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,494
What? Don't be silly.
Of course, you do.

261
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:46,983
I look stupid.

262
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,061
People will stare.

263
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:50,654
Enjoy the attention, kid.

264
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:53,093
Not everyone is lucky enough
to look stupid.

265
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,603
I, for one, am cursed to look
incredibly attractive.

266
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:58,142
Now, you're going to pluck up
your courage,

267
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,691
walk out that door
and have an incredible adventure.

268
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,066
Okay?

269
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:03,548
Okay.

270
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,757
Field Marshall Jojo,
you're our top man.

271
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,797
Prepare to leave the house.

272
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:11,498
Is it dangerous?

273
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:13,239
Extremely.

274
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:16,133
Heil Hitler!

275
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,218
Jesus!

276
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,962
Looking good, kid.

277
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:22,568
Frau Betzler,
you're looking fetching, as usual.

278
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:29,144
It's because of you my son can't walk
properly and has a messed up face.

279
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,667
He stole my hand grenade, just took...

280
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:32,842
Yeah, yeah...

281
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:36,190
So, you are going to look after him
while I'm at work.

282
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,320
Make sure he has a job
and feels included, got it?

283
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,062
Got it.
Yeah, I really got it.

284
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,857
Good.

285
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:48,092
Guys, this is Johannes Betzler,
a kid I told you about, remember?

286
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:53,480
He stole the hand grenade and blew himself up,
and as a result I got demoted for negligence.

287
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:56,532
Now I get to work in this office
with all these wonderful kids.

288
00:18:57,278 --> 00:19:01,334
So, Jojo, I'm sure we can figure out
something for you to do.

289
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:04,119
Ideas? Guys?

290
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:09,055
Okay, we need somebody
to walk the clones.

291
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:15,077
Also, I think, maybe he could hand out
this new propaganda,

292
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:18,375
and deliver these conscriptions.

293
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:22,552
I don't suppose I could be conscripted,
could I?

294
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,455
Yes, that's a wonderful idea.

295
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,967
Yes, I give my full permission for you
to send this 10 year old child into war.

296
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,199
Will someone get this kid a gun?

297
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,002
And I'll be more than happy
to fight in the France.

298
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,098
Get in line, kid.

299
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:34,143
Okay, here's the conscriptions.

300
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:35,832
And here's the gun.

301
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:39,606
No.

302
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,444
Yuck!

303
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,367
Look.

304
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,116
What did they do?

305
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,843
What they could.

306
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:34,433
Come on.

307
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:54,394
Hey, Jojo Rabbit!
Look at your face.

308
00:20:57,142 --> 00:21:00,762
I'm going to war,
and you are a pup man!

309
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:05,326
Jojo Rabbit!

310
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:08,018
Mama?

311
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,699
Field Marshall Jojo is home.

312
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,347
Mama?

313
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:23,532
Mama, I'm home.

314
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,551
Mama?

315
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,523
Mama?

316
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,625
Hi.

317
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:39,780
What do you want?

318
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,138
Are you a ghost?

319
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,850
Sure. A ghost.

320
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:55,372
Don't make me run, kid!

321
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:59,205
I'm far too hungry, and you know
how much we love the taste of blood.

322
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,323
Lost something?

323
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,945
I'm not a ghost Johannes,
I'm something worse,

324
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:13,530
but I think you already know that,
don't you?

325
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:15,419
You know what I am?

326
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:17,500
- No.
- Yes.

327
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,229
Say it.

328
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,449
Say it!

329
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:23,204
A Jew.

330
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,503
Gesundheit.

331
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,961
You can't be here.

332
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:31,414
Well, your mother invited me,
so, I suppose, that makes me her guest.

333
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:32,310
Not allowed!

334
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,764
What will you do sweet Hitlerchen?

335
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:40,770
Of course.

336
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,620
Go on then. Tell them.

337
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:47,800
But you know what happens if you do?

338
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:52,657
I'll tell them you helped me.
And your mother too.

339
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,815
And we'll all be kaput.

340
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:57,651
And if you tell her you know about me.

341
00:25:57,782 --> 00:26:00,160
Just one word.

342
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:05,944
I'll do the world a great big favor
and cut your Nazi head off.

343
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,294
Got it?

344
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:09,869
Yeah.

345
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,715
I think I'll hold on to this.

346
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,668
It's pretty.

347
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,815
Sheesh, that was intense.

348
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,899
What am I going to do?

349
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:34,524
Honestly, no idea.

350
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:38,320
I mean, there could be more of them.
Hundreds of them, living in your walls.

351
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,432
How did she get control like that?

352
00:26:42,432 --> 00:26:44,965
She must've used her powers.
Mind control.

353
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:46,555
Typical.

354
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,973
- You saw how fast she moved?
- Yes.

355
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,621
Like a little female Jewish Jesse Owens.

356
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,503
And now she's got your fancy knife.

357
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:54,316
A knife!

358
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:58,149
Yeah, like a little female Jewish
Jesse Owens Jack the Ripper.

359
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,984
You're definitely in a pickle, my friend.

360
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:02,845
What to do?

361
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:04,523
Got it!

362
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:07,057
Burn down the house
and blame Winston Churchill.

363
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,429
Or negotiate.

364
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,526
Excuse me?

365
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,978
Little girl?

366
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:34,422
Jew girl in the wall?

367
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,618
Yoohoo, Jew?

368
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:49,415
Okay, well, I'll just say
what I have to say, and that's this,

369
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:51,383
I'm not scared of you and I think

370
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:54,274
you should find
somewhere else to live, okay?

371
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:58,152
Not okay.

372
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,161
Get, the hell, out of my room.

373
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,092
She's pretty rude, you know.

374
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,056
That's just my 2 pfennige.

375
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:12,880
And now she's got two knives.

376
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,953
I know!

377
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,173
How are you gonna chop up stuff?

378
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:16,801
I don't know!

379
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,324
And she's still up there too,
that thing, that...

380
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,357
- Jew!
- Yeah, Jew, yeah.

381
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,943
What are we gonna do about that Jew?

382
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:24,251
You think of something.

383
00:28:24,424 --> 00:28:25,609
Now I'm the expert?

384
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:28,587
Stop offering me, damn, cigarettes!
I'm ten!

385
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:31,010
Okay, sorry, I'm stressed out.

386
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,964
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

387
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:36,023
You can't tell your mother
or that Jew will cut off your Nazi head.

388
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:39,779
But, there's no reason this thing in
the attic needs to ruin your life.

389
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,088
In fact, you could use her
to your advantage.

390
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:43,939
How?

391
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,122
When someone tries
to use mind powers on me.

392
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,882
You know what I do?
Use mind powers back on them.

393
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,637
Remember last year,
when that one-armed pirate

394
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:53,057
Von Stauffenberg tried to blow me up
with a table bomb?

395
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:55,096
- Yeah, you survived.
- Correct-a-mundo.

396
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:58,264
But the only reason I survived,
apart from having bomb-proof legs,

397
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:00,762
is because I outwitted old Von Stauffy.

398
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,636
I let him think that I was dead,
when in actual fact I was absolutely fine.

399
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:08,084
By pretending I was dead
I drew out all the traitors.

400
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,733
So, what are you going to do?

401
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
- Pretend I'm dead?
- Exactly.

402
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:13,389
Wait, no.

403
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,961
No, what I mean is this.

404
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:19,100
Make her feel safe, and then she'll drop her
guard and then you will be the one in control.

405
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:20,058
Reverse psychology.

406
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,667
Don't complicate things.

407
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:25,246
Just use my backwards mind power trick,
and everything will be fine.

408
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,533
I gotta go. We are having a unicorn
for dinner at my place tonight.

409
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:31,832
Concentrate, Jojo.

410
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,297
Remember, a Jew living in your wall
is better than

411
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:39,099
two Jews flying around with their bat wings,
climbing down chimneys and eating innocent Nazis.

412
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,432
And don't give her anymore knives!

413
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,816
Jews.

414
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:10,326
Darling cub, why are you up?

415
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:12,388
Did you eat anything?

416
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:16,053
Sorry, I lost track of time, I was
talking a long walk and having a think...

417
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:18,121
What are we going to do
with these laces?

418
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:21,257
My goodness, you know, you'll have
to tie them, eventually, you know.

419
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,137
- I heard her.
- What?

420
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,244
Who?

421
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:29,328
Inga. Her ghost.

422
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:32,932
It's so sad for you.

423
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,482
You've lost your mind.

424
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:38,348
It's sadder for me though,
because I have to live with a crazy person.

425
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:43,266
I heard noises upstairs.

426
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:44,935
Ghosts, honestly?

427
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:46,858
You know what I heard? Rats.

428
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:49,191
Yes, we have them.
Can you believe that?

429
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:53,100
Dirty animals, I've been meaning to
tell you to stay away from upstairs

430
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,401
until I've cleared them all, okay?
I don't need you getting sick.

431
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,177
Okay, Mama.

432
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,810
I'll watch out for those dirty rats.

433
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:03,740
Where are all, the goddamn, knives?

434
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,578
Are you going to bed too?

435
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,879
Yes, soon.
I have to tidy some things first.

436
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:26,968
What things?

437
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,476
Mama things.

438
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:32,386
Boy, you have to trust me, okay?
I'm the boss here, yeah?

439
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:35,298
I guess.

440
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,181
Good boy.

441
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,718
Yes, but with one eye.

442
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:42,767
Almost.

443
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:44,512
Not quite.

444
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:52,746
Great! You got it.
Yeah.

445
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:02,080
You have to be more quiet,
he heard noises up here.

446
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:05,535
If I have to choose
between you and my son, I...

447
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,167
I won't know where to send you.
You hear me?

448
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:16,126
He can't know.
If he knows then they know.

449
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,296
You could reason with him.

450
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:21,850
You don't know him.
He's a fanatic.

451
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:26,214
It took him 3 weeks to get over the fact
that his grandfather was not blond.

452
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:29,181
I know he's in there somewhere.

453
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:34,720
The little boy, who loves to play, and
runs to you because he's scared of sundown.

454
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:37,277
And thinks you invented
the chocolate cake.

455
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,548
In the end it's only a way of

456
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,822
hope,

457
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:47,894
in that your only remaining child
is not just another ghost.

458
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:52,074
Perhaps we all ghosts now,
and we just don't know it.

459
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:54,801
Perhaps.

460
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:58,644
You've lived more lifetimes than most.

461
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:02,634
I haven't lived at all.

462
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,412
You're being changed.

463
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,762
And they say you can't live,
that you won't live.

464
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:11,944
If that comes true, then they win.

465
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:13,816
They have been winning so far.

466
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:16,918
They'll never win,
that's the power you have.

467
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:20,502
As long as there's someone alive,
somewhere, then they lose.

468
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:24,073
They didn't get you yesterday or today,
you make tomorrow the same.

469
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:28,748
Hey.

470
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:31,992
Tomorrow must be the same.

471
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,427
Jesus Christ!

472
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:05,897
You must stretch.
Does that hurt you?

473
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:06,549
Yes.

474
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,657
Good. Pain is your friend.

475
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:12,452
Soon your leg will only be
a little bit deformed and pointless.

476
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,009
I'm going to recommend
another month of pool,

477
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,668
because your face
might scare the other kids.

478
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:19,335
It's kind of ugly.

479
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:21,539
Okay, who's next?

480
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:28,773
Jojo, baby, I have to go.

481
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,811
See you at home.

482
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:42,089
Hi, Captain K.

483
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:44,834
Hey, if it isn't
the hand grenade himself.

484
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,927
How's the leg, kid?

485
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:51,521
It's pretty much healed.
It only 80 % hurts now.

486
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,219
What are you guys doing?

487
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:56,576
I'm here to teach the HG boys
water warfare training.

488
00:34:57,317 --> 00:35:01,044
You know, in case they ever need
to go to battle in the swimming pool.

489
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,620
Can I ask you a question about Jews?

490
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:08,418
Oh God, why?

491
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,777
What should I do if I see one?

492
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:17,556
Okay, if you see a Jew,
you tell us, we tell the Gestapo,

493
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:20,384
and they tell the SS,
and then they go, and they kill the Jew.

494
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,735
And anyone who helped the Jew.

495
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:27,319
And, because, these are very paranoid times,
probably some other people just in case.

496
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,111
It's a pretty joined up process.

497
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:34,400
Even if the Jew hypnotized someone to
make them hide the Jew in the first place?

498
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,168
I'd be amazed if that could happen.

499
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,355
No, it can happen.

500
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,732
It happened to my uncle.

501
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:48,545
A Jew hypnotized him,
and he became a massive drunk,

502
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:51,284
and a gambler,
and he cheated on his wife,

503
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:54,757
and he had an inappropriate relationship
with my sister,

504
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:57,774
and then he drowned
in an unrelated accident.

505
00:35:57,774 --> 00:35:59,975
But it was the Jew's fault.

506
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:02,686
Anyway, did you see one?
A Jew?

507
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,643
I'm not sure
I'd be able to tell if I did.

508
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,794
Me neither. Without their funny hats
it's damn near impossible.

509
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,881
Someone should write
a book on the subject.

510
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:14,246
That would make
things so much easier.

511
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,910
Finky, they are drowning, come on.

512
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:22,899
I'll see you later, little man.

513
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,259
Okay, here's the situation.

514
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,998
If I tell on you, you'll be in big trouble.

515
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:49,996
And I don't think you want that.

516
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:53,188
But then you'll tell on me and my mother,
and we'll be in trouble,

517
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:54,726
which I don't want.

518
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:58,334
And if you tell my mother I know,
then she'll kick you out,

519
00:36:58,334 --> 00:36:59,973
which you don't want.

520
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:05,340
And if I tell my mother I know,
then you'll cut off my Nazi head,

521
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:07,812
which I also don't want.

522
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:11,319
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

523
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,442
It's just a normal stalemate.

524
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,072
I have some conditions
for allowing you to stay here.

525
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,015
- Conditions?
- Yes.

526
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:21,332
Tell me everything
about the Jewish race.

527
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:23,177
Okay.

528
00:37:24,798 --> 00:37:28,837
We are like you, but human.

529
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:30,739
Please take this seriously.

530
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:34,926
Think of this as an exposé.
I want to know all your secrets.

531
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:38,574
Kindly refrain
from sitting on my sister's bed!

532
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:41,161
Boy, she doesn't need it.

533
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,062
You know nothing of my sister.

534
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,552
Inga and I were friends.

535
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:48,589
I remember you.
Such a funny little boy.

536
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:52,914
Enough with the small talk.
Start telling me about your kind.

537
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,273
Obviously, we are demons,
who love money, right?

538
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:00,493
Obviously, everyone knows that.

539
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:05,285
But what people don't know
is that we also allergic to food.

540
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:09,017
Cheese, bread, meat.
That stuff will kill us instantly.

541
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:13,344
So, if you are thinking of ending my life,
that's the fastest way.

542
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:15,674
Also biscuits - lethal.

543
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:19,884
Very funny.

544
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,813
Anyway, there's not enough food for you,
so I don't know what are you doing to do.

545
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:26,046
Your mother managed
to find me some bread.

546
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:29,525
She's kind.
She treats me like a person.

547
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:32,302
But you're not.
Not a proper person.

548
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:33,841
Are you?

549
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:37,986
How dare you, Jew?

550
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:41,497
You are weak, like an eyelash.

551
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:48,039
I am born of Aryan ancestry.
My blood is the color of a pure red rose.

552
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,067
And my eyes are blue.

553
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,003
Break free.

554
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:57,392
Break free great Aryan.
There are no weak Jews.

555
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:01,570
I am descended from those,
who wrestle angels and kill giants.

556
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,695
We were chosen by God.

557
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:09,099
You were chosen by pathetic little man,
who can't even grow a full mustache.

558
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:12,597
The stronger race, huh?

559
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:23,549
So, how is it all going
with that Jew thing upstairs?

560
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:25,711
Well, she doesn't want to talk to me.

561
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,689
Well, you are a Nazi.

562
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:29,174
I guess.

563
00:39:29,505 --> 00:39:31,927
This book is going to be harder to write
than I though.

564
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:39,538
What's she doing?
She's burning something.

565
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,411
What is she burning?
What are you burning?

566
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:43,756
She can't hear you.

567
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,048
What are you burning?

568
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,590
Why so happy?

569
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,016
Things are changing.

570
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:04,138
The allies have taken Italy, France will
be next. And soon the war will be over.

571
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,401
God dammit!

572
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:08,608
Why does that make you happy?
You hate your country that much?

573
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:12,119
I love my country, it's the war I hate.
It's pointless and stupid,

574
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,001
and the sooner we have peace the better.

575
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:17,980
Oh, the war will end.
We will crash our enemies into dust!

576
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:20,853
And when they are destroyed,
we shall use their graves as...

577
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:22,799
Okay, no more politics.

578
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:25,623
Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.

579
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,225
Let's eat.

580
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:37,680
You aren't eating.

581
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:42,516
No, I am not that hungry.
I might eat later.

582
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,129
For now, I'm just going to
chew on these grapes.

583
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:54,225
Well, I'm especially hungry tonight,
so, maybe, I'll just finish yours.

584
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,363
Don't want it to go to waste.

585
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:13,780
How was your day Johannes?

586
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,218
Oh, you know, just wandered around, being
a deformed kid who has nothing to live for.

587
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,251
You are not deformed.

588
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:23,153
My face looks like a, goddamn,
street map, woman.

589
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:29,082
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
If my father was here, he'd get it.

590
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:30,915
Well, he's not.

591
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:34,915
I know.
And instead, I'm stuck with you.

592
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:38,378
- You want your Daddy?
- Yeah, I do.

593
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:41,365
Yeah.

594
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,275
Fine!

595
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,044
Don't you ever talk to your, goddamn,
mother like that!

596
00:42:15,121 --> 00:42:17,149
Paul, what happened?

597
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:19,638
Paul?

598
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,269
I yelled at the kid.

599
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:23,446
What? Go apologize.

600
00:42:27,063 --> 00:42:28,438
Sorry, kid.

601
00:42:28,438 --> 00:42:31,221
What? What kind of apology was that?

602
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:41,791
Sorry, kid.

603
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:47,121
Jojo.

604
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:50,422
I know you miss me, but I'm..

605
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:54,170
I'm out there,
trying to make a difference in the world.

606
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:59,198
And while I'm gone,
I need you to take care of my Rosie.

607
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:02,438
Can you do that?

608
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:06,085
Yes, Dad.

609
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:08,117
Thanks.

610
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:11,384
She's doing what she can.

611
00:43:13,786 --> 00:43:16,885
Oh, Gosh. We made a good kid, huh?

612
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:20,425
Damn, that's good!

613
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:24,538
It reminds me of dancing with Rosie
in the red salon.

614
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,174
You remember, honey?

615
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:28,618
Of course, I do, babe.

616
00:43:36,477 --> 00:43:37,720
Hey.

617
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,073
Don't just sit there, kid.
Come, dance with your parents.

618
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:34,126
So, I'd like you to draw a picture
of where Jews live.

619
00:44:34,287 --> 00:44:38,743
Where you all eat, sleep,
and where the Queen Jew lays the eggs.

620
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:40,531
You really are an idiot.

621
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:42,485
Come on,
we have a lot of work to do.

622
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,775
Tell me about your family.

623
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:48,047
I'll tell you about the Jews, but you are
not privileged to know about my family.

624
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:49,716
But I need background.

625
00:44:49,716 --> 00:44:53,248
Why are you hanging around with me,
don't you have any friends?

626
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:54,709
Of course! Yorki.

627
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:56,976
- Yorki?
- Amongst others.

628
00:44:57,713 --> 00:45:00,252
- You don't have anyone.
- I have Nathan.

629
00:45:00,252 --> 00:45:02,371
Nathan? Who, the hell, is that?

630
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,545
My fiancée. I have him.

631
00:45:04,545 --> 00:45:05,577
Where is he?

632
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,846
Fighting in the resistance.
See?

633
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:12,532
He proposed to me
on the banks of the Fluss.

634
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,197
He knelt down like a proper gentleman,
recited a poem by Rilke.

635
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,200
And when I said <i>yes</i>
we danced into the night.

636
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:22,415
Snore. Who's Rilke?

637
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,516
A great poet. Nathan's favorite.

638
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,103
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yeah.

639
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:28,953
He's coming to rescue me,
and then we'll go live in Paris.

640
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,798
You'd turn your back
on Germany forever?

641
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:33,868
It turned on me first.

642
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:35,517
Well, we don't need you.

643
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:39,038
You and your stupid boyfriend
can shut up and go live in

644
00:45:39,038 --> 00:45:42,786
dumb-cheese-snail-baguette land.

645
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:45,466
Now, now, just because
you don't have a girlfriend.

646
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,248
I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.

647
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:49,204
One day you'll make time.

648
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:51,437
You'll think of nothing else.

649
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:54,789
You'll meet someone,
and spend your days,

650
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:58,044
dreaming of the moments
you can hold them in your arms again.

651
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:01,298
That's love.

652
00:46:02,783 --> 00:46:03,821
Ridiculous.

653
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:05,305
Finished.

654
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:17,235
I said to draw where Jews live.

655
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,898
This is just a stupid picture of my head.

656
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:22,833
Yeah, that's where we live.

657
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,452
Rilke.

658
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,258
Where are you poetry-writing dumbheads?

659
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:38,211
Yes, great thinking, Rabbit.

660
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,542
We'll use all of these books
to make a fake floor

661
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:43,008
that she'll fall through
straight into a pit full of

662
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,558
piranhas and lava and bacon.

663
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,626
She won't know what hit her.

664
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:51,750
You shush, shush me.

665
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:54,322
Let's get a book and let's go,
libraries are dumb.

666
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:02,767
Yeah, this is a really good idea
what we are doing right now.

667
00:47:02,825 --> 00:47:06,532
If she had a heart,
this would break it clean in two.

668
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:10,945
I have something to tell you.

669
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:15,869
I came across an old letter
from Nathan, your fiancée.

670
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:17,199
Addressed to you.

671
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:19,049
What, the hell,
are you talking about?

672
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:20,619
I'll just read it.

673
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:25,961
<i>Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say,</i>

674
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:29,529
<i>but I don't want to marry you anymore.</i>

675
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:33,737
<i>I found a new woman, and we love a lot,
and do the tongue kiss.</i>

676
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,354
<i>It's like my favorite poet Rilke says,</i>

677
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:41,699
<i>We need, in love, to practice only this:
letting each other go.</i>

678
00:47:42,214 --> 00:47:44,478
<i>So, goodbye
and sorry about letting you go.</i>

679
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:48,875
<i>From Nathan, your ex-fiancée.</i>

680
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:51,961
<i>P.S. I am not really in the resistance.</i>

681
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:56,147
<i>I was lying.
I'm unemployed and quite fat now.</i>

682
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:29,161
Don't open the door, but I, actually,
forgot that there was a second letter.

683
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,552
<i>Dear Elsa, I just wanted to let you know
that I don't want to break up with you now.</i>

684
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:41,912
<i>I changed my mind because I don't want you
to kill yourself over me.</i>

685
00:48:42,148 --> 00:48:46,076
<i>Which a couple of girls have done in
the past, and it's pretty stressful.</i>

686
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:48,759
<i>I need you to stay alive.</i>

687
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,915
<i>Thank God you've been taken care of
by that kid,</i>

688
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:56,249
<i>who I must say is a remarkable young man
beyond his years, and brave too.</i>

689
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:58,867
<i>And let's still get married sometime,</i>

690
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:02,621
<i>even though I am truly unemployed
and have nothing going for me.</i>

691
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:06,447
<i>Yours, Nathan.</i>

692
00:49:15,624 --> 00:49:16,889
- Beethoven.
- Einstein.

693
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,276
- Bach.
- Gerschwin.

694
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:20,286
Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.

695
00:49:20,286 --> 00:49:21,874
Musicians, is that all you have?

696
00:49:22,405 --> 00:49:23,411
Rilke.

697
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:26,961
Of course, your favorite, Rilke.
Jewish mother.

698
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:29,280
- Dietrich, then.
- Houdini.

699
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:31,994
No, that's impossible!

700
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:34,608
Believe it brother.
Just ask Pissaro, Modigliani,

701
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:39,755
Man Ray, Gertrude Stein, Mr. Moses, and
the king of them all Jesus Christi, Amen.

702
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,792
You're just saying any old name now.

703
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,512
I've never heard of these people,
and now I'm fed up.

704
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:46,641
Hey.

705
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:49,904
If you find any more of those letters,
would you let me know?

706
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:53,594
Sure. Okay. Bye.

707
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:59,561
These banks used to be full of lovers.

708
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,205
There was dancing and singing and...

709
00:50:04,098 --> 00:50:05,515
Romance.

710
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:07,745
There's no time for romance!

711
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:09,517
We're at war!

712
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,627
There's always time for romance.

713
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:15,381
Someday you'll meet someone special.

714
00:50:15,818 --> 00:50:17,909
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

715
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,504
Why else tells you that?

716
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,834
Everyone.

717
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:25,925
Anyway, it was a stupid idea.

718
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:28,265
You're stupid.

719
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:30,958
Love is the strongest thing in the world.

720
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,465
I think you'll find that metal
is the strongest thing in the world,

721
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:37,567
followed closely by dynamite
and then muscles.

722
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:41,306
Besides, I wouldn't even know it
if I saw it.

723
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:45,574
Surprise, surprise.
Your shoelaces are undone again.

724
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:50,803
Jojo, you'll know when that happens.

725
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,600
You'll feel it.

726
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:55,507
It's a pain.

727
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:56,542
In my arse, I bet.

728
00:50:56,542 --> 00:51:00,188
In your tummy.
Like it full of butterflies.

729
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:01,897
Yuck.

730
00:51:02,177 --> 00:51:03,795
Yeah, yuck.

731
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:07,842
Come on, Shitler,
let's get a move on.

732
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:10,619
Hey!

733
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,030
What's wrong with you?
I'm worried about you, man.

734
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,958
Are you drunk? Again?

735
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,069
Come on.

736
00:51:16,575 --> 00:51:17,856
Can you please untie...

737
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:19,560
You are really getting fat.

738
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,380
I'm not...

739
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,792
You know what, why don't I just
leave you here, okay?

740
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:25,817
And I'll come and get you tomorrow.
Okay, how about that?

741
00:51:25,992 --> 00:51:27,781
You think you are adult, darling.

742
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:30,952
I'll meet you back at the house,
I think, tomorrow morning.

743
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:35,048
You're growing up too fast.
A ten-year old shouldn't be

744
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:38,087
celebrating war
and talking politics.

745
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:42,440
You should be climbing trees,
and then falling out of those trees.

746
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,821
But the Führer says,
when we win,

747
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:48,030
it is us, young boys,
who will rule the world.

748
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,832
The Reich is dying,
we are going to lose the war,

749
00:51:52,832 --> 00:51:55,050
and then what are you going to do?

750
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Life is a gift.
We must celebrate it.

751
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:03,488
We have to dance to show God
we are grateful to be alive.

752
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:12,066
Well, I won't dance.

753
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:14,327
Dancing is for people,
who don't have a job.

754
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:16,125
Dancing is for people who are free.

755
00:52:16,588 --> 00:52:18,264
It's an escape from all of this.

756
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,830
Well, you are free
to dance your way home.

757
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:22,691
I'll ride.

758
00:52:23,045 --> 00:52:24,146
Oh, no, you don't.

759
00:52:24,146 --> 00:52:25,721
No one can stop me!

760
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:36,150
♪ Mama, ich rufe dich an, oh Mama ♪

761
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:40,092
♪ Doch einst kommt der Tag ♪

762
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:41,670
♪ Wo ich Dir sag ♪

763
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,912
♪ Ich bin ein grosser Mann ♪

764
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,536
Welcome home boys.
Now go home and kiss your mothers.

765
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:53,821
♪ Und ruhe dich aus ♪

766
00:52:54,431 --> 00:53:00,853
♪ Du hast schon genug getan ♪

767
00:53:09,278 --> 00:53:11,534
No news from Nathan today,
I'm afraid.

768
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:15,751
He's probably doing something amazing,
like reading a book or growing a beard.

769
00:53:20,047 --> 00:53:21,185
What's wrong?

770
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:25,632
Do you want me to tell you
about the Jews?

771
00:53:26,194 --> 00:53:27,577
I don't care.

772
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:34,150
In the beginning, we used to live in caves,
deep, deep in the center of the Earth.

773
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,899
Wait.

774
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:40,552
Scary places, full of strange and wonderful
creatures all with one thing in common...

775
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,637
Stealing the ends of penises.

776
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:45,314
No, you idiot. The love of art.

777
00:53:45,314 --> 00:53:46,991
No cutting penises off?

778
00:53:47,146 --> 00:53:48,312
Do you want the story or not?

779
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,843
You may continue,
but I know it's true, the penis thing.

780
00:53:52,123 --> 00:53:53,877
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

781
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,898
And moving on.
After many years of developing

782
00:53:57,898 --> 00:54:03,055
magic and spells, we slowly moved out
of the caves and into the towns.

783
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,790
Some of us stayed in the caves though,
in animal bodies.

784
00:54:06,941 --> 00:54:09,037
Which are blobs or something?

785
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:11,595
I'll draw them for you.

786
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,184
It'd be better with color.

787
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:30,028
Where's the horns?

788
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:31,294
Under the hair.

789
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,878
Where are yours?

790
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,236
I'm too young.
They grow when you turn 21.

791
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:43,110
These days we live among normal people,
but often we take over a house

792
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,936
and hang from the ceiling
when we sleep, like bats.

793
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:51,703
And another thing is -
we can read each others' minds.

794
00:54:52,243 --> 00:54:56,055
Oh my God! Everyone's minds?
What about German minds?

795
00:54:56,055 --> 00:54:59,586
No, their heads are too thick
for us to penetrate.

796
00:55:00,648 --> 00:55:04,765
Like birds, our true language
sounds like singing.

797
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:09,416
And we also attracted
to shiny things.

798
00:55:09,928 --> 00:55:14,084
Crystals, glass and gold.

799
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:18,301
<i>Attracted to shiny things.</i>

800
00:55:19,327 --> 00:55:22,343
But also ugly things.
Jews love ugliness.

801
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:24,447
That's another thing
we learned in school.

802
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:28,107
You love them, yes? Ugly things?

803
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:36,301
Hi.

804
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:38,200
You two seem to be getting on well.

805
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:40,897
I was just making she was still alive.

806
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:41,946
What do you care?

807
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:45,214
I don't, I just don't want
a dead person in my house.

808
00:55:45,214 --> 00:55:46,576
How would you like it?

809
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,772
I'd love it.
More dead people in my house, please.

810
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:51,888
Look, just all the time you two
are spending together,

811
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:53,976
it's making me feel
very uncomfortable.

812
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,983
You suggested it in the first place.

813
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:56,950
Did I?

814
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,673
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

815
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,246
Besides, it's for the book.

816
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:05,355
Oh my God. You are right.
I'm sorry. Did I make it weird?

817
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:09,190
It's weird now, isn't it?
It shouldn't be weird between us.

818
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:11,142
None of this should be weird.

819
00:56:11,884 --> 00:56:14,137
It's fine. I'm just tired.
I'm going to bed.

820
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,046
Yeah, I was just keeping
your bed warm for you,

821
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:18,002
'cause that's what real friends do.

822
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:20,585
Hey, what do you think
about this uniform?

823
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,358
I'm not sure about the hips on the pants.
Should they be bigger?

824
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,360
You look great.

825
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,563
Thank you.

826
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:29,864
Now, listen, Jojo,
can I give you some really good advice?

827
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:32,232
When you see what's in her mind,

828
00:56:32,232 --> 00:56:34,781
and where she's trying to make you
go in your mind.

829
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:37,792
In your mind,
you must go the other way.

830
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:41,752
You're getting what I'm saying?
Do not let her put you in a brain prison.

831
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:48,380
That, dear Jojo, is one thing that cannot
and must not ever ever happen to a German!

832
00:56:48,832 --> 00:56:52,452
Do not let your German brain
be bossed around!

833
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:57,376
I won't let her boss my German brain
around, Mein Führer.

834
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:58,881
Try not to.

835
00:56:59,782 --> 00:57:03,731
Now, I think you've got a lot of
good information in your book.

836
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:06,678
It's time to show it to the world,
don't you think?

837
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:08,502
Yeah.

838
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:13,431
Adolf?

839
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:15,379
Do you think I'm ugly?

840
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,674
Yes.

841
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,840
Is he asleep?

842
00:57:29,685 --> 00:57:31,279
He's different.

843
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:35,182
He suspects something.
He thinks Inga's ghost ends up here.

844
00:57:38,841 --> 00:57:41,109
You remind me of her.
You really do.

845
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:45,291
I would love to have seen
her grow into a woman.

846
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:50,607
But I'll have to watch you instead.

847
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,277
I don't know anything about
being a woman.

848
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:04,297
Is that what it is?
You do things, like drink wine?

849
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:08,248
Sure, you'll drink.

850
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:10,605
Champagne if you are happy.

851
00:58:10,784 --> 00:58:12,599
Champagne if you are sad.

852
00:58:13,254 --> 00:58:17,810
You drive a car, gamble if you want.

853
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:21,492
Own diamonds.
Learn how to fire a gun.

854
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:24,838
You can travel to Morocco.
Take up lovers.

855
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,792
Make them suffer.

856
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,388
You look a tiger in the eye.

857
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,777
And trust without fear -
that's what it is to be a woman.

858
00:58:35,354 --> 00:58:37,331
How do you do that?

859
00:58:37,844 --> 00:58:40,506
How do you know
you can trust someone?

860
00:58:41,923 --> 00:58:43,891
You trust them.

861
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:47,180
Goodnight.

862
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:53,881
All those other things.
Did you do that stuff?

863
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,590
You know, go to Morocco,
and the rest.

864
00:58:59,673 --> 00:59:03,094
No, I've never
looked a tiger in the eye.

865
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,250
Finkel, I meant we'd need dogs
for when the city is attacked, not, actual

866
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:27,618
German shepherds.

867
00:59:28,615 --> 00:59:30,017
Get them out of here.

868
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:32,875
Get them out of here! Now!

869
00:59:33,143 --> 00:59:34,577
Now!

870
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,976
Move along please.
Thank you.

871
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:42,438
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

872
00:59:42,438 --> 00:59:43,669
- I feel so stupid.
- No, no.

873
00:59:43,669 --> 00:59:44,808
It's a silly name for a dog,

874
00:59:44,808 --> 00:59:46,958
I should've been more clear.
You're doing a great job.

875
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,343
Danke.

876
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:51,938
Hiya, kid.

877
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:53,925
How can we help you today,
Master Betzler?

878
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,817
What's up?
Work with me.

879
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:59,028
If someone turned in a Jew,
would they get a medal or something?

880
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,369
Oh, Jews, Jews...
You still going on about those people?

881
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:04,416
You know, I'm preparing the city
for imminent invasion, right?

882
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:06,598
I'm tying the planet defense strategy.

883
01:00:06,598 --> 01:00:09,941
I've got Americans to the West.
Got Russians to the East.

884
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:13,146
My friend once met some Russians
and they ate him.

885
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,874
Who's the walnuts?

886
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:17,396
Walnuts are just walnuts, kid.

887
01:00:17,676 --> 01:00:19,012
What do you want
to talk about?

888
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,605
Well, I am learning a lot about Jews.

889
01:00:21,763 --> 01:00:24,656
Did you know,
Jews can read each others' minds?

890
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:27,350
And when they sleep,
they hang from the ceiling, like bats.

891
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:30,363
That's fascinating,
where did you come by this information?

892
01:00:32,998 --> 01:00:35,223
Research. I'm writing a book.

893
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:37,282
Oh, congratulations.
What's it called?

894
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:40,612
"Yoohoo Jew".
It's an exposé on Jews.

895
01:00:42,323 --> 01:00:44,951
You could also call it
"Who are you, Jew?".

896
01:00:45,693 --> 01:00:48,190
What about "Jews News"?

897
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,441
You do have
a wonderful imagination on you.

898
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,018
- It's real.
- Yeah, of course, it's real.

899
01:00:54,168 --> 01:00:57,514
When I was your age
I had an imaginary friend, called Conny.

900
01:00:57,514 --> 01:01:00,838
He used to wet my bed when I was asleep.
He got me in so much trouble.

901
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:03,703
Hey, come here, you might like to
check out what I'm working on.

902
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,080
As part of our preparations for the
invasion, I'm redesigning my uniform.

903
01:01:08,572 --> 01:01:12,663
Got the feathers for air dynamics.
The sparkly color to dazzle the enemy.

904
01:01:12,663 --> 01:01:14,496
The boots, purely decorative.

905
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:15,906
And this.

906
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:19,473
This is a Gatling gun,
mounted with a radio,

907
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:23,486
which emits annoying music
to dishearten the enemy.

908
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,606
This is all copyrighted, by the way.

909
01:01:25,606 --> 01:01:26,845
That means you can't copy it.

910
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:28,981
Yeah, don't give me ideas, kid.

911
01:01:31,925 --> 01:01:34,559
The kids are telling me
that your father is away fighting?

912
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,280
So, it appears you are now
the man of the house, how is that going?

913
01:01:38,507 --> 01:01:39,678
It's okay.

914
01:01:40,682 --> 01:01:41,804
Ja?

915
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,063
So, what jobs
do you have for me today?

916
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,829
I only got have one, I wouldn't lie.

917
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:47,898
It's a bit of a step-down
from what you used to, but

918
01:01:47,898 --> 01:01:50,662
we need all hands
on deck right now.

919
01:01:52,215 --> 01:01:54,019
Metal for Hitler.

920
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:56,992
Pots and pans for the war effort.

921
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:02,875
Here comes the metal man,
looking for your pots and pans.

922
01:02:02,946 --> 01:02:05,507
Metal for Hitler.

923
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:08,380
Pots and pans.

924
01:02:30,033 --> 01:02:32,469
Free Germany.

925
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:38,873
Jojo?

926
01:02:39,532 --> 01:02:40,575
Yorki?

927
01:02:40,575 --> 01:02:42,380
Hi!

928
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:47,155
You're a soldier now?

929
01:02:47,155 --> 01:02:48,589
At your service.

930
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:50,612
But you're only 11.

931
01:02:50,612 --> 01:02:51,787
I know.

932
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:53,516
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

933
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:55,235
Is that paper?

934
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,307
That's what I thought at first too,
but it's "paper-like".

935
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:02,665
It's the latest material,
invented by our top scientists.

936
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:05,358
Well, I'm impressed.

937
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:07,264
Hey, Yorki.

938
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:11,104
I caught a Jew. A real one.

939
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:12,591
A Jew?

940
01:03:12,591 --> 01:03:15,711
I saw some that they caught,
hiding in the Forrest last month.

941
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:18,855
Personally, I didn't see
what all the fuss was about.

942
01:03:18,981 --> 01:03:21,859
They weren't at all scary
and seemed, kind of, normal.

943
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:25,577
I'm getting distracted.
I got to go.

944
01:03:26,153 --> 01:03:28,052
Bye.

945
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:30,818
Oh my God.
It's so hard to run in this thing.

946
01:03:36,973 --> 01:03:38,160
I found these.

947
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:41,915
You can have them.
They're, probably, broken.

948
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:43,628
Doesn't mean anything.

949
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,352
Maybe, you can draw
something for my book.

950
01:03:49,297 --> 01:03:50,581
I could draw you again.

951
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,808
No one wants to see
pictures of cripples.

952
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:56,531
You're not a cripple.

953
01:03:57,995 --> 01:04:01,599
Besides, true artists
don't see that stuff.

954
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,146
Blind artists, you mean.

955
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:09,220
It's fine. I'll just accept I'll be one of
those guys who never get to kiss a girl.

956
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:12,270
You will be kissed, Jojo.

957
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:15,907
Do you want me to kiss you?

958
01:04:18,947 --> 01:04:20,130
Okay.

959
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,632
Two things.

960
01:04:21,957 --> 01:04:23,299
Thing number one.

961
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:28,241
It's illegal for Nazis and Jews
to hang out like we do, let alone kiss.

962
01:04:28,403 --> 01:04:29,478
Thing number two.

963
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:33,757
It'd just be a sympathy kiss,
which doesn't count.

964
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:37,634
You're not a Nazi.

965
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:41,677
I'm massively into swastikas, so, I think,
that's a pretty good sign right there.

966
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,965
You're not a Nazi, Jojo.

967
01:04:44,565 --> 01:04:49,236
You're a 10-year-old kid, who likes swastikas
and likes dressing up in a funny uniform,

968
01:04:49,236 --> 01:04:53,558
and wants to be part of a club.
But you're not one of them.

969
01:04:55,464 --> 01:04:56,626
Okay.

970
01:04:57,324 --> 01:05:01,010
Let's just agree to disagree,
all right?

971
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:03,852
Not a Nazi.

972
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:07,537
What a dirty Jew!

973
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,403
Come on, hide!
Hurry, go!

974
01:06:07,236 --> 01:06:08,520
Heil Hitler.

975
01:06:09,288 --> 01:06:13,772
Allow me to introduce myself, I am Captain
Herman Deertz of Falkenheim Gestapo.

976
01:06:13,772 --> 01:06:17,799
With me Herr Müller, Herr Junker,
Herr Klum, and Herr Frosch.

977
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,409
May we come in?

978
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:22,014
Thank you so much.

979
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:28,442
Heil Hitler.

980
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:54,466
Hey, Jojo.

981
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:57,113
Hey, guys.
Good to see you.

982
01:06:57,815 --> 01:07:01,130
My bicycle got a flat tire,
so I carried it.

983
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:02,545
Captain Klenzendorf?

984
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:08,205
Heil Hitler!

985
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:10,698
You know Freddie Finkel?

986
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:15,789
Heil Hitler.

987
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,945
So, did I miss anything?

988
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:21,939
No, no. We we just heil Hiltering the boy
and then heil Hiltering yourself,

989
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:24,342
and then, of course,
heil Hiltering Freddie Finkel,

990
01:07:24,342 --> 01:07:27,890
and now we in the midst of
a routine inspection.

991
01:07:28,456 --> 01:07:30,390
And what brings you here, captain?

992
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:36,182
We were just passing by, and we thought
we'd drop off some pamphlets for the boy.

993
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:37,878
He works for us.

994
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,537
I see.

995
01:07:41,908 --> 01:07:42,922
And yourself?

996
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:46,199
You know how it is.
Every day we take a call.

997
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:48,752
<i>Hello, is that the Gestapo?
I believe there's a Communist,</i>

998
01:07:48,752 --> 01:07:50,132
<i>hiding behind my fridge.</i>

999
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:53,089
We go around to investigate,
it's just some mold.

1000
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:54,980
So, not far off.

1001
01:07:55,557 --> 01:07:57,244
It's all part of the job.

1002
01:08:01,759 --> 01:08:04,568
Now, this is my kind
of little boy's bedroom.

1003
01:08:05,196 --> 01:08:07,635
Oh, yes. There he is.

1004
01:08:08,465 --> 01:08:12,315
You and your friends may have heard a rumor that
Hitler only has one ball, this is nonsense.

1005
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,130
He has four.

1006
01:08:15,241 --> 01:08:19,390
So, you are volunteering
at the Hitlerjugend office, yes?

1007
01:08:19,856 --> 01:08:20,840
Yes.

1008
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,467
Good for you.

1009
01:08:22,716 --> 01:08:26,512
I wish more of our young boys
had your blind fanaticism.

1010
01:08:28,618 --> 01:08:33,111
What on earth are those oafs up to?
Why don't we go upstairs and see, yes?

1011
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:41,232
Do you know where your mother is?

1012
01:08:42,094 --> 01:08:43,435
No.

1013
01:08:43,608 --> 01:08:45,240
I think she's in town.

1014
01:08:46,115 --> 01:08:48,451
Has she been spending
much time at home?

1015
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:51,417
She is quite busy.

1016
01:08:52,098 --> 01:08:53,462
Is she?

1017
01:08:56,295 --> 01:09:00,655
Well, I'm pleased to see that you're
wearing your Jugend uniform, but

1018
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,043
where is your knife?

1019
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:09,165
You must always carry your
DJ knife, where is it?

1020
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:10,716
I...

1021
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:12,585
Left...

1022
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:13,932
It's here.

1023
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,966
And who might you be?

1024
01:09:19,966 --> 01:09:21,531
And who might you be?

1025
01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:23,399
And what are you doing in my house?

1026
01:09:24,512 --> 01:09:25,934
You live here too?

1027
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:29,655
I'm his sister, Inga.

1028
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:33,029
Heil Hitler.

1029
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:45,703
Heil Hitler.

1030
01:09:46,323 --> 01:09:48,501
I did not know
you have a sister, Johannes.

1031
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:50,579
Sometimes he'd prefer
if I was dead.

1032
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:52,828
Isn't that right,
little Frankenstein?

1033
01:09:52,828 --> 01:09:57,813
Now, now, there's no need to attack his
hideous physical deformity.

1034
01:09:57,968 --> 01:09:59,999
That is a war wound.

1035
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:01,764
But...

1036
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:04,041
Why do you have his knife?

1037
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:08,161
I'm guarding my room,
because he refuses to stay out of it.

1038
01:10:08,382 --> 01:10:10,052
What do you have hidden in there?

1039
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:13,197
You know, girl's stuff.

1040
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,187
May I?

1041
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:17,493
Naturally.

1042
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:27,266
You see, we deal with
an inordinate number of reports,

1043
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:32,919
denunciations, and general investigations,
and, of course,

1044
01:10:32,919 --> 01:10:37,010
we are indeed interested in
problems of crime and anti party sentiment.

1045
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:43,321
But we still have one greater concern.
That's of the Goldilocksies,

1046
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:47,953
sneaking around,
eating other people's food.

1047
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:52,652
Sleeping in the beds,
it really is quite rude.

1048
01:10:54,175 --> 01:10:56,416
I don't suppose I could see
your papers, could I?

1049
01:10:57,977 --> 01:11:00,812
Papers, Miss Betzler.
Quickly, please, we don't have all day.

1050
01:11:01,913 --> 01:11:03,806
Yes, of course.

1051
01:11:41,644 --> 01:11:43,199
How old are you in this photo?

1052
01:11:45,485 --> 01:11:48,611
They're 3 years old, I was 14.

1053
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,310
Date of birth?

1054
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,201
1st of May. 1929.

1055
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:04,131
Correct. Thank you, Inga.

1056
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:06,895
Get a new photo,
you look like a ghost in this one.

1057
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:08,314
Wait!

1058
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:16,051
What is this?

1059
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,791
"Yoohoo Jew".

1060
01:12:22,322 --> 01:12:23,991
Tell me who did this.

1061
01:12:24,622 --> 01:12:25,890
I did.

1062
01:12:26,204 --> 01:12:30,064
It's an exposé on Jews.
How they think, behave,

1063
01:12:30,064 --> 01:12:32,980
look, it'll be a gift to the Führer.

1064
01:12:35,845 --> 01:12:37,395
Guys, you have to see this.

1065
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:40,456
Look at this one.
He has a tail.

1066
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,257
There's one of them,
hanging upside down like a bat.

1067
01:12:45,173 --> 01:12:48,131
This one here,
it is a drawing of their heads.

1068
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:50,858
And who is operating
the machinery of their brains?

1069
01:12:51,169 --> 01:12:54,491
The Devil.
It's funny 'cause it's true.

1070
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:59,087
Look at this little stupid Jew.
There they are with horns.

1071
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,407
What is this?

1072
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:05,433
Die Nathan, die.
Ways of killing Nathan.

1073
01:13:05,775 --> 01:13:08,820
Nathan, being tortured by snakes.
Poked with sticks.

1074
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,276
Being fired from a cannon.

1075
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,126
Just being cold names.

1076
01:13:13,647 --> 01:13:16,906
Nathan, being crushed under the wheel
of penny farthing bicycle.

1077
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:18,695
Who is Nathan, please?

1078
01:13:20,425 --> 01:13:21,805
Just some boy.

1079
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:24,639
Nathan, being roasted
over an open fire.

1080
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,360
It reminds me.
We must get back.

1081
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,676
Remember, 'cause we left
that guy, hanging up.

1082
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:31,109
Thank you for this,
you have really made my day.

1083
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:33,669
I do hope you continue with it.

1084
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:36,913
And, of course,
if you see anything suspicious

1085
01:13:37,085 --> 01:13:38,593
give us a ring.

1086
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,859
Good day.

1087
01:13:41,453 --> 01:13:44,202
Heil Hitler.

1088
01:13:52,031 --> 01:13:53,965
Nice to meet you, Inga.

1089
01:13:59,022 --> 01:14:00,292
Stay home, Jojo.

1090
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,836
Look after your family.
Look after this knife.

1091
01:14:24,704 --> 01:14:26,516
Elsa, you fooled them!

1092
01:14:27,553 --> 01:14:28,985
May 7th.

1093
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:31,557
What?

1094
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:35,411
She was born on the 7th.

1095
01:14:35,968 --> 01:14:37,104
Not the 1st.

1096
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:42,738
He was helping us.

1097
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:44,986
They'll be back.

1098
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:47,708
They'll figure out she's dead,
then I'll be dead.

1099
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,996
Nobody really knows Inga died.

1100
01:14:54,927 --> 01:14:57,053
You could be her.

1101
01:14:57,507 --> 01:14:59,686
I'll tell Mama everything
when she gets home.

1102
01:15:01,302 --> 01:15:04,865
That I know you,
and that we're friends.

1103
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,783
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

1104
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:18,944
Man, that was a complete bust.
Mind explaining that?

1105
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:20,865
She's not...

1106
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:24,388
She doesn't seem like a bad person.

1107
01:15:28,368 --> 01:15:33,199
I am beginning to question
your loyalty to myself and the party.

1108
01:15:33,949 --> 01:15:36,416
You call yourself a patriot?

1109
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:38,739
Yet, where is the evidence?

1110
01:15:38,884 --> 01:15:41,518
The German soldier
was born out of necessity.

1111
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,633
Germany depends on the passion
of these young men.

1112
01:15:44,633 --> 01:15:47,588
Passion and readiness
to fall for the Fatherland,

1113
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:52,231
despite the futile efforts
of ally war profiteers,

1114
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:57,222
who send their ill-prepared armies,
clumsily, into the lair of the wolf.

1115
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:01,219
And only zealous men, who stand
steadfast in the face of the enemy

1116
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:03,904
will be etched in German memory forever.

1117
01:16:04,609 --> 01:16:08,864
And it is up to you to decide
if you want to be remembered,

1118
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,175
or disappear without a trace,

1119
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:16,081
like a pitiful grain of sand
into a dessert of insignificance.

1120
01:16:20,928 --> 01:16:22,252
To put it plainly.

1121
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:26,134
Get your shit together
and sort out your priorities.

1122
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,131
You're 10, Jojo.

1123
01:16:28,772 --> 01:16:30,801
Start acting like it.

1124
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,002
Did you know?

1125
01:20:45,082 --> 01:20:46,862
She didn't tell me much.

1126
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:49,603
Only that she worked
with her friends

1127
01:20:49,603 --> 01:20:51,981
and your father was,
somehow, involved from afar.

1128
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:55,772
No, he's fighting in the war.

1129
01:20:57,932 --> 01:21:00,744
She said he'll be home
as soon as the war is over.

1130
01:21:01,704 --> 01:21:04,426
She didn't want to tell you anything
for obvious reasons.

1131
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:08,060
Because she hated me.

1132
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:11,750
'Cause I'm a Nazi.
I'm the enemy.

1133
01:21:12,189 --> 01:21:14,929
She didn't want you to know anything
that could get you in trouble.

1134
01:21:15,756 --> 01:21:17,654
But now I have nothing.

1135
01:21:19,644 --> 01:21:21,117
No one.

1136
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:28,095
The last time I saw my parents
was at the station.

1137
01:21:29,763 --> 01:21:31,600
They were put on the train.

1138
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:35,616
I ran.

1139
01:21:36,387 --> 01:21:38,951
Slowly, found my way
back to the city.

1140
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:42,051
A friend of my father's hid me.

1141
01:21:42,051 --> 01:21:44,429
Then, another friend,
then friends of friends...

1142
01:21:47,006 --> 01:21:48,818
Till your mother took me in.

1143
01:21:51,737 --> 01:21:53,708
And so far I am still here.

1144
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:00,406
But my parents went to a place
you don't come back from.

1145
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:07,533
What's the first thing you'll do
when you're free?

1146
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:12,404
Dance.

Jojo!

1173
01:24:31,952 --> 01:24:33,188
Oh God.

1174
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:36,615
Jojo! Oh, I've missed you!

1175
01:24:37,803 --> 01:24:39,513
Sorry about your mama.

1176
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:42,552
I cried for ages,
when I heard what happened.

1177
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:45,806
What's going on out here?

1178
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:48,170
The Russians, Jojo.
They're coming.

1179
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,270
And the Americans from the other way.

1180
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,811
And England, and China.

1181
01:24:51,811 --> 01:24:55,448
And Africa, and India.
The whole world is coming.

1182
01:24:55,711 --> 01:24:57,451
Help me with this ammo.

1183
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:00,433
And how are we doing?

1184
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:03,117
Terribly.
Our only friends are the Japanese.

1185
01:25:03,258 --> 01:25:06,380
And just between you and me,
they don't look very Aryan.

1186
01:25:07,326 --> 01:25:09,114
Remember that Jew,
I told you about?

1187
01:25:09,114 --> 01:25:10,721
- Oh yeah.
- I still have her.

1188
01:25:10,721 --> 01:25:12,502
She's, basically, my girlfriend now.

1189
01:25:12,502 --> 01:25:15,338
Oh, good for you, Jojo.
A girlfriend.

1190
01:25:15,338 --> 01:25:18,758
But, you know, she is Jewish.

1191
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:21,809
There are bigger things to worry about
than Jews, Jojo.

1192
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:24,000
There are Russians
somewhere out there.

1193
01:25:24,339 --> 01:25:25,817
They are worse than anyone.

1194
01:25:26,106 --> 01:25:29,130
I heard they eat babies
and have sex with dogs.

1195
01:25:29,552 --> 01:25:31,379
I mean, like, that's bad, right?

1196
01:25:31,638 --> 01:25:32,864
Sex with dogs?

1197
01:25:32,864 --> 01:25:34,940
Yeah, the Englishmen do it too.

1198
01:25:35,234 --> 01:25:38,431
We have to stop them before they eat us
and screw all our dogs.

1199
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:42,580
It's crazy. And now Hitler's gone.
We're really on our own.

1200
01:25:44,827 --> 01:25:45,874
What?

1201
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,219
You didn't hear?

1202
01:25:47,837 --> 01:25:49,148
He's dead.

1203
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:51,625
He gave up and blew his brains out.

1204
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:54,288
No! That's impossible.

1205
01:25:54,288 --> 01:25:56,778
Blew them out. His brains.

1206
01:25:57,548 --> 01:25:59,783
Turns out, he was hiding
a lot of stuff from us.

1207
01:25:59,783 --> 01:26:02,658
Doing some really bad things
behind everyone's backs.

1208
01:26:02,869 --> 01:26:05,166
I'm not sure if we'll survive attacks.

1209
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:21,431
Okay. Come here.

1210
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:24,122
Okay. See that American there?
Just go give him a hug.

1211
01:26:24,122 --> 01:26:25,994
Go! Run!
Let's go!

1212
01:26:26,553 --> 01:26:27,843
Oh, Yorki, Yorki.

1213
01:26:28,064 --> 01:26:30,944
Great news, you've just been promoted
and you get you own pistol.

1214
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:33,475
Just go and shoot anybody
who looks different to us.

1215
01:26:33,475 --> 01:26:34,367
Okay.

1216
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:37,584
Jojo, where's your uniform?

1217
01:26:39,364 --> 01:26:42,987
Here, put this jacket on,
so they know not to shoot you.

1218
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,326
We must kill everything that we see.

1219
01:26:46,765 --> 01:26:47,919
Heil Hitler!

1220
01:26:49,177 --> 01:26:51,111
Die, devil's tongue.

1221
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:55,256
Yeah, we'll check him.

1222
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:35,593
Hey! Hey!

1223
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:40,376
What?

1224
01:30:41,505 --> 01:30:43,488
I don't understand.

1225
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:55,939
Captain K.

1226
01:30:55,939 --> 01:30:59,518
Hiya, kid.
Look at all this commotion.

1227
01:30:59,828 --> 01:31:00,956
What's happening?

1228
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:03,727
Hysteria, my friend.
We come to the end.

1229
01:31:04,011 --> 01:31:05,204
Party's over.

1230
01:31:06,305 --> 01:31:08,666
Are you scared?
Don't be scared.

1231
01:31:08,815 --> 01:31:09,973
Look at me.

1232
01:31:13,577 --> 01:31:16,204
I'm sorry about Rosie,
she was a good person.

1233
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,256
An actual good person.

1234
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,471
Okay?

1235
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:28,809
It's okay, kid.

1236
01:31:33,178 --> 01:31:36,094
I've been meaning to tell you.
I think your book is really great.

1237
01:31:36,893 --> 01:31:38,624
I'm sorry for laughing at it.

1238
01:31:38,933 --> 01:31:40,478
Very creative.

1239
01:31:40,649 --> 01:31:42,371
Come here, let's take a look at you.

1240
01:31:43,222 --> 01:31:45,557
You look good.
You're okay, kid.

1241
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,763
Now, go home.
Look after that sister of yours.

1242
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:51,129
Okay?

1243
01:31:52,528 --> 01:31:53,429
Get away!

1244
01:31:53,569 --> 01:31:54,824
Get away, Jew!

1245
01:31:55,995 --> 01:31:56,540
Get away!

1246
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,636
What's going on?

1247
01:31:57,636 --> 01:31:58,449
It's a Jew!

1248
01:31:58,449 --> 01:32:00,141
Shut up! You know this Nazi?

1249
01:32:00,141 --> 01:32:00,728
He...

1250
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:02,229
I don't know this dirty Jew.

1251
01:32:03,145 --> 01:32:05,635
- Get away, Jew!
- Shut your mouth, Nazi!

1252
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:08,889
- No!
- Get out of here!

1253
01:32:08,902 --> 01:32:10,076
Go home!

1254
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,838
- Leave him alone!
- Go home!

1255
01:32:16,178 --> 01:32:18,419
Get out of here! Go home!

1256
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:34,663
Jojo?

1257
01:32:37,551 --> 01:32:38,820
Yorki!

1258
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:41,041
Thank God!

1259
01:32:41,477 --> 01:32:42,616
I thought you were dead.

1260
01:32:42,616 --> 01:32:44,769
No, it seems like I can never die.

1261
01:32:45,573 --> 01:32:47,562
I'm gonna go home
to see my mother.

1262
01:32:48,218 --> 01:32:49,621
I need a cuddle.

1263
01:32:49,908 --> 01:32:51,290
Nothing makes sense anymore.

1264
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:54,586
Yeah, it's, definitely
not a good time to be a Nazi.

1265
01:32:55,397 --> 01:32:59,507
Hey, so now the war is over,
at least your girlfriend will be free.

1266
01:33:00,263 --> 01:33:01,985
She can leave now.

1267
01:33:03,334 --> 01:33:04,389
Is something wrong?

1268
01:33:05,637 --> 01:33:07,176
I've got to go.

1269
01:33:07,176 --> 01:33:08,825
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1270
01:34:01,357 --> 01:34:03,294
Hi, I'm home.

1271
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:04,698
What's going on out there?

1272
01:34:07,902 --> 01:34:09,200
Out where?

1273
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,315
Outside, dummy.

1274
01:34:12,859 --> 01:34:14,799
Jojo, what's going on?

1275
01:34:16,497 --> 01:34:18,390
Is it safe to come out?

1276
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:23,373
Jojo, is it safe?

1277
01:34:24,514 --> 01:34:26,214
Can I leave?

1278
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:29,150
No.

1279
01:34:33,632 --> 01:34:35,417
You can't leave.

1280
01:34:35,742 --> 01:34:36,839
Why?

1281
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:39,153
You have to stay here.

1282
01:34:39,328 --> 01:34:40,497
Who won?

1283
01:34:40,659 --> 01:34:42,175
With me.

1284
01:34:42,571 --> 01:34:44,702
Jojo, who won?
Who won the war?

1285
01:34:49,103 --> 01:34:50,540
We did.

1286
01:34:54,107 --> 01:34:56,749
Germany won the war.

1287
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,246
I'm sorry.

1288
01:36:30,623 --> 01:36:35,208
<i>Dear Elsa, I know it's hard for you
at the moment.</i>

1289
01:36:36,453 --> 01:36:38,486
<i>And I know you feel like giving up.</i>

1290
01:36:39,797 --> 01:36:41,553
<i>But you have to carry on.</i>

1291
01:36:42,008 --> 01:36:46,212
<i>Me and your good friend Jojo,
have devised a plan for you to escape.</i>

1292
01:36:47,567 --> 01:36:49,706
<i>So, please, listen to him.</i>

1293
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:52,273
<i>He's gonna help you
to get out of there.</i>

1294
01:36:52,445 --> 01:36:54,689
<i>And then you could come
be with me in Paris.</i>

1295
01:36:57,064 --> 01:36:58,849
<i>Don't worry about Jojo.</i>

1296
01:37:02,623 --> 01:37:04,412
<i>He'll be okay.</i>

1297
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:09,344
<i>See you in Paris. Nathan.</i>

1298
01:37:18,814 --> 01:37:19,772
He's dead.

1299
01:37:20,052 --> 01:37:21,100
Pardon?

1300
01:37:21,534 --> 01:37:22,816
Nathan.

1301
01:37:23,133 --> 01:37:27,178
He died last year. Tuberculosis.

1302
01:37:30,122 --> 01:37:31,298
Well...

1303
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,655
That's weird.
Who wrote these?

1304
01:37:37,459 --> 01:37:39,285
Thank you, Jojo.

1305
01:37:42,604 --> 01:37:44,557
You've been so good to me.

1306
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:49,379
Well...
Thing is...

1307
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:51,460
I love you.

1308
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:55,564
I know you think of me
as a younger brother, which is fine.

1309
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:56,637
And...

1310
01:37:57,396 --> 01:37:58,754
You're too old anyway.

1311
01:37:59,073 --> 01:38:00,305
But...

1312
01:38:01,562 --> 01:38:03,433
Man, it's quite hot in here.

1313
01:38:05,603 --> 01:38:07,043
I love you too.

1314
01:38:07,043 --> 01:38:09,372
- As a younger brother?
- Yes, as a younger brother.

1315
01:38:09,954 --> 01:38:14,165
Look, me and fake Nathan
have found a way for you to escape.

1316
01:38:16,837 --> 01:38:18,787
Maybe, you can trust
your younger brother?

1317
01:38:20,523 --> 01:38:21,821
Maybe.

1318
01:38:23,615 --> 01:38:25,054
Okay then.

1319
01:38:25,054 --> 01:38:28,237
Get your things together.
We're leaving.

1320
01:38:35,306 --> 01:38:39,628
Jojo Betzler.
Ten and a half years old.

1321
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:44,192
Today, just do what you can.

1322
01:38:46,714 --> 01:38:48,831
Where, in a shit,
do you think you're going?

1323
01:38:49,781 --> 01:38:51,040
- Out.
- Out?

1324
01:38:51,184 --> 01:38:52,443
Oh no, you don't.

1325
01:38:52,704 --> 01:38:55,386
Now, we gonna stay in here,
and you gonna tell me exactly

1326
01:38:55,386 --> 01:38:58,315
what's going on with you
and that thing it the attic.

1327
01:38:58,315 --> 01:39:00,072
That thing is a girl.

1328
01:39:00,072 --> 01:39:01,662
You're in love with her, aren't you?

1329
01:39:01,662 --> 01:39:02,164
Yes.

1330
01:39:02,164 --> 01:39:03,932
- Admit it!
- I just said yes.

1331
01:39:03,932 --> 01:39:05,409
I knew it!

1332
01:39:06,718 --> 01:39:08,462
It was never gonna work out.

1333
01:39:09,304 --> 01:39:12,026
And you. No, she's too old for you.
And you're ugly.

1334
01:39:12,741 --> 01:39:14,988
No, she's gonna leave you,
you that, don't you?

1335
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:17,781
So, here's what's gonna happen,
you little shit.

1336
01:39:18,343 --> 01:39:20,343
You gonna put this on, okay?

1337
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:23,723
You gonna forget about that
disgusting Jewy cow up there.

1338
01:39:23,723 --> 01:39:26,739
And you gonna come back to me,
where you belong.

1339
01:39:27,164 --> 01:39:28,382
All right?

1340
01:39:28,612 --> 01:39:29,787
Put it on!

1341
01:39:30,329 --> 01:39:32,977
And then, we gonna pretend
none of this ever happened.

1342
01:39:32,977 --> 01:39:34,144
You got it?

1343
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:46,067
Heil me? For old time sake?
Heil me, little man.

1344
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:47,005
No.

1345
01:39:47,005 --> 01:39:48,442
- Heil me.
- No.

1346
01:39:48,442 --> 01:39:50,380
Just a little heil. Please.

1347
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:51,960
Fuck off, Hitler!

1348
01:40:01,481 --> 01:40:02,660
Come on.

1349
01:40:05,659 --> 01:40:07,113
Oh, wait.

1350
01:40:22,113 --> 01:40:23,659
Ready?

1351
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:25,098
Yeah.

1352
01:40:29,537 --> 01:40:31,505
Is it dangerous out there?

1353
01:40:34,884 --> 01:40:37,154
Extremely.

1354
01:41:36,531 --> 01:41:38,252
We made it.

1355
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:44,623
Probably, deserved that.

1356
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,288
What do we do now?

1357
01:42:53,559 --> 01:42:57,842
