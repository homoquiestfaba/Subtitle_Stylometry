1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,360
Some people have
the simplest of dreams:

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,871
Get married, have babies...

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,305
Don't get me wrong,
there's nothing wrong with that.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,866
It's just not for me.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,935
I have plans, big plans.

6
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,038
I don't know what
the fuck your problem is.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,786
Sorry.

8
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,807
But 12 people voted him guilty.

9
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,605
- On circumstantial evidence.
- 12 people, Sofía.

10
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,771
12 people convicted
a man solely on assumptions.

11
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,303
Is that just?

12
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,556
This is just one case.

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,285
We need to move on
with the assignments.

14
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,316
How can I be in law school
without a point of view?

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,497
Well, we need a consensus
so we can move on, okay?

16
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,830
I don't agree.

17
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,768
You know, I can't stay here
past 3:00 in the morning.

18
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,762
Some of us have a life.

19
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,578
Wonderful.

20
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,773
You're gonna be
an excellent lawyer, Richard.

21
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,648
I speak Spanish, Sofía.

22
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,851
I've always wanted to study in America
and become a lawyer.

23
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,886
Not just any lawyer,
but someone important,

24
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,025
like Benjamin Cardozo,
Clarence Darrow

25
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:45,003
and Gloria, Gloria Allred.

26
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,598
I have to stay focused.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,108
I tell myself that all the time.

28
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,787
For God's sake.

29
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,759
Jeez, Monica.

30
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,939
This is my cousin, Monica.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,312
When we were little girls
growing up in Colombia,

32
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,681
people used to think
we were twins.

33
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,449
To stay in America and follow her
lifelong dream of becoming a pop star,

34
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,286
she married Harmless George.

35
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,316
Monica María, that's the last straw.
You're driving me crazy, man.

36
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,090
- So what else is new?
- Please.

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,194
I need it quiet.
I need to study. You promised.

38
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,999
Are you listening?

39
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,029
This is Harmless George.

40
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,800
Monica told me if I came to America,

41
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,041
I, too, could find and marry
my very own Harmless George.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,275
No sex, no strings...

43
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,307
just a green ticket
to a dream, she said.

44
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,514
Assholes are assholes,
no excuses.

45
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,257
- Come see me tonight.
- No, you know I have to study.

46
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,486
Stop studying.

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,357
- Okay, are you done with the music now?
- Yes.

48
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,794
- Okay.
- Hey.

49
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,093
Relax. Be like me for once.

50
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,463
Never, ever.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,196
- You don't know what you're missing.
- Thanks.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,766
Jesse?

53
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,273
It's just a dream, Sofía.

54
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,675
This is my Harmless George.

55
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,203
Only his name isn't George.

56
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,079
And he certainly isn't harmless.

57
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,012
My green card husband, Jesse,
is about to rob me

58
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,714
of everything I ever owned...

59
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,191
my furniture, my books, my dream.

60
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,060
And here is where
my story begins.

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,123
No, I want the futon.

62
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,760
- Dude, she's sleeping on it, Jesse.
- I don't... I want it.

63
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,704
- It'll wake her up.
- I don't care, I want it.

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,800
Dude, it'll wake her up.
She'll throw all of our asses in jail.

65
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,065
Did you see that look?

66
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,160
- What look?
- She gave me a look.

67
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,398
She's obviously into me.

68
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,428
I didn't see shit.

69
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,101
He took everything, Monica...
my books, my furniture.

70
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,078
All I have is my pillow.

71
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,546
He even took Gloria Allred, Monica.
Gloria.

72
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,776
- Ah, the piece of shit.
- So get it back. Call the cops.

73
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,944
I can't. I can't.

74
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,079
He'll file for divorce
and I'll loose my green card,

75
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,952
because we haven't been married
long enough,

76
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,288
and I'll have to quit school,
and I'll be deported.

77
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,384
Oh, come on, honey,
now they wouldn't deport you.

78
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,487
Yeah, don't they take you
to an INS prison first?

79
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,090
Look, Sofía, you're stronger
than this, okay?

80
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,861
You're the strongest girl I know.

81
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,667
Okay? Sofía.
Sofía? Listen to me.

82
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,537
You're beautiful, you're smart.
You'll figure this one out.

83
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,371
You always do. You always do.

84
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,434
Monica, Monica...

85
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,776
- I have no books.
- Borrow from a friend.

86
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,805
- I have no computer.
- You'll share mine.

87
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,840
- I have no bed, Monica.
- You'll share mine.

88
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,943
Now you believe Jesse
is an asshole?

89
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,544
I don't understand
why he would do this.

90
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,180
- Why?
- Because he's an asshole.

91
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,191
How many times
do I have to say it?

92
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,318
Okay, go ahead, say it.

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,761
He is an asshole.

94
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,958
Just say...

95
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,626
- Shit.
- She's right, Sofía.

96
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,364
But let it go.
Fuck.

97
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,167
I feel better already.

98
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,299
Fuck.
Even better. Come on.

99
00:07:55,341 --> 00:08:01,109
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...
- Please, please, please, please...

100
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,139
Have a drink. Hey.
Have a drink.

101
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,048
You two sound like dirty chickens.
Please.

102
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,916
- A drink?
- Get a drink.

103
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,478
- Ergo.
- I have to go, I have to go.

104
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,184
- I have nothing to eat.
- Call me. Everything will be okay.

105
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,489
- Excuse me.
- Get the fuck off me.

106
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,691
Notice how she slipped
in the word "fuck. "

107
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,722
Yeah.

108
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,228
Another tequila,
another sparkling water.

109
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,340
Why am I always
the designated driver?

110
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,535
Because I'm a tormented artist.

111
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,869
Look at it this way,

112
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,176
if I wasn't drunk,
you wouldn't have a shot at me.

113
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,239
Are you saying
I have a shot at you?

114
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,379
Oh, George, you know I've always
been attracted to intelligent men.

115
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,719
This is just in case you somehow
miraculously manage

116
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,161
to utter something
remotely intelligent.

117
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,262
Typically I'm a magnum man,
but I can improvise.

118
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,634
$21.72.

119
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,675
- I'm sorry, it's rejecting.
- Impossible.

120
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,914
Can you try again, please?

121
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,513
I pay in full every month.

122
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,395
Nope. Got another card?

123
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,722
ATM.

124
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,601
Says that you have no funds.

125
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,936
No, that's... it's impossible.

126
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,410
It's impossible. I have...

127
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,175
Thank you.

128
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,864
Jesse, come out.

129
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,302
I have a sh... a gun.

130
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,431
I bought one today.

131
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,126
Your son has my key
and my doughnuts.

132
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,389
What?

133
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,096
Your son...
stop.

134
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,763
You're eating my evidence.

135
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,300
Max.

136
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,209
Get out here.

137
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,041
Did you steal these
from this lady?

138
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,414
She said I could have them.

139
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,550
Tell the truth.

140
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,048
- Just give me my key back.
- I don't have the key anymore.

141
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,118
Sir, listen... I've had
a very, very, very bad day.

142
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,757
I just want my key
and my doughnuts, please.

143
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,826
- Give her the key.
- I don't have the key anymore.

144
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,893
Max.

145
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,462
I threw it down the garbage chute.

146
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,501
Go to your room.

147
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,274
I'll deal with you later.

148
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,498
Done.

149
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,025
Here.

150
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,834
Okay, thank you very much.

151
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,038
Hello.

152
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,410
You're coming out.

153
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,777
From Colombia. Yeah.
Never been to Europe.

154
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,878
I have just one more question:

155
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,446
The restaurant is packed,
you're in the weeds. What do you do?

156
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,787
What do you do?
What do you do?

157
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,656
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

158
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,321
What is this... weeds?

159
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,798
It's a restaurant term. You have
too many tables, your hands are full,

160
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,062
you're in the weeds,
you're in the weeds.

161
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,363
What do you do?
What do you do?

162
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,331
That's a trick question.

163
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,274
I would never be in the weeds.
I'm too good of a waitress.

164
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,402
- I am.
- I don't know.

165
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,643
Uh, not the answer
I was looking for... at all.

166
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,810
But I like it.
When can you start?

167
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,786
I got the job?
I got the job?

168
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,982
Yeah, I'm gonna
have you train with María.

169
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,014
I'm gonna start you
on the lunch shift.

170
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,357
Oh, no, no. I can't work lunch,
only dinner.

171
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,955
I'm in school during the day.
Unless weekends.

172
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,932
Oh, no, no, no.
No, all we have is the lunch shift.

173
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,366
Thank you.
Thanks.

174
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,565
Thanks.
Sal.

175
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,583
You never threw it
down the garbage chute, did you?

176
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,710
Did too. Went and got it.

177
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,415
Where did all your stuff go?

178
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,754
I knew it. You've been
in my place before.

179
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,282
What happened to your face?

180
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,921
Nothing. Got into a fight.

181
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,555
When?

182
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,589
In school.

183
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,157
Today's Saturday.

184
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,429
So?

185
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,403
So you didn't
have a bruise yesterday,

186
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,133
so we both know
it didn't happen in school.

187
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:46,133
I said, a kid from school.
Happened this morning.

188
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,408
Charlie sucker-punched me

189
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,939
when I was sitting here,
minding my own beeswax.

190
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,481
Well, have your mother
put some ice on it.

191
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,716
And stay out of trouble.

192
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,233
Hello. Can't come to the phone.
Leave a message.

193
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,665
Hello. Can't come to the phone.
Leave a message.

194
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,832
Sofía.

195
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,503
What happened?

196
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,909
My car broke down
and I'm in the middle of nowhere.

197
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,936
Okay, stay calm.
Where are you?

198
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,643
Corner of Fifth and Patterson.

199
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,982
Okay. I'll be right there.
Stay in your car.

200
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,386
Hurry. I think I saw
a guy with a gun.

201
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,287
I'm out the door.

202
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,983
- Goody.
- Monica María.

203
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,824
Not even close to being funny.

204
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,659
You would've never opened
the door for me.

205
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,665
George and I are getting drunk,
I'm buying.

206
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,100
- No, I can't.
- You need this. Trust me.

207
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,696
Okay, but I'm not drinking.

208
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,674
Up, down, center, in.

209
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,886
How stupid it will look?

210
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,662
Sofía, I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,568
Why is my shirt all wet?

212
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,503
Just some saliva

213
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,131
came out of your mouth.

214
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,577
And my pants?

215
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,842
You may have peed a little.

216
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,042
It's a natural thing
when you get knocked out.

217
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,884
You momentarily lost all control
of your bodily fluids.

218
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,786
It happens all the time.

219
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,586
- See? Not a big thing.
- Monica María,

220
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,023
in front of everybody?

221
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,754
Hey, nobody important saw.

222
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,853
Where's my car?
My car?

223
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,557
George is following.

224
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,929
Does he even know
how to drive a stick?

225
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,661
Of course.

226
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,232
Come on.

227
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,171
Damn it.

228
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,938
I know that's first.

229
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,941
Miss Garcí...

230
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,650
Ah, you.

231
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,143
I know you?

232
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,122
Last night, the tavern.

233
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,489
We... met briefly.

234
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,391
We did?

235
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,827
A short conversation.

236
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,492
- Did I say something rude?
- Rude?

237
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,001
No, no.
Let me think of what it is,

238
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,595
because it was actually quite clever.
It was kind of like a haiku.

239
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,333
It was something like...

240
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,738
"Hey you, get the fuck off me. "

241
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,445
I'm very sorry.

242
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,846
No, it's okay. I was just trying
to let you know that you had

243
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,078
a three-foot trail of toilet paper
hanging from your foot.

244
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,315
Listen, I thought
you were hitting on me.

245
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,152
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no, no.

246
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,181
I was just trying to help you.

247
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,991
I'm a doctor.
That's what I do.

248
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,366
Please, forgive me.
Okay?

249
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,229
- You're forgiven.
- Okay.

250
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,728
So. You and your girlfriend
bumped heads on the dance floor,

251
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,502
- is that right?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,907
I haven't had a very good day.

253
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,434
Doesn't sound like it.
Oh, there it is.

254
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,242
I'm sorry to hear that.

255
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,841
All right.
Watch my pen, okay?

256
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,446
Like that, like that,

257
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,718
down and come back up.

258
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,282
Nice. Around, seeing
if you're "The Exorcist. "

259
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,055
Okay, fabulous. Now watch.

260
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,527
Look at me.

261
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,054
Look at me.

262
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,963
Looking at me.
No, look forward.

263
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,093
Look at me. Is English
your second language?

264
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,099
I'm just kidding.
I'm teasing you.

265
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,073
All right, just keep looking at me.

266
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,905
Very nice, I'm gonna look
in that ear.

267
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,206
That ear's fine.

268
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,975
Look in this ear, and...
oh God.

269
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,141
I'm kidding, you're fine.

270
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,983
Everything's fine.
You have a mild concussion

271
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,681
and a little bump
on your head.

272
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,054
- What should I do?
- Put some ice on it,

273
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,922
don't go to sleep
for a couple hours

274
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,258
and for God's sake,
fire your choreographer.

275
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,772
What?

276
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,969
What?

277
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,273
Nothing. You're free to go.

278
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,849
Take two aspirin and call me.

279
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,379
Aren't you supposed to say
call you in the morning?

280
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,221
Oh God, no.
Don't call me in the morning.

281
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,125
I'm not a morning person.
I get a little grumpy.

282
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,924
But anytime after that,

283
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,926
give me a call.

284
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,695
- Miss García.
- Yes?

285
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,966
I lied before.

286
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,171
My intention was to hit on you.

287
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,906
Okay. So I was right
to say "F... off. "

288
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,244
- F... off?
- F... off.

289
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,842
Yeah, but I was hitting on you
in a nice way.

290
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,818
You seem like a nice person.

291
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,180
That's very sweet,

292
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,488
but things are a little crazy
for me right now.

293
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,050
So...

294
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,590
But thank you.

295
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,895
It was very nice
meeting you, Doctor.

296
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,163
Seriously.

297
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,035
- And thank you for checking my bump.
- Not a problem.

298
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,834
Have dinner with me.

299
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,865
No.

300
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,641
We don't even
have to sit at the same table.

301
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,739
We could just sit
at separate tables, very innocent.

302
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,682
You know, just wave at me
from across the room.

303
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,048
- Let me know you care.
- No.

304
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,019
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe just...

305
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,614
- a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you very much.

306
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,624
Thank you.
You actually make me smile.

307
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,148
- Seriously, thank...
- Neil.

308
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,096
No, don't kneel.
My name is Neil.

309
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,766
Okay. Goodbye.

310
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,499
Over there.

311
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,700
- Bye, Miss García.
- Bye.

312
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,506
Don't forget about the aspirin.

313
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,379
- Was he cute?
- Sort of.

314
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,344
- George, pull over.
- He could be a maniac.

315
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,581
He looks harmless, pull over.

316
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,922
Hello. Hi.

317
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,794
Thank you so much for stopping.

318
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,925
The cell phone doesn't work here,

319
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,935
otherwise we would've
called our mechanic.

320
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,403
Anyhoo, the bugger
seems to have stalled.

321
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,905
Don't know much
about cars myself,

322
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,135
but the wife thinks
it should be pop-started.

323
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,268
That's Helen in the car there.

324
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,973
Darling, give these lovely people
a quick wave.

325
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,314
I can assure you
that wasn't intended for you.

326
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,154
Yes, she's in a bit
of a hurry to get home.

327
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:17,821
Anyhoo, I think if you can get
up to about 25 to 35 miles an hour,

328
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,626
we should be on our way.

329
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,894
- 25 to 35?
- Uh huh.

330
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,993
Doesn't that seem
a tad fast?

331
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,833
No, no, I think you'd need
that kind of speed

332
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,636
to generate enough force
to pop-start the gears.

333
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,438
- George.
- Ay, George, please.

334
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,445
Thank you so much.

335
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,046
That's odd.

336
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,422
Why's that chap
backing the car up?

337
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,290
- What's he doing?
- Why's he backing up the car?

338
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,488
25 to 35.

339
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,822
All right.

340
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,692
- Stop. Stop.
- Stop. Stop.

341
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,433
Bloody moron.
He's gonna kill us.

342
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:20,853
You have gotta be the worst
designated driver in history.

343
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,292
Screw you, Monica.

344
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,353
I did what the man
asked me to do.

345
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:29,697
Excuse me, but I certainly
did not ask you to ram us from behind.

346
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,897
Did you or did you not ask me
to get the car up to 35 miles per hour?

347
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,805
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but is it my imagination,

348
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,775
or are you a total idiot?

349
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,505
We've tested him.
He is an idiot.

350
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:45,005
Sir, you should be thanking me
for stopping in the first place.

351
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,712
You didn't even
wanna stop, George.

352
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,219
Sofía told you to.

353
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,191
Excuse me, ma'am,
but I have a touch of asthma.

354
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,724
Don't you have an inhaler
or something?

355
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,358
No, I don't have one.

356
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,268
Well how about a mask
or a scarf?

357
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,704
- Darling, darling.
- What an old bitch.

358
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,437
I'll pay you for everything, Sofía.

359
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,207
- How, George?
- Somehow.

360
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,738
How, George? How are you
gonna pay for it, huh?

361
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,808
Would you please shut your ass?

362
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,649
This is none of your business.

363
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,053
Don't tell me
to shut my ass, asshole.

364
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,888
- Shut your ass. Shut your ass.
- You stupid asshole...

365
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,393
Can you drop it?

366
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,520
I can't be offended
'cause I don't understand you.

367
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,690
- Of course, you...
- All right, all right.

368
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,257
Nobody needs to shut
anybody else's ass, all right?

369
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,030
Their own, anybody... whatever.

370
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,799
No more asses.
Just behave, please.

371
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,731
What?

372
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,582
My insurance will cover this, sir.

373
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,315
Thank you.

374
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,482
Very nice young lady.

375
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,086
Sofía, your car is totalled.

376
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,895
And my rent is due,

377
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,368
so I'm sure they're gonna
throw me out of the apartment.

378
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,200
No way.
What are you gonna do?

379
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,077
I'm gonna drop out of law school
and go back to Colombia.

380
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,606
No way, Sofía.
Come on.

381
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,311
This is none of my business,

382
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,616
but do you actually want
to drop out of law school

383
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,849
and go back to... Guatemala, or...

384
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,050
- Colombia.
- Colombia.

385
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,322
What does it matter, anyway?
It's down there somewhere.

386
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,591
Do you?

387
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,925
No.

388
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,731
So, just because of this
fender-bender?

389
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,432
Seems a bit drastic,
if you don't mind me saying so.

390
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,599
I've had a very, very bad day.

391
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,878
Honey, the bright side of this:
It couldn't get any worse.

392
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,228
But how could my insurance
be canceled?

393
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:00,540
But how could my insurance
be canceled?

394
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,145
Your husband
canceled the policy yesterday.

395
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,918
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

396
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,284
God.

397
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,462
Hello, I can't come to the phone.
Leave a message. Bye.

398
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,133
Sofía? Frank Bauman here.

399
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,303
I have some rather troubling news.

400
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,176
I got in touch
with your insurance company

401
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,273
and they told me
you're not covered.

402
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,150
But I think I have a solution,
so if you'd please ring me back

403
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:40,123
at 555-2341. Thanks.

404
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,156
You canceled my car insurance?
Why?

405
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,720
Why are you doing this to me?
Please tell me.

406
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,257
- Shit happens.
- I'm gonna call the police.

407
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,360
Are you listening?
I don't care what happens to me.

408
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,429
Not everything in life
goes according to plan.

409
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,133
What?

410
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,574
I married you, Sofía,
because we were friends

411
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,511
and I wanted to help, and I thought
something special could come of it.

412
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,241
You married me to get laid.

413
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,580
What did you think
I meant by something special?

414
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,951
I'm changing the locks,
so don't bother breaking in again.

415
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,785
I already got everything I want.

416
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,149
Whose car is that?

417
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,919
What car?

418
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,658
That car.

419
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,292
- I don't see any car.
- The same BMW

420
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,801
that I always dreamt of owning.

421
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,064
Whose car is that?

422
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,470
I don't see any car.
Hey, Tony.

423
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,407
- Yeah?
- You see anything out in the driveway?

424
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,001
Nope.

425
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,069
See, Sofía?

426
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,910
There's no car.

427
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,622
You set me up
from the beginning, didn't you?

428
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,753
You son of a bitch,
fucking asshole of the worst kind.

429
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,786
- I think you're losing it.
- You fucking asshole.

430
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,298
Asshole.

431
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,459
Sofía.

432
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,743
Come here.

433
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,652
Come on.
Come on.

434
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,193
Are you gonna cry?

435
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,761
I'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

436
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,034
Thank you so much for coming.

437
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,339
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, the water's fine.

438
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,470
Thank you.

439
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,915
I'm very sorry, very sorry
about your car and the insurance,

440
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,111
but I want...
no, I want you to know

441
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,144
- that I'll find a way to get it fixed.
- We'll deal with that later.

442
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,555
However, I would like
to ask you a couple of questions.

443
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,252
Is that okay?

444
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,454
Sure.

445
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,861
Your general health,
is it good?

446
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,063
Yes.

447
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,860
Good.

448
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,393
How old are you?

449
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,401
23.

450
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,942
Have you ever been pregnant?

451
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,304
Do you have children?

452
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,179
No.

453
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,210
Are you partial to kangaroos
or other marsupials?

454
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,117
Kangaroos...

455
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,754
I don't understand.

456
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,733
We need a girl
with a fresh, young,

457
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:15,205
Betty-Crocker-
oven-bake-type oven.

458
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,071
- Helen.
- What?

459
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,541
You're both
making me nervous here.

460
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,067
Look, I'm sorry, she's been
under enormous strain recently.

461
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,545
Well, we both have, actually.

462
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,981
We recently
had a fourth miscarriage.

463
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,349
Where's the waiter?
I need another drink.

464
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,153
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,587
Well, the thing is...

466
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,657
- I guess what I'm trying to say...
- Why don't you just tell her already?

467
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,838
I am...
we are prepared

468
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,205
to offer you $50,000

469
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,301
to carry our baby.

470
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:00,582
His power sperm
and my delicados huevos.

471
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,853
A surrogate.

472
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,450
A surrogate mother.

473
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,723
What are you thinking?
What are your thoughts?

474
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,736
Hello, Sofía.

475
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,267
Hello.

476
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,779
Everything has gone smoothly.

477
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,579
Helen's egg has been fertilized
with Frank's power sperm,

478
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,175
as they call it,

479
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,551
and now we're ready
to place the embryo into your uterus.

480
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,613
Is it going to be painful?

481
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:42,023
The procedure itself
won't be painful.

482
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,927
However, there will be
some significant cramping

483
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,761
for a little while afterwards.
That's perfectly normal.

484
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,525
Okay.

485
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,435
Just try and relax.
I'll be back in a second.

486
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,775
All right, just do your best to relax.

487
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,335
Doing great.

488
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,705
This is gonna be cold

489
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,513
and it might pinch
a little bit, okay?

490
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,417
But it won't hurt.

491
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,117
There it is.
That's it.

492
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,891
That's it.
Doing terrific.

493
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,229
All right, honey.

494
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,686
Hi.

495
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,722
I'm locked out
and I have to go.

496
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,697
Your parents are not home?

497
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,227
Can I use your bathroom?
I have to go bad.

498
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,334
Go.

499
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,208
There.

500
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,886
You got your stuff back.

501
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,585
Mm-hmm.

502
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,423
Just different stuff.

503
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,166
Is it good?

504
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,039
You like kids?

505
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,136
Depends on the kid.

506
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,115
I suppose if it's cute
and charming.

507
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,846
Are we talking about you?

508
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,876
No, just kids.

509
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,955
What happened
to your face this time, Max?

510
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,358
Got into a fight with Charlie.

511
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,353
Same kid
that sneak-punched you?

512
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,366
Not sneak-punch,

513
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,992
sucker-punch.

514
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,967
You want that last cookie?

515
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,171
Yes, but you can have it.

516
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,110
Let's make a bet.
Whoever wins gets the cookie.

517
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,885
Okay, fair enough.

518
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,353
What's the bet?

519
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:29,690
Whoever can make the most ugliest,
disgusting face wins.

520
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,195
Okay, sounds like a great bet.

521
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,188
- Here we go.
- You go first.

522
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,701
Okay.

523
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,063
Your turn.

524
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,074
Are you ready?

525
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,669
No, no, no.
Let me prepare myself first.

526
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,737
Okay, I'm ready.

527
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,053
That's not an ugly face.

528
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,090
You win.

529
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,687
Thank you.

530
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,597
Okay.

531
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,226
Can I watch TV?

532
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,669
No. No, no, no.
I have to study.

533
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:17,697
You can play either as Isildur,

534
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:22,179
Aragorn, Gimli,

535
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,546
or Legolas.

536
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,643
And you get to fight

537
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,984
in like 10 places.

538
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,484
And one of them,
which is my favorite,

539
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:41,021
is the courtyard.

540
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,967
It's where,
at the end of the level,

541
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,937
at the end of the level,

542
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,805
you have to fight trolls.

543
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,571
And if the trolls fall down...

544
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,619
Hi, ugly.

545
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,149
That's not a very nice thing to say

546
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,355
to the man who practically
saved your life.

547
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,393
Who is this?

548
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,628
Who is this? How many superheroes
do you have in your life?

549
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,863
It's Neil.

550
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,367
Dr. Gardner.

551
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,773
The hey-get-the-fuck-off-me guy?

552
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,840
The emergency room doctor.

553
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,314
- How are you?
- I'm well. I'm well.

554
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,545
But you didn't follow
your doctor's orders, though.

555
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,212
You were supposed to call me,

556
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,744
let me know
how you were doing.

557
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,187
I'm fine, thank you.

558
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,691
- Good. Good.
- How did you get my number?

559
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,854
I got it off your chart.
You mad?

560
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,732
No.

561
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,826
Look, Sofía, I don't wanna
take a lot of your time.

562
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,598
I understand you're
a very busy woman,

563
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,265
so let me get
right down to it.

564
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,137
Will you meet me
for coffee tomorrow?

565
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,233
I'd love to, but I can't.

566
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,302
Is it my hideous looks?

567
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,573
No, I don't think you're ugly.

568
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,211
- So you think I'm cute?
- I didn't say that.

569
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,378
Well, which is it, Sofía? Do you think
I'm cute or do you think I'm ugly?

570
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,445
It's only fair to be honest
with me.

571
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,354
Just so you know,
I have a lie detector phone,

572
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,858
so anything you say,
I'll be able to tell

573
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,792
whether you're telling me
the truth or not.

574
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,488
- No you do not.
- I absolutely do.

575
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,996
I'm gonna turn it on right now.

576
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,659
Okay, it's on.
Did you hear that?

577
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,191
All right, I'm just gonna
do a little test run.

578
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,761
Is your name Sofía,
yes or no?

579
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,898
No.

580
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,374
Whoa, that was a lie.
And now we know how it works.

581
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,469
- Are you ready for your next question?
- Okay.

582
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,309
All right. Here we go.

583
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,412
Do you think I'm ugly?

584
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,509
No.

585
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,086
Do you think I'm cute?

586
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,114
No.

587
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,888
Are you sweating over there?

588
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,191
No.

589
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,422
Lie again, lie again.
Next question.

590
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,263
When you first
laid eyes on me,

591
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,269
even though you were
very rude,

592
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:02,204
did you secretly wanna make
monkey love with me?

593
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,801
- You are crazy.
- A simple yes or no.

594
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,538
No.

595
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,979
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll meet you. I'll meet you.

596
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,509
But only if you promise
to keep that detector thing at home.

597
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,222
I promise.

598
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,056
The coffee shop,
Westwood and Gayley, 4:00?

599
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,366
- Good night.
- Good night.

600
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,235
Max?

601
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,968
I think your parents
should be back home right now.

602
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,312
..the temperature dropping
from 59° this afternoon.

603
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,655
Hi, I'm Sofía, your neighbor.

604
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,594
I know. Wendy.

605
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,426
Did you get my note?

606
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,798
Yeah. Oh...

607
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,634
- Brad, get the kid.
- I'm busy.

608
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,730
Actually, he's sleeping
on the floor right now.

609
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,401
Fine, I'll get him.

610
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,473
Thanks a lot for watching him.

611
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,914
We've just been so busy.
Any trouble?

612
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,110
He had a scratch on his cheek.

613
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,313
Oh, well... fighting again.

614
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,549
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with that boy.

615
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,494
Max, honey.

616
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,724
Come on, come on.
Max, wake up.

617
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,664
Come on, time to go.

618
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,028
Sorry to put you out.

619
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,730
Good night, Max.

620
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,616
Get in your bed now.

621
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,995
- Excuse me... Wendy, you said?
- Yeah.

622
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,057
This might not be
any of my business,

623
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,068
but...

624
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,900
I find it a little peculiar
that a mother doesn't seem

625
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,703
to show concern that her son
is spending the night

626
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,368
at a stranger's apartment.

627
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,345
You're right.
It is none of your business.

628
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,074
But if you must know,

629
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,548
I'm not his mother,
I'm his foster mom.

630
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,279
Good night.

631
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,549
- Hello?
- Sofía, it's Frank.

632
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,824
- How's the car running, darling?
- Running terrific, thank you, Frank.

633
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,558
My pleasure.

634
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,398
You're not driving while you're
talking to me on the phone, are you?

635
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,233
Mm-mmm, no, I'm not driving.

636
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,637
Good, good.
But...

637
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,504
- anyhoo, how are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

638
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,442
And the visit to the doctor
went well?

639
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,344
Yes. Listen, I'm on my way to class.
I have a test.

640
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,677
Listen...

641
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:01,412
I think Helen would rather like
to come with you next time.

642
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,181
That's fine.

643
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,881
Oh, good girl.

644
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,015
Anyway, we'll chat soon,
all right?

645
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,524
- Okay, bye.
- Good.

646
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,288
Right.

647
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:33,071
So I had to put the microphone
right in front of everyone.

648
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,585
Ice cream. How delicious.
I want a chocolate one

649
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,985
in a little cone... and vanilla
and everything on it. Ask him.

650
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,887
What flavor do you have?

651
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,525
What is it?

652
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,419
What's going on?

653
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,400
Hey, watch out.

654
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,977
- That's gross.
- Sofía, you just puked.

655
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,986
And now you wanted
to eat ice cream?

656
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,988
And I know Jesse
didn't get you that furniture

657
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,684
and obviously
you cannot afford the car.

658
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,158
So are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

659
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,785
Where did you get the money?

660
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,923
Come here.

661
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,596
Do you remember Frank
and his wife, Helen?

662
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,038
The snooty Jaguar people?

663
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,138
They made me a proposal
that I couldn't refuse.

664
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,578
You had sex with a man
for a million dollars?

665
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,013
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

666
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,582
Why you?

667
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,457
I mean, besides the obvious
Latina child-bearing hips,

668
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,983
- why you?
- Monica, I don't know,

669
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,859
and I don't think
I wanna know.

670
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,126
Aren't you concerned
that Helen's a raving witch,

671
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,497
not to mention
a chain-smoking drunk?

672
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,163
I can't think about that
right now.

673
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,196
Sofía, women fall in love
with the babies inside of them,

674
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,209
- I know that.
- How would you know?

675
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,471
Hello?

676
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,207
Because of "Baby Mother,
a Teenage Pregnancy,"

677
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,442
starring Tori Spelling.

678
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,451
Remember, she got pregnant
from her math teacher, Alan Thicke,

679
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,217
and... well, the thing is,

680
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,417
even Tori eventually
fell in love with the baby.

681
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,482
Where's our food?

682
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,551
This is not like marrying Jesse
for a green card, Sofía.

683
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,859
You'll fall in love
with the baby, just like Tori.

684
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,592
This is a business transaction,
nothing more.

685
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,066
It's not even my egg.
It's Helen's and Frank's baby.

686
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,092
As soon as I get attached
to something, I fail.

687
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,833
I can't let that happen, period.

688
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,704
So how long have you
been having morning sickness?

689
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,008
- Two weeks.
- Any other symptoms?

690
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,709
- You horny?
- No.

691
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,580
You're horny.

692
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,711
Maybe a little.

693
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,618
Okay, okay, okay.

694
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,253
A lot. Very horny.
Monica, horny all the time.

695
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,957
Horny before morning sickness,
horny after morning sickness,

696
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,091
and horny between.
Horny, horny, horny, horny.

697
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,796
I've never seen you horny before.

698
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,771
I'm supposed to meet
that doctor from the ER.

699
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,798
- I'm thinking of canceling.
- Why?

700
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,935
He'll say a compliment,
like "Hello, how are you?",

701
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,140
and I'm afraid I'll start
humping his leg like a dog.

702
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,553
- Hi.
- Hey.

703
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,849
Hi, you look beautiful.

704
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,449
This is my table.
You have to sit at that table.

705
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,517
Wha... what?

706
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,585
I don't understand.

707
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:35,064
You made the rules. Doctor, you said
we'll sit at different tables, so...

708
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,398
Go. That's your table.
Yeah.

709
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:41,768
- So I did, so I did.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,796
Okay.

711
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,643
This is great.

712
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,745
How was your day?
Your hair looks nice.

713
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:01,349
How's your rash?
Is your rash...

714
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,589
Is that a...
What? Huh?

715
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,822
Come on.

716
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

717
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,166
You want coffee?

718
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,942
What?

719
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,139
You know what I really want?

720
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,670
What?

721
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,912
I just want to relax,

722
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,317
sit on a sofa and eat

723
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,345
lots and lots of pepperoni pizza.

724
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,691
I love relaxing,
I have a sofa and coincidently,

725
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,061
I just quit being a vegetarian
about 30 seconds ago,

726
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,965
so pepperoni pizza sounds perfect.

727
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,940
No sex, no seduction of any kind
once we get into your apartment, okay?

728
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,210
Okay?

729
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,740
- Okay.
- Good.

730
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,310
- Good.
- I'm glad we're on the same page.

731
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,789
Yeah, me too.

732
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,724
Perfect.

733
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,784
Good.

734
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,092
Very good.

735
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,195
- Neil...
- What? What, what, what?

736
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,704
On your knees.
I want you to kneel.

737
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:22,762
Oh, kneel. Right.

738
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,865
Wait, wait, wait.

739
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,432
Something...
the elevator stop.

740
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,081
Stop.

741
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,688
Well, we'll be fine
until we run out of oxygen.

742
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,892
You know, in hindsight,
I probably shouldn't have kicked it.

743
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,162
Nice underwear.

744
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,567
Hey, they have sentimental value.

745
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,129
- Your father's?
- And his father's father.

746
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,200
And my great-great-grandmother,
she was a big lady.

747
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,838
Yeah, these Fruit of the Looms
go back many generations.

748
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,745
Are we stuck?

749
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,147
Yeah, one could say that.

750
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,482
It's hot in here.
You want some pizza?

751
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,214
Yes, please.

752
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,018
¿Cómo se dice "pizza"?

753
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,080
Pizza.

754
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,989
- Oh, pizza, pizza. Okay.
- Pizza.

755
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:21,820
I was raised by my grandmother.
After she passed away a year ago,

756
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,560
I came to this country.

757
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,727
I'm sorry about your grandmother.

758
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,665
She was very old.

759
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,074
I think it's only a tragedy
when people die young

760
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,671
or when they die unhappy,
you know?

761
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,376
You have family?

762
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,288
Yeah.
I have my mom.

763
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,823
Are you mama's boy?

764
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,468
You know,

765
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,268
I have some patients
in this building.

766
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,609
If they could see you now,
Dr. Gardner, look at you.

767
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,738
Yeah. That's why I think
we'd better get dressed.

768
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,009
Okay.

769
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,209
Mrs. Goldfarb.

770
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,778
How's the hip?

771
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,452
Hello?

772
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,852
Yes, this is Sofía.

773
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,266
Hello. I have an appointment
with your principal.

774
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,776
- Okay, would you mind taking a seat?
- Yeah, thanks.

775
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,441
You must be Sofía.
I'm Mr. Jones, Max's principal.

776
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,541
Nice to meet you.

777
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,711
I don't understand
why I've been called.

778
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:26,382
The Petersons left you
as an emergency number.

779
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,391
Young Max over here...

780
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,485
hit two children today.

781
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,190
He has a history
of hitting Charlie Monroe.

782
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,630
Charlie? No.

783
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:38,532
That's because Charlie has a history
of sneak-punching Max.

784
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,229
Sucker-punching.

785
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,728
I can assure you that Charlie
never sucker-punched Max.

786
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,002
Yes?

787
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,442
Yes, Charlie,
please sit out in the hall.

788
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,043
You didn't tell me she was a girl.

789
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,643
You hit a girl? Max, listen to me.

790
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,380
Never hit a girl.

791
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,754
Charlie has been provoking
young Max by kissing him.

792
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,090
Now the other boy,
Kenneth lacavelli...

793
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:08,621
Kenneth says that Max
punched him in the nose for no reason.

794
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,365
Why did you hit him?
Max, listen to me. I'm late.

795
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,065
Just tell Mr. Jones
so I can get to my class, okay?

796
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,267
You're not gonna wanna hear it.

797
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,674
- Just tell us.
- Fine.

798
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,544
Kenny offered me five bucks
to go through your panty drawer,

799
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,812
so I punched the dumb idiot.

800
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,746
Max, come with me.

801
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,225
Wait outside for a little while, okay?

802
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,325
Go sit down on the chair,
and don't sit next to Charlie.

803
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,596
And sit quietly.

804
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,633
I find myself
in an awkward position.

805
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,201
Max's foster parents are almost
impossible to get in touch with.

806
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,076
Max seems to get
a lot of bruises on his face.

807
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,948
- If it's not the kids...
- Max.

808
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,354
Unless the child makes accusations,
it's very difficult to intervene.

809
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,757
However, Max has been
picked up by police

810
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,261
in his mother's old neighborhood.

811
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,230
She's a horrible mom. Alcoholic,
gave the child vicious beatings.

812
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,859
And each time he seeks her out,

813
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,664
he ends up with more bruises.
Max.

814
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,303
I'm very disappointed in you, Max.

815
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,002
First, you break into my apartment.
Then you hit a girl.

816
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:30,308
You're not mad at me
about hitting Kenny?

817
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,111
No. That one I can forgive.

818
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,209
He's a pervert,
and he should be stopped.

819
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:38,346
But I don't want you
hitting Charlie.

820
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,016
If she tries to kiss you,
kiss her back.

821
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,149
No way.

822
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,621
Women don't like men
that give in too easily.

823
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,129
Trust me.

824
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,189
She kisses you because
she loves a challenge.

825
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,166
Why?

826
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,793
Because...

827
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:57,000
Because women are locas,
that's why.

828
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,508
I thought she kisses me
because I'm cute.

829
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:05,772
About you
breaking into my place...

830
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:10,514
I'm gonna put a key in a very,
very secret hiding place

831
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,818
so you will never find it.

832
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,087
So, even if you're bored
and hungry

833
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,027
and have a strong desire
to steal my doughnuts,

834
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,862
don't bother looking for the key...

835
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:27,068
which will be hidden
under the ashtray outside my door.

836
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,267
I haven't felt the baby kick at all.

837
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:37,610
First-time mothers sometimes
don't recognize the kicking sensation.

838
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,844
They don't even feel the first kick
until the eighth month.

839
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,284
Okay, here's the heart.

840
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,083
Sorry, Doctor, but...

841
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,089
I don't know, it's beating very fast.

842
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,421
- It's normal?
- Yes, that's perfectly normal.

843
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,394
Okay, now, you're sure
you want to know the sex?

844
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,056
Oh, yes, absolutely.

845
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,725
Do you want we should wait
for Mrs. Bauman?

846
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,428
No, she's unable to be here,

847
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,437
she's not feeling too good.

848
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,903
You are going to have...

849
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,131
a boy.

850
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,040
Congratulations.

851
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:29,665
Sofía, I don't get this stupid math.

852
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,963
I'm studying now, Max.

853
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,335
Fine, then can I play
video games?

854
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:40,833
I see three bucks
and five bucks and one buck.

855
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,708
How many bucks in all?

856
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,040
You know this one,
three and five.

857
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,177
Three and five is seven, right?

858
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,518
- No.
- Oh, yeah. Eight?

859
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,614
And one?

860
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,591
I bet that's your boyfriend.

861
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,762
Oh, it's you.

862
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,274
How rude.
Come here you.

863
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,998
Frank Bauman, please?
It's Sofía.

864
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,500
Hello, Sofía.

865
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,837
She never showed, Frank.

866
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,741
Yes, I know...

867
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,404
It's the second straight time.

868
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,607
Look, Sofía, just see the doctor.

869
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,172
Everything will be fine.

870
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,894
- You're falling in love with the baby.
- No.

871
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,234
- No.
- Yes, you are.

872
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,738
- No. No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

873
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,240
I'm handling
this professionally.

874
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,868
I'm just concerned
about its safety, that's all.

875
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,071
What are you gonna do?

876
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,308
There's nothing I can do.

877
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,975
- Have you told Neil?
- No.

878
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,847
- Are you going to?
- No.

879
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,477
What's wrong with you?
You're gonna show.

880
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,851
I'll wear big clothes.

881
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,516
What, a tent? He's a doctor,
I think he's gonna know.

882
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,024
I'll put off sex
when I start to show.

883
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,122
I can't tell him. I can't.

884
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,427
It will be too much for him
to understand right now.

885
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,933
But I'm moving,
I'm past you... now.

886
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,936
No, no, we're not racing.

887
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,062
- What?
- We're fighting.

888
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,131
Oh, oh. Then I'm not past you.
I'm just getting... beat up.

889
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,853
Can you hear that?

890
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,280
Can I talk to you for a second?

891
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,552
- I need to say something.
- Let's go outside. Okay.

892
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,049
A minus.

893
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,084
- Hey, that's great.
- No, it's not great.

894
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,963
I had a 4.0 before you two men
came into my life.

895
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,159
Okay, and your point being?

896
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,463
Instead of four times a week,

897
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,970
how about we see each other
two times a week?

898
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:58,098
Oh. Five times a week.

899
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,733
Neil, seriously.
You're going up.

900
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,176
I know, this is how it's done
in America. We negotiate.

901
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,839
Two times a week.

902
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,609
- Three and a half.
- Two and a half.

903
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:11,114
Done, okay? Sleeping in on Sundays
does not count as a half.

904
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,054
Okay.

905
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:16,024
Oh, this is gonna
sound crazy, but, uh,

906
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,424
I need to do something
for my mother,

907
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,087
- and I need you to help.
- What is it?

908
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,130
Well, she's losing her memory,
so all she knows is what I tell her,

909
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,997
and I can pretty much
tell her anything.

910
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,467
What do you want me to do?

911
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,596
Well, she's always had
these dreams

912
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,937
of me getting married,
having a family.

913
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,138
You want me to be your wife?

914
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,404
Just for a day.

915
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,916
Just for a day?

916
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,714
Okay. I can do that, yeah.

917
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,551
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

918
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,022
Great.

919
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,584
- Hello.
- Hey.

920
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,081
Hey, Dad.

921
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,823
You said your mother dreamt of you
being married with a family? Okay.

922
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,056
Here's our family.

923
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,868
Mom. What's up?
It's me, Neil.

924
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,631
Hello.

925
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,832
You remember? Sofía, my wife.

926
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,535
Wife? Oh, yes, of course.

927
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,737
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

928
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,712
- How are you?
- Fine.

929
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,348
And... and you remember Max,
your grandson?

930
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,649
Max...

931
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,323
Oh, she's beautiful.

932
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:34,190
- When is the baby due?
- Oh Mom, Sofía's...

933
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,859
- April 23rd.
.. not pregnant.

934
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,528
I can hardly wait.

935
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:49,809
- Sorry about that.
- About what?

936
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:52,542
You know, my mom thinking
you were pregnant. She's just...

937
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:56,279
- I've put on some weight.
- No, not at all. You look great.

938
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,316
And thank you, Max.

939
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,583
Can we come back again?

940
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,990
We'll see.

941
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,085
We'll see.

942
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,904
He's out like a light.

943
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,067
When I was a little girl
in Colombia,

944
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,044
my grandmother
used to pat my forehead

945
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,070
until I fell asleep.

946
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,208
Worked every time,
like hypnosis.

947
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,879
When I thought I was gonna
pursue psychiatry,

948
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,048
I took a course in hypnosis.

949
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,115
I was such a dog.

950
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,218
- Why's that?
- Well, I liked this girl in college,

951
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,058
so I hypnotized her,

952
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:43,554
and I told her that every time
anyone said the word "anyway,"

953
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,625
she'd think of me and have
an intense orgasm.

954
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,193
Did it work?

955
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:51,502
Yeah. It kind of backfired
on me, though,

956
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,907
because she wound up
dating a guy

957
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,433
who said "anyway" a lot.

958
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,511
This person I know, Frank,

959
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,318
says "anyhoo" all the time,
it's funny.

960
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,789
"Anyhoo... "

961
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,224
- No, no, no.
- I'm very suggestible.

962
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,954
- I know, but it'll be fun.
- No, seriously.

963
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,689
No, you're gonna like this.
It'll be fun.

964
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,891
- You ready? Okay.
- Okay.

965
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,767
Okay, you ready?
No, I'm serious.

966
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,499
No crossing of the eyes.

967
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,666
Look at my eyes.

968
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,198
Okay.

969
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,112
Any time Frank says
the word "anyhoo,"

970
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:39,887
you will think of me
and have an intense orgasm.

971
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,150
What?

972
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,817
Okay.

973
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,759
- Okay.
- Okay?

974
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,318
- Okay.
- Look at me.

975
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,496
Anyhoo...

976
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,406
Ah, it's working.

977
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,540
I hate to bring him back here.

978
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,842
It's not right.

979
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,217
He had a long day.

980
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,518
Thanks.

981
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,621
- It's not right.
- I know.

982
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,856
What can I do?

983
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:22,592
Well, you could do
a lot of things.

984
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,156
- You can call Social Services.
- No.

985
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,667
If I call Social Services,

986
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,033
they'll take him away.
He might go somewhere worse.

987
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:34,709
- Hey.
- For the love of God,

988
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,770
- what are you doing here?
- Is that any way to greet your husband?

989
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,839
- Who's this?
- I'm Neil. Did you say husband?

990
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,679
- Nobody...
- Oh, Sofía,

991
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:45,551
I've met someone else and I need you
to sign these divorce papers.

992
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,021
You're married?

993
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,388
- Holy shit, who knocked you up?
- She's not pregnant.

994
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,723
- Wait a second.
- Shit. Are you the daddy, Champ?

995
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,489
It's true.

996
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,897
What?

997
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,494
I didn't want
to tell you this way.

998
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,629
Wait. Wait, you really are pregnant?

999
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,572
- My kid?
- No.

1000
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,543
- This gets better and better.
- Shut up.

1001
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,272
I'm a surrogate.

1002
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,837
Whoa, I don't remember seeing that
on your goals charts.

1003
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,610
- Get out.
- I am not leaving this show.

1004
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,514
Okay, wait a second.
Hold on, you're her husband?

1005
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,078
And you're a surrogate?

1006
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,748
- No, no, leave it open.
- No, no, no.

1007
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,553
- Neil, please, please.
- It's fine. It's fine.

1008
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,583
- Sofía, really. Come on.
- No, no.

1009
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,390
Wait, Neil, please.

1010
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,527
I'm getting remarried

1011
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,364
and I need you
to sign these papers.

1012
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,302
Now look, if you sign them now,

1013
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,670
you'll probably have enough time
to kick the little one out

1014
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,140
before INS finds you
and deports you.

1015
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,699
If you don't sign them,

1016
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,007
I'm gonna have to make
an anonymous call to the INS,

1017
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,740
and they're probably gonna
boot your ass

1018
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,748
back to Colombia
by tomorrow afternoon.

1019
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,410
If you sign these now,
I'll be out of your life forever.

1020
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,761
They want me to stay with them
for the last trimester.

1021
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,195
You're going to?

1022
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,290
No. I told him no.

1023
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,891
Helen doesn't care.

1024
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,838
- I think I want to keep...
- Keep what?

1025
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,636
Oh my God, Sofía.
Keep the baby?

1026
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,182
I don't think I can
give him up to her.

1027
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,981
Sofía, it's their baby, okay?

1028
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,421
There are legal issues
you are not gonna be able to handle.

1029
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,549
- Then I'll go back to Colombia.
- What about school?

1030
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,117
Your plans, the chart,
everything?

1031
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,592
When my divorce goes through,
I'll lose my green card.

1032
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,428
What choice do I have?
What choice do I have?

1033
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,696
- What if you're wrong about Helen?
- I'm not.

1034
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,295
How many times
have you met her?

1035
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,506
Twice.

1036
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,066
Twice?

1037
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,442
Oh, come on.
Live with them.

1038
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:54,448
Hey, come back here,
you little varmint.

1039
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,884
Max, could you turn off the TV
for a second?

1040
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,686
I wanna talk to you.

1041
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,196
I wanna ask you a question.

1042
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,201
And I want you
to answer me honestly, okay?

1043
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,600
Okay.

1044
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,231
Do your foster parents
ever hit you?

1045
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,706
No.

1046
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,436
Then who?

1047
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,104
I know it's not Charlie
who gave you those bruises.

1048
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,942
I fall a lot.

1049
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,614
You haven't fallen
in a while, I see.

1050
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,553
Since I started
hanging out with you,

1051
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,250
I'm less klutzy, I guess.

1052
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,323
Come here.

1053
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,996
I really am pregnant.

1054
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,402
- Neil's mother was right.
- You are?

1055
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,839
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,070
And I have to go live
with certain people

1057
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,908
until the baby's born, okay?

1058
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,707
Can I come with you?

1059
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:09,082
No, but I'll come and visit you.

1060
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,888
I promise.

1061
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,754
How come nobody likes me?

1062
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:17,231
No. Look at me.

1063
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,325
Are you crazy?

1064
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,231
Then how come
you're leaving me here?

1065
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,765
Look at me.
I'm sorry.

1066
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,870
I'll come and visit you
first chance I get.

1067
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,279
Max.

1068
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:38,783
Sweetie, look at me.
Look at me.

1069
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,812
I need you to be strong.

1070
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,256
Just because Wendy and Brad
are jerks,

1071
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,055
that doesn't mean
you're not a terrific kid.

1072
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,891
Because you are, okay?

1073
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,658
You need to be strong.

1074
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,097
You need to be the strongest kid
on the face of the earth.

1075
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,601
Tell me you'll do that.

1076
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,798
Tell me you'll do that.
Tell me.

1077
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,238
Max.

1078
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:12,386
Oh, I feel so sorry for you
having to live here in this shithole.

1079
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,180
Look at that.

1080
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,215
Hello, hello, hello.

1081
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,851
My darling Sofía.

1082
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,919
- Hi.
- How are you?

1083
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,021
I'm fine. How are you?

1084
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,156
- You remember Monica.
- Hi.

1085
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,632
Of course, yes.

1086
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,964
Lovely top.

1087
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,593
- Sleeves, but no sleeves.
- I designed it.

1088
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:31,072
Anyway, we're gonna have
a big formal dinner tonight

1089
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,871
to celebrate your arrival.
Please ask anybody you like.

1090
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,171
- Okay, thank you.
- All right?

1091
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,769
Frank, I have a big bag.

1092
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,144
Of course. Let me.
I'll get the bags, you go in.

1093
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,046
Wait until Helen
finds out your here.

1094
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,573
She's gonna do cartwheels.

1095
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,051
Off you go.

1096
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:47,852
Tell her not to go
to crazy with those cartwheels,

1097
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,120
she might pull a hammy
or something.

1098
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,060
I'd like to make a toast,
if I may.

1099
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,866
My wife and I have had
a tough couple of years,

1100
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,130
and well, we're all family here

1101
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,069
so most of you
are aware of our troubles.

1102
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,640
And I'd like to say that I...

1103
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:11,112
I love my wife very dearly

1104
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,377
and I think that I speak
for both of us:

1105
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,213
Thank you for making

1106
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:20,245
my love Helen's and my dream
finally come true.

1107
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,215
To Sofía and the baby.

1108
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,785
To Sofía and the baby.

1109
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,428
Uncle Frank, when's dinner?

1110
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,799
She's not smoking.

1111
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,697
She's not drinking.

1112
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,835
And I haven't seen her smoke
all night, even when we were outside.

1113
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,744
Back in World War II,

1114
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:49,114
our ship was hit
by two Jap torpedoes.

1115
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:52,279
We lost the vessel,
sank in 10 minutes.

1116
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,221
My mates and I were set adrift.

1117
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,622
Some died within days.

1118
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,627
Others wanted to die.

1119
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:03,562
I had to breathe into a corpse
for a floatation device.

1120
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,094
By the fifth day at sea,

1121
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,001
we were so hungry and thirsty

1122
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,199
we decided to drink
our own urine.

1123
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,208
- What's your name?
- Chaney.

1124
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,903
Janie?

1125
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,435
No, it's Chaney, it's with a "C-H."

1126
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,743
Like Dick?

1127
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:23,343
That's funny, 'cause I'm George,

1128
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,444
like Bush.

1129
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,614
I'd actually like to make
another toast

1130
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,954
to dear old George here.

1131
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,654
To his unwittingly

1132
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,858
bringing Sofía into our lives

1133
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,027
by hurling her car
at 35 miles an hour

1134
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,663
down the side of the road
and slamming it into ours,

1135
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,798
nearly killing my dear wife
and myself.

1136
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,307
Thank you, George,

1137
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:50,870
for your brilliantly obtuse
act of misunderstanding.

1138
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,780
I mean that
in the nicest possible way.

1139
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,443
To George.

1140
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,577
To George.

1141
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,485
To me.

1142
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,783
How did you and Helen meet?

1143
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,091
Good question.

1144
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:06,890
Actually, you were working
as a waitress in a cocktail bar

1145
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,157
when I met you.

1146
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,757
- Frank, we are not going to do that.
- Here we go.

1147
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,768
It's the occasion.

1148
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,167
They do this every year.

1149
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,001
We do this every year
at our anniversary.

1150
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,462
It's true.

1151
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,832
I could get used to this place.

1152
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,536
I know.

1153
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:26,302
Do you think Frank ever
looks at you with desire?

1154
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,776
Ay, Monica María.

1155
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,905
That guy is like...
could be my father.

1156
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:34,507
Oh, oh, Frank.

1157
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,812
- Oh, don't stop.
- Shut up, Monica.

1158
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,649
- Monica, stop.
- Oh, take that, you naughty girl.

1159
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,416
Shut up.

1160
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,653
I never feel him kick.

1161
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,523
Hello.

1162
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,588
Frank, what are you doing here?

1163
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,293
Just wanted to say...

1164
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,393
a personal thank you.

1165
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,669
Okay. You're welcome.

1166
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:16,274
Yes, yes. Right.

1167
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,286
Good night.

1168
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,189
Good night.

1169
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:28,225
Sofía, darling Sofía,

1170
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,697
you've no idea
how long it's been,

1171
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,427
this clinical fertility business.

1172
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,800
The closest I've come
to any affection in the last two years

1173
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:36,862
is a weekly trip
to the special room,

1174
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,203
where I have to wank
into a small vial

1175
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,505
using nothing but pornos
starring people with names

1176
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:44,774
like "Jizzy McGuire"
and "Seymore Hooters. "

1177
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,246
Oh, darling,

1178
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:48,749
- I'm just a sweet English schoolboy...
- Frank.

1179
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,251
- Frank.
- Please.

1180
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,820
Oh my God.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1181
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,518
Oh, Christ.

1182
01:14:57,526 --> 01:15:01,394
Please, forgive me.
I've no idea what came...

1183
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,524
Anyhoo, I will just be leaving.

1184
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,499
Are you all right, darling?

1185
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,096
- Please leave.
- Anyhoo, I just...

1186
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,004
Anyhoo, I just...

1187
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,442
Anyhoo, I just...

1188
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,576
Anyhoo?

1189
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,852
Anyhoo.

1190
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,754
Anyhoo. Anyhoo.

1191
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,123
Anyhoo.

1192
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,593
Anyhoo...

1193
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,839
Good morning.

1194
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,779
Good morning.

1195
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,144
Sleep well?

1196
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,778
Yeah, okay.

1197
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,653
You hungry?

1198
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,784
It's Sunday. Rosa sleeps in,

1199
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,225
but I can scramble you some eggs.

1200
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,126
That's about the only thing
I can make.

1201
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,755
Scrambled eggs sounds fine.

1202
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,295
- How many?
- How many are you having?

1203
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,637
One.

1204
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,700
Okay, I'll have the same.

1205
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,213
Two.

1206
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,240
Okay, three.

1207
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,184
Thank you.

1208
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,822
I noticed you're not smoking.

1209
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,864
No, I stopped the week
before you got here.

1210
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,336
I'm on the patch.

1211
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,463
It works?

1212
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,906
Well, I'm not smoking.

1213
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,114
You have a beautiful house.

1214
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,426
Thank you.

1215
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,405
Would you like
some orange juice?

1216
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,407
Okay, thank you.

1217
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,170
No, sit, I'll...
I'll get it.

1218
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,415
Thank you.

1219
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:49,621
Do you want
to sit down with me?

1220
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,426
No. I'm in kind of a rush.

1221
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,811
You can drop your plate
in the sink,

1222
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,281
and Rosa will take care of it for you.

1223
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,923
Morning, Sofía.

1224
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,654
- Good morning.
- Rosa make that for you?

1225
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,461
- Today's Sunday.
- Oh, yeah, blast it.

1226
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,056
She sleeps in.

1227
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,160
I'll have to get together my own
bloody concoction, I suppose.

1228
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,398
You made that yourself,
did you?

1229
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,236
Helen.

1230
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,806
Helen made that for you?

1231
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,440
Yes.

1232
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,472
My wife, Helen?
Helen Bauman?

1233
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,575
Yes. Yes.

1234
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,753
Did you have
pleasant dreams last night?

1235
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,560
What, is there...

1236
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,464
I've got sleep in my eyes.

1237
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:01,458
No.

1238
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,934
The old morning hair.

1239
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,884
I hate her.

1240
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,720
I get sick when I think my baby
could be in her hands.

1241
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,589
Yeah, but...
pass me the water?

1242
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,721
Is she nice? Ever?

1243
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,425
Never. Never.

1244
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,833
She's almost nice.

1245
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,666
Then she stops herself.

1246
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,035
I don't know.

1247
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,307
Okay, but...

1248
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,207
at least she wants to be nice.

1249
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,940
That means there's still
hope for her.

1250
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,381
- No.
- Where's my pretty cousin off to today?

1251
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,310
I'm gonna stop in on Max.
I haven't heard from him.

1252
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:53,946
Thanks for lunch.

1253
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,684
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

1254
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,163
Emergency.

1255
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,531
Yes, hi.
I'm looking for Dr. Gardner.

1256
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,559
Dr. Gardner's out today.

1257
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,166
Okay. Can you tell him
that Sofía called?

1258
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,437
Sofía. And your last name?

1259
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:50,467
Excuse me,
is that Sofía for Neil?

1260
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,809
Yes.

1261
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,613
- Sofía, hi. It's Paul, Neil's friend.
- Yes?

1262
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,883
Listen, I'm afraid I have
some sad news about Neil's mother.

1263
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,566
Neil. Neil.

1264
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:15,797
Hey.

1265
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:18,563
What are you doing here?

1266
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,967
Paul told me you'd be here.

1267
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,539
I'm sorry.

1268
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,513
How's everything?

1269
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,322
Fine.

1270
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,151
You're glowing.

1271
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,424
I know.

1272
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,311
What?

1273
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,836
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything.

1274
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,509
I'm sorry about everything.

1275
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,851
You take care, Sofía.

1276
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,552
Okay?

1277
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,302
Perfect timing.

1278
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,705
I've got a surprise for you.
The workers have just finished.

1279
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:36,150
Helen designed it, you know.

1280
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:37,981
She did?

1281
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:45,216
This was mine when I was...

1282
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,626
Let me see.

1283
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,434
Rupert.

1284
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,706
Why did you choose me?

1285
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:10,549
Well, you were
in a desperate situation,

1286
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,712
like the other girls
we were considering,

1287
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:15,018
but we didn't know
who they were.

1288
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:16,819
You didn't know me either.

1289
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,751
Sofía...

1290
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,763
we knew who you were
the moment you pulled over.

1291
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:36,372
Yes, my name is Jim Pierce.
I'm with the INS.

1292
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,743
I'm looking for a Sofía García,

1293
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,010
formerly Sofía Thompson.

1294
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,210
I'm told she resides here.
Is she in?

1295
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,048
Why?

1296
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,146
We've had a rash
of illegal marriages.

1297
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:51,317
We recently arrested
her ex-husband, Jesse Thompson,

1298
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,520
who was about to enter
into another illegal marriage.

1299
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:57,292
He claims he married Sofía so she could
primarily get her green card.

1300
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,799
That's a federal offense.

1301
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:17,641
Hi, Helen.

1302
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,488
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

1303
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:23,320
No, no, no.

1304
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,765
I know you don't think
I'm the nicest person in the world...

1305
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,870
and you probably don't think
I'd make a great mother.

1306
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,283
The first three times
we got pregnant,

1307
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:53,913
we lost our baby

1308
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:56,355
within the first three months.

1309
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,953
But the last time we got pregnant,

1310
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:03,361
we reached
six and a half months.

1311
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,696
And so that baby died.

1312
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,637
And...

1313
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:15,302
I sort of died, too.

1314
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,941
I haven't thanked you

1315
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:26,215
for giving me my life back.

1316
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:31,358
So thank you, Sofía.

1317
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:44,469
Oh, I wonder if you'd mind
working for my brother.

1318
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,872
He's a lawyer.
He needs a good paralegal.

1319
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,638
It'll give you a chance
to stay in school, get your visa,

1320
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:52,373
and spend some time
with the baby.

1321
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,558
Oh my God.

1322
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:15,330
He kicked.

1323
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:45,224
- Hi.
- Sofía.

1324
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:46,563
Max?

1325
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,799
Oh, you didn't hear?

1326
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:51,464
Hear what?

1327
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:54,566
10 days ago, he ran away
to his real mother's again.

1328
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,577
She put him
in the hospital this time.

1329
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:58,408
- How is he?
- Just some bruises.

1330
01:26:58,446 --> 01:26:59,504
Where is he?

1331
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,913
Social Services took him
from us three days ago.

1332
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:04,282
- No, no, no. Where is he now?
- I don't know.

1333
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:31,611
Come on, come on.

1334
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:33,136
It's crowning.

1335
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:34,648
Keep pushing.

1336
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,451
- Push.
- Push.

1337
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,283
Sofía, this is it.

1338
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:41,618
Push.

1339
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,022
Very good.
Doing great, good job.

1340
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,794
Push, push, push.

1341
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,092
Push.

1342
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:51,928
That's it.

1343
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,433
Here it comes.

1344
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,766
Is he okay?

1345
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,662
There you are.

1346
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

1347
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,046
How are you holding up?

1348
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:17,344
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1349
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,580
Well, not fine.

1350
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,918
But I will be.

1351
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,424
And you?

1352
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,255
I'm okay.

1353
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:28,785
Good.

1354
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:40,236
Well, I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

1355
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:42,469
Dr. Gardner.

1356
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,878
Yes, Miss García?

1357
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,644
I was thinking of going
to the cafeteria

1358
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:52,448
to get some coffee.
Would you like to join me?

1359
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,955
Do we have to sit
at separate tables?

1360
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:57,921
Just wave to me
so I know you care.

1361
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,456
Well, the cafeteria's closed.

1362
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:04,926
I should get going.

1363
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,765
- Take care.
- Okay.

1364
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,795
Excuse me, miss?
I think this call's for you.

1365
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,625
Hello?

1366
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:45,571
I just have one question,
and I should warn you,

1367
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,131
I'm on the lie detector phone,
and it's ready to go.

1368
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,539
I need to know...

1369
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,742
are you just a little bit
in love with me?

1370
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,091
No.

1371
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:16,697
Let's go, kiddo.

1372
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:20,364
There you go.
Come on.

1373
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,603
You're gonna like this couple.
They just got married

1374
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:25,544
and they've got this great yard
that you can play in.

1375
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,777
Come on, Max.
This is gonna be fun.

1376
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:45,089
Oh, it's you.

1377
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:50,103
Open the door.

1378
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:52,071
Hello.

1379
01:31:55,137 --> 01:32:02,071
