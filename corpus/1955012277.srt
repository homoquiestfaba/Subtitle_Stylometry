00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,696
33

2
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,549
Great party, Mario.

3
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,269
Lobos! Pass me the ball!

4
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,646
Very good! Scarlet, Scarlet!

5
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,398
Here, on the left! Go!

6
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,483
Lobos, here!

7
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,567
Here here!

8
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,071
Well done, Scarlet!

9
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,116
That's my baby, that's my baby.

10
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,708
Mario!

11
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,212
I love your bottom, Katy.

12
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:36,216
I already told you? You have the best bottom in Copiapo.

13
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,717
You are crazy!

14
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,427
- Hey Mario. - Hey Manuel.

15
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,435
A dance, Copiapo!

16
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,982
Lucho ...

17
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,654
Tomorrow is my free day, but ...

18
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,115
I would like to work.

19
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,575
I'm kind of... short of money.

20
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,618
Tomorrow?

21
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,579
Yeah... I, I know thre is a lot of people asking you for the same thing, but ...

22
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,666
You got it.

23
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,711
That's it? You're not gonna fight me?

24
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,504
I`m not gonna fight you.

25
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,177
Thank you very much Copiapo!

26
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,304
Hello, Jessi.

27
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,514
Hello, Don Jose.

28
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,601
Alex, I found a job for you.

29
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,312
Rodrigo is gonna be looking for some help in the body shop.

30
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,981
We talked about this last time.

31
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,524
What's gonna be, Dad?

32
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,443
¿50 a week?

33
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,319
You love birds get the sonogram yet?

34
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,863
- Is boy. - It's a girl.

35
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,365
- Is boy. - It's a girl.

36
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,951
- Is boy. - It's a girl.

37
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,619
Is a boy. Is a boy.

38
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,371
Alex, talk to him. - Ok

39
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,209
Rodrigo. How are you man?

40
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,837
- Did you talk to your man? - Yes.

41
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,714
- How much are you're gonna pay? - 50 a week.

42
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,175
- 50 a week. - You're having a baby.

43
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,843
Get your ass out of that mine.

44
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,225
Someone fills this old man's glass.

45
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,186
Mario Gomez!

46
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,355
Congratulations on your retirement.

47
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,607
45 years of mining.

48
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,208
The bravest man I ever met.

49
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:17,984
Gomez!

50
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,361
Forty-six!

51
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,528
Forty-six.

52
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,743
Empanadas!

53
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,691
Cheese, meat, pepper!

54
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,835
Cheese, meat, pepper! - Empanadas!

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,838
Good morning, Mary!

56
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,286
Dario.

57
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,792
I know you're not asleep, little brother.

58
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,716
I don't care if you don't it that.

59
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,884
I'll always be here.

60
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,805
Still warm.

61
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,393
Cheese, meat, pepper! Empanadas!

62
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,676
Johnny, the bus is here!

63
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,470
What's she doing here, Yonni?

64
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,221
You live with me now.

65
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm his wife, you bitch.

66
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,475
Why do you do this to yourself...? I saw the bus

67
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,060
I made your breakfast... -I know
68
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,181
She likes cooking breakfast

69
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,355
I cooked breakfast, it does.

70
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,484
Marta I did not say I don't want it.

71
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,985
Goys, guys!

72
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,489
Here comes Don Giovanni. Check this out.

73
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,283
We must find a solution to this.

74
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,212
Hey Mario.

75
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,091
You could not find a mistress on the other side of town?

76
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,967
Admit it, you're jealous.

77
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,345
Ahh.. Believe me, I am not.

78
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,222
No.

79
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,849
I love you!

80
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,723
Not dead yet, Segovia?

81
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,516
Not yet pastor.

82
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,851
Getting there.

83
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,399
Bolivian!

84
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,401
Loser!

85
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,466
Atacama Desert, CHILE AUGUST 5, 2010

86
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,386
Day 1

87
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,148
I found this on level 3.

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,441
So?

89
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,279
We put these mirrors in the cracks so we know if the mountain shifts.

90
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,156
She's an old mine.

91
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,659
The mountain is going to shift.

92
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,746
The mirrors are going to break.

93
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,123
I think we should get a health check on the ramp. We maybe look at...

94
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,125
The ramp is a good rock. - We may

95
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,378
The mine's got another 20 years left in there.

96
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,712
We maybe looking

97
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,173
at the weakness at the mountains's internal structure.

98
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,178
Marco, is my job to keep these men safe.

99
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,847
Correction.

100
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,641
Your job, Lucho ...

101
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,978
is to keep these men pulling out 250 tons a day.

102
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,313
250?

103
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,524
Your quote has gone up.

104
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,781
There's only so much gold in the mountain.

105
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,036
Dario.

106
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,212
All right, guys, We're going rock bottom today.

107
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,007
Where is Carlos Mamani?

108
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,009
Here.

109
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,050
Everyone!

110
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,971
Say hello to Mamani our new boy from Bolivia.

111
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,806
He's a tin digger.

112
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,894
What does a tin digger from Bolivia know about mining for gold?

113
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,105
Elvis, not today, uh?.

114
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,732
I got this.

115
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,360
Your retirement papers, Gomez!

116
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,362
Two weeks and you're a free man!

117
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,864
Sign them and get them back to me ah?

118
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,532
Bravo, Gomez!

119
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,742
Lobos, go!

120
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,409
Is that the only way in?

121
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,788
The only way in and the only way out.

122
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,671
I know Elvis didn't write his own lyrics, right?

123
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,631
That's blasphemy.

124
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,759
After you will tell me that he didn't not do his own dancing.

125
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,981
How much longer?

126
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,482
About an hour.

127
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,514
Quiet, Lobos.

128
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,476
Ok,huevones. You know what to do.

129
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,855
WORKSHOP 520 meters underground - 32oC

130
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,776
Getting together. Dario!

131
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,152
Yonni, what is that?  Aggh!

132
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,655
Bolivia! Hey, Bolivia!

133
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,699
Kananni, Kachani ... What's your name?

134
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,867
Mamani.

135
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,577
Whatever, come over here.

136
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,164
I know, I know. That's crazy, Elvis.

137
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,540
SHELTER 700 meters underground - 34 oC

138
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,584
Always looking for trouble.

139
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,337
Actually he thinks he's Elvis.

140
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,811
Rodrigo's offer me a job in his body shop.

141
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,982
50 a week. How you thinks about that?

142
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,860
¿50 a week? That's a joke, right?

143
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,820
And you're gonna be a father?

144
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,739
That's the problem.

145
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,657
You know what?

146
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,118
You're asking the wrong man.

147
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,328
And I have a terrible hangover.

148
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:17,083
I do not know, it's the same thing over and over with my dad.

149
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,128
What was that?

150
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,179
Thi's why we are here.

151
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
Yes, I can, can taste it.

152
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,559
Copper and gold. 1.200 an ounce.

153
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,643
Take it.

154
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,685
Take it.

155
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,315
Cholo, are you gonna stick it in your pocket for your momma?

156
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,358
What you say?

157
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,861
Everyone knows that Bolivians are a bunch of thieves.

158
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,654
It's stupid, you know that?

159
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,616
Chile stole this land.

160
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,369
After the war of 1881.

161
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,412
Who are the thieves?

162
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,624
... That was in 1881, you know?

163
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,879
Run now! Run!

164
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,685
What the hell?

165
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,417
Dario! -- Ah, Aaahhh!

166
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,837
Alex, pull me out!

167
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,506
Pull me out!

168
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,508
Do not let me fall!

169
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,386
- Do not let me fall! - Hold on, Dario!

170
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,554
Pull me out!

171
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,848
Collapse! Collapse!

172
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,725
Lobos! The carrier!

173
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,892
Gomez, come on!

174
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,311
Get out, get it out, Climb!

175
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,855
Pull me out! Let's go!

176
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,611
Come on! Come on man!

177
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,114
Dario! Climb, Dario!

178
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,287
Run!

179
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,955
Go!

180
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,874
Move it! Move it!

181
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,751
Out! Out!

182
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,377
Let's go, everyone!

183
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,754
Come on, Henriquez, let's go!

184
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,383
Get out! Get out!

185
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,471
Come on, get out!

186
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,307
Everyone hold on!

187
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:40,685
Wolves!

188
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,727
Come on, let's go!

189
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,607
Come on - Go up! - No, don't go up, no!

190
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,360
No, is coming from above! Get down to the refuge!

191
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,401
Get down!

192
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,250
Get to the pick-up!

193
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,755
Eh, wait, wait, wait for us!

194
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:09,631
Yonni!

195
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,424
I'm in!

196
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,842
Everybody in?

197
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,261
Up, up let's go up!

198
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,848
Rise! Go, go, go!

199
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,736
Run, come on!

200
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,821
Run!

201
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,489
Wait! Lucho!

202
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,531
Hold on!

203
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,285
Heeey! Lobos! Slow down! Slow down!

204
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,495
- Mario! - Lucho!

205
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,871
Mario, get on!

206
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,415
Help him up!

207
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,040
Mario, run!

208
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,292
Get on, Elvis!

209
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,794
Bolivian!

210
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,172
Get in, get in! Go, go!

211
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,214
Come on, man!

212
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,634
The Bolivian's got down!

213
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,260
Stop!

214
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,428
Lobos!

215
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,680
Lucho! Stop!

216
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,473
What's that?

217
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,225
Bolivia, come on!

218
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,188
Come on!

219
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,231
Mario!

220
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,065
Come on!

221
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Run, run, run!

222
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,405
Come on! Run, dammit!

223
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,574
All right, I got ya!

224
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,164
Shit.

225
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,879
Run!

226
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,922
Run!

227
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,436
Have we passed it?

228
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,354
Hope so.

229
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,399
It's OK, it's OK.

230
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,860
We'll gonna be OK, guys.

231
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,248
Go back! Is going from above!

232
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,333
Wrong way!

233
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,751
Come to the refuge! Get down!

234
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:10,585
Jonny!

235
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,627
Turn around!

236
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,256
Take care!

237
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,434
Stop! Stop!

238
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,477
No, no!

239
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:30,980
Go! Go! Go!

240
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,402
Gómez.

241
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,031
Gomez!

242
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,409
Alex!

243
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,747
Alex!

244
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,707
You all right?

245
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,000
Come here.

246
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,460
Quick!

247
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,421
Stay with him.

248
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,762
- You okay, Gomez? - Yeah.

249
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,224
Let's get you up.

250
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,226
Where is the pastor?

251
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,103
Henriquez.

252
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,607
Pull!

253
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,950
Elvis.

254
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,161
You okay man?

255
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,131
Boys.

256
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,009
You have to see this.

257
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,486
That's so big rock.

258
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,822
That's not a rock.

259
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,534
That's the heart of the mountain.

260
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,496
She finally broke.

261
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,542
Yes sir, yes

262
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:20,919


263
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,839
I got my people checking her now, yes

264
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,841
We'll keep it contained.

265
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,760
I'll make sure no one leaves.

266
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,890
GO, go, let's go!

267
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:34,933
Let's go!

268
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,563
Hey, Jose, there's been a collapse in the mine.

269
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,732
They're locking us down.

270
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,109
I'm calling the news.

271
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:47,904
Nobody can leave!

272
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,864
Wait, Don Jose!

273
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,991
Stay here. I'll call you later.

274
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,077
No! I'm coming with you. No!

275
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,084
Hello?

276
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,090
What?

277
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,553
A serious accident just occurred in San José mine ...

278
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,763
40 minutes outside Copiapo.

279
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:17,183
The number of miners trapped inside has yet to be determined ...

280
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:21,604
but the company estimates that 30 men were working below.

281
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,231
29 ...

282
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:25,984
30 ...

283
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,821
31, 32 ...

284
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,323
33.

285
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,746
We are all here.

286
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,416
I thank God for that.

287
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,797
The refuge is built for 30, so.

288
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,926
So we're OK.

289
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:55,930
Wha, wha, what you mean?

290
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,600
What you mean we're OK?

291
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,353
The ramp is blocked, Mario.

292
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,773
There is no road. We have no way out.

293
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,775
What about the chimneys?

294
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,817
There is ladders there.

295
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,319
Too dangerous.

296
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:16,326
I am not ready to sit down there in the refuge and wait for help.

297
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,368
Mario!

298
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,663
My job is simple.

299
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,542
I have a duty to the safety of these men.

300
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:30,006
At this moment, the refuge is the safest place, ah!.

301
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,343
There's a radio.

302
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,512
There's food.

303
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,224
Some of these guys need patching up.

304
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,523
You know me, Lucho.

305
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,568
There is no way out until there is no way out.

306
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,031
And I gonna check out those ladders.

307
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,576
Don Luis. Excuse me.

308
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,998
Coming with you.

309
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,084
All right, come on. Bolivian!

310
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,170
We should make a lot of... noise.

311
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,381
Burn tires, bang up pipes.

312
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,551
Make a big racket, you never know.

313
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,564
What are they doing?

314
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,441
We have to wait.

315
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,693
It's okay.

316
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,034
Hey! Talk to us!

317
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,869
Five hours we've been here!

318
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,203
We told you already.

319
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,206
The company has the situation under control.

320
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,583
Come on, huevón!

321
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:47,751
Do something!

322
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,211
OK, everybody shut up!

323
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,088
Or I'll have you removed!

324
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:57,093
Now, go home and wait to be contacted!

325
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,184
Who threw that?

326
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,602
I did.

327
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,271
What are you going to do? Shoot me?

328
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,564
Get off the property!

329
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,774
And you too!

330
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,567
All of you!

331
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,111
Get out of here!

332
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:16,946
Go home!

333
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,657
Come on!

334
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,082
Eh, where are you all going? Go back.

335
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,541
No, please, stay, we have to stand our ground, we have to stay put, come on.

336



337
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,046
What do you want us to do Maria?

338
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,548
They have not told us anything!

339
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,634
That's cause they're hiding something.

340
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,594
And there is a reason for that!

341
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,972
No, we have to stand our ground. We Have to stay put.

342
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,808
Whe're the rescue teams - Uh?

343
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,646
Whe're your rescue teams?

344
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,940
Whe're your drills?

345
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,193
Why isn't anybody doing anything?

346
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,071
My brother is down there!

347
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,948
We're not going anywhere!

348
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,241
We have to stay here!

349
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,117
She's right!

350
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,243
We want to stay!

351
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,453
Put that down! put that down!

352
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:06,955
Get used to it!

353
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:07,996
Stop it!

354
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,503
We're not going anywhere!

355
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,426
La Moneda Presidential Palace - Santiago de Chile

356
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:20,969
This is a private mine?

357
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,262
Yes sir.

358
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,973
Bohn and Kemeny. Chilean nationals.

359
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,184
33 men trapped underground.

360
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,479
And we don't even know if they're alive?

361
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,274
The responsibility bears in Bohn and Kemeny.

362
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,818
The government has no obligation to take a position.

363
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,779
We should have no position on this.

364
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,073
- What are they doing about it? - Nothing.

365
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,534
They don't have the capability.

366
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,703
I think the government should show its face.

367
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,873
I'd like to go up there and take a look at it, Sir.

368
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,916
You've never set foot in a mine, Laurence.

369
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,544
What makes you think you can make any difference?

370
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,047
You've been in the job for what? 4 months!.

371
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,173
If we do not react ...

372
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:00,467
if we bury our heads, it will look like we don't care.

373
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,345
That's bad for the industry and that's bad for Chile.

374
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,890
With all due respect, Sir, is not about us.

375
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,517
I believe we have a moral responsibility.

376
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,188
33 lives is a lot of dead people.

377
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:21,904
Go ahead!

378
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,451
Stop!

379
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,456
Come on, Alex.

380
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,924
Someone has to hear.

381
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,008
Lobos...

382
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,927
You're wasting your time.

383
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,809
Nobody is gonna hear us.

384
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,978
Nobody is gonna help us.

385
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,945
Hello, this is Luis Urzua.

386
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,741
I'll check first aid.

387
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,869
Hello, this is Luis Urzua. Can you hear me?

388
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,455
Hello, this is Luis Urzua. Can you hear me?

389
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,341
Fuck.

390
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,885
What?

391
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,637
There is no more ladder.

392
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:15,143
What do you mean no more ladder?

393
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,312
I'm telling you, it's not here.

394
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,077
No no.

395
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,537
No no.

396
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,544
Moving on.

397
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:43,546
Alex ...

398
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,758
Let's go back.

399
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,510
Okay.

400
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,220
Okay.

401
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:55,850
Dammit.

402
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:07,696
No, No!

403
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,905
Alex!

404
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,745
- Mario! - Hold on!

405
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,581
Our Father, who art in heaven ... WHO

406
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,960
Lord Jesus Christ ...

407
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,713
you who are the son of our creator ...

408
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:30,927
we ask you to grant us strength and fortitude ...

409
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:33,128
in our tribulation.

410
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,308
We ask you today ...

411
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,979
to protect our families.

412
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:46,818
DAY 2

413
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,404
The government. Hurry up.

414
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,919
Can you please let me through?

415
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,087
We want answers.

416
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,630
That's why I'm here, madam.

417
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:10,300
But I can't give you answers unless you let me in.

418
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,760
Or I'll can have them remove you.

419
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,303
Go ahead and try it.

420
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,473
If you want a little riot on TV tonight.

421
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,975
- You from the government, right? - Laurence Golborne.

422
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:19,934
Minister of Mining.

423
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,978
There are a lot of unhappy people up here, Laurence.

424
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,106
It's been two days and no one has told us anything!

425
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,983
We all know how this works.

426
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,902
The government shows up ...

427
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,988
Some good looking guy in a suit tells us how much they care.

428
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,950
How much are they going to stop at nothing to save them and do nothing!

429
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,286
We are not going to stand for it, Laurence!

430
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,331
I want you to promise me you do something.

431
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,168
I can promise we are going to do everything we can.

432
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,630
Okay?

433
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,966
Ok, go ahead.

434
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,427
- Move, move, let them through. - Thank you.

435
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,012
We want answers!

436
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,931
We want answers!

437
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,474
We want answers!

438
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,518
Let's say they are alive.

439
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,977
How long do they have?

440
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,312
Assuming ...

441
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,940
they are alive and they make it to the refuge ...

442
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,819
There is enough food and water for three days.

443
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,196
And what attempts have been made to reach them?

444
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,741
I sent a crew of my men down.

445
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,662
Couple of them were almost killed.

446
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,417
So, what can we do next, Mr. Castillo?

447
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,876
Nothing.

448
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,840
Well, what is the protocol, then?

449
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,049
Protocol?

450
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,388
This mountain is still moving.

451
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,974
I've been a miner for 25 years.

452
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,018
I've seen five collapses.

453
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,230
You know how many men we've saved?

454
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,733
No one!

455
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,038
Minister, can you tell us anything?

456
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,080
Yes.

457
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,792
The government is assessing the situation.

458
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:09,669
Are they alive, do you know?

459
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,379
What did they tell you?

460
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,382
The mine is extremely unstable.

461
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,093
And dangerous for rescuers.

462
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,135
Therefore ...

463
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:25,518
We have to suspend any further rescue attempts for the moment.

464
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,770
You promised!

465
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,438
Grab the minister!

466
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:29,981
Get inside!

467
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,275
Close the gates!

468
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,235
Is not right!

469
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:36,738
We are leaving!

470
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,782
This way, sir.

471
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,285
You promised!

472
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,163
- Please, it's my father! - My husband is down!

473
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,086
Get backwards!

474
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,629
Help us!

475
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,633
Lunch time.

476
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,474
I think we should wait for everyone.

477
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,351
Why?

478
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,770
- I'm hungry. - Dario.

479
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,439
This food is for an emergency.

480
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:15,068
What is this, Yonni? A picnic?

481
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,444
Take it easy.

482
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,779
Come on, I am going to eat, Yonni, come on.

483
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,073
Dario - I want you to move - Come on, Yonni - Use your head - Dario, Dario!!

484
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,033
Move!

485
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:24,994


486
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,164
Look at this crap.

487
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,750
Works for me.

488
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,674
You knew, didn't you?

489
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,177
You knew they never finished the ladders.

490
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,138
You knew that place was a death trap ...

491
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,265
but you let us come down, Lucho.

492
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,519
Listen ...

493
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,565
I asked Castillo about the ladders.

494
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,484
I asked him again and again.

495
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,403
He had the certification!

496
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,445
Don Lucho!

497
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,698
What's going on there?

498
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,200
Don Lucho!

499
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,038
Give it back to me!

500
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,751
Don Lucho! Look at this!

501
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,878
Give me the key.

502
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:16,838
Give me the key!

503
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,883
Son of a bitch!

504
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,472
What you doing, Dario?

505
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:26,890
Having lunch. - Oh, having lunch?

506
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,392
You're having lunch?

507
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:30,894
It is my food.

508
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,395
Calm down! Enough!

509
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:33,688
Aug!

510
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,565
Stop it! Stop it!

511
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,901
Calm down! Calm down!

512
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:41,071
So some cookies. What's the big deal?

513
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:44,741
What's the big deal?

514
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:47,327
Let me tell you.

515
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,496
There is no ladders to climb.

516
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,415
- And the chimneys just gave in.

517
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:56,711
And there is a huge rock blocking our only way out of here.

518
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,465
Guys.

519
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,552
We are buried alive.

520
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:06,596
That's the big deal.

521
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,934
This is all the food we have left to keep us alive!

522
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:13,478
We have to ration it carefully!

523
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,314
If we plan on survive down here until we are rescued!

524
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,607
Rescue us?

525
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,029
Do you hear any drills?

526
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,534
That's because there's no drilling for us.

527
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:32,080
We too far down.

528
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:38,086
It took one hundred years for the to dig this deep.

529
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:40,255
How long do you think it's gonna take?

530
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:44,426
Do you think the owners are gonna to spend that kind of money?

531
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:47,762
They didn't even finished the ladders!

532
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,774
They'll wait three days.

533
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,696
Then close the mine and put up the gravestones.

534
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:05,738
No.

535
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,200
No, no, no, no!

536
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:11,578
I don't believe that!

537
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:13,663
They'll dig us out!

538
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:17,542
And If they don't, our families will!

539
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,669
With their bare hands, IF IS NECESSARY!

540
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:27,427
I believe we'll make out of here because, because I choose to believe!

541
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,305
All 33 of us!

542
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,099
Now, you, Lucho, you believe whatever you want.

543
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,893
Is your problem.

544
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:55,997
Yep.

545
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,669
Yep. That's the way.

546
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,921
With that rescue better be pretty quick.

547
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,297
Yeah. Give me.

548
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,550
There's 18 cans of tuna.

549
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,636
165 grams per can.

550
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:11,179
33 men ...

551
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:14,015
is 90 grams per man.

552
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,059
as half a can.

553
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:19,437
A little more for the rest of your lives.

554
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,191
Anybody else?

555
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,901
Thank you.

556
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,361
Come on.

557
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,531
Eh! Thank you.

558
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,825
- Mario. - Give me.

559
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,592
Earlier today ...

560
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:52,637
The mining Company rescue teams made an attempt to enter the mine.

561
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,390
Through the ventilation chimneys.

562
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,144
But a secondary collapse blocked off any possible access to it.

563
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:01,730
The mining company has now relinquished control.

564
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:02,897
Are you watching this?

565
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:05,483
The Chilean government is taking over this operation.

566
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:06,443
Of course.

567
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:09,571
I need you up there, Sougarret. As soon as possible.

568
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,239
Golborne's going to need help.

569
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,117
And everyone I speak to says you're the best in the business.

570
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,119
Thank you Mr. President. I appreciate it.

571
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,746
And you appreciate that...

572
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:21,458
we cannot afford to fall on our asses in front of the whole country.

573
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,630
Which one of you is Laurence Golborne?

574
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,841
Can I help you?

575
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:34,804
Sougarret. Andre Sougarret.

576
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,850
I'm your new chief engineer.

577
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:41,811
Says who?

578
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,146
The President.

579
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,940
Now, assuming they're alive ...

580
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:47,609
we got 33 men down there.

581
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,861
They are running out of food and water.

582
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:52,030
But there is adequate air.

583
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:53,365
We know they can survive for a period of time ...

584
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,617
if they are relatively healthy ...

585
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,327
but we don't know that.

586
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,287
Some of them could be injured ...

587
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:02,165
some of them are in the early or late stages of silicosis.

588
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,668
Miner's lung disease.

589
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:08,838
What I do know is that if we don't get them out fast ...

590
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:11,883
we will gonna be bringing up 33 corpses.

591
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,678
Here's what we know:

592
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:20,475
the men were working in the lower half of the mine when it collapsed.

593
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,186
That puts them here, at the refuge.

594
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:25,814
A five meters wide space...

595
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:27,857
200 stories down.

596
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,151
My readings indicate ...

597
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:33,029
that a massive rock displaced itself here.

598
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:37,158
We are talking about 700,000 tons of diorite.

599
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,202
Or twice the mass ...

600
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:42,038
of the Empire State Building.

601
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:44,541
Obviously...

602
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:48,753
we can't go in through the ah.. front door, so to speak.

603
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:51,423
So, we gonna have to drill.

604
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,299
Best case scenario...

605
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,720
we reach them in eight days.

606
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,724
Eight days?

607
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,851
They're too far down, too deep.

608
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:04,269
Eight days?

609
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,854
But that's not the biggest problem.

610
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,105
It's the deviation factor.

611
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:10,525
Look. Here is the refuge.

612
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,528
If we run these drills 24 hours a day...

613
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,739
at full speed...

614
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,325
the drill is going to deviate like this...

615
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:22,037
or like this.

616
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,914
In fact it can bend 20 different ways.

617
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:30,045
And even if everything is going according to plan...

618
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,796
The odds are still against us.

619
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:38,636
So, what exactly are you saying?

620
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,307
What I'm saying, Minister...

621
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:45,602
is that there is less than 1% chance of finding them.

622
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:49,230
I need every drill you can get your hands on.

623
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:52,192
And I want them here as soon as possible.

624
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:01,326
DAY 3

625
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,829
- Mario. - Yes.

626
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:06,039
This one has less.

627
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:07,582
Which one?

628
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:08,624
This.

629
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,392
- Are very happy? - Yeah.

630
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,914
Al right, ladies.

631
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:52,168
Next meal in 24 hours.

632
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:55,588
How is supposed we survive on this?

633
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:59,009
We get hungry, we can always eat the Bolivian.

634
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,181
I've heard Bolivians taste like chicken.

635
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,566
The drills are here!

636
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:24,034
We did it!

637
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:03,323
Good.

638
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:10,288
You twist it.

639
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,498
and you twists all those wires together.

640
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:13,750
There will be light.

641
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:16,378
You can not live without light.

642
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:17,545
Tell me, Alex.

643
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:22,550
Why do you think, ah, having a boy is so much better than having a girl?

644
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:24,886
Yonni, what is it about that girls like you?

645
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,721
Face like horse's ass...

646
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:29,140
nappy hair, bad breath...

647
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:31,059
you fart in your asleep.

648
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,561
How come that ladies love you so much??

649
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:36,064
There 's 33 guys down  here and I'm the only one ...

650
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,483
who has a little something going on the side.

651
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:41,653
No, not in the house across the street, man!

652
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,279
At least, close the curtains!.

653
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,282
She doesn't has curtains.

654
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:53,623
Elvis is in the building.

655
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:59,629
Do you hear that?

656
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,467
It's a drill.

657
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,805
They're looking for us.

658
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:13,810
Is that not the sweetest sound you've ever heard?

659
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,982
Day 5

660
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:30,952
It is much more complicated than I ever thought.

661
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:34,372
I would really want to be there for Ivy's birthday.

662
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:37,334
Tell the girls I miss them so much.

663
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,211
Stop, stop!

664
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:42,172
Look, I will call you back.

665
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:50,347
What happened?

666
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:55,226
Sougarret! What happened?

667
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:58,146
Do you see this diorite ? Twice as hard as granite.

668
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,981
This is the problem.

669
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,649
We gonna need new drills.

670
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:04,235
OK, I can get you more drills, but we're running out of time.

671
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:05,195
Yeah.

672
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:07,364
Why are you burning through them so quickly?

673
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:09,991
Listen, I don't have six months to explain you...

674
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,202
the complex geology of the Atacama Desert, the direction of the drill...

675
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:13,328
This is not what I asked...

676
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,371
Do you want to be a miner?

677
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:16,164
Get a book, read the basics.

678
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:17,665
Start with orogenesis.

679
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:20,460
I've got 33 men down there I got to worry about.

680
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:24,005
Why don't you do what you need to do, be a suit, go talk to the media.

681
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,548
Let me do my job.

682
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:28,802
Why did they taking so much time?

683
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,555
Look. I know you are all growing restless.

684
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:35,225
I know you want answers.

685
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,061
But I'm here to assure you ...

686
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,855
that we are doing everything we possibly can...

687
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:42,857
to make contact with your loved ones.

688
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:45,151
We need to know if they're alive.

689
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:47,737
I don't have a definitive answer right now.

690
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:50,281
That's the truth.

691
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,951
We have 10 drills working 24 hours a day.

692
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,954
Look, I know how you must feel.

693
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,002
I'm going to expand accommodations for your families, 

694
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,798
I'm setting up a commisary...

695
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,842
a medical facility...

696
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,138
and a temporary school for your children.

697
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,432
That's all for now.

698
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,392
Minister!

699
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,728
We know the mine is very dangerous.

700
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:22,689
It can collapse in any moment! Ministre!

701
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:25,442
Hey, Minister of Mining.

702
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:27,485
Don't look at me like that.

703
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:29,529
Not gonna slap you.

704
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:33,000
I'm not saying 

705
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,951
I'm never gonna slap you...

706
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,706
You kept your word.

707
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:41,957
What's your name?

708
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,461
Maria Segovia.

709
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:46,129
Dario's wife

710
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:47,756
Sister.

711
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:49,132
He's my kid brother.

712
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,637
I'm not leaving without him.

713
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,068
They're everywhere! Please get them off me!

714
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:09,652
Get them off me!

715
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:11,613
They're everywhere!

716
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:13,990
I need to drink! OMG!

717
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:15,699
Dario.

718
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,622
I'm dying! I'm dying!

719
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,166
We are all dying. We are going to die.

720
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:25,167
It's OK.

721
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,047
There's a lot worse things in life than death.

722
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:33,343
How come, you have time for me?

723
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:36,388
Why, why don't you hate me like everybody else?

724
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,139
Why? Why?

725
00:51:39,432 --> 00:51:40,850
Hate...

726
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,645
is for children.

727
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:47,065
If we can all...

728
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:49,275
be good to each other...

729
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:51,894
we might find ...

730
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,572
our way out of here.

731
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:02,872
We can say a prayer together, if you like.

732
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:05,000
I do not know the words.

733
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:08,169
God doesn't care.

734
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:18,722
Merciful Father...

735
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,182
Merciful Father...

736
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:22,350
Take...

737
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:24,811
this boy.

738
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:26,396
Open his eyes...

739
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,190
so he can see.

740
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,695
I am sorry.

741
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:35,864
I am sorry.

742
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:37,240
It's OK.

743
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:40,201
It's OK.

744
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:41,953
Excuse me.

745
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:55,967
Maria, where to?

746
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:58,094
This way please.

747
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:04,768
OK, we're going to school! Single file, please!

748
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:10,482
Line in behind me, please.

749
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,112
That one.

750
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,741
- Thank you, Susie. - Nice to see you.

751
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,284
Excuse me.

752
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:22,744
What's your name?

753
00:53:22,994 --> 00:53:24,245
What she's being saying?

754
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,581
- What are you doing, Martha? - Her neme is Susana Valenzuela.

755
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,625
- Don't do this. - She's my husband's mistress. - Marta!

756
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:34,255
Sorry Susana, but only family members are permitted inside the fence, so...

757
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:36,216
No hookers allowed, sorry.

758
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:37,425
But I am his family.

759
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,344
I love him and I loves me too.

760
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:40,803
I loves you?

761
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:49,646
- Grab your stuff. - You can throw me out...

762
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:50,772
but, bitch, when Yonni...

763
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:52,941
comes up I will welcome up...

764
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:54,359
who he loves best!

765
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:59,614
DAY 8

766
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:01,092
What is this?

767
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,094
Food and water...

768
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,930
You have to make it last.

769
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,642
One tablespoon of tuna every other day ...

770
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:12,187
and a shot of water once a day.

771
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:13,688
That's is.

772
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:16,399
I running through a filter I made.

773
00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:20,403
It sucks, but it's just about drinkable, OK.

774
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,489
Alex.

775
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,740
Do yourself a favor.

776
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,910
If we get out of here...

777
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,914
find yourself a new line of work.

778
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:33,375
Shut up, Gomez.

779
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:34,751
Shut up!

780
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,213
Getting close.

781
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:40,757
Day 12

782
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:44,594
Adding the last pipe section.

783
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:01,319
Getting extremely close close, Sir. - Six!

784
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:08,618
We're down to the last six meters.

785
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,579
Five meters!

786
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:13,957
Four!

787
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:28,930
We need to mark it!

788
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:30,598
Johnny! Get some paint!

789
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:33,309
When the drill come through...!

790
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:35,812
we all have to make a lot of noise!

791
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:39,482
Some note, write a note! - you got it!

792
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:07,761
What?

793
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:10,221
What, what, what... Mario?

794
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:15,685
Is below us.

795
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,188
The thing's below us.

796
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:22,609
At Least they... are looking in the right place.

797
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,778
Still don't get yet, do you?

798
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:26,071
It took them this long...

799
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:27,822
to get that close!

800
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:29,949
They're not going to look for us forever, Mario.

801
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:31,826
We're starving, Mario!!

802
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:33,828
When they get back ...!

803
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,413
We will be dead!

804
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:44,339
Alex! - Alex!

805
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:09,072
I've been a miner all my life.

806
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:11,783
I let you down!

807
00:58:13,284 --> 00:58:15,120
I let myself down.

808
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:18,957
I knew this place was dangerous!

809
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,043
We all knew about this place!

810
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,545
Nobody is blaming you!

811
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:24,713
Do you want to blame somebody?

812
00:58:24,754 --> 00:58:27,424
Blame Castillo, blame the owners!

813
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:37,266
Where is Alex?

814
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,604
Nothing.

815
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:59,581
It's the deviation, Laurence.

816
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:01,249
We can't figure it out.

817
00:59:06,463 --> 00:59:08,631
We missed by 10 meters.

818
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:56,429
A hundred years of piss and shit...

819
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:57,806
Down there.

820
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:59,015
Alex!

821
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,809
Really want to do this?, don't do it alone.

822
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,436
- You are crazy? - Let's do it together.

823
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:06,147
Yes I¡m crazy! I am crazy!

824
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:08,692
I'm completely out of my mind.

825
01:00:10,568 --> 01:00:12,487
But you know what?

826
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:19,035
I have a daughter.

827
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,709
And a wife.

828
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:29,379
And you have a wife...

829
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:33,049
and a baby on the way...

830
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:40,056
and they're counting on you, Alex.

831
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:47,939
My baby.

832
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,276
We need you, man.

833
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:53,737
I need you.

834
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:00,368
And we've already burned through nine drills.

835
01:01:02,912 --> 01:01:05,665
This is becoming an impossible situation.

836
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:08,585
Sometimes impossible situations can take a little longer.

837
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,882
Laurence, our guys are already in acute starvation.

838
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:15,967
If they are even alive.

839
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,597
I thing we've got to start asking ourselves the really though questions.

840
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:25,769
How long do you think we can keep this on, uh?

841
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:33,693
DAY 14

842
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,324
What's going on here?

843
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:40,909
They know the rules, no families allowed. - I know, I know, but I just wish...

844
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:45,497
It's Don Francisco.

01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:54,497
Day 14 in the Atacama Desert and there is no news from the miners buried alive in the San Jose mine.

01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:59,497
Ten drills were spread on the dunes of this sector.

01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:03,797
Just one is working day and night.

01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:12,200
The sound from this drill is the only hope for the mothers and relatives praying for the lives

01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:13,500
of the loved ones.

01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:19,916
What we ask all around here today: is it too late?
 
845
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,916
Oh, shit! Damn, Mamani!

846
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:32,585
You made me shit! What, what are you doing here?

847
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,338
The same as you.

848
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,881
What's with the knife?

849
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:40,051
Are you going to cut me up and eat me?

850
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:42,887
They say Chileans taste like chicken.

851
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,143
Maybe you've noticed...

852
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:50,395
I don't have a lot of friends down here.

853
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:55,525
Where is your head lamp?

854
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,320
I never got one.

855
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,456
Here.
 
856
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,299
Listen, Mamani ...

857
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:24,179
Nobody is eating anybody while I'm here.

858
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:28,600
You got that?

859
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,940
I am so scared.

860
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:38,985
I don't want her growing up without a father.

861
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:45,533
Tell me it's going to be OK, it's just...

862
01:03:45,575 --> 01:03:47,327
just... - I can't.

863
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:52,165
Just tell me it's going to be OK.

864
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,626
Jessi, stop it!

865
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:58,004
You know it as well as I do...

866
01:03:58,046 --> 01:04:00,215
that it's not gonna be OK.

867
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,646
I have wanting to say something.

868
01:04:57,814 --> 01:04:59,566
I am sorry.

869
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:05,113
I'm very sorry that I stole from you guys.

870
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:09,159
Just hope one day you can forgive me.

871
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:13,371
I, I've been saving this for you.

872
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:25,592
I just wish I had a whole box to give you.

873
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,427
Thank you, Dario.

874
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:30,597
Thank you from all of us.

875
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:34,976
What I wouldn't do for...

876
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:39,814
one of your sister's empanadas right now.

877
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:15,225
Bless this food. Amen.

878
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:49,509
Oh Lord.

879
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,056
My life.

880
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:07,986
Katty.

881
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:30,925
It's gonna be OK.

882
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,557
Mom, what are you doing here?

883
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,726
Look how skinny you are, Yonni.

884
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:41,978
Eat!.

885
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:44,189
Charquicán.

886
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:46,024
Your favorite.

887
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:47,066
Excuse me.

888
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:52,989
Fresh milk.

889
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:54,240
Anyone?

890
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:46,334
I just...

891
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:51,673
I just want you to know ...

892
01:08:53,925 --> 01:08:55,969
that I...

893
01:08:57,804 --> 01:09:00,015
couldn't be prouder...

894
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:02,475
to share with you...

895
01:09:03,476 --> 01:09:05,729
this Last meal,

896
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,480
with all of you.

897
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,160
If that's it...

898
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,831
this is our last supper...

899
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:30,170
I am officially handing my retirement papers.

900
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,671
I quit!

901
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:10,794
You called it off.

902
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:14,756
It wasn't my decision.

903
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:16,549
And this?

904
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:17,801
A memorial?

905
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:22,347
A poem for the gravestones, a few words by Pablo Neruda.

906
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:23,765
I has nothing to do with me.

907
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,226
This is bullshit. Look.

908
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:28,728
Those people out there are counting on us.

909
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,647
You and me.

910
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:32,649
33 men underground.

911
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:36,152
300 mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters...

912
01:10:36,194 --> 01:10:37,779
and we are their only hope.

913
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:40,782
It's not about it, Laurence. It's a false hope.

914
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:43,076
- And you're giving up! - Three days food?

915
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:45,036
That's all they had.

916
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,622
They're down there for 16 days.

917
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:50,291
You're giving these families false hope - Look.

918
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:53,003
- They can survive 40 days without food. - Not under those conditions, Laurence.

919
01:10:53,044 --> 01:10:55,880
It's 100 F down there. Do you know what is like?

920
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:57,048
It's a tomb!

921
01:10:58,508 --> 01:11:00,593
I understand how you feel. I feel the same.

922
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:02,846
I know that your heart is in the right place.

923
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:03,972
And what is yours?

924
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:06,224
It's not about you!

925
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,642
It's over!

926
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:13,023
It's over, Laurence.

927
01:13:28,074 --> 01:13:29,743
I have something for you.

928
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:31,243
Hi.

929
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:34,748
The best empanada in town.

930
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:48,845
I mean well.

931
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:51,222
I do.

932
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:54,559
I say what I think.

933
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:57,687
That's my trouble.

934
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:03,943
I want to please.

935
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:08,114
Somehow, I...

936
01:14:10,116 --> 01:14:12,410
I always find a way to miss.

937
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:14,454
Not by miles, but.

938
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:19,125
I can't seem to learn from my mistakes.

939
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,467
You have to sleep, you.

940
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:33,973
Thank you.

941
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,500
We Heard the news, Minister. I'm sorry.

942
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,919
Do not be. No one has died yet.

943
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,087
Restart the drill.

944
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:05,964
You've got it. You have the azimuth?

945
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,174
Uh?

946
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:11,386
The azimuth. The angle, Minister.

947
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,055
Hey, Laurence.

948
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:18,018
You need some help?

949
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,604
What's on your mind?

950
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:24,482
Ground.

951
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:28,319
Refuge.

952
01:15:32,532 --> 01:15:33,742
Drill.

953
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,038
Look at the direction.

954
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:41,249
Look how I drew it.

955
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,043
Yes, but I don't get your point.

956
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:45,086
So we learn from our mistakes.

957
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:47,630
Let the toughness of the rock be our guide.

958
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:51,301
Your drill is facing in the wrong direction.

959
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:52,427
Exactly.

960
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:54,179
This doesn't make any sense.

961
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,097
Only if you aim to...

962
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,766
Miss.

963
01:15:58,058 --> 01:15:59,476
You're crazy?

964
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:02,437
You'll bring the mountain down on top of these men.

965
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:06,483
Stop trying to think like you're some kind of...

966
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:27,879
Yes! We use the deviation of measurements from our last miss.

967
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:30,548
and we already know where the rock is at his most dense.

968
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,885
So simple!.

969
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:35,553
Learn from your mistakes.

970
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:37,180
Aim to miss.

971
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:46,147
Now you think it like a miner.

972
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:25,729
DAY 17

973
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:31,609
If I have a girl...

974
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:35,447
I'm gonna call her Esperanza (Hope).

975
01:17:36,614 --> 01:17:38,199
Jessi would like that.

976
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:39,617
Comfort, pastor.

977
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,536
Drink.

978
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,957
Stay with me, pastor.

979
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:49,544
Our Father, who art in heaven...

980
01:17:51,796 --> 01:17:53,548
hallowed be thy name.

981
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,216
Let your kingdom come.

982
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:57,093
Forgive me, Lord.

983
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:04,142
Give us this day our daily bread...

984
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:08,563
and forgive us our trespasses...

985
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:12,192
as we forgive...

986
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:17,155
Those who trespass against us.

987
01:18:19,282 --> 01:18:22,994
Do not let us be tempted...

988
01:18:24,537 --> 01:18:27,290
and deliver us from evil.

989
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,667
Amen.

990
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,536
Drill.

991
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:51,624
Drill!

992
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,126
Drill!

993
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:56,171
Hey!

994
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,721
A drill!

995
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:07,682
It's here!

996
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:09,392
It's here!

997
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:13,938
Look, look! Look!

998
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,483
Look! Hey, guys!

999
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:39,172
We are here!

1000
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:52,644
Shhhh! I hear something.

1001
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:00,652
Someone is alive.

1002
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:03,571
Shut down the generators!

1003
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:07,242
Could be rock fall.

1004
01:21:07,283 --> 01:21:08,284
Stethoscope.

1005
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,621
Here.

1006
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:29,514
Get the note!

1007
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:31,057
Get the note!

1008
01:21:56,249 --> 01:21:57,375
Stop!

1009
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:03,256
It's been painted.

1010
01:22:06,926 --> 01:22:09,012
- Are you sure it was not there before? - Definitely not, Sir.

1011
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,096
There's something there.

1012
01:22:10,138 --> 01:22:11,222
Where?

1013
01:22:27,405 --> 01:22:28,698
Oh my God!

1014
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:34,329
This message comes to us from the depths...

1015
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:35,580
of the earth.

1016
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:38,291
From the very hands of our miners.

1017
01:22:40,418 --> 01:22:43,755
"We are all well in the refuge.

1018
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:45,256
The 33".

01:22:47,597 --> 01:22:50,256
Viva Chile, mierda!

1019
01:22:58,108 --> 01:23:02,275
Thank you! ahhh, thank you!

1020
01:23:04,317 --> 01:23:06,610
Susi! Marta!

1021
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:11,782
Its alive!

1022
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:14,327
They are safe!

1023
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:15,954
They are all safe!

1024
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,168
I knew you could do it.

1025
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:26,256
We found them, now we have to get them out.

1026
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:29,634
Nobody has ever done anything like this before.

01:23:32,631 --> 01:23:35,634
Chi... Leee! Chi...Chi...Chi... le! le! le!

01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:38,134
Chilean miners!


1027
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,070
God bless our miners!

1028
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:50,530
God bless them!

1029
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,453
Is Luis Urzua, the supervisor.

1030
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:03,793
Can you hear me?

1031
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:04,835
Yes, I can hear you.

1032
01:24:05,378 --> 01:24:06,963


1033
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:11,426
This is Laurence Golborne, the Minister of mining.

1034
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:13,011
How are you?

1035
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:18,850
17 days is a long time.

1036
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:23,021
And after 17 days, you would not blame rescuers for losing hope...

1037
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:27,484
Until they got the sign that is that 33 miners, all of them ...

1038
01:24:27,525 --> 01:24:28,985
2000 feet down...

1039
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:30,195
were OK.

01:24:30,227 --> 01:24:37,195
On this very moment, food and medicines, and the food is actually NASA-designed, liquid food...  

01:24:37,527 --> 01:24:41,595
as the miner's conditions do not allow them digesting solid food, yet...
1040
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:46,395
are being sent down to the mine trough a 14 cm diameter pipe.

01:24:46,878 --> 01:24:50,006
The families today get a chance to do what they do once a week.

1041
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,468
 They get to meet via a videoconference with their loved ones below...

1042
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,636
for about 8 minutes.

1043
01:24:54,678 --> 01:24:57,931
Three platforms are now in place specialized in deep drilling.

1044
01:24:57,972 --> 01:24:59,724
The Australian drill, Plan A ...

1045
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:02,727
is going directly into the miner's  emergency shelter...

1046
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,105
Which is 2300 feet below the surface.

1047
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:09,150
Plan C is this system for oil drilling, provided by Canadians.

1048
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:12,821
It allows drilling a tube big enough for a man getting into.

1049
01:25:12,862 --> 01:25:15,573
Down here is Plan B.

1050
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:17,659
Now, this is a T-130 drill. - OK

1051
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:20,453
That is gonna be manned by the US engineer ...

1052
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:21,579
Jeff Hart.

1053
01:25:21,621 --> 01:25:23,123
It is a pretty blunt instrument.

1054
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:25,125
It's like a huge jackhammer.

1055
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:27,877
But it could get through the ground very quickly.

1056
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:29,170
One guy is a drug problem...

1057
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:31,715
another suffers from depression, another guy is bipolar.

1058
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:35,802
These men are going to start killing each other...

1059
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:37,512
If they're down for much longer.

1060
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:39,764
And this is going to go on for 3 months ...

1061
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:40,890
at least.

1062
01:25:40,932 --> 01:25:41,932
Three months?

1063
01:25:43,226 --> 01:25:44,894
- Are you recording? - ahhh...

1064
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:48,440
DAY 20

1065
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:50,734
My name is Mario Sepulveda.

1066
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:53,236
Welcome to the...

1067
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:56,781
San Jose mine resort Hilton.

1068
01:25:56,823 --> 01:25:58,324
We'll take a look around.

1069
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:01,494
Guys, more pigeons coming in!

1070
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,455
Nikes!

1071
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:07,542
And iPods for everyone!

1072
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,421
Hey, Gomez! Here are your dirty magazines.

1073
01:26:22,724 --> 01:26:24,684
- Mario? - Hi dad, hi.

1074
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:26,811
- Can you hear us? - Can you hear us, dad?

1075
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:28,772
Yes Yes.

1076
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:31,149
How are you? Other than skinny.

1077
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,025
Katty.

1078
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,193
You're so skinny.

1079
01:26:33,234 --> 01:26:34,778
Scarlett.

1080
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,532
It's okay, dad.

1081
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:46,081
Today was hard day for the rescuers of the San Jose mine.

1082
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:50,418
After drilling far down, the Australian drill, Plan A ...

1083
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:54,047
suffered a serious setback. When drilling, a hydraulic pipe burst...

1084
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:56,758
disabling the drill completely.

1085
01:26:58,718 --> 01:26:59,718
Here it is.

1086
01:27:00,887 --> 01:27:03,723
I could not see if it was a boy or a girl.

1087
01:27:04,724 --> 01:27:06,434
Let it be a surprise, Alex.

1088
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,812
I don't wanna know.

1089
01:27:10,021 --> 01:27:12,148
As long as you two are good.

1090
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,192
That's all that matters.

1091
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:15,234
Dad ...

1092
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:17,278
Alex.

1093
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:19,656
I've missed you.

1094
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:26,329
Another one of us.

1095
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:28,123
No no no.

1096
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:30,709
People do not need to see that.

1097
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,419
People don't need to see that, people don't need to see that.

1098
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,006
And the fact that I was in the military...

1099
01:27:36,047 --> 01:27:39,426
allowed me to know how to organize people.

1100
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,728
You're famous, Mario.

1101
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:52,355
Don Francisco was here.

1102
01:27:53,064 --> 01:27:54,733
He said last night ...

1103
01:27:54,774 --> 01:27:57,485
You were the most famous man in Chile.

1104
01:27:58,445 --> 01:28:00,280
Don Francisco said that?

1105
01:28:00,613 --> 01:28:02,866
We will get you out.

1106
01:28:02,907 --> 01:28:05,076
And to see your families...

1107
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:06,202
by Christmas.

1108
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:12,542
We'll be waiting for you. Goodbye and God bless.

1109
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:14,294
- All right, he's gone. - Christmas?

1110
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,504
- Listen, listen!. - There are three months!

1111
01:28:17,505 --> 01:28:19,174
No, listen! Listen to me!

1112
01:28:19,215 --> 01:28:21,801
Disappointing news from Chile. The Canadian drill, Plan C ...

1113
01:28:21,843 --> 01:28:26,556
has been shut down indefinitely due to unexpected technical difficulties.

1114
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:29,434
The drill and its team, who the families had high hopes for...

1115
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:30,769
is now heading home.

1116
01:28:58,296 --> 01:29:00,090
Have your husband sign them.

1117
01:29:01,508 --> 01:29:02,717
And please ...

1118
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:05,637
If you have any questions, call me. OK?

1119
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,014
I'm gonna read it and... talk to Mario.

1120
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:10,183
We're talking about a...

1121
01:29:12,018 --> 01:29:14,437
a lot of money.

1122
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:15,730
Katty ...

1123
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:18,441
keep it to yourself.

1124
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,151


1125
01:29:20,944 --> 01:29:22,570
How are you?

1126
01:29:22,612 --> 01:29:26,032
Somehow I'll give you enough money so that your husbands don't have to work for a year.

1127
01:29:27,951 --> 01:29:30,787
I'm gonna give each $10,000.

1128
01:29:53,852 --> 01:29:55,895
Dario.

1129
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:56,938
Dario.

1130
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:07,991
The huge slab of rock, the so called "mega stone"...

1131
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:10,660
twice the size of the Empire State Building...

1132
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:13,329
is believed to shift in the last few hours.

1133
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:15,957
This has added yet more urgency...

1134
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:18,251
to the rescue effort here at the surface.

1135
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,462
DAY 50

1136
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,385
We hit steel.

1137
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:31,139
Looks like a horizontal support beam or something.

1138
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:32,807
We busted the bit.

1139
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:35,769
The bitch is stuck down in that borehole, like a dummy.

1140
01:30:36,269 --> 01:30:37,604
Replace the bit.

1141
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:41,358
No, the piece of bit is 1420 feet down there.

1142
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:43,860
We are not drilling until we get that piece of bit out of there.

1143
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:45,236
However that is.

1144
01:30:45,528 --> 01:30:49,741
I'm calling my contacts in Brazil getting some big old magnets.

1145
01:30:56,623 --> 01:30:59,125
Mario, there's no drills. They're not drilling.

1146
01:31:01,127 --> 01:31:02,545
Are you listening to me?

1147
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:03,963
OK, all right.

1148
01:31:04,005 --> 01:31:05,632
Hey, Yonni, listen to this.

1149
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:06,716
"Marta...

1150
01:31:06,758 --> 01:31:09,094
the wife of miner Yonni Barrios...

1151
01:31:09,135 --> 01:31:12,138
had Yonni's mistress removed from Camp Hope...

1152
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,932
for the third time.

1153
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:19,396
Susi, Yonni's mistress...

1154
01:31:19,437 --> 01:31:21,356
is happy being a home wrecker. "

1155
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:25,360
Now the whole world thinks that Susi is a whore...

1156
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:28,279
and that I am a two-time scumbag.

1157
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:29,698
Well...

1158
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:31,700
That's not right.

1159
01:31:32,742 --> 01:31:34,285
I cannot believe this.

1160
01:31:34,327 --> 01:31:36,996
"Our fearless leader, Super Mario...

1161
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:39,040
Who would tell anyone who is willing to listen...

1162
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:42,460
than he is the one solely responsible for our survival...

1163
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:45,380
has been offered a book deal...

1164
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:47,966
for an undisclosed sum. "

1165
01:31:52,595 --> 01:31:53,930
An undisclosed sum, uh?

1166
01:31:55,598 --> 01:31:56,766
What's that sum, Mario?

1167
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,688
Were you planning on ...?

1168
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,690
have any of us in this book, do you?

1169
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:06,693
- Did you do it? - Of course he did it.

1170
01:32:06,735 --> 01:32:08,403
You know what, Fearless Leader?

1171
01:32:08,445 --> 01:32:10,655
We're going to get along  just fine without you.

1172
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:12,240
Do you really think I need you?

1173
01:32:12,824 --> 01:32:13,825
Any of you?

1174
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:21,416
You know, a leader...

1175
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:25,545
makes sure you don't starve.

1176
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:28,381
The leader keeps the lights on.

1177
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:30,925
No, no, no, you got some help with the lights on.

1178
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:31,967
Yes, me.

1179
01:32:32,302 --> 01:32:33,345
What you doing?

1180
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,940
- Do not need you! - This is your fault!

1181
01:32:36,389 --> 01:32:38,433
We've had enough.

1182
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:39,851
Get out! Get out of here!

1183
01:32:41,686 --> 01:32:43,188
The leader never gives up.

1184
01:32:46,024 --> 01:32:48,109
You know?

1185
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:51,404
You would not be here if it wasn't for me.

1186
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:54,449
I never asked for this.

1187
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:57,702
You gave it to me.

1188
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:06,169
You listen to me, Golborne.

1189
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:08,755
None of your drills are working.

1190
01:33:08,797 --> 01:33:10,965
That is unacceptable!

1191
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:13,385
We spent millions of dollars bringing that down.

1192
01:33:13,426 --> 01:33:14,969
and we made no secret of that.

1193
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:18,014
Now you tell me the American drill is down?

1194
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:19,599
The drill bit fractured in the borehole...

1195
01:33:19,641 --> 01:33:21,643
but we are magnets coming in from Brazil.

1196
01:33:21,685 --> 01:33:22,852
Heavy duty magnets.

1197
01:33:22,894 --> 01:33:24,479
I don't want to hear about your magnets!

1198
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:26,314
The mine is crumbling!

1199
01:33:26,356 --> 01:33:28,233
We are running out of time, Golborne.

1200
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:36,700
There's talks of lawsuits and...

1201
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:39,411
criminal charges from the families.

1202
01:33:39,452 --> 01:33:41,955
I don't have to tell you...

1203
01:33:41,996 --> 01:33:43,832
the miners occupy...

1204
01:33:43,873 --> 01:33:47,877
a privileged position in the affections of the Chilean people.

1205
01:33:47,919 --> 01:33:52,090
The last thing we need is these men dying! ...

1206
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:54,259
with the whole world watching!

1207
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,845
I don't think it is going too far to say...

1208
01:33:56,886 --> 01:34:00,390
That the future of this administration depends on the outcome.

1209
01:34:00,432 --> 01:34:01,891
Mr. President, I can...

1210
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:11,359
DAY 54

1211
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,249
Dario.

1212
01:34:48,897 --> 01:34:50,440
Would you want to say something to me?

1213
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:54,903
You know Maria, my sister, right?

1214
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:56,946
Yeah.

1215
01:34:59,115 --> 01:35:02,660
I've been mad at her all my life.

1216
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:06,915
She abandoned me when I was just a kid.

1217
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:08,792
I mean, she was a kid also...

1218
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:11,586
and she had already raised my five siblings.

1219
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:15,632
She just needed her own life.

1220
01:35:16,299 --> 01:35:18,968
I couldn't see that before.

1221
01:35:22,305 --> 01:35:25,266
I know she's up there, I know she's waiting for me, but...

1222
01:35:25,975 --> 01:35:27,769
What I am supposed to say?

1223
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:30,230
I mean, what am I supposed to do when we get out?

1224
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:31,815
If we get out.

1225
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:35,610
You hug her...

1226
01:35:35,652 --> 01:35:37,654
and cry like a baby.

1227
01:35:39,155 --> 01:35:42,283
and forgive everything she's ever done.

1228
01:35:43,535 --> 01:35:46,037
And pray to God that she forgives you.

1229
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,377
She's your family.

1230
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:56,715
Mara is the only family you've got.

1231
01:36:01,302 --> 01:36:02,846
Family...

1232
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:08,226
Family is all we have.

1233
01:36:46,681 --> 01:36:48,224
That's my iPod.

1234
01:36:48,725 --> 01:36:51,019
You are a thief, Bolivian Indian.

1235
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:53,355
- We all have iPods. - It is my iPod.

1236
01:36:53,396 --> 01:36:55,523
- Not yours. - Give me my iPod!

1237
01:36:55,565 --> 01:36:57,067
- Not yours! - Give me my iPod!

1238
01:36:58,693 --> 01:37:00,570
Not yours, Elvis!

1239
01:37:03,365 --> 01:37:04,908
Mamani!

1240
01:37:04,949 --> 01:37:06,034
Stop!

1241
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:07,994
Look at me!

1242
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:09,371
Look, look at me!

1243
01:37:09,746 --> 01:37:12,749
That's the devil guiding hand.

1244
01:37:14,793 --> 01:37:16,252
Give it to me.

1245
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:24,219
You are gonna kill a man...

1246
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,096
over this piece of shit?

1247
01:37:28,264 --> 01:37:29,432
For why?

1248
01:37:32,435 --> 01:37:34,604
Because some fat cat says he will give us some money?

1249
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:37,232
Because some whore writes some gossip...

1250
01:37:37,273 --> 01:37:38,942
about your family life?

1251
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:41,569
Come over here. Come over here.

1252
01:37:41,611 --> 01:37:43,238
So what?

1253
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:46,282
So, some people would bring your balls because you're a Bolivian, you're a Bolivian?

1254
01:37:46,324 --> 01:37:48,743
What it that, what is that?

1255
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:49,785
Come on.

1256
01:37:49,953 --> 01:37:52,080
What about me?

1257
01:37:52,122 --> 01:37:55,417
Calling myself the leader down here.

1258
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:58,920
Throwing my way around thinking...

1259
01:37:58,962 --> 01:38:00,922
you know, I am, that I, that I did everything on my own.

1260
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:01,965
No.

1261
01:38:02,465 --> 01:38:04,259
This is not me.

1262
01:38:04,676 --> 01:38:07,095
This is not us.

1263
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:09,931
We, we all know what is up there.

1264
01:38:09,973 --> 01:38:11,099
Is a circus.

1265
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:14,310
Unless not get too far ahead of ourselves.

1266
01:38:14,352 --> 01:38:15,812
Unless don't do that...

1267
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:18,273
Because we are not going to get anything out of this.

1268
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:19,314
Anything.

1269
01:38:19,482 --> 01:38:23,278
We walked in as miners and we will walk out as...

1270
01:38:24,821 --> 01:38:26,322
miners.

1271
01:38:30,452 --> 01:38:32,620
I didn't sign the book deal.

1272
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:35,290
Was I going to?

1273
01:38:35,331 --> 01:38:36,624
Yes.

1274
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:39,961
Did I want to provide for my family and for my kids?

1275
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:42,047
Yeah!. But I didn't.

1276
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:43,882
I didn't. Why?

1277
01:38:48,178 --> 01:38:49,637
Because of you.

1278
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,473
Because of you are, you are my brothers.

1279
01:38:51,514 --> 01:38:54,517
If we want stay brothers, we gonna pull together...

1280
01:38:55,393 --> 01:38:57,187
and to get out of here.

1281
01:38:59,856 --> 01:39:00,982
Yeah.

1282
01:39:06,863 --> 01:39:08,031
I'm sorry.

1283
01:39:10,867 --> 01:39:12,535
I'm very sorry.

1284
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:31,054
Welcome back, Mario.

1285
01:39:32,263 --> 01:39:33,556
Welcome back.

1286
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:41,064
Here it comes!

1287
01:39:50,073 --> 01:39:51,199
I knew It! Yes!

1288
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:54,077
Back to work!

1289
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:55,912
Vicente! Hey!

1290
01:39:55,954 --> 01:39:57,372
Come on, get up.

1291
01:39:57,414 --> 01:39:59,165
Let's get ourselves some miners.

1292
01:39:59,207 --> 01:40:00,583
We got it out. We're gonna restart.

1293
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,982
Lieutenant.

1294
01:40:25,108 --> 01:40:27,110
Take down the fence.

1295
01:40:27,152 --> 01:40:28,278
All of it.

1296
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:29,320
Yes sir.

1297
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:43,001
Come in. Everyone.

1298
01:40:44,753 --> 01:40:47,630
DAY 58

1299
01:41:02,145 --> 01:41:05,940
You're coming too close to an iron support beams.

1300
01:41:05,982 --> 01:41:09,778
If she hits those beams, that drill's a goner.

1301
01:41:09,819 --> 01:41:12,113
We're going to have to clear it ourselves from down here.

1302
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:13,531
How?

1303
01:41:15,658 --> 01:41:17,160
With a controlled explosion.

1304
01:41:17,202 --> 01:41:20,121
No, no, Don Lucho. That's a negative.

1305
01:41:20,163 --> 01:41:23,792
The mountain is completely unstable. You need another option.

1306
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:25,168
We know.

1307
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:29,255
We know is unstable...

1308
01:41:29,297 --> 01:41:30,465
but it's the only way.

1309
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:35,136
We are all ready to get out of here...

1310
01:41:35,178 --> 01:41:36,846
or die trying.

1311
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:39,516
Alex!

1312
01:41:39,557 --> 01:41:40,517
Mario!

1313
01:41:40,558 --> 01:41:43,770
We're going to booster the beam with these timbers here.

1314
01:41:43,812 --> 01:41:46,856
The charges will be placed there, according to this.

1315
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:55,657
Jessi.

1316
01:41:57,575 --> 01:41:58,993
I'll take you to the hospital.

1317
01:41:59,035 --> 01:42:00,829
No, I'm staying here, Don Jose.

1318
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:01,871
I'm not leaving Alex.

1319
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:18,888
Susi.

1320
01:42:19,931 --> 01:42:21,182
From Yonni.

1321
01:42:23,018 --> 01:42:24,394
He wrote to me.

1322
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:26,187
Oh my God.

1323
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:29,357
He spoke to the Minister. You belong to Camp Hope with that.

1324
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:30,608
- I can do come in? - Yes.

1325
01:42:31,067 --> 01:42:33,403
Martha, why are you leaving us?

1326
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:35,155
I decided to leave him.

1327
01:42:35,196 --> 01:42:36,948
He doesn't deserves a woman like me.

1328
01:42:37,407 --> 01:42:39,743
Besides, he farts in his sleep.

1329
01:42:39,784 --> 01:42:40,784
Excuse me.

01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,100

Yes, come on here! - OK, OK

01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:45,700
Sit down!

01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,500
Thank you! Save...!

01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:53,500
Rescue Carlos Mamani. My son, OK? - OK - Don't worry Jack

01:42:54,100 --> 01:43:01,500
Thank you, thank you! Carlos Mamani, OK? - You are friends now!

1330
01:43:02,766 --> 01:43:04,476
Are you ladies ready? -- Yeaah!!

1331
01:43:04,934 --> 01:43:06,561
How nice for a first day, huh, Bolivia?

1332
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:09,898
Sure you put in for some overtime. Come on, baby.

1333
01:43:09,939 --> 01:43:10,774
Three...!

1334
01:43:10,815 --> 01:43:11,858
Two...

1335
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:12,900
One!

1336
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:41,513
Look!

1337
01:43:42,847 --> 01:43:44,307
There she comes!

1338
01:43:53,024 --> 01:43:54,025
All right, We're in!

1339
01:43:57,612 --> 01:43:59,948
You did! Thank you, Jeff!

1340
01:44:01,449 --> 01:44:03,201
You're the new national hero of Chile.

1341
01:44:03,493 --> 01:44:05,954
Painted in the colors of the national flag...

1342
01:44:05,995 --> 01:44:07,956
This is Phoenix 1...

1343
01:44:07,997 --> 01:44:10,500
the rescue capsule in which the Chilean authorities...

1344
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:12,168
along with most of the world...

1345
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:13,837
are now their hopes pinned on.

1346
01:44:13,878 --> 01:44:18,174
This metal cage is designed to haul up the 33 miners one by one...

1347
01:44:18,216 --> 01:44:20,010
from 700 meters below ground...

1348
01:44:20,468 --> 01:44:23,805
to the sunlight they haven't see now for 62 days.

1349
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:28,309
Open up.

1350
01:44:34,691 --> 01:44:35,692

1351
01:44:44,909 --> 01:44:46,494
Is sinking.

1352
01:44:47,495 --> 01:44:49,039
How fast?

1353
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,331
Too fast.

1354
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:52,834
Do you see this green line?

1355
01:44:52,876 --> 01:44:55,211
We mark this down yesterday.

1356
01:44:55,712 --> 01:44:57,672
Do you see how far is come down?

1357
01:44:57,714 --> 01:45:00,592
I think the explosion is done this job.

1358
01:45:01,384 --> 01:45:03,887
700,000 tons of rock...

1359
01:45:04,262 --> 01:45:08,099
Sitting just directly  over their heads.

1360
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:11,561
Is not a question of if it falls, but when.

1361
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:15,065
OK guys, this is the situation:

1362
01:45:15,732 --> 01:45:18,526
We just don't have time to reinforce the shaft.

1363
01:45:19,235 --> 01:45:21,863
If anything happens to the Phoenix capsule...

1364
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:25,909
if its mechanism fails, or the walls of the shaft collapse...

1365
01:45:26,785 --> 01:45:28,912
I have to tell you...

1366
01:45:28,953 --> 01:45:32,082
that there is a real possibility we can't get you guys out.

1367
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:36,169
The guy who goes first...

1368
01:45:36,211 --> 01:45:38,380
will be in the greatest danger.

1369
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:42,384
But could also be the only one to make it out.

1370
01:45:42,425 --> 01:45:44,636
You decide who that man will be.

1371
01:45:45,053 --> 01:45:48,431
October 13, 2010

1372
01:45:49,224 --> 01:45:52,060
DAY 69

1373
01:46:41,443 --> 01:46:42,485
Phoenix.

1374
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:54,289
Sir?

1375
01:46:54,706 --> 01:46:56,708
We're ready for initiation.

1376
01:47:21,399 --> 01:47:22,859
- Yea! - Good luck, Alex!

1377
01:47:31,159 --> 01:47:33,161
See you all, men...

1378
01:47:35,413 --> 01:47:36,581
Up there. OK? OK

1379
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:45,382


1380
01:48:03,775 --> 01:48:05,068
We are ready.

1381
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:07,779
Sir, they're good to go.

1382
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:09,698
Good.

1383
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:14,327
On the count of three, begin the ascent.

1384
01:48:14,369 --> 01:48:15,412
SBeginning the ascent in...

1385
01:48:15,453 --> 01:48:16,621
3, 2...

1386
01:48:19,249 --> 01:48:20,458
Come on!

1387
01:48:43,773 --> 01:48:45,942
700 meters.

1388
01:48:46,609 --> 01:48:48,486
Mr. Vega is looking good.

1389
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:07,630
The capsule is holding steady. 500 m.

1390
01:49:07,672 --> 01:49:08,840
500 meters mark.

1391
01:49:11,593 --> 01:49:14,387
Look, his heart rate is all over the place.

1392
01:49:14,429 --> 01:49:16,639
He is nervous. Who wouldn't be?

1393
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,767
The mountain is stable.

1394
01:49:19,309 --> 01:49:21,102
Everything is good.

1395
01:49:21,144 --> 01:49:23,605
The rate of ascent is within normal parameters.

1396
01:49:23,646 --> 01:49:24,939
400 meters.

1397
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:27,817
300 meters.

1398
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:34,449
Ignacio, what happened?

1399
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:37,160
The capsule is grafting the borehole and we lost biometrics.

1400
01:49:37,202 --> 01:49:38,328
There is a problem.

1401
01:49:42,832 --> 01:49:44,292
- Hey, hey!

1402
01:49:45,627 --> 01:49:47,796
We don't have a visual down there.

1403
01:49:52,175 --> 01:49:53,635
I'm gonna try and reverse it.

1404
01:49:53,677 --> 01:49:54,719
Don Lucho.

1405
01:49:55,303 --> 01:49:56,680
The capsule is stuck.

1406
01:49:57,055 --> 01:49:58,890
They're reversing the Phoenix.

1407
01:50:00,308 --> 01:50:01,685
What happened?

1408
01:50:05,855 --> 01:50:07,190
Here we go.

1409
01:50:10,193 --> 01:50:12,153
OK, beginning descent.

1410
01:50:14,197 --> 01:50:15,490
Is he breathing?

1411
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:18,326
We have no way of knowing what his oxygen supply is.

1412
01:50:24,332 --> 01:50:25,375
Hey.

1413
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,549
- Light up down there - Anything?

1414
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,096
I'm gonna try again.

1415
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:42,434
The wheel stopped.

1416
01:50:48,606 --> 01:50:50,275
It's moving.

1417
01:50:50,608 --> 01:50:51,776
The capsule is moving.

1418
01:50:55,572 --> 01:50:56,656
What happened?

1419
01:50:56,698 --> 01:50:58,199
We lost Alex.

1420
01:50:58,241 --> 01:50:59,909
They lost contact.

1421
01:51:33,777 --> 01:51:35,362
He made it?

1422
01:51:35,403 --> 01:51:36,946
He made it! Yes!

1423
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,615
Dad!  - Son

1424
01:51:58,551 --> 01:52:00,553
This is your baby girl.

1425
01:52:01,262 --> 01:52:02,889
Esperanza (Hope).

1426
01:52:02,931 --> 01:52:04,224
Oh man, a girl.

1427
01:52:16,736 --> 01:52:17,654
Mario.

1428
01:52:17,696 --> 01:52:18,905
Good luck, Mario.

1429
01:52:20,448 --> 01:52:21,616
See you soon.

1430
01:52:23,201 --> 01:52:24,661
Goodbye, huevones!

1431
01:52:25,078 --> 01:52:26,830
I love you!

1432
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,833
I love you!

1433
01:52:31,626 --> 01:52:33,795
Yeah baby!!! Come in!

1434
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:37,674
Ha ha ha! Coming Katty!

1435
01:52:42,262 --> 01:52:44,431
Minister. Finally I meet you.

1436
01:52:44,472 --> 01:52:46,433
Call me Laurence, Mario. Laurence

1437
01:52:58,319 --> 01:52:59,612
Mario! Over here!

1438
01:53:01,531 --> 01:53:03,366
Hey, my brothers, thank you!

1439
01:53:03,408 --> 01:53:05,410
Thank you for everything!

1440
01:53:09,164 --> 01:53:10,874
Let's go for a "Chi"!

1441
01:53:10,915 --> 01:53:16,500
Let's go for a "le"! Chi Chi Chi Le Le Le


01:53:17,515 --> 01:53:24,500
Over a billion people all over the world witness this miracle in the Atacama desert.

01:53:27,515 --> 01:53:33,500
After 69 days is going to be a very long night in the San Jose Mine. But nobody will go to sleep.

1442
01:53:47,327 --> 01:53:49,120
Thank you for everything you did for us!

1443
01:53:49,162 --> 01:53:51,039
Thank you for never giving up!

1444
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,333
I love you, Copiapo!

1445
01:54:02,092 --> 01:54:04,260
Yonni! Yonni!

1446
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:08,014
- Susi! - I love you!

1447
01:54:17,524 --> 01:54:18,983
Dario, Dario.

1448
01:54:36,209 --> 01:54:37,711
My sister Maria Segovia. Do you know her?

1449
01:54:37,752 --> 01:54:39,796
By there.

1450
01:54:44,801 --> 01:54:46,970
Dario! Dario!

1451
01:54:47,303 --> 01:54:48,303
