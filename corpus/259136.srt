00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,439
<i>We interrupt this program to bring you</i>
<i>a special news bulletin.</i>

2
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,779
<i>Ernest Strohbecker</i>
<i>and two accomplices...</i>

3
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:49,947
<i>... escaped from a maximum</i>- <i>security</i>
<i>ward in Bellevue Hospital last night...</i>

4
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:53,560
<i>... after brutally stabbing two nurses</i>
<i>and a custodian to death.</i>

5
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:57,289
<i>Strohbecker is extremely dangerous,</i>
<i>brutal and unpredict</i>...

6
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:59,160
Harry?

7
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:44,335
Harry?

8
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:51,845
Harry?

9
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:56,718
Harry!

10
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,631
He has the hots for you.

11
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,361
<i>For me? No.</i>

12
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,037
Cut. Brilliant.

13
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,608
Natasha!

14
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,921
Okay, I think we have
a little communication gap here.

15
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,257
When I said "more"...

16
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,298
...I didn't mean trash the fucking set.

17
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:39,605
This is not Chekhov. You're not
the star. You're just another victim.

18
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:45,735
You get stabbed. You die.

19
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:51,445
I want to see the pain.
I want to see the blood spurting.

20
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:57,157
Billy, where was the blood?
I want to see her bleed to death.

21
00:06:57,358 --> 00:07:00,122
Okay? Okay?

22
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:02,928
Let's do it again, folks!

23
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:30,155
You make the blood flow
by squeezing the bag with your elbow.

24
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,689
- Okay?
- Sure.

25
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:34,555
We're gonna be here till Christmas,
right?

26
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,522
Natasha!

27
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:41,766
Tell him you make the blood flow
by squeezing the bag with your elbow.

28
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:51,367
- Okay.
- Tell her...

29
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:54,013
...that he will get it right next time.

30
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:56,239
She heard you.

31
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:59,409
Y'all keep forgetting
she can hear you perfectly well.

32
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,086
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- <i>It's okay.</i>

33
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,552
Okay, from the top.

34
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,055
Stop. Stop. Stop!

35
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:12,859
What's the holdup?

36
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,710
What is he saying?

37
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:30,009
He says he's awfully sorry, but he
needs at least a day to redress the set.

38
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,879
A day?

39
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:40,587
Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of
the corpse, and that'll wrap it for today.

40
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,396
All right. Okay.

41
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:50,197
So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a
slow zoom into the puddle of blood...

42
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,613
Billy.

43
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:15,223
Madame Olga wants some sugar
in her blood again.

44
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:34,480
<i>Thank you.</i>

45
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:45,892
So, he's kind of cute.

46
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:51,089
Three months in Moscow,
cold winter nights...

47
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:54,196
Just a thought.

48
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,261
Billy, that's what Mom would say.

49
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,707
Hi.

50
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,855
He says use more white
like a real dead body.

51
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:06,996
Okay, Boris, get everyone ready.

52
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,537
Out of frame, Billy.

53
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:21,552
What is going on now?

54
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,050
Andy. Sorry, 6:00.

55
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,988
- One more shot!
- We have no time.

56
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:29,219
One shot! I can't believe this.

57
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,013
She needs to go get Strohbecker's face.

58
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,915
Right! His dummy falls off
the balcony on Monday.

59
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,454
We'll wait here for you.

60
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:59,421
Karen, she's got her own car.

61
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:03,556
Okay. Okay. Don't forget tonight.

62
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:05,823
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta!

63
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm making my famous chili con Clarke.

64
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,529
Alex, what do you say? You coming?

65
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:15,106
Sorry. I have tickets
for the Bolshoi Ballet tonight.

66
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,937
Well, try and stay awake.

67
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:57,041
Yeah!

68
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,844
Damn.

69
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,587
Honey! Honey, can you get that?

70
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,630
Honey!

71
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,962
I'm in the shower!

72
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:28,072
Hello?

73
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,972
Hello?

74
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:40,243
Hello?

75
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,315
<i>Hello?</i>

76
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,647
Didn't it even cross your mind?
It could've been Billy.

77
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,341
I was thinking about dinner.

78
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,279
I'm still thinking about dinner.

79
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:18,953
She's not there either. Shit.

80
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:21,018
Okay.

81
00:16:57,524 --> 00:17:00,550
Hello, Billy! Thank God. She's there.

82
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,389
- Are you all right?
- Ask her about the mask.

83
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,192
You want to tap something through?

84
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,134
Wait. Wait.

85
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,031
- Oh, man!
- A...

86
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,098
- Oh, man!
...O...

87
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:18,538
- Man!
...L?

88
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:22,112
- Oh, man.
- Was it L? The second letter, was it L?

89
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,045
Shit!

90
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,776
A-L-L?

91
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:30,352
O-K.

92
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,286
- We're eating out tonight.
- Okay.

93
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,654
So are you coming over now?

94
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,961
<i>Do you have the mask?</i>

95
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:41,862
Well, don't worry. Just get over here.

96
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,366
You hungry?

97
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,901
Bye.

98
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,483
Stop. Stop. Stop.

99
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,557
Hey.

100
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,379
Hello?

101
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,684
Is anyone there?

102
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:37,596
I can explain.

103
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,704
Hello?

104
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:31,888
Billy!

105
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,058
Wait. I explain.

106
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:45,298
Lyosh! Lyosh!

107
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:38,385
Hello!

108
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,253
Hello? Is anybody there?

109
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:47,225
- Come here, quickly!
- Oh, my God, Billy.

110
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:49,928
Quickly!

111
00:33:52,104 --> 00:33:53,833
- What happened?
- I don't know.

112
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,703
She slipped and fall bad. Poor Billy.

113
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,569
Andy, she's at the back!

114
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:03,612
Get the doctor, quickly.

115
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,147
You go. I'll stay here with her.

116
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,078
- Let go of her.
- No, I must hold her. She must not move.

117
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,589
Danger she'll never walk again
if she move.

118
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:17,124
- Go!
- Yeah, okay.

119
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:19,793
Andy!

120
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,861
Billy!

121
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:23,729
Billy, you mustn't move.

122
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,166
You may become paralyzed.
It's dangerous.

123
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:30,604
Don't worry. I'll be right back. I promise.

124
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,143
Andy!

125
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,695
What's going on?

126
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:55,264
Andy, go with the janitor
and fetch an ambulance!

127
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,334
- Billy's had an accident.
- What?

128
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:02,135
Don't just stand there! Do it now!

129
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,634
Ambulance!

130
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,135
Come on!

131
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:11,282
It's all right, sweetie. I'm here now,
and an ambulance is on its way.

132
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:14,511
Let go of her.
She's trying to say something.

133
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:18,856
Police?

134
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:21,552
Murder?

135
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:28,164
Andy! Andy!

136
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:59,462
Excuse me. It's true.
We just fake murder.

137
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,330
If we really want to murder,
why make film of it?

138
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,470
We're not stupid, really.

139
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,177
No, no. Sorry.

140
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,077
We understand how she feel.

141
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:22,220
She think she see
a real murder and panic.

142
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:25,915
Where did you see the murder from?

143
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:32,893
And it was this man?

144
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:40,933
But you say here, "He wore a stocking
pulled over his head.

145
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:47,007
And then they chased me through
the building and try to kill me as well."

146
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,713
Guys! Guys. English, please.

147
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:04,285
We make test for you.

148
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,921
For your film.

149
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,330
We try make blood much big.

150
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:14,232
<i>He's lying!</i>

151
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,432
Sorry, Billy. We not tell you.

152
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:21,135
Keep secret not to hurt your feelings.

153
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:23,907
- I would've let you done tests.
- Andy.

154
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:27,850
What I mean is...

155
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:31,323
Let's see their film.
I'll know if it's real.

156
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:32,922
You're right.

157
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:45,670
Wait. Stop!

158
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:48,803
He could expose the film.

159
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,706
Let her do it. Please.

160
00:37:55,948 --> 00:38:00,180
This lets you unload the film
without needing a darkroom.

161
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:01,648
I see.

162
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,187
God, it's hot in here.

163
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:10,590
If he had exposed the film to the light, he
could have destroyed all the evidence.

164
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:18,661
Actually, I haven't done this
since film school.

165
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,798
Right. It's safe in the can now.

166
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:27,206
Here. Take it to the lab immediately
for developing.

167
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:29,048
It's okay.

168
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:29,878
It's okay.

169
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,981
Murder weapon? Where?

170
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:01,270
Stop. Stop. Stop!

171
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:04,846
- I'm...
- What?

172
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:09,080
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You...

173
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,848
Oh, my God!

174
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:38,640
- Tastes sweet.
- It's for the actors.

175
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:41,081
They put the stuff in their mouths.

176
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,883
- What she say?
- That it's her knife.

177
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:48,582
They broke into her box
and used the blood.

178
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:51,490
So now she say it was a trick.

179
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:55,496
It happened so fast
she couldn't see the knife clearly.

180
00:39:55,701 --> 00:40:00,001
But everything else
she saw tonight was clear?

181
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:04,271
The body in the elevator shaft.
She saw that.

182
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:19,477
- What?
- What? What?

183
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,982
Sweet.

184
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:24,979
- It is fake blood.
- It's fake blood.

185
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:28,923
They could have soaked the sheets
in fake blood afterwards.

186
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:32,425
But where is the body?

187
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:37,325
Here you say, "A head cut off."

188
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,444
Wait. Wait.

189
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,607
She says...

190
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:54,342
Well, there were more bags
in there before.

191
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:57,953
No, she's right.

192
00:41:59,258 --> 00:42:01,351
I will show you.

193
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:09,428
From lift shaft
we take the rubbish here.

194
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,868
Fast. Easy.

195
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,231
Hey, we need that.

196
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,833
Sorry, I can do nothing for you now.

197
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,878
But I will call you
after I see the film. Okay?

198
00:42:56,315 --> 00:42:58,078
Sorry.

199
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:29,645
Well, I've never been more
embarrassed in my entire life.

200
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:35,848
I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro.

201
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:39,184
She'd know the difference
between a real murder and a gag.

202
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:41,622
Please, has she even seen
a real murder?

203
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:43,226
That's my point.

204
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:48,055
If what she saw tonight was real,
then she has seen the difference, right?

205
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:52,397
Oh, come on. We all bought the guy
cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it.

206
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:54,505
Because you're a wuss.

207
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:57,933
I'm gonna let that slide.

208
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:05,476
No offence, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot
the stuff today using that guy's knife.

209
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:07,175
It was her knife. God!

210
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:09,452
Whatever. It looked good.

211
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:12,079
Shut up.

212
00:44:50,095 --> 00:44:51,858
Buka!

213
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,112
Buka?

214
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:14,768
Buka.

215
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,473
Buka.

216
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:37,725
Please, Billy, take some of mine.
You'll feel better.

217
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,997
Okay.

218
00:47:05,764 --> 00:47:08,130
Could you pass me the salt, please?

219
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:17,169
You could at least make the effort.

220
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:24,139
Listen...

221
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:29,683
...l'm sorry. All I can think about now is
the movie, but as soon as we get back...

222
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:33,552
...I promise, I'll learn.
- How often have I heard that?

223
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,790
Come on. I can understand
some of what she's saying.

224
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:39,453
What?

225
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:44,265
Okay, how about this?

226
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:47,294
- Means "makeup," right?
- Wrong.

227
00:47:47,472 --> 00:47:50,566
It means somebody's look,
the expression on their face.

228
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,539
- That was close.
- Billy said...

229
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:55,612
...she'll never forget the look
on the girl's face...

230
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:58,408
...from the moment she knew
she was gonna die.

231
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:01,245
She said the pain
and the terror was real.

232
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,684
You can't act that.

233
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:20,395
Come closer, Mr. Hausmann.
I won't bite.

234
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:26,762
- Did it go smoothly?
- About the money...

235
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:32,035
- Did it go smoothly?
- Yes, of course. No problem.

236
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,139
Did it go smoothly, Mr. Hausmann?

237
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:46,714
- We did our job. The condition was...
- That everything would go smoothly.

238
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:49,417
Yes. Yes, and we have your diskette.

239
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:52,687
And who informed the police?

240
00:49:53,098 --> 00:49:58,536
American girl say something,
but nobody believe her.

241
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:03,874
As long as there are witnesses,
there's no money.

242
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:06,208
You mean...?

243
00:50:07,746 --> 00:50:11,807
I think we understand each other,
Mr. Hausmann.

244
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:06,366
You can come back to our place, and
we'll set up the couch if you want.

245
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:13,767
You're not on one of your "I'll show her
how independent I am" kicks, are you?

246
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:18,314
Honey, you coming or what?

247
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:25,381
- Andy, don't you care about her?
- I don't care? I don't care?

248
00:51:25,824 --> 00:51:28,918
Fine. I'm calling the American
Embassy tonight, okay?

249
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,788
- It's the weekend. They're closed.
- Not for us.

250
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:36,297
My dad gave me the duty officer's
number before we left, just in case.

251
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,699
So say goodbye.

252
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:55,376
Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers
who answered the complaint.

253
00:51:55,553 --> 00:51:57,316
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

254
00:51:57,722 --> 00:52:00,782
Please speak English
to the ambassador's secretary.

255
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:03,960
My chief asked me
to meet Mr. Lovett here.

256
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:08,121
If this witness is correct about
what she saw tonight...

257
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:10,324
...she may help my investigation.

258
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:14,837
- Your English is good, Mr. Larsen.
- My mother was a translator.

259
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,373
- In the university?
- No. KGB.

260
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,984
Please.

261
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:32,720
We've been tracking
gangsters in Moscow...

262
00:52:32,891 --> 00:52:36,725
...running an international
pornography and prostitution racket.

263
00:52:36,895 --> 00:52:41,229
Sit down, please. We have information
they have made snuff films here...

264
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:44,596
...and sold them all over the world.

265
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:47,736
Snuff film. Is that what I think it is?

266
00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:50,739
Victims believe they are
making a sex film...

267
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:54,345
...but they are murdered
in front of the camera.

268
00:52:54,512 --> 00:52:58,039
What is the name of the witness?
What is it?

269
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:01,117
- Billy Hughes, sir.
- Billy Hughes. Yes.

270
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:04,687
She claims to have seen
one being made.

271
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:10,459
The victims are illegal immigrants
exploited as prostitutes by a gang...

272
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:13,062
...headed by one man.

273
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,932
He is brutal, ruthless.

274
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:21,403
They call him The Reaper.

275
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:28,375
I'm surprised his men gave
up the film so easily.

276
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:33,410
If it is what I think it is...

277
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:38,147
...our witness, Billy Hughes,
is in great danger.

278
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,694
<i>Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.</i>

279
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:28,269
<i>Hello.</i>

280
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,943
<i>Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.</i>

281
00:54:37,348 --> 00:54:38,838
<i>Hello.</i>

282
00:55:00,038 --> 00:55:00,104
Have you seen, how do you say,
snuff film before?

283
00:55:00,104 --> 00:55:05,041
Have you seen, how do you say,
snuff film before?

284
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,101
I saw a woman tied to a tree...

285
00:55:09,113 --> 00:55:14,745
...kept alive while her arms
and legs were cut off.

286
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,516
It's hard to talk about it...

287
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:22,720
...or even think about it.

288
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:28,890
And it makes you sick to watch it.

289
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:35,734
You never forget the look
in the victim's eyes.

290
00:55:36,341 --> 00:55:39,242
The sheer panic and horror...

291
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:44,006
...when they realize
they're about to die.

292
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:57,814
Yes, sir.

293
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:59,149
No, sir.

294
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:02,149
Right.

295
00:57:02,493 --> 00:57:04,120
Right.

296
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,655
Right, sir. Right, sir.

297
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:13,793
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. I appreciate
the call. I'll give Dad your best. Right.

298
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:15,537
Well?

299
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:18,774
I told you.
There's nothing to worry about.

300
00:57:18,943 --> 00:57:22,435
He says the film's the biggest
piece of shit he's ever seen.

301
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:36,607
<i>Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.</i>

302
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:39,483
Hi, Billy. It's Karen.

303
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:44,883
I hope you weren't sleeping. I just
wanted to check and see if you're okay.

304
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:52,654
<i>I am fine. No need to worry.</i>
<i>Did you call earlier?</i>

305
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:57,426
No, I got straight through.
You sure you're okay?

306
01:00:04,008 --> 01:00:09,947
<i>Sure. Had bath. All fine.</i>
<i>Now I go to bed. You too.</i>

307
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:13,208
I just wanted to tell you...

308
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:16,716
...they saw the film,
and it's not the real thing.

309
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,480
<i>That's good. Right?</i>

310
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:22,283
Did I hear something there?

311
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:28,896
<i>Doorbell. Wait. I'll see who.</i>

312
01:00:29,066 --> 01:00:32,797
<i>What? It's almost 1:00.</i>

313
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:36,872
<i>I wouldn't get that, Billy. Billy?</i>

314
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:40,736
Billy? You be careful, now.

315
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:42,435
Check who it is first.

316
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:13,041
Please. I want to talk.

317
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:19,716
- Billy! Billy, are you still there?
- Would you leave her alone?

318
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,751
I heard a noise, Andy.
Something's happened. I swear.

319
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,401
Billy!

320
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:51,915
Okay, that's it. I'm going there.

321
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:53,644
What?

322
01:02:05,663 --> 01:02:08,598
<i>Karen, help. Call police. Emergency.</i>

323
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,450
<i>Hello?</i>

324
01:02:29,654 --> 01:02:32,145
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Police, emergency.</i>

325
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:35,481
<i>Police?</i>

326
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:38,325
<i>Yes.</i>

327
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:41,759
Da.

328
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,599
<i>Hello, my name is Billy Hughes.</i>

329
01:02:45,836 --> 01:02:51,331
<i>My address is apartment 923</i>- <i>126...</i>

330
01:02:51,509 --> 01:02:54,103
<i>... Kievsky prospekt.</i>

331
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:57,610
<i>Telephone 920</i>- <i>5...</i>

332
01:03:03,387 --> 01:03:04,684
<i>Billy Hughes speaking.</i>

333
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:08,552
<i>This is a digital voice computer.</i>

334
01:03:08,726 --> 01:03:13,720
- <i>Please have patience and I will answer.</i>
- <i>Hello? You English?</i>

335
01:03:13,898 --> 01:03:15,695
<i>My name is Billy Hughes.</i>

336
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:18,630
<i>Yes? What do you want, please?</i>

337
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,301
<i>Hello?</i>

338
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:23,367
<i>Help. Intruder.</i>

339
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:26,633
<i>I no understand. Sorry.</i>

340
01:03:32,249 --> 01:03:34,547
<i>Bad man want to kill me.</i>

341
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,655
<i>Bad man?</i>
<i>I get man who speak English, yes?</i>

342
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,545
<i>Hello? Hello? I speak English.</i>

343
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,847
<i>Are you okay?</i>

344
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:17,460
<i>If you just give your address,</i>
<i>we send somebody immediately.</i>

345
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:19,151
<i>Hello?</i>

346
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:07,529
Where's the diskette?

347
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:14,127
Where is the diskette?

348
01:07:20,044 --> 01:07:23,036
I know you have!

349
01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:46,833
My name is Alexander Larsen.
I'm a policeman. Take your clothes.

350
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:49,268
We must get out of here.

351
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,366
You must hurry.

352
01:07:56,747 --> 01:07:59,978
I explain everything in the car.

353
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:04,012
In the car. No time now.

354
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:25,535
They are coming.

355
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:29,912
We are in great danger.

356
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,388
Quick.

357
01:09:57,901 --> 01:09:59,630
It's not over yet.

358
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:11,210
- My...
- Oh, my God, it's trashed!

359
01:10:13,217 --> 01:10:14,775
Billy, where are you?

360
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,283
I'll call the police!

361
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,122
Billy. Oh, Billy. Oh, my God.

362
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:24,291
How do you work this thing?

363
01:10:25,963 --> 01:10:28,591
Oh, there it is.

364
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:38,404
Someone's dead in the ba...

365
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:44,342
God! Oh, my God!

366
01:10:44,548 --> 01:10:46,607
- Get the door!
- Get a chair!

367
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,411
- Get the chair!
- What chair?

368
01:10:48,585 --> 01:10:51,918
- The chair!
- Out of the way! Move!

369
01:10:52,089 --> 01:10:54,853
- Put it over there!
- Move! Get the wardrobe over!

370
01:10:55,058 --> 01:10:56,753
- Andy, quick!
- Push it!

371
01:10:56,927 --> 01:11:01,455
I'm pushing! Get out of the way!
What are you doing?

372
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,497
I can't. Oh, my God!

373
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,759
- I can't. I can't! You hold the door!
- Get out of the way!

374
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:09,804
- Come here! Andy! Come here!
- Don't yell at me!

375
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:14,273
I'm trying to get the goddamn wardrobe
near the fucking door!

376
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:20,174
Oh, my God!

377
01:11:35,732 --> 01:11:38,292
The girl you saw murdered tonight...

378
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:42,199
...her boyfriend stole a diskette
full of information.

379
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:46,900
Money, names, connections, everything.
He blackmailed The Reaper.

380
01:11:47,411 --> 01:11:52,144
Very dangerous. And now he thinks
that you have the diskette.

381
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:54,114
<i>Me?</i>

382
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:57,549
You have it?

383
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:15,831
We don't have any diskettes.

384
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:25,014
Not that one. That's my script.

385
01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:44,367
The girl had it when
she went into the studio.

386
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:46,968
Then she was murdered,
and it was gone.

387
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,467
Where is it?

388
01:12:49,306 --> 01:12:52,173
Think. You were the only person there.

389
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:15,397
Think.

390
01:13:27,978 --> 01:13:29,912
Write. Write it.

391
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:43,954
Write it.

392
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:49,822
Quick, write.

393
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:56,632
Police? Yes. Yes,
but only with the diskette.

394
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,873
<i>Why?</i>

395
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:07,449
You know, I work undercover.
The Reaper thinks I work for him.

396
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:10,745
Trust me. Trust me.

397
01:14:20,197 --> 01:14:21,789
Crazy!

398
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:39,281
They'll kill you!

399
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:50,150
Get in!

400
01:15:52,155 --> 01:15:54,214
Get in!

401
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:05,862
Please, give me the keys.

402
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:12,438
Write. Where is the diskette?

403
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,472
We cannot escape in this car.

404
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:19,347
Write. Write.

405
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:28,682
Studio. Where in the studio?

406
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:34,698
Delta three. Delta three.

407
01:16:34,698 --> 01:16:37,098
Delta three. Delta three.

408
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:53,576
What?

409
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:56,614
What?

410
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,287
This is all
a big misunderstanding and...

411
01:17:01,424 --> 01:17:05,053
Excuse me, but this is...

412
01:17:06,062 --> 01:17:08,622
You don't have to arrest us.
Why is he arresting me?

413
01:17:08,865 --> 01:17:11,095
This is ridiculous.
I'm an American citizen.

414
01:17:11,368 --> 01:17:14,201
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm a director.

415
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:17,807
I'm directing a movie here.
I'm bringing a lot of money in.

416
01:17:18,074 --> 01:17:23,137
And my father, okay, he knows
a lot of big people, and... Listen.

417
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:25,506
You want money?
Is that what you want?

418
01:17:25,749 --> 01:17:29,412
I don't understand what is going on here.
We don't have a diskette!

419
01:17:29,586 --> 01:17:33,113
You have one more chance
to tell me where is diskette.

420
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:39,325
The diskette.
You know, I mean, this is ridiculous.

421
01:17:39,596 --> 01:17:42,087
We don't have a diskette.
That's what I'm saying.

422
01:18:01,484 --> 01:18:04,044
Karen, get the key!
Get the key! Unlock me!

423
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:09,821
<i>Find the key!</i>

424
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:17,965
- <i>He's not gonna move, is he?</i>
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

425
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,600
- <i>Delta three. Delta three.</i>
- Let's get out of here.

426
01:18:25,308 --> 01:18:27,868
- Answer it.
- Why?

427
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:31,275
They may say something about Billy.

428
01:18:31,448 --> 01:18:33,279
<i>Delta three.</i>

429
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,628
I got something
about studio. Come on.

430
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:54,496
Look out!

431
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:12,984
It's not what you think.

432
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:17,752
What do you say...? How do you...?
In Russian, what...?

433
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,095
What? What does that mean?

434
01:19:22,265 --> 01:19:25,894
- Hel...
- Hello? We need help!

435
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:31,539
I'm a director, and I'm making
a movie here. This is not a movie.

436
01:19:33,743 --> 01:19:36,371
Put the gun away.
You look like a hit man.

437
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:40,116
- He thinks we're gonna kill him!
- We're not gonna kill you!

438
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:45,414
- This is not even ours!
- The policemen wanted to kill us!

439
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:49,690
- We gotta get out of here.
- I think we should call the cops.

440
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:52,089
- Are you crazy?
- Well, we can explain this.

441
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:58,358
Explain? You are crazy.
Come on. Here.

442
01:19:58,535 --> 01:20:01,299
I'll take these too.

443
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:15,214
And now?

444
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:17,911
Child locks.

445
01:20:34,571 --> 01:20:38,337
Don't look now,
but our friends are still here.

446
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:54,517
I will block the other entrances.

447
01:21:01,464 --> 01:21:04,456
What are you doing?
That's Red Square.

448
01:21:06,302 --> 01:21:07,599
Oh, perfect.

449
01:22:11,568 --> 01:22:15,004
This damn gun, I can't work the safety.

450
01:22:18,842 --> 01:22:20,537
Holy shit!

451
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,871
Around the back.

452
01:22:47,604 --> 01:22:49,936
- Okay. Jump, Andy. I got you.
- What?

453
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,470
I got you. I got you.

454
01:23:27,744 --> 01:23:30,235
It's no use. All lines are cut.

455
01:23:31,247 --> 01:23:33,112
Where is it?

456
01:23:52,602 --> 01:23:55,969
You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you.

457
01:23:56,606 --> 01:23:58,733
The Reaper wants to meet the woman...

458
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:04,244
...who has kept him up all night
and witnessed a live snuff.

459
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,905
He wants you to do it.

460
01:24:08,618 --> 01:24:11,815
You know why we call him The Reaper?

461
01:24:11,988 --> 01:24:14,286
You see his face, you die.

462
01:24:51,427 --> 01:24:53,793
Nice night, isn't it?

463
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:56,931
I'm just taking a piss.

464
01:24:58,401 --> 01:25:00,801
Right, you know, just...

465
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,021
Who the hell is that?

466
01:25:25,194 --> 01:25:28,925
Well, whoever it is,
they're coming here.

467
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:51,215
- I can't work the safety.
- Andy, come on.

468
01:25:51,421 --> 01:25:52,786
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

469
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:58,259
Hurry!

470
01:26:06,269 --> 01:26:07,896
Where is she, Larsen?

471
01:26:11,674 --> 01:26:14,268
- <i>Larsen, are you reading me?</i>
- Somebody's coming.

472
01:26:14,477 --> 01:26:16,604
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

473
01:26:16,779 --> 01:26:19,077
I'm bringing her out now.

474
01:26:22,752 --> 01:26:25,983
- Shoot him. Shoot him, Andy.
- Okay.

475
01:26:30,493 --> 01:26:33,553
Be careful of Billy! God.

476
01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:54,910
Billy!

477
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:04,724
Stay where you are!

478
01:27:07,296 --> 01:27:10,026
Run, Billy. Run! Run!

479
01:27:11,868 --> 01:27:13,301
Stand back!

480
01:27:13,503 --> 01:27:15,471
Not out there!

481
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:26,481
Kill her, Larsen.

482
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,659
No!

483
01:29:01,744 --> 01:29:04,907
Now please, let me explain.

484
01:29:05,314 --> 01:29:09,011
- Please?
- Explain?

485
01:29:19,929 --> 01:29:21,521
Karen!

486
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,462
Will you...?

487
01:29:31,807 --> 01:29:33,934
Kill him.

488
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:08,275
You genius!

489
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:16,785
You thought we were tourists, huh?
Guess again, pal.

490
01:30:17,853 --> 01:30:19,650
Don't move.

491
01:30:19,855 --> 01:30:22,881
Don't move! I'm talking to you!

492
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:28,586
I'm warning you.
Don't move or I'm gonna shoot you!

493
01:30:28,864 --> 01:30:31,833
Okay, one more step! All right.

494
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:43,006
- Billy! Billy! Billy!
- She's okay. She's fine.

495
01:30:43,179 --> 01:30:44,441
She's okay?

496
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:46,012
<i>I'm fine.</i>

497
01:30:50,686 --> 01:30:52,415
A cop?

498
01:30:52,888 --> 01:30:54,583
A cop?

499
01:30:54,757 --> 01:30:58,056
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

500
01:30:58,227 --> 01:31:01,594
Forget it. Your sister was brilliant.

501
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,890
Next time, hit back.

502
01:31:08,471 --> 01:31:10,735
Oh, this is the remote.

503
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,606
- I get it.
- Big cowboy.

504
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:18,808
What?

505
01:31:18,981 --> 01:31:22,212
That was an invitation
to dinner sometime.

506
01:31:22,385 --> 01:31:25,377
How you say...?
It would be a pleasure.

507
01:31:25,588 --> 01:31:29,422
<i>Pleasure?</i>
<i>My pleasure.</i>

508
01:31:33,896 --> 01:31:36,660
- I still don't understand.
- What?

509
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:39,999
I don't understand...

510
01:31:40,169 --> 01:31:44,299
...why The Reaper didn't take
the diskette off me.

511
01:31:44,473 --> 01:31:45,804
Who?

512
01:31:50,813 --> 01:31:52,804
Shit. I'm sorry.

513
01:31:56,452 --> 01:31:58,317
Big cowboy.

514
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:21,607
Billy, tomorrow!

515
01:32:22,778 --> 01:32:24,609
Tomorrow!

516
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:27,813
What's the matter?

517
01:32:29,151 --> 01:32:30,448
Big cowboy.

518
01:32:30,653 --> 01:32:33,986
Guys, could we get out of here, please?

519
01:32:35,124 --> 01:32:36,489
The expression?

520
01:32:38,994 --> 01:32:40,962
The car?

521
01:32:43,966 --> 01:32:45,934
The car...

522
01:32:50,873 --> 01:32:54,969
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!
