-Yeah.

108
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,610
Well, they've been watching
"Mod Squad" reruns back to back.

109
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,079
-And speaking of mediocre
TV, look who's here.

Maurice, I'm honored.

114
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,360
I was sure I would
get a call saying

115
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,929
you were in Aspen
skiing with Tom Cruise.

116
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,499

miss this for the world.

-You wanted to meet
actors, they're all here.

Every gumba hit man,
Jew lawyer, Irish mug

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,479
you have ever seen on TV.

124
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:44,251
This is an elephant graveyard
of faces you cannot name.

125
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,219
-Wow, thanks for the
stereotyping, Maurice.

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,956
Glad you don't fit into
any pigeonhole yourself.

127
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,558
You still driving
a black Beamer?

128
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,229
-Touche, you son of a bitch.

129
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,931
-Oh, and speaking
of stereotypes,

130
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,734
you know Steve, and
Armand, and Dorian?

-Dorian.

134
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,938
I saw that bit you did
in the Pacino film.

135
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:05,939
-Oh, yeah?
-Saw the rough cut.

136
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:06,740

Oh, thank you.

00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,677
Thanks very much.

-Oh, that was you ?

141
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,379

I'm Dorian.

145
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:14,648
CATRICE: Dorian.

146
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,883
-Look.

147
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,017
Is that flirting?

148
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,687
-I've seen you somewhere
recently, haven't I?

149
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:20,654
-Theater?

150
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,989
-I mean, is he
flirting right now

151
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,324
or is he just being cordial?

152
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,026
-Yeah.

153
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,462
-I'd say he's just
sucking up to a producer

154
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,964
by any means necessary.

155
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,501
-You know, Sam, I really can't
tell because being married

156
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,404
to Steve has sandpapered
the flirt right out of me.

157
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,810
-So where's your father?

158
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,877
-Oh, yeah, my dad.

159
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,678
Oh, yeah.

160
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,647
Hey, Pop?

161
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,949
Pop, look who's here,
Maurice Melnick.

162
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:49,917
-Who?

163
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,719
-Maurice Melnick, the producer.

164
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,387
Remember, he used
you on his TV show?

165
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,988
You played the old
man on a stoop.

166
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:55,789
-Soup?

167
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,226
I didn't order any soup.

168
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,628
JOHNNY: Like you said,
he's one of a kind.

169
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,595
Help yourselves.

170
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,396
-Dorian.

171
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,196
Catrice.

172
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,765
-Did you hear that?

173
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,500
He saw me in a rough cut.

174
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,468
I got to call my agent.

175
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,402
-What are you talking about?

176
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,670
You had two lines in that movie.

177
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,571
-It was a pivotal scene.

178
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,705
The plot turned on it.

179
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,374
-Oh, the plotted turned
on, "I'm sorry Mr. Lee.

180
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,009
I can't give you
that information."

181
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,177
-How do you know that?

182
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,646
-I was up for the
same part, remember?

183
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,447
-Oh, that's right.

184
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,681
I forgot.

185
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,283
You would have been good.

186
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,217
-Look at him.

187
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,223
I've auditioned
for him five times.

188
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,324
Twice I had callbacks.

189
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,261
He looked at me like he
didn't even remember me.

190
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,696
-What's that?

191
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,830
What's that thing you're doing?

192
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,065
That's an Italian thing,
biting your knuckles.

193
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,232
Jews don't bite their knuckles.

194
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,435
Jews slap their foreheads.

195
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,270
-Well, thank you
for the tip, Dorian.

196
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,672
But I am allowed to
do Italian things, OK?

197
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,473
-I'm trying to help you.

198
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,807
-I'm married to an Italian.

199
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,308
-Hey, hey, at least
you read for him.

200
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,777
He looked at me
like I was a valet.

201
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,345
I'm surprised he didn't
throw me his keys.

202
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,553
-Oh, screw him.

203
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,754
Screw him.

204
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,723
Everything he touches
is schlock anyway.

205
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,891
-Yeah. we don't do schlock.

206
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:04,825
-That's right.

207
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,859
-Do you believe
that Maurice came?

208
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,094
This is incredible.

209
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,062
This means I got a real
shot at that Paramount part.

210
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,163
They still haven't
made a choice.

211
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:10,864
-John.

212
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:11,699
Johnny, take it easy.

213
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,533
You know he came for the food.

214
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,734
He's the cheapest guy in town.

215
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,639
-Yeah.

216
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,407
You know they say that he
stole an entire wheel of brie

217
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,142
from Spielberg's house?

218
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,511
-He's the one who
stole Spielberg's brie?

219
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,912
-Absolutely, it's him.

220
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,013
-Come on.

221
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,815
All I know, he's here
and I can't be bad.

222
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,550
We're talking about
a featured part

223
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,818
here with some real dimension.
-Really?

224
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,952
What is it this time?

225
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,854
Cab driver or plumber?

226
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,023
What, you going to stretch
and go for the hit man, huh?

227
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,124
-Come on, Armand.
I'm serious.

228
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:37,925
It's a lawyer.

229
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:38,959
All right, a corrupt lawyer.

230
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,060
But this character
has got some depth,

231
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,762
complexities, intelligence.

232
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,763
Oh, Armand.

233
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,298
Maybe this is my lucky day.

234
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,266
Oh, look who's here.

235
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,067
Theresa.

236
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,368
Theresa.

237
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,803
-Johnny.

238
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,238
Hello, my baby.

239
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,172
-Look at you, sweetheart.

240
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,306
Oh, the party's complete.

241
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,307
You look great.

242
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,576
It's like the old
days [inaudible].

243
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,678
-Hey, it's Theresa.

244
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,513
-Hey, Armand.

245
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,914
Your ex is here.

246
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,116
She came to LA for
the palimony suit.

247
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,184
-Hello.

248
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,153
JOHNNY: This is great,
Theresa shows up.

249
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,220
-You didn't even give me a call.

250
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,656
-No, I was going to.

251
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,191
I was going to, but I'm
just here for a couple days.

252
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,025
-You look great.

253
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,326
Hey, come on over.

254
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,261
I'll cook you a meal.

255
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,428
Some fettuccine alfredo?

256
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,396
-Oh, come on.

257
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,197
Don't tempt me.

258
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,666
-Oh, you can get away.

259
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:19,633
-Hey, Theresa.

260
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,734
-Hi.
-Give me my boyfriend back.

261
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,369
You had your chance with
him a long time ago.

262
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,871
-Yolanda, how have you been?

263
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:24,972
-I'm great.

264
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,506
-Hello.

265
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,041
-Oh my god.

266
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,476
-Hi, pal.

267
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:30,678
[interposing voices]

268
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:31,478
-Everybody.

269
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,947
[interposing voices]

270
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,416
[applause]

271
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,854
-I'm going to finally
have a real moment.

272
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,324
20 years of acting, I'm
going to have a real moment.

273
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,559
-Thank you, everybody.

274
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,594
Thank you very much.

275
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,928
We're just thrilled
you could be here

276
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,663
with us on this special day.

277
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,765
And remember, in
lieu of gifts, we're

278
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,034
asking you to make a donation
to the Los Ninos Mission.

279
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,435
-It wasn't my idea.

280
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,637
[laughter]

281
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,305
-As you know, they
do great work with

282
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,207
the disadvantaged children.

283
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,576
And, oh, I just want
to say, thank you.

284
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,677
We love you all.

285
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,477
-Aw.

286
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,913
-Aw.

287
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,347
[applause]

288
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,348
-What can I say?

289
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,750
I mean, if it weren't
for Hannah here,

290
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,820
I wouldn't be with great family
and friends giving away gifts

291
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,789
to strange children who will one
day grow up and try to rob me.

292
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,665
The truth is, I'm the
luckiest guy on Earth.

293
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,567
[applause]

294
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,751
-Well, I don't know why
political correctness

295
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,952
has crept into casting.

296
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,954
You can't even say like,
I want a fat guy anymore.

297
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,421
It's got to be like,
I want a large person.

298
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,389
Big human being.

299
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,791
You know, big, expansive.

300
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,493
But you just can't say, I need a
fat guy who's 6 foot 10, right?

301
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,271
-Oh, I hope we're
like Hannah and Johnny

302
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,272
on our 15th anniversary.

303
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,073
Don't you?

304
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:09,910
-Sure, babe.

305
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,352
-Make love to me tonight.

306
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,353
Will you, honey?

307
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,822
-What's the matter, baby.

308
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,824
You seem so sad.

309
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,793
-I'm not sad.

310
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,460
Just make love to me tonight.

311
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,261
Will you?

312
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,500
-This is what I'm talking about.

313
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,634
We have these opportunities.

314
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,770
Every once in a while,
you got to crack them.

315
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,038
Speak to him.

316
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:38,471
-I know.

317
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,272
I know.

318
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,440
I should be more assertive.

319
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,309
-And I said, no, no, no, no, no.

320
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,978
It's not the Woody Allen film.

321
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,614
So anyway, then he died.

322
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:48,716
-You should.

323
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,617
I talked to him when
he came in, so just go.

324
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:51,785
-I can't.
You go first.

325
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:52,585
-What?

326
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,453
What's the matter?

327
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,654
-Because I can't.

328
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,823
I feel bloated.

329
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,091
I ate chocolate.

330
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,127
-Honey, will you
listen to yourself?

331
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,461
Listen to us.

332
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,329
We're acting ridiculous.

333
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,130
Let's just go.

334
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,464
We're like normal people.

335
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,935
-Let me hold your arm.

336
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,469
-Can you tell my
shirt is ripped?

337
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,138
-No, just hold your arm down.

338
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,239
I'll hold it.

339
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,675
-Would you like a cup
of coffee, Maurice?

340
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,543
-Pretty please?

341
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,411
-You got it.

342
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,347
-This is like two coupling.

343
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,481
Let me-- let me just--

344
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:35,628
-We are a-- Maurice,
um-- really thought, um,

345
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,399
"Breakneck" was, uh,
just a terrific--

346
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,168
really terrific film.

347
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:41,969
-Thank you.

348
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,706
-Yeah, it was really terrific.

349
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,809
It was really terrific.

350
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:49,843
-Thank you very much.

351
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,694
STEVE: What is
with the whinnying?

352
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:08,695
CATRICE: Oh, gosh.

353
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,431
What, you want to
pack a bag and go?

354
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,399
-Hey.

355
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,533
What's in the bag?

356
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,769
-Oh, your wife said why
not take something home

357
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,037
when there's all this Parmesan.

358
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,107
-Sure.

359
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,142
Enjoy.

360
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,744
So, uh, I guess we'll
be in touch soon, huh?

361
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,314
I mean, there's been no
word on that Paramount part.

362
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,416
-Paramount part?

363
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,383
-Oh, come on.

364
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,153
You know, the lawyer
on your feature.

365
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,022
-I'm going to kill
that casting agent.

366
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:35,823
-What?

367
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:36,589
-Nobody called you?

368
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,690
-No.

369
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,192
-They were supposed to
call you a week ago.

370
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,994
We went another way.

371
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,562
-Oh, I didn't know.

372
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:46,299
-I feel like a complete putz.

373
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,434
-Ah, what's the difference, huh?

374
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,301
It's just another part.

375
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,569
Who cares?

376
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,839
Give me back my cheese
though, you prick?

377
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,976
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

378
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,077
-So who'd they go with?

379
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,211
-Oh, what difference
does it make?

380
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,012
Somebody else.

381
00:12:59,112 --> 00:12:59,813
-I know.

382
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,680
I'm just curious.

383
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,481
Who?

384
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,916
-Rudy Ptak.

385
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,451
-Oh, Rudy?

386
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,252
Good.

387
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,419
Uh, he's good-- good actor.

388
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,220
-Think so?

389
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,288
-Good choice, yeah.

390
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,022
-Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear you say that.

391
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:09,990
-Yeah.

392
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,358
-Takes a load off my mind.

393
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,961
All right, see ya.

394
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,762
-See ya, Maurice.

395
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:19,199
[engine starting]

396
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,071
-Rudy Ptak?

397
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,873
Rudy Ptak.

398
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,140
We're the same guy.

399
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,275
He's me.

400
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,811
They're using me, except
I'm not getting paid.

401
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,881
How the hell could this
be happening, Hannah?

402
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,648
I was right in the
pocket with this role.

403
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,749
I had it.

404
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,784
-Honey, you're going
to have to calm down.

405
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:38,751
You'll make yourself sick.
-No.

406
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,854
No, I had this
feeling this time.

407
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,423
Like for once I was
going to slip through.

408
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,658
Do a character with some
layers, with something

409
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,128
more than a
fourth-grade education.

410
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,997
Instead, it's the same old shit.

411
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,899
Second chooch from the left.

412
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,699
-Now, come on.

413
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,800
Quit putting yourself down.

414
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:54,767
You are a success.

415
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:55,768
CATRICE: Oh, Christ.
Hannah, please.

416
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:56,803
-You work more than those guys.

417
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,538
-Not the glass is half full bit.

418
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,673
Not this time, please.

419
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,474
[sigh]

420
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,115
Who am I kidding?

421
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,750
The De Niros, the
Pacinos, the Hoffmans.

422
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,953
The [inaudible].

423
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,989
I'm just one of the ottomans
hanging on a branch.

424
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,393
[sigh]

425
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,361
Screw them.

426
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,762
I'm not going to
let them get to me.

427
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,563
I'm not.

428
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:31,238
You're my little angel.

429
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,039
[inaudible]

430
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,481
-What happened, Daddy?

431
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,615
You lose another part?

432
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:47,654
-No, no.

433
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,588
It's all right, honey.

434
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,690
Go back to sleep, OK?

435
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,059
Daddy loves you.

436
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,463
Oh, god.

437
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,697
I'm starved.

438
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,100
And that prick took our
Parmesan, too. $12 a pound.

439
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,168
-Well, I said he could take it.

440
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,435
-Why?

441
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,503
-Because it's not good for
you, but you can have some

442
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,671
of that soy cheese I
got at [inaudible].

443
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:05,238
-Soy cheese?

444
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:05,872
[phone ringing]

445
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:06,439
That's not cheese.

446
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,240
That's spackle.

447
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,209
You cover your walls with it.

448
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,277
-Hello?

449
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,078
Hi.

450
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,580
How's it going?

451
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,547
Uh, yeah.

452
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,882
Hang on.
Just a second.

453
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:16,916
Johnny?
-Oh, no.

454
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,718
-It's Theresa.

455
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:19,652
-Oh.

456
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,054
-I don't know.

457
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,355
-Oh.

458
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,156
Hey.

459
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,557
Hi, Theresa.

460
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,425
-Hi, Johnny.

461
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,726
Uh, party was great.
Thanks.

462
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:27,760
But listen.

463
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,796
There's something
I couldn't bring up

464
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:30,930
with all those
people in the room.

465
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,565
But first, you
gotta promise me--

466
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,004
and I mean, no bullshit, Johnny,
that you won't tell a soul.

467
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,939
This is the most hush-hush
thing I've ever worked on, OK?

468
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,741
My ass is on the line with this.

469
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:42,942
-Theresa, I can keep a secret.

470
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:43,843
What?

471
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,844
-Oh, yeah?

472
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,812
You're like a
one-man wire service.

473
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,414
You compete with
CNN for God's sake.

474
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,415
Now, promise me.

475
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,282
-Yeah.
All right.

476
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,217
What is it?

477
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,751
-Cross your heart
and hope to die.

478
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,487
-OK, cross my heart.

479
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,855
-And hope to die.

480
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,823
-And hope to die.

481
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,259
For God's sake, now what is it?

482
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,629
-Scorsese is doing "Capone."

483
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,896
He's in from New York.

484
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,532
He's seeing a few people.

485
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,599
It's all very QT.

486
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,368
And he asked me to help me out.

487
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,271
Now, he saw you on "NYPD Blue"
and he wants you to come in.

488
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,472
He liked you.

489
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,973
-He did?
THERESA (ON PHONE): Yeah.

490
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:14,874
He wants you to read.

491
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,244
-For what?

492
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,811
-For Capone, dummy.

493
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,080
They want an unknown.

494
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,481
De Niro can't do it
because he already

495
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,682
did Capone in "The
Untouchables."

496
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:23,983
It's wide open.

497
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,919
But look, don't
breathe a word, OK?

498
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,355
Or else every punk
actor in Hollywood

499
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,823
who thinks he's the next Pacino
or De Niro, which is most

500
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,660
of your friends, will be all
over us like flies on shit.

501
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,329
And Marty doesn't
want that, capisce?

502
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,431
And especially don't
tell Armand, OK?

503
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,767
Because the last thing in the
world I need is to offend him.

504
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:41,734
Now, listen.

505
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,670
If anyone asks
you who's casting,

506
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,805
say your agent got a
call from the producer.

507
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,674
-Yeah, OK.

508
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,342
Theresa, I don't want to say.

509
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,743
-Well, get prepared.

510
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,545
Now, they're going to call you
into Warner Brothers on Friday,

511
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,814
and they're going to give
you something to read then.

512
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,215
-OK.

513
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,283
OK.

514
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,152
I got to ask you, is
Rudy Ptak up for it?

515
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,588
THERESA (ON PHONE): Rudy Ptak
is on a series until April.

516
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,790
Listen, Johnny, I
want you to work.

517
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,658
I want you to go
deep, all right?

518
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,459
-OK.

519
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,294
THERESA (ON PHONE): OK?

520
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,595
None of that TV gumba schtick.

521
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,164
I mean, this is-- this
is Scorsese, all right?

522
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,232
Scorsese.

523
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,333
OK?

524
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,534
I mean, go-- go, go
against your bigness.

525
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,335
OK?

526
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,369
I know you can do it.

527
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,105
I saw you in "American Buffalo."

528
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,806
I know you've got the range.

529
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,774
I mean, you worked with
Stella for god sake.

530
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,709
OK?

531
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,843
So don't embarrass
me, all right?

532
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:24,811
JOHNNY (ON PHONE): All right.
Of course not.

533
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:25,878
No.
No, no, I won't let you down.

534
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,013
I'll go deep, deep.
-All right, go deep.

535
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:27,814
Go deep, John.

536
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:28,915
Deep is the word.

537
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:29,349
Deep.

538
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,450
Deep.

539
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,351
JOHNNY (ON PHONE): You
don't know how deep.

540
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:31,784
-All right, Johnny.
All right.

541
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,485
Please.

542
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,120
Now, work, work, work.

543
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,955
-Thanks, Theresa.

544
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,756
-[sigh].

545
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,898
-Hey, what's up?

546
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,367
Johnny?

547
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,668
Honey, what's wrong?

548
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,002
-Oh.

549
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,471
Oh.

550
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,472
-Honey, what is it?

551
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,273
What's wrong?

552
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,475
Is it your heart?

553
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,144
Just try to relax.

554
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:57,944
Can you breathe?

555
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,447
Just try to-- take-- what?

556
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,314
Should I call 911?

557
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,115
What?

558
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,216
Are you all right?

559
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,418
Please, just-- just
try to take a breath.

560
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,419
Honey, what?

561
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,220
What is it?

562
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,121
Tell me by a hand signal.

563
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:08,921
What?

564
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,891
What?

565
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,892
-Thank you.

566
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:13,893
-Thank you.

567
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:14,694
-Thank you.

568
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,728
Thank you.

569
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,529
You bring me luck.

570
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,665
You bring me luck.

571
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:19,466
Thank you.

572
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:19,966
Thank you.

573
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,767
Thank you!

574
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,402
Thank you, Universe!

575
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,371
-[gasp].

576
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,338
-Oh, god.

577
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,806
Oh, god.

578
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:27,807
Honey.

579
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,041
Are you all right?

580
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:29,842
-Oh.

581
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,078
-What was it?

582
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,480
Was it the "Grapes of
Wrath" dream again?

583
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,281
-Yes.

584
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,248
-Oh, no.

585
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:38,050
On the truck?

586
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:38,985
-Maurice was there.

587
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,052
He was chasing everybody.

588
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,689
He was going to
foreclose on the farm.

589
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,492
I just-- I still
couldn't talk to him.

590
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,459
-Oh, god.

591
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,460
Oh, honey.

592
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,261
Honey.

593
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,929
It's going to be all right.

594
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,364
It's going to be all right.

595
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,265
It's going to be all right.

596
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:52,832
Come on.

597
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:53,400
-Oh, honey, I--

598
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,201
-Come on.

599
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,067
It's going to be OK.

600
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:55,868
It's OK.

601
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,869
It's over.

602
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,837
It's all right.

603
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,271
Ow.

604
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,071
My hair.

605
00:18:59,172 --> 00:18:59,606
Ow.

606
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:00,173
-I'm sorry.

607
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:00,907
-It's all right.

608
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:01,708
It's OK.

609
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,375
It's going to be all right.

610
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,843
It's OK.

611
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,811
It's OK.

612
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:05,612
It's OK.

613
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:06,446
Yeah, it's all right.

614
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,547
JOHNNY: Friday.

615
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,715
I got to have this thing
prepared by Friday.

616
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,283
-Oh, honey, you
have enough time.

617
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,418
JOHNNY: Yeah.

618
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,051
I have enough time if
I'm doing "Baywatch."

619
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,452
But for Scorsese?

620
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,019
-OK.

621
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,520
Come on, girls.

622
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:13,986
Let's go.

623
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,355
-Come on.

624
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,290
And Theresa said go deep.

625
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,126
She made a point of it, go deep.

626
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,594
Did she mean that
I have no depth,

627
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,564
or did she mean find the
depth of the character?

628
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,566
-Honey, what are
you talking about?

629
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,770
You'll be fine, just treat
it like any other audition.

630
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,571
-Come on, mom.

631
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,639
This could put Dad on the map.

632
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,906
He'll finally stopped
being pigeonholed

633
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,276
as a small-time hit
man or slob cab driver.

634
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,344
-Thank you.

635
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,445
Nice thing to say to
your dad, Gabriella.

636
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:39,246
-What?

637
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,280
It's not the way I feel.

638
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,481
It's just the way
this business works.

639
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,081
Right, Dad?

640
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:42,749
-Right.
Right.

641
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,182
Let's go.
Come on.

642
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:43,683
Come on.

643
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,417
Let's go.

644
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,818
Listen.

645
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,921
While we're at it, not a word
of any of this to your friends.

646
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,889
They'll tell their fathers.

647
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:50,990
And before you
know it, there will

648
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,425
be a damn stampede
for this part.

649
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,059
All right?

650
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,060
-Don't worry, Dad.

651
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,161
I never talk business
with my friends.

652
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,463
-Sounds like Pacino
in "The Godfather."

653
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:57,029
All right.

654
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:57,530
GIRL: Hi, Janey.

655
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,365
JANEY: Hi.

656
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,299
-Hey.

657
00:19:59,399 --> 00:19:59,966
-Bye, Mom.

658
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:00,667
Bye, Dad.

659
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,001
-Great party, you guys.

660
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,104
I'm hungover and suicidal,
but I really had a good time.

661
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,739
-And they say she
can't do comedy.

662
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,875
-I love you, Johnny.

663
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:09,709
OK.

664
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,311
Does everyone have their lunch?

665
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,111
Their homework?

666
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,446
Their virtual reality pets?

667
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,247
-All right.

668
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,248
-Let's go.

669
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,148
-Bye Janey.

670
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:20,720
You know something?

671
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,954
Gabriella's right.

672
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,023
This is not like
any other audition.

673
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,792
I got to hit this one
out of the park, hun.

674
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,893
-OK.

675
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,795
So instead of going to
the track with Dorian

676
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,062
or the golf course
with Steve, why

677
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,764
don't you really
prepare on this one?

678
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,565
Hm?

679
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,205
-This is the LA library?

680
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,474
I feel like I'm in Vegas.

681
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,410
I'd like a room adjoining
the casino, please.

682
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,591
-Mm.

683
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,293
-Johnny.

684
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,193
-Dorian?

685
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:01,994
-Hey.

686
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,195
Johnny boy.

687
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,331
How are you?

688
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,598
What the hell are you
doing in the library?

689
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,935
-What are you
doing in a library?

690
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:12,004
-Babette, I'd like you
meet a dear friend of mine.

691
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,007
This is, uh, Johnny
DiMartino, a wonderful actor.

692
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:15,975
-Babette.

693
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:16,976
-Babette's one of my students.

694
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,779
I'm introducing her
to Stanislavski.

695
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:20,980
-Terrific guy.

696
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,882
-Johnny studied
with Stella, too.

697
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:23,683
-Really?

698
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,617
Wow.

699
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:25,117
Oh, that must have
been incredible.

700
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,218
-Oh, yeah.

701
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,054
The quest to unravel
the mystery of subtext

702
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,021
has become the metaphysical--

703
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:29,989
-Johnny's a riot, isn't he?

704
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,057
Do you want to hang on a second?

705
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,492
I'm just going to
walk Babette out.

706
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,029
It's all right, honey.

707
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,230
I got to talk to this guy.
-So, uh, you'll call me?

708
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:38,731
-Yeah.

709
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,366
Yeah.

710
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,166
No, I'll call you.

711
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,100
I'll stop by the restaurant.

712
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,601
All right?

713
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,101
I will.

714
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,035
I promise.

715
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:43,536
I said I promise.
I'll see you.

716
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:43,970
-Bye.

717
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,537
-Bye.

718
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,077
Johnny.

719
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:51,878
-Jesus, Dorian.

720
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:52,979
You're unbelievable.

721
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,947
-Can you not say
anything, please?

722
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,383
Especially not to Hannah.

723
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,517
You know how women are.

724
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:58,618
They tell each other everything.
-Oh, come on.

725
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,419
What do you take me for?

726
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,522
It's not my business.

727
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,957
-Johnny, I can't help myself.

728
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,292
She saw me in "The Crime Story."

729
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,027
She starts asking
me about acting.

730
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:08,861
She's all over me.

731
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:09,896
She wants to get together.

732
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,130
That's why I came here.

733
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,999
I didn't think I'd run
into anybody at a library.

734
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,333
What the hell are you
doing here anyway?

735
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,334
-An errand for Hannah.

736
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:18,270
She needs them for a class.

737
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,474
-Johnny, I'm cursed.

738
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,575
Women love me.

739
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,276
-My heart's breaking for you.

740
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,578
-No, it's the truth.

741
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,382
And the worst part of it
is I love them right back.

742
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,483
Did you look at her?

743
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,818
-Yeah, young enough
to be your daughter.

744
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:32,619
-Exactly.

745
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,020
Is that a curse or not?

746
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,488
This is what wrecked
my first marriage.

747
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,089
Johnny, I thought
it was Samantha.

748
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,959
I thought, all right,
I'm going to settle down.

749
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:45,264
But I swear to god, on our
wedding-- Johnny, I swear.

750
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,899
This babe was with my
cousin from Buffalo.

751
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,668
She came onto me.

752
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,570
I could have got laid
at my own wedding.

753
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,138
Johnny, I can't change.

754
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,673
And now my marriage
is coming apart.

755
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,307
Samantha, I love her.

756
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,409
I don't want to hurt her.

757
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,376
-Jesus, Dorian.

758
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,045
I had no idea things
were this bad.

759
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,947
You're really out
of control here.

760
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,281
You better go see a
shrink or something.

761
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,215
-I did.
I did.

762
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,383
I saw a shrink six months ago.

763
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:04,817
A woman.

764
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:05,852
-Yeah?

765
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,286
-She starts asking
me all about myself.

766
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,120
One thing led to another.

767
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,921
-No?

768
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,022
-No, no, no.

769
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:10,990
We just went-- we just
went out to dinner.

770
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,126
She took me to a
nice place, too.

771
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,029
Johnny, I'm freaking miserable.

772
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,432
-But where do you get
the energy for all this?

773
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,232
-I don't know.

774
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,033
I'm an actor.

775
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,470
I got a lot of down time.

776
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,704
I go to the gym.

777
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,272
Of course, I meet
women there, too.

778
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,073
-Oh, Christ.

779
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,040
You're insatiable.

780
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,341
What gym is this?

781
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,114
-Oh, god.

782
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,215
You know, it's funny.

783
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:37,550
I'm glad I ran into you.

784
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,052
I've been wanting to get this
off my chest for so long.

785
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:43,089
It makes me see, you
know, I got to stop this.

786
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,558
Oh my god, what a day.

787
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,459
You being here, too.

788
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,394
That is weird, huh?

789
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:49,529
Oh.

790
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:50,863
What's Hannah got you
bringing in to class?

791
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:51,731
-No, no, no.

792
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,332
-Come on.

793
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,366
"Capone?"

794
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:58,004
What's-- "Mr. Capone."

795
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,005
What's Hannah doing with that?

796
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,707
She teaches 19th Century poetry.

797
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,008
-Beats the hell out of me.

798
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,175
-You son of a bitch.

799
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,010
-What?

800
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,313
-That stuff's for you, isn't it?

801
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,414
-Sort of.

802
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,215
-So?

803
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,450
So, why the big subterfuge?

804
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,752
Come on, Johnny.

805
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,555
I just got through spilling
my guts out to you.

806
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:16,756
Talk to me.

807
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,157
We'll share secrets.

808
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,094
-OK.

809
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,362
OK.

810
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,664
But you got to promise not
to breathe a word of this

811
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:25,498
to anyone.

812
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,398
Not a soul.

813
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,299
-My lips are sealed.

814
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,901
-Cross your heart
and hope to die.

815
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:29,836
-Jesus.

816
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,303
-Say it.

817
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,271
-Scorsese!

818
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,472
Jesus.

819
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,975
He's going to add a whole
new dimension to Capone.

820
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,878
Physically, you're
perfect for it.

821
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,647
-Why do you say that?

822
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,749
You don't think I'm
emotionally right for it?

823
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:43,550
-No.

824
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,984
You're going to be great.

825
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,519
I'm saying, Theresa was
right to bring you in.

826
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,588
Let me tell you something, this
is a feather in her cap, too.

827
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,856
-Yeah.

828
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:50,557
But you can't mention
anything about her involvement

829
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:51,257
with this.

830
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,358
Especially to Armand.

831
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,793
You know, the two of
them were together once.

832
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:54,594
-Don't even sweat it.

833
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:55,995
It does not go beyond us.

834
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:56,796
-Oh.

835
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,068
-Hi, honey.

836
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:02,869
What happened?

837
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,003
Your audition was canceled.

838
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,104
I didn't know
where to reach you.

839
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,038
-I know.

840
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:06,739
I found out, uh,
when I got there.

841
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,406
Have you seen the, uh--

842
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,708
-So where have you been?

843
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,577
-I was at the--
I was at the gym.

844
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,078
Hey.

845
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,646
-Well, I called Jenny
and Steve and they

846
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,548
didn't know where
you were, so I was--

847
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,515
-I'm sorry, honey.

848
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,049
I know.
-All right.

849
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:17,817
-I know.

850
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:18,585
I'm sorry.

851
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,418
Hey, Barbara, it's Dorian.

852
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,321
Can you-- Dorian.

853
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,690
Get me Harry.

854
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,258
Well, just cut into
his bullshit meeting.

855
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,628
This is an emergency.

856
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:32,131
Honey, could-- the-- the,
uh, sound is-- Harry, listen.

857
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,233
I want you to call Theresa
Reynolds at the Argyle.

858
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,535
She's doing a special casting
session with Scorsese.

859
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,905
He' is doing Al
Capone and he wants

860
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,873
an unknown to play Capone.

861
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,743
No, I am telling you
it's happening, Harry.

862
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,244
I got it from Johnny DiMartino.

863
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,478
But it's all very hush-hush.

864
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,414
You cannot tell anybody
how you heard about this.

865
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,082
You can't.

866
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,183
Now, Harry.

867
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,953
I-- I am not street enough?

868
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,121
Street my ass.

869
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,189
I'm an actor and
I'm Italian, too.

870
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:57,990
What?

871
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,962
So what if my family
came from Florence?

872
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,697
They had murderers in
Florence, too, Harry.

873
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:05,497
Listen.

874
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,532
I am right for this part.

875
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,034
I am calling in the
chips on this one.

876
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,435
Now, you call that
bulimic bitch, Theresa.

877
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,138
See if you can't get her
head out of the toilet

878
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,840
long enough for her to
schedule me an appointment.

879
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,641
Thank you.

880
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,813
-Are you still there, Harry?

881
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,614
Yes.

882
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:22,715
No.

883
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,583
That's my, uh-- it's
not water running.

884
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:25,484
I'm-- I'm in my car.

885
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,886
I'm moving through
Laurel Canyon.

886
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:27,687
Dammit.

887
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,256
How did you hear about this?

888
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:33,826
Your daughter's dating a
guy in the mail room at CAA?

889
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,929
The place to meet future moguls?

890
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,864
Great.

891
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,833
You haven't told
anyone, have you?

892
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,569
Uh-huh.

893
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,470
Yeah.

894
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,738
Hey.

895
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,106
I know you helped me
out with the "Barney

896
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,808
the Dinosaur Special," Harry.

897
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:49,776
I haven't forgotten.

898
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:53,245
Now, what do you want?

899
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,915
Dorian.

900
00:26:56,015 --> 00:27:03,355
I know he's a lovely
actor, but I mean-- no, I

901
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,491
didn't know his
father was Sicilian.

902
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,259
-Harry, you are beautiful.

903
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,160
You are beautiful.

904
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,961
Thank you.

905
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,396
Thank you.

906
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,799
Hey, you didn't tell anybody
how you heard about this, right?

907
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:13,599
Great.

908
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,400
3:30 on Friday.

909
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,467
Harry, I love you.

910
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,268
I love you.

911
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,436
You are the greatest.

912
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,404
Yes.

913
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,171
Yes.

914
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:22,641
I'm in.

915
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,310
-Well, that's just great.

916
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,312
And what are you going to
tell Johnny if he finds out?

917
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,246
-He's not going to find out.

918
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,614
We're going in at
different times.

919
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:29,749
-And what if you get the part?

920
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,517
-Well, then I'll tell
him my agent got me up

921
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,285
for it, which is
the truth almost.

922
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,086
-You know what?

923
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,021
I think it stinks.

924
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:35,955
-What?

925
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,724
-Johnny and Hannah
are like family.

926
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,726
She's one of my closest friends.

927
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,027
-Honey, Johnny is
like a brother to me.

928
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,494
But this part doesn't
have his name on it.

929
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,931
And this is a chance
to meet Scorsese.

930
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:45,732
Scorsese.

931
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,532
-(MOCKINGLY) Scorsese.

932
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,138
-Hey, honey.

933
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,139
-Hey.

934
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,607
Hi.

935
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:59,411
-Honey, would you give
me that Phillips head?

936
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,080
The pointy yellow one.

937
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,881
-Oh.

938
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,318
-How was the library?

939
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,186
-OK, I guess.

940
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,187
I got books.

941
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,055
-Good.

942
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,056
What'd you have for lunch?

943
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:10,857
-I didn't eat.

944
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:11,724
I wasn't hungry.

945
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,027
What?

946
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,100
Come on, what?

947
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,369
-You got to promise
not to tell, Hannah.

948
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,104
You got to cross your
heart and hope to die.

949
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,239
-Please, what is it?

950
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,374
-I ran into Dorian
at the library.

951
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:29,441
-Yeah?

952
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,910
-He was with some
gorgeous young bimbo.

953
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,779
And believe me, they
weren't there to read.

954
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,813
-Oh, no.

955
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,047
-And that's not all.

956
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,315
He's been doing
this kind of thing

957
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,683
ever since they were married.

958
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,752
He sounded like a one-man
deflowering expedition.

959
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:40,552
-Oh my god.

960
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,353
Poor Samantha.

961
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:41,921
-I know.

962
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:42,889
I know.

963
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,023
It's a mess, but
you can't tell her.

964
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,958
It's their marriage,
for them to work out.

965
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,059
-I feel terrible.

966
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,227
What am I supposed to
say when I see them?

967
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,161
-Nothing.

968
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,262
We care about both
of them, right?

969
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,597
We stay out of it.

970
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,932
Even those he's being
a major asshole.

971
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,034
-I just don't believe it.

972
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:55,902
-I know.
I know.

973
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:56,969
It's amazing.

974
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,637
On the one day in
maybe a decade that I

975
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,839
decide to go into a library.

976
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,008
Then I started
thinking, maybe he's

977
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,510
been put there for
my work on Capone.

978
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,246
You know, get into his evil
soul, the lies, the betrayal.

979
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,848
You know, maybe it's an omen.

980
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:09,882
You know, work him a little.

981
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,017
-Wait-- wait a minute.

982
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,085
You're going to substitute
Dorian for Capone?

983
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,453
I mean, he's from Connecticut.

984
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,487
His dad's an orthodontist.

985
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,288
-I know.

986
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:16,856
I know.

987
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:17,857
That's my point.

988
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,991
I'm trying to find
Capone and I could

989
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,960
end up doing an
Italian Seinfeld.

990
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,461
I'm losing my mind on this.

991
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,796
And who the hell has
got time to read?

992
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,797
No, no, no.

993
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,232
For this, I need a
jolt int he guts.

994
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,734
A direct connection
to my Sicilian roots.

995
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:32,972
Please, Hannah.

996
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,506
I need a guy who kills,
not a guy who naps.

997
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,607
No, No.

998
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,443
For this, I need to
talk to a real mob guy.

999
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,011
-Honey, you don't know
any real mob guys.

1000
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,379
-I know.

1001
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,481
All these years playing hit men
and I've been phoning it in.

1002
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,416
But you know, then it struck me.

1003
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,752
Maybe I do know somebody and
he's right under my nose.

1004
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:47,553
-Who?

1005
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,255
-Armand, that's who.

1006
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:50,122
-Ha.

1007
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,357
Armand?

1008
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,158
-Of course.

1009
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,492
Come on, all that money.

1010
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,095
His mysterious family back
East no one's ever seen.

1011
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,463
Plus, what's he known for?

1012
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,265
-I don't know, his
salad dressing?

1013
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,166
-No.

1014
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,367
No, Scott Goldstein.

1015
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,169
His agent, remember?

1016
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:06,038
Scott never set him up for that
terrorist role in "Die Hard 2."

1017
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,707
Armand flipped, punched
him out, broke his jaw.

1018
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,376
-So?

1019
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,245
-So he did the one thing
every actor's dreamed of doing

1020
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,646
but never had the balls to do.

1021
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,015
It was legendary.

1022
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,350
It was the only time Armand
ever got mentioned in "Variety."

1023
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,785
On top of that, he's brilliant.

1024
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,521
-Theresa specifically said do
not mention this to Armand.

1025
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:23,722
-No, no.

1026
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,457
She doesn't want him to
know that she's involved,

1027
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,725
that's all.

1028
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,760
I'll tell him the producer
has called me in directly.

1029
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,196
I have to talk to Armand.

1030
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:33,832
I have to.

1031
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:34,800
-Well, no.

1032
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,368
You got to go easy
on those capers

1033
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:37,703
because you don't
want them to overwhelm

1034
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,071
the taste of the salmon.

1035
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,072
Yeah.

1036
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,673
You got to go easy
on the cream, too.

1037
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,909
[dog barking]

1038
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:43,709
-Hey, Java.

1039
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,510
Take it easy.

1040
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,477
It's all right, boy.

1041
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,412
It's Uncle Johnny.

1042
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,347
That a boy.

1043
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,748
You little Nazi prick.

1044
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,716
-What?

1045
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:51,783
It's not boned?
You got to bone it.

1046
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,052
You don't want bones
in the cream sauce.

1047
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:53,819
Hey, John.

1048
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,586
Johnny's here.

1049
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,421
All right, Steve.

1050
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,455
-Hey, I heard you.

1051
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:57,823
Two grown men sharing recipes.

1052
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:58,991
You banging him, too?

1053
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,259
Personally, he's not my type.

1054
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,761
I prefer guys with talent.

1055
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,562
-Capone?

1056
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,964
Incredible.

1057
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:05,764
And Scorsese?

1058
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,598
Wow.

1059
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,633
That's a tremendous opportunity.

1060
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,135
Jeez, so, uh, what's
the problem, huh?

1061
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,636
-Well, you know,
I'm pretty sure I

1062
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,104
got the big vicious thing down.

1063
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,139
You know, the cocky asshole.

1064
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,540
The flashy,
over-the-top dresser.

1065
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,341
The ladies' man.

1066
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,542
-Oh, really?

1067
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,544
I think ladies' man would
stump you completely.

1068
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,345
-Come on, Armand.

1069
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:19,778
Please.

1070
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,512
Come on.

1071
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,680
It's the other stuff.

1072
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,515
The deep, quiet thing.

1073
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,451
Those swirling
Sicilian currents.

1074
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,685
That's what I need.

1075
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:27,920
-Swirling Sicilian currents?

1076
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,055
-Yeah.

1077
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,656
You know, like Pacino
had in "The Godfather."

1078
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,024
Like Marlon has.

1079
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:32,858
You have it, too, Armand.

1080
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,492
-I do?

1081
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,326
-Oh, yeah.

1082
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,727
Something you carry with you.

1083
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,096
It's an intangible.

1084
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:37,930
-Well, thanks, Johnny.

1085
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,730
But you got it, too.

1086
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,865
Anybody has.

1087
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:40,666
-Nah.

1088
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,068
I went to Catholic school.

1089
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,136
I was an altar boy.

1090
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,604
I never looked
death in the face.

1091
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,043
-What makes you think I did?

1092
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:54,446
-I don't know, a feeling.

1093
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,182
Armand, I-- I need
something real.

1094
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:59,385
I need something as
ancient and as Italian

1095
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:04,023
as-- as this clove
of garlic here.

1096
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:04,991
-All right.
All right.

1097
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:05,992
Hey.
Hey, we'll start right there.

1098
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,259
-What?

1099
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,261
-You slice the garlic, you
help me make a sauce, huh?

1100
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,596
What could be deeper than that?

1101
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:11,530
Here.

1102
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,664
-You serious?

1103
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,932
-Yeah.

1104
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,268
Come on, smell this.

1105
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,471
That's the power of
your tradition, right?

1106
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,507
Come on, slice it up.

1107
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,576
Got to connect with
the swirls, right?

1108
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,946
Connect with these swirls.

1109
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:28,847
-Ah.

1110
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,650
Ooh, I cut myself.

1111
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,019
-Hey, well, there you go.

1112
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,520
Hey, real blood, huh?

1113
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,587
Now we're talking.

1114
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,155
-Oh.

1115
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:36,822
What the hell?

1116
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:37,990
Am I out of my mind?

1117
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,925
I'm talking to a demented
Wolfgang Puck here.

1118
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:40,726
-Hey, Johnny.

1119
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,628
Can you get me in to read?

1120
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,463
-What?

1121
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,798
-Well, you say I
got Sicilian swirls.

1122
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,034
There's got to be
other parts, right?

1123
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,968
Other Sicilian swirlers, right?

1124
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,303
-Ah, what a business.

1125
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,571
All right, Armand.

1126
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,373
I mean, if I get in the
door, I'll see what I can do.

1127
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,407
Now, come on, Armand.

1128
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,475
I need your help.

1129
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,311
-All right, I'll tell
you what I think.

1130
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,647
The guys with real balls,
they never show it.

1131
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,749
The scariest guy I ever met,
he looked like the grocer

1132
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:04,750
down the street.

1133
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,352
He blended in like
your average Joe.

1134
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:10,089
But if you ever looked into
his eyes, he didn't blink.

1135
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,957
It was like looking in
to the eyes of a shark.

1136
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,159
They-- they were dead eyes.

1137
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,298
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1138
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,867
That's good.

1139
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,337
-Quiet and calm, dead eyes.

1140
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,305
-Right.

1141
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,773
Right.

1142
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:28,940
Dead eyes.

1143
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:29,775
-Right.

1144
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,044
All right, let's give it a shot.

1145
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,083
That's it.

1146
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,917
That's it.

1147
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,986
Feel it.

1148
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:41,787
Good.

1149
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:42,621
Good.

1150
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,822
Yeah.

1151
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,424
You know, your hair is
perfect for this, Johnny.

1152
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:49,561
You're going to have to lose
about 50 pounds, though.

1153
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,763
So is Rudy Ptak up for the role?

1154
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,499
-You had to mention
his friggin name?

1155
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,202
-Hey, come on.

1156
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:59,171
Use your anger.

1157
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,672
That's it.

1158
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,143
You're doing it.

1159
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:07,146
[dog barking]

1160
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,562
[dog crying]

1161
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,204
-My life is like some weird
cosmic test, you know?

1162
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,406
I haven't worked in
a year and a half.

1163
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,975
You know, if God has
given me all this talent,

1164
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,945
why doesn't he give
me a way to use it?

1165
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,046
It's a curse.

1166
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,548
It's a punishment.

1167
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:43,549
-A punishment?

1168
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,051
For what?

1169
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,586
-I don't want to do this, OK?

1170
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,954
-No, look.

1171
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,123
I think-- why don't you try to
go up for this Capone thing?

1172
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,459
-Because it's a
secret thing, OK?

1173
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,428
And I-- I wouldn't cross Johnny.

1174
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,164
-You're an actor just
like everyone else.

1175
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,798
Why shouldn't you go up for it?

1176
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,668
-Because I wouldn't do
a thing like that, OK?

1177
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:03,469
End of story.

1178
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:14,413
[car honking]

1179
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:15,214
-Jo.

1180
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,515
You forget I needed the car?

1181
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,783
That audition's in 20 minutes.

1182
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:18,584
-No.

1183
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,585
I didn't forget.

1184
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:20,586
-You didn't?

1185
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:21,653
So what-- what happened?

1186
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:22,721
-Nothing.

1187
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,522
I'm sorry.

1188
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,055
-Jo?

1189
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:24,890
-Good luck.

1190
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,692
-Jo, don't do this to me, OK?

1191
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,759
What's happening?

1192
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:28,860
Will you tell me what's
going on, please?

1193
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,661
-OK.

1194
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,696
I had to go to the bank.

1195
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,730
We bounced another check.

1196
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,466
-Oh, no.

1197
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,667
Who was it this time?

1198
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,410
We bounced a check on my mother?

1199
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,949
-Johnny DiMartino
for the Casper's

1200
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:55,454
famous low-fat hot dog spot.

1201
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,988
This is my father.

1202
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,491
He comes with me.

1203
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:00,859
-Oh, right.

1204
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,694
You're on the list.

1205
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:03,829
-Hey, you're late.

1206
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,364
What the hell happened?

1207
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:06,164
-We got hung up.

1208
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,040
-OK.

1209
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,976
I'm going to need you
right here, right in tight.

1210
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,279
And when I say
action, then you go.

1211
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,146
I love the sweatshirt.

1212
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,214
It's a nice touch.

1213
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,683
-Thank you.

1214
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,484
-OK.

1215
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,318
And action.

1216
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,085
-Why are you breathing so hard?

1217
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,987
What's the matter with you?

1218
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,858
I just dropped two-thirds of
my fat and half my calories.

1219
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,594
-Two-thirds of your fat
and half your calories?

1220
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,595
That's wonderful, sir.

1221
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,764
-Um, Tony, right?

1222
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:39,665
JOHNNY: Johnny.

1223
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,599
-OK.

1224
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,867
The idea of doing
it like Scarface

1225
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,335
is interesting, sort of.

1226
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,904
But this is an
upstairs/downstairs thing.

1227
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,773
The bun is the
schlepper who's been

1228
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,241
carrying the hot
dog like forever.

1229
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,041
-Aha.

1230
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,209
-So you're-- yeah.

1231
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,312
So you're more of a
swelled head poshon, dig?

1232
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,315
Think John Goodman in pink
tights, but not too shitcky.

1233
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:59,385
We want a little Larry Sanders
reality thing to it, too.

1234
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:00,185
You dig?

1235
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:00,986
-Not too shitcky.

1236
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,860
STEVE: What are you doing?

1237
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,695
-Hm?

1238
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:10,796
-What are you doing?

1239
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:11,597
-What?

1240
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:12,698
-That thing with your eyes.

1241
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:13,732
What are you doing?

1242
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:14,566
Stop it, Johnny.

1243
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,667
You're blowing this job for me.

1244
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:16,668
I need it.

1245
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,504
Snap out of it.

1246
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,505
-Oh, uh, sorry.

1247
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:20,306
Stevie.

1248
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,172
Hey, Trent.

1249
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:21,973
Trent, look.

1250
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,641
I'm sorry.

1251
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,442
I was trying something.

1252
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,710
It didn't work.

1253
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,778
Uh, Larry Sanders
via the Flintstones

1254
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,046
but not too shticky.

1255
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,581
It's a beautiful concept, Trent.

1256
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:30,949
-Let's do it.
-Very Spielbergian.

1257
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:31,750
-Thanks.

1258
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,184
Uh, Johnny, listen.

1259
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,220
Uh, the original
idea was to go with

1260
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,022
an emaciated anorexic pickle.

1261
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,991
You know, Kate Moss and
vinegar kind of thing.

1262
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,295
But pickles also come
aged and wrinkled.

1263
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:46,598
And some of the clients have
worked with your father before

1264
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:51,069
and thought that he might
be right for the spot.

1265
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:51,870
-[snoring].

1266
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,442
-Oh, god.

1267
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,680
-My father's a garbage man
in New York for 40 years.

1268
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,581
He comes out to Hollywood.

1269
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:03,682
He's got a bigger
career than me.

1270
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,916
-Yeah.

1271
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,352
Well, at least one of us
is getting a damn callback.

1272
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,586
I hate your guts, Nino.

1273
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:08,387
-What?

1274
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,220
No.

1275
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,357
I had a salami sandwich before.

1276
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:14,693
-Salami?

1277
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,527
-Star material, no?

1278
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,662
-Yeah.

1279
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,697
Well, the fruit doesn't
fall far from the tree.

1280
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,965
-All right.
All right, pops.

1281
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:20,766
Sit down.

1282
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:21,767
Come on, let's go.

1283
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,201
I got to get to practice.

1284
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,536
I got a lot of
things to do today.

1285
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,205
-So what was that thing that,
uh, you were doing before?

1286
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,374
-What thing?

1287
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,208
-That-- that weird
thing with your eyes.

1288
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,009
-Oh, why?

1289
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,744
You like it?

1290
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:33,645
-I like it?

1291
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,847
Do I like it for what?

1292
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:36,882
-Hey, kids.

1293
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,149
We're here.

1294
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,084
Hi.

1295
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:39,918
-Hi, Daddy.

1296
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:40,719
Hi, Daddy.

1297
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,252
-Daddy.

1298
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:41,887
-Hi, there.

1299
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,721
Hey, sweetie.

1300
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,655
-Can I be up first?
-Yeah.

1301
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:44,456
Yeah.

1302
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,457
Go-- uh, give me a second.

1303
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,024
-OK.

1304
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,225
-Hey, Anthony.

1305
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,694
Twice around the bases
on the double, all right?

1306
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,696
-You know, I spoke
with Dorian earlier.

1307
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,064
And, uh, he asked me
if I had talked to you.

1308
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,666
And I told him I hadn't.

1309
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,235
And he dropped it, like
it wasn't important.

1310
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,270
Which made me think right
away something was up.

1311
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,071
-Really?

1312
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,272
-Yeah, really.

1313
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:04,410
And now you start in with
this weird eye thing.

1314
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,213
You want to tell me what
the hell's going on or not?

1315
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,715
-Nothing.

1316
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,450
Nothing's going on.

1317
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,718
-15 years of acting
class, you're

1318
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,086
still the worst
liar on the planet.

1319
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:15,954
I'm hurt, man.

1320
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:16,755
Really.

1321
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,123
I am really hurt.

1322
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,592
And after you nearly blew
that audition for me, too.

1323
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,393
-Hey.

1324
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,060
All right.
Hold it.

1325
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,461
Hold it.

1326
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,695
Jesus.

1327
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:26,097
You're like Carl Sagan
looking for a speck of dust

1328
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,766
in another solar system.

1329
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,567
All right, look.

1330
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,501
Look.

1331
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,602
If I tell you,
you got to promise

1332
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,337
not to say a single
word of this to anyone.

1333
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,104
Not--

1334
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:33,905
-Hey.

1335
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:34,339
Hey.
Who you talking to?

1336
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,073
It's me.

1337
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,742
It's Steve.

1338
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:39,645
-You got to promise not to
get into the actor envy thing.

1339
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:42,313
Not on this one, please?

1340
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,449
-Oh, god.

1341
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:47,986
This one's really going
to kill me, isn't it?

1342
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:48,787
Unbelievable.

1343
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,388
Unbelievable.

1344
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,757
And Capone has never
been done right.

1345
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:52,558
Never.

1346
00:39:52,658 --> 00:39:53,625
Well, sure.

1347
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,460
Sure.

1348
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,494
Leave it-- leave it to Scorsese.

1349
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:56,595
I mean, look what
he did with LaMotta.

1350
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,029
-Exactly.

1351
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:58,830
-Oh, man.

1352
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,031
I-- I am stoked.

1353
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,266
I'm inspired.

1354
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,067
You know why?

1355
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,469
-Why?

1356
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,572
-Because if this can happen for
you, then anything is possible.

1357
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,006
Peaks and valleys.

1358
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,675
Life is peaks and valleys.

1359
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,042
That's what my
shrink always said.

1360
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,410
And he was right.

1361
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:16,314
I-- I just happened to have
been in a valley for a while.

1362
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,483
That's all.

1363
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,850
-More like the Great
Canyon I'd say.

1364
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,651
-Yeah.

1365
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,419
Well, tell me about it.

1366
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,456
Anyway, the universe
is smiling on you.

1367
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,492
It's time for gratitude.

1368
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,493
-You're right.

1369
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:28,293
You're right.

1370
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:29,628
-Now, look.

1371
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,563
If there's anything I can do,
you need any kind of help,

1372
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,498
you call me.

1373
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,599
I'm there for you.

1374
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,967
You're going to have
to fight your tendency

1375
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,435
to go over the top.

1376
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:38,937
-Over the top?

1377
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,272
I don't have a tendency
to go over the top.

1378
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,340
-No.

1379
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,642
I just-- I mean, your bigness.

1380
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:44,042
-Oh.

1381
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,110
Oh.

1382
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:45,611
-You know, your
larger-than-life persona.

1383
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:46,545
-Oh, yeah.

1384
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,413
But that works
for the character.

1385
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,681
I just have to
keep it reined in?

1386
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,482
-Yes.

1387
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,650
Exactly.

1388
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,518
Rein it in.

1389
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,218
Let it simmer.

1390
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,052
You let it percolate.

1391
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,320
And then, boom.

1392
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,221
You let it explode.

1393
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,288
-Exactly.

1394
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,224
Blow the fuckers right
out of the water.

1395
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,092
-That's right.

1396
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,194
Hold on a second.

1397
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,362
Is Ptak up for it?

1398
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,163
-No.

1399
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:05,964
No, no.

1400
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,232
The door's wide open.

1401
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,534
I just have to walk right in.

1402
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,704
All right.
All right.

1403
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,805
All right.
Come on.

1404
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:14,640
All right, sweetheart.

1405
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,440
You remember.

1406
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,407
Watch the bat.

1407
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:17,208
Hit the ball.

1408
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:20,879
-I don't know.

1409
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,749
I just, um-- I just had
to stop by, you see?

1410
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:29,688
And, uh, it's just you-- you
know, you're like family.

1411
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,357
I mean, my real family.

1412
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,491
And, um--

1413
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,292
-Hey, it's OK.

1414
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,695
-It's just--

1415
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:37,663
-You can tell me.

1416
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,164
What is it?

1417
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:46,504
-It's just-- oh, Hannah.

1418
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:49,374
Dorian is going after
that Capone part,

1419
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:52,010
after he promised Johnny
he wouldn't do anything.

1420
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,044
-Oh, no.

1421
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,012
-Please don't tell Johnny.

1422
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,213
Please.

1423
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,081
Because if you do, it
will end their friendship.

1424
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,149
Our friendship.

1425
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,152
But I want you to
know I was against it.

1426
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,355
Oh, I'm so confused.

1427
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:09,194
I swear I feel more loyalty
to you than I do to him.

1428
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:12,263
I'm all alone in
this marriage, Han.

1429
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,866
I asked him if he was having an
affair straight out like that

1430
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:15,967
and he said, no.

1431
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,769
You know, it's just
all the career stress.

1432
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:18,704
All the craziness.

1433
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,506
-Yeah.

1434
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:22,507
-Oh, god.

1435
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,610
And I took my diaphragm
out last month.

1436
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,111
-What?

1437
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:26,912
What?

1438
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:27,713
You--

1439
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:28,680
-I threw it away.

1440
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,415
-You threw away your diaphragm?

1441
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,283
-I want to have a family, Han.

1442
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,685
Acting isn't my calling.

1443
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,553
I just get cast
as bimbos, anyway.

1444
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:36,521
-I know that.

1445
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:38,223
But listen to me,
having a baby is

1446
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,625
not going to solve
your problems.

1447
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:40,959
-I know.

1448
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,395
But-- you know, we only made
love eight times last month.

1449
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,463
We're married three years.

1450
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,665
Don't you think it's
a little soon to be

1451
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:49,367
making love only
eight times a month?

1452
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,535
-I should be so lucky.

1453
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:51,903
-Oh, I'm serious, Han.

1454
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,171
-Wait a minute.

1455
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,774
Does Dorian know that you
threw out your diaphragm?

1456
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:56,642
-No.

1457
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:57,442
-No?

1458
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,844
-No.

1459
00:42:58,944 --> 00:42:59,978
I want to be a mom, Han.

1460
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:00,912
-I know.

1461
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,047
-I want a baby.

1462
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:05,951
It's the only thing I
feel really sure about.

1463
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:09,821
Everything else is so mixed up.

1464
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,556
-But Steve, you're Jewish.

1465
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:12,357
-Yeah.

1466
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,092
And the pope is Catholic.

1467
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,861
-You don't expect him to
be bar mitvahed do you?

1468
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,095
-Look, Jo.

1469
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,698
All I know is that they
are looking for an unknown.

1470
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:20,866
An unknown.

1471
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:23,134
Who in this town is
more unknown than me?

1472
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,202
-No one.

1473
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,737
-Oh, ha, ha, ha.

1474
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:27,272
Look, this is Scorsese, OK?

1475
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:28,707
It's not some schlepper.

1476
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,075
He needs me.

1477
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,210
We are cut from the same stuff.

1478
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,512
-There's just one
problem, Steve.

1479
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,047
You're not Italian.

1480
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,783
So what does that have
to do with anything?

1481
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:38,616
What are you, a bigot?

1482
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:39,417
JOANNE: [gasp].

1483
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,019
-Besides, you're Italian.

1484
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,688
Don't I get carry-over credit?

1485
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:44,522
I could do this part, Jo.

1486
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,824
Look at me.

1487
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:46,758
I'm perfect.

1488
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:48,159
I am perfect.

1489
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:52,898
Besides, I'll tell
you something else.

1490
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:56,467
I am tougher than Johnny and all
those other guys put together.

1491
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,204
You know, they're just getting
by with their phony street

1492
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,573
bullshit, strutting around
here like middle-aged Fonzies.

1493
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,276
These guys have
made careers feeding

1494
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,113
stereotypes to idiot producers.

1495
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:10,415
But meanwhile, I
am the real thing.

1496
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:14,185
A street guy who clawed
his way up from nothing.

1497
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:17,122
I know what it's like to have
somebody beat the crap out

1498
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:21,126
of me and look me right in the
face and say, hey, Jew boy.

1499
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,361
Hey, Jew boy.

1500
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:26,765
-I'm sorry, but I'm not
making the connection!

1501
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,834
-The connection is the rage.

1502
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,536
The bottomless, unending fury.

1503
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:32,670
That is who Capone is.

1504
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,839
That's who I am.

1505
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:35,373
I feel this part, Jo.

1506
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,674
It's my time.

1507
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:37,642
-And what about Johnny?

1508
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,745
He's your best friend.

1509
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:41,146
Hannah is my best friend.

1510
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:43,114
They're godparents
to our daughter.

1511
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:46,184
-They don't have
to know anything.

1512
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,086
-And what if Jupiter
collides with Mars

1513
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,888
and you actually get this part?

1514
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,758
-Then I say mavel
tov, bravo, and let

1515
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,459
the chips fall where they may.

1516
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,094
-It's a deal with the devil.

1517
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,896
-Well, sometimes when
opportunity knocks,

1518
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,698
you got to grab it, baby.

1519
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,632
Maybe it's fate.

1520
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,369
I mean, look at Brando.

1521
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,137
You know, if he didn't
have that trick knee,

1522
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,605
he would have ended
up in World War II.

1523
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,607
We never would
have heard of him.

1524
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,011
That one little quirk,
that one little deformity

1525
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:15,346
that made all the difference.

1526
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,314
-Wait.

1527
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,515
Am I hearing you correctly?

1528
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:21,052
Are you now comparing
yourself to Brando?

1529
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:21,853
-Yes.

1530
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:22,988
Yes, I am, dammit.

1531
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:23,789
I don't care.

1532
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:24,722
-Oh my--

1533
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:25,523
-Jo, look.

1534
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:26,557
Listen to me.

1535
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,425
I am desperate.

1536
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:28,259
OK?

1537
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,829
I have to make something happen.

1538
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,597
It's either that or
we go back to Newark

1539
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,632
and work in my uncle's
carpet-cleaning business.

1540
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,433
-Newark?

1541
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,135
-Yes, Newark, Jo.

1542
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,670
Carpet cleaning in Newark, Jo.

1543
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:43,608
Newark.

1544
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,380
-OK, we deal with the devil.

1545
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,384
But how are you going
to get in there?

1546
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,187
-Maybe it's finally time
to call my cousin Max.

1547
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,956
-The proctologist?

1548
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,391
-No, Jo.

1549
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,461
The proctologist to the stars.

1550
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,898
He knows every asshole in town.

1551
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,067
MAX: So I take it you
were pleased with the film

1552
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,335
even though the
reviews were scathing?

1553
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,970
-Yeah.

1554
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,573
-Frankly, I thought you had
a few second act problems.

1555
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,809
But hey, we can't be nominated
for Academy Award every year,

1556
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:18,609
can we?

1557
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,245
No.

1558
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:21,046
Right.

1559
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,047
All right.

1560
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:23,048
Todd, hang on.

1561
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,350
You might feel a
little discomfort here.

1562
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,284
-Whoa.

1563
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,118
Woo.

1564
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,419
-Yeah.

1565
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,856
Aren't you glad I didn't say
it was going to hurt, huh?

1566
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,690
All right, we're
almost done here.

1567
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,292
I promise.

1568
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:38,696
Oh, uh, Todd, you're tight with
Marty Scorsese, aren't you?

1569
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,598
TODD: [grunting].

1570
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,133
-Was that a yes or a no?

1571
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:45,470
Sorry.

1572
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:51,642
-Han.

1573
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,610
What are you doing here?

1574
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,979
-Pour me a scotch, will you?

1575
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,779
-A scotch?

1576
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,580
-Mm-hmm.

1577
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,183
-Han, what's up?

1578
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,317
-You're not going
to believe this.

1579
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,786
But look, it's just got
to stay between us, OK?

1580
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,254
JOANNE: Well, sure.

1581
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,056
-I found out that Dorian
has been screwing around

1582
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,058
on Samantha throughout
the entire marriage.

1583
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:07,859
-No.

1584
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,227
-Yes.

1585
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,097
Johnny caught him red-handed
with a beautiful young actress.

1586
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:14,565
And Dorian begs him not to say
anything to me because he's

1587
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,467
afraid I'm going to say
something to Samantha, right?

1588
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,370
Then, Samantha comes over
to the house all upset

1589
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,272
because she's afraid
Dorian is having an affair.

1590
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,108
And I don't say anything.

1591
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,509
-Jesus.

1592
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:28,079
-Then, she tells me that Dorian
is going up for this Al Capone

1593
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,780
part that Johnny
is being brought

1594
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,183
in on by Martin Scorsese.

1595
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:34,519
I mean, Dorian is going
in behind Johnny's back.

1596
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:35,586
Can you believe it?

1597
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,355
And please, don't
say anything to Steve

1598
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:41,092
because it will just
complicate things more, OK?

1599
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,627
Is this nuts or what?

1600
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,795
And Johnny, well, he
won't stop eating.

1601
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,998
He had another shortness of
breath episode the other night.

1602
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,866
I thought he was
having a heart attack.

1603
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,468
I mean, I had to
practically twist his arm

1604
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:51,736
to get him to agree
to have a checkup.

1605
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:54,439
He's making me crazy.

1606
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,573
JOHNNY: What is this place?

1607
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:56,874
They have real doctors here?

1608
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:57,875
HANNAH: Yes, they do.

1609
00:47:57,976 --> 00:47:59,110
-What are we doing?

1610
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,612
A field trip to the
Cloisters over here, or what?

1611
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,681
I feel like a day player
in Ghandi over here.

1612
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:06,051
I'm waiting for Ben
Kingsley to show up.

1613
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:07,085
Come one.

1614
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:08,186
What are you serious
or what over here?

1615
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:09,487
Look at this.

1616
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,189
We got Elsa, the she-wolf of
the SS leading us through.

1617
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:12,157
-Johnny.

1618
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:13,158
-I don't know
whether to genuflect

1619
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,225
or take a urine analysis.
-Let's go.

1620
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:14,692
-All right.

1621
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,526
-Sorry.

1622
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,128
-Where's the holy water fount?

1623
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,629
-It was my pleasure, Johnny.

1624
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,531
You certainly are a big spirit.

1625
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,766
-Yeah. before you're
through with me,

1626
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:23,068
I'm going to be a
much smaller one, huh?

1627
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,369
-Yeah, but in weight only.

1628
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,403
-Come on, doc.

1629
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,437
You're an Italian.

1630
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,772
How do you resist
the Parmesan cheese?

1631
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:29,340
-Moderation is the key, Johnny.

1632
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,408
Moderation.

1633
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,743
-Will moderation get
me to look like you?

1634
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,844
-No.

1635
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,713
You know, I realize
who you remind me of.

1636
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,482
One of my patients.

1637
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:38,316
A wonderful actor.

1638
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,750
I saw him a couple of days ago.

1639
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,551
Rudy Ptak.

1640
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,054
Do you know him?

1641
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:46,891
-Rudy Ptak is in LA?

1642
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:48,193
[phone ringing]

1643
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:48,994
-Hello?

1644
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:49,527
-Hi, Theresa.

1645
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:50,428
It's Johnny.

1646
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:51,762
-Oh, hi, Johnny.

1647
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,099
-Look, I got to ask you, is
Rudy Ptak up for this part?

1648
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:54,899
-What, Ptak?

1649
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,733
No.

1650
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,968
I already told you, he's booked.

1651
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:59,204
-But he's here in LA and
his show shoots in New York.

1652
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,739
-So, maybe he came to
LA to pick up his mail?

1653
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,441
Johnny, you're obsessing.

1654
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:04,409
Stop.

1655
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:05,910
-I'm sorry, Theresa.

1656
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,645
I'm going a little nuts here.

1657
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:08,446
I won't let you down.

1658
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:09,880
I'll go deep.

1659
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:10,848
-OK?

1660
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,183
-Armand's on two.

1661
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:12,984
-[sigh].

1662
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:17,588
Listen, honey.

1663
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,990
I'm sorry I can't make it.

1664
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,026
In fact, I'm booked on a flight
to go back to New York today.

1665
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,693
-That's too bad.

1666
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,829
You know, you ought to give me
a warning next time you come in.

1667
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,497
I really wanted to see you.

1668
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:27,465
Yolanda, too.

1669
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,599
-All right, I promise.

1670
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,967
-All right.
Give your son my love, OK?

1671
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:30,935
-OK, sweetie.

1672
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:31,736
Bye.

1673
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:35,240
[sigh]

1674
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,642
Actors.

1675
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,411
-I just need to get
street a little.

1676
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,613
Rough up, you know?

1677
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:43,948
-What's the part?

1678
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:45,050
-Just a mob guy, you know?

1679
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,685
But I want to give it
some bite, you know?

1680
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:51,022
-It's Capone, isn't it?

1681
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:54,125
Johnny told me
about it yesterday.

1682
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:55,593
-Oh, shit.

1683
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,529
Armand, please, you cannot say
anything to him, all right?

1684
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,530
He'll kind of go crazy.

1685
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,665
What-- what am I supposed to do?

1686
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:01,666
My agent called me.

1687
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:03,334
Am I supposed to say no?

1688
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,037
-What is it about me everybody
tells me their secrets?

1689
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:09,207
-Because you can keep a secret.

1690
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:10,575
Look, Armand.

1691
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,277
Since we're being completely
honest, the reason I came here

1692
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:15,780
was because I thought you might
have an inside track on this.

1693
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,981
-What the hell
you talking about?

1694
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,619
-Well, you never talk
about your past, you know?

1695
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,289
And so I started thinking
that maybe your family was--

1696
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:27,892
-What about my family?

1697
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:29,594
-Well, the-- they
were, you know?

1698
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,696
-What?

1699
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:32,830
-Connected.

1700
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,798
-Connected?

1701
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:35,633
Where do you get this from?

1702
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,434
-Why-- I don't know.

1703
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,335
I just assumed.

1704
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,770
I mean, nobody's ever met them.

1705
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,439
-My family owns two
car dealerships,

1706
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,407
which are totally legit.

1707
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:43,541
-I'm sorry, Armand.

1708
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,311
It's just that you don't
work much and-- I mean,

1709
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,479
you don't have a job job.

1710
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,914
And you just-- you
have a lot of money.

1711
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,516
-Dorian, I made a
few good investments.

1712
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:52,517
Is there a law against that?

1713
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:53,284
-No, no.

1714
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,285
Absolutely not.

1715
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,120
No.

1716
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,287
I apologize.
I'm out of line.

1717
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,088
Look, I'm sorry.

1718
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,055
I'm sorry.

1719
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:58,956
-This is unbelievable.

1720
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,258
I punch out my agent.

1721
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,693
You think I'd murdered somebody.

1722
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,028
If I'd actually
murdered him, I'd

1723
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:05,630
probably have my own
talk show by now.

1724
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,432
Or at least a movie of the week.

1725
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:08,233
Oh, god.

1726
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,434
It's unbelievable.

1727
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:12,036
And they call you some
cushy middle-class poofta

1728
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:13,838
whose mother squeezed him
orange juice every morning.

1729
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:14,639
-Exactly.

1730
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,206
See, you know.

1731
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:16,107
Armand, please.

1732
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,007
You got to help me.

1733
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:17,942
I would be indebted to you.

1734
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:18,709
-All right.

1735
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:19,510
Jeez.

1736
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,179
What are you going to do?

1737
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,348
So what do you want from me?

1738
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,715
-Anything.

1739
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:29,720
If you were directing me,
what-- what would you tell me?

1740
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,622
ARMAND: Dorian, you
got to understand.

1741
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,327
In Capone's world,
it wasn't enough just

1742
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,362
to be brutally tough.

1743
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,430
You had to promote
the idea, too.

1744
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,298
Capone was a strutter.

1745
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:41,532
He was a mug.

1746
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,000
I mean this wasn't
because he was stupid.

1747
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,471
It's because he knew
how to hold the power.

1748
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:48,673
They didn't have elections,
so everybody he met

1749
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,341
was a potential threat.

1750
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,644
The strut and the mug let
them know who was boss.

1751
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:54,445
-Oh, this is good.

1752
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:55,413
This is good.

1753
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:56,781
Do you mind if I
just-- it helps me.

1754
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:57,982
No, this good.

1755
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,150
No, but I understand what
you're talking about.

1756
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,151
It was a PR thing.

1757
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,486
A hype.
ARMAND: No, it was not a hype.

1758
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:02,287
-No, no hype.

1759
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:02,787
Definitely not.

1760
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:03,888
No.

1761
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,956
-I mean, he-- you know,
he could back it up.

1762
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,358
Remember, he was the general.

1763
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:07,792
-Right.

1764
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:08,893
Right.

1765
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:11,696
Like a loose cannon
Patton or a Napoleon.

1766
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,398
This guy was Shakespearean.

1767
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:14,199
He was Dostoevsky.

1768
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,566
-Take it easy.

1769
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,902
What are you going to tell me,
he was a great humanitarian?

1770
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:20,705
Remember, he was one level
above-- above a reptile.

1771
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:21,639
Don't forget that.

1772
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,039
-Right.

1773
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:22,873
Right.

1774
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,841
That's even better.

1775
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,810
A strutting reptile.

1776
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,644
Oh, what an image.

1777
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:27,545
ARMAND: Yeah, go with that.

1778
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:31,249
Come on.

1779
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,217
Take it-- take it
back a little bit.

1780
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:33,017
You know, in general.

1781
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:35,152
Put the arms to the side.

1782
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:35,953
Think it first.

1783
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,922
It's an attitude.

1784
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:41,259
It's an attitude first, and
then it's something physical.

1785
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,727
Reptile.

1786
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:43,494
Cold-blooded.

1787
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:44,295
-Right.

1788
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,164
ARMAND: You're in control.

1789
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:48,533
Reptile.

1790
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:50,401
Dangerous.

1791
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,602
Everybody knows he's boss.

1792
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,238
He doesn't have to prove it.

1793
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,038
-Yeah.

1794
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:54,972
-All right, Dorian.

1795
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:55,806
That's good.

1796
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,342
All you got to do is sell that.

1797
00:52:57,442 --> 00:53:00,345
-All right.

1798
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:04,849
[dog barking]

1799
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:10,355
[dog crying]

1800
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:16,827
-Yeah.

1801
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:31,842
-Honey?

1802
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,582
Maybe you should call Theresa.

1803
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:38,716
She's friends with Scorsese.

1804
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,851
Maybe she can help you
with this audition.

1805
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,853
-She's on a plane
back to New York.

1806
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:46,724
-Well, the plane's going
to land eventually.

1807
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:47,525
-[sigh].

1808
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,726
Why you getting on me?

1809
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,127
Why you pushing this?

1810
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,162
-Because you're sitting in the
dark in the middle of the day,

1811
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:52,963
Armand.

1812
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,632
You're such a wonderful man.

1813
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,133
You're good at so
many different things.

1814
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:56,634
You paint.

1815
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:57,435
You draw.

1816
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:58,369
You build things, you know?

1817
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,737
Maybe it's time
for you to start--

1818
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:00,505
-I'm an actor.

1819
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:01,472
That is my work.

1820
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:04,742
-Fine.

1821
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:05,676
-Oh, Yolanda.

1822
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:06,844
I'm sorry.

1823
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:07,645
Please, wait.

1824
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,846
Please.

1825
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:12,750
It's just that-- I--
I'm bugged by this.

1826
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,686
-I know what you're
bugged by, believe me.

1827
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:18,589
Now, let me ask you this.

1828
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,792
Has it ever occurred to
you once that maybe you

1829
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,228
have some
responsibility in this?

1830
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:27,998
Maybe you are just not
willing to do what it takes.

1831
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,266
You're incredible.

1832
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:32,603
Would it kill you to
schmooze once in a while?

1833
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,771
Use a contact.

1834
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,906
For god sakes, you already
slept with Theresa.

1835
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,207
Shouldn't that
count for something?

1836
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:38,142
-Come on.

1837
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,544
-Oh, great.
I'm getting laughs now.

1838
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:40,445
Maybe I should be an actor.

1839
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:41,379
We can both sit in the dark.

1840
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:43,047
Would you like that?

1841
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:44,549
You know, maybe we can
do a sitcom together--

1842
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:45,816
"Dim Sum Meets the Ravioli."

1843
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,418
Tune in next week,
see what happen.

1844
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,218
-Yolanda, please.

1845
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:57,562
BABETTE (ON PHONE): Hello?

1846
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:58,128
-Hey.

1847
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:58,663
Babette, baby.

1848
00:54:58,763 --> 00:54:59,163
How are you?

1849
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,264
You free?

1850
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:01,198
BABETTE (ON PHONE):
Yeah, but I'm a mess.

1851
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,500
-Well, I don't
care what you look

1852
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,968
like, I'm coming right over.

1853
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:05,436
BABETTE (ON PHONE):
Oh, all right, baby.

1854
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:06,236
-OK.

1855
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:08,773
BABETTE (ON PHONE): Bye.

1856
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:10,375
JOHNNY (ON PHONE): Hi,
it's Johnny and Hannah's.

1857
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:11,175
You know what to do.

1858
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:11,976
[beep]

1859
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:12,777
-Hey, Johnny.

1860
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:13,744
It's me.

1861
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:14,679
Listen, I got a
last-minute looping

1862
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:15,713
session doing that
Pacino picture.

1863
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,047
I don't even think
I can make it today.

1864
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,015
I feel terrible.

1865
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,417
I'll call you later.

1866
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,752
-How come they have no OTV.

1867
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,287
In Los Angeles?

1868
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:26,857
A city like this needs OTV.

1869
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:27,925
-Pop, will you stop it?

1870
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:29,226
I'm trying to work here.

1871
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,695
-You're working too much.

1872
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,162
Let it be fresh.

1873
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,097
-Let it be fresh?

1874
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:34,399
You're turning
into Lee Strasberg

1875
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:35,900
right before my eyes here.

1876
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:41,238
Dorian.

1877
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,708
-You talking to me?

1878
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,175
Me?

1879
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,176
I'm the only one here.

1880
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,145
[car honking]

1881
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,397
Son of a bitch.

1882
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,365
Son of a bitch.

1883
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,776
She is so damn devious.

1884
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,244
-You, too, with this?

1885
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,146
You know, I am insulted.

1886
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:23,347
I am offended.

1887
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:24,415
Not to mention shocked.

1888
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:27,418
-Armand, I feel
like an asshole, OK?

1889
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:30,455
I had no idea that
Johnny was over here.

1890
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:31,756
And Dorian!

1891
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:32,957
That snake.

1892
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:36,326
That two-timing son
of a-- oh my god.

1893
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,194
What am I saying?

1894
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:37,995
-Steve.

1895
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:38,696
Steve.

1896
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:39,730
Why are you doing this?

1897
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,931
Aren't you godfather
to Johnny's kids,

1898
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,166
or he's godfather to yours?

1899
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:42,967
-Both.

1900
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:43,768
-Well?

1901
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:44,569
-I, I had to do it.

1902
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:45,369
I had to.

1903
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,270
I'm dying here, man.

1904
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,137
I'm dying.

1905
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,205
-Tell me about it.

1906
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:49,874
I haven't worked since
the Bicentennial.

1907
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:52,977
-Yeah, but you've got
someone to fall back on.

1908
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,845
-There you go again.

1909
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,914
A guy has a little bit of
money and right away you

1910
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,551
think he's got it from
Murder, Incorporated.

1911
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:06,390
-Well, where did
you get your money?

1912
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,959
-Steve, it is none
of your business.

1913
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,529
-You think Capone ever
had a fruit salad?

1914
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,097
How is it?

1915
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,399
-It's good.

1916
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,234
JOHNNY: Ah, maybe I
should have a bite.

1917
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:18,435
Why not?

1918
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:19,537
What could it be?

1919
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,072
What, 800, 900 calories?

1920
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:26,343
A couple of hundred
grams of fat.

1921
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,144
-Hey, Johnny.

1922
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:27,945
Sorry I'm late.

1923
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:28,946
-Where the hell were you?

1924
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:29,747
-I got hung up.

1925
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,181
I tried to call you.

1926
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,850
-Were you with
that Babette again?

1927
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,919
God, I've been having
fantasies about her.

1928
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,921
Look at me, I'm feeling
guilty about your affair.

1929
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,823
-Will you, please,
Johnny, keep it down?

1930
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:52,770
-You hurt your wife,
I splatter your brains

1931
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,205
all over that fancy
Persian rug of yours.

1932
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,875
-Johnny, I told you,
I'm sick about that.

1933
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,877
-Got ya.

1934
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:00,678
-What?

1935
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:01,946
-Armand gave this to me.

1936
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,614
I told you, the guy's brilliant.

1937
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,282
-Armand gave you that?

1938
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:06,450
Unbelievable.

1939
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:09,053
-And like we suspected,
I think he's connected.

1940
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:09,887
-No.

1941
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,756
No, he owns two car dealerships.

1942
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:16,694
-Yeah, and the Corelone family
was in the olive oil business.

1943
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:18,796
-Son of a bitch, you're right.

1944
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:20,397
-Well, why should
you panic, Steve?

1945
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,267
A Jewish guy who looks like
a rabbi going up for Capone.

1946
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,736
-Hey, Armand, I
can do this role.

1947
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,372
I just-- I need a boost.

1948
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:29,206
An image.

1949
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:29,974
Something.

1950
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:30,474
-All right.

1951
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:31,576
All right.

1952
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:34,845
Now, no offense, but
you're most comfortable

1953
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,313
as the dull neurotic.

1954
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:38,783
And you almost made a living
playing guys like that.

1955
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:39,884
-Yeah, the key word is "almost."

1956
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:40,918
-Yeah, right.

1957
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:44,789
But dullness is a
form of aggression.

1958
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,725
Your job is to get to the
real aggression underneath.

1959
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:50,895
That's where you're going
to find the real colors.

1960
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:54,231
The reds, the purples,
the shocking greens.

1961
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,500
Think of it is as-- as opera.

1962
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,568
That's where these guys live.

1963
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:00,805
It's Pagliacci,
Traviata, [inaudible].

1964
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:01,606
All right?

1965
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:04,341
Now, can you go there?

1966
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,142
-Yes.

1967
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:09,113
How?

1968
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:18,022
-What do you think?

1969
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,431
Come here, Steve.

1970
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:28,232
Come here.

1971
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:39,309
Huh?

1972
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,682
-It's incredible.

1973
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:46,250
Thank you, man.

1974
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,051
-Hey.

1975
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:49,854
No problem.

1976
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:51,622
-This has got to
stay between us, OK?

1977
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:52,923
-Sure.

1978
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,626
And I will be indebted to
you for the rest of my life.

1979
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,427
-Hey, come on.

1980
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,929
Hey.

1981
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,631
Hey.

1982
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:01,431
Come on.

1983
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,399
Come on.

1984
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:04,902
Hey, what did I
tell you about that?

1985
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:06,904
Huh?

1986
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:08,105
-He threw in fresh basil.

1987
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,506
-Oh, he cooked for you
when he gave you the eyes?

1988
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:09,940
-Yeah.

1989
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,175
Yeah.

1990
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,242
Enough with the food,
let's do some improvs here.

1991
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,377
-All right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1992
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:14,144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll put it on its feet.

1993
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:14,945
That always helps.

1994
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:15,946
-Mm, that's a good idea.

1995
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:16,981
Pop, we're going to walk.

1996
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:17,848
Stay here, all right?

1997
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,616
-All right, so what am I?

1998
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:20,718
-My henchman, of course.

1999
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:21,719
-Oh, that's good.

2000
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,420
That's good.

2001
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,221
Good.

2002
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,897
-Oh, I like that.

2003
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:34,164
That bounce, that thing.

2004
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:36,066
I got to use that.

2005
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,736
It's nice.

2006
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:40,570
Hey, you're a good
actor, you prick.

2007
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:41,438
Remind me not to kill you.

2008
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:42,372
-Yeah, sure, boss.

2009
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,974
Whatever you say.

2010
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,209
-[inaudible].

2011
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,010
Oh.

2012
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:46,811
Oh, Rocco.

2013
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,146
Want to take care of this?

2014
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,815
-You gentlemen
care to step aside?

2015
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,086
-Maybe sometime this decade.

2016
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:12,102
-Come on.

2017
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,704
-Don't go too small.

2018
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:14,671
All right?

2019
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:16,140
I think your big
comic impulses might

2020
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,141
be good for the character.

2021
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,342
-I don't get it.

2022
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:19,710
You think I should make
him like more ha-ha funny?

2023
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,510
-No.

2024
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,712
No.

2025
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:24,181
Not ha-ha funny, but like,
you know, weird funny.

2026
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,116
-Weird funny?

2027
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,451
-Don't complicate it.

2028
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:28,252
Just stop.

2029
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,186
Stop, stop.

2030
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,256
Hey, contain it.

2031
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,157
JOHNNY: Contain it?

2032
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,226
-Listen, Johnny.

2033
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:37,027
I got to go.

2034
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:37,795
-Go?

2035
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:38,662
No, no, no.

2036
01:01:38,763 --> 01:01:39,496
No, you can't.

2037
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:40,664
Not now.
-Didn't I tell you?

2038
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:42,032
-No.

2039
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:42,699
-I got the last-minute looping
session on the Pacino thing.

2040
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,500
-You just got here.

2041
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,668
-Oh my god.

2042
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:45,469
-What?

2043
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:46,470
-Don't turn around.

2044
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,938
Those guys are following us.

2045
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:48,906
JOHNNY: Oh, Christ.

2046
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:49,506
Oh, let's go.

2047
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:50,440
Come on.

2048
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,441
Maybe I came on
too strong before.

2049
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,642
-You?

2050
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,011
I gave my best Ray Liotta
in "Angel Dust" look.

2051
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:55,212
That's the kind of thing
you get killed for.

2052
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,713
-Come on, let's get my
father and get out of here.

2053
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,215
DORIAN: Johnny, I wish
I knew how to fight.

2054
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,349
I don't know how
to fight, Johnny.

2055
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,550
I never did.

2056
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,518
Oh, God.

2057
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:02,452
Is this-- this is it.

2058
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,354
It's the end.

2059
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,655
Murdered at Venice Beach.

2060
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:06,924
It's like a bad
movie of the week.

2061
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:07,825
God is punishing me.

2062
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,093
What are we going to do, Johnny?

2063
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:09,894
-Shit.

2064
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,361
What are we, mice or men?

2065
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,696
-What are you saying?

2066
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:14,231
-What do you-- what do
you fucking guys want?

2067
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:15,132
You looking for trouble?

2068
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:15,933
-Whoa.

2069
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:16,733
Whoa, now.

2070
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:18,035
We don't want any trouble.

2071
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,370
Look.

2072
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,607
My name is Joey, and these are
my friends, Paulie and Ralphie.

2073
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:24,741
-How you doing?

2074
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:25,810
-How you doing?

2075
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:26,977
-I'm doing good.

2076
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,113
-Good.

2077
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:30,714
-Now if you don't
mind, I just want

2078
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:32,649
to talk to you for a minute.

2079
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,617
In private.

2080
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:39,023
-He's with me.

2081
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:42,459
-You want to be alone?

2082
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,428
All right.

2083
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:45,562
-OK.

2084
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:47,664
OK, now this may seem
a little off the wall,

2085
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,801
but, uh, I'm in
from Buffalo and I'm

2086
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:55,105
doing some research
on, uh-- La Familia.

2087
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:59,076
You know, people of that ilk?

2088
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:05,549
Now, please, just stop me
right now if I'm out of line.

2089
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:08,285
-No, no, no, continue.

2090
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,054
-Great.

2091
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:12,089
Anyway, when I saw you
guys, I said, Jesus,

2092
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:13,457
this could be the real thing.

2093
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:19,129
So I'm just going to come right
out and ask you, am I right?

2094
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,331
-Are you right?

2095
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,399
Is he right?

2096
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:23,733
-I don't know.

2097
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,636
Is he right?

2098
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,738
-Anything's possible.

2099
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,975
So what's this research for--
a magazine, newspaper article?

2100
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:31,808
what?

2101
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,710
-Actually, no.

2102
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,545
You see, I'm auditioning
for this part tomorrow.

2103
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,449
Do you know the director
Martin Scorsese?

2104
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,251
-This damn Theresa.

2105
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:44,421
What the hell, is every mug from
here to Miami up for this part?

2106
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,891
-You-- you know Theresa?

2107
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:47,858
-Oh.

2108
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:48,692
-It's all right, Johnny.

2109
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:49,759
It's all right.

2110
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,727
Buffalo.

2111
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,728
Got an agent out here?

2112
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,863
JOEY: They got an
office out here.

2113
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:53,563
-Would you-- what's
the matter with you?

2114
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,231
-What?

2115
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,032
-What?

2116
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:55,465
-What?
-I'm helping you.

2117
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,266
-What?

2118
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,067
-I'm helping you.

2119
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:15,119
[phone ringing]

2120
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:16,353
THERESA (ON PHONE):
Hi, it's Theresa.

2121
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:17,521
You've reached Broadway Casting.

2122
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:18,322
You know the drill.

2123
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,290
[beep]

2124
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,199
JOHNNY: Come to Papa.

2125
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:30,867
-You are unbelievable, Johnny.

2126
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:31,801
-Garbage.
Garbage.

2127
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:32,937
-It looks like a curse.

2128
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:34,504
-Come on, when it comes
to poker, I'm Sinatra

2129
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,305
and you're Sonny Bono.

2130
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,406
-Yeah?

2131
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:37,541
Well, when it comes
to acting, I'm De Niro

2132
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:38,442
and you are Desi Arnaz.

2133
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:39,643
-Please.

2134
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:40,877
It's more like I'm Pacino
and you're Pat Sajak.

2135
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,079
-No.

2136
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:45,015
It's more like you're
Costello and he is Abbott.

2137
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,116
And can we please pay cards?

2138
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,084
I'm down $80.

2139
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:48,352
-Oh.

2140
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:49,786
Hey, yeah, speaking of
Italians, I was at Spago today.

2141
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,221
Scorsese was having lunch.

2142
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,327
Yeah, calamari in
a marinara sauce.

2143
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,628
Wonder what he's doing in town.

2144
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,429
MAN: Hm.

2145
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:02,266
Come on, give me an ace.

2146
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:03,467
Ah, damn.

2147
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:04,401
-[inaudible].

2148
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,535
-Not for nothing,
but you know, I

2149
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,404
think Scorsese is
the best there is.

2150
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,473
-Yeah, but he should
stick with what he knows.

2151
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,275
Nobody does street
guys like him.

2152
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,544
-Hey, did you fuck my wife?

2153
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:15,345
-That's a sick question.

2154
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:16,613
You're a sick fuck.

2155
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,048
I'm not going to answer that.
-Did you fuck my wife?

2156
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:19,049
-I'm not going to answer that.
MAN: Did you fuck my wife?

2157
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,317
DORIAN: I'm not
going to answer it.

2158
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,151
I'm not going to answer that.
-Did you fuck my wife?

2159
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,186
-I'm not going to answer that.

2160
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:23,120
-Stevie, what are
they talking about?

2161
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,221
-It's a movie, Mom.

2162
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,789
It's just imitations.

2163
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,124
-I don't know, I
heard some things.

2164
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:27,924
-What things you heard?

2165
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:28,925
-I hear some things.

2166
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:30,094
-What things?
-I heard some things.

2167
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:31,228
-What things?
-I hear some things.

2168
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:32,029
-What things?

2169
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:32,829
-Some things I heard.

2170
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:33,897
-What things?

2171
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:35,032
-You both are over
the top in your manner

2172
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,133
than everything else.

2173
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,701
Because I am, without
a doubt, the finest

2174
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:41,005
Italian American actor
of my generation.

2175
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:42,472
-Danny Aiello.

2176
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,541
-You got it right, Estelle.

2177
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:46,010
-Well, goodbye, Susan.

2178
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,578
And I hope I never
see you again.

2179
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,515
-Tony Curtis.

2180
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,984
[laughter]

2181
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,286
-You're a very funny man.

2182
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:57,087
-Funny how?

2183
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:57,988
-A very funny man.

2184
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:58,822
-What, like a clown?
-No.

2185
01:05:58,922 --> 01:05:59,889
You're a very funny man.

2186
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,158
-What, like I'm here
for your amusement?

2187
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,192
-No, you're a very funny man.
-What, like ha-ha funny?

2188
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,860
-No, you're funny
like this funny.

2189
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,895
-I don't know, but I mean, it's
amazing what one role can do.

2190
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,364
I mean, before
"Raging Bull," Pesci.

2191
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,165
What, he was nothing.

2192
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:11,101
Now he's a big star.

2193
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:14,104
MAN: Did you fuck my wife?

2194
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:15,939
You fuck my wife?

2195
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,840
You fuck my wife?

2196
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,175
DORIAN: No, did
you fuck my wife?

2197
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:19,509
BOTH: Did you fuck my wife?

2198
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:20,477
Did you fuck my wife?

2199
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:21,278
Did you fuck my wife?

2200
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:22,379
Are you talking to me?

2201
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,613
Did you fuck my wife?

2202
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,015
I don't know.

2203
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,416
-[inaudible].

2204
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:27,284
And then Steve.

2205
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:28,085
And then, you know?

2206
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:29,086
And Dorian, too.

2207
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:30,354
It's a total farce.

2208
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,455
Total farce.

2209
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,557
And I do not want to
leap into that insanity.

2210
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,293
-Then why are you helping them?

2211
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:38,295
-Oh, I don't know.

2212
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,064
They're my friends.

2213
01:06:40,164 --> 01:06:41,798
-Ah.

2214
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:45,302
-Yo, am I scary?

2215
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:46,603
-Hm?

2216
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,638
-Am I a threat?

2217
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:53,277
No, they all think I'm
connected, like some mob guy.

2218
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:56,646
-Are you connected, Armand?

2219
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,116
-What is this?

2220
01:06:59,216 --> 01:06:59,983
You, too?

2221
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:02,719
-Well, you are oftly secretive.

2222
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,556
I mean, I've never
even met your family.

2223
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:10,227
-Well, I-- you know, I
hardly see them myself.

2224
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:12,129
-Is it because I'm Chinese?

2225
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:17,667
-I love that you're Chinese.

2226
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,669
I told you, my
marriage ended when

2227
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,207
I became an actor and my
family sided with my wife.

2228
01:07:23,307 --> 01:07:24,174
End of story.

2229
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:31,148
-I got a phone
call this morning.

2230
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:31,948
-Mm-hmm.

2231
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,750
-I got a job.

2232
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,852
-Hey, great.

2233
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:39,256
YOLANDA: In Seattle.

2234
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:40,690
-Seattle?

2235
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,825
-Yeah.

2236
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:44,994
I have to tell them by
tomorrow if I want it.

2237
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:46,296
ARMAND: Tomorrow?

2238
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,866
YOLANDA: It's a really
good graphic arts firm.

2239
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:53,137
I'm sorry to spring this on
you like this, but I-- yeah,

2240
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:57,574
I have to make a decision.

2241
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:58,575
-I guess you do.

2242
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:09,386
-So, if you, uh, want me to
stay, I'd like that very much.

2243
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,288
But I'm going to need more.

2244
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:20,230
-See, I'm thinking the mug,
but I start with a walk.

2245
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:27,937
And then I make it a strut.

2246
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:31,341
And then I add a little bounce.

2247
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,778
But then-- this is
key-- I bring it down.

2248
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,547
I bring it down.

2249
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:38,915
And down.

2250
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:42,586
Then all of a sudden--
boom, I'm letting

2251
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:47,557
the whole world know--
don't fuck with me.

2252
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:50,026
-It's working.

2253
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,995
-It is, isn't it?

2254
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,796
I know.

2255
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:54,998
I can-- I can feel it.

2256
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:55,799
God.

2257
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:56,833
Oh, Sam.

2258
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:59,403
I just-- I love-- I love acting.

2259
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,810
What?

2260
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,279
What?

2261
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:13,550
-You are so good and so pretty.

2262
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,020
You're even prettier than me.

2263
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,488
-Do you really think so?

2264
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:22,959
-Yeah.

2265
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,367
-I love you.

2266
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:31,868
I love you.

2267
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:46,850
-All right, get in the
kitchen and make me a snack!

2268
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:47,884
-No, now you're whining.

2269
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:49,018
Don't complain in the scream.

2270
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,354
Threaten me with it.

2271
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:53,056
God knows you have enough
anger to start World War III.

2272
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:54,624
-What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Jo?

2273
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,025
-Oh, that's it.

2274
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,328
The scumbag prick in person.

2275
01:09:58,428 --> 01:09:59,263
-Yeah, but that's just mean.

2276
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,096
-Exactly.

2277
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,966
-I just-- I need something else.

2278
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,468
You know, it needs-- it needs.

2279
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,437
I got to have the right
prop or something.

2280
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,907
I know what I need.

2281
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:12,542
Silk boxer shorts.

2282
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,877
De Niro wore them in
"The Untouchables."

2283
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:17,781
-You don't have
silk boxer shorts.

2284
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,284
-Get me a pair of
your babydolls.

2285
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:21,084
-Steve.

2286
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:22,252
-Your babydolls, Jo.

2287
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:23,653
-They're not going to fit you.

2288
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,589
-Jo, just do it.

2289
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:26,490
Don't make a face.

2290
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,291
Help me.

2291
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:28,091
All right?

2292
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:28,958
I'm asking for help.

2293
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,261
-Why don't you just try acting.

2294
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:32,061
Acting.

2295
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:32,862
-I am acting.

2296
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,997
-What a concept.

2297
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:35,665
-Acting consists of a
lot of things, honey.

2298
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,134
-Do you want the pink
ones or the red ones?

2299
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,603
-Try the red ones, Daddy.

2300
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:41,571
They're more masculine.

2301
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:42,539
-Honey.

2302
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:43,340
-All right.

2303
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,008
Marching back to bed.

2304
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:46,009
Marching down the hallway.

2305
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:48,312
Turning off the light.

2306
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:49,112
Under the covers.

2307
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:49,646
-Ugh.

2308
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,046
-I love you.

2309
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:50,747
Bye.

2310
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,616
[door closing]

2311
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:05,194
-Yeah.

2312
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:07,697
This feels like something.

2313
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:09,198
This is good.

2314
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:10,700
This is good.

2315
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,068
This is good, honey.

2316
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:14,003
What do you think?

2317
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:14,804
Huh?

2318
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:15,472
-Steve.

2319
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:16,039
-What do you think?

2320
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:17,574
It's not Steve.

2321
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:19,008
It's Al.

2322
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,344
Al.

2323
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,579
And if you're nice to me,
later I'll show you my scars.

2324
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,914
Muah.

2325
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:25,882
-Oh.

2326
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:27,751
-Yeah.

2327
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:28,718
Yeah, baby.

2328
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:29,953
This is a start of something.

2329
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:30,920
Yeah, baby.

2330
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,721
Yeah.

2331
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:32,522
Yeah.

2332
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,390
What do you think?

2333
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:34,190
This will work.

2334
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,325
This will work.

2335
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,667
Oh, god.

2336
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:44,634
-Janey's bird pot.

2337
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:47,437
-I, I got carried away.

2338
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:48,237
-What happened?

2339
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:49,172
-Nothing, honey.

2340
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:50,106
-Mommy, what's wrong?

2341
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:51,441
-We got-- it was an accident.

2342
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:52,241
-Oh, Steve.

2343
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:52,909
Oh.

2344
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:53,477
-An acting accident.

2345
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:54,277
-Oh, god.

2346
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:55,579
-Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

2347
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,382
-You know, it's times
like this that you really

2348
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:01,050
have to admit to yourself
that you have a dream.

2349
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,920
That maybe you're just
like every other fool

2350
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,256
who came to this town.

2351
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:09,158
-You're not l everybody else.

2352
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,564
-What do you dream about, Daddy?

2353
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,365
-Hey, girls.

2354
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:16,433
What are you doing up?

2355
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,501
-I'm thirsty.

2356
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:18,702
-Oh, come here.

2357
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:19,503
Poor baby.

2358
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,945
-I can't see any stars, Daddy.

2359
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:30,414
There's too much smog.

2360
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:31,648
-No, no, no, look.

2361
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:32,449
Look, look.

2362
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:33,383
See over there in the West?

2363
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:34,183
Venus.

2364
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:35,318
That's Venus, see?

2365
01:12:35,419 --> 01:12:37,253
See that big thing there
that looks like a star?

2366
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,722
That's Venus.

2367
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:39,689
-Cool.

2368
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:42,626
You'll be great tomorrow, Dad.

2369
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:44,093
Don't worry.

2370
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,062
HANNAH: And no more rehearsing.

2371
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,031
Take the morning off.

2372
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,174
-Guys, nine holes on me.

2373
01:12:58,274 --> 01:12:59,275
I insist.

2374
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,877
A little gift to show
how much I love you.

2375
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,345
ARMAND: Thanks, Johnny.
That's very big of you.

2376
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:02,779
-Johnny.

2377
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:03,713
-What?

2378
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:05,248
-Your audition is
this afternoon.

2379
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:06,416
Do you think this
is the best idea?

2380
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:06,850
-Yeah.

2381
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,917
Yeah.

2382
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,118
That's this afternoon,
but this morning I

2383
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:09,819
want to relax and play
some golf with my friends.

2384
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:10,820
Screw it.

2385
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:17,360
Look who I'm talking to, the
three extras from "The Piano."

2386
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:19,829
Will you guys tattoo some
smiles on those faces?

2387
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:20,630
STEVE: Absolutely.

2388
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:27,937
Nice.

2389
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:29,906
DORIAN: Very nice.

2390
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,975
ARMAND: Must be your lucky day.

2391
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:32,776
STEVE: No, you go.

2392
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:33,577
You go second.

2393
01:13:33,677 --> 01:13:34,844
I don't like going second.

2394
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,480
DORIAN: You always go second.

2395
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,413
STEVE: And I always hate it.

2396
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:38,848
Will you please just go today?

2397
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,183
DORIAN: Why are you
telling me this now.

2398
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:41,117
You've always gone second.

2399
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:42,151
Go second.

2400
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,186
STEVE: General, I'm
just tired of you

2401
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:44,087
telling me what to
do all the time, OK?

2402
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:44,988
DORIAN: OK.
I won't tell you.

2403
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,557
Just go second.

2404
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:48,357
-Johnny?

2405
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:53,663
Johnny, where you going?

2406
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,098
DORIAN: Johnny.

2407
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,034
-Johnny, what are you doing?

2408
01:13:58,134 --> 01:13:59,603
-Rudy Ptak.

2409
01:13:59,703 --> 01:14:02,872
You son of a bitch.

2410
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:03,740
-Johnny.

2411
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,342
How the hell are you doing?

2412
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,744
Jeez, I look in your face.

2413
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,746
It's like-- like
looking in a mirror.

2414
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:10,880
We're incredibly handsome.

2415
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:11,314
-Yeah.

2416
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,248
Yeah.

2417
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:13,016
We look like a
couple of bouncers

2418
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:14,083
at a teamsters convention.

2419
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,051
-Ha-ha.

2420
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,920
This is my agent
here, Sean Nusbalm.

2421
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,722
-Yeah, hi.

2422
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:20,824
-So, uh-- hey, congratulations.

2423
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:22,559
I heard you got a TV
series in New York.

2424
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:23,359
-Yeah.

2425
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,460
Yeah.

2426
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:25,161
Well, you know, just
a little bit of luck.

2427
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:26,029
-Yeah.

2428
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:27,063
So what are you doing out here?

2429
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:27,897
-I'm auditioning.

2430
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:30,166
It's just some thing, you know?

2431
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,901
-Yeah, I know.

2432
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:35,138
It's Capone, isn't it?

2433
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:38,542
-It's not your business what
roles I go up for, John.

2434
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:40,510
-Not my business?

2435
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,512
Every time I turn around,
you're in my face.

2436
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:43,680
What do you got,
somebody telling

2437
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,114
you what I'm going up for, huh?

2438
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,115
Are you clocking me?

2439
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,083
-What's he nuts or something?

2440
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:47,884
What's he doing here?

2441
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:48,518
-Oh, no, no.
That's it.

2442
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:49,452
No.

2443
01:14:49,553 --> 01:14:50,854
He's got somebody
tipping him off.

2444
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:51,688
That's it, right?

2445
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:52,121
-Johnny.

2446
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:52,556
-Right?

2447
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:53,222
Really.

2448
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:53,923
Who is it, a friend?

2449
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,258
This guy?

2450
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:57,761
-Maybe he's, uh-- maybe he's
just a better actor than you.

2451
01:14:57,861 --> 01:14:59,362
-Oh, hey.

2452
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:01,197
-Oh, really?

2453
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:02,532
Oh, look, the suit talks.

2454
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:04,167
What are you drinking here, pal?

2455
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:04,968
Some actor's blood?

2456
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:06,570
-You're way off-base here.

2457
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,904
Now, back off before
something happens.

2458
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,038
Back off.

2459
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:10,774
-Ooh, tough guy, huh?

2460
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:11,975
Oh, good anger, Rudy.

2461
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:13,843
The trouble is I'm not scared.

2462
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,111
You're not going deep enough.

2463
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,079
-Yeah.

2464
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:17,146
You're going to tell
me about deeper.

2465
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,247
Mr. Over-the-Top himself?

2466
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,649
-Over the top?

2467
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:20,449
-Hey.

2468
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:21,150
-Hey. hey.

2469
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:21,951
-Hey, Johnny.

2470
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:22,886
-Johnny.

2471
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:23,853
[interposing voices]

2472
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:24,821
-No biting.

2473
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:30,493
-Hey, hey, hey.

2474
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:31,294
-Calm down.

2475
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:32,261
-Stop it.

2476
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,697
Look at what you're--

2477
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:36,165
[interposing voices]

2478
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,734
RUDY: I think he bit my ear.

2479
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:38,702
-Jesus.

2480
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:40,036
God, Rudy.

2481
01:15:40,136 --> 01:15:41,337
I, I lost it.

2482
01:15:41,437 --> 01:15:42,338
I don't know what got into me.

2483
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:43,139
Rudy, I'm--

2484
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,407
RUDY: You're a maniac.

2485
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:44,974
-Hey.

2486
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:46,375
-It's all right.

2487
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,711
-You know how many roles-- you
took just as many roles from me

2488
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:48,645
as I took from you.

2489
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:49,445
-I did?

2490
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,114
-Yes, you did.

2491
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,849
The cabby in "Baywatch."

2492
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:55,418
And-- and there was
that-- the stalker

2493
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:57,353
in the Lizzy Wagner movie.

2494
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:58,922
No, maybe it was a gynecologist.

2495
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:01,625
The point is, everywhere I
look, I see your face, too.

2496
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:02,425
JOHNNY: Rudy.

2497
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,226
All right, Rudy.

2498
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:04,027
I'm sorry, Rudy.

2499
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:04,828
I don't know what it is.

2500
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:05,929
It's just this part, man.

2501
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:07,196
It's got me crazy.

2502
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:07,797
-All right, all
right, all right.

2503
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:08,431
-All right?

2504
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:08,965
-I know.

2505
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,099
-All right.

2506
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,367
-I heard there's only
a few of us up for it,

2507
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:14,137
but the new word I hear is
that the list is growing.

2508
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,038
-Yeah.

2509
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:18,207
Your pals are on the list, too.

2510
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,043
-Oh my god.

2511
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:21,778
-I have no idea what
he's talking about.

2512
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,046
SEAN: What do you mean?

2513
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:24,147
I saw your names myself.

2514
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,115
Both of you have
appointments this afternoon.

2515
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,392
-Johnny.

2516
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:37,393
My agent got me up for it.

2517
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:39,362
I swear to god I was
going to tell you.

2518
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:40,429
-Johnny.

2519
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,230
Johnny, I--

2520
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,298
DORIAN: I'm sorry.

2521
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:44,267
-I have always wanted
to meet Scorsese.

2522
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,770
This was a golden
opportunity for me.

2523
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,104
I-- I'm very sorry.

2524
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:56,512
Hey.

2525
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,313
Johnny.

2526
01:16:57,413 --> 01:16:57,914
What the hell?

2527
01:16:58,014 --> 01:16:58,848
Johnny.

2528
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,685
-Johnny.

2529
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:02,852
[interposing voices]

2530
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,053
-Somebody call a doctor.

2531
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:05,388
-He's turning blue!

2532
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:06,189
-Doctor!

2533
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:07,023
-Hey, do something.

2534
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,892
-I'm out of the service area!

2535
01:17:08,992 --> 01:17:10,159
-Where do you hit him?

2536
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,327
-Where the heart is?

2537
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:13,162
DORIAN: Call a doctor.

2538
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:13,963
[phone ringing]

2539
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:14,931
-Hello.

2540
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:15,732
Hi.

2541
01:17:22,906 --> 01:17:25,008
What?

2542
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,810
-I don't care what it
took to set it up, Harry.

2543
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,411
Cancel the damn addition.

2544
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:29,545
No, you're not hearing me.

2545
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,579
Do it.

2546
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,181
-I should go to hell
for all eternity.

2547
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:34,984
I almost wish I
believed in that stuff.

2548
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:35,785
-Oh, it's OK.

2549
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,854
I'll go for both of us.

2550
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:39,322
Hannah, I should have told you.

2551
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:40,289
I'm--

2552
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:41,590
-Will you stop,
both of you, please?

2553
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:42,892
You're not responsible for this.

2554
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:43,893
He is.

2555
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,363
And I am.

2556
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:50,900
All those years of cream
sauces and Caesar salads.

2557
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,402
And cheesecake and cannolis.

2558
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,372
And Thai dumplings.

2559
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:57,340
-Oh, Han.

2560
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,842
Don't do this to yourself.

2561
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:00,810
-Oh my god.

2562
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:01,811
I'm starving.

2563
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:14,057
-Hi, honey.

2564
01:18:14,157 --> 01:18:14,958
-The audition.

2565
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:15,825
What time is it?

2566
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,093
-Johnny, please.
Sit back down.

2567
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,061
You're not going anywhere.

2568
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:19,228
You're sick.
STEVE: That's his voice.

2569
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:19,896
I hear his voice.
-Jesus, Hannah.

2570
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:20,897
What happened?

2571
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:21,865
What?
-Just take it easy.

2572
01:18:21,965 --> 01:18:22,832
STEVE: I got to talk to him.
Johnny.

2573
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:23,833
Johnny.
Thank god you're all right.

2574
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:24,700
I'm so sorry.

2575
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,169
I didn't want to
hurt you, buddy.

2576
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:27,236
-Johnny, thank god.

2577
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:29,172
I wanted to die myself
after what I did.

2578
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:29,973
-What is this?

2579
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:30,673
Am I dying?

2580
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:31,507
-No, no.

2581
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:32,441
-Jeez, Hannah.

2582
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,743
What's happening?
What's going on?

2583
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:34,543
-It's OK.

2584
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,045
Now, listen to me.

2585
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:37,146
They took a lot of tests.

2586
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:39,648
They're still not quite sure.

2587
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:42,351
They think you had
a mild heart attack.

2588
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,121
-Oh, [speaking italian].

2589
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,355
-It could have been a lot worse.

2590
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,723
You are still here.

2591
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,158
That's all that matters.

2592
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:49,959
-Oh, Hannah.

2593
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,260
It happened.

2594
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,161
It finally happened.

2595
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:53,662
-Honey, it's going to be OK.

2596
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:54,463
I know it.

2597
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,299
I do.

2598
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:57,400
-The kids, do they know?

2599
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,201
-No.

2600
01:18:58,301 --> 01:18:59,535
They're still at school.

2601
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:01,004
-And Pop?

2602
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:02,105
-Went to the track.

2603
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,039
He's not home yet.

2604
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:04,007
-Oh, Jesus.

2605
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:06,843
-Johnny, we canceled
the audition.

2606
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:09,078
We don't want to go to
any auditions without you.

2607
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:11,580
-Buddy, I got bit
by the envy monster.

2608
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,049
It consumed me.

2609
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:16,953
-You too?

2610
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:23,793
You should have just
told me, that's all.

2611
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,394
You're my best friends.

2612
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,696
My family.

2613
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:30,033
What's happening to us?

2614
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:30,834
And for what?

2615
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,168
For fame?

2616
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,870
Fortune?

2617
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:37,506
Are we willing to throw
away everything for it?

2618
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:41,644
Maybe that's just the
way it's supposed to be.

2619
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:44,013
Nothing more.

2620
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,016
But in the end, my kids will
remember me as the hit man

2621
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:50,486
on "NYPD Blue."

2622
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:51,720
-Oh, sweetheart.

2623
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:52,521
-No.

2624
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,422
-Johnny.

2625
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:54,323
-No, Johnny.

2626
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:54,991
-No.

2627
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:55,691
Johnny, no, no, no.

2628
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,359
Johnny.

2629
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:57,060
-You're just tired.

2630
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,394
You'll be fine.

2631
01:19:58,494 --> 01:19:59,662
-Oh.

2632
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,431
-Excuse me.

2633
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,068
We've had quite a
day, haven't we?

2634
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,535
-[inaudible].

2635
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,171
-You'll have to excuse us now.

2636
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,611
-Well, that's it.

2637
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:16,545
I'm quitting acting.

2638
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,714
I'm getting the hell out.

2639
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,950
-What about me?

2640
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:22,718
I actually tried to
sabotage his performance.

2641
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:23,552
I'm out of control.

2642
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,455
My whole life is a sham.

2643
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,690
-Your whole life?

2644
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,592
What are you talking about?

2645
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:30,393
-Oh, nothing, honey.

2646
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:31,194
I'm just nuts.

2647
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:39,602
-Look, I, uh-- I know we got
a lot of stuff to talk about.

2648
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:40,904
But this happened and--

2649
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:42,338
-No, that's OK.

2650
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:45,641
Listen, I've made a decision.

2651
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:47,877
I've decided to take
the job in Seattle.

2652
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,345
It will be a good change.

2653
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:53,416
And you and I will have time
apart to think things through.

2654
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:54,217
-Wait a second.

2655
01:20:54,317 --> 01:20:55,718
When did you decide this?

2656
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:58,054
Don't I have anything
to say about this?

2657
01:20:58,154 --> 01:20:58,888
-Of course.

2658
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:01,190
Say anything you want.

2659
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:01,991
-Um--

2660
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:10,499
HANNAH: No!

2661
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,567
What are you--
JOHNNY: Get these things off me.

2662
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:12,902
HANNAH: You cannot do that.
Stop.

2663
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:14,137
-It was gas.

2664
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:15,338
Gas.

2665
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:17,673
From the burrito I
ate this morning.

2666
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:18,874
It mimicked a heart attack.

2667
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:19,675
Where are my clothes?

2668
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:21,110
Where are my clothes?

2669
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,545
-Will you just listen--

2670
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:23,512
-No, there's time.

2671
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:24,313
There's time. no.

2672
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:25,114
Gas.

2673
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:25,614
Gas.
Thank you.

2674
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,482
Thank you.

2675
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,451
Thank you.

2676
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:31,387
And you're all forgiven,
you bunch of shits.

2677
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:32,855
Now, where's [inaudible]?

2678
01:21:32,956 --> 01:21:34,323
I need my clothes.

2679
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:35,324
-Johnny.

2680
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:36,292
-Johnny.

2681
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,293
HANNAH: Stop it.

2682
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:37,760
Stop running.

2683
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,561
-Oh, food.

2684
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:39,428
Thank you.

2685
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:40,229
Thank you.

2686
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:41,697
-Give me that.

2687
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:43,166
-Life is precious.
Hang in there, pal.

2688
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:44,333
-Honey.
You're coming off a sedative.

2689
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:45,134
You're not yourself.

2690
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:46,602
-I've never been more myself.

2691
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:49,072
Don't you see, sweetheart,
how beautiful everything is.

2692
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:51,707
The universe wants
me at this audition.

2693
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:52,508
-Great.

2694
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:53,309
He's going holy on us.

2695
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,343
-It's a miracle.

2696
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:55,811
- --perfect Capone.

2697
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,780
Harry, Harry, it's Dorian.

2698
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,747
Listen.

2699
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,216
Dorian.

2700
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:02,085
Look, did you cancel
the audition, Harry?

2701
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:04,720
Good, because I'm
going in after all.

2702
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,688
-You snake.

2703
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:06,889
After everything
we've been through,

2704
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,191
you're still going
in on that audition?

2705
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,225
-Fucking A I'm going in.

2706
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:10,359
It was-- it was an accident.

2707
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:11,627
It was a false alarm.

2708
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:12,761
He forgave us, didn't he?

2709
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,197
You should go back in, too.

2710
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,168
You son of a bitch, you
didn't cancel, did you?

2711
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,103
-I couldn't cancel it.

2712
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:20,936
-What the--

2713
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:22,471
-My cousin got me the audition.

2714
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:24,107
-What the hell was going
to be the criteria?

2715
01:22:24,207 --> 01:22:25,108
A coma, you go in?
A death, you cancel?

2716
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,014
What?

2717
01:22:31,114 --> 01:22:34,117
I'll kill you.

2718
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:35,718
You broke my cellphone.

2719
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:36,552
JOHNNY: Look at this day.

2720
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:37,353
What a beautiful day.

2721
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,754
Where's that car?

2722
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:40,023
I love that car.

2723
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,390
-Listen to me, if we are
going to do this, I'm driving.

2724
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,191
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I love you.

2725
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:42,758
I love you.
I love you.

2726
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:43,559
-Johnny, listen.

2727
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:44,994
Did you mean what you said?

2728
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,862
You forgive us?

2729
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,798
-Stevie, my tortured friend.

2730
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,168
I wish you could love yourself
the way others love you.

2731
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:55,771
The world would be your oyster.

2732
01:22:55,871 --> 01:23:00,209
And Dorian, my deceiving,
guilt-ridden pal,

2733
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,610
cherish this moment.

2734
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,046
Give her babies.

2735
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:03,979
-All right, Johnny.

2736
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,780
OK.

2737
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,485
And Armand, you.

2738
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,487
You have more character
in your pinkie

2739
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,489
than most men have
in their entire mind.

2740
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:15,558
You knew it all, didn't you?

2741
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,161
Dorian and Steve going for
the part, Theresa running

2742
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:22,131
the audition, and still
you remained loyal?

2743
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,766
-You're my hero, Armand.

2744
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:35,010
-Break a leg, Johnny.

2745
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:36,011
-All right.

2746
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:37,546
-Knock them dead.

2747
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:38,347
-Thank you.

2748
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:39,148
Thank you.

2749
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:40,116
-Bye.

2750
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:40,916
-Good luck, buddy.

2751
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:41,717
-Bye.

2752
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,454
-All right.

2753
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:47,156
-Why did Johnny say you were
deceiving and guilt-ridden?

2754
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:52,061
-Armand, what is it?

2755
01:23:56,099 --> 01:23:58,501
-My Theresa handled
the audition.

2756
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,653
-Hey, Tommy.

2757
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:20,156
You help me and I help you.

2758
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:25,027
Two neighborhood guys make
good, gumba and a mick.

2759
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:27,096
But now you want to
get elected again,

2760
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:28,964
put some distance between us.

2761
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,367
Hey, I understand.

2762
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:33,802
I know the game.

2763
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:38,040
But this, calling
me names in public,

2764
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:40,243
saying bad things
about my people

2765
01:24:40,343 --> 01:24:41,344
when we get you in office.

2766
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:45,514
Hey, I know it's an act, huh?

2767
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:46,949
Put on a little show.

2768
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,817
What the hell?

2769
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,052
I'm the bad guy.

2770
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:51,220
You're the good guy.

2771
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,422
Put a little
distance between us.

2772
01:24:57,025 --> 01:25:00,263
But you show me respect.

2773
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:02,931
If you don't, I'll kill
your whole fucking family.

2774
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:05,368
Blow their brains all
over the sidewalk.

2775
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:10,573
I'll start with that pretty,
little wife of yours.

2776
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:12,007
Hey, I know, pal.

2777
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,310
I'm just protecting my own.

2778
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,645
So now we understand each other.

2779
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:20,749
You play your part, I play mine.

2780
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,151
And we'll all be out
there with bells on.

2781
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:23,118
I promise.

2782
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:32,328
I'll see ya after the election.

2783
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:37,933
Oh, and give my regards
to Evelyn and the kids.

2784
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:38,734
-Good, Johnny.

2785
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,303
Great.

2786
01:25:40,403 --> 01:25:41,237
Very good.

2787
01:25:41,337 --> 01:25:42,037
Very good.

2788
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:42,938
Very, very good.

2789
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:43,739
Thank you.

2790
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:44,540
-Thank you.

2791
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,908
Thank you very much, sir.

2792
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:49,111
THERESA: Thank you, Johnny.

2793
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:51,013
-That was pretty good, you know?

2794
01:25:51,113 --> 01:25:51,814
-Mm-hmm.

2795
01:25:54,517 --> 01:25:56,419
-Hey, I-- I know it's an act.

2796
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,654
We all got to put on a show.

2797
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:00,189
What the hell?

2798
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:03,392
You're the god guy
and I'm the bad guy.

2799
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,794
And you want to put some
distance between us.

2800
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,565
But you show me some respect.

2801
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:13,236
If you don't, I'll kill
your whole fucking family.

2802
01:26:13,336 --> 01:26:16,205
I'll blow their brains
out all over the sidewalk.

2803
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:20,243
I'll start with that pretty,
little wife of yours.

2804
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:24,447
Pal, I am just
looking after my own.

2805
01:26:24,547 --> 01:26:25,481
OK?

2806
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:30,152
So now we understand each other.

2807
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:33,289
You do your part, I'll do mine.

2808
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:35,324
And we'll be there
with bells on.

2809
01:26:35,424 --> 01:26:36,124
Promise.

2810
01:26:39,962 --> 01:26:43,266
I'll talk to you
after the election.

2811
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:47,002
Regards to Evelyn and the kids.

2812
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:48,604
-Good.

2813
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:49,405
It's really good, Steve.

2814
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:50,205
Thanks.

2815
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:51,640
It's really-- it's good.

2816
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,875
Very good.

2817
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:54,009
That was good.
THERESA: Mm-hmm.

2818
01:26:54,109 --> 01:26:54,843
-Thank you, Steve.

2819
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,011
THERESA: Yeah, thank you, Steve.

2820
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,151
-What the hell?

2821
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:07,523
I'm the bad guy and
you're the good guy.

2822
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:15,298
Sure, put some
distance between us.

2823
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:16,899
But show me respect.

2824
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:23,171
If you don't, I'll kill
your whole fucking family.

2825
01:27:23,272 --> 01:27:25,741
I will blow their brains
out all over the sidewalk.

2826
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:30,679
And I will start with
that pretty wife of yours.

2827
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:33,716
Hey, I know, pal.

2828
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:36,084
I'm just protecting my own, too.

2829
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:38,887
OK, so now we
understand each other.

2830
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,924
You play your part, I play mine.

2831
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:45,594
And we will both be out
there with bells on, promise.

2832
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:49,632
I will talk to you
after the election.

2833
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:53,101
Give my regards to
Evelyn and the kids.

2834
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:57,740
-Good, Dorian.

2835
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,874
Very good.

2836
01:27:58,974 --> 01:27:59,775
Very good.
THERESA: Yeah.

2837
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:00,309
Oh, yeah.

2838
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:00,809
-Excellent.

2839
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:01,344
Excellent.

2840
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:02,044
-Thank you.

2841
01:28:02,144 --> 01:28:02,978
Thank you.

2842
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:03,979
You-- you want to
go another way?

2843
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:05,814
We could try a little,
uh, something--

2844
01:28:05,914 --> 01:28:06,882
-No, no, no.

2845
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:07,750
That was-- that was fine.
It was great.

2846
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,250
-OK.

2847
01:28:08,351 --> 01:28:09,051
Thank you.

2848
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:12,054
I-- I'm a big-- thanks.

2849
01:28:12,154 --> 01:28:13,956
-Yeah.

2850
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:15,624
-Thank you.

2851
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:19,462
-Uh, other way.

2852
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:20,896
-Thanks.

2853
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:23,966
Um, do you validate for parking?

2854
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:24,900
-Um, I don't know.

2855
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,134
Do we validate or what?

2856
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:27,269
THERESA: I don't know.
-Ask the kid.

2857
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:28,571
There's a kid outside, ask him.

2858
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:29,405
-All right.

2859
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:30,739
I'll ask.

2860
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:33,175
-Did you feel good about
that note I gave you?

2861
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:34,242
-It was so right on.

2862
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:35,077
-It was?

2863
01:28:35,177 --> 01:28:35,578
-Yeah.

2864
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:36,144
Because--

2865
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:36,912
-That felt good.

2866
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:37,813
You did well, huh?

2867
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:38,647
-Yeah.

2868
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:39,081
You?

2869
01:28:39,181 --> 01:28:39,582
-Yeah.

2870
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:40,082
It was OK.

2871
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:40,883
It was OK.

2872
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:41,850
-Wild, huh?

2873
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:42,351
-Yeah.

2874
01:28:42,451 --> 01:28:43,151
Oh, yeah.

2875
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:51,460
-How you guys doing?

2876
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,495
-Hey, Rudy.

2877
01:28:52,595 --> 01:28:54,430
What do you say?

2878
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:55,631
Rudy, my wife, Hannah.

2879
01:28:55,731 --> 01:28:59,001
Rudy Ptak.

2880
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:00,903
-How you doing?

2881
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:01,704
-So how'd it go?

2882
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:02,971
-It was, uh, good.

2883
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:04,139
I-- I think.

2884
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,841
You?

2885
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:06,809
-Uh.

2886
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:08,844
-Are you-- are you
feeling all right?

2887
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:09,645
-Yeah.

2888
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:10,513
You?

2889
01:29:10,613 --> 01:29:11,313
-Yeah.

2890
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:19,488
No business like show business.

2891
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:21,123
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

2892
01:29:21,223 --> 01:29:21,924
See you around.

2893
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:22,725
JOHNNY: You too, Rudy.

2894
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,062
-Dorian.

2895
01:29:27,162 --> 01:29:28,831
-Babette.

2896
01:29:28,931 --> 01:29:29,765
-Hi, babe.
-Hey.

2897
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:30,833
What-- what are you doing here?

2898
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:31,700
-I'm reading for Scorsese.

2899
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,935
My agent got me in.

2900
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:33,736
-That's great.

2901
01:29:33,836 --> 01:29:34,803
That's great.

2902
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:36,905
Babette, this is my,
um, wife, Samantha.

2903
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:40,743
Sam, this is Babette from the
Victory Boulevard Playhouse.

2904
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:43,512
We did the Mamet
Showcase together.

2905
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:45,180
-Really?

2906
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,084
Um, what play?

2907
01:29:49,184 --> 01:29:50,486
-"Death Trap."
-"American Buffalo."

2908
01:29:50,586 --> 01:29:51,286
-"Glengarry."

2909
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,356
-"Streamers."

2910
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:55,323
Well, bye.

2911
01:29:58,961 --> 01:29:59,662
-What?

2912
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:03,599
Honey, she's an old friend.

2913
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:04,399
We work together.

2914
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,568
She-- she's an actress.

2915
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:08,571
She's overly demonstrative.

2916
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:09,404
ARMAND: Where's Therese?

2917
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:10,506
ASSISTANT: What are you doing?

2918
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:11,440
Who are you?
ARMAND: Don't worry about it.

2919
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,407
It's not your concern.

2920
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:13,375
Now, where is she?

2921
01:30:13,476 --> 01:30:14,543
-No, you don't have
an appointment.

2922
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:15,511
-Armand?

2923
01:30:15,611 --> 01:30:16,178
ASSISTANT: She
can't be disturbed.

2924
01:30:16,278 --> 01:30:17,112
She's in a session.

2925
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:18,046
-Yeah, she's going
to be disturbed.

2926
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:18,681
-Armand?
ASSISTANT: Wait a minute.

2927
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:19,482
Listen.

2928
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:20,849
-Armand.

2929
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:22,350
ASSISTANT: I told you,
you can't go in there.

2930
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:24,687
I'm sorry, this
maniac just barged in.

2931
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:25,488
I didn't--

2932
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:26,288
-Armand.

2933
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:27,389
-What are you doing?

2934
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:29,057
ASSISTANT: I told him
he couldn't come in.

2935
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:29,958
-Everybody, back off.

2936
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:30,759
-Oh my god.

2937
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:31,760
-Everybody just back off.

2938
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,795
Back away.
MAN: What's going on here?

2939
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:33,796
-Come on.

2940
01:30:33,896 --> 01:30:34,897
Come on, we got a
private audition.

2941
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:35,330
-How would you like a
private ass-kicking?

2942
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,731
-Whoa.

2943
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:36,164
Hey.

2944
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:36,965
-Armand.

2945
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:38,000
-Hey, I'm auditioning here.

2946
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,301
-Your audition is over, friend.

2947
01:30:39,401 --> 01:30:40,368
Sit down.

2948
01:30:40,469 --> 01:30:41,604
JOHNNY: Armand,
what are you doing?

2949
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:42,505
-Don't call me that.

2950
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:43,606
That's not my name anymore.

2951
01:30:43,706 --> 01:30:45,207
I am finished with all that.

2952
01:30:45,307 --> 01:30:46,542
Everybody, sit down.

2953
01:30:46,642 --> 01:30:50,145
You do not want
to make that call.

2954
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:50,979
WOMAN: Sit down.

2955
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:52,581
Do what he says, please.

2956
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:53,816
-OK, OK.

2957
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:55,618
Whatever your name is,
what's in the suitcase, pal?

2958
01:30:55,718 --> 01:30:58,353
-None of your business, pal.

2959
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,657
Everybody just sit down.

2960
01:31:01,757 --> 01:31:02,858
Hey.

2961
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,928
What did I just tell you,
sit down and stay put.

2962
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:12,267
All of yous.

2963
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:18,574
Look at you, think you're
so smart with your slick,

2964
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:22,144
show biz lives, spitting
out one lie after another.

2965
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,582
Give me that chair.

2966
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:38,794
You have any idea
what it's like to be

2967
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:41,630
typecast your whole life, huh?

2968
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:44,032
To have people
smile in your face,

2969
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:47,269
but behind your back whisper,
oh, watch out for him?

2970
01:31:47,369 --> 01:31:49,905
You know who his family is?

2971
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:52,975
Or what it's like to
be a kid and elicit

2972
01:31:53,075 --> 01:31:55,644
fear from grown people?

2973
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,479
A kid does not
want to be feared.

2974
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,314
He wants to be loved.

2975
01:31:59,414 --> 01:32:02,050
But fear is what
you grow up with.

2976
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:03,351
It's the air you breathe.

2977
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:06,655
And soon, you
cultivate that fear.

2978
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:10,492
You learn to look someone in the
eyes and just make them shake.

2979
01:32:10,593 --> 01:32:12,260
It's pathetic.

2980
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,697
Those whispers still hurt.

2981
01:32:14,797 --> 01:32:16,665
Smiles and whispers.

2982
01:32:16,765 --> 01:32:17,833
Smiles and whispers.

2983
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:20,202
You know it splits
you right in half.

2984
01:32:20,302 --> 01:32:22,137
You walk around with--
with stitches going

2985
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:25,073
down right the
center of your body.

2986
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:27,710
But then you discover
that there are people

2987
01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:31,580
in this world who have
it every which way.

2988
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,583
Yeah, they play all the roles.

2989
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:39,121
And they are loved for it
because they are our magicians.

2990
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:42,557
They are our sorcerers.

2991
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:43,826
And then you start
to think, hey,

2992
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:47,963
I could do that because
I understand both sides.

2993
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,598
I am both sides.

2994
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:52,935
So destiny takes a little
turn, it breaks the chain,

2995
01:32:53,035 --> 01:32:57,806
and then you leave
your family and you

2996
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,709
venture out into
this big, new world.

2997
01:33:03,345 --> 01:33:05,547
Now, this is a
very special world.

2998
01:33:05,648 --> 01:33:08,283
It's got big dreams in it, hm?

2999
01:33:08,383 --> 01:33:10,853
You had those dreams, right?

3000
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:14,456
You almost tasted the
glory that awaits you.

3001
01:33:14,556 --> 01:33:15,624
But it's never the right day.

3002
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:16,558
It's never the right moment.

3003
01:33:16,659 --> 01:33:18,526
And it's never the right part.

3004
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:23,198
And then you realize that
it's a punishment for all

3005
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:26,168
the bad things you did
in your other life.

3006
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:30,873
We lived together.

3007
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,474
I was godfather to your son.

3008
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:37,145
-Armand, I didn't
want to hurt you.

3009
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:39,848
-Well, this is a lie.

3010
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,483
You are all liars.

3011
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:45,854
And I-- yeah, I am
a fool because I

3012
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:48,891
am a traitor to my family.

3013
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:52,194
But I have learned
my lesson very well.

3014
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:56,164
This son is going to return
to his family with pride

3015
01:33:56,264 --> 01:34:03,872
and ferocity and a gesture
that will make my father proud.

3016
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:05,140
Hey, you.

3017
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,408
Will you sit down?

3018
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:17,052
I relish this moment
because in this moment

3019
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:22,991
I reclaim my father's respect
and I make myself whole again

3020
01:34:23,091 --> 01:34:26,729
in the eyes of
god and the devil.

3021
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:35,103
And Dad, [speaking italian].

3022
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:38,606
May this fuse us in
our ancestral glory.

3023
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,648
Yeah, Dad.

3024
01:34:46,749 --> 01:34:52,587
Let's show them what
they fear the most.

3025
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:55,557
[screaming]

3026
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:09,972
-Oh, god.

3027
01:35:20,749 --> 01:35:21,449
-Huh?

3028
01:35:24,186 --> 01:35:24,887
-I'm available.

3029
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:36,899
All you got to do is
call my agent, 555-1635.

3030
01:35:36,999 --> 01:35:38,200
-You mean you're not that guy?

3031
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,902
-No, I'm not that guy.

3032
01:35:40,002 --> 01:35:43,471
And, uh, my father's
a Toyota dealer.

3033
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,273
-Oh.

3034
01:35:45,373 --> 01:35:46,141
-It's the truth.

3035
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,609
Nobody believes me.

3036
01:35:55,951 --> 01:35:57,786
-OK.

3037
01:35:57,886 --> 01:35:59,554
-Crazy actors.

3038
01:35:59,654 --> 01:36:02,457
You're going to hear from
my lawyer, you little prick.

3039
01:36:02,557 --> 01:36:04,126
-Jesus Christ, you need therapy.

3040
01:36:11,834 --> 01:36:12,534
-Honey.

3041
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:23,411
-I want a divorce.

3042
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:33,822
-Jesus, are you
out of your mind?

3043
01:36:33,922 --> 01:36:35,357
Have you lost it completely?

3044
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:38,693
-No, I just want to know
why you didn't call me in.

3045
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:39,694
-What?

3046
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:43,131
-Theresa, why did
you pass me over?

3047
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,767
You're one of my oldest
friends in the world.

3048
01:36:45,868 --> 01:36:46,869
Just say it, will you?

3049
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:48,236
Just once.

3050
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:49,637
Right to my face.

3051
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:53,008
Why didn't you call me in?

3052
01:36:53,108 --> 01:37:02,117
-Because you weren't
right for the part.

3053
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,975
OK, let's hear it for
Yolanda and Armand.

3054
01:37:27,075 --> 01:37:30,913
May you share joy and happiness
for the rest of your lives.

3055
01:37:31,013 --> 01:37:34,382
[applause]

3056
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:39,187
-Salud.

3057
01:37:39,287 --> 01:37:42,524
-Well, uh, I got to say being
here with, uh, my lovely,

3058
01:37:42,624 --> 01:37:47,095
uh-- my lovely,
ooh-- my lovely wife.

3059
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:50,532
And all of you makes me feel
like for the first time maybe

3060
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:53,735
in my whole life I am
right where I ought to be.

3061
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:56,071
[applause]

3062
01:37:58,073 --> 01:38:00,775
-And, um, to all of our
great friends, some of whom

3063
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,744
invested in this
very restaurant,

3064
01:38:02,844 --> 01:38:08,083
that my husband-- oh my god, I
can't believe I'm saying that.

3065
01:38:08,183 --> 01:38:12,454
My own personal husband
is the proud owner of.

3066
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,422
Thank you, guys.

3067
01:38:14,522 --> 01:38:17,359
[applause]

3068
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:22,264
-Dad.

3069
01:38:22,364 --> 01:38:23,098
Can I call you dad?

3070
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:24,299
-I'd love you to call me dad.

3071
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,301
-At last we meet the
mysterious family.

3072
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:30,072
-We're so happy he
married a Spanish Asian.

3073
01:38:30,172 --> 01:38:32,140
-What is that jacket?

3074
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,141
Salmon?

3075
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:34,943
-It looks like a
maitre d from the Copa.

3076
01:38:35,043 --> 01:38:36,211
Here, give me a $20 quick.

3077
01:38:36,311 --> 01:38:37,145
We'll get a table.

3078
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:40,415
-I'm the father of the groom.

3079
01:38:40,515 --> 01:38:42,050
-No.

3080
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:42,850
-That's funny.

3081
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:44,752
A lot of people do that.

3082
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:47,922
But you know what I thought
when I saw you, I said, Camry.

3083
01:38:48,023 --> 01:38:49,291
That's what I said to myself.

3084
01:38:49,391 --> 01:38:50,258
Call me.

3085
01:38:50,358 --> 01:38:52,427
I'll give you a good
deal on a Camry.

3086
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:56,398
Talk to me personally, not to
that bastard brother of mine.

3087
01:38:56,498 --> 01:38:57,365
Ah, here you go.

3088
01:38:57,465 --> 01:38:58,166
Frank Minetti.

3089
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:00,268
-Thank you, Frank.

3090
01:39:00,368 --> 01:39:02,737
-Bye.

3091
01:39:02,837 --> 01:39:04,072
-I still think he's connected.

3092
01:39:04,172 --> 01:39:05,473
-Will you stop with that?

3093
01:39:05,573 --> 01:39:07,042
You're going to give
Johnny gas again.

3094
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:08,176
-Very funny.

3095
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:10,012
That audition ended
Armand's acting career

3096
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:12,414
and nearly cost me my
life, right, Therese?

3097
01:39:12,514 --> 01:39:13,881
-Oh, come on, Johnny.

3098
01:39:13,982 --> 01:39:14,849
Don't remind me.

3099
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:15,517
OK?

3100
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:16,718
ARMAND: Oh, Therese.

3101
01:39:16,818 --> 01:39:18,420
The one casting person who
genuinely loves actors.

3102
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,521
-Yeah.

3103
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:22,157
Well, she's dated about
a thousand of them.

3104
01:39:22,257 --> 01:39:23,358
-Yeah.

3105
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,193
And every one of them
would have been more right

3106
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,294
for Capone than you or Dorian.

3107
01:39:26,394 --> 01:39:27,095
-Ooh.

3108
01:39:27,195 --> 01:39:29,664
God, I love you.

3109
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:30,598
-You should.

3110
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:31,633
At least now you have a career.

3111
01:39:31,733 --> 01:39:32,434
-Yeah.

3112
01:39:32,534 --> 01:39:33,735
What were those roles?

3113
01:39:33,835 --> 01:39:36,138
It was the, uh-- the shady
lawyer that got disemboweled

3114
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:38,906
and the shady lawyer
that got impaled.

3115
01:39:39,007 --> 01:39:42,077
-And the compassionate
doctor who's head exploded.

3116
01:39:42,177 --> 01:39:43,245
Hey, they pay me.

3117
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:44,046
I work.

3118
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:44,946
Right, honey?

3119
01:39:45,047 --> 01:39:45,380
Muah.

3120
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,081
-Muah.

3121
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:47,082
Can you believe this?

3122
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:48,983
He's blowing me kisses.

3123
01:39:49,084 --> 01:39:52,854
I can't decide what's
weirder, the new, wild Steve

3124
01:39:52,954 --> 01:39:56,424
or the old, depressed one.

3125
01:39:56,524 --> 01:39:57,225
-Hey.

3126
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:58,660
How are you, honey?

3127
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:59,661
-Good.

3128
01:39:59,761 --> 01:40:01,096
It's so good to see you.

3129
01:40:01,196 --> 01:40:02,264
-Doing OK?

3130
01:40:02,364 --> 01:40:03,531
-Hi.
Congratulations.

3131
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:04,499
I'm sorry [inaudible].

3132
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:06,934
-You all right?

3133
01:40:07,035 --> 01:40:08,770
-Can you believe that, Johnny?

3134
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:09,571
She's carrying my kid.

3135
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,574
She still won't talk to me.

3136
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:13,541
WOMAN: So Johnny?

3137
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:14,509
-Yeah.

3138
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:15,943
-Who'd they finally
cast as Capone?

3139
01:40:16,044 --> 01:40:17,145
-Uh, we don't like
to discuss that.

3140
01:40:17,245 --> 01:40:18,280
WOMAN: No, come on.

3141
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,647
Who'd they cast?

3142
01:40:19,747 --> 01:40:20,448
-Keanu Reeves.

3143
01:40:20,548 --> 01:40:21,316
-Keanu Reeves?

3144
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:26,554
-That's right, the studio
wanted to go another way.

3145
01:40:26,654 --> 01:40:28,323
-No, the studio wanted a name.

3146
01:40:28,423 --> 01:40:29,524
JOHNNY: Yeah, I know.

3147
01:40:29,624 --> 01:40:31,093
Scorsese thought they
were nuts, so Keanu's in.

3148
01:40:31,193 --> 01:40:32,427
Scorsese's out.

3149
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:33,761
-Wait, wait, wait, what?

3150
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,731
The kid from the bus, he's
going to play Al Capone?

3151
01:40:36,831 --> 01:40:37,932
-I like Keanu Reeves.

3152
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:40,535
-Go meet somebody.

3153
01:40:40,635 --> 01:40:41,636
Keanu Reeves?

3154
01:40:41,736 --> 01:40:43,105
-Can you believe this
[inaudible], Mr. M?

3155
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:46,108
Capone, the elementary
school years.

3156
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,276
-Who understands show business?

3157
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:51,779
-(SINGING) Still searching
out my destination.

3158
01:40:55,517 --> 01:40:58,086
I just got back from all--

3159
01:40:58,186 --> 01:41:01,356
-Steve. -(SINGING) --from
all around the world.

3160
01:41:01,456 --> 01:41:02,757
-You OK?

3161
01:41:02,857 --> 01:41:03,725
-Yeah, I'm fine.

3162
01:41:03,825 --> 01:41:04,992
I got it all.

3163
01:41:05,093 --> 01:41:08,062
Except for maybe a good
cannoli every now and then, eh?

3164
01:41:08,163 --> 01:41:09,631
I love that tofu.

3165
01:41:25,713 --> 01:41:27,582
-Hey, Johnny.

3166
01:41:27,682 --> 01:41:29,584
-Hey, [inaudible].

3167
01:41:29,684 --> 01:41:30,552
-Hey, Hannah.

3168
01:41:30,652 --> 01:41:31,553
How are you?
You look great.

3169
01:41:31,653 --> 01:41:32,520
-Hey, uh, [inaudible].

3170
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:33,321
Did you hear?

3171
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:37,925
The Palm is doing Mussolini.

3172
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:38,760
You're perfect.

3173
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:39,561
Check it out.

3174
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:48,170
-What are you doing?

3175
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:48,970
-Hm?

3176
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:51,105
No, no.

3177
01:41:51,206 --> 01:41:51,906
Nothing.

3178
01:42:03,551 --> 01:42:04,252
-Sorry.

3179
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:14,095
-Honey, what are you doing?

3180
01:42:14,196 --> 01:42:15,263
You all right?

3181
01:42:15,363 --> 01:42:16,063
-Yeah.

3182
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:22,170
-What else?

3183
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:24,506
-Mr. Mussolini.

3184
01:42:24,606 --> 01:42:27,775
-Mr. Call me Benito.

3185
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:28,643
-Oh, please.
