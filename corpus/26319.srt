1
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,690
Always considering
the best interest...

2
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,568
. . .and well-being of the child.

3
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,840
Therefore, you may make visitation. . .

4
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,729
. . .every other week
and Christmas Eve. . .

5
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,768
. . .and on Easter Sunday,
wearing your pretty Easter outfits.

6
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,078
Your honor, my ex-husband is addicted
to pills and he's a thief!

7
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,203
Because of his record, I lost
my job as a secretary for the FBl.

8
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,010
He was the finest high-school
tailback I ever saw.

9
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,761
Of course he's had his run-ins
with the law, but he's. . .

10
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,205
. . .made his accommodations
with the authorities.

11
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,919
Being an informer
for the vice squad. . .

12
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,162
. . .hardly qualifies him
to raise a seven-year-old!

13
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,560
Neither does being
a mother without a job!

14
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,085
But I lost it because of him!

15
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,563
Little lady. . .

16
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,601
. . .my decision is final.

17
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,489
Next case.

18
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,685
The big man's here!

19
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,484
-When does she go on?
-Pretty soon, Jerry.

20
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,688
-Welcome to Eager Beaver, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

21
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,088
Keep it close.

22
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,289
-Keep it very close.
-You got it.

23
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,281
Last stop, okay?

24
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,688
-What do you say, congressman?
-Poontang.

25
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,484
The night is young
and full of promise, my boy.

26
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,089
Great!

27
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,326
Now look, this has to be
the last one. Now I told--

28
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,279
Come on!
We got a rehearsal tomorrow.

29
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,690
Melissa thinks I'm in temple.
What if she calls?

30
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,360
We've got the legendary
twin temples from Fort Lauderdale.

31
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,685
Miss Urbana Sprawl wrapping up
on the great stage.

32
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,286
Nice spot, isn't it, Erb?

33
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,208
It's very uplifting, sir.

34
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,279
-Jerry, the usual Evian with lime?
-Please.

35
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,318
>From Paris, France. . .

36
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,562
. . .put it together
for the fabulous Monique, Jr. !

37
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,282
Oh, my God. I love you!

38
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,406
That song is killing me!

39
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,040
Those babies gonna wind up in traction,
you don't play some ballads.

40
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,444
God, it's freezing!

41
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,689
They could store meat in here.
In fact, they do store meat in here.

42
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,841
No, I've been trying all day!

43
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,881
Are you positive?

44
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,529
No, thank you.

45
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,523
-Can't reach her?
-Darrell's phone's out of order.

46
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,319
I just know he's moved with her
again to some new dump.

47
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,640
God, what a nightmare!

48
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,081
He drives around with her in that van.
Drinking, taking pills. . . .

49
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,685
He doesn't even think about
putting a seat belt on her.

50
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,728
He's a dirtbag!
You hang in there, honey.

51
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,119
You'll get Angela back.

52
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,928
That judge will see the light.

53
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,320
It's expensive light,
I'll tell you that.

54
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,686
It's gonna cost me $1 5,000
for this appeal.

55
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,563
Is there even a chance
I can make that in six weeks?

56
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,683
You'll have to dance day and night
and hope some Arab sheik shows up.

57
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,684
I love you, girls, I do. But I can't
work here when I go back to court.

58
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,883
"Your honor, I found a new job.
I'm working at the Eager Beaver. "

59
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,485
It's honest work.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

60
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,087
I know that and you know that.
But the judge won't.

61
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,882
Not him.

62
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,568
God, I still get nauseous
before I have to go out there.

63
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,358
You'll get over it.

64
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,083
Really? I can't imagine that.

65
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,081
You guys having a good time?

66
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,564
Here's the lucky guy!

67
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,199
You've come to the right place.
Monique!

68
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,088
Look at these hunks!

69
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,962
We're having a party!

70
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,484
Keep an eye on them bachelors.

71
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,163
They look like real trouble.

72
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,960
It's time to strap yourselves in
because you are going for a ride!

73
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,243
In her eighth week here. . .

74
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,721
. . .put your hands together
and make her feel good.

75
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,609
For the one, the only Erin Grant!

76
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,920
How about that!

77
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,525
-Larry King's at table six.
-What's he wearing?

78
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,608
-Tank top and gold chains
-That's Larry, all right.

79
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,999
-How do I look?
-Better than me.

80
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,844
That ain't easy.
You talk to her?

81
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,890
Darrell's phone's out of order.
I think he moved again.

82
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,122
I'd embrace the opportunity
to maim his white ass up.

83
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,486
That's really thoughtful, but I
don't think it'd help me in court.

84
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,568
Erin, come on.
I can't have an empty stage.

85
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,203
Man, let the chumps wait!

86
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,042
Going to the head.

87
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,842
You'll behave?

88
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,368
An angel appeared.

89
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,128
An angel of pure delight.

90
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,918
Go, Paul!

91
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,923
I'm getting married
this weekend to Melissa.

92
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,525
You love her?

93
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,159
-Very much.
-Then go home to her.

94
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,488
Shad!

95
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,488
Shad!

96
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,000
Listen up! The Flesh Farm
is killing us and you know why?

97
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,445
-They have free buffalo wings.
-Their girls are hookers.

98
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,885
No, because their girls dance fast.

99
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,644
And fast means sweat.
And sweat. . .

100
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,119
. . .means drinking!

101
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,805
Oh, my God!

102
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,566
What was that?

103
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,729
I got this.

104
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,161
Coming through.
Move out of the way.

105
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,003
Way to go, Davey!

106
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,888
Back up! Back the hell up!

107
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,608
-You all right?
-Fine. How about this guy?

108
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,882
Good thing he was drunk.
You could've gotten hurt.

109
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,678
On the main stage,
our lost little pussycat.

110
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,327
Put your hands together for the one,
the only Miss Sabrina Hepburn!

111
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,162
Meow!

112
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,130
I leave you alone for five minutes!

113
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,203
Will you get in?
Watch your foot, stupid.

114
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,681
Malcolm's gonna shit a brick.
Thank you.

115
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,119
Did I touch any girls?

116
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,884
Not this time,
but you were recognized.

117
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,001
Okay? Happy?

118
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,884
-How are you, little angel?
-I'm fine, thank you.

119
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,888
-Kids just tear me up.
-She's a brave one.

120
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,206
You'll be in my prayers.

121
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,486
God bless you, ma'am.

122
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,485
Last stop, little 'un.

123
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,479
Daddy, you're mean!

124
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,608
Evers and Jennings.
This is the new model, the X1 2.

125
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,598
-You're happy?
-Oh, mucho happy.

126
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,081
-Mucho happy?
-Get in the van.

127
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,928
Mucho, mucho, mucho !

128
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,884
Get in. We're in a loading zone.
We don't wanna break the law.

129
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,850
Daddy, did you tell Mommy
that we moved?

130
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,080
Of course I did, buttercup.

131
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,609
Of course I did.

132
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,688
How about a wine cooler, Erin?

133
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,403
I got mango, passion fruit--

134
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,279
Water would be just fine,
Alberto. Thanks.

135
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,722
Rita, the reason I stopped by
is Darrell's moved again. . .

136
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,961
. . .and I need his new phone number.

137
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,960
Yeah? Well, you come
to the wrong place.

138
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,088
I hardly sleep nights
and then I break out into--

139
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,960
Look, Erin, I got no idea
where our brother is, okay?

140
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,888
Shit! They got the cat!

141
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,324
Wolves got no restraint.

142
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,879
-Careful, sweetie.
-Shut up!

143
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,761
She's all caught up with them cubs.

144
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,721
Some of the guys down
at the nuclear plant. . .

145
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,009
. . .they were asking me
if you'd do, like. . .

146
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,689
. . .private parties.

147
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,359
I don't think so.

148
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,646
Oh, that's a shame.

149
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,485
Because I'll bet that
you are a great dancer.

150
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,727
Alberto, I'll go crazy if
I don't get Darrell's new number.

151
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,848
I promised Angie I would
call her every day and--

152
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,324
I hear he moved, Darrell.

153
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,049
Alberto, where is he?

154
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,766
You have to ask Rita about that.

155
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,758
He calls here about twice a week.
Collect.

156
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,126
Need money, as usual. . .

157
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,928
. . .but he don't speak to me.

158
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,207
Got no respect for me
even though I am. . .

159
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,680
. . .a professional man.

160
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,526
You're looking real good.

161
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,681
Oh, God, I've got such a headache.

162
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,648
Oh, yeah?
You want some Advil?

163
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,286
That would be so great.

164
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,883
Well now, you sit right here.

165
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,361
I'm gonna fix up
that mean old headache.

166
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,686
Never mind. I've gotta run,
but thanks anyhow.

167
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,443
Deerfield Beach?

168
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,325
We had a good day, baby.

169
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,686
Phone's ringing.
Think it's Mama?

170
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:03,281
No, little 'un. I talked to her
and she's too busy to call you.

171
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,645
Damn him!

172
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,640
Nice leg.
Maybe I'll take it home.

173
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,999
I recommend you let go.

174
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,968
Here's 500, baby.

175
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,159
What'd you say?

176
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,525
What's with Princess Di tonight?

177
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,000
Her husband disappeared
with the kid again.

178
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,089
I don't suppose you'd
accept this in appreciation.

179
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,683
No need.

180
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,683
Senor Cucaracha
here is gonna make me rich.

181
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,125
Oh, my God!

182
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,689
Is that a roach?

183
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,723
No, it's a fucking shrimp.
Move, you're in my light.

184
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,483
Get some manners, mister!

185
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,808
So this is the new brainstorm?

186
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,123
The Wall Street journal says
this is the hottest-selling yogurt.

187
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,485
I'll bring this in. . .

188
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,324
. . .say my hair fell off
from the shock. Boom.

189
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,128
They pay off bigtime.

190
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,326
Lawyer thinks it's a genius idea.

191
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,289
Your lawyer has an office
over a video store.

192
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,361
Call me a dreamer.
I don't wanna be a bouncer forever.

193
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,921
Erin! Note from Jerry!

194
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,681
What did it say?

195
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,286
"Dearest Erin: I can help you
get your daughter back.

196
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,288
I ask nothing in return
but a kind smile. "

197
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,485
Yeah, right!

198
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,486
He's a weirdo.

199
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,324
You guys!
He is totally harmless.

200
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,639
Come on!

201
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,166
"Also, could you add
Kenny G to your routine?

202
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,287
Anything from his Christmas album. "

203
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,724
That's sweet.

204
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,767
We could do a Christmas show here!

205
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,287
Seriously, it couldn't hurt
to talk to him, right?

206
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,648
-Only talking, no touching.
-Ladies! Attention!

207
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,520
-Major announcement.
-Major asshole.

208
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,919
I heard that.

209
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,321
On Monday, I'm installing a ring.

210
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,326
Mud wrestling?

211
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,800
This is something
that's really happening.

212
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,927
It's contemporary. It's now.

213
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,320
And it's creamed-corn wrestling.

214
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,764
-Corn?
-Corn wrestling?

215
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,449
That's disgusting!

216
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,289
I'm not putting these in corn.
No way!

217
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,327
What?
No, it's terrific!

218
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,322
In lsrael, we did falafel wrestling.

219
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,323
All the girls broke out
in hives everywhere.

220
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,923
And I mean, everywhere!

221
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,400
Well, falafel, sure.
This is corn!

222
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,278
-What is this, a mutiny?
-I don't think so.

223
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,882
No chance that I'm gonna roll
around naked in creamed corn. . .

224
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,526
. . .with drunken yahoos trying
to stick niblets up my hoo-hah.

225
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,330
Not naked. Topless.

226
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,720
Health Department won't go for naked.

227
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,039
Not with food products.

228
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,281
I always liked the Health Department.

229
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,679
So you'll think about it?

230
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,443
-Not for one second.
-Erin!

231
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,520
Please!

232
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,607
You're getting a big following here.

233
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,205
Even with that shit music,
the guys love you.

234
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,848
You go into the corn, you set
a great example to the other girls.

235
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,046
I got it!

236
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,720
How about pasta wrestling?

237
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,005
Now, that's classy.

238
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,526
Linguine, rigatoni?
Just nothing with meat or fish.

239
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,123
Orly, if I wanted to wrestle. . .

240
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,282
. . .I would've joined
the World Wrestling Federation.

241
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,448
-And speaking of real class?
-What's the problem?

242
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,480
We hate these.

243
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,688
They degrade women and beavers.

244
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll take it under advisement.
But just the coasters and the napkins.

245
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,005
Not the sign.
That's a landmark!

246
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,282
Good night, darlin' .

247
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,925
For you, Miss Grant.

248
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,086
They're beautiful, Jerry.
Thank you.

249
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,325
You can call me Erin--

250
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,800
I can't.
I worship you too much.

251
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,928
Believe me. . .

252
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,286
. . .I'm no one to be worshiped.

253
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,321
I'm just trying to make a living.

254
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,889
I worship your essence.

255
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,239
If you were a nurse or a teacher,
I'd feel the same.

256
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,605
You receive my note?

257
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,003
I did and, you know, I was wondering
what you had in mind.

258
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,088
I believe I can help you
get your daughter back.

259
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,844
I believe I can
get to Judge Fingerhut.

260
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,364
-How?
-Through. . .

261
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,319
. . .a certain congressman who
I'm certain will listen to me. . .

262
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,808
. . .because I know some things.

263
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,323
Things? Really?

264
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,880
Well, you know what, Jerry?
You're really a terrific guy. . .

265
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,803
. . .and so supportive of me
ever since I started here.

266
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,483
Maybe you shouldn't--

267
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,882
Just give me a week.

268
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,369
Good night, my precious.

269
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,887
Melissa thinks I was in synagogue
the night this happened.

270
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,728
What do I tell her?

271
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,485
You left synagogue and a gang
of skinheads jumped you.

272
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,483
In the meantime, we'll develop these,
we'll see what we have.

273
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,881
I see mucho damages. These strip
joints are insured up the ass.

274
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,285
My neck really feels better,
Uncle Al.

275
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,929
Oh, yeah?

276
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,488
How's it feel now?

277
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,562
Call Little Caesar's.

278
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,085
Order me a health pizza.
Get some for yourself.

279
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,922
No, thank you, sir.
I'm dieting.

280
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,479
I'll just grab a yogurt
out of the fridge.

281
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,888
This is a major disaster!

282
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,968
Major. Unbelievable.
Without doubt. . .

283
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,482
. . .the most asinine piece
of human behavior.

284
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,721
It's never gonna
happen again, Malcolm.

285
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,528
I've got it under control.

286
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,479
You see. . .

287
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,722
. . .I just love naked women.
It's a character flaw.

288
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,959
God's testing me--

289
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,122
Oh, will you shut up!
You idiot.

290
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,925
You can't talk to me like that.
I'm a U.S. congressman.

291
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:56,926
I can't?

292
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,645
You go psycho in a titty bar
six weeks before the election.

293
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,081
What should I call you?
Winston fucking Churchill?

294
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,485
It was all I could do to keep. . .

295
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,405
. . .Willie Rojo from strangling you
with his bare hands.

296
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,924
Everybody has a bad night.

297
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,685
If you're under pressure like we are,
under the public eye--

298
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,081
Who recognized me?

299
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,283
His name. . .

300
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,481
. . .is Jerry Killian.

301
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,887
And he's waiting outside.

302
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,886
Now?

303
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,884
Now. We gotta move on this
before we get eaten alive.

304
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,125
Move on what?

305
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,089
If this is a shakedown,
get Willie to pay them like always.

306
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,369
-Why drag me into it--
-Because it's not about money.

307
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,646
-It's not?
-No.

308
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,323
He wants you to persuade
Judge Fingerhut. . .

309
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,279
. . .to reverse a child custody case
for some stripper.

310
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,239
Who he's porking?

311
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,448
It's disgraceful to have
a man like me deal with--

312
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,479
He's not porking her.

313
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,761
Well, then, why does he care?

314
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,080
Because he's nuts!

315
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,484
That's why he's dangerous.

316
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,928
If he was porking her, at least
I could deal with him man to man. . .

317
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,762
. . .but this is fruitcake love.

318
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,483
I mean, Fingerhut's a democrat.
He won't listen to me.

319
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,363
You can't say that
to this little creep, Davey.

320
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,681
You gotta string him along.

321
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,482
Bullshit him.

322
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,761
Use the old. . .

323
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,722
. . .Dilbeck charm.

324
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,123
What if he doesn't go for it?

325
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,645
Then we have a serious problem.

326
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,888
Mr. Killian!

327
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,602
Come in and meet
Congressman Dilbeck.

328
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,449
I'll bet that's Jerry Killian.

329
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,488
Lucy!

330
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,083
Come here.

331
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,483
Come on.

332
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,285
How perfect is this?

333
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,080
You know, I was just thinking. . .

334
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,679
. . .is this really on
the same planet as Miami?

335
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,681
I can read.

336
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,728
Where's Andy?

337
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,609
He's been fishing since eight.

338
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,283
Dad!

339
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,089
Dad!

340
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,239
There's a floater!

341
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,922
He's still got his glasses on.

342
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,283
Go tell Mom to call the police.

343
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,284
-You're the police.
-I'm the Miami police.

344
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,401
We just need the local law here.

345
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,083
Go on.

346
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,884
Man!

347
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,367
Of all the lakes. . .

348
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,886
. . .in all the counties. . .

349
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,489
. . .in all the world. . .

350
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,685
. . .you gotta float up in mine.

351
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,009
You son of a bitch.

352
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,923
Mama!

353
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,528
Hey, come here!

354
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,681
I've been trying to reach you, baby.

355
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,398
Heard you stole my sister's mail!

356
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,481
That's a federal offense.

357
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,284
Wait for Mommy.
I'm gonna go talk to Daddy.

358
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,807
Why do you keep moving?
How will she make any friends?

359
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,369
Aren't we the child psych--

360
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,607
It has nothing to do with child
psychology, you moron!

361
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,329
Where's she going to school?

362
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,085
Opa Locka? Deerfield Beach?
Have you even thought about it?

363
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,925
Yeah, I thought about it plenty.

364
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,881
Hey, you only got two hours!

365
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,843
That's what the judge ruled
right there from that bench!

366
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,878
I'll be right behind you just in case
you're thinking about snatching her!

367
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,684
Mommy, does "snatch" mean "kidnap"?

368
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,286
How did you get so smart?

369
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,681
Is Free Willy back yet?

370
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,683
Still out.

371
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,049
People are pigs.
Sit on movies like they own them.

372
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,401
Freak.

373
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,479
It's Shad. Open up.

374
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,722
It wasn't me. It was a temp.

375
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,528
Where's Perry Mason?

376
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,683
Our good friend, Mr. Shad!
Come on in, we have lots to discuss.

377
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,682
No shit.

378
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,565
If I buzz twice, you say my mother's
on the line. She has chest pains.

379
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,204
What do you mean
he's a wheelchair salesman?

380
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,566
There's one nice thing about hospitals.

381
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,564
A lot of kids in chairs are
really sick, and I wave at them. . .

382
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,040
. . .and they smile
just like on jerry Lewis.

383
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,720
-And do you do this every day?
-On Fridays I stay with Aunt Rita.

384
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,043
That's a wholesome environment.

385
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,729
She has real wolves.

386
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,359
I don't want you
touching those animals.

387
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,805
They're not like dogs.

388
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,123
Time.

389
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,722
Time.

390
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,805
I love you more than
anything in the world.

391
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,722
You know that in your heart.

392
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,678
-Mommy?
-What, baby?

393
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,120
Do you know those dolls you got me?

394
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,164
Daddy says he can't
find them anywhere.

395
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,366
We'll get you new ones.

396
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,483
-I love you.
-Bye, baby. I love you.

397
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,924
Hey, let's go!

398
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,323
All right, you go on.
I'll bring your stuff.

399
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,804
Hey, baby!
Did you have a good day?

400
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,129
Good.

401
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,088
She told me about your new profession.
Really admirable.

402
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,479
At least I ain't naked.

403
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,924
"At least I ain't naked"?

404
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,166
You get caught using
that child in a felony. . .

405
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,925
-. . .and Family Services will put her--
-No way I'd get caught.

406
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,519
Got me one of them doctor's
jackets and a stethoscope.

407
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,442
Look like one of them dudes on ER.

408
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,126
Darrell, would you think
for once in your life?

409
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,527
I don't need no stripper
telling me how to behave.

410
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,001
I'll see you in two weeks.

411
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,723
You ready?

412
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,639
You know where that was taken?

413
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,523
Your mama's birthday party.

414
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,002
The Eager Beaver.
Can you identify those people?

415
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,760
Yeah, this old fool. Erin.

416
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,199
Erin's the stripper?

417
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,446
What'd you say?

418
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,122
Erin's the stripper.

419
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,326
Dancer, fat ass.

420
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,964
She's a dancer!

421
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,359
The young man who was
so savagely beaten. . .

422
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,919
. . .is my client, Paul Guber.

423
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,366
No shit. Too bad for him.

424
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,359
I don't think so.

425
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,124
The third person in that photo
is none other than. . .

426
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,844
. . .David L. Dilbeck.

427
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,729
So what?

428
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,919
Do you follow politics, Mr. Shad?

429
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,560
Do I look like I follow politics?

430
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,960
David Dilbeck is
the U.S. congressman. . .

431
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,088
. . .from the fifth district.
He's up for reelection soon.

432
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,320
You gonna put the squeeze on him.

433
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,488
Nice.
What that gotta do with me?

434
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,325
I'll give you 10% of the squeeze.

435
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,238
Is this conceivably
as big as the yogurt deal?

436
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,123
"As big"?

437
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,407
Congressman Dilbeck is chairman
of the subcommittee on sugar, okay?

438
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,925
The Rojo family cannot
allow him to lose.

439
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,686
Because their price supports are worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

440
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,602
And quite frankly, Mr. Shad. . .

441
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,329
. . .this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

442
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,358
Good.

443
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,604
Just keep Erin out of it.

444
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,879
I'll do my best.

445
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,842
She's out. Erin is out.
Erin who?

446
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,079
Charming spot.

447
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,968
Look. Steven Spielberg's house.

448
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,123
I wish he'd come in here.
I'm sure he would have big hots for me.

449
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,968
You'd turn his whole life around.

450
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,362
Steven Spielberg's shower. Can you
imagine me and him in that shower?

451
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,125
-Oh, that cute little beard!
-Yours or his?

452
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,049
Hey, Jerry, it's Erin Grant.
What a long beep.

453
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,121
Someone's waiting for you.

454
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,002
Maybe you're out of town. . . .

455
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,004
I'm just calling to see about
that legal matter we discussed.

456
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,322
If you get a chance,
just give me a call at the club.

457
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,128
Thanks, bye.

458
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,199
-Michael Jordan's at table eight!
-Great.

459
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,647
Say hello to
the fantastic Monique, Jr. !

460
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,763
Lieutenant Garcia with homicide.

461
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,523
What's he want with Erin?

462
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,442
Got no idea.

463
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,408
All I need is scandal.

464
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,402
What do you know about Prozac?

465
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,288
It makes you happy.
There's side effects.

466
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,566
Like what?

467
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,760
Limp noodle.

468
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,929
Who cares?

469
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,526
I haven't had a hard-on
since I started running this place.

470
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,928
Closest I got was Sea World.

471
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,720
Porpoise got me hot.

472
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,929
What the fuck
you telling me that for?

473
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,927
I'm going next door.
See what Ling's up to.

474
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,122
Drowned?

475
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,164
Oh, my God.

476
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,322
He had pictures of you
all over his apartment.

477
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,928
He was a really big fan.
He used to bring me flowers--

478
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,128
He was just a fan?
There was no touching?

479
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,968
This has been a real pleasure.

480
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,967
I dance so I must turn tricks.

481
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,685
Nice way to open a conversation.
"l understand you're a hooker?"

482
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,040
You don't work in a library here.

483
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,287
I'm trying to figure out
the man's life.

484
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,122
He was a customer.

485
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,043
That's all I know about his life.
Except that it's over.

486
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,928
I apologize.

487
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,242
Sincerely. Look, I'm real--
I'm nowhere on this.

488
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,799
I could use some--
Please give me a minute?

489
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,365
Please?

490
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,078
-So where did this happen?
-Lake Okeechobee.

491
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,085
It's where I made the serious
mistake of taking my vacation.

492
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,126
Your family?

493
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,600
Nice.

494
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,118
It's not the kind of place
you'd expect to encounter a homicide.

495
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,128
-Homicide? You said he drowned.
-No, we did an autopsy.

496
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:23,205
The water in his lungs,
they come up clean.

497
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,008
There was tap water in his lungs?

498
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,006
Exactly.

499
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,765
Somebody killed him, like in a bathtub,
then dumped the body in a lake.

500
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,525
Do you read mysteries?

501
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,685
Up till three months ago,
I worked at the FBI in Miami.

502
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,286
A secretary.

503
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,559
Until I got fired
for having a defective husband.

504
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,928
I'm in a pretty bad custody fight.
Jerry was trying to help me.

505
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,967
>From the shores of the Dead Sea. . .

506
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,360
. . .a decorated nurse
in the lsraeli army. . .

507
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,047
. . .say shalom to
the fabulous Ariel Sharon!

508
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,722
Could we go outside?
I could really use some air.

509
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,524
Oh, Mr. Orly!
What a wonderful surprise.

510
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,045
Nice to be in quality club, eh?

511
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,485
Yeah, if you like freak shows.

512
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,528
Ling! Ling!
Get over here!

513
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,885
Move it!

514
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,443
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

515
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,487
But that's Mr. Chris Rojo. . .

516
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,567
. . .of the sugar Rojos.

517
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,847
Typical of the kind
of rich big shots we get here.

518
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,324
Is this the place
where I met my angel?

519
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,165
I don't know which angel
you're referring to.

520
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,245
A congressman?

521
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,122
You mean a U.S. congressman?

522
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,400
Well, he wasn't specific who it was.

523
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,969
I told him it was bananas. . .

524
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,122
. . .and maybe it was better
that he stayed out of it.

525
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,564
On Wednesday, there was an incident,
a guy with a bottle--

526
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,122
Oh, he was a total whack job.
Drunk out of his mind.

527
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,325
Can you remember,
was Mr. Killian here?

528
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,802
No, not offhand, but maybe.

529
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,520
Think about that and let me know.
Here's all my numbers.

530
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,042
Once again, I apologize.
I mean, for any aspersions.

531
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,921
You wanna make it up to me?

532
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,166
I beg your pardon?

533
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,838
I need a favor.

534
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,206
You've got friends on the vice squad?

535
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,929
They're not my bosom buddies.

536
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,802
My ex-husband's an informant.

537
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,200
It's why this idiot judge
gave him custody.

538
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,327
-Are you joking?
-I wish.

539
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,563
But I was thinking,
if vice dumped him as an informer. . .

540
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,278
. . .when my appeal
came up in six weeks. . .

541
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,442
. . .I could then say
my ex-husband is unfit.

542
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,126
-He's such a criminal--
-Wait a minute. He's a criminal?

543
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,366
Your ex? He's a criminal?

544
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,967
He steals wheelchairs.
Thank you very much.

545
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,721
All right, let me see what I can do.

546
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:12,926
Good night.

547
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,479
You know, not having her around. . .

548
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,048
. . .it's like my heart is missing.

549
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,321
I'm sure.

550
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,128
Let me see what I can do.

551
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,606
Good night.

552
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,923
Good night.

553
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,964
How much you pay them?

554
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,041
I think they're up to $30 a day.

555
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,565
Subtract room and board,
booze and smokes.

556
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,529
You know, who knows?
Maybe they pay us!

557
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,486
-Hell of a business.
-It's the best!

558
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,561
We gotta protect it,
my friend, right?

559
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,925
Son, I've been protecting
your family for 20 years.

560
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,848
You're the greatest, man!

561
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,604
I'm saying, until the election,
no more girls, huh?

562
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,007
Bring your wife down here
for a weekend.

563
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,160
What's her name?
Alice?

564
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,366
Mary Pat. Mary Pat.

565
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,044
Chris, I met an angel.

566
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,565
I mean, she's a dancer.

567
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,159
She's so pure and clean.
Not like the rest of these whores.

568
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,809
-If I could be with her--
-What?

569
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,039
You'd be a good boy?

570
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,282
I'd be perfect. I'd be perfect.
I swear I would!

571
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,248
I would stop going to clubs.

572
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,128
I would stop drinking.

573
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,719
I would just lead
a regular life, you know?

574
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,519
With my wife and a steady mistress.

575
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,278
And I would have a decent life.

576
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,324
So let's do it!
Where'd you see her?

577
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,282
My brain has just turned to shit.

578
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,919
That's why you're in Congress!

579
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,801
You're probably right.

580
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:09,726
Who is it?

581
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,728
It's Lieutenant Garcia.
Is it a bad time now?

582
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,239
No, just a second.
I was rehearsing.

583
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,566
Morning.

584
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,558
I was nearby.
I probably should've call--

585
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,926
No, no, it's fine.
Please come on in.

586
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,329
Thank you.

587
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,368
Can I get you some coffee
or English muffin?

588
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,362
No, no, thanks.

589
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,124
You know, I was thinking. . .

590
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,846
. . .and if I had to guess,
I would say. . .

591
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:46,003
. . .that Jerry was probably there
because he was there most nights.

592
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,889
So do you know anything new?

593
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,564
Actually, I have some good news. . .

594
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,119
. . .and I have some mediocre news.

595
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,882
The good news is Darrell
lost his informant status.

596
00:45:58,930 --> 00:45:59,885
9:00 this morning.

597
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,644
Vice thought his information
was bogus anyway.

598
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,646
This is great! Now in six weeks,
I can go to the judge--

599
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,120
That's the mediocre part.

600
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,080
Judge Fingerhut had a heart attack
early this morning. . .

601
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,087
. . .at a porno theater on Ocean.

602
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,681
-Don't tell me that!
-He was DOA. . .

603
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,727
. . .at Don Shula Hospital.

604
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,326
Anyway, I called around,
and the earliest. . . .

605
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,209
It'll be six months
before your appeal's heard.

606
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,519
The system is all backed up.

607
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,046
I can't allow her to stay
with him for another six months!

608
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,929
There's nothing you can do
from a legal standpoint.

609
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,927
Absolutely nothing.

610
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,522
I understand.

611
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,363
Is today Friday?

612
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,009
Yeah, it's Friday.

613
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,923
I gotta run now.

614
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,326
-How are you?
-All right.

615
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,319
You're wonderful, Mr. Dilbeck!

616
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,442
Shalom, darlin' .
Shalom to you.

617
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,722
Manischewitz!

618
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,245
Congressman.

619
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,246
Alan Mordecai.

620
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,560
-Alan, how you been?
-Fine, sir.

621
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,762
Congressman, I brought
a little souvenir for you.

622
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,559
Obviously, the ramifications of that,
if it were to become public--

623
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,563
-Is this me?
-Yes, I'm afraid so.

624
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,563
If this became public,
it would be devastating. . .

625
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,328
. . .and I'd like to avoid that.

626
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,406
It's her.

627
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,121
It's my angel.

628
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,323
Heel! Slow down!
Heel, will you?

629
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,760
Are you going to your house, Mama?

630
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,648
No, we're going to our house.

631
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,845
For the whole day?

632
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,925
Even better.

633
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,206
Really?

634
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,929
Really.

635
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,842
You snatched me, didn't you?

636
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,485
I guess I did.

637
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,965
You sure did.

638
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,525
Come on, pumpkin.
Zippity-doo-dah.

639
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,080
I didn't know she had a child.

640
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,769
Of course you--

641
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,564
She's divorced, but the husband
has custody. Remember?

642
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,119
She's carrying numerous bags.

643
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,723
That doesn't look like just
a visitation, does it, Erb?

644
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,965
I'll look into it.

645
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,565
Check custody status
of Ms. Erin Grant.

646
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,370
God, give me strength.

647
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,724
What an extraordinary creature.

648
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,725
How perfect in every detail.

649
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,161
Davey, you promised you'd behave
until after the election.

650
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,288
You don't understand.
This is love.

651
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,718
Please.

652
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,963
I won't campaign. . .

653
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,326
. . .until I can possess. . .

654
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,038
. . .her actual velvet self.

655
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,960
In the meantime, I want you
to bring me something.

656
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,280
Something of hers.

657
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:42,764
Something. . .

658
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,887
. . .personal to tide me over.

659
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,165
How personal?

660
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,726
Intensely personal.

661
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:02,964
Am I a good help?

662
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,283
Honey, you are the best
laundry assistant I've ever had.

663
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,008
All right, let's hit the road, Jack.

664
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,239
Who's Jack?

665
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,080
It's just an expression.
Come on.

666
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,362
This is some picture.

667
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:22,606
It's fatal.

668
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,482
I don't accede to blackmail.

669
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,328
Willie, I agree with you
in principle. . .

670
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,203
. . .but this gets out,
we're in a bigtime shitstorm.

671
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,089
Pop, pay the guy off.

672
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,527
You got a cancer,
you talk nice to it?

673
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,399
-No. You cut it out.
-Willie.

674
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,210
We can't operate like
we're in the funeral business.

675
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:47,239
I'd rather buy cops than
pay blackmail. Understood?

676
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,804
I just think we should
consider other options.

677
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,524
Understood?

678
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,723
What else?

679
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,238
A connected matter.

680
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:14,527
Davey wants this stripper,
and I'd like to use the boat.

681
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,330
That way, we can control
the situation.

682
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,448
-She's the girl from the picture?
-That's correct.

683
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,523
-What does she know?
-Well, we gotta find out.

684
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,325
The good news is she got custody
illegally, so she's vulnerable.

685
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,726
Vulnerable isn't good enough.

686
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,723
I say let Davey have his fun.
Then lose her.

687
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,765
Willie, Willie.

688
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,320
First, let's determine
whether she can hurt us or not.

689
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,848
I'm sure she's just
another dumb whore.

690
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,840
For her sake, I hope so.

691
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,641
Phooey! I go back three.

692
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,927
-This is complicated.
-It's easy.

693
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,129
All right, is it your turn?

694
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,242
You stay here with us, sweetie.
Mama's orders.

695
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,526
Everybody, listen up.

696
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,802
This is Lorelei!

697
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,726
Formerly of the Flesh Farm.

698
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,718
She and her snake, Monty Python,
have signed an exclusive. . .

699
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,965
. . .contract with us.

700
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,643
You've got a snake?

701
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:21,723
-Monty.
-And she starts tomorrow.

702
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,366
So why don't we make
her feel at home. . .

703
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,841
. . .and give her a real
Eager Beaver welcome!

704
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,399
Welcome, darling.

705
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,966
I'm Ariel, Miss Gaza Strip.

706
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,523
I'm Tiffany Glass.

707
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,566
-How big is your snake?
-It's big.

708
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,926
So what brings you here?

709
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,965
Just what we needed, another blonde!

710
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,762
What the hell is that?

711
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,046
It just came from Ling's.

712
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,724
Monty sleeps with the fishes.

713
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,968
Lorelei has no idea, right?

714
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,922
No, it just got here.

715
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,529
It's fresh.

716
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,928
Go rustle up a new snake.

717
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,006
Where? The A & P?

718
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,241
Who the fuck carries pythons at 1 0:00?

719
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,641
There's an all-night
snake farm on Route 27.

720
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,562
Ask for Jungle Juan.

721
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:10,879
And get rid of that.

722
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,525
God, I hate this business.

723
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,129
You know why?

724
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,326
It's lost its humanity.

725
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:21,085
-Say hello to one gorgeous creature. . .
-Bring change.

726
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,804
. . .the unbelievable Erin Grant!

727
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:30,358
Because he believes in the family. . .

728
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:33,761
. . .in the values that made us
a God-fearing people.

729
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,246
Because he's long been
a friend of this organization.

730
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,320
Get him out of there.
Preferably with his clothes on.

731
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,249
David--
Oh, my God!

732
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,721
Tell me I'm dreaming. Please.

733
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,923
No, no, no!
I cannot believe this!

734
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:05,806
Davey, no!

735
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,838
Is this lint fresh?

736
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,079
Hot out of the Maytag.

737
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,319
You just can't imagine!

738
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,200
This is the very essence
of that glorious creature.

739
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:22,079
I gotta say, even for you,
Davey, this is off the charts!

740
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,599
Why are you shiny?

741
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,200
It's Vaseline.

742
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,365
It's Vas--
Great. It's Vaseline.

743
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,124
You've never covered yourself
with Vaseline?

744
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,082
Not unless I have third degree burns.

745
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:40,007
You don't know what you're missing.
I've got it all over.

746
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:44,727
It's down in my boots. I can feel
it squishing in between my toes.

747
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,079
All right, okay.

748
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,402
The Young Christians
are waiting so. . . .

749
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,926
-When will I see her?
-It's in the works.

750
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,802
-When?
-It's in the works!

751
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,727
Clean yourself up!

752
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:02,369
I did not go into politics to pimp
for a twisted old fuck like you!

753
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,328
I've had it, Davey.

754
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,529
I quit.

755
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,929
You are such a child.

756
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,760
Onward, Christian soldiers

757
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,969
Marching as to war

758
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,089
With the cross of jesus

759
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,800
Going on before

760
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:35,639
Christ, the royal Master

761
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:39,519
Leads against the foe

762
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,921
Forward into battle

763
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:46,805
See His banners go

764
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,838
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

765
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,321
You are too kind.

766
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:10,960
What a privilege for me to be here
for you good people tonight. . .

767
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,724
. . .and to talk about an issue
that is so critical. . .

768
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,599
. . .to this campaign and
to all of the American people.

769
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:20,325
I'm talking about the issue. . .

770
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,964
. . .of family values.

771
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:42,326
Where's Monty?
He isn't here yet.

772
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,919
He's on his way.
Relax.

773
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,528
Do me a favor and watch Angela?

774
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,159
I'm gonna get my car,
it's pouring out.

775
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,526
-Yeah, sure, gorgeous.
-Thanks.

776
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,282
Where have you been all night?

777
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:02,529
Doing my Christmas shopping early.
Martha Stewart recommends it.

778
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,961
If that's not a snake,
then it's an amazing belt.

779
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:12,319
I gotta find a new line of work.
This shit is getting out of hand.

780
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,925
Let me put this down
and walk you to your car.

781
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,121
I'm fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

782
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,928
-Evening, everybody.
-Shit!

783
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:39,321
-Where's my little 'un?
-Where you can't get her.

784
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:43,328
Is that ever the wrong answer.
Bring her to me now!

785
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,323
I am not bringing her to you
in this lifetime.

786
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,159
I'll go to that judge and tell him
my whore of a wife abducted--

787
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,725
Guess what, Darrell?
The judge is dead.

788
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:54,807
So you'll just have to kill me.

789
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,723
-Go on!
-Think I'm afraid to?

790
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,364
Think I don't have the manliness
to take your life?

791
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,561
I think you are all man.

792
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:07,326
That death row-lethal injection thing?
That's not gonna scare you.

793
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,641
They'd never execute a daddy.

794
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,279
Drop the knife.

795
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,764
You got till three. One.

796
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,849
Suck my dick.

797
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,041
Whip the little fella out. Two.

798
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,645
This here is a domestic squabble.

799
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,838
Three.

800
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,399
You broke my arm!

801
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,043
You sure?

802
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,246
-Bitch!
-Bully!

803
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,246
I'm gonna get you!

804
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,283
-Are you okay?
-Just had a tiff with my ex.

805
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:57,489
I know what that's like.
Did you see? Monty finally got here.

806
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,083
That's great, Lorelei.

807
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,322
Hey, baby. Say hi to Erin.

808
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,044
-Cute.
-Homicide.

809
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,439
Lieutenant Garcia.

810
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,487
She's a kidnapper!

811
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,243
Watch your head there.

812
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,408
The fact is he threatened,
and he did not attempt.

813
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:18,729
What if he kills me?
Can I press charges then?

814
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,285
The law is the law.
I'll screw around here.

815
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:25,648
If you like, I'll lose your paperwork.
He makes bail, she's his.

816
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:31,050
I should split and
take her to New England.

817
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,244
Understand this.

818
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,880
If you split without formal custody,
you'll lose her forever.

819
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,122
I've dealt with Family Services.
They are pencil pushers.

820
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:43,003
-This is by the book.
-I'm dealing with a maniac.

821
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,678
I understand.
I repeat, you can't take off.

822
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,088
You cannot.

823
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,841
You might have a bigger problem.

824
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,165
-I can't have a bigger problem!
-Look at this.

825
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:59,040
Any of these clowns the one
who might have assaulted Mr. Guber?

826
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,046
This clown.

827
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:12,479
You're positive?

828
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,206
Absolutely.

829
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:18,442
Who is he? He looks
like that guy on F Troop.

830
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,327
That's Congressman Dilbeck.

831
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:23,568
This nut is a congressman?

832
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,728
You haven't heard from him?
>From any of his staff?

833
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:30,645
Wait.

834
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:34,045
This is who
Jerry was talking about.

835
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,169
Are you saying I am in danger
from a congressman?

836
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,286
No.

837
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,245
Let me know if you hear
from him though.

838
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,927
I think that's in both our interests.

839
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,841
How did I get so popular?

840
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,884
Hush, little baby
Don 't you cry

841
01:04:55,130 --> 01:05:00,045
Mama 's gonna buy you a something

842
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,567
Pumpkin pie.

843
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,962
Oh, you're awake.

844
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,678
-Can Mommy put you down?
-No.

845
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,443
Fair enough.

846
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,880
-Brush your teeth.
-I'm too tired.

847
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,849
Okay, don't brush your teeth.
Go on to bed.

848
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:43,640
"Mr. Dilbeck requests your company
for a private dance.

849
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:47,525
You'll receive $2,000 cash
for a one-hour set.

850
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:52,440
Discretion and confidentiality
are of the utmost importance. "

851
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,244
Mommy, do you like dancing?

852
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,283
Why are you still awake?

853
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,647
I was just thinking.
Do you like dancing?

854
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,045
Not really.

855
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,559
-It's not fun?
-No.

856
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,008
You're just dancing.

857
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:21,167
Just dancing's fun, honey.
Sure, that part of the job.

858
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,807
What's not fun?
The customers?

859
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:27,002
Urbana said some of them
are mean and stupid.

860
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,685
Pumpkin, have you ever seen me dance?

861
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:36,760
Have you?

862
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,648
-I told the girls that--
-I came out tonight.

863
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,445
While I was dancing?

864
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,882
You looked really pretty.

865
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,724
No, I didn't.

866
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,644
Yeah, you did.
You looked great.

867
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,042
Thank you, baby.

868
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,041
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

869
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:15,003
Welcome to the
Miami Seaquarium 's Top Deck.

870
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:21,199
We are going to celebrate the oceans
and all the living things in them...

871
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:25,523
...as we proudly present to you
a splash of the islands.

872
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,842
Okay, now, I need all
the camp kids to come with me.

873
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:34,129
Come on. You too.

874
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:38,647
It's okay. You can go.
Go on. It's all right.

875
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,245
I'll be right here.

876
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,443
Don't worry.

877
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,639
She's spent so little time with kids. . . .

878
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,444
It'll change.
Once she's with you full-time.

879
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:53,486
I hope so.

880
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:57,848
Let me get this straight.
He offered you two grand?

881
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:00,048
To dance for one hour?

882
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,086
I don't know.

883
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:05,766
I can't turn it down, Al.

884
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:10,162
Now that I have Angie with me,
I've gotta find another job immediately.

885
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,641
Which will pay me nothing
compared to what I'm making now.

886
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,849
But, you know. . .

887
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:19,202
. . .she saw me last night.
Can you imagine?

888
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,009
Was she upset?

889
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:26,441
She said no, but come on.
One day she's gonna realize. . .

890
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:28,368
. . .and say, "That was my mother. "

891
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:35,842
How about you? You ready
to feed Flipper? Step here.

892
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:37,565
Oh, my God.

893
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,844
-It's safe, though, right?
-What?

894
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:43,960
With Dilbeck.

895
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,929
I'm bringing Shad.

896
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:50,169
I think as long as they think you
don't know anything, you'll be fine.

897
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,479
Keep your ears open.

898
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,003
What will you do with her tonight?

899
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,279
Urbana said that she'd--

900
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:58,249
Why don't you drop her
off at our house?

901
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,563
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

902
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:03,608
I told Donna everything.
Your whole situation.

903
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,608
She said if you needed a hand
she'd love to help.

904
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,688
She doesn't think I'm something
out of A Current Affair ?

905
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:13,645
Come on, you're a terrific girl.
You know that.

906
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:17,519
So you made a mistake. You married
a bum. What are you gonna do?

907
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:20,244
You gonna beat yourself up
for the rest of your life?

908
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,849
Well, I usually don't,
but it's. . . .

909
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,848
I mean, it's just that. . .

910
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,365
. . .you know, she saw me dancing.

911
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,325
It'll all work out.

912
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:37,450
I want her free and clear,
whatever it takes.

913
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,242
Good job, baby!

914
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,648
-You're Mrs. Grant?
-No, I'm Barbara Bush.

915
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,160
-Who is he?
-George Bush.

916
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,089
George Bush is not invited.

917
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,160
Take a hike.

918
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,849
Oh, no, no.

919
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,161
See, if he goes, I go.

920
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,246
Raise your hands.
I gotta pat you down.

921
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:33,718
Stop.

922
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,043
Right this way.

923
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:19,881
Hello, Erin.
My name is Congressman Dilbeck.

924
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:23,683
You are--
You're a beauty.

925
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,206
Good evening.

926
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:33,804
I'm Erin Grant.

927
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,127
And you must be. . . .

928
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,447
Convak Dilvak.

929
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,521
Congressman Dildo.

930
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,841
I am Congressman David Dilbeck.

931
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,160
And welcome, welcome.

932
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,321
You are truly, truly welcome.

933
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,485
Thank you.

934
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:03,280
Have we ever met before?

935
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,040
But actually, I have seen. . .

936
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:11,926
. . .many, many beautiful
photographs of you.

937
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:16,758
Well, I'm honored.
And a congressman.

938
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:21,043
Very successful congressman
you must be.

939
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,805
This is not my boat.

940
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:27,047
It belongs to a very
close friend of mine.

941
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:30,250
Do you like Dino?

942
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:37,687
Dean's great, yeah.
But you know, I've brought my own.

943
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:41,047
Do you care for The Artist
Formerly Known as Prince?

944
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:45,923
I care for you.

945
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,439
So, George, you get to watch
any of the auditions?

946
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,244
Watch, my ass.
I do the hiring.

947
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:56,965
I've seen every girl in Florida.

948
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,169
What are the criteria?
Monster jugs?

949
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,839
Firmness is crucial.

950
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,848
I gotta hold them for a while.
Shake them.

951
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:07,965
You shake their tits?

952
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:12,887
It ain't no picnic, man.
Got tendinitis in my right wrist.

953
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,440
On a rainy day, it's agony.

954
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,489
You audition anybody famous?

955
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,607
You know, before they were famous.

956
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,443
Sure did.

957
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,403
Meryl Streep.

958
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:30,601
Come on!
Meryl Streep stripped?

959
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,647
One of the best.

960
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:36,245
Chesty La France.

961
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,122
That was Meryl.

962
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,041
Chesty La France. I heard of her.

963
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,806
I give you anything you want.

964
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,842
A diamond ring.

965
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,240
A Lexus.

966
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,800
I'll get you a condo on the beach.

967
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,324
just be my girlfriend.

968
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,159
-Can't do that.
-Why not?

969
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,839
I love you.

970
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,042
You don't know what
I've done for you recently.

971
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:26,639
Really? And what was that?

972
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,323
I talked to judge Fingerhut
about your daughter.

973
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,438
You did?

974
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,639
And how did you know about my case?

975
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:37,879
Little birdie told me.

976
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:41,640
It must have been a little old
birdie who knew me very well.

977
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,325
"Who" is not important.

978
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,443
Come on now.

979
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,560
Not just a little hint.

980
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,759
I can't do that.

981
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,647
But I know the new judge.

982
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:01,199
He's a very good friend of mine.
The Honorable jack Goldberg.

983
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,448
He'll be more amenable.

984
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:10,523
Darlin', if you just come
into Davey's life. . .

985
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,846
. . .good things will happen.

986
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,126
You don't know how much
I worship you.

987
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:17,843
How much?

988
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:22,408
I sent my aide, Erb,
over to your laundromat.

989
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:25,886
He brought back some of your lint.

990
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:27,719
My lint?

991
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:29,485
Fresh. . .

992
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,887
. . .hot lint.

993
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:38,760
And what did you do
with that fresh, hot lint?

994
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,286
I'm afraid I made love to it.

995
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:51,240
Close your eyes.
I've got a little surprise for you.

996
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,208
Keep them closed.

997
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,446
No peeking.

998
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:01,649
Don't invade my private life again
or I'll kill you. You understand?

999
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,647
Show's over, big boy.

1000
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:11,445
You'll come back tomorrow?
Same time?

1001
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,969
I don't think so.

1002
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,440
I'll give you $5,000.

1003
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:18,960
Five thousand dollars for no sex?
You love me that much.

1004
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:23,723
Just the touch of your hand
sets my pecker on fire.

1005
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,440
Maybe you should see a doctor.

1006
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:27,765
Same time tomorrow?

1007
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:31,205
If I come, can we talk more
about my case?

1008
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:34,328
We can talk about anything.
As long as you're naked.

1009
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,209
We'll see.

1010
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,443
Good evening.

1011
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,048
You don't know me.
I'm Malcolm Moldovsky.

1012
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:52,882
Dilbeck's right hand.

1013
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,489
You must be a very busy man.

1014
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,838
Touch.

1015
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,687
I wish to give you some advice. . .

1016
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,444
. . .about your adorable
little daughter, Angela.

1017
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:08,325
-What about her?
-Your custody of her is illegal.

1018
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:12,049
That's just temporary
until the appeal gets heard--

1019
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,844
Please, please, Miss Grant.

1020
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:17,245
Really, it's of no concern to us.

1021
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:21,240
As long as you refuse to cooperate
with certain individuals. . .

1022
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:24,641
. . .who seek to harm
and slur Congressman Dilbeck. . .

1023
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:28,249
. . .for their own selfish
political gain.

1024
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,727
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

1025
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,243
Perhaps you don't.

1026
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:44,240
But what a pity if Angela were
to be placed in a state home.

1027
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:45,843
Pretty grim, most of them.

1028
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:49,647
A lot of strange people working there.

1029
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:54,520
I'd recommend that you cooperate
with us for the child's sake.

1030
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:59,044
Which means you talk
to no one about tonight. . .

1031
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,043
. . .or any night.

1032
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:04,800
Understood?

1033
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,206
Of course.

1034
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:10,679
Good.

1035
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:12,648
Now if you'll excuse me. . .

1036
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:15,648
. . .I'd better toss the congressman
into a cold shower.

1037
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,882
By the way, I can see why
he's so taken by your charms.

1038
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:24,839
Good night.

1039
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,688
Watch your step on the gangplank.

1040
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:38,846
She ain't dumb enough.

1041
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:46,119
-Try anything?
-No.

1042
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,448
He ask you back?

1043
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,045
No.

1044
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:54,239
Aren't we Miss Talkative tonight?

1045
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,324
I'm a little tired.

1046
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,644
What's the matter, baby?
Come on.

1047
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,043
Monty.

1048
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:17,966
This reptile's a freaking lemon.

1049
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,683
Who are you?

1050
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,080
Help!

1051
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,288
-So how did it go?
-Fine.

1052
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,443
-No problems?
-No, none.

1053
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:32,686
But no information.

1054
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,799
Zero.

1055
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:39,683
Look, I gotta run, you know.
Angela's wiped.

1056
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:42,000
I'll see you later, okay?

1057
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,689
Come on, come on.

1058
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:55,806
Do something!

1059
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:59,241
I'm doing something.
I'm protecting you.

1060
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,322
-Stand back.
-Oh, my God!

1061
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:05,527
That's not Monty!

1062
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,760
You're fine, hon. You'll be fine.

1063
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:12,842
It doesn't look bad.

1064
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,049
What happened here?

1065
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:19,241
We got a problem with a dead snake.

1066
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:21,243
Gee, that's funny.

1067
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:23,286
So do l.

1068
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:29,049
Here comes that brilliant and charming
attorney of yours, Mr. Mordecai.

1069
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:35,447
Found him 400 yards offshore.
Now show him the rest of his kisser.

1070
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:41,040
Crabs find lawyers
a particular delicacy.

1071
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:42,759
Looks like lasagna.

1072
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:44,720
Cover that shit up.

1073
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:49,039
You wanna tell me why your name
was on his calendar for tomorrow?

1074
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:53,246
I was involved in litigation
with a yogurt company.

1075
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:57,849
>From my limited experience,
this isn't something. . .

1076
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:00,650
. . .a yogurt company
would ordinarily do.

1077
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:03,888
He represented the kid
who got mauled at your club.

1078
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,042
Now that I find fascinating, Shad.

1079
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:09,042
He had a picture.

1080
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:11,927
Man, I'm gonna lose it.

1081
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:14,246
No, no. A picture of what?

1082
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:16,685
A legislator?

1083
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:19,485
Yeah, beating a kid's ass.

1084
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:22,602
-Where's the original?
-I got no idea.

1085
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:26,243
Here, freshen up.

1086
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,038
All right, thanks.

1087
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,923
-Can I interest you in dessert?
-Just the check.

1088
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,040
Good night.

1089
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,889
-Dilbeck didn't invite her back?
-She said no.

1090
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:43,442
That's good. I don't think she should
go there again, even with you.

1091
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:46,480
She seemed all edgy tonight.

1092
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,648
Man, she got her moods.
Could be that time of month.

1093
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:53,445
So you're like the gynecologist-bouncer,
bouncer-gynecologist.

1094
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:57,083
-I just watch out for the girl.
-So do l.

1095
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:00,248
That's a grand total
of two people in Florida.

1096
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:04,284
The higher-ups in my department
aren't pushing this investigation.

1097
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:06,765
-Because of this congressman?
-Bingo.

1098
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:10,042
We got two homicides here,
and nobody gives a shit.

1099
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:12,446
And I'm worried about that girl.

1100
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:15,561
She's out there all by herself.

1101
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,848
Where's the sheriff?

1102
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:05,442
Hello, city desk?

1103
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:19,440
It is an unusual time
for a news conference. . .

1104
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,079
. . .but the congressman feels
it will dramatize his message.

1105
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,649
We'll send a camera crew.

1106
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,523
-Confirm?
-There won't be any need to confirm.

1107
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,482
-Got everything.
-Thank you.

1108
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:31,079
Good morning, pumpkin.
How'd you sleep?

1109
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:32,888
Good. How about you?

1110
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,280
Well, I just--
I slept great, honey.

1111
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,320
Want some cereal?

1112
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:45,448
Not right now.

1113
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,641
-Good morning.
-Hello, CNN?

1114
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,442
-May I help you?
-News desk.

1115
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,049
One second, please.

1116
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:55,479
This is Jennifer. . .

1117
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,483
. . .and I'm calling from
Congressman Dilbeck's office.

1118
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:01,204
Malcolm Moldovsky asked me to call. . .

1119
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,844
. . .about the news conference
at the refinery.

1120
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:15,886
Quit moving!

1121
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,368
Whose Mercedes is that?

1122
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:22,841
-Some orthodontist from Tampa.
-God, what would Mom say?

1123
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,245
She'd say, "Nice fucking car. "

1124
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:27,846
You got a mouth like a sewer!

1125
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,768
I need some morphine.

1126
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,648
I don't got none for humans.

1127
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:33,959
What do you mean?

1128
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,678
All's I got is some
from when Lupa had her cubs.

1129
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:39,125
-Wolf morphine?
-I don't know. I think so.

1130
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:42,322
So give me. I'm dying.
Busted arm, two nights in jail.

1131
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,085
How'd you break it?

1132
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:52,840
Playing polo with Donald Trump, okay?

1133
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,482
It says here you take two
every four hours with a bowl of milk.

1134
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,048
Sounds good to me.

1135
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,047
I said two!

1136
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:05,841
Goddamn it!

1137
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:21,800
Throw down a spade or seven
unless you have an eight.

1138
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:23,443
Then you can change suits.

1139
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:27,838
So that's why
they call it Crazy Eights.

1140
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:29,883
When are you coming back?

1141
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,439
By two. But I hope
you will be asleep.

1142
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:35,324
We'll take care of her.
Don't worry.

1143
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:38,165
You're going out?

1144
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:40,685
I'll be back by two.
I'll dance the late shift.

1145
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,444
-Can you tell me where you--?
-No, I can't.

1146
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,239
-You be good, pumpkin.
-I will.

1147
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,603
She'll be fine.

1148
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:53,768
Don't worry.

1149
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:54,965
See you, baby.

1150
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,048
You're going to the boat?

1151
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,005
Not without me.

1152
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:05,806
I'll be late.

1153
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:07,920
Listen up.

1154
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,439
-You said you weren't going.
-I didn't want anybody to know.

1155
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:11,765
-Like who?
-Garcia.

1156
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,444
Then just say, "Don't tell Garcia. "
What's up?

1157
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:17,562
They'll put Angela in a foster home
if I don't keep my mouth shut.

1158
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,439
-Says who?
-Dilbeck's guy, that creep Moldovsky.

1159
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,848
Promise me you will stay with her
every second. I need to know that.

1160
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:27,848
I can't let you go there alone.

1161
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:31,759
They're gonna pay me $5,000.
I need the money.

1162
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:35,247
I need to get out of here and
live a normal, fully-dressed life. . .

1163
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,799
. . .with shopping lists
and school buses.

1164
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,405
If they wanted to kill me,
they would have.

1165
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,083
Let me get this straight.

1166
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:45,362
So you gonna go there, dance
and come back here.

1167
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:46,840
Correct.

1168
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,125
Something's up.

1169
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:51,366
I've got it under control.

1170
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:54,244
Promise me you'll stay
with Angela every second.

1171
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:59,443
I'll see you later.

1172
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:11,049
Bonsoir.

1173
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:05,206
Sorry.

1174
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:10,043
You speak English?

1175
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:12,843
Sometime.

1176
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:16,483
What do you think
about the people you work for?

1177
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:19,084
They're filth.

1178
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:21,440
Exploiters of the poor.

1179
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:25,848
I think you and I are gonna
get along just fine.

1180
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:32,169
For $5,000, I expect to get laid.
It's only human.

1181
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:33,889
Listen to me.

1182
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:36,644
That beautiful lady
doesn't understand.

1183
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:41,446
She doesn't understand what it's like
to make love to a congressman.

1184
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,242
The ecstasy, the wonderful--

1185
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:46,448
Listen to me, you sick fuck!

1186
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:49,039
She's been meeting with a cop.

1187
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:51,042
Maybe he's from the titty squad.

1188
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,848
He's homicide.

1189
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:55,644
She used to work
at the FBI as a secretary.

1190
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:59,439
This bitch is poison.
She's out to slaughter us.

1191
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:01,841
Make a fool of me.

1192
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,805
Screw yourself bowlegged,
Davey of the Navy.

1193
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:10,444
Then let us handle it.
I'll be on the top deck.

1194
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:19,046
I thought she cared for me.

1195
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:31,766
We're heavy.

1196
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,726
Copy.

1197
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:36,805
No cheating.

1198
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,841
-One, two, three. . . .
-Doesn't look good.

1199
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:42,642
Can't get a break.

1200
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:46,767
Shad's a loser.
Shad's a loser.

1201
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:51,042
All right, Miss Angela.

1202
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,439
Six!

1203
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,641
She always gets six.

1204
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:53,445
Down, Bowser. Be patient.

1205
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:54,884
Don't tease me!

1206
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,687
I'm not teasing.
You just sit back. . .

1207
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,921
. . .relax, have yourself
another drink.

1208
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:04,607
Because tonight is the night.

1209
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:09,163
It sure is.

1210
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:22,726
Who are you?

1211
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:25,125
I want my daughter.

1212
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:29,087
What? Chico!
How'd you get onboard?

1213
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:31,646
My little 'un. I want her.

1214
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:36,558
Your "little 'un,"
whoever she is, is not here.

1215
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:39,566
Chico!

1216
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,963
What's this?

1217
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:47,525
Damn!

1218
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:49,406
Look. . . .

1219
01:31:56,810 --> 01:32:00,120
Well, there's a sight
to raise the dead.

1220
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:03,726
Who's that old freak?

1221
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,321
Hold on a second.

1222
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,408
I know who that is.

1223
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,800
Is that the--?

1224
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:15,603
Is that that guy
from Price ls Right ?

1225
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,647
Oh, damn!

1226
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,762
You got my daughter. . .

1227
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:27,285
. . .and now you try
and kill me with a ax!

1228
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:31,724
I don't have your daughter!
You're confused.

1229
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:35,170
And it's "an" axe.

1230
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,721
I'm stoned. . .

1231
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:40,924
. . .but I ain't confused.

1232
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,720
You stole my little 'un!

1233
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:55,486
Before we make love,
I wish to shave you.

1234
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:57,723
I don't need a shave.

1235
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:03,926
Evening, partygoers.

1236
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,440
Where's Erin?

1237
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:42,049
I don't hear you.

1238
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,247
Bullshit.

1239
01:33:53,810 --> 01:33:55,323
Tiffany!

1240
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:36,685
Is Mommy okay?

1241
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:39,723
She's fine, honey.
We're gonna pick her up now.

1242
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,728
We'll play card games,
have some fun!

1243
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:45,762
She won't like this.
She told me--

1244
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:49,719
I don't care what she told you!
How could you let her go alone?

1245
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:52,564
-I thought you were in jail.
-I made my bail.

1246
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:54,880
-This son of a bitch your--?
-Hang on.

1247
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:58,526
Here's your nickel.
Nice dance.

1248
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:02,120
Would you please
just get out of here?

1249
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:09,241
Are you that guy
from Price ls Right ?

1250
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:13,365
I'm Congressman David Dilbeck.

1251
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:14,565
Congressman?

1252
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,243
-Yeah.
-No shit?

1253
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:17,923
Well, I steal wheelchairs. . .

1254
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:20,320
. . .so we got a lot in common.

1255
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:24,923
I'm getting tired. I think
I just killed a lying weasel.

1256
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,324
You did what?

1257
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:28,959
Beat him with this here club.

1258
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:32,327
Well then, get out!
And leave us alone!

1259
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:34,845
I'm about to mount this here beauty.

1260
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:37,364
Maybe not.

1261
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:40,727
You're talking about my wife.

1262
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:44,920
It's time for us
to take a little drive.

1263
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:47,729
Malcolm.

1264
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:51,123
Malcolm!

1265
01:35:57,010 --> 01:36:00,320
-Move it, move it!
-Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1266
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,122
-Get on--
-Keep quiet!

1267
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:23,488
-Pick a good one. Take it!
-Hurry it up!

1268
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,204
Shit, look at this.

1269
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:27,442
Help me, you assholes.

1270
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:30,523
Help!

1271
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,364
Stop! Stop!

1272
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:40,727
I voted against gun control.
Weapons could end up in the wrong hands.

1273
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,249
Will you please shut up?

1274
01:36:52,810 --> 01:36:53,799
What?

1275
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,929
-It doesn't start.
-Come on, man.

1276
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:01,560
We are in trouble.

1277
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:02,925
Oh, no!

1278
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:15,243
That fracture looks bad.

1279
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:18,642
We ought to drop him off
at the doctor.

1280
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:23,164
-We're not dropping anybody anywhere.
-My sister Rita done up my arm.

1281
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,203
Oh, really?
I'm a great believer in family.

1282
01:37:26,610 --> 01:37:27,929
Do you have a pen and paper?

1283
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:31,250
It didn't feel the way I thought,
killing a man.

1284
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:33,760
-Killing a man?
-It felt terrible.

1285
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:37,606
-I want you to write something.
-What?

1286
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:42,763
I want you to give me
custody of Angela.

1287
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:43,886
No way.

1288
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:46,326
You're going to jail
for what you did. . .

1289
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:50,079
. . .and I will not have that child
placed in a foster home.

1290
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:53,040
So please. A simple note.

1291
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:56,038
"l, Darrell Grant. . . "

1292
01:37:56,290 --> 01:37:58,042
I love that little 'un.

1293
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,043
I know you do.
" . . .give full custody. . . "

1294
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,803
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

1295
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:06,122
Let's do this for her.
Let's not put her at risk anymore.

1296
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:09,640
" . . .to my wife, Erin Grant. "

1297
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,522
Okay.

1298
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:14,439
Good boy.

1299
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:22,924
You know, you write quite poorly.

1300
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:25,726
Are you a high-school graduate?

1301
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:33,886
Shit!

1302
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:40,324
Everybody just stay put, all right?

1303
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:05,526
This girl is nuts.

1304
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:32,768
My prostate doctor said. . .

1305
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:35,922
. . .that I have to urinate
whenever possible.

1306
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:38,798
Then go relieve yourself over there.

1307
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:42,724
Pierre, just stay with him.

1308
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:06,199
Now wake up.
Come on. Here.

1309
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:07,758
You gotta sign this.

1310
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:10,240
Sign your name,
that's all you gotta do. . .

1311
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:11,843
. . .before you get arrested.

1312
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:14,126
Now come on.
Sign your name.

1313
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,406
There you go.

1314
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:24,123
"Darrell Grant. "
Good boy. Good.

1315
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:26,329
That's right.

1316
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,801
I'm back!

1317
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:33,925
No more teasing.

1318
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:36,920
Oh, finally!

1319
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:38,365
What?

1320
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:41,363
Finally you take me like a man.

1321
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,919
Like a congressman.

1322
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:46,047
I knew you cared for me.

1323
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,485
Malcolm didn't know
what he was talking about.

1324
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:51,688
-Now take me.
-Here?

1325
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:54,768
I've got a special spot
picked out for us.

1326
01:40:55,010 --> 01:40:58,320
Get that music box for me,
will you, honey?

1327
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:09,326
-Sorry, boss. It all happened--
-Shut up, you nitwit!

1328
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:13,529
Don't explain. We got a goddamn
stripper about to bring us all down.

1329
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:15,928
How do I look?

1330
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,769
Not bad.

1331
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:22,445
-What happened to him?
-I hit him with a rock.

1332
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:24,169
Who's the man?

1333
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:25,968
You're the man.

1334
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:30,442
You are the man and oh, so strong.

1335
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:34,128
-Well, here we are.
-Here?

1336
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,246
You ever make it
on a pile of sugar before?

1337
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:39,526
No, but I'm willing to try.

1338
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:41,169
Well, you're in for a treat.

1339
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:43,685
You're in for a treat too, darlin' .

1340
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:46,360
Now you just let me
put some music on. . .

1341
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:49,204
. . .while you take off
those pretty little pants.

1342
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:51,566
You'd better put on
some blast goggles.

1343
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:54,324
Because you're in
for an overwhelming sight.

1344
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:55,764
Shit! Radio for help!

1345
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:59,559
What do I tell them?
Congressman Dilbeck abducted a woman.

1346
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,846
They'll shut off their radios
and go help him.

1347
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:04,081
So we're it.
A cop and a bouncer.

1348
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:07,049
Plus two strippers and a kid.
We're in great shape.

1349
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,963
And two.

1350
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:17,565
How come here?
How come not that yacht?

1351
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:20,529
I'm kind of private.
I don't like people watching.

1352
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:23,369
Me neither.
I don't like anything kinky.

1353
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:25,566
I know you don't.
You're a real man.

1354
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:28,927
I knew it when poor Jerry
was killed and Shad's lawyer.

1355
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:33,408
I said, "Davey's the real thing.
An M-A-N man. "

1356
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:35,288
A man blackmails you. . .

1357
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,849
. . .you got to deal with it!

1358
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:38,728
You got to be hard and firm.

1359
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:39,925
And you can dance!

1360
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:41,762
-Marry me.
-What?

1361
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,841
Marry me. Just say it.

1362
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:45,523
-You are married.
-I know.

1363
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:47,925
But I'd leave my wife in a heartbeat.

1364
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:50,730
She wouldn't care.
She doesn't like me anyhow.

1365
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:54,724
Well, this is very sudden,
and I have a lot to think about.

1366
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:57,803
-I'll make you proud of me.
-I know you would.

1367
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,167
It's like when Jerry said,
"l'm gonna shake down Dilbeck. "

1368
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:02,809
And I said, "Are you crazy?

1369
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:06,326
Blackmail a real man like that?"

1370
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:10,199
I said to Malcolm,
"Just do what you have to do. . .

1371
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:13,044
. . .to Jerry, that fat lawyer.
Just do it! "

1372
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:16,168
-Just do it.
-Just do it! And he did.

1373
01:43:16,410 --> 01:43:18,287
-Didn't he?
-He sure did.

1374
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:19,719
You idiot!

1375
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:24,163
-Shit.
-Hi, Malcolm! How you doing?

1376
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:26,765
I'd like to introduce you
to my fiance.

1377
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,289
This is Miss Erin Grant.

1378
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,929
Sorry, Davey.

1379
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:31,483
You both gotta go.

1380
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:33,322
Willie's orders.

1381
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:35,684
You are sick.

1382
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:37,363
Murder-suicide, Miss Grant.

1383
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:38,600
Suicide?

1384
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:42,325
Hell of a story, isn't it?
A congressman and a stripper.

1385
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:46,208
Excuse me.
What did you call me?

1386
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:48,328
A stripper.

1387
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,199
Dancer, asshole.

1388
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,326
George Bush!

1389
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:54,519
That's not George Bush.

1390
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:57,119
That doesn't look anything
like George Bush.

1391
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:02,563
Drop them.
You got till three.

1392
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:03,720
One.

1393
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:06,646
What are you, nuts?

1394
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:09,165
Yeah, psycho.

1395
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:13,323
Delusions of invincibility combined
with a strong homicidal urge.

1396
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,728
I have a kick-your-ass fetish.

1397
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:19,240
Two.

1398
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:29,559
Boss?

1399
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:30,725
Three!

1400
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:34,249
Goddamn it!

1401
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,843
Good evening, everyone.

1402
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:37,682
Postman, postman

1403
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,249
Do your duty

1404
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:42,482
Send this letter
To an American beauty

1405
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:44,721
You're now under arrest.

1406
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:47,125
For a variety of charges.

1407
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:52,169
I need some coffee.

1408
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:54,998
Why don't we start with homicide?

1409
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,563
You're not arresting anyone.

1410
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:05,318
Black.

1411
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:06,765
No sugar.

1412
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:25,405
I said, no sugar.

1413
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:35,608
You know you have
a serious dandruff problem.

1414
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,928
Ladies!

1415
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:41,562
Mama! Mama!

1416
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:45,323
Baby!

1417
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:50,847
-You okay, Mama?
-I'm fine, baby.

1418
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:56,085
See how you could get tendinitis?

1419
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,526
Come on, guys.

1420
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:05,165
Congressman, you called
a news conference?

1421
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:11,241
Holy shit!

1422
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:16,723
Thank you.

1423
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:23,367
There comes a time in
every public figure's career. . .

1424
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,965
. . .when he has to think
about his future.

1427
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:43,759
You idiot!

1428
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,920
Do you have any idea
how nuts this was?

1429
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,928
We're going, baby.

1430
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:54,926
Thank you for all your help.
