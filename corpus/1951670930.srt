1
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,432
<i>The past four years</i>

2
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,974
<i>it's been my honor</i>
<i>to serve as your governor,</i>

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,441
<i>and with your support</i>

4
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,002
<i>I will continue to fight</i>
<i>for each and every one of you.</i>

5
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,545
Aren't you clapping
a little too hard?

6
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,452
I can't help it.
That was fantastic.

7
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,423
His speechwriter
must be brilliant.

8
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,480
Yeah, he's okay.

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,925
If he isn't appreciated here,
he can always go work

10
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,589
for one of the other campaigns
begging for his services.

11
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,961
It's a free country.

12
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,057
<i>...increase Maine's minimum wage</i>

13
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,329
<i>to keep pace with the cost of living.</i>

14
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,634
<i>In the last four years...</i>

15
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,368
Of course, there are perks
to working for the governor.

16
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,172
Yeah, his really hot daughter.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,145
I was thinking of the dental plan,
but she's okay too.

18
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,514
- He's so lucky to have her.
- Oh, he knows that.

19
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,247
That's why he's been waiting
for the perfect time to do this.

20
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,084
<i>I know that we will succeed.</i>

21
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,455
<i>And I want to thank my family</i>

22
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,496
<i>for their love and support--</i>
<i>my beautiful wife Claire...</i>

23
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,925
<i>and my wonderful daughter Maggie.</i>

24
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,586
Ben, you're an excellent
campaign manager,

25
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,558
and I'm sure you're gonna make
an equally fine son-in-law.

26
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,529
Don't worry, Governor. Marriage
and politics aren't that different.

27
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,533
The key to success is
finding the right candidate.

28
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,900
Yes, except marriage
is even better-- no term limits.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,168
Oh, this is so exciting! We can
have the ceremony right out here.

30
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,404
Ben and I were thinking
of something small and intimate.

31
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,571
It'll have to be. You can't fit
more than 400 guests out here.

32
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,116
Okay, when I say "small"...

33
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,616
You know she always gets her way,

34
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,278
so you might as well give in
and save yourself the grief.

35
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,720
- That's true.
- Well, okay, then.

36
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:41,089
An intimate little 400-person
backyard wedding it is.

37
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,629
First Saturday in September's
perfect for a wedding.

38
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,130
The leaves won't have
started to change.

39
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,100
There'll be no showy foliage
competing with the bride.

40
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,034
Yes, I'll be the one in white...

41
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,869
or at least ecru.

42
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,601
Your wedding planner's going
to have something to say about that.

43
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,165
Do you have someone in mind?

44
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,143
I hadn't even thought of that.

45
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,577
Oh, what about Shel?

46
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,308
- Shel?
- Who's Shel?

47
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,873
Ben's brother. Don't you think
he would be perfect?

48
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,409
- Your brother is a wedding planner?
- More of a party planner.

49
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,150
He was telling me he's always
wanted to get into weddings.

50
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,782
Don't you think he'd be great?

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,556
Sure, if you want to have fun,
but this is a wedding.

52
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,089
I mean a formal wedding.

53
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,329
When I think of Shel,
my mind doesn't go to formal.

54
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,996
Mojito time! Who wants?

55
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,300
Over here!

56
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,468
Mustn't go to waste.
There are people sober in China.

57
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,205
Whoa! Kids!

58
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,610
Turn that off, Mark.

59
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,410
I hate being on camera.
Turn that off.

60
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,040
I said cut! Cut it!

61
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,043
Nope, not, no, no...

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,111
I'm cutting you two O-F-F!

63
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,487
Yes, you can have.
Open up.

64
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,685
And... done with you.

65
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,620
Hey, Shel.

66
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,325
Ben! What's wrong?
Mom and Dad okay?

67
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,299
Yeah, they're okay. Why?

68
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,302
Shel! Mayo!

69
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,530
Hold on a second.

70
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,504
Garlic, herb, or spicy aoli?

71
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,099
Garlic!

72
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,644
Incoming!

73
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,078
You know I can't catch.

74
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,383
I know. It's just so much
fun watching you try.

75
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,651
- Ted, Ben's here.
- Ben!

76
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,490
Oh, no! What's wrong?

77
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,020
Can't I visit my brother without
there being something wrong?

78
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,033
Yes, but you never have.

79
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,591
Well, I am now.

80
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,633
Look, if you're too busy,
I'll just...

81
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,866
We'll talk in a second.
Let me flip my burgers.

82
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,432
- Turkey, beef, soy, or veggie?
- Sure.

83
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,512
Move, move.

84
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,189
- What are you doing?
- Get over here.

85
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,591
Hey, there.

86
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,188
Hey.

87
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,098
I live in 203. Dan.

88
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,931
Ben.

89
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,965
So, uh... how do you
know Shel and Ted?

90
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,943
I'm Shel's brother.

91
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,740
Oh. Cool.

92
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,973
I'm engaged...

93
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,808
to a woman.

94
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,647
Needs some more mustard.

95
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,288
Who was that?

96
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,884
I can't believe it!
You and Maggie are getting married!

97
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,759
My God, we love her!
You'll have such beautiful children!

98
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,459
- Congratulations, Ben!
- Thanks, Ted.

99
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,434
So, anyway,

100
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,596
we're thinking
of a September wedding,

101
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,867
and if you're available,
I was hoping that--

102
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,272
I would be your best man?

103
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,174
I would love to!

104
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,213
Actually, I was--
I was gonna ask Wayne.

105
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,270
Oh.

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,112
- I've known him since...
- No, no, no.

107
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,811
I'm sorry. I didn't mean--

108
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,944
No, I shouldn't have assumed.
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,751
So, Ben, what were
you going to ask?

110
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,155
Oh, right.

111
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,217
Uh, listen--
and feel free to say no--

112
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,059
but Maggie thought--
well, we both thought--

113
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,464
that, uh, that you might want
to be our wedding planner.

114
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,566
My first wedding!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

115
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,232
Mine too.

116
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,469
Okay.

117
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,943
<i>I'm glad he was</i>
<i>so excited about it!</i>

118
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,172
Yeah.

119
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,411
Okay, what's wrong?

120
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,917
Nothing.

121
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,452
It's just that, you know,

122
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,011
things are a little awkward
between me and Shel.

123
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,920
Growing up,
we were inseparable.

124
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,482
Little League, fishing,
building forts.

125
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,324
He even followed me all the way
to Maine for college.

126
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,365
All the way to Maine
from New Hampshire--

127
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,263
what is that, like,
a 20-minute trip?

128
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,427
Sorry.

129
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,970
So, what happened?

130
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,165
Nothing happened.
We just, uh...

131
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,038
just sort of drifted apart.

132
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,974
I told him I was gay,
that's what happened.

133
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,945
Of course it wasn't
because he's gay.

134
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,709
I was always fine with that.

135
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,209
He turned white as a sheet
and started mumbling something--

136
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,278
"I've got to get to rugby practice."

137
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,482
It hasn't really been the same since.

138
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,686
That's why I never
came out to my parents.

139
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,526
You know, I figured
if Ben couldn't handle it,

140
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,056
an old-school union guy
like my father would finish his beer,

141
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,468
have a final burp,
and then keel over dead.

142
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,804
Well, on the upside,
this wedding is a great opportunity...

143
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,843
...for you and your brother
to get close again.

144
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,645
I'm thinking of something tasteful
with just a touch of whimsy.

145
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,776
Oh! I adore whimsy!

146
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,753
Yeah, and mostly
we want it to be fun.

147
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,312
Oh, yeah, lots of fun.

148
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,516
You'll get to meet Conrad.

149
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,991
Aren't you meeting with
the Fish and Game Commissioner?

150
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,049
That was cancelled.

151
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,596
The Coast Guard caught some
Norwegians poaching salmon.

152
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,824
Is that illegal now?

153
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,493
Poached salmon makes a terrific entree,
especially with a balsamic reduction.

154
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,594
That sounds good!

155
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,731
Dad, this is Shel, Ben's brother.
He is our wedding planner.

156
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,367
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Yeah, you too.

157
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,536
Thanks for taking on this job.

158
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,514
Seeing as how we're gonna be family,
it'll give us a chance to know you better.

159
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,279
We were just gonna take Shel
for a tour. Want to join us?

160
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,376
Your dad's busy.

161
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,284
Sure, sweetie, it sounds like fun.

162
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,084
- Good.
- Great.

163
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,655
Fun. Fun.

164
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,857
- Please don't say "fabulous."
- Fabulous, simply fabulous.

165
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,766
You see that dock
and the little lighthouse down there?

166
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,669
Conrad had that built for Maggie
on her ninth birthday.

167
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,899
Yes, I did.

168
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,533
Gorgeous. Gorgeous.

169
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,569
I'd say that our best place for
the ceremony is right here on the patio,

170
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,639
with some guests there and there.

171
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,150
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

172
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,651
No.

173
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,086
No? No?

174
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,591
I'd say it'd be best to hold the ceremony
right down here by the water.

175
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,593
We'll build a nice gazebo right there.

176
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,822
The guests could sort of
radiate up the lawn,

177
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,661
improve sightlines, and we
won't have to mike the service.

178
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,930
Shel, maybe the governor
doesn't want anyone radiating.

179
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,166
I'd say he's right.
No, it'll be better his way.

180
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,570
Great! Now for music.

181
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,441
I say we start out with a string quartet--
something simple, elegant.

182
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,502
Eggshell cotton tablecloths

183
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,539
with centerpieces featuring
either pink tea roses or Oriental lilies.

184
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,042
What do you think, honey?

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,315
- It's all good.
- Ben.

186
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,950
This is not you getting together
with your buddies for Super Bowl--

187
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,187
in which case,
I would go with the lilies.

188
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,593
This is your wedding day.
It matters.

189
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,666
Pink tea roses sound nice.

190
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,130
Fine.

191
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,363
Although the lilies
have a stronger scent.

192
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,599
Yes, they do have a lovely fragrance.

193
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,165
Which is helpful
if you're serving fish.

194
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,267
Lilies it is, then.

195
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,141
James!

196
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh, it smells so good in here!

197
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,219
- Hi.
- Hi.

198
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,986
- This is the lovely bride.
- Hello.

199
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,187
- My fiancé.
- Here's the groom, Ben.

200
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,593
Dazzle us.

201
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,427
- ...these two as a centerpiece.
- But these roses are amazing!

202
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,434
She likes the roses.
Let's start with the roses.

203
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,799
- Oh, no.
- Nope.

204
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,269
You missed this...

205
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,796
I love you.

206
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,602
- Ben?
- Yeah?

207
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,667
- What do you think?
- Excellent.

208
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,406
Here. Let's see this.
Here, Ben.

209
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,550
Stop!

210
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,790
Try this.

211
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,226
One, two, three.

212
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,177
Get back on the dance floor!

213
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,786
- Look who's here.
- Hey! Hi!

214
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,954
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.

215
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,362
- Oh, hi!
- Hug, kiss.

216
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,460
I don't know, natural but,
you know, done, but not too done.

217
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,936
More fun. Some movement.

218
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,404
- Done and fun.
- Right.

219
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,304
Fill this out,
pull the bangs over.

220
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,173
- It's puffy, Freddie.
- I mean, not so big.

221
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,439
No Farrah Fawcett.
Give us a little Jaclyn Smith.

222
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,844
Okay, Jaclyn Smith.

223
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,051
- Well?
- Definitely number three.

224
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,216
No.

225
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,656
- No?
- No?

226
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,854
There's coconut in the frosting,
which a lot of people don't like.

227
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,420
The more popular choice will be lemon.

228
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,324
All right.

229
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,398
Lemon it is.

230
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,665
I now pronounce this wedding
good to go.

231
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,502
Just think,

232
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,134
two weeks from today,
we'll be married.

233
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,871
I can't wait.

234
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,750
- Welling! Reelect Welling!
- Reelect Conrad Welling!

235
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,283
No, the governor won't be attending
your anti-immigration rally.

236
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,592
If people from Vermont
want to move to Maine,

237
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,359
putting up a fence won't stop 'em.

238
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,265
Yeah, I know they're annoying,
but we need the syrup.

239
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,927
Ben, you've got to see this.

240
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,531
<i>...declaring any ban on gay</i>
<i>marriage to be unconstitutional.</i>

241
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,701
<i>The decision is already under attack</i>
<i>from Senator Ray Brighton,</i>

242
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,575
<i>Governor Welling's opponent</i>
<i>in the upcoming November election.</i>

243
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,410
<i>And if this decision stands,</i>

244
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,111
<i>gays will be allowed to marry</i>
<i>in Maine beginning next year.</i>

245
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,848
<i>Now, we cannot</i>
<i>allow this to happen.</i>

246
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,685
<i>As your new governor,</i>

247
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,124
<i>my first act will be to seek</i>
<i>a constitutional amendment</i>

248
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,096
<i>restricting marriage</i>
<i>to one man and one woman,</i>

249
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,461
<i>the way God intended it.</i>

250
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,762
So Brighton
is speaking for God now.

251
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,735
That's quite an endorsement.

252
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,862
This is gonna make
gay marriage a major issue.

253
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,066
The press is gonna be
all over you for a response.

254
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,871
I've got a fund-raiser
in Bar Harbor tomorrow.

255
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,412
Let's set up a press conference
while I'm there.

256
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,242
- Will do.
- Is Ben there with you?

257
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,442
I want him to draft my response.

258
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,075
- He's right here.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,643
<i>Ben, I need this speech</i>
<i>first thing in the morning,</i>

260
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,712
<i>so drop everything and get to it.</i>

261
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,779
Okay.

262
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,078
Ready? Easy. Here we go.

263
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,140
- Yep.
- We're good.

264
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,275
- Hello?
- <i>Ben.</i>

265
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,014
Yeah, I just read your pages.

266
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,521
Yes, sir.

267
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,854
They're exactly what
I was looking for. Good job.

268
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,985
- <i>Thank you, sir, thank you.</i>
- Thank you.

269
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,086
- You're welcome.
- <i>Hold down the fort.</i>

270
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,926
- Yes, I will.
- <i>Bravo, Ben.</i>

271
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,659
Thanks. Bye.

272
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,954
It's starting to look beautiful.
You're doing a really great job.

273
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,181
Thanks.

274
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,622
That means a lot to me,
coming from you.

275
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,025
I know Maggie talked you into this,
so I appreciate you saying that.

276
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,757
Where is she? We're supposed
to taste-test champagne.

277
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,824
She's stuck in the office.
She sent me as a replacement.

278
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,564
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

279
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,005
It'll be like when we used to sneak
into Mom and Dad's liquor cabinet.

280
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,441
- Only without puking this time.
- Creme de menthe!

281
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,410
- What were we thinking?
- I don't know.

282
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,913
- Follow me.
- What, you wanna race?

283
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,313
Come on, old man!

284
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,406
Come on!

285
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,646
Stay away
from the schnapps, Shel!

286
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,587
It's a close call,
but I'm leaning toward the Cristal.

287
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,631
No, no. Try a little more
Veuve Clicquot. It grows on you.

288
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,995
There you go.

289
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh. Hey, your song.

290
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,227
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

291
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,499
Come on, come on, come on,
listen, listen.

292
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:54,604
Ben, you're always running
here and there

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,619
You feel you're not
wanted anywhere

294
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,017
Nice vibrato.

295
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:06,421
If you ever look behind

296
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,053
And don't like what you find

297
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,326
Here's something
you should know

298
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,199
You've got a place to go

299
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,395
You've got a place to go

300
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,599
Hey, we should sing that
at the wedding!

301
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,236
Hey, maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we should sober up.

302
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,247
I'm in no hurry, bro.

303
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,680
Me either, bro.

304
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,445
<i>Thanks for that update, Katie.</i>

305
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,749
- <i>Now onto the campaign trail.</i>
- Hey, look.

306
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,187
<i>In a move that will</i>
<i>surely shock campaign pundits,</i>

307
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,157
<i>Governor Welling has weighed in</i>

308
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,423
<i>on the State Supreme Court's</i>
<i>decision legalizing gay marriage.</i>

309
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,590
- Why don't we get some lunch.
- Wait, I want to see this.

310
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,361
<i>Our gay citizens</i>

311
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,165
<i>are entitled to the same</i>
<i>rights and privileges</i>

312
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,797
<i>as everyone else in our great state.</i>

313
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,340
I love this guy.

314
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,775
<i>However, that doesn't mean</i>
<i>we need turn our backs</i>

315
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,040
<i>on thousands of years</i>
<i>of tradition...</i>

316
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,711
<i>which is why I support</i>
<i>a constitutional amendment</i>

317
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,914
<i>to prohibit same-sex marriage.</i>

318
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,351
He's against gay marriage?

319
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,226
More like he's in favor
of traditional marriage.

320
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,992
Let's go get some lunch.

321
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,726
I can't believe it.

322
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,392
He seemed like such a good guy.

323
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,902
He is a good guy.

324
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,336
He's always been
a big supporter of gay rights.

325
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,499
Yeah. Just not this one.

326
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,476
At least not in an election year.

327
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,569
He's an old-fashioned guy,
you know?

328
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,706
And he's not alone.
Over 60% of voters are against it.

329
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,614
Well, that doesn't make it right.

330
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,418
Right?

331
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,387
Oh, no.

332
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,980
You agree with him.

333
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,390
You probably even wrote
his speech.

334
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,793
Oh, my God.

335
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,991
You did.

336
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,064
I can't believe it.
My own brother.

337
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,729
I should've known.

338
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,569
- Come on, Shel.
- I can't believe it.

339
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,701
It's okay for me to plan your wedding,
but not to have my own.

340
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,371
- It's not that simple.
- Seems pretty simple to me.

341
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,711
You think it's fine for me
to be treated differently.

342
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,874
That's not true.

343
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,942
You can still have a wedding.
You just have to marry a woman.

344
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,385
- Funny.
- I'm kidding.

345
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,889
We'll see how funny when
you're planning your own wedding.

346
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,219
You can't walk out.

347
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,386
- We have less than two weeks.
- Good luck. I quit.

348
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,124
You can't quit.
You have our deposit.

349
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,223
Right. Fine, okay.

350
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,995
All right, I'm not quitting.

351
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,300
Thank you.

352
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,465
I'm going on strike.

353
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,831
Strike?

354
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,407
- You can't be serious.
- I'm dead serious.

355
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,951
Dad went on strike
for what he believed in.

356
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,817
Dad struck for higher wages
and better working conditions,

357
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,880
not so he could marry
some guy at the VFW!

358
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,117
You're picketing?

359
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,257
Yep. I'm exercising my right
to free speech,

360
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,326
and my calves, which is perfect,
because today was leg day at the gym.

361
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,869
Shel, I-- I-- I--

362
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,931
This whole "Norma Gay" routine

363
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,942
is not gonna change
the governor's mind.

364
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,205
Well, maybe if I can
change someone's mind.

365
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,737
So this is to rally Maine's
gay soccer mom population?

366
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:22,116
Honk if you support gay marriage!
Honk if you're for gay marriage!

367
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,623
That's the finger of oppression, ma'am!

368
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,386
I can't believe you're doing this to me!

369
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,926
You did this to me first!

370
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:29,983
Yeah?

371
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,087
<i>Hey, Ben, terrific job.</i>

372
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,928
<i>Our position on gay marriage</i>
<i>is getting a great reaction.</i>

373
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,989
Mostly.

374
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,865
I even got a response
from the White House.

375
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,767
<i>The President</i>
<i>and First Lady are coming</i>

376
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,330
<i>to help me with the campaign,</i>
<i>and then they're gonna</i>

377
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,568
stay for the wedding.

378
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,871
My God, that's amazing!

379
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,504
What's amazing? Is that the Governor?
Let me talk to him.

380
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,845
Is that Shel? Put him on.
I want to give him the good news.

381
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,646
He's got his hands full right now.

382
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,516
He's really busy.
Sorry, Governor.

383
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,282
I'll be sure to tell him.
Sorry. Bye.

384
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,880
Hello? Ben?

385
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,721
You can hang up on me,
but I will not be silenced.

386
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,454
- Support gay marriage!
- Shel? Shel?

387
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:07,624
The President of the United States
is coming to this wedding.

388
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,598
The President?

389
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,105
This is gonna be the most
important night of your career,

390
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,606
so put down the picket sign.

391
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,768
Well, this changes everything.

392
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,176
I'm gonna have
to rethink this whole thing.

393
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,406
The seating chart.

394
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,472
The menu, of course.
I mean, the menu...

395
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,452
Wait a minute.
I see what you're doing.

396
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:34,049
If I quit, the bad guys--
meaning you-- win. Good.

397
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,650
Very clever. Good try.

398
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,592
- Support gay marriage!
- You've been drinking.

399
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,392
You've been drinking too!

400
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,594
Who do you trust that's sober?
What about your... your...

401
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,829
Ted?

402
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,630
The prosecution has no objection

403
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,503
to the defense's request
for a continuance, Your Honor.

404
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,941
Very well. Trial will resume
on Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

405
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,078
Hey! I was just gonna call you.
Want to grab some dinner?

406
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,644
Why not?

407
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,487
What?

408
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,629
Shel, have you lost your mind?

409
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,065
Honk if you support
gay marriage!

410
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,940
I'm glad you showed up.
He won't listen to reason.

411
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,001
He'll listen to reason. I think
he just doesn't want to listen to you.

412
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,047
You go. Take off.
Everything will be fine.

413
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,376
Thanks.

414
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,940
So now you're in league
with Darth Brother?

415
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,179
Only partly.

416
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,778
I understand how you're feeling,
but what are you doing?

417
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,324
You're not political.
You don't even watch the news.

418
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,552
Anderson Cooper doesn't count.

419
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,390
You don't have to watch the news
to know the governor is wrong.

420
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,524
So join one of the gay political groups
that I'm sure will be protesting.

421
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,898
You're just gonna look foolish
out here by yourself.

422
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,631
Why don't you join me?
Then I'll only look half-foolish.

423
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,074
Because I happen to be
a state prosecutor who likes his job.

424
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,113
They frown on us
heckling the governor.

425
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,638
Shel, I love you,
but I can't do this.

426
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,911
All right.

427
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,579
Well, I guess we both have to do
what we think is right.

428
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,416
It's gonna be getting dark.

429
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,291
Why don't we talk about this
more at home?

430
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,721
I think I'm gonna stay here tonight.

431
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,788
All night?

432
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,425
But you hate camping!

433
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,232
It'll be cold, and there'll be bugs,

434
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,738
and Heath Ledger won't be
coming by to cuddle with you.

435
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,741
I'll be fine.

436
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,835
All right. You know, Shel,
I wasn't gonna say this before,

437
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,903
but this is really tacky.

438
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,818
I think you'd better go now.

439
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,415
Support my constitutional right
to get married!

440
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,924
Support my right to get married.

441
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,324
Support my constitutional right
to get married!

442
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,325
Support my right to gay marriage!

443
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,763
Gay marriage, anyone?

444
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,240
At least Rosa Parks
got to sit down.

445
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,338
Hey.

446
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,448
- You here to support gay marriage?
- Hell, no.

447
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,582
I'm here 'cause some guy named Ted
ordered you a pizza and a six-pack.

448
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,421
Oh, thank you.
I got it. Thanks.

449
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,572
I love that you keep yourself
in shape for me,

450
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,109
but don't you think
you're overdoing it a little bit?

451
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,269
It's not for you.

452
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,835
It's for the President.

453
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,108
If I can't be the most important man
at my wedding,

454
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,013
I can at least
have the best pecs.

455
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,813
<i>...or use other means</i>
<i>of transportation.</i>

456
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,820
<i>Governor Welling announced</i>
<i>at a press conference today</i>

457
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,857
<i>that he is in favor of</i>
<i>an amendment to ban gay marriage.</i>

458
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,050
What?

459
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,616
<i>This puts both he and his opponent,</i>
<i>Senator Brighton,</i>

460
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,889
<i>on the same side of the issue,</i>
<i>effectively making it</i>

461
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,430
<i>a dead issue in the campaign.</i>

462
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,966
Okay, let me say one thing
before you get mad.

463
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,525
Too late. How could my father
do something like this?

464
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,935
Because even though
he supports gay rights,

465
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,634
he believes marriage should be
between a man and a woman.

466
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,506
What did he say when
you tried to talk him out of it?

467
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,978
"Thanks, Ben, I'm glad we agree"?

468
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,481
You agree?
How could you possibly agree?

469
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,575
- Your own brother is gay!
- Don't remind me.

470
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,051
What is that supposed to mean?

471
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,520
Ben, are you embarrassed
that Shel is gay?

472
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,489
No.

473
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,219
Okay, maybe a little.

474
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,561
Hey, but on some level,
Shel is too.

475
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,223
That's insane. He is totally out.

476
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,062
He wears a Prada shoulder bag!

477
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,897
Not in front of our parents,
he doesn't.

478
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,769
That is not a cat he wants
out of the bag, Prada or not.

479
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,670
What did he say
when he heard about this?

480
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,606
Okay, I'm not gonna lie to you.

481
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,669
He was a little miffed.

482
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,906
- I'm calling him!
- No, please don't do that.

483
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,916
Look, he's probably
forgotten all about it by now.

484
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,475
Besides, he and Ted
are already in bed.

485
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,990
If you call, you might
interrupt... things.

486
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,526
Things? It's called sex, Ben.

487
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,152
You can't even say it. Sex.

488
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,593
I can say it, okay?

489
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,791
I'm just more comfortable
when it involves a man and a woman.

490
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:47,265
Especially when that woman is looking
very sexy in her pink nightgown.

491
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,871
You and your brother have a lot more
in common than you think.

492
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,139
Oh, yeah? What's that?

493
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,444
Neither one of you is gonna be
having sex with a woman tonight.

494
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,954
Crazy man.

495
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,429
Support gay marriage.

496
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,769
Morning, Ben.

497
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:31,241
Question: why is your brother
picketing outside my house?

498
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,142
One, two, three, four.
Don't you close that closet door!

499
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,741
Five, six, seven, eight.
Open up the marriage gate.

500
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,343
- Shel?
- Yes.

501
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,887
Ben told me you were upset,

502
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,219
but this isn't the way
to change my mind.

503
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,986
What is the way
to change your mind?

504
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,890
Well, to be honest,
there is none.

505
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,397
One, two, three, four.
I don't work here anymore!

506
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,659
Five, six, seven, eight...

507
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,825
- Shel?
- Yes, Claire?

508
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,232
Don't you think
that you could protest Conrad

509
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,271
but at the same time
help Maggie and Ben?

510
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:04,968
It's just a picket sign.
It's not as if he's hanging you in effigy.

511
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,807
That's a good idea.
Can I borrow his red and blue sweater?

512
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,347
Oh, you don't want to use that.
It's hideous.

513
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,007
It's so red-state, blue-state.

514
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,051
Madeleine Albright
gave me that sweater.

515
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,052
Governor, I'm really sorry about this.

516
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,392
Well, it's really not your fault, Ben...

517
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,328
but what do you plan to do about it?

518
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,299
I got it covered. After you called me,
I came up with a plan.

519
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,996
- I'll do anything short of a Taser.
- Oh, don't worry.

520
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,972
My plan is equally effective,
and twice as deadly.

521
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,500
Support my right
for gay marriage!

522
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,068
Support my right...

523
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,846
Hi! Hi!

524
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,560
Shel, look who came out early.
Mom and Dad.

525
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,764
- Oh, look at you.
- Hi, Mom.

526
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,925
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

527
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,196
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Shel, how are you?

528
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,239
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, give me a hug.

529
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,666
Whoa.

530
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,842
Oh, Vern, have you ever seen
such a beautiful house?

531
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,320
Doesn't have wheels.

532
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,722
Ben says you've been doing
a knockout job on this wedding.

533
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,454
That's why I thought it'd be fun
to have you come out early,

534
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,189
so you could see Shel hard at work.

535
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,190
Yeah. All right, well,
why don't I show you around?

536
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,463
- Follow me.
- Say, Shel?

537
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,835
What were you doing out here,
anyway?

538
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,466
- Taking a walk.
- In front of the governor's house?

539
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,273
- Back and forth, back and forth?
- Yes, it helps me relax.

540
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,746
What do you guys want
to see Shel work on first?

541
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,283
How about the seating chart?
That's not done, is it?

542
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,479
You know what? I will not be
blackmailed any further.

543
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,613
Honey, you can say
anything you want.

544
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,954
We don't care about
the seating chart.

545
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,188
No, this is something
I should've done a long time ago.

546
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,457
- Mom, Dad...
- Oh, no.

547
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,793
I'm gay.

548
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,324
Ben and Maggie have been
living in sin for over a year.

549
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,567
Is it because I made you
watch ice skating with me?

550
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,303
No, Mother.

551
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,844
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

552
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,402
I'm just gay,

553
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,143
same way some people
are just smart or just tall or...

554
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,651
- Or just Lutheran?
- Yes, exactly.

555
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,587
Actually, I was born gay,
where people choose to be Lutheran.

556
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,714
You were born Lutheran, Shel.

557
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,850
It says so right on
your birth certificate.

558
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,360
No, Dad, that's because...

559
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,090
And it doesn't say "gay,"
I can promise you that.

560
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,622
Okay, the point is,
this is who I am,

561
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,295
and I just hope you both
can accept it.

562
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,334
He really did it.

563
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,703
I'm afraid he's not
giving up anytime soon.

564
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,144
So now what?

565
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,409
First thing is to
keep it out of the press.

566
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,509
He's one guy with a picket sign.
Since when is that news?

567
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,147
Since the guy is the brother of the man
marrying the governor's daughter,

568
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,090
whose wedding the President
and First Lady will be attending.

569
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,094
Okay. I'll switch all press away from...

570
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,130
- Tisdale.
- Tisdale?

571
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:17,099
Channel 9 News. I sent him to do a piece
on the wedding with Maggie today.

572
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,362
Oh, God. Maggie.

573
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,963
Well, call him. Call her.
Call it off!

574
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,235
It's too late.
They're on their way here now.

575
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,140
Damn, we got to get rid
of my brother.

576
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,874
How?

577
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,312
The governor wants to meet?

578
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,817
I can't promise he'll change his mind.
You've got one chance to wow him.

579
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,819
It doesn't mean
I'm calling off the strike.

580
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,115
We wouldn't expect that.

581
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,951
We've got to hurry.
He's waiting for you.

582
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,354
Not that way.

583
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,126
We're meeting on a boat?

584
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,721
Not so much a boat
as it is a nautical conference room.

585
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,495
This is Ed Myerson,
the governor's press secretary.

586
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,126
The governor was called away.

587
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,068
He asked me to
write down your thoughts

588
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,072
in anticipation of a later meeting.

589
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,008
Ed will take down everything,
so cover all your points in detail.

590
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,136
Ready when you are.

591
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:05,740
Uh... okay, uh... well, I guess, um,
basically the question is,

592
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,285
Why can my brother get married
and I can't?

593
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,752
- Of course.
- Right?

594
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,052
I mean, that's how this whole thing
kind of started, you know.

595
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,854
That was the initial conception...

596
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,661
What are you doing here?

597
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,165
Master's in journalism
from Northwestern.

598
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,498
They send me out to cover
this cotton candy crap.

599
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,538
I thought it would be fun
if we did the interview together.

600
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,305
Well, hello!
There's the happy couple.

601
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,641
Casper, this is Maggie,
my beautiful bride-to-be.

602
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,373
Maggie, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

603
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,642
You too. Where's Ed?

604
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,210
See, if you don't treat people equally,

605
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:46,347
this essentially stops
becoming America, right?

606
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,016
- Right?
- Right.

607
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,957
I'm here at Governor Welling's estate,

608
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,987
where this Saturday a very
special wedding will take place.

609
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,693
Even the bridal bouquet
will be red, white, and blue.

610
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,861
I mean, sure, anyone can
live together, but...

611
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,166
...saying "I do" in front
of my family and friends

612
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,230
is gonna be
the happiest day of my life.

613
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,400
So, are you brave enough to tell us

614
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,410
what a wedding
whose guest list includes

615
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,379
the President
of the United States costs?

616
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,474
Well, we could, but money's
not important. What matters is...

617
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,985
...having your relationship
accepted by society.

618
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,248
That's true.

619
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,913
I just want
what everyone else has.

620
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,287
Yeah.

621
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,689
Everybody-- No!

622
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,422
What's going on here?
You're doodling?

623
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,760
- What is this? What are you doing?
- It's an octopus.

624
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,928
There's no doubt
in this reporter's mind

625
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,769
that the state of this union
will be happily ever after.

626
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,172
This is Caspar Tisdale
for Channel 9.

627
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,945
I think that went well, don't you?

628
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,106
You jerk! You liar!

629
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,979
Shel, oh, my God, you're soaked.

630
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,314
- Who's that?
- Don't worry about him.

631
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,514
Stop! Don't put that camera away.
They're trying to silence me.

632
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,079
Support gay marriage!

633
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,024
How fast can we set up again?

634
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,062
<i>It's the Channel 9 News with anchors</i>
<i>Matt Wildman and Katie Gonzales,</i>

635
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,568
<i>Arlo Donovan with the weather,</i>
<i>and Brook Palmer on sports.</i>

636
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,565
- I'm toast.
- I'm not speaking to you.

637
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,837
Thank you for doing this. You're really
gonna help me get my message out.

638
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,879
Hey, call me Caspar.
Sounds better on the air.

639
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,505
<i>Welcome to Channel 9 News.</i>

640
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,879
Poor Shel.

641
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,111
I didn't lie to you.
I told you he was miffed.

642
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,413
Miffed?

643
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,819
"Miffed" and "on strike"
are not the same thing.

644
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,858
When factory workers get screwed,
the union does not go out on "miff."

645
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,792
Ben, don't you think your parents
would like to come inside?

646
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,194
Oh, I think they'd rather
be alone in the RV for a while.

647
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,561
It's been a pretty rough day.

648
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,033
Okay, this says it has something
to do with Shel's genes.

649
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,263
Not his blue jeans,

650
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,966
which I always thought
he wore too tight anyway, but...

651
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,400
Oh, dear.

652
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:51,112
FYI: poor Shel told them
we've been living together.

653
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,615
Now they think you're a slut.

654
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,241
<i>...more liberal constituents.</i>

655
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,446
<i>Both Governor Welling and his</i>
<i>opponent, Senator Ray Brighton,</i>

656
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,787
<i>have announced their support</i>
<i>of a constitutional amendment</i>

657
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,292
<i>defining marriage as between</i>
<i>a man and a woman.</i>

658
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,659
<i>But for at least one member</i>
<i>of the governor's circle,</i>

659
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,925
<i>this announcement</i>
<i>was a call to action.</i>

660

<i>Caspar Tisdale joins us now</i>
<i>with more on the story.</i>

661

<i>This is Caspar Tisdale reporting live</i>
<i>from Governor Welling's estate,</i>

663
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,238
where an unusual protest
is underway.

664
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,334
Shel Grandy was handling
the arrangements

665
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,902
for his brother's wedding
to the governor's daughter--

666
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,279
<i>that is, until the governor</i>
<i>came out against gay marriage,</i>

667
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,750
<i>and that's when Mr. Grandy,</i>
<i>who happens to be gay,</i>

668
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,946
<i>decided to go on strike.</i>

669
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,856
<i>Do I talk now?</i>

670
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:38,259
<i>Well, you wouldn't be</i>
<i>a very good spokesman if you didn't.</i>

671
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,765
<i>Well, I'm here to say that</i>
<i>the governor is being unfair.</i>

672
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,962
<i>Your protest doesn't seem</i>
<i>to have picked up much steam.</i>

673
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,902
<i>Has anyone joined you</i>
<i>out here on the line?</i>

674
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,100
<i>No, I'm pretty much...</i>
<i>I'm just doing this on my own.</i>

675
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,609
<i>Do you think that</i>
<i>will change the governor's mind?</i>

676
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,703
<i>No, no, I don't think</i>
<i>that's gonna happen.</i>

677
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,214
<i>He already told me that</i>
<i>he's not gonna change his mind.</i>

678
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,183
So at this point, you're really
just striking out of spite.

679
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,344
No, I'm--

680
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,853
<i>I'm striking--</i>

681
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,721
<i>I'm striking for my--</i>
<i>my beliefs.</i>

682
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,818
<i>I believe wholeheartedly</i>
<i>in my beliefs.</i>

683
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,557
I guess you got all the political savvy
in your family, huh?

684
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,326
He's never done this before.

685
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,264
<i>What would you say</i>
<i>to all the people</i>

686
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,896
<i>who are thinking you're just</i>
<i>another crackpot with an axe to grind?</i>

687
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,805
Shut up!
No one's thinking that.

688
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,398
<i>We're not just a fringe group.</i>

689
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,001
<i>There are a lot of us out here,</i>
<i>Mr. Tisdale.</i>

690
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,376
<i>Interesting thought.</i>

691
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,712
<i>If all the world's florists,</i>
<i>hairstylists, and choreographers</i>

692
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:36,048
<i>were to go on strike,</i>
<i>could we survive?</i>

693
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,645
<i>For Channel 9 Action News,</i>
<i>this is Caspar Tisdale</i>

694
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,385
<i>reporting live from</i>
<i>Governor Welling's estate.</i>

695
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,086
Great TV, kid.

696
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,221
You bitch.

697
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,893
He made Shel look like
a complete fool.

698
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,129
- He did, didn't he?
- Yep.

699
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,535
<i>Well, I'd sure hate to lose</i>
<i>my hairstylist.</i>

700
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,045
<i>Let's hope he doesn't strike</i>
<i>while the curling iron is hot.</i>

701
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,207
<i>And on that note, let's go</i>
<i>"straight" to the weather</i>

702
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,614
<i>with Arlo Donovan.</i>

703
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,685
Where's Arlo?

704
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,221
He just left.

705
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,417
It appears Arlo has
stepped away from the map.

706
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,053
<i>Turning now to our next story...</i>

707
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,927
<i>"I'm on strike too, ass wipes."</i>

708
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,032
<i>Katie?</i>

709
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,468
<i>Back to you, Matt.</i>

710
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,006
Honey!
Were you watching upstairs?

711
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,708
That fruit loop I delivered
pizza to was on the news.

712
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,678
Jerome, we need to talk.

713
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:22,555
You're being too hard on yourself.
He didn't even give you a chance to talk.

714
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,321
Mom says don't feel too bad.

715
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,660
She'd come out and tell you herself,
but she's too busy telling Dad.

716
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,157
Why did they decide
to come out so early?

717
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,798
Oh, my God. You're kidding.
You called them?

718
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,806
Are you okay?

719
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,901
Yeah.

720
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,573
I thought if I'd go on TV,
I'd get some people on my side,

721
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,482
but I just ended up looking like
a jackass, just like you predicted.

722
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,213
It wasn't that bad.

723
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,686
It'd be easier to believe

724
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,316
if you hadn't felt the need
to race over here and tell me.

725
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,986
Well, the important thing is
it's all behind us now.

726
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,154
Come on.
Let's go home.

727
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,193
What are all these cars doing here?

728
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,304
Oh, no.

729
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,239
- What kind of strike is this?
- Well, I don't know.

730
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,775
Is anything even open?

731
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,834
- What's going on?
- We're on strike. Goodbye.

732
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,207
I can't believe it!
What is going on?

733
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,505
This strike is something else!

734
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,619
Support Shel!

735
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,211
Support gay marriage!

736
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,382
Send a message
to our governor.

737
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,485
Support Shel!
Here, take a flyer.

738
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,961
Support Shel!

739
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,222
Reelect Welling. Please hold.

740
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,291
Ben, thank God you're here.

741
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,166
The advance team
from the White House is at the airport

742
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,138
and no one was there to pick them up.

743
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,833
But Angela arranged for a limo.

744
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,205
The limo service is on strike.

745
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,210
Well, why didn't she call
somebody else?

746
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,540
Angela's on strike too.

747
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,549
Hello? Reelect Welling.
Please hold.

748
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,552
Hello? Mom? Not now.

749
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,181
Five, six, seven, eight,
open up the marriage gate!

750
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,818
One, two, three, four,
don't you close that closet door!

751
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,557
Five, six, seven, eight,
open up the marriage gate!

752
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,759
One, two, three, four,
don't you close that closet door!

753
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,531
Five, six, seven, eight,
open up the marriage gate!

754
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,334
One, two, three, four,
don't you close that...

755
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,501
Well, naturally,
world affairs come first.

756
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,245
Well, you give
the First Lady my best.

757
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,244
An emergency summit
on the Middle East has come up.

758
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,650
The President won't be
attending the wedding.

759
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,654
Well, if it's an emergency summit--

760
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,681
Please. An emergency summit
is the presidential equivalent

761
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,627
of "I'd love to come,
but I have to wash my hair."

762
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,571
Whoa! What do you
think you're doing?

763
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,817
Honoring the strike.

764
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,322
Hi, is this World of Weddings?

765
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,621
Yes, I'm calling about
a wedding coordinator.

766
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:21,162
This Saturday
at the Governor's estate. Hello?

767
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,132
No, the wedding
is actually this Saturday.

768
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,135
At the, uh, Governor's estate.

769
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,297
Hello?

770
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:31,170
Hi. I'm looking
for a wedding coordinator.

771
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,007
Hello, Till Death Do Us Part?

772
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,410
Yeah, this Saturday
at the Governor's estate.

773
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,514
This Saturday
at the Governor's estate.

774
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,920
Hi, I was wondering
if you could help me out.

775
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,118
I need a wedding coordinator.

776
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:52,287
Oh, you have...
many wedding coordinators.

777
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,489
That's fantastic.

778
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,534
Thank you for coming
on such short notice, Mrs...

779
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,127
Fairfield, darling, Fairfield.

780
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,934
And you're in very good hands.

781
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:06,636
I'm known as
"The Wedding Planner to the Stars."

782
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,200
In Maine?

783
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,873
Remember Tony Orlando and Dawn?
I did one of the Dawns' weddings.

784
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,041
Oh, she was--

785
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,018
Okay, what the hell is going on
at the gate? I can't hear myself think!

786
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,884
Oh, that's, uh--
that's-- that's nothing.

787
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,890
Actually, it's our
former wedding planner

788
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,119
making a very valid stand
for gay rights.

789
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:27,726
Well, my second
husband Macey was a gay.

790
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,698
Yeah. Gay as the day is long.

791
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,235
He ran off
with the pool boy, Javier.

792
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,033
He's a very handsome man, Javier.

793
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:39,007
Always wore a white thong.

794
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,943
Didn't speak a word of English.
Didn't have to.

795
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,748
Azaleas!

796
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:47,909
Excuse me?

797
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:52,979
Nothing says "we'll be
together forever" like azaleas!

798
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:57,152
You know, actually,
we like everything Shel picked out.

799
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,685
- We just need you to coordinate.
- Gold lamé as far as the eye can see!

800
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,723
Giant topiary cupids,
dancing waterfall...!

801
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,202
...three, four, don't you close
that closet door.

802
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,796
Five, six, seven, eight,
open up the...

803
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,807
Let her through.
Let her through.

804
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,171
Shel, I don't want to do
this wedding without you.

805
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,682
I want to postpone,
but they're trying to guilt me into it.

806
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,185
My father says it's gonna
hurt his campaign.

807
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,720
That's okay, Maggie.
I understand.

808
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,450
- I love you.
- I love you too.

809
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,959
You're gonna miss
a great wedding, Shel.

810
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,797
Mrs. Fairfield
has lots of good ideas--

811
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,963
ice sculptures, a champagne
fountain, cherub caterers.

812
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,563
Cherub caterers?

813
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,473
Yep. She's promised us
lots of pizzazz.

814
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,945
Pizzazz.

815
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,107
The only thing worse than
pizzazz is razzle-dazzle.

816
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,785
- Wayne?
- Dude!

817
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,858
Oh! That's how you
greet your best man!

818
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,895
I thought you were staying
at the Verdi Hotel.

819
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,907
So did I, but they
screwed up my reservation.

820
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,637
Something about the gay dudes
going on strike.

821
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,272
So it looks like I'm gonna be
crashing here with you...

822
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,340
and Magpie.

823
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,655
<i>What started out as a simple,</i>
<i>one-man protest</i>

824
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,424
<i>has ended up affecting every state...</i>

825
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,227
<i>From Augusta, Maine,</i>
<i>to San Diego, California,</i>

826
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,564
<i>no American city</i>
<i>is immune to the strike.</i>

827
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,094
<i>In a wave of support that</i>
<i>caught most Americans by surprise,</i>

828
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:52,700
<i>Shel Grandy's strike for the right</i>
<i>to marry has swept the nation...</i>

829
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:56,007
<i>The gay strike is one week old,</i>
<i>and there seems to be no end in sight.</i>

830
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,231
<i>You? I'm totally surprised.</i>

831
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,929
<i>The way that it's sweeping the nation</i>
<i>demonstrates the level of discontent.</i>

832
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,028
<i>It's sort of like the gay equivalent to</i>

833
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,699
<i>"I'm mad as hell,</i>
<i>and I'm not gonna take it anymore."</i>

834
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,799
<i>Excellent analogy.</i>

835
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,901
<i>Thanks. Sort of</i>
<i>getting the hang of this.</i>

836
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,640
<i>So, you're out there</i>
<i>striking for gay marriage.</i>

837
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,046
<i>We know you've gotten</i>
<i>thousands of proposals.</i>

838
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,051
<i>Does anybody "strike" your fancy?</i>

839
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,054
<i>I'm not gonna deny there are</i>
<i>a lot of great guys out there,</i>

840
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,249
<i>but no one compares</i>
<i>to my boyfriend Ted.</i>

841
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,587

844
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,656
<i>Thank you.</i>

845
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,697
Can I have one of those?

846
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,607
Thanks.

847
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,782
- <i>What do we want?</i>
- <i>Marriage equality!</i>

848
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,950
- <i>When do we want it?</i>
- <i>Now!</i>

849
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,524

<i>In yet another assault on one</i>

853
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,208
<i>gays want to get married.</i>

854
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,515
<i>What next? Polygamy?</i>

855
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:21,489
<i>Incest?</i>
<i>A man marrying his dog?</i>

856
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,987
Don't even think about it.

857
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,100
<i>The Dow-Jones is already</i>
<i>looking good in heavy trading.</i>

858
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,868

Hey, Ted.
Congratulations.

867
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:14,510

You guys, it's Ted!

871
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,996
All right, Ted!

872
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,663
Congratulations!

873
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:21,340
Throwing a strike is no different
than throwing a good party.

874
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,606
The key is make sure
everyone feels welcome

875
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,910
and keep them circulating.
That's about it.

876
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:30,380
Uh-oh. Excuse me
one second, please.

877
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,855
Hi. I know what you're gonna say,
and I'm really sorry.

878
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,290
Can we please talk
about this in private?

879
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,485
Sure.

880
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:43,188
Oh! Hello! I'm Wanda.
I'm Shel's mom.

881
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,600
I recognize you from the newspaper.
You're Shel's special friend.

882
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,662
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, you!

883
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:05,110
It's not funny. Are you sure
these are the ones Shel ordered?

884
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,156
Well, they're the ones they sent.

885
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,715
Mind you, they were
giggling when they delivered.

886
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,727
I'm sorry!

887
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,820
Never mind.

888
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:18,834
Look, darling, there is still time
to get you in a nice top hat and tails.

889
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,430
Maybe you should wear
your blue Armani.

890
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:28,240
Dude, these tuxes you ordered
are awesome!

891
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,883
Oh, God.

892
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,246
Oh, God.

893
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,352
I like it.

894
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,958
- Sorry about that.
- No need to apologize.

895
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,624
I was happy to be
grilled by your mom

896
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,998
about an impending wedding
I know nothing about!

897
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,127
She seemed to like you.

898
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,803
I never said anything
about us getting married.

899
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,844
I mentioned your name
once in an interview. That's it.

900
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:02,936
- That's it?
- Yeah.

901
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,878
The bailiff wants
to throw me a shower!

902
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,643
It'll blow over.
You know the press.

903
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:10,083
Tomorrow Britney will drop
another baby, and it'll be old news.

904
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,620
I'd better be.

905
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,722
And so what if people think
we do want to get married?

906
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,487
Is that a bad thing?

907
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,659
We just moved in together
six months ago.

908
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,930
Eight months ago. And we've been
together two and a half years.

909
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,404
- That's longer than Ben and Maggie.
- We're not like them.

910
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,737
What are you saying to me?

911
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,710
Are you saying you wouldn't want
to marry me even if you could?

912
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,009
- I don't-- I don't know.
- You don't know?

913
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,846
I don't know.

914
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:44,283
I've never spent one instant of my life
thinking about getting married.

915
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,221
One of the benefits of being gay
was that I always thought

916
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,623
I wouldn't have to spend one instant
thinking about getting married,

917
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,059
until now, thanks to you.

918
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,961
Who wants to marry you anyway?
Not me. I'm not asking.

919
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:56,955
Well, fine.

920
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,057
Fine.

921
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,207
Bridesmaids swing to the left.

922
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,577
The cherub flower girl
takes her position.

923
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,876
Everyone settles.

924
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,644
There's a hush, and I sing...

925
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,983
<i>Sometimes when we touch...</i>

926
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,988
<i>Governor brings Maggie...</i>

927
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,422
<i>The honesty's too much...</i>

928
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,481
<i>Maggie, greet Ben.</i>

929
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,758
<i>And I have to close my eyes</i>
<i>and hide</i>

930
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,264
<i>Maggie, turn away.</i>

931
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,300
<i>Ben, swing her around gently</i>
<i>toward you.</i>

932
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,201
<i>I want to hold you till I die</i>

933
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,296
<i>He takes her left hand.</i>

934
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,432
<i>Till we both break down and cry</i>

935
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,100
<i>She takes his hand.</i>

936
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,440
<i>I want to hold you...</i>
<i>Squeeze it!</i>

937
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,810
<i>Till the fear in me</i>

938
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,781
<i>Maggie's line--</i>
<i>"Ben, I'm scared."</i>

939
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,478
<i>Ben--</i>
<i>"I know. I'm here."</i>

940
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:54,184
<i>Subsides</i>

941
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,456
I also do a terrific "Mack the Knife,"

942
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:01,691
but I'd like to save that for when
you're ready to cut the cake, okay?

943
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:02,959
Well?

944
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,160
Really good.

945
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,600
Yeah.

946
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,797
But you're going to be so busy.

947
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,433
Maybe we should just
go with a deejay.

948
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,534
What are you talking about?

949
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,172
Nothing is as good
as live musicians.

950
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,842
- Is he alive?
- Ben!

951
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,316
We're gonna think about it,

952
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:26,287
'cause we need to go get ready
for the rehearsal dinner, so...

953
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,917
Oh, really?
Where you having it?

954
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,127
Sorry, Governor,
we ran out of Guinness,

955
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,630
and our delivery guy is out on...

956
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:37,423
Well, you know.

957
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,795
Yeah, we know.

958
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,633
- Fish and chips and burgers coming up.
- I'm really sorry about this.

959
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,904
I had a reservation at Finique,
but they got the dates mixed up.

960
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,536
That's a shame.
I really love French food.

961
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,877
What's odd is that none of the other
places you called could fit us in either.

962
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,543
I'll bet that's because of Shel.

963
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:58,178
Turns out your son's very popular.

964
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,247
Well, at least one of them is.

965
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:04,350
Well, Shel always did have
loads of friends.

966
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:08,488
Who wouldn't be proud to count Shel
amongst their friends and their family?

967
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,897
Maggie, could I see you alone
for a moment?

968
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,127
Sure.

969
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,795
Excuse us.

970
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,540
Dude.

971
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,574
Look, sweetheart,
I know you blame Ben

972
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,743
for everything that's gone wrong
in the last couple of weeks.

973
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:33,016
Actually, Dad,
I don't entirely blame Ben.

974
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,420
Well, in any case...

975
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:39,628
Ben's the one you've been taking
potshots at all night.

976
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:43,598
I know. Sorry.
It's not my finest hour.

977
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,067
It's just I'm starting to see a side of him
that I really don't like.

978
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,900
Maybe you need
to remind yourself

979
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,600
of all the things that
you do like about him.

980
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,608
After all, you did
agree to marry him.

981
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,974
Yeah, because
I stupidly love him.

982
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,946
And I'm sure he stupidly
loves you too.

983
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,280
He's just so frustrating.

984
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,786
Look, why don't you do
what your mother does

985
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,583
when she's frustrated with me.

986
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,954
Needlepoint's not my thing.

987
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,690
Actually I meant to say
calmly talk things out.

988
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,821
Needlepoint?

989
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,888
Yeah.

990
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,570
So, last January when I didn't take

991
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,801
your mother to Hawaii
to the governors' conference

992
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,741
and she started making
those little pillows?

993
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,644
I can't believe
you're just realizing this.

994
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,978
Okay, this conversation
is not going at all the way I planned.

995
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,986
Let's get back to the table so I can
give your mother the good news.

996
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,453
What good news?

997
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,650
It seems I'm taking her
to Maui this winter.

998
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,250
I'm glad we solved your problem.

999
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,923
Don't worry. I think I may have
a way to solve your problem too.

1000
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,997
- Did you?
- Everything okay?

1001
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,934
- How are you doing?
- Hi, great.

1002
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,495
Ben, I've been thinking.

1003
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,567
If we sit down
with Shel and start...

1004
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,384
How was the rehearsal dinner?

1005
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:20,259
I heard Finique lost the reservations.
Bummer. Strike for gay marriage!

1006
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,231
- I think I have a way to end this.
- Oh, yeah?

1007
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,164
You're gonna want to hear this.

1008
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,226
All right.

1009
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,465
Let's go someplace a little quieter.

1010
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,353
Should I be leaving a trail
of bread crumbs?

1011
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:50,415
Is your plan to take me out here
and hope I can't find my way back?

1012
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:53,860
No, this is real. The governor's willing
to issue a statement in favor

1013
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,127
of civil unions as soon as you call off
the strike. You won, Shel.

1014
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,895
- Did you say "civil unions"?
- Yes.

1015
00:58:58,968 --> 00:58:59,957
No deal.

1016
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,371
What do you mean no deal?

1017
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,430
The governor's going out on a big limb.
What more do you want?

1018
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,533
I want the same thing
you have: marriage.

1019
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,544
Civil unions
are the same as marriage.

1020
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:13,207
And sitting in the back of the bus is
just as comfortable as sitting in front.

1021
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,547
Marriage isn't just
about a beautiful wedding.

1022
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:16,846
There are legal issues--

1023
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,378
tax benefits, health insurance,
property rights, Social Security,

1024
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,118
and other laws that apply
to married couples, not civil unions.

1025
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,352
- Really?
- Really.

1026
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,885
I may have started this
because I was mad, but I've learned a lot.

1027
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,363
You want to make a difference?

1028
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,400
Go talk to the governor
and change his mind.

1029
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,162
I can't do that.

1030
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,569
You know, it makes perfect sense
that your song is "Ben,"

1031
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,234
because it's about a rat, which is
exactly what you turned out to be.

1032
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,800
I hate that song!

1033
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,211
I remember so clearly your face
the day I told you I was coming out.

1034
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,612
You made that rat face!

1035
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,584
It wasn't a rat face.
That was a wince of surprise.

1036
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,643
It was a wince of,
"My brother's a fag!"

1037
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:55,555
Excuse me for not throwing on
the Village People and dancing for joy.

1038
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,890
It was a lot to spring on me.
You're the one who changed, not me.

1039
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:02,193
I didn't change, Ben.
You just started treating me differently.

1040
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,962
- Sometimes, I could just...
- Hit me? Go ahead.

1041
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,902
Thanks to you, Maggie hates me,
half the town's booing me.

1042
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,633
Even Mom's giving me the evil eye.

1043
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,834
You might as well.
You've done everything else!

1044
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,070
Go ahead, hit me.

1045
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,301
Come on, hit me!

1046
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,580
You hit me.
I can't believe you just hit me.

1047
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,782
You told me to hit you.
I thought you wanted me to hit you.

1048
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,018
Ow! I didn't say
you could hit me.

1049
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,653
- It was implicit when you hit me.
- Oh, yeah?

1050
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,465
Not bad for a fairy, huh?

1051
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:55,382
- Wait. Dad's coming.
- Where?

1052
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,046
I can't believe
you still fall for that.

1053
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,022
Break it up. Break it up!

1054
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,456
He started it.

1055
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,526
You so started it.

1056
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,358
You.

1057
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,194
Hey, aren't you
that gay strike guy?

1058
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:13,866
Yeah.

1059
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:17,802
- We're behind you, man.
- Yeah. Can you sign my helmet?

1060
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,365
Yes, I'd be delighted to.

1061
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,483
- There you go.
- "To my gay brother."

1062
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,041
What makes you think I'm gay?

1063
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,178
Sorry, I just assumed.
Let me fix that.

1064
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:36,487
Now it's
"To my not-gay brother."

1065
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,322
Grandy, you made bail.

1066
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,096
The straight one.

1067
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,363
The gay one gets out too.

1068
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,073
Funny how we both chose
to wear concealing hats.

1069
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:58,045
Oh, please, I came this close
to wearing Shel's sombrero.

1070
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,640
Yeah, we'd make a great photo op.

1071
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,652
"Governor's daughter
and Assistant District Attorney

1072
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,281
were seen bailing their respective
boyfriends out of the Big House."

1073
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,756
When Shel said he wanted
to fight for gay marriage,

1074
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,794
I had no idea he meant literally.

1075
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:15,297
I don't think it's about gay marriage
as much as it's about Ben and Shel.

1076
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,388
Oh, yeah.

1077
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,560
Do you think they are ever going
to grow up and forgive each other?

1078
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,330
It's hard to say.

1079
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:25,932
Unfortunately, along with the great hair,
they both inherited a stubborn streak.

1080
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,668
Why couldn't they both
just have been double-jointed?

1081
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,115
It's not my fault.
He's a crazy person.

1082
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,548
A civil union is not a marriage!

1083
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:36,607
You hear that?

1084
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:40,087
He's right. Would you be satisfied
just signing a contract with me?

1085
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,145
I give up.

1086
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,852
I give up. You're the only
sane one of the bunch.

1087
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,587
While you were siding with Shel,

1088
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:48,824
he was trying to help me
talk him out of striking.

1089
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:51,799
I didn't do it for you,
Ben, I did it for Shel.

1090
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,893
Frankly, I think
you're kind of an ass.

1091
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,733
Let's get out of here, shall we?

1092
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,480
I'm sorry we fought
over the marriage thing.

1093
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,747
I don't like being pressured.

1094
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:14,312
Ted, if you love someone,

1095
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,882
the idea of staying together
shouldn't feel like pressure.

1096
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,587
I've been thinking about this.

1097
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:24,156
If we're not in this for the long run,
I'm not so sure I want to be in it at all.

1098
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:28,829
Wait. Shel, why can't we just go
back to the way it was before?

1099
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,932
'Cause I'm...

1100
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,001
not the same person I was before.

1101
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,143
Shel, get in the car.

1102
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,368
Maggie, say something.
We gotta talk about this.

1103
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,529
Ben, right now,
I don't want to talk to anyone.

1104
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,438
I don't want to see anyone.
I just want to be left alone.

1105
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,250
Magpie, your wedding planner
lady called.

1106
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,151
She said she couldn't get doves,
but you shouldn't worry

1107
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,655
'cause she lined up
some trained pigeons.

1108
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,729
<i>It appears the two-week-old gay strike</i>
<i>has actually helped Welling.</i>

1109
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,100
<i>Over 60% of voters</i>
<i>support his decision</i>

1110
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,036
<i>to stand up to the protesters.</i>

1111
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,630
You see? There you go.

1112
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,438
The moral majority's on my side.

1113
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:52,277
Conrad, you know, just because
people disagree with you on this

1114
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:54,839
doesn't mean that they are immoral.

1115
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,008
Me, for instance.

1116
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:00,121
Well, you?
You're on their side?

1117
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,952
It's not them or us, dear.

1118
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,889
We're all the same.

1119
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,056
Frankly, I'm a little disappointed
that you seem to have forgotten that.

1120
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,895
Is that needlepoint?

1121
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,401
Yes, I'm going to cover
the dining room chairs--

1122
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,266
all 12 of them.

1123
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:18,270
I think I'm going to get some air.

1124
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,505
Don't catch cold.

1125
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,383
Governor.

1126
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,826
Sorry, I was-- I wasn't--

1127
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:42,125
Clearly, I was, but, you know,
I didn't yet.

1128
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,727
You know, I often find common ground
with my political opponents,

1129
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:51,432
but I don't very often
find a common tree.

1130
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,909
Nine bathrooms, and you still use a tree.
You really are a man of the people.

1131
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:59,072
I didn't want to go back
in the house yet, you know?

1132
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,207
I'm not very popular
with my wife right now.

1133
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,148
How come you're not
using your parents' RV?

1134
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,210
I'm not popular
with my dad right now.

1135
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,881
That's the toughest thing
about being in politics.

1136
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,949
You don't want to disappoint
the people you love,

1137
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,688
but sometimes it's inevitable.

1138
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,094
Even when you believe
in something in your heart

1139
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,961
you have to hope
they understand.

1140
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,557
To thine own self be true.

1141
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,965
Even when it sucks, huh?

1142
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,060
Even when it sucks.

1143
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:26,541
Look, Shel,
I'm enjoying our little talk here.

1144
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:27,598
I know. I got...

1145
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,379
- See ya.
- Thanks, Gov.

1146
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,611
<i>Now the polls are showing</i>

1147
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:36,242
<i>Welling's tough stance</i>
<i>against the gay strikers</i>

1148
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,910
<i>has put him comfortably</i>
<i>in the lead.</i>

1149
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,423
<i>Let's hope gays will leave the marching</i>
<i>to people with real issues</i>

1150
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,787
<i>and go back to their parades.</i>

1151
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,556
Son.

1152
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,489
I know. I heard.

1153
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,730
My strike is making the governor
even more popular than ever.

1154
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,897
I guess I embarrassed you
for nothing, huh?

1155
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,965
Look, I can't really say
this is easy for me...

1156
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,711
this gay stuff.

1157
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,110
I don't know.

1158
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,413
But I do know I'm proud of you,

1159
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:12,079
taking a stand for something
you believe in.

1160
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,253
But I lost.

1161
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,056
Let me tell you something.

1162
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:22,962
In '86 when our union
went on strike,

1163
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,762
we were out for six months.

1164
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,496
We ended up losing anyway.

1165
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,471
I put my sign down
and went back to work.

1166
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,007
So you think I should go back
to work on the wedding?

1167
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,908
That's between you
and your conscience.

1168
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:40,005
All I'm really trying to say is,
even though we lost,

1169
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:44,542
I'll never regret taking a stand,
and neither should you.

1170
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:47,820
Thanks, Dad.

1171
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,250
Look...

1172
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,694
we went back out
a couple of years later, and we won.

1173
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,597
I mean, you can lose a battle
and still win the war.

1174
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,999
Remember that.

1175
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,635
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you and Mom I was gay sooner.

1176
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:09,937
I'm sorry.

1177
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:14,609
I'm just sorry that you
didn't feel that you could.

1178
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:19,054
You know, there's no secret,
no matter how big,

1179
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,112
could ever come between us.

1180
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,454
You're my son, no matter what.

1181
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,799
Hey, Ben?

1182
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:37,998
It's Magpie.

1183
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,735
Dude, on the phone,
phone, phone.

1184
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,970
Hi, honey.

1185
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,503
Hi, honey.

1186
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,573
Did you sneak out early
because it's bad luck

1187
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,642
to see the bride
before the wedding?

1188
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,448
I got to run out for a while.

1189
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,580
Cool. Hey, even though
the wedding's off,

1190
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,989
can I still wear
the pretty tux today?

1191
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,050
How'd you know about the wedding?

1192
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:01,528
I was on the extension.
I'm the one who blew his nose.

1193
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,263
Out of the way, please.

1194
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,327
Thank you.

1195
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,941
Excuse me, darling.

1196
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:17,706
Have you seen a small Panamanian
gardener with a topiary elephant?

1197
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,577
No, I'm happy to say.

1198
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,912
What are you doing
over here anyway?

1199
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,782
Why aren't you with your rabble,
leading the charge?

1200
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:28,050
The media wants my reaction to the poll.
I'm trying to think what to say.

1201
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:32,122
You can tell them
that you succeeded at one thing--

1202
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,821
the wedding's been put on hold.

1203
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,228
Maggie apparently
wants to call it off,

1204
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:37,925
and no one knows where she is.

1205
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,560
Maggie's called off the wedding?
What happened?

1206
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:43,230
You didn't hear it from me.
I happen to know from a very...

1207
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,503
Thank you.

1208
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,151
Thank you.

1209
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:01,587
Good morning.

1210
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,593
I know it's been a long night,
but in spite of the polls,

1211
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,925
I want you all to know
that everyone here

1212
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,591
and everyone that supported us
around the country

1213
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,293
have made a difference--

1214
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:16,099
an even bigger difference than
I think any of us could have imagined.

1215
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,002
I know I sure couldn't.

1216
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,169
We may have lost the battle...

1217
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:26,243
but in my heart I know
one day we will win the war.

1218
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,684
We'll win because
we're gonna keep trying

1219
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,689
and because the people
and friends and family

1220
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,351
and co-workers we return to
have been put on notice

1221
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,122
<i>that we will not be treated</i>
<i>like second-class citizens</i>

1222
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,924
<i>because of who we love.</i>

1223
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,593
<i>And if you're not out to all the people</i>
<i>in your life, then maybe it's time.</i>

1224
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:49,296
Because those who think gay people

1225
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,635
are out to destroy
the institution of marriage

1226
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,641
don't know us very well.

1227
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,904
We do not destroy.

1228
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,309
We renovate.

1229
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,912
And we are gonna make
marriage stronger

1230
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,613
and even more beautiful than ever.

1231
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:10,051
I may not always agree
with everyone in my family...

1232
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,318
but they are my family.

1233
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,090
And this whole thing started

1234
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:19,396
because I believe everybody
deserves a beautiful wedding.

1235
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:23,165
<i>For better or worse,</i>
<i>that includes my brother.</i>

1236
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,103
<i>There was to be</i>
<i>a wedding here today,</i>

1237
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,540
<i>but it's not gonna happen</i>
<i>without our help.</i>

1238
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,769
<i>Now...</i>

1239
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,042
I'd like to ask y'all a little favor.

1240
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:36,141
Does she have any idea how
embarrassing it would be to cancel now?

1241
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,152
How could she do this to me?

1242
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,284
Oh, and you too, Ben, naturally.

1243
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,918
Okay, I called up all the guests
and gave them the heads-up

1244
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,927
that the wedding may be canceled--

1245
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:50,192
postponed with extreme prejudice.

1246
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,258
I'll be right in there.

1247
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,269
Try her cellphone again.
Maybe she'll answer this time.

1248
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:58,966
My speed dial tries every two minutes.
She just doesn't want to talk to me.

1249
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,568
It's probably just pre-wedding jitters.

1250
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,909
I know I was really nervous
about my honeymoon night.

1251
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,814
Of course, that wouldn't
really be a problem for her.

1252
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,715
It's not jitters.

1253
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,754
She just doesn't want
to marry some oaf

1254
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,585
who's totally unaware
how she's feeling half the time.

1255
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:19,753
Oh, no, dear. If that were true,
no woman would get married.

1256
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,888
I'm calling in the state troopers.
Maybe they can find her.

1257
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,523
I'm surprised she doesn't have

1258
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,034
one of those GPS deals
on her cellphone

1259
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:30,003
so you could locate her
in case of emergency.

1260
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,562
My God, of course she does.

1261
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,504
- You're a genius!
- We'll pinpoint her in two seconds.

1262
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:40,173
If you're calling security, tell them
the gays are invading the south lawn.

1263
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,662
Wait for it.

1264
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,201
It could be cooler.

1265
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,834
Oh, my God.
We have our work cut out for us.

1266
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,741
- What?
- Let's go, gang.

1267
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,302
Get out of the way.

1268
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,815
The lamé, get rid of the lamé!
Anything lamé goes away.

1269
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,808
All right, gentlemen, focus.

1270
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,573
Tenors, little more to your left.

1271
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:49,413
Get in places, and remember,
if you can't see me, I can't see you.

1272
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,418
Okay.

1273
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:53,783
Ted?

1274
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:56,620
What are you doing here,
besides sabotaging the gazebo

1275
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,922
these nice lesbians
just put back together?

1276
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,154
I love you.

1277
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:05,364
I love you so much, and I don't
want to lose you, you crazy man.

1278
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:10,802
I love you too.

1279
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,574
- But... I'm not ready to get married.
- I understand.

1280
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:20,774
I just, uh, you know, moving in
together was traumatic enough.

1281
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:21,838
I know.

1282
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,078
- Just give me some time.
- I'll give you time.

1283
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,712
I am Mr. Time. I'll give you
all the time you need.

1284
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,653
- How much time do you need?
- Shel!

1285
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,419
- What?
- I don't know, I don't know.

1286
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,483
I just, uh... in time.

1287
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:36,088
Okay? Maybe... maybe
I just need a sign.

1288
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,067
Okay, not that kind of sign.

1289
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,828
- Okay.
- Okay.

1290
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,241
Wow. This is gonna be beautiful.

1291
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,778
It sure is.

1292
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:55,112
Ben and Maggie
must be so excited.

1293
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:56,343
Maggie!

1294
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,186
Let's jump in my car right here!

1295
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:10,656
Who's driving this van?
Who's driving this van?

1296
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,240
Maggie.

1297
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,444
Ben, wha--
How did you find me?

1298
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,576
The GPS on your cellphone.

1299
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,985
Only you've been moving around a lot--
I've been chasing you all day.

1300
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:36,217
Listen, sweetheart,
running is not the answer.

1301
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:40,591
I know I've been an idiot,
but please stay and marry me.

1302
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,096
Ben, I-I don't want to get married

1303
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:46,328
until it's a happy occasion
for everyone, including me.

1304
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,598
And I don't know if I'd be happy
marrying someone

1305
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:52,162
who'd take sides
against his own brother.

1306
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,767
You know, Shel didn't
let you down for being gay.

1307
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,278
You let him down by not accepting it.

1308
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,542
But I do accept it. I get it now.

1309
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,311
Okay, I really want
to believe you,

1310
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:04,852
but you're gonna have to
be a little more specific.

1311
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,320
Okay, okay. When you called off
the wedding this morning,

1312
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,620
I knew that I had screwed up
the happiest day of my life.

1313
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,057
And then it hit me:

1314
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,755
that's what I have been trying
to keep Shel from having all along.

1315
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:18,391
Right now, he and I
are fighting for the same thing.

1316
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,662
And I swear to you,
as soon as I stop

1317
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,466
begging you for forgiveness,
I'll start begging him.

1318
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,200
So please,
don't get on that plane.

1319
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:28,503
What-- what-- what plane?

1320
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,170
The plane you were taking.

1321
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:34,409
Oh, actually, I was here
to pick up Stephanie.

1322
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,542
But she missed her flight,
which is fine,

1323
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,609
'cause I no longer
need a maid of honor.

1324
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:43,179
Ben, even if Shel forgives you,
there's no time.

1325
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:49,257
- We can't get married like this.
- Maggie!

1326
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,492
Oh, my God.

1327
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,066
Maggie!

1328
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,034
Maggie!

1329
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:26,399
- Bonnie, thanks!
- Oh, my God.

1330
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,906
- Thanks, girls!
- Yeah, boss.

1331
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,078
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1332
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,008
How did you--?
What did--?

1333
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,414
I can't believe it.

1334
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,349
- This is what I do, Ben.
- No, no, no.

1335
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:48,913
I mean, I can't believe you'd do this
for me, Shel. I'm-- I'm sorry...

1336
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,584
I know. When I have time,
I want to hear the whole apology,

1337
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,220
but right now,
hair and makeup, stat! Let's go!

1338
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:23,013
Wait.

1339
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,724
One more thing.

1340
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,285
I got the rings.

1341
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,973
Wow.

1342
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,718
Wait'll you see where she's
wearing something blue.

1343
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:09,726
Hi.

1344
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:14,870
Second.

1345
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:28,121
We are gathered here to witness

1346
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,454
and to celebrate in holy matrimony

1347
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:33,619
the union of Margaret Welling
and Benjamin Grandy.

1348
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:37,562
<i>It's not unusual</i>
<i>to be loved by anyone</i>

1349
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:43,327
<i>It's not unusual</i>
<i>to have fun with anyone</i>

1350
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:48,673
<i>But when I see you</i>
<i>hanging around with anyone</i>

1351
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,505
<i>It's not unusual</i>

1352
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,912
<i>To see me cry</i>

1353
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,882
<i>I wanna die</i>

1354
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,383
Ed, there's something
I have to do-- trust me.

1355
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:01,081
- Mrs. Welling?
- Just trust me.

1356
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:03,513
Wow.

1357
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:07,551
<i>But when I see you out and about,</i>
<i>it's such a crime</i>

1358
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:13,226
<i>If you should ever wanna be</i>
<i>loved by anyone</i>

1359
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,269
<i>It's not unusual</i>

1360
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,897
<i>It happens every day</i>

1361
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,133
<i>No matter what they say</i>

1362
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,970
I'm gonna throw the bouquet!

1363
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:24,837
<i>You'll find it happens all the time</i>

1364
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:27,746
Come on, you crazy people!
Come on!

1365
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:30,011
- <i>What you wanna do</i>
- Everybody!

1366
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,848
Come on, come on, come on!

1367
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,185
<i>Why can't this crazy love</i>
<i>be mine?</i>

1368
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,246
Ready?

1369
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:38,724
One!

1370
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:39,782
Two!

1371
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:41,351
<i>It's not unusual</i>

1372
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,863
<i>To be mad with anyone</i>

1373
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:50,430
<i>It's not unusual to be sad</i>
<i>with anyone</i>

1374
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:55,704
<i>But if I ever find that</i>
<i>you've changed at any time</i>

1375
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,404
<i>It's not unusual</i>

1376
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:01,711
<i>To find that I'm in love</i>
<i>with you, whoa, whoa</i>

1377
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:06,220
Hi. Um, uh, Vern,
this is Ted, Shel's...

1378
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,085
lover.

1379
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,052
Nice to finally meet you, sir.

1380
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:15,357
Call me Vern.

1381
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,295
So, I hear you're a lawyer.

1382
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:18,832
Prosecutor, actually.

1383
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,060
Oh. Well, that's good.

1384
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,228
I mean, it means
you always got work.

1385
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:26,065
You wouldn't happen
to be a Lutheran, would you?

1386
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:29,974
I am so getting laid tonight.

1387
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,138
Say yes.

1388
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:37,351
I have been, uh,
requested to ask you all

1389
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:41,116
to clear the dance floor
for a very special dance.

1390
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:44,215
So please clear the floor.
Thank you.

1391
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,283
Come on, come on.
Something special.

1392
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:57,604
<i>Ben, the two of us</i>

1393
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:01,938
<i>Need look no more</i>

1394
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,604
<i>We both found</i>

1395
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,910
<i>What we were looking for</i>

1396
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:13,283
<i>With a friend to call my own</i>

1397
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:17,451
<i>I'll never be alone</i>

1398
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,585
<i>And you, my friend, will see</i>

1399
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:24,098
<i>You've got a friend in me</i>

1400
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:29,532
You've got a friend in me

1401
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:33,335
Ben, you're always running

1402
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,809
Here and there

1403
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:41,906
You feel you're not wanted
anywhere

1404
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,917
Anywhere

1405
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:48,820
If you ever look behind

1406
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,654
Shel, this is so beautiful.

1407
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,827
Thank you.

1408
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:59,890
You've got a place to go

1409
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,458
- What?
- Do you mind?

1410
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:05,565
- What do you want? What?
- I thought maybe we--

1411
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,902
I'm not gonna dance with you.

1412
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,840
Dancing with a man
make you uncomfortable?

1413
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,707
Get away from me!

1414
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,509
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.
Let's dance. I lead.

1415
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:14,570
- I lead.
- I lead.

1416
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:15,638
- I lead!
- All right, lead.

1417
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:26,757
Ben, most people
would turn you away

1418
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,796
Turn you away

1419
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:33,926
I don't listen
to a word they say

1420
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,368
A word they say

1421
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:40,772
They don't see you as I do

1422
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,310
I wish they would try to

1423
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:47,747
I'm sure they'd think again

1424
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:53,152
If they had a friend like Ben

1425
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:54,688
Like Ben

1426
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:55,880
Like Ben

1427
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,150
Like Ben

1428
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:00,954
Like

1429
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:05,295
Ben

1430
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,915
But, Shel, the institution of marriage
has been around for a long time.

1431
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,857
- I understand.
- You can't expect it to change overnight.

1432
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,587
Nothing stays the same forever.

1433
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:38,227
But, Shel, it's not like I can
just reverse my opinion.

1434
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,290
I mean, come on, Governor,
why not?

1435
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,531
Well, for one thing, I don't want to.
I want to get reelected.

1436
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,436
So you're against gay marriage...
