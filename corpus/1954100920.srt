1
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,037
Now is the hour...

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,545
...we set into motion cataclysmic change
to the planet.

3
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,580
The legion of doom shall rule
in a new world order.

4
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,339
No one can stop us.

5
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:09,341
I do not understand, Lex Luthor.
I thought we were melting the polar ice caps.

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,538
No, my dear cheetah, the exact opposite.

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,977
As those glaciers swell,
the world's water level shrinks...

8
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,773
...expanding the coastlines
of every continent.

9
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,072
Land we already own.

10
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,680
Another brilliant plan from a brilliant mind.

11
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:29,009
Sorry, Lex, sounds more like an insane plan
from a deranged mind...

12
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,272
...and we're gonna have to put a stop to it.

13
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,606
Justice League, into action.

14
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:52,079
Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman,
get those controls away from Lex.

15
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,907
Cyborg, Batman and Robin with me.

16
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:19,038
Too bad your mind isn't as fast
as your little boots.

17
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,170
We have to destroy those satellites.

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,006
Already on it.

19
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,044
What's going on up there?
Somebody stop them.

20
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:00,605
Two down. Three to go.

21
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,705
-Bizarro.
-Yes.

22
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:10,749
Me here not protecting these satellites
so Lex's plan not come to workness.

23
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:16,108
Um, not sure "workness"
is a word there, genius.

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,839
Me, I'm not genius.

25
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,876
It's Toyman. He's right behind us.

26
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,712
My rocket ship's so much better than yours.

27
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:33,111
Let's see whose toy breaks first. Ha-ha-ha.

28
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,273
Atlantean,
you can't win battles armed with a fork.

29
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,671
Don't make me poke a leak
in that hard head of yours, manta.

30
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,040
I'll hold off Bizarro.

31
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,611
You take out those satellites.

32
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,942
If I can plug in,
I might be able to shut this thing down.

33
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,014
Stay away from my inventions,
you mechanical menace.

34
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,176
I'm putting the batwing on autopilot.

35
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,677
Should keep Toyman busy
while I help cyborg.

36
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,940
Autopilot? But I can fly this thing easy.
I wanna help.

37
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,343
You'll help by staying put.
And don't touch anything.

38
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,912
I'm gonna touch whatever I want.
I'll touch this button and this button.

39
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,944
<i>I</i> heard that.

40
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,277
I will shred that pretty face, Amazon.

41
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:53,607
I have battled harpies
with talons as hard as hydro-fangs.

42
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,441
Your little scratches are almost soothing.

43
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,943
Solomon Grundy crush wonder lady.

44
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:12,373
Now you shall taste your bitter end, cyborg.

45
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,535
You don't even know what bitter means.

46
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,441
Oh. "Stay in the batwing. Stay safe.

47
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,170
Stay out of trouble."

48
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,176
So not fair.

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,346
<i>Please refrain
from kicking the autopilot controls.</i>

50
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,572
<i>- And</i> have a nice flight.
-I'll have whatever kind of flight I want.

51
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,174
Batman's in trouble. Forget this.

52
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,713
- Disengage autopilot.
- Negative.

53
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,404
<i>Your override clearance is not high enough.</i>

54
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,841
How's my clearance now?

55
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,079
Time to play, little birdie redbreast. Ha-ha-ha.

56
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,776
Huh?

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,172
Oh my-

58
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:38,340
- I told you to stay in the batwing.
- What? I was trying to help.

59
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,912
You almost got yourself killed.
How does that help?

60
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:51,572
I will finish this for commander Luthor.

61
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,372
The fool is overloading the satellites.
He has no idea what he's doing.

62
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,114
Embrace winter eternal!

63
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,003
What? No!

64
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,975
Lend a hand? Anyone?

65
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,605
Me hate toys, so me save you.

66
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,578
Time to go.

67
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,973
Yeah, you better run, you big dumb ape.

68
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,410
Whew. That monkey packs a punch.

69
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,373
Superman, it is Lex.

70
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,240
He's gone.

71
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,211
-We have to find him.
-Wait. The blast.

72
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:19,077
It was too powerful.
There's no way he could have survived.

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,947
<i>And</i> so the most notorious <i>villain</i> of all time...

74
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,011
<i>...was defeated that day.</i>

75
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:31,912
<i>As time passed, civilization grew
and prosperity flourished...</i>

76
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:37,312
<i>...thanks to the continued heroics
of Superman and his Justice League.</i>

77
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,346
<i>Even today in the 31st century...</i>

78
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,606
<i>...the mighty legion of super-heroes
battle crime and villainy...</i>

79
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,748
<i>...in the name of truth and justice.</i>

80
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,350
<i>May the historic accomplishments
of Superman be an inspiration to us all.</i>

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,780
When's it gonna be our time, Dawnstar?

82
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,209
When do we get
to join the legion of super-heroes?

83
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,405
One cannot rush the natural progression
of things, val.

84
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,514
Karate kid.
You're supposed to call me karate kid.

85
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,147
If we're ever gonna
become full-fledged superheroes...

86
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,439
...we can start by sticking
to our super-names.

87
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,012
Well, karate kid...

88
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,774
...if lightning lad and the rest of the legion
truly believed we were ready...

89
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,403
...we would be fighting by their side
instead of exploring this museum.

90
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:22,845
But I've studied every martial art ever invented.
I'm ready to go.

91
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,377
What more do they want?

92
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:28,071
There is much more to being a hero
than simply fighting.

93
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:32,477
Tracking lost cats and blessing them with light
doesn't really count as heroics, Dawnstar.

94
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,941
I think it does.

95
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,843
Besides, if the legion of super-heroes
feel we are not ready...

96
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,776
...then we must patiently trust their wisdom.

97
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,379
Heh. Patience? Please.

98
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,208
Check this guy out.

99
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,780
Oh, whoa. Wait. This is Lex Luthor.

100
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,937
It says here his body was found
in the year 2856...

101
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,047
...during the big thaw
of the second warming.

102
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,943
Heh. Look at him.
The leader of the legion of doom.

103
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,377
The sign says not to get too close
to the exhibits.

104
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:11,616
The greatest super villain
of all time? More like Lex loser.

105
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:19,271
There's a weak point
in this chunk of ice right here.

106
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:26,616
I bet with one focused key burst, I can bust
him out and wax the floor with his bald head.

107
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,940
Val, please be careful.

108
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,943
He doesn't look so tough.

109
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,102
Val. Karate kid, stop.

110
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,372
'Hi-ya!
-No!

111
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:45,512
See? I stopped a fraction of an inch
before contact.

112
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,171
-I trained for years to learn that trick.
-You might have broken the ice.

113
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,040
I didn't, did I?

114
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,340
Come. Let us continue to the next hall.

115
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,710
This side of the museum
makes me uncomfortable.

116
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,710
What? Where am I?

117
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,377
What is going on?

118
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,606
Grodd?

119
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,947
Wait. The year 2856.

120
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,104
I've been frozen for nearly a thousand years.

121
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,111
Superman.

122
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,146
It was Fate
that ?Rst bought Superman to our planet.

123
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,041
<i>The innocent baby Kal-El was orphaned...</i>

124
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,737
<i>...when his home planet of Krypton
ceased to exist.</i>

125
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,848
<i>Fortunately, his space crib
was jettisoned to safety and fell to Earth...</i>

126
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,072
<i>...where young Superman was recovered
in a Kansas cornfield...</i>

127
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:32,773
<i>...by his</i> loving adoptive parents,
Martha and Jonathan Kent.

128
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,404
Clark Kent?

129
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,574
Lam never going anywhere
with you ever again.

130
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,339
Aw, come on. Lighten up, Dawnstar.

131
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,207
Whoa. Look at this creepy thing.

132
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,907
Says here, "behind this protective barrier
sits the eternity glass...

133
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:54,038
...which, as legend has it,
was used to bend space and time."

134
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,406
I wish I could use it.

135
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,810
I'd travel to the not-so-distant future,
when you and I are members...

136
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:02,938
...of the legion of super-heroes,
and I can finally put my fighting skills to use.

137
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,276
Val Armorr,
sometimes you are just too exhausting.

138
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:08,776
I know, right?

139
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:12,937
Dawnstar!

140
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,210
Time travel, hmm?

141
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,346
Let's see, now. How does this thing work?

142
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,741
Thou has set the time trapper free.

143
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,575
Speak thy name and desires.

144
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:55,875
I am Lex Luthor,
and I want you to take me back in time.

145
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:59,037
A thousand years ago, to be exact.

146
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,946
<i>As the sands of time run
thy will shall be done</i>

147
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,873
it actually works.

148
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:17,448
Stop. Stop, please.

149
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:24,604
Come along, time trapper.
We have much to do...

150
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,247
...and all the time in the world to do it.

151
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,846
That.... that was Lex Luthor.

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,775
Did he really just go back in time?

153
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,539
-Why didn't you stop him, Dawnstar?
-L....

154
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,202
Never mind. Come on.

155
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,148
Solomon Grundy chest hurt.
Must be cold, dead heart.

156
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,338
Lex gone. What we do?

157
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,606
Not know. Lex is brains.

158
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,840
With no brains,
nobody tell Solomon Grundy what to do.

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,177
Or what not do. So, what we do or not do?

160
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:13,242
I'll tell you what we do. We fight back.

161
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,505
Lex, you here.

162
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,342
Alive and in the flesh.
But where is everyone else?

163
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,970
They all afraid. Hiding.

164
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:27,582
Yeah, they all run away. That why me stay.

165
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:33,149
Those cowards. I'll have to teach them
to never underestimate their brilliant leader.

166
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:43,345
Solomon Grundy,
summon the legion of doom immediately.

167
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,505
-Are we truly a thousand years in the past?
-Looks like it.

168
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:52,912
Lex Luthor,
what thou has asked of me has been done.

169
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:56,742
Now set me free.

170
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,350
Sorry, time trapper, but you work for me now,
on a more permanent basis.

171
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,779
With time trapper under my control...

172
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:13,006
...we can now erase the Justice League
once and for all.

173
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,376
-Come on, let's take him down.
-No, wait.

174
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,514
We have no idea
what these villains are capable of.

175
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:25,640
If this is the 21st century, then there are others
better suited to defeat these miscreants.

176
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:42,805
Val, my tracking abilities will lead us
to the Justice League...

177
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:46,107
...but if you do not stop squirming,
I may drop you.

178
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,769
Just so demeaning.

179
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,544
What gives, Dawnstar? We lost?

180
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,171
Oh, no. We are quite close now.
However, we must be cautious.

181
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:12,407
Remember this is the 21st century,
a time of great ruthlessness.

182
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:16,845
See how they see those torture devices
to flagellate themselves with radioactivity?

183
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,741
Barbarians.

184
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:25,010
Excuse me, can you direct us
to the nearest teleportation pod?

185
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:29,081
Absolutely. You need someplace to go,
I tell you. The hall of justice maybe.

186
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,713
-How do you know where we're headed?
-Yes, how?

187
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:36,009
Um, I think the wings you have
on your back kind of gave it away.

188
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,374
Why don't you just hop in, huh?
I get you there.

189
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,580
You are dressed very creatively.

190
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,241
Why is this teleportation taking so long?

191
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,113
Wait, wait, hold on. What about the fare?

192
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:05,238
Oh, it was better than fair, kind sir.
It was a wonderful ride.

193
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,879
Thank you ever so much.

194
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:12,381
Hey, no. You misunderstand. The money.
Okay? The cash, the dough, the greenbacks.

195
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:16,037
Sorry, pal, we don't have any
of these greenbacks you're talking about.

196
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,148
But if it is any consolation,
I will now bless your vehicle.

197
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,272
Golden light of Amandares, bless and protect
this man in his many travels...

198
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:28,607
...and give him total consciousness
upon his demise.

199
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,606
Whoa. No, no. Aah! Aah! Wait, wait, wait!

200
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:37,443
Aah! Put me down,
you crazy-looking freaky people!

201
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,678
Ahh, might as well level up my tank
and do a little farming.

202
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,945
Our apologies.
Karate kid knows not his own strength.

203
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,013
-I think the front door was locked.
-Intruders!

204
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,741
Are you part of the legion of doom's
intern program?

205
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,641
We are part of no legion.

206
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,337
But we would be if lightning lad
wasn't such a hater.

207
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,535
I knew it.

208
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,038
Stop it. There has been a misunderstanding.

209
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,947
Hey, you can't do that.

210
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,774
Please stop. Please.

211
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,371
You need to learn some welcoming manners,
young man.

212
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,739
What in the name of Rao is going on here?

213
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,073
Somebody needs to start talking now.

214
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,839
These two broke in
and started busting up the place.

215
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,071
That's a lie. He attacked first.

216
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:41,578
Yes, the masked boy speaks
a definite mendacity.

217
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,676
I will get to the bottom of this.

218
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,742
The lasso of truth will not allow you
to speak falsely.

219
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,438
Good, because I have never spoken falsely
in my long life.

220
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,012
Trust me, most times she's too honest.

221
00:20:57,167 --> 00:21:00,705
-Enough banter. Who are you?
-And what are you doing here?

222
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:05,646
I am Dawnstar.
This is val Armorr, also known as karate kid.

223
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,215
We're from the future. The 31st century.
A thousand years from now.

224
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:15,077
The one you know as Lex Luthor
had been discovered in the year 2856...

225
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,839
...during the big thaw
of the second warming.

226
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,504
And apparently my frozen body
was taken to some museum...

227
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:27,845
...where, once freed, I obtained this hourglass
and with it came back in time to the present.

228
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,378
We were lost without you, Lex Luthor.

229
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:35,004
I was lost. Lost and afraid.

230
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,840
As you all should be.

231
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,745
But your presence in this room is a sign
of your undying loyalty to your leader.

232
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,851
Which is more than I can say for black manta
or gorilla Grodd and captain cold.

233
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,346
They're the most pathetic of all.
Too scared to even show up.

234
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,644
Yes, yes, yes. It was the recklessness
of captain cold that caused your near demise.

235
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,074
Never mind them!

236
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:04,978
I have a new ally and most powerful servant.

237
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:14,004
Time trapper, bow to them.

238
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:19,512
Time shall mend all slights.

239
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,378
He's scary and strange. Me like him.

240
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:30,538
Ls he your, ha, ha, plaything?

241
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,117
I will use time trapper's powers
to destroy the Justice League once and for all.

242
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:40,441
Before they even began.

243
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,843
- And that's the whole story.
- What she said.

244
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,206
Fascinating.

245
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:51,340
Just when we believe Lex Luthor dead,
he returns, not from Hades but from the future.

246
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,845
Imagine what the power of time travel
could do in that maniac's hands.

247
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,345
I'd really rather not. Lex has to be stopped.

248
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:03,275
Justice League, we have to move now.

249
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,776
These were all "hold the pickles," right?

250
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,638
Now is the hour.

251
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,874
Time trapper, I now command you
to open a portal to a certain cornfield...

252
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,071
...in Smallville, Kansas, some years ago.

253
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:43,707
<i>As the sands of time run
thy will shall be done</i>

254
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:54,271
legion of doom, you will go into the past...

255
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,346
...and keep the baby Kal-El
from ever falling into the hands...

256
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,107
...of those sickeningly sweet rubes,
Martha and Jonathan Kent.

257
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,770
Guys, you gotta hear this to believe it.

258
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,005
They won't raise the baby,
because you will take him...

259
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:11,775
...put him back in his space crib,
and launch him far, far away from this planet.

260
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:15,608
Thus, Superman will never come
to exist here on Earth.

261
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:19,874
<i>And</i> without Superman,
the Justice League <i>will</i> never be formed.

262
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:25,244
We will have won our greatest victory,
and the world will be ours.

263
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,437
Not if I have anything to say about it.

264
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,137
- The Flash?
- You sound so surprised.

265
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,075
He always shows up first.

266
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:36,545
Forget them. Go.
Change the past as I have commanded.

267
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,839
Ahh. Will someone get Bizarro?

268
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,174
Time trapper, seal the portal.

269
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:52,010
-You won't get away with this, Lex.
-Hurry, before it shuts.

270
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,604
You, protect me.

271
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:26,271
Come, we have work to do.

272
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:31,213
I brought my coupons,
but I can't seem to find them.

273
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:42,377
- Can I help you all with something?
- I believe you can.

274
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,273
I was just about to say,
"we're not in Kansas anymore."

275
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:54,576
But this is the one time that doesn't work.

276
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,907
I don't understand it, not one bit.

277
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:00,604
That this little bugger
would just fall out of the sky?

278
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,179
Oh, Paul, thank goodness he wasn't hurt.

279
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:08,476
- Isn't he just the cutest?
-Sure is, but who does he belong to?

280
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,240
That's Solomon Grundy baby.

281
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,902
Excuse me?

282
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:18,447
The words my loving
and very tall spouse attempts to speak...

283
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,913
...are that you have found our baby,
and we are eternally grateful.

284
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:29,073
Solomon Grundy says thank you
from bottom of inky-black soul.

285
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:34,280
But how'd he get in this spaceship?

286
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:38,176
Oh, that is no spaceship. It is, um....

287
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:44,216
Simply is little baby carriage
his father made for him at the steel mill.

288
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,870
Okay, then.

289
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,938
Thank you very much.
You can go home now.

290
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,014
Nothing to see here. Bye.

291
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,843
Have a nice life.

292
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,877
Mission accomplished.

293
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:14,708
- Hand over the Superbaby.
- And nobody gets hurt.

294
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:19,509
-Except for you four.
-Honey, hold the baby, please.

295
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,271
While I rip their heads off.

296
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,107
Whew.

297
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:18,242
Aw. Superbaby so ugly.

298
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:52,015
If I can just break through his shield.

299
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,677
Don't worry, Superbaby,
we'll get you where you're supposed to be.

300
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,843
Fumble! Baby fumble!

301
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,849
Ma, something strike you
as odd about those two?

302
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,470
Here, Mrs. Kent. Sorry for the ruckus.
Raise this baby with all the love...

303
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:51,706
...you've always raised him with.
I mean, um, no, don't worry about it.

304
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:54,245
Just be you. You're a great parent.

305
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,380
Gotta go. Bye, now.

306
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,077
Mama, mama!

307
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:07,877
- Aah!
- Mama! Ha-ha-ha.

308
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,672
Mama!

309
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:16,217
Me make sure you stay
right here on Earth, Superbaby.

310
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,273
Hello, Superbaby. Hello.

311
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,705
Me doing all wrong.

312
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,702
It is done.

313
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:51,441
The past has changed,
and there is a paradox in time.

314
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,847
Thou should no longer exist
in this time frame.

315
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,948
And I now have the power
to banish thee away.

316
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,046
Superman.

317
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,104
But that is not all.

318
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:15,805
Because there is no Superman
in this timeline...

319
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,777
...there would also be no Justice League.

320
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:31,548
<i>The Justice League is now erased
by mine own hand.</i>

321
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,204
It worked. It worked perfectly.

322
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,941
-They are gone.
-No.

323
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,603
- I'll take them down myself.
- Stop.

324
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:48,216
You saw how time trapper erased
the entire Justice League from existence.

325
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,211
He could do the very same to us.

326
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:55,110
We cannot win this fight. We must go.

327
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:07,280
Legion of doom, l, Lex Luthor,
have eliminated the Justice League.

328
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:11,506
I now give you the world.

329
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,515
We now rule with none to oppose us.

330
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,940
<i>Let anarchy reign. Let us do
with this pathetic planet as we please.</i>

331
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:40,016
It is ours, and there is no one left to stop us.

332
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:57,278
Did you know that most stars in the sky
have died out thousands of years ago?

333
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,812
-What?
-The light takes so long to get here...

334
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,605
...it's already burned out.

335
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,444
We're looking at ghosts in the night sky.

336
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,104
They no longer exist.

337
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,837
Dawnstar, I'm sorry.

338
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,274
If--

339
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:21,439
if I wasn't so hotheaded, I never would have
let Lex Luthor out of the ice in the first place.

340
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,910
None of this would've ever happened.

341
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,637
And I too am sorry.

342
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,839
If only I had been more willing to be brave,
I would have stopped Lex Luthor...

343
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,344
...before he escaped the 31st century.

344
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,178
-We make lousy superheroes.
-Yes. We are nothing like the Justice League.

345
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:42,581
I wish we'd have just disappeared
like they did.

346
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:46,908
Yes, perhaps it would have been better.

347
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:51,880
Wait, that's it.
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

348
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:56,209
-That this tunnel really reeks?
-No. Yes, it does.

349
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,577
But more to the point, what if Lex
no longer belonged to this timeline?

350
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,270
If there was a paradox.

351
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:05,710
Because he truly should not be here
in the first place.

352
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:10,110
Time trapper would send him packing,
vanish him like the others.

353
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:13,771
But more importantly,
the paradox would change everything.

354
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:18,348
If Lex Luthor was never frozen in ice, then
he'd never even make it to the 31st century.

355
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,776
He couldn't come back
and cause all this trouble.

356
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,938
-We'd undo everything that's gone wrong.
-Yes.

357
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,774
All that time, he was lost in those glaciers.

358
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:31,382
Nobody could find him because nobody
was good enough to track him down.

359
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:37,003
If we find Lex now,
we could free him from that ice.

360
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:40,114
He'd never even make it to the 31st century.

361
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:43,737
But we'd need someone strong enough
to break him out.

362
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,073
Let's do this.

363
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,045
I fear we are going in circles.

364
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,875
It took a massive ice thaw
and hundreds of years for civilization...

365
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:10,344
...to find Lex frozen in this wasteland.

366
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,447
How am I to do it in only a few minutes?

367
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,312
-Whoa. Definitely not what we were looking for.
-No.

368
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:21,676
And we all appear
to be looking for the same thing.

369
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:25,873
Captain cold managed
to put our leader, Lex, in this deep freeze.

370
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:30,744
And we will find him first and save him.
I swear it.

371
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,846
Well, sorry, guys, you won't.

372
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,378
It's gonna take nearly a millennia to find Lex.

373
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:38,413
And when it happens,
it definitely won't be by you guys.

374
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:42,242
It is truth. We are from the future
and know this to be fact.

375
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,813
My friend here
is the best tracker in the galaxy.

376
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:50,006
The only way you're gonna find your boss
is if you help us.

377
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:54,172
No, I think better to simply crush you both.

378
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:59,947
I'll hold them off. Keep looking.

379
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:32,769
What are you doing?

380
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:35,277
Keep searching for Lex.

381
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:38,381
But that's just it. I think I found him.

382
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:43,415
-Lex Luther's directly beneath you.
-Then let's finish this.

383
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:40,079
May the warmth of anasissier Talmak
fill you with health.

384
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:54,513
What? What is going on?

385
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:58,080
-You did it.
-No, we did it.

386
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,841
Let's just hope it works.

387
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:14,218
-What are you laughing about?
-The future has been changed by human hand.

388
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,871
Thou no longer belongs in this timeline.

389
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:21,846
It is now within my known power
to banish thee...

390
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,209
...to the ether of nonexistence.

391
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,278
No, this is impossible.

392
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,072
I control you.

393
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,543
No more.

394
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,944
-If you banish me, you'll go too.
-Not so.

395
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,607
For I remain outside the paradox
because it is within my power.

396
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,047
Lex Luthor, thou art banished
by mine own hand.

397
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:53,210
No!

398
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:04,542
<i>As the sands of time run
mine own will shall now be done</i>

399
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,642
I will remake this world in darkness.

400
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,380
We freed Lex Luthor,
but do you think it set everything right again?

401
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,975
That looks like one
of the time trapper's portals.

402
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,704
Only bigger.

403
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:40,613
Oh, no, he must have gotten
his hourglass away from Lex.

404
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,771
Whatever we did,
we must have made it worse.

405
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:50,607
-We must set this right, once and for all.
-Wait. What about the time-paradox stuff?

406
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:57,184
-If he sees us, he'll banish us too.
-I fear we have run out of options.

407
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,703
We have come to stop you, time trapper.

408
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:12,513
Hmm. It seems that
two little paradoxes were missed in all of this.

409
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:19,748
No matter, for thou art too late
to save this world or yourselves.

410
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,279
No one remains who can stop me.

411
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,080
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

412
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,574
-The Justice League.
-Our plan worked.

413
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:56,082
So be it, Justice League.

414
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:13,703
Whoa.

415
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:56,940
I'm getting distress calls
from all over the planet.

416
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,774
I need the three of you
to save as many lives as you can.

417
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,979
The rest of us have to stop the time trapper
once and for all.

418
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,704
Music to my ears.

419
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:41,271
Let's shut this operation down.

420
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,875
-Thanks, kid.
-That's what I'm here for.

421
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:44,047
I could use some big help here.

422
00:44:37,534 --> 00:44:40,981
How do we stop this guy, Dawnstar?
We can't even touch him.

423
00:44:41,634 --> 00:44:45,207
I cannot see the way. But I know you can.

424
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,280
You have the ability
to see the weak point in any object.

425
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:50,845
Focus your key.

426
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,813
If time trapper has a weakness,
you are the only one that can see it.

427
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:08,179
But nothing shows up on this guy.
It's like he has no key or energy.

428
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:13,682
It's all blackness.
The time trapper, he's made of dark matter.

429
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:16,178
There's only one person among us
that can harm him.

430
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:19,780
Me? I cannot, val.

431
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:24,110
All this time you've been telling me
to hold back, but now we need you to strike.

432
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:26,873
Your light energy is the only thing
that can affect him.

433
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:32,776
We need you now.

434
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:23,846
Get the hourglass.
It seems to be his power source.

435
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,980
On it, bats.

436
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,077
Time trapper, time's up.

437
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,844
Turn the hourglass now.

438
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:58,712
Whew. And the Justice League pull off
another fourth-quarter comeback.

439
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:11,247
Whew. Well, since I'm here,
I might as well get some roast pig.

440
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,141
Or some fish tacos.

441
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,042
Oh. Better not tell Aquaman.

442
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:22,046
You two kids did great out there.
You should consider sticking around.

443
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,840
The Justice League could really use
your help in a fight.

444
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,176
Normally, Superman, sir,
I would have jumped at the chance...

445
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:32,008
...but quite frankly,
I think I've learned my lesson.

446
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:34,738
Yes, we must go back where we belong.

447
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,404
Changing what has already occurred
has proven far too dangerous.

448
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:43,175
But fighting along your side has taught us
to face the future with courage.

449
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:47,714
Well, you're always welcome here.
You two are fine young superheroes.

450
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:49,278
You should be proud.

451
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:53,278
Time trapper,
we have one last command of you.

452
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,580
Take us home.

453
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:14,240
I can't help but feel
there's something I'm forgetting.

454
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,044
Going somewhere, Lex?

455
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,206
Cold. So cold.

456
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:34,840
Don't worry, Batman's volunteered a nice
warm cell for you at Blackgate prison.

457
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:42,183
Looks like everything
is back to normal, but Lex is getting locked up.

458
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:45,679
He may as well be lost to us
if that is the case.

459
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:48,440
No, you two lack vision.

460
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,103
This experience
has taught us more about the future...

461
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:54,111
...than even my intellect could foresee.

462
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:56,679
We will regroup with the others.

463
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:01,680
And the legion of doom
shall have our revenge.

464
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:12,238
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad to be
back where everything is peaceful for once.

465
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,244
-Even if it is a little boring.
-Wait.

466
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:17,837
Lex Luthor.

467
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,911
I thought we set everything right.

468
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:22,911
But we must have missed some little thing.

469
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:27,243
You know, Superman did tell us
we're welcome back any time.

470
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,406
Then let us return in time,
to the hall of justice.
