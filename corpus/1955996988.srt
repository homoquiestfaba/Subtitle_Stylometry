1
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,791
<i>Welcome back, hockey fans.</i>

2
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>If you're just joining us,</i>
<i>we're broadcasting live</i>
<i>from the ZHL Draft,</i>

3
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,921
<i>here in beautiful
Anchorage, Alaska.</i>

4
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,589
For those of you at home,
keeping score,

5
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,632
<i>we've completed
the first 10 rounds.</i>

6
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,342
That's right.
And the deal-making
behind the scenes

7
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,802
<i>has been fast and furious.</i>

8
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,387
The general managers
for both,

9
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,639
<i>the LA Carjackers
and the Seattle Simians</i>

10
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,349
have just
brokered a deal.

11
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>LA star center man
Rob Poirier has been traded</i>

12
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>for the Seattle Simians'
first rounder,</i>

13
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,230
<i>Sergei Bubalochov.</i>

14
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,858
Along
with the trade for Poirier,
I would have to say, Bruce,

15
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,317
<i>that the Simians'
choices thus far</i>

16
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,528
<i>have been interesting,
to say the least.</i>

17
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,114
<i>Now,</i>
<i>another of the Simians'</i>
<i>new acquisitions</i>

18
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,365
<i>is goaltender
Max "Mad Dog" Brady</i>

19
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>from the Sault Ste. Marie
Buccaneers.</i>

20
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,619
Mad Dog! Mad Dog! Mad Dog!

21
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,419
<i>Then,
there's Tyson Fowler.</i>

22
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,797
<i>Some of you</i>
<i>hardcore hockey fans</i>
<i>may not know his name</i>

23
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,633
<i>but he's actually</i>
<i>the reigning World</i>
<i>Figure Skating Champion.</i>

24
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,844
<i>Fowler surprised the</i>
<i>sports world by announcing his</i>
<i>retirement from figure skating</i>

25
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,055
<i>to pursue his</i>
<i>life-long dream of playing</i>
<i>professional hockey.</i>

26
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
<i>And don't forget
the Swedish sensation,</i>

27
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,984
<i>Olaf Schikedanz.</i>

28
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,359
Olaf! Olaf! Olaf!

29
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,367
<i>Well, certainly,</i>
<i>Seattle Simians will be an</i>
<i>interesting team to watch.</i>

30
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,535
<i>You're right there, Bruce.</i>

31
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,746
Jack? Louie?

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,794
Jack! Louie!

33
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,422
<i>And now we're going back
live to the draft.</i>

34
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,175
<i>- That's right, Clark.
- Just in time, too.</i>

35
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,052
Bud Fulton,
the GM and owner of
the Seattle Simians,

36
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,513
<i>is about to make
his final pick.</i>

37
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,682
Hope you boys
aren't watching TV again.

38
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,020
Where are you two?

39
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,484
Jack! Louie!

40
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,446
<i>This player was
a scoring sensation</i>

41
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,158
<i>with the Junior B Nelson
Golden Nuggets.</i>

42
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,492
Hey!
<i>He led the</i>
<i>team to victory</i>

43
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,077
<i>in last year's Harvest
Cup Championship.</i>

44
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,287
Jack...

45
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,413
Louie...

46
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,666
You have until three
to open this door.

47
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,335
One...

48
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,879
Two...

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,797
Two and a half...

50
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,008
Two and three-quarters...

51
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,259
It is my distinct pleasure

52
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,636
<i>to announce
that the final pick</i>

53
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:06,140
for the Seattle Simians
in this year's ZHL Draft...

54
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,059
So this is where you
boys have been hiding.

55
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,476
...is

56
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,644
Jack.

57
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,941
Oh, come on!

58
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,611
Jack!

59
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,285
They mean you?

60
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,363
Are you sure this is what
you really wanna do?

61
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,369
Oh, Jack,
we're gonna miss you.

62
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,139
Jack? Welcome
to Seattle!

63
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,390
I'm Leo.

64
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,933
Coach sent me
to get you.

65
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,643
I think you're
gonna like Seattle.

66
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,769
Through there?

67
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,272
Ah, come in,
come in.

68
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,150
Ah! Ha-ha!

69
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,444
Leo! How's our
new player doing?

70
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,488
Mr. Fulton, Jack.

71
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,615
Jack, Mr. Fulton.

72
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,327
Pleased to meet you, Jack.
You can call me Bud.

73
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,579
Uh...

74
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,999
I think you're
gonna need this.

75
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,877
Welcome to the
Simians, Jack.

76
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,461
Now, Jack,
I wanna introduce you

77
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,629
to the rest of the players
and your coach.

78
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,765
All right!
Nice shot!

79
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,934
Hey, Coach!

80
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,229
Your new player
has arrived.

81
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,982
You mean mascot,
don't you?

82
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,525
Oh, no, no!
Jack's a real player.

83
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,572
Gentlemen, I'd like
to introduce you
to Jack.

84
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,032
Your new teammate.

85
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,034
Looks like
your girlfriend, Tony.

86
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,327
Gnarly.

87
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,495
Would you like a hotdog?

88
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,208
Jack's gonna be
wearing number 99

89
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,378
and a half.

90
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,171
Come on, Jack.
Let's get you suited up.

91
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,260
We're never gonna evolve
as a team with a monkey.

92
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,262
He can't be serious.
Look, it's Fulton's idea.

93
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,013
I have no intention
of playing him.

94
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,015
I'm not gonna be
made a fool of.

95
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,393
If he's on
the ice tonight,
I won't be.

96
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,518
You got it?

97
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,196
<i>Well, here we</i>
<i>are, back at the first ever</i>
<i>Seattle Simians game.</i>

98
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,656
Yes, and it's been
a disappointing game
so far, Bruce.

99
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,785
<i>Simians are down,
two to nothing.</i>

100
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,870
- Come on, Simians!
- Start playing hockey!

101
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,539
Get your popcorn,
peanuts here.

102
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,917
Bring back
the Zamboni driver.
Peanuts?

103
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,838
You guys stink!

104
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,257
<i>Well, the crowd
certainly isn't happy</i>

105
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,426
<i>after that last goal.</i>

106
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>Here we go.
Face off at center ice,</i>

107
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,761
<i>Poirier wins the draw...</i>

108
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,679
Poor Jack,
he's still on the bench.

109
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,570
Oh, and that's
a picture-perfect goal!

110
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,030
Oh!

111
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,865
Let's go, guys!

112
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,659
Come on, get the lead out,
you losers!

113
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,374
Way to work, boys.
Way to work.
I like it.

114
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,126
Yes! Yes! Yes!

115
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,043
Give me that.

116
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,219
- Miller.
<i>- Miller.</i>

117
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,637
Fans look unhappy.

118
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,808
Bad business to have
unhappy fans.

119
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,143
It's only
the first game.

120
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,520
I can see the
headlines already.

121
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,355
Put Jack in.

122
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,730
You gotta
be kidding.

123
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,399
And that's an order.

124
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,318
Hey, Coach. What,
are you ordering fries?

125
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,196
Jack.

126
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,822
You're up.

127
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,910
<i>Wow!</i>
<i>I can't believe it!</i>
They're putting him on!

128
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,539
<i>It looks like Miller</i>
<i>is sending Jack</i>
<i>onto the ice!</i>

129
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,790
Miller!
Didn't know your kid
could play hockey!

130
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,670
Hey, look,
they're putting in Jack.

131
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,880
Hey, over there!
Look, look!

132
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,632
Hey, your player
needs a shave!

133
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,674
He's on?

134
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,636
He looks like
a real swinger, this one.

135
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,765
Is that a monkey?

136
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,271
I told you,
I'm not gonna be on
the ice with a monkey.

137
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,481
It's Fulton's call.

138
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,154
Let's show them, huh?

139
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,823
You can do it, Jack!

140
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,409
Hey, somebody
paint the puck yellow.

141
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,659
He'll think it's a banana.

142
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,164
Hey, little monkey!

143
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,503
Jack, I'm open!

144
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,596
He scored!

145
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,930
<i>Jack
fed Fowler a beautiful pass</i>

146
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,474
<i>reminiscent of a close
relative, number 99.</i>

147
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,227
All right, Carjackers.
Enough monkeying around.

148
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,686
Let's show these Simians
who's in charge of the ice.

149
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,525
Guy's good.

150
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,110
Jack,
pass me the puck!

151
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,945
<i>Jack passes it
out front to Schikedanz,</i>

152
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,986
<i>shoots and scores!</i>

153
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,906
Yay! We scored!

154
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,125
I'm out of here.

155
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,543
<i>And here come
the Simians again,</i>

156
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,629
<i>Jack's got the puck,</i>
<i>moving up ice</i>
<i>to Fowler now...</i>

157
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,423
<i>And what</i>
<i>the heck is Fowler</i>
<i>doing out there?</i>

158
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,550
<i>I think it was
a double-axle, Bruce.</i>

159
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,760
Somebody hit
fancy feet!

160
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,313
<i>And that's
three assists for Jack.</i>

161
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,148
<i>He is putting on
quite a show!</i>

162
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,416
Ha-ha, sorry,
I didn't mean that.

163
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,793
Jack, happy birthday.

164
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,755
I got ya.

165
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,758
Oh, you.

166
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,888
<i>He shoots.
He scores!</i>

167
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,560
<i>Right at the buzzer,
and the Simians win!</i>

168
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,770
- Ah! Champagne!
- Champagne!

169
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,945
You guys
think it's okay

170
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,657
to be beaten
by a chimp?

171
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,701
'Cause I
sure as heck don't!

172
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,494
Nice game,
guys, nice game!

173
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,999
One question.
Excuse me, guys.
Out of my way.

174
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,627
Hey, Poirier,
did you leave the ice early
tonight because of Jack?

175
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,463
Well, let me ask you.
Would you play
with a monkey?

176
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,090
<i>Well, I think</i>
<i>it'll be a great first</i>
<i>season for the Simians.</i>

177
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,801
We've assembled
an excellent team
to the draft,

178
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,304
and we have
a very effective
secret weapon.

179
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,855
Jack, pass me the puck.
Come on, I'm open!

180
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,691
I'm not open anymore.
Let's get that monkey.

181
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:36,858
Jack, look out!

182
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,031
He's okay!

183
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,873
High five!

184
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,514
Yeah! Yeah!

185
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,932
Yeah!

186
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,524
Do I have any lice?

187
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,401
Does Jack do shiatsu?

188
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,111
Jack can hear him call that?

189
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,738
- That was me.
- Bananas, man.

190
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,034
<i>Poirier is on net
with a breakaway.</i>

191
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,994
<i>He spins, goes the
back way...</i>

192
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,747
<i>Oh! Oh! It's
off the post.</i>

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,794
Excuse me, guys,
get out of the way.

194
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,087
Forget about it, guys.
It's just Poirier.

195
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,297
See if we can get
a reaction out of this guy.

196
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,840
Hey! Number 11!

197
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,091
Hey. Rob Poirier.

198
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,760
Well, Rob,
did you ever think

199
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,886
you'd get, uh,
chumped by a chimp?

200
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,691
<i>♪ I'm all smiles...</i>

201
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,866
Another
chocolate?

202
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,534
Sure.
Make it a double.

203
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,080
<i>♪ I don't need... ♪</i>

204
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,999
Hey, excuse me,
are you one of
the Simians?

205
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,585
Well, we were wondering
if you could get

206
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,961
Jack to autograph
something for us.

207
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,683
You have a king?

208
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,518
Go fish.

209
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,940
Do you have
an ace?

210
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,177
Sorry.

211
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,483
You know,
I gotta tell you, Clark,

212
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,652
<i>I have not seen hockey</i>
<i>fans this excited about</i>
<i>a player.</i>

213
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,863
<i>Jack's popularity
has not stopped rising.</i>

214
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,330
Daddy misses
you too, sweetheart.

215
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,332
Good night.

216
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,044
This your family?

217
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,387
Guess I never
thought about a chimp
having a family before.

218
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,105
Hey, Jack,
what are you
up to tonight?

219
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,072
Two chocolate shakes
with cherries.

220
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,074
Thanks.

221
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,458
I'm hoping I get traded back
to Los Angeles next year.

222
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,086
So I can be
with my family.

223
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,392
Hey, kids.

224
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,434
You wanna meet Jack?

225
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,356
Oh, dude,
that's awesome!

226
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,107
Thanks.
Sweet.

227
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,329
Yeah!

228
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,501
Get your bananas here!

229
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,962
We got fresh
bananas here!

230
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,338
Sorry.

231
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,132
Over here!
Over here! Yeah!

232
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,969
Okay, Jack,
so now that we have
the quad down,

233
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,428
let's try a sit-spin.

234
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,358
I'm doing it,
Fowler, look at me,
I'm spinning.

235
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,528
How's it going, Fowler?
Well, that's a start.

236
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,200
Come on, Olaf!
Fowler, I can't
see anymore!

237
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,911
The whole wide world
is spinning, Fowler!

238
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,831
Jack! Jack! Jack!

239
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,667
Yeah! Jack!

240
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,836
What are you doing?
Pass me the puck!

241
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:35,926
You don't see that often!

242
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,183
Find your focus.
Find your focus.
Okay.

243
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,937
Fowler, I'm fine now.
There you go.

244
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,136
<i>Well, here it is,</i>
<i>Clark, the last game</i>
<i>of the season</i>

245
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,219
before playoff time.

246
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,679
<i>Yes, siree.</i>

247
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,556
<i>Coach Skinner
has to be wondering</i>

248
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,350
<i>what his team has to do
to beat Jack and the Simians.</i>

249
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,312
<i>I mean, Seattle's won
all four games this season.</i>

250
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,439
<i>Jack</i>
<i>comes around the net,</i>
<i>he shoots, scores!</i>

251
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,942
<i>And the Simians take
the one-nothing lead.</i>

252
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,234
<i>I'm telling you, Bruce,</i>

253
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,320
<i>Jack definitely has
the Carjackers' number.</i>

254
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,698
Knox.
Hmm.

255
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,744
It's time to
end this folly.

256
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,912
No problem.

257
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,455
You remember the plan?

258
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,665
Yeah. Get the monkey
into the net, and, uh...

259
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,459
And then pull
the net over you

260
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,919
so the ref can't see
what you're doing.

261
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,337
Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

262
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,925
Let's go, Jack.

263
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,933
Go get him!
Come on!
Yeah!

264
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,603
Come on, Jack.
Put it there.

265
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,648
Go, Knoxy!

266
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,690
Jack! Watch out!

267
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,026
Jack!

268
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,444
Jack!

269
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,658
Yes!

270
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,993
Jack!

271
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,206
Ouch!

272
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,750
What's going on?

273
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,460
He bit me!
The chimp bit me!

274
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,005
The chimp bit my player!

275
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,717
- What happened?
- He bit me. Jack.

276
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,301
If it wasn't
for this glove, I would
have lost my hand.

277
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,014
Well, Miller, it seems
that your little mascot

278
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,724
has just bitten
my player.

279
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,933
What are you
talking about?

280
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,102
I want this animal
thrown out of the game.

281
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,079
You gotta
be kidding. Ref?

282
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,980
Number 99
and a half?

283
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,065
You're out
of the game.

284
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,608
Oh!

285
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,319
Come on, Knox.
Let's make sure your
hand's okay.

286
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,456
Tell us
what happened.

287
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,498
I didn't actually
see it.

288
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,771
Jack.

289
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,358
Jack, I think it's
better if you wait in
the dressing room.

290
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,494
We'll be having
a full inquiry
into this investigation.

291
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,330
Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen, for coming.

292
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,831
That monkey
is an animal.

293
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,708
He bit my player.
What's he gonna
do next?

294
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,252
Take off a head? Huh?

295
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,837
The ZHL should've
never let a chimp play
in the first place.

296
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,589
What
is the ZHL's policy?

297
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,174
They should
kick him out of the league.

298
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,675
You wouldn't have
anything to do with this,
would you, Skinner?

299
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,969
Are you accusing me?

300
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,097
Are you accusing me
of setting up a monkey?
Are you crazy?

301
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:11,224
- I'm reporting you!
- I'm reporting you!

302
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,314
Coach Miller,
what are your thoughts
on the Jack incident?

303
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,564
I'm not gonna
make any comment

304
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,150
until there has been
a proper enquiry.

305
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,026
Oh, come on,
Miller, stop dodging
the question.

306
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,987
Look, I've been assured
by Commissioner Pasquela

307
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,490
that the ZHL is gonna
launch a proper and
full investigation.

308
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,742
But, I'll tell you this.
If Jack did bite that player,

309
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,786
the Simians will take
all the appropriate actions.

310
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:32,870
Where is Jack?

311
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,333
Something smells fishy to me.

312
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:43,923
Jack?

313
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,427
Jack!

314
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,333
- Jack?
- Jack?

315
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,917
Jack!
Come on, Olaf.
Hurry up.

316
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,891
Go that way.

317
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,475
Jack!

318
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,601
Jack!

319
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,649
Jack!
Jack!

320
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,861
I don't know.

321
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,196
You go that way.
I'll go this way.
All right.

322
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,488
We'll find him.
Jack!

323
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,762
Hello, Ben,
it's you.

324
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,222
Important job today.

325
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,264
You get to work
for the cops!

326
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,392
Hot off the presses!

327
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,272
The cops are
looking for him?

328
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,940
He bit some
hockey player.

329
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:48,982
Is he dangerous?

330
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,193
He's a hockey player!

331
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,071
Go on, get them
posters up!

332
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,865
I'll cough up
another $3

333
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,867
if you get them
all posted by 5:00.

334
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,285
Thanks, Mr. Raheja.

335
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,917
We're not open yet!

336
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,419
Um, excuse me.

337
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,629
I'm with the Department
of Child Services.

338
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,172
I don't have any children.

339
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,674
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

340
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,804
Sorry to bother you,

341
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,599
but I'm looking
for a young boy.

342
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,143
What did he do?
He's a runaway.

343
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,770
He ran away
from a foster home.

344
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,647
Unfortunately, his mother
died a year ago.

345
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,816
They tell me he loves
to skateboard.

346
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,403
Are you sure you
haven't seen him?
His name is Ben.

347
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,862
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

348
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,615
Well, unfortunately,
at his age,

349
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,784
few children are adopted,
so I'll have to find him
another foster home.

350
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,122
If I see him,
I'll give you a call.

351
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,291
Oh, thank you,
Mister... Uh...

352
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,293
Plant. Oliver Plant.
Mr. Plant.

353
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,334
I'll just leave
you my card.

354
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,047
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.

355
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,637
Dad!

356
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,055
Hey, Suzanne.
Careful!

357
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,073
Oh, I'm starving.
Thanks, Nick.

358
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,115
Ketchup?

359
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,044
Can I get a dog?
All right.

360
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,848
Hey, kid!

361
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,932
Didn't you
see the sign?

362
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,935
I don't know
what it means.

363
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,936
No posters.

364
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:15,814
Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,193
How come you're
not in school?

366
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,404
We just moved
here from Alaska.

367
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,780
I'm starting school
next week.

368
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,865
Alaska, huh?

369
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,534
There's my mom now.
Gotta go.

370
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,577
Hey, hey! Wai...

371
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,501
Oh, no!

372
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,420
Jack's missing!

373
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,218
<i>Unfortunately, Julie,</i>
<i>the police have</i>
<i>no leads so far.</i>

374
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,136
<i>But we were looking
for Jack all day.</i>

375
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,178
We'll go back out
after the game.

376
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,848
Call me when
you hear something.

377
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,974
Yeah, I'm sure
we'll find him soon.

378
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,184
Okay.

379
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,117
Okay!

380
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,745
What do you think?

381
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,955
Awesome.
Yeah?

382
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:55,997
You'll probably need
a couple of these.

383
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,337
I'll be closing up
five minutes.

384
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,464
Okay.

385
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,716
So, you want this
on your sponsor account?

386
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,384
Yeah.
Thanks, Ollie.
Oh, no. Thank you!

387
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,226
Good choice!

388
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,145
That's my favorite.
I'll give it to you
for 50 bucks.

389
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,982
Thanks.
Can't afford it.

390
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,953
Are you going?
Huh?

391
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:35,995
We'll be at
the competition.

392
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,581
Neil won last year.

393
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,254
So, Neil, if
you're not gonna be
using this board,

394
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,798
I'm just gonna
throw it out back
in the dumpster.

395
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,509
All right.

396
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,695
What the...

397
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,988
What the...
What the heck's goin' on?

398
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,449
Jeez.

399
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,192
I've got to find
another alley.

400
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,937
And he 5-0s the ramp,

401
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,648
fakie rocks the spine,

402
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,441
and ollies to flat.

403
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,985
The crowd goes wild.

404
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,945
Yeah!

405
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,089
Night, Mom. Love you.

406
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,135
So, do you
want to try it?

407
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,396
Come on!
Right over here.
Do it here.

408
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,903
Nice and slow.
You got it.
You got it.

409
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,530
Keep your balance.

410
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,424
We'll have this roll-in
done in no time.

411
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,103
Perfect.

412
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,944
We should get you
your own skateboard.

413
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,627
Shh.

414
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,555
Don't worry.
This isn't stealing.

415
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,016
This is old stuff
that they've thrown away.

416
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,828
Just need
one more wheel.

417
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:08,757
Hello?

418
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,656
I got it!

419
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:36,911
Let's get out of here!

420
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,006
How's this?

421
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:07,942
This is you, isn't it?

422
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,742
Looks like,
you're wanted.

423
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,289
You don't seem dangerous.

424
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,918
I know what it's like
to have people looking
for you for no reason.

425
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,297
I won't tell anyone.

426
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,562
Come on, Jack!

427
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,417

<i>Bud Fulton has joined us

00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,756
<i>- Bud?
- Hello.</i>

432
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:15,218
It's been some time since
Jack's gone missing, and

433
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,181
we at the Seattle Simians
would like nothing more than
to see him returned home.

434
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,184
If you have any information
regarding the whereabouts
of Jack,

435
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,394
<i>please contact the Simians
immediately.</i>

436
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,151
We're never gonna
find Jack this way.
It's been days!

437
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:32,944
We're not gonna give up
until we find Jack.

438
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,948
Okay, let's go
this way.

439

442
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Has no one seen him?

443
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,757
Not yet.

444
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,926

see one of the posters
and call.

come back yet.

00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,094
Darn.

525
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:57,680
Sorry about that.

526
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,892
I'll keep my eyes
on the road.

527
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,644
Doc says
I need these glasses,

528
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,103
but I don't like 'em.

529
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,064
Heck, I've been driving
this road for 40 years.

530
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,567
In fact, I told him
I could do it blind...

531
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,444
If I had to.

532
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,529
<i>♪ I'm hitting
the road again ♪</i>

533
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,417
Right this way, ma'am.
Be careful.

534
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,590
Wow. I never knew
this was here.

535
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,343
It's cool.

536
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,594
Let's go
check out that shack
over there.

537
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,303
Oh, yeah.
Good idea.

538
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,098
Phew.

539
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,060
Go ahead.

540
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,231
Wow. Would you look
at this?

541
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
Hey.

542
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,701
Hmm.
Looks like we found him.

543
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,619
It sure does.

544
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,496
Skate park.

545
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:12,755
All right.

546
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:15,675
And...
That should do it.
Here we go.

547
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:19,054
It's fine.
It's fine.

548
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,513
We can't wait around
here all day.

549
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,098
He's bound to show up
eventually.

550
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,766
You'll alert me
when he shows up?

551
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,560
Believe me. No problem.
This place'll
be under 24-hour watch.

552
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,901
They found us, Jack.

553
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,153
They're gonna separate us.

554
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,197
They'll make us go back.

555
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:24,577
Now, what are
we gonna do?

556
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:27,080
I was gonna enter
that competition tomorrow.

557
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:28,664
I was gonna get sponsors

558
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,207
so I could take
care of us, Jack.

559
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,512
Thanks, Jack.

560
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,555
But I can't use this.

561
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,142
There's no pop in it.

562
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,768
I won't be able
to do the tricks.

563
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,365
Jack! What are you doing?

564
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:09,122
Jack?

565
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,298
Jack! Wait up!

566
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:21,843
Jack!

567
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:29,642
Jack, what are
we doing here?

568
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,897
No one would throw out
a good enough board
for the competition.

569
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:41,237
You're gonna
like that board.

570
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:44,949
All right, Ollie.
That's great.
Thank you.

571
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,034
Thanks, man.
Thanks.

572
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,492
Yeah.

573
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,962
Jack, we gotta
get out of here.

574
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,303
Well, hello there.

575
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,806
Uh... I was
just looking
for something.

576
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,308
In my dumpster?

577
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:15,063
I... I'd better go.

578
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,647
Oh, no, hold on.
Wait a minute.

579
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:17,690
Wait a minute.
Come here.

580
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:20,985
Just tell me
what's going on.

581
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,445
Well, I broke
my board.

582
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,822
No kidding.

583
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,700
And I was gonna
enter this
competition...

584
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,038
But I can't
afford a
new board.

585
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,874
Why don't you
show me what
you can do?

586
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:37,834
Show me
what you got.

587
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,171
I don't have
a board.

588
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,966
Oh, yeah.
Hold on
a second.

589
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,176
Don't go anywhere.

590
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,780
How about this?
Will this work?

591
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,364
Sure, I guess.

592
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,643
This board's great.

593
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,775
Would you like to use
that board in the
competition tomorrow?

594
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,360
Seriously?

595
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,325
Holy Toledo! That's
a monkey! It's an ape!

596
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,660
Oh, that's Jack.
He's a friend.

597
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,929
So where are you
living, then?

598
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:13,430
At the old pool.

599
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:16,684
All by yourself?

600
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,644
Oh, no.
Jack lives with me,

601
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:22,231
but everybody's
after him.

602
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,732
They think
he's dangerous.

603
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,408
Well, you know,
it's getting a
little late,

604
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,203
and maybe we can
talk some more
in the morning.

605
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,288
Why don't you
guys bunk out
upstairs in the loft?

606
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,547
Good night, Ben.
Good night.

607
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:08,944
How did Ollie
know my name?

608
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,907
Jack, we gotta
get out of here.

609
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,493
What if he calls
the cops in
the morning?

610
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,954
We gotta go now.

611
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:28,464
If you think we
should stay,
I'll stay.

612
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,513
Night, Mom.
Love you.

613
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,601
Night, Jack.
Love you.

614
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,676
<i>Hello?</i>

615
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,512
Hello, Barbara?

616
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,889
Yes, this is

617
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:21,225
Yes. Plant. Oliver.

618
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,018
Um...
<i>What's up?</i>

619
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:25,854
I think I know
where Ben is.

<i>♪ Hey, buddy,
don't you worry about me</i>

621
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:38,242

00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,994
<i>♪ As anybody can be ♪</i>

623
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:55,968
Morning, Jack.

624
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:59,013
Do you want to whip
up some pancakes?

625
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,618
How do pancakes sound?

626
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:25,831
Jack, what a mess!

627
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,719
Want to use
my razor?

628
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,555
Looks like you
might need
a shave, too.

629
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,454
I'll wait for
you right here

630
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,164
in case you
need something.

631
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:34,567
Hey, look who it is!

632
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:36,985
- Jack?
- Little dude!

633
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,530
Jack! Where you been?

634
01:01:39,572 --> 01:01:41,823
It's Jack!
Oh, man,
he looks great!

635
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,992
Jack, where'd you get
those boots?

636
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,412
Hey! Hey!

637
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:52,209
Cool boots, Jack.

638
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:54,002
You got gum too...
What's all the
commotion?

639
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,089
Hey, Coach,
can Jack play?

640
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,424
Come on, Coach.

641
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:01,427
Get Jack ready
for the warm-ups.

642
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:04,388
All right,
let's go, Simians!

643
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,307
Go Simians!
Come on, Simians.

644
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,267
Jack is back.

645
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,148
Let's go, Jack.

646
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,567
Jack?

647
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:18,152
What's wrong
with Jack?

648
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,446
Are you okay?

649
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:21,738
Is Jack all right?

650
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,701
That's all
right, Jack.

651
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,994
Just a little rusty.

652
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,745
Yeah, skate
like Russki.

653
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:33,750
Come on, Jack.
Let's get 'em.

654
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,835
I think he had
a bad banana.

655
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,381
Jack? Jack!

656
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,260
Are you sure
you're all right?

657
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:48,765
What's all that
commotion
on the ice?

658
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,810
Is that Jack?

659
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:55,063
Come here.
Come on.
I'll help you.

660
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,399
Jack. Jack,
stop with
the stick.

661
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:00,944
Hey, Olaf, I'm
a little concerned
about Jack.

662
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,197
Have you noticed
the way he's skating?
Yeah.

663
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,365
And the way he's
holding his stick?

664
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,491
Jack no good.

665
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:07,702
Hey, Jack.
Looking good.

666
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,665
Come on, Jack.
We'll eat some
snow off the ice.

667
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:13,832
It'll make us feel
good. Come on.

668
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:14,916
Don't get your lips
stuck to the ground.

669
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:15,958
Come on now.

670
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,586
Ready?

671
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:22,799
Maybe come in
a little bit closer.

672
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:26,470
Okay, there you go.
All right.

673
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:30,015
Show us
what you got!

674
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:34,144
Remember that
one, Jack?

675
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,896
Stay down on
your knees,
stay strong.

676
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,024
Come on, Jack,
we're starting
real simple here.

677
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,859
We're on two feet,
remember? Just...

678
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,820
Jack, I don't
want to eat
anymore snow.

679
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,406
Quit pushing my
face into the thing.

680
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:48,075
I don't want any
more snow! No, Jack,
no! No, no, Jack!

681
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,538
Let's go, boys.

682
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:55,791
I smell victory.

683
01:03:58,377 --> 01:03:59,836
Hey, ref.

684
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,339
What's up,
Skinner?

685
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,507
That's Jack.

686
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:04,800
What's he doing
out there?

687
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,927
The ZHL has
already banned him.

688
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,053
I'll check it out.

689
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,555
Yeah, you do that.
You check it out.

690
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,732
This is Mandy
Parker coming to
you from Seattle

691
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:21,483
with the regional
qualifying trials

692
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,819
for skateboarding's
national championships.

693
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,320
This is the first step

694
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,905
for some of the
hottest young talent

695
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,490
on the skateboarding
scene,

696
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:31,660
and we expect
the competition this
year to be fierce.

697
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:34,622
The winner will receive
$1,000 in prize money

698
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,081
and a trip to
the nationals

699
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:38,875
to compete against
the best boarders
in the nation.

700
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:50,011
Well, why don't
you go up
and sign in?

701
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:01,898
Go.

702
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,446
We just need
to get your

703
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:08,905
parent or guardian
to sign this form

704
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:09,947
if you want
to enter
the contest.

705
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:13,201
Uh, they're
not here.

706
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,328
Sorry, bud.

707
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,206
Is there a
problem?

708
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:19,500
Uh, are you
his father?

709
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:21,918
Uh, no.

710
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,840
Why don't you take
Jack and grab
us some seats?

711
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:42,690
Jack, these
guys are good.

712
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,941
This is a hard
competition.

713
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,445
Our next skater up
is Luke Gilbert.

714
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,700
<i>♪ These heads are rolling
they see black</i>

715
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,451
<i>♪ Watch them
smile the dust away</i>

716
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,496
Okay, you're in.

717
01:05:57,538 --> 01:06:00,541
I am? But they
said that I
wasn't allowed to.

718
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,710
I signed
the papers.

719
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,753
Oh, thanks, Ollie.

720
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:07,673
<i>♪ Take note and dot
the dot tonight ♪</i>

721
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,886
Okay, what
now, Skinner?

722
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,847
That monkey
is back.

723
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:16,932
He bit my player.
You know that.

724
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,727
I want him
off the ice.

725
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,062
What's going on
here, huh?

726
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,940
Look, coach.
Jack can hardly
skate now.

727
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,114
Aw, forget it.
You can have
your monkey.

728
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,785
We'll take the cup.

729
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,119
Look,
it's Jack!

730
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,747
Okay, then,
let's get this
game underway.

731
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:41,331
Thank you.

732
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:43,709
Next up,
Sammy Rogers.
Now, Sammy is

733
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:45,502
the only girl at this
year's competition,

734
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:47,796
and word has it she can
ride with the best of them.

735
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,009
Ollies over the
roll-in. Very cool.

736
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:00,392
Oh, she has some
awesome moves!

737
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,894
Stiff competition.

738
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:04,772
Oh, yeah. Girl power is
definitely alive and well

739
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,147
at this year's
competition.

740
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,691
Sammy's sending out
a message to the boys

741
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:09,484
that she means business.

742
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,028
Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

743
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:14,907
They started
already.

744
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:16,116
Oh, come on, let's
go. This way.

745
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,952
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Coming through.

746
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:19,995
Next up is
Neil Nellis.

747
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,997
Now, Neil is our defending
state champion,

748
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,457
and he's looking to
make it two in a row.

749
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,922
He starts with
a fakie hand and
a fakie rock.

750
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,385
Backside and
over the channel.

751
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,100
That boy likes to fly.

752
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,769
<i>♪ Hey, I know</i>

753
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:46,104
<i>♪ That I can't talk
to you right now ♪</i>

754
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:49,650
Ooh, and he falls on the
kick-flip over the channel.

755
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,859
Now there's
room for our

756
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,861
final skater to
make his move.

757
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:56,239
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.

758
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,825
Oh, it's a
good view.

759
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:00,076
We gotta see them
here for sure.

760
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,831
And our final
competitor for the day
will be Ben Johnson.

761
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:05,749
Me?

762
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,168
Yeah, that's you.

763
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:15,676
Okay.

764
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:26,269
You can do it!

765
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,484
Hey, Mike,
can I get some duct
tape over here?

766
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:00,136
Whenever you're
ready, Ben.

767
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,464
Jack, what are
you doing?

768
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:39,801
I can't do this.

769
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:43,138
Wait a minute.

770
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,390
There's somebody
else up there with him.

771
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:47,267
I think it's
a monkey.

772
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,103
Hey, look!

773
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:51,187
Dude,
it's a monkey!

774
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,488
<i>♪ Here we go</i>

775
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,204
That's the chimp
we've been
looking for!

776
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,585
That's the
boy, Ben!

777
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:16,755
<i>♪ It's good to finally be
back on the road again</i>

778
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:20,300
<i>♪ Where I see with both eyes</i>

779
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,804
<i>♪ When I lose my way I feel
my eyes close shut again</i>

780
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:28,349
<i>♪ And I'll yell to the sky</i>

781
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,019
These two are putting
on quite a double run.

782
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:34,230
This competition
has just gotten wild.

783
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:39,111
<i>♪ Better hold on tight</i>

784
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,114
Yes!

785
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,240
The chimp has
kicked out, and Ben's
ripping it on his own.

786
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:52,040
<i>♪ When I'm lost, you know
I feel my eyes go shut again</i>

787
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:55,418
<i>♪ And I'll yell to the sky</i>

788
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,171
<i>♪ If you want to

789
01:10:57,212 --> 01:10:59,214
<i>♪ Then you need

790
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,425
<i>♪ And you're wondering

791
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,678
<i>♪ Better hold on tight ♪</i>

792
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,013
All right!

793
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:12,393
What an amazing run
by Ben Johnson.

794
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:16,272
This crowd is going
crazy with excitement.

795
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:18,274
We did it, Jack.

796
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,361
That
was super slick.

797
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:25,615
We did it, Jack!

798
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:27,659
<i>We've got
less than 20 seconds left</i>

799
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:30,996
<i>in the second period,</i>
<i>and the game is all</i>
<i>tied one to one.</i>

800
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,706
<i>Here comes
Bubalochov in on Naddy.</i>

801
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,167
<i>Undresses Schikedanz.
The clock's winding down now.</i>

802
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:37,711
<i>He shoots, he scores!
Oh, what a beautiful goal!</i>

803
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,546
<i>Mad Dog Brady
never had a chance.</i>

804
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,298
<i>That ends
the second period</i>

805
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,718
<i>with the Carjackers
leading two to one.</i>

806
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,761
I just can't understand
why the Simians

807
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,930
<i>have not played</i>
<i>Jack at all in the</i>
<i>first two periods.</i>

808
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,432
You know, he
looked pretty rusty
during the warm-up.

809
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,601
Maybe he's got
to get his
ice legs back.

810
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,733
That's all right, Jack.
You'll get it back.

811
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:02,069
You're just a little
out of practice.

812
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,112
Yeah, you just
lost 40 pounds.

813
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,197
That's got to be
hard on the body.

814
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,447
Would you like
a hot dog?

815
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,574
Hot dogs are good for you.

816
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,784
They're full of
vitamins A, vitamin D,

817
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,537
vitamin C, vitamin E,
calcium...

818
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:14,414
And to announce
this year's winner,

819
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,334
please welcome
skateboarding champion
Bob Burnquist.

820
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,587
Thank you, Mandy.
Hello, everyone.

821
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,338
Wow, we saw
some great lines

822
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,965
from some awesome
skateboarders today.

823
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:26,301
Third place is gonna
go to Sammy Rogers.

824
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,802
All right,
Sammy.

825
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:32,307
Congratulations.
Thanks.

826
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,768
Second place
is gonna go
to Neil Nellis.

827
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,186
All right,
Neil.

828
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:38,604
Congrats.

829
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,649
Now, choosing
this year's winner

830
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,484
was a tough
decision but I
think our judges

831
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,362
did a great job,
and our winner is...

832
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:48,823
Ben Johnson.

833
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:53,369
Come on up,
Ben. Good job.

834
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,958
Good job.

835
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,252
Everyone,
let's give it up for
this year's winner,

836
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:01,628
Ben Johnson!

837
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:14,975
Ben! Ben!

838
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,560
Good job, buddy.

839
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,689
Ben! Ben!
No, no, no. Wait.

840
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,109
Ben, it's okay.
I just want to
talk to you.

841
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,735
I don't want
to go back.
But now, Ben

842
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,988
you know, I've
been thinking.

843
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,156
My place is
pretty empty

844
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,032
and I thought

845
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:36,412
you might perhaps
consider living with me.

846
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,709
Do you mean it?
You bet I do.

847
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,005
All right!

848
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:47,299
All right,
listen, folks,

849
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,676
I'm afraid I have
to take this
chimpanzee with me.

850
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,304
Jack didn't
do anything.
Oh, I know that.

851
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:53,680
He's got a hockey
game to play.

852
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,515
The Simians are
down two to one.

853
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,392
You mean you're not
gonna lock him up?

854
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,019
Lock him up?
Are you kidding?

855
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,104
Oh, this little
guy's no criminal.

856
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:03,190
Why, he's the
best thing to
happen to the ZHL

857
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:04,691
since the
Zamboni machine.

858
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:09,279
Well, I guess
you gotta go, Jack,

859
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:10,530
but we'll catch
up to you.

860
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,867
Yeah, Jack,
go on ahead.

861
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,451
You're not gonna
get rid of
us that easily.

862
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,835
Yo, Ben, good
job on the
ramp today, man.

863
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:25,170
Tell you what,

864
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:27,297
after seeing you
skate today, I want
to sponsor you.

865
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:28,882
Whoa!

866
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,717
Why don't you and
I go for a victory
session right now?

867
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,219
Right now?
Yeah, man, come on.

868
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,678
It's always
time to skate.

869
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:52,631
Whoa!

870
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,562
Come on.
Ready, Jack?

871
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,399
Come on, let's go.
Straight ahead.

872
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:10,942
There you
go. I'll see
you out there.

873
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:15,447
Jack?

874
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:16,823
Huh?

875
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,326
Huh?

876
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:20,952
Jack?

877
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,959
What?
Huh? What?

878
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:41,764
This explains it.

879
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:44,184
You're Jack?

880
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,393
And you're
Louie?

881
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:48,271
You're brothers.

882
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,398
Okay, men, we've got a
"chimpionship" to win.

883
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,650
Jack, put
your gear on.

884
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,402
All right, let's do it.

885
01:16:54,444 --> 01:16:56,321
Hey, great news.
We found Jack.

886
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:57,989
<i>Oh, and Louie's
here, too.</i>

887
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:00,283
Oh, great.

888
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:02,369
I'm gonna go
tell Lulu and
all the others.

889
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,661
<i>They're gonna
be thrilled.</i>

890
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,832
<i>All right, here</i>
<i>we go. The Simians</i>
<i>are back on the ice.</i>

891
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,126
Well, it's been
an incredible
game so far.

892
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:12,462
I'll tell you, LA
is leading two to one.

893
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:14,214
<i>If the Simians want</i>
<i>to have a</i>
<i>chance at the cup,</i>

894
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,423
<i>they've got
to score early.</i>

895
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,675
<i>That's right, Clark,
even with Jack back.</i>

896
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:19,469
<i>Fans are</i>
<i>on their feet</i>
<i>here in Seattle,</i>

897
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:20,845
<i>urging on their Simians.</i>

898
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:33,649
<i>Here's a
shot for the point.</i>

899
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,735
<i>Poirier passes the
puck down to the net.</i>

900
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,196
<i>Pass that puck to Jack.
Jack shoots, scores!</i>

901
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:40,739
Yeah!

902
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,659
<i>We got a
tie hockey game!</i>

903
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,330
Yes! Whoo!

904
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,004
Watch out!

905
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,512
Ahhh!

906
01:18:05,557 --> 01:18:08,768
<i>Bubalochov's</i>
<i>in on net. He</i>
<i>shoots and scores!</i>

907
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,478
<i>The Carjackers
take back the lead.</i>

908
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,705
Come on,
ref, I hardly
touched the guy.

909
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,586
Go for it,
fella, go!

910
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:37,713
Jack, I'm open.

911
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:39,674
Let's go, man.

912
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,804
Yeah!

913
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,431
Yeah!

914
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:03,197
Boy, what an exciting
game we got going
here tonight, Clark.

915
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,824
<i>With just over a</i>
<i>minute to go in</i>
<i>the third period,</i>

916
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,618
<i>the score is tied
three-three.</i>

917
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:07,743
<i>And I'll
tell you, folks,</i>

918
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,287
<i>Jack has really
pulled it together.</i>

919
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:12,373
<i>Bubalochov, a shot,
and it's saved by Brady.</i>

920
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:13,916
<i>That could have been
the game saver, Bruce.</i>

921
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:16,646
<i>Boy, you
could cut the tension</i>

922
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,962
<i>with a knife in
here, Clark.</i>

923
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,422
<i>Only 20 seconds
left on the clock.</i>

924
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:20,756
<i>We're tied up at three.</i>

925
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:23,926
<i>Looks like we'll
be going into overtime.</i>

926
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,221
Go, go, go, go.

927
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,734
<i>Ho, ho, what a move!</i>

928
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:46,491
Go, Jack!

929
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,412
Shoot!

930
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,248
Shoot!

931
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:58,670
Shoot, Jack!

932
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:05,176
Jack scored!

933
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:06,886
Yeah, Jack!

934
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,346
Yeah!

935
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,432
Yeah, it's good!

936
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,852
Yes!

937
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:16,479
Seattle has won the cup!

938
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:31,118
Ooh, I'm gonna get
that little monkey.

939
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:43,089
Not sorry.

940
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:59,188
Yeah! Ha, ha, ha!
All right, guys!

941
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,107
Well, there it is.
It's now official.

942
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,025
<i>Jack has been
named the MVP</i>

943
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,653
<i>for this year's
ZHL cup final.</i>

944
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,574
Yeah!

945
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,704
Jack! Jack! Jack!

946
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:27,007
Here, Louie.
I put this together

947
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,884
so you can
learn how to
skate like Jack.

948
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,522
Bye, Jack.
I'll miss you.

949
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,819
Goodbye, Jack.

950
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:46,986
Take care, Jack.

951
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,989
Rock on, Jack-o.

952
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,786
Jack and Louie,
don't forget friend.

953
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:11,051
Bye, Jack.

954
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,596
Come on, Ben.
Let's go home.

955
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,985
I'm gonna miss
them furry
little fellas.
