00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:33,414
[newscaster] One of the
worst serial killers

23
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,248
of the 21st century,

24
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,791
simply known to most
of us as The Mechanic,

25
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,208
will pay the ultimate
price for his crimes.

26
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,709
The state has set to
levy his final punishment

27
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,044
at 8:30 p.m. local time.

28
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,378
After serving 20
years on death row,

29
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:50,004
Randall Jackson will
be executed tonight,

30
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,630
giving final closure
to one of our nation's

31
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,464
most tragic moments.

32
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,382
The brutality of his crimes
will never be forgotten.

33
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,216
Twenty-six victims in all.

34
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,551
The only two victims
to survive his deadly

35
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,802
killing spree were
twins Abigail and

36
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:06,386
Madeleine Monroe, who
lost their parents

37
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,303
that fateful night at
the Cedar Creek murders.

38
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:11,721
Neither Abigail or Madeleine
were available for comment.

39
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:13,681
The only request
from Randall Jackson

40
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,223
was to face death
by electrocution.

41
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:18,933
When prison guards went
to his cell this morning

42
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,600
they found Mr. Jackson's
hands and fingers

43
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,726
scrapped down to the bone.

44
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,686
On the prison walls he scrolled
the same occult symbols

45
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,770
that were his
trademark calling card

46
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,396
of his crime scene 20 years ago.

47
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,730
Randall Jackson never
denied the killings.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,940
The state appointed
attorneys for the defendant

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,066
received multiple stays of
execution over the years

50
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,109
on the grounds of insanity.

51
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:45,026
A defense that Mr. Jackson
categorically denied.

okay? It's urgent.

79
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,755
[newscaster]Mr. Jackson
refused his final meal

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,381
and further refused to have a
pastor or a spiritual advisor

present at his execution.

82
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,633

[Maddie] It's the

It's the third or
fourth night in a row

141
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:55,814
this dream has happened.

142
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:57,814
[Tom] He's finally being
executed, you know.

143
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,022
This is gonna bring
about a lot of emotions,

stress and memories
for the both of you.

145
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:06,022
How does Abi seem
about his execution?

146
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,148
Maddie, you know I can't
talk about my other patients.

147
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:11,921
Please, she's my other half.

148

Um, she's distant.

- She doesn't wanna go to sleep.
- Yeah.

[Tom] Maddie, you and your
sister have been seeing me

152
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,106
about this trauma for years.

153
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,689
- This is not anything new.
- No, this is new.

154
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:28,981
This is different.

155
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,647
The dreams are-are more real,

156
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,314
more intense.

157
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,522
It's like I'm being
dragged to sleep

158
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,731
and no matter how hard I
try, I can't stay awake.

159
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,605
It's not like it's
lucid dreams either.

160
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,398
I can't control anything.

161
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:44,963
I'm just a prisoner
in this maze.

162
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,689
It's like ever since the date
of the execution was set...

163
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,981
I feel like these dreams
are leading to something.

164
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:55,273
I just don't know what.

165
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,064
I can prescribe you something.

166
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:59,231
- To stay awake?
- To sleep.

167
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,464
No. God, no. Are you crazy?

168
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,939
Sorry.

169
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:07,422
The idea of falling.
Asleep is terrifying

170
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,121
What about Abi's dreams?

171
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,022
Did she mention anything
about a tow yard?

172
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:18,398
I thought you two
weren't talking?

173
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:19,689
We're not.

174
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:21,546
But, Tom...

175
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,880
in this dream I'm her.

176
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:27,939
I'm Abi.

177
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:30,856
In the dream, her
hair, her awful clothes

178
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,522
and that terrible car of hers.

179
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:35,647
Um, could it be guilt?

180
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,772
Guilt that he grabbed
her and not you.

181
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:40,489
No, I don't think that.

182
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:43,231
W-what I think is weird, is
that the moment she disappeared

00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,398
I became her in my dreams.

W-what if, what if...

185
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,022
W-what if she's right?

186
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,814
What if it's more
than just dreams?

187
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,481
What could it possibly be?

188
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:56,106
- My sister thinks that...
- Maddie...

189
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,814
That-that he's still after us.

190
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:00,856
- Not this again.
- Yes. Yes, this again.

191
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,856
I'm surprised to be
hearing it from you.

192
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,689
[Maddie] Me too.
Trust me. Me too.

193
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm just not so
sure she's wrong.

194
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,605
How could he possibly
still be after you?

195
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,939
You know the crap he's
into. That occult shit.

197
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,440
And what would these spells do?

198

The hell do I know, Tom!

199
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:20,772
We're supposed to
go to Cedar Creek

200

to make our peace.

201
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:27,772
Have a moment, reconnect.

202
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,231
But I can't reach her though.

203
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,380
- Have you talked to her?
- Not since our last session.

204
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:36,647
This isn't just Abi
just ignoring me.

205
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:38,314
This is different.
Her phone's been off.

206
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:40,464
And Ethan's not
answering his either.

207

I'll-I'll call her.

If you hear from her,
will you let me know?

gonna find that they didn't?

00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:19,689
I'm gonna need for you to answer
a few questions for us first.

538
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:21,397
Not until I see her.

539
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,439
[woman on PA]Dr. Kravis,
you have a visitor

540
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,022
in the main lobby.

541
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:28,439
Dr. Kravis, a visitor
in the main lobby.

542
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:31,463
Abigail is caught on security
footage attacking three bikers.

543
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:33,940
[screaming]

544
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,397
She appears to have attacked
her husband as well.

545
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:39,856
It wasn't her.

546
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,898
Is there something
I should know?

547
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,522
No, it's just... My sister?

548
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:46,898
Three bikers, come on, how
does that sound to you?

549
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:49,606
Ms. Monroe, we
have the evidence.

550
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,981
Given the nature of the killings

551
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:53,522
and their relation
to Randall Jackson,

552
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:56,564
who's on the heels of
his impending execution,

553
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,981
we're having a
very difficult time

554
00:40:58,005 --> 00:41:00,522
understanding Abi's
motives here...

555
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:02,005
Copycat killings?

556
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:03,981
At the scene of the crime,

557
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,856
she left the same occult symbols

558
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,147
as The Mechanic
did 20 years ago.

559
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,898
They also match the symbols
he's been obsessively drawing

560
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:12,981
in his jail cell.

561
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:15,773
This must be very
difficult for you.

562
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:17,981
And you think she tried to
do this to her husband too?

563
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:21,272
At the moment she is the leading
suspect in that crime as well.

564
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,773
And of another roadside murder.

565
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:24,689
In all three cases, the
same occult symbols.

566
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,439
It wasn't her.

567
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:28,856
I know this isn't easy to
process, but the evidence is...

568
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,648
- Screw your evidence.
- Miss.

569
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:32,689
No! You don't understand.

570
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,731
You didn't watch your parents
get murdered before your eyes.

571
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:36,689
You didn't escape the
hands of a psycho.

572
00:41:36,713 --> 00:41:38,105
- I understand.
- No, you don't!

573
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,773
He-he grabbed her!

574
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,064
And he did something to her!

575
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:42,856
That-that night he
did something to her

576
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,147
and-and that's what all
this is! It's still him!

577
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:47,022
Please. Look, it...

578
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,356
I know this sounds crazy...

579
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,814
[Abi] It's not crazy! I see
him, I see him everywhere.

580
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:54,189
The dreams are so real.

581
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:55,689
I feel like I'm
never going to sleep.

582
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,314
I'm starting to
wonder what's real.

583
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:59,522
Goddamnit, Maddie!

584
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:02,022
He's doing some dark
arts, voodoo bullshit!

585
00:42:02,046 --> 00:42:03,731
What do you think those
things are that he draws?

586
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:04,898
That he's just
doing them for fun?

587
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,481
He's a sick man!

588
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:08,856
No shit. But they're not
just random scribbles.

589
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,064
There's a method to his madness.

590
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:13,898
Some satanic shit,
dealing with the occult.

591
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:15,689
Those symbols have meaning

592
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:18,648
and he's creating some kind
of eternity or afterlife.

593
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:21,856
The execution is
gonna set him free.

594
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,689
Wake up, Maddie.

595
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,981
It's only the beginning
of this nightmare for us.

596
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:28,689
Eternity? Abi...

597
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,463
How do you explain this?

598
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:33,272
What did you do to yourself?

599
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,439
You think I did this to myself?

600
00:42:35,463 --> 00:42:37,272
This was him!

601
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:39,773
Okay.

602
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:42,231
This is all been so
hard, for both of us.

603
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,981
The date of his
execution was just set.

604
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,773
When it happens let's
go to Cedar Creek,

605
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,856
make our peace, and
finally put this behind us.

606
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,814
You're not listening!

607
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,981
Abi, he's in prison.

608
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,648
He can't get to you.

609
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:58,922
Please stop this.

610
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:02,129
It's really hard. I know.

611
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:05,481
I'm sorry.

612
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:06,922
We got away.

613
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:10,272
He's not done with us.

614
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,088
He's never been done with us.

615
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,338
In your dreams, that's
where you can't escape him.

616
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,648
In your dreams, that's
where you can't escape him.

617
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:23,922
Excuse me?

618
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:28,838
Um, could I see my
brother-in-law, please?

619
00:43:30,213 --> 00:43:32,397
Of course.

620
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:34,439
He's one floor down.

621
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:36,088
Thank you.

You, you stay the
hell away from me.

629
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,731
I don't wanna hurt you.

630
00:44:21,755 --> 00:44:23,314
I don't care. Get back.

631
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:24,981
Oh, my God, Ethan, what
did my sister do to you?

632
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:26,356
Get back. Wait now.

633
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,147
This is exactly how
it happened with Abi.

634
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:29,588
- Get away. Stop!
- [Maddie] Ethan.

635
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:33,689
You have it too, don't
you? Show me your hand.

636

- No.
- Show me your...

637

- Open it up!
- No!

638

too, don't you?

639
