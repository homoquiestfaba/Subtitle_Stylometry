00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,077
Good morning, sir. Welcome to the Majestic.

2
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,307
May I help you?

3
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:50,225
Lionel Spalding...

4
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,384
and Neil.

5
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,701
Welcome to the Majestic, Mr. Spalding, Neil.

6
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,020
Thank you.

7
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,178

8
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,933
<i>(sings in German)</i>

9
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:11,803
This is the air shaft to basement.
Do you read me?

10
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,601
<i>I read you. What's your 20?</i>

11
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:17,797
I'm in position. Found our target.
He's pickingon poor Artie.

12
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:21,353
Artie, I don't care how long
you've been at this hotel.

13
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,710
You must smile when you greet the guests.

14
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:28,946
You should see this lady who checked in.
She weighs about a thousand pounds.

15
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:32,621
That's a physical impossibility.
And stay focused. We're on a mission.

16
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,659
Sorry. Ten-four.

17
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,131
One more time like this, and cut.

18
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:43,970
OK... go.

19
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,797
- Is he on the mark?
- Notyet.

20
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,430
- Kyle, what's he doing?
- Notyet!

21
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:08,184
<i>(woman sings on / dog growls and yaps)</i>

22
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,498
Now! Now! Now!

23
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:15,537
No...

24
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,093
Arh! Arh! Arh!

25
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,648
Argh!

26
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,594
Uh-oh. Air shaft to basement.
We have a problem.

27
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:39,033
- "What?"
- We hosed some guests.

28
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:41,669
Abort mission. Repeat, abort mission.

29
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:45,226
Neil! I'm comin', baby!

30
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,819
Neil!

31
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:57,533
- Better get out of here till things cool down.
- Gotcha.

32
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,050
Whoa!

33
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:06,125
Mr. Grant, you might wanna
step out here a moment.

34
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,160
- Hey, Murray.
- Hey, boys.

35
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,398
- "(Kyle) Slow down!"
- What the...

36
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,516
Wait a minute.

37
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:16,993
Brian! Kyle!

38
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,991
Better split up, Kyle.

39
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,509
What? Argh!

40
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:23,666
- Whoa!
- Aaaargh!

41
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,179
Getyour hands off me!

42
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:37,332
Well... isn't this a pleasant way
to start the day?

43
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:43,205
His name is Neil.

44
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:45,204
After Neil Armstrong.

45
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:48,880
"(baby talk)" The first man on the moon.
Yes, he was.

46
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:53,155
And he's very, very sensitive.

47
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,831
Yes, well, I can see that
just from lookinginto his eyes.

48
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:00,387
I just hope he hasn't suffered
any severe trauma.

49
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:01,707
Ahem.

50
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:04,343
- Mr. Grant.
- Yes. Thank you, Nancy.

51
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:06,781
Dr. Sultanov.

52
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,218
He's one of the finest
pet psychologists in the city.

53
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:14,373
Please mention my name,
and I'm sure he'll see Neil right away.

54
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:16,131
Well, thank you, Mr. Grant.

55
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,529
- Say thank you to Mr. Grant.
- "(yaps)"

56
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,006
Hmm.

57
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:24,363
We were aimingfor Norm, Dad.
He stole our Frisbee.

58
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,600
No. He did not steal your Frisbee.

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,036
He dugit out of the smoked salmon,
where you threw it.

60
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:32,275
We didn't mean to soak any guests.

61
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:33,833
Mm-hm.

62
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,187
Kyle, would you hold this?

63
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:43,063
Attaboy. Would you mind
puttingit in right about here?

64
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,261
- Dad.
- No, no. I insist.

65
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:48,258
Brian, you too.
Bernard, can I have another knife?

66
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:50,696
Push it in and start carving.
You might as well.

67
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:54,331
Because if this week doesn't go perfectly -
and I mean perfectly -

68
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,808
and if you two do "anything"
to foul up the Crystal Ball,

69
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:02,683
I am goingto be skewered, roasted,
and served as dead duck flambe.

70
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:08,237
So unless you two prefer moving
from a five-star hotel to a trailer park,

71
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:12,712
we will have no further disturbances.
Do you understand?

72
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:15,189
We're sorry, Dad.

73
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,065
Now...

74
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:22,702
next week...

75
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,140
after this is all over,

76
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,337
we get to go on vacation.

77
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:28,216
Yes!

78
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:32,092
Barbados for ten days, just the three of us.

79
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:33,091
Yes!

80
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,209
And we get to be the guests.

81
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,325
And we will nag, and we will complain,

82
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:41,482
and we will make
other people's lives miserable.

83
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,521
Yes!

84
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,039
But until that time...

85
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,717
you're both grounded.

86
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:48,994
- What?
- What?

87
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,547
Come on, guys. Let's go. Dinner.

88
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,142
Hey, I was up to 400 bucks.

89
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:03,180
- Where's your brother?
- Barbados.

90
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,214
Kyle, what are you doing?

91
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,530
Practicing.

92
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,047
I figure we need spear guns for sharks.

93
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,724
Wouldn't that be cool
if we got to shoot a shark?

94
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:22,001
- For everyone but the shark.
- Will the hotel have spear guns?

95
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,636
We can ask the concierge when we get there.
Don'tyou like your steak?

96
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,115
It's OK.

97
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:30,351
OK? That's the finest fillet in the city.

98
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:33,988
Well, maybe we should
cook for ourselves one night.

99
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:38,264
Why? We have a five-star restaurant
at our beck and call.

100
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,141
What if our plane crashes

101
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:45,377
and we're stranded in the jungle,
and we need spear guns to shoot our food,

102
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,694
but we don't know how to cook it?

103
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:50,570
You think the same way your mother did.

104
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:53,607
Did I ever tell you that before?

105
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:55,605
Is that good?

106
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:56,764
Well...

107
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,879
it was never boring.

108
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,435
<i>(speaking French)</i>

109
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:12,028
If you gotta be grounded,
a five-star hotel is the place to be.

110
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:25,534
So if you'd like extra towels or ice...

111
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:27,452
<i>(speaks French)</i>

112
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,768
Enjoy your stay.

113
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,843
<i>(small whimper)</i>

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,039

<i>(knock knock knock)</i>

116

<i>(knock)</i>

117
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,307
Terribly sorry. It slipped out of my hand.

118
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:53,985
I heard somethingin there.

119
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:59,379
Probably one of my sports coats.
I've been told they're a little bit loud.

120
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,616
Don'tyou think that's funny?

121
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh. Yeah, now I get it. "(chuckles)"

122
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,928
That's better.
Would you like to see a little trick, hm?

123
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,886
OK.

124
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:17,520
You know, I can do all sorts of tricks.

125
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,477
Do you know what my speciality is, hm?

126
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,875
No.

127
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,192
I can make nosy little boys disappear.

128
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,789
One more thing...

129
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:29,948
My dollar.

130
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:35,302
Good morning. Rutledge.

131
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:37,939
Welcome to the Majestic, Mr. Rutledge.

132
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,817
"Lord" Rutledge.

133
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:42,774
- I begyour pardon.
- Quite all right.

134
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:46,331
The Rutledges don't stand on the ceremony.

135
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,448
"(woman)" Lord Rutledge.

136
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,844
- What are you doinghere, darling?
- Mrs. Dellacroce. Are you here for the ball?

137
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:54,002
Of course.

138
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,599
Where is poor "Mr". Dellacroce?

139
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,038
Not here.

140
00:10:58,118 --> 00:11:00,156
Oh? How...

141
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,475
sad.

142
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,300
Let's get to work.

143
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:22,173
300 rooms, Dunston, equals 600 earrings,
if my math serves me right.

144
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:27,647
Here we are. The Majestic Hotel.

145
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,284
And it's ours for the taking.

146
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:35,320
And where better to begin
than with the lovely Mrs. Dellacroce?

147
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,838
Room 812.

148
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,756
Remember her?

149
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:43,191
I hope she hasn't pawned all the best jewelry
to finance those facelifts.

150
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,466
I thoughtyou'd given up.

151
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:53,218
It'll stuntyour growth. Now give it back.

152
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:59,531
Dunston, I'm a little too busy
for your ever-so-amusinglittle games.

153
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,889
Now will you please give it back?!

How delicious.

157
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,518
Very good.

158
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,556
Very good.

159
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:18,791
Dunston, have you seen the ice bucket?

160
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:23,626
I have two words to say to you:

161
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:26,503
medical... experiments.

162
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:29,860
Thank you.

163
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,377
Now... go to your room.

I'm a liberal parent.

Have ityour own way.

You look beautiful, don'tyou?

185
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:56,210
Mrs. Dubrow! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

186
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,887
- Shh. Quite all right.

187

191
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,714
Consuelo.

192
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:14,791

202

Mrs. Dubrow.

203
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:44,719
Ooh! Little roll in the carpet.
What a pleasant surprise.

204
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,156
- Mr. Dubrow, nice to see you, sir.
- Fluffy towels.

205
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,554
I begyour pardon?

206
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,112
Read the cards, Robert.

207
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:54,589
Got to keep up on the cards
so you know what our guests want.

208
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,666
Know what they want? Huh?
Know what they want?

209
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,664
- Fluffy towels?
- That's right.

210
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,621
Nice fluffy towels.
Talk to the laundry immediately.

211
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,138
Victor, darling, sit down
and work on your cards.

212
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:09,494
Robert, we have some very excitingnews.

213
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:14,848
- Uh...
- "(laughs)" Doesn't it look great?

214
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:19,443
- What do you think?
- Well, it's wonderful, Mrs. Dubrow.

215
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:23,479
But the "Le Monde" people might not
appreciate us just addinga sixth star.

216
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:29,793
No, no. The "Le Monde" people
have decided to award a sixth star

217
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,989
to the most elite hotels in the world.

218
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:38,783
Now, I have it on good authority
they have a person here "now".

219
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:42,420
The "Le Monde" people have
a representative here now? This week?

220
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,818
Of course. This week.

221
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,174
The Crystal Ball
is the social event of the season.

222
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,812
I want that sixth star.
Are we very clear on that?

223
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:51,970
I will be very upset if I don't get it.

224
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,088
I understand.

225
00:15:54,926 --> 00:16:00,361
Good. And next week, when every travel
section in the country interviews us,

226
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,158
I wantyou in the picture with me.

227
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,996
Next week...

228
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:08,032
Could you excuse me for just a second?

229
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:11,669
Uh, ah...

230
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:12,867
Oh, yes, yes.

231
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:16,823
I... I am scheduled for a vacation next week.

232
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:17,863
No, no, no, no!

233
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:19,980
Ow!

234
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,618
Uh... banged my knee. Trick knee.

235
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,775
Robert, I need you here.

236
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:26,774
Dad, you promised!

237
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:31,169
If you want to kill me, just kill me. Pick
somethingup and beat me over the head.

238
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:33,407
Why is he talkingto his crotch?

239
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,683
Is there a problem, Robert?

240
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:39,160
No. No.

241
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,319
Dad!

242
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,955
Uh, well, yes, um... actually, Mrs. Dubrow.

243
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,512
This is the second time I've had to cancel...

244
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,630
No, the third!

245
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,108
Word. What's the "word" I'm lookingfor?

246
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:52,826
I hate when that happens,

247
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,264
when words just fly out of your head.

248
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,661
It makes me insane when...

249
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,339
- Paper?
- Huh?

250
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,776
Robert, I know it's an inconvenience.

251
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,815
Uh, yes...

252
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,973
Let me just put it this way.

253
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:09,529
When we get the sixth star,
you are in for a bigbonus,

254
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:14,204
and you can take them
someplace fabulous... eventually.

255
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,480
But if we don't get the sixth star,

256
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:21,077
well... time off just won't
be a problem, will it?

257
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:24,353
Any other problems?

258
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,951
- No.
- Good. Oh, one more thing.

259
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,506
Since this is such an important time
for the hotel, you should fire somebody.

260
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,304
Yes... Mrs. Dubrow...

261
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:36,301
I haven't asked you to fire anybody since...

262
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,300
Christmas.

263
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,499
Yes.

264
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,657
Well, there's a clumsy clerk

265
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:43,454
with a foreign-soundingname.

266
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,492
- "Consuelo".
- She'll do.

267
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,530
Come along, Victor, darling!

268
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,688
Really, Mrs. Dubrow, I'm not sure...

269
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,645
Robert, now just do it!

270
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:55,640
By the way,
there's a small boy under your desk.

271
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:04,312
That's not fair, Dad! You promised us.

272
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:06,510
Let me work on it, Kyle.

273
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,346
I need to see Consuelo.

274
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,303
Oh, all right. Send her in.

275
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,382
You can't fire Consuelo.

276
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,300
I have a system, Kyle.

277
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:20,216
Fortunately, Mrs. Dubrow never remembers
who it is she wants me to fire.

278
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:22,173
Yes, Mr. Grant?

279
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:24,451
Consuelo, Consuelo...

280
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,648
I'm givingyou

a week's paid vacation, startingright now.

282
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:36,198
On one condition. You have to run
out of this office right now, crying.

283
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:38,916
OK.

284
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,656

He's a big, scary guy
with a huge trunk and lots of stickers.

288
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,952
Right. Scary guy. Huge trunk. Got it.

289
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,710

You bet, kid.

291
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:26,906
This one really liked me.
What do you think?

292
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,624
Mm... They're OK.

293
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:32,819
- I have a bad feelingabout this guy.
- Kyle, we're preoccupied here.

294
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,296
- I have a sense about these things, Murray.
- I know you do.

295
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:41,291
I just know he's up to no good.
So keep an eye out. He could be anywhere!

296
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:08,223
I've gotta go schmooze the guests.
Do whatyour brother says. Within reason.

297

Lord Rutledge. Tell me...

301
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:29,416
where do you keep the champagne?
Near the furnace?

302
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:33,092
Is there a problem, Lord Rutledge?

303
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:37,368
No. It's just thatyour room service
brought me a bottle of champagne

304
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:41,364
that I could have quite comfortably
bathed in - had there been any soap.

305

- Well, I'm terribly sorry.
- Yes. You should be.

00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,954
Neil!

353
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:57,110
And what are you waitingfor?

354
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:59,828
Uh...

355
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:01,786
A tip?

356
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:05,542
Kyle, I know you're upset about the vacation,

357
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,380
but that is really no excuse

358
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,616
to throw a guest's doginto the garbage!

359
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:12,375
I didn't throw him in the garbage.

360
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,692
Then what happened? No, don't tell me.

361
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:18,649
Let me guess. You gave him
a coffee-ground bath to improve his coat.

362
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:20,646
He jumped off the dogwalk!

363
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:23,643
The dogis suicidal?
Is that whatyou're tryingto say?

364
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:26,041
He smelled the monster on the ledge
and jumped.

365
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,117
Oh, he smelled the monster on the ledge.
It makes perfect sense now.

366
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:32,194
He smelled the monster on the ledge!

367
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:34,192
It was the smelly ledge monster!

368
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:35,951
Way to blow the tip, psycho.

369
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:46,260
Aargh!

370
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,375
Now listen, because I'm about to pass
sentence. You are both grounded!

371
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:53,292
- We're already grounded.
- You're double grounded!

372
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,811
And, Brian, no poker,

373
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,486
no videos, and no usingthe security room
for your own voyeuristic pleasures.

374
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,284
And, Kyle, no...

375
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,761
- "(phone rings)"
- No...

376
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,957
I'll get back to you on the punishment thing.

377
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,874
"Mr. Grant, sorry to disturb you".
"There's been a robbery".

378
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:13,311
All right. I'll be right down.

379
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:16,308
What about his punishment?

380
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:20,105
Think of somethingyou really like.

381
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:22,861
- You got it?
- Yeah.

382
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,940
No that!

383
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:42,561
Good evening, Lord Rutledge.
How was the play?

384
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,120
Delightful.

385
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,957
Haven't slept that well in months.

386
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:50,672
Now, show Daddy whatyou've got, hm?

387
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,866
<i>(titters)</i>

388
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:01,182
I am not amused.

389
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:07,176
I'm in no mood for this, Dunston.

390
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:13,010
Don't do this, Dunston.

391
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:16,606
You remember what happened
to your brother...

392
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:19,202
don'tyou?

393
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:23,439
Samson liked to play games, didn't he?

394
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:25,077
Hm?

395
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,114
And we all remember
what happened to Samson,

396
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:29,312
hm?

397
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,704
That? Do you want to tell me what is that,
for heaven's sake!

398
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:39,661
Oh, you blitheringidiot!

399
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:40,940
Arh!

400
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:48,613
Dunston, you're behavinglike a wild animal!

401
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,958
Dunston!

402
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:53,236
Dunston, come back here!

403
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:58,910
This job is not over.
The party is only just beginning!

404
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,267
Dunston, Daddy's sorry.

405
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:03,305

406
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:06,102
Dunston, I've got some lovely bananas here.

408
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,697
Don't wave your hairy bottom at me!

409
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:12,816
Dunston, remember, we're partners!

410
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:15,693
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line.

411
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,770
Come on, come back here!

412
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,088
Dunston!

413
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:21,567
Dunston!

414
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:46,141
Leave it on, please.

415
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,166
Good night, buddy.

416
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:06,720
Good night, Mom.

417
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,275
You still say good night to Mom?

418
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:13,073
Yeah.

419
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:16,350
That's not stupid or anything, is it?

420
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:19,067
No, Kyle.

421
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,264
It's not stupid at all.

422
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:27,418
8pm, Mrs. Dellacroce leaves for dinner.

423
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,096
Jewels are still there.

424
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:33,572
Three hours later, Mrs. Dellacroce returns.
The jewels are gone.

425
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:35,289
Duringthat time,

426
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,806
nobody else went through that door,
Mrs. Dubrow.

427
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:42,962
Who is that?

428
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,480
That's Lord Rutledge.

429
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:52,591
I wonder what he's doing.

430
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,988
That's very odd.

431
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:57,947
Dunston?

432
00:32:57,986 --> 00:32:59,584
Dunston!

433
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:03,661
Dunny...

434
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:10,093
The man from "Le Monde".

435
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:36,906
Brian, stop it.

436
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:38,743
Stop it.

437
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:40,822
Brian...

438
00:33:58,364 --> 00:33:59,522
Dad!

439
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,960
There's a gorilla in the bathroom!

440
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,916
Kyle, there is no gorilla
in the bathroom.

441
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,954
- But, Dad...
- Go back to sleep.

442
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:09,991
I can't sleep now!

443
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:12,429
Then watch TV.

444
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,066
Nice little black-and-white movie.

445
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:16,784
You'll be out in no time.

446
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:19,821

Kyle, go to sleep.

450
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:32,506
All right. All right. You can sleep with me
tonight if you're still scared. But just tonight.

451
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:42,695
"(coughs)" Did you brush your teeth?

452
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:48,488
What are you... You wearingyour flannels?

454
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:14,222
Well, you slept all over the place.

455
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:16,500
The bathroom!

456
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,457
Guess he really has to go.

457
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:24,451
The camcorder!

458
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,805
No!

459
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:38,295
Dad's gonna kill you when he finds out
you lost his camcorder.

460
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:42,290
- I didn't lose it. The gorilla did.
- Oh, right. The gorilla.

461
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,447
Wait till we get it back - you'll see.

Oh, boy.

there's a box of magazines under my bed.

00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:16,056
Get rid of them, OK?

470
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:17,653
Gotcha.

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,875
<i>Lucy and Jules, lookin'good, girls
So all aboard, let the party begin</i>

534
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:45,593
<i>I'm on the mike, I make you dance,
I make you funk, I make you sweat</i>

535
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:47,790
<i>Bombin' out till the break of dawn</i>

536
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,148
<i>So get up the bar, let's have a ball</i>

537
00:42:50,228 --> 00:42:52,385
<i>Rummin' out till the morning comes</i>

538
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:55,143
-"And I said"...
-"Have fun, go mad"

539
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:56,860
-"Do what I say"
-"Have fun, go mad"

540
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,057
-"Doo doo party"-"do"
-"Have fun, go mad"

541
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:02,895
-"Come on"
-"Have fun livin' in the city"

542
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:04,972
"Here we go"...

543
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,809
"(whispers)" Dunston.

544
00:43:08,328 --> 00:43:09,447
Dunston.

545
00:43:09,528 --> 00:43:12,085
"(Mrs Dellacroce)" Ohh...

546
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:16,241
So far it's been a ghastly trip.

547
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,238
Except for one thing...

548
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:22,554
Mr. Dellacroce didn't come with me.

549
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:28,588
"(masseur chuckles)" I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get that... special oil.

550
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:30,146
Don't be long.

551
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:41,055
Oh!

552
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:45,570
I didn't hear you come in.

553
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,648
Oh, that's just how I like it.

554
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,646
- "(cackles)"
- Yes...

555
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:53,202
Oh, William!

556
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:55,480
You are amazing!

557
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:57,838
Hoo-hoo!

558
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,635
Oh!

559
00:44:00,714 --> 00:44:01,873
William!

560
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:07,108
Oh, you are astounding! I don't know
whatyou're doing, but it's fabulous!

561
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:10,664
William... Oh!

562
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:13,061
Ooh!

563
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:15,339
Ouch! Oh!

564
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:19,095
Ouch! "(chuckles)"

565
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:22,172
Oh! More! More, William, more!

566
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:24,249
<i>(chortles)</i>

567
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,128
Oh, William!

568
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,005
Don't stop, William.

569
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,763
William?

570
00:44:30,843 --> 00:44:33,280
William... "(laughs)"

571
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,638
Oh, William!

572
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,501
<i>(blows raspberry)</i>

573
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,937
Dunston! Come on,
we got to get out of here fast!

574
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,962
OK. You stay here and be very quiet.

575
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,079
My dad's gonna help us.

576
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,678
Don't worry, Dunston.

577
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:16,875
I'll be right back.

578
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:33,817
Mmm. Is that a loofah?

579
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,376
That feels great, Helene.

580
00:45:36,694 --> 00:45:40,331
Mmm. That's interestingperfume.
Is that... musk?

581
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,670
Helene, what are you...

582
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:02,427
Arh! Pervert!

583
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:13,936
Ouch.

584
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:17,093
- But, Dad, Kyle tried to kill me!
- "(cell phone rings)"

585
00:46:17,132 --> 00:46:22,287
You should put him in some special school.
They'll take care of him, cook for him...

586
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:25,124
- He can come home on holidays.
- What?!

587
00:46:25,204 --> 00:46:27,682
What is your brother doingin the spa?

588
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,158
Dad!

589
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,636
It wasn't a monster.
It's a monkey, and his name is Dunston!

590
00:46:33,715 --> 00:46:36,272
This guy wants to hurt him.
He's hidingin the spa!

591
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:37,951
He's right in here!

592
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,749
What's goingon here?

593
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:41,268
Where is he?

594
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:44,144
- Terribly sorry, ladies.
- But, Dad, he was here...

595
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:45,662
What is wrongwith you?

596
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:49,579
Kyle, how many times have I told you
not to come down here?

597
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:52,855
- What language do you speak?!
- It's him! It's the guy!

598
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,053
Told you, Dad. Crazy.

599
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:57,211
Brian!

600
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,167
That's him! That's the guy!

601
00:47:00,248 --> 00:47:04,363
This is him, Dad. He's got a monkey
named Dunston, and he tried to hurt him.

602
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:06,841
You're in trouble now!

603
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,638
My dad's here!

604
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:11,436
Well...

605
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:12,915
Lord Rutledge, I am...

606
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:15,352
terribly, terribly sorry.

607
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:18,229
It's no wonder this hotel is so shoddily run.

608
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:21,865
You can't even control one small boy,
can you?

609
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,823
Well...

610
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,899
He's very, very sorry. Aren'tyou, Kyle?

611
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,659
No!

612
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:30,097
He tried to hurt Dunston!

613
00:47:30,176 --> 00:47:33,253
Your son, sir, is behavinglike a lunatic.

614
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,410
- No, I'm not!
- Enough!

615
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,247
Apologize to Lord Rutledge.

616
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:42,164
- But, Dad...
- Now.

617
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,758
I'm sorry.

618
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,196
Now get upstairs.

619
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:53,432
And stay there.

620
00:47:57,148 --> 00:47:58,547
Ah... uh...

621
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:01,703
Lord Rutledge, uh, I would, um,

622
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:05,740
very much like you to be my guest
at dinner this evening.

623
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,377
Oh, how thrilling.

624
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:13,212
Well, excellent.
I'm sure you will enjoy the cuisine here.

625
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:16,568
I doubt that the city
offers any diningexperience...

626
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:50,417
Ah. Ladies.

627
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:54,133
Please forgive me
for beingquite so detained.

628
00:48:54,213 --> 00:48:55,972
Mrs. Feldman, Mrs. Winthrop.

629
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:58,568
Mrs. Winthrop, Mrs. Feldman.

630
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:01,525
Yes. Yes, of course. Obviously.

631
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:07,040
Well, first of all, let me say how grateful
we all are for the wonderful work

632
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,637
thatyour organization has been doing

633
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,915
in its fight against, uh...

634
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,109
tinea versicola.

635
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:22,104
It's a skin disease.
Not deadly, just... unsightly.

636
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:24,941
All the good diseases were taken.

637
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,978
Yes. Yes, they were.

638
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:40,167
Now, I know thatyour organization
has been to the Four Seasons.

639
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:44,123
Of course I would be loath
to ever speak ill of a competitor, but...

640
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:45,641
Holy shit!

641
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,237
He must really hate the Four Seasons.

642
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:51,155
No! No! No!

643
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:55,191
I'm sorry. I just wasn't prepared
to speak about monkeys... money!

644
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:58,188
Would you excuse me? I'll be right back.

645
00:49:58,268 --> 00:50:00,226
I will be... right back.

646
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:04,421
They put the doorknob in the middle...
Ha-ha... Oh, gosh...

647
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,975
Get Security up here A.S.A.P. Then call
the best animal control person in the city.

648
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:15,650
Nancy, Nancy... Call Kyle,
and, uh, apologize for me.

649
00:50:18,287 --> 00:50:21,125
I got a monkey in my hotel.

650
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:25,879
Monkey?

651
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,956
"(singsong)" Oh... monkey!

652
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:33,991
I wonder where he is.

653
00:50:37,866 --> 00:50:39,505
Yoo-hoo!

654
00:50:39,585 --> 00:50:40,944
Here, here...

655
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,983
Arh!

656
00:50:43,022 --> 00:50:46,179
- Mr. Grant seems very competent.
- Yes.

657
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:49,215
Until he ran screaming
from the room, of course.

658
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,453
Of course.

659
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:52,292
Argh!

660
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,966
Argh!

661
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,282
<i>(horn blast)</i>

662
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:19,943
Ahem.

663
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,378
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

664
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:30,132
Mm-hm.

665
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,050
Okey-doke.

666
00:51:41,321 --> 00:51:45,956
All these monkeys... are criminals?

667
00:51:47,634 --> 00:51:49,312
Well...

668
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:51,830
that kind of looks like him.

669
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:54,547
"Pongo pygmaeus".

670
00:51:54,627 --> 00:51:58,543
You've got an orangutan problem, Mr. Grant.

671
00:51:58,623 --> 00:52:00,981
Where did he come from?

672
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,216
Well, ma'am,
when two orangutans fall in love...

673
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:08,453
I think she means
how did he get in the hotel?

674
00:52:08,532 --> 00:52:10,051
Oh.

675
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:12,529
My guess...

676
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:14,286
the sewers.

677
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:15,965
I begyour pardon?

678
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:18,362
Hypothetical situation.

679
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:22,079
It's Easter.

680
00:52:22,158 --> 00:52:27,313
You think it might be cute
to put a baby orangutan in your kid's basket.

681
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:29,391
Well, at first it is cute.

682
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:31,309
Then it gets bigger.

683
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,947
The kids lose interest.

684
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:35,584
And then one night...

685
00:52:35,665 --> 00:52:38,061
you flush it down the toilet.

686
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:41,698
That's ridiculous!

687
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:44,775
You ever been in the sewers of this city,
Mr. Grant?

688
00:52:44,855 --> 00:52:46,173
Well, I have!

689
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:49,210
I could tell you stories...

690
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:54,045
I saw a turtle one time...

691
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:58,081
looked like a Volkswagen with a tail.

692
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,998
It was 1967.

693
00:53:01,038 --> 00:53:02,875
Summer of Love.

694
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:09,109
I haven't felt comfortable
sittingon the john since.

695
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:12,785
Since... 1967?

696
00:53:14,064 --> 00:53:17,022
Now, if he's contained...

697
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,979
it should be easy.

698
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:20,338
Dad!

699
00:53:20,378 --> 00:53:21,617
No!

700
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,014
- Dad, what's goingon?
- Not now, son.

701
00:53:24,054 --> 00:53:26,371
Excuse... Arh!

702
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:29,129
Dad, why does he have a gun?

703
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:30,927
I'll tell you later.

704
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,125
Hey...

705
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:35,962
Sorry I didn't believe you.

706
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:37,361
Now take off, OK?

707
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:43,154
This tranquilizer dart'll
knock a human out for 18 hours.

708
00:53:43,194 --> 00:53:45,432
And its effect on an orangutan?

709
00:53:45,512 --> 00:53:48,229
Kill him, most likely.

710
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:56,580
I don't want anyone to say
that this monkey made a monkey out of us.

711
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,176
Don't move unless I say so.
If you see the monkey, yell out loudly.

712

- "You" stay right here...
- Murray! Murray, quick!

713
00:54:03,853 --> 00:54:08,808
He got out! He's in the kitchen!
You better get there fast. Dad's pretty mad!

714
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:12,883
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Move. Move!

- No. I did not.

We're dealingwith a very smart animal here.

735

- He's a psycho.
- But I "like" obsessive people.

He's still here!

Dunston, do you hear? It's me.

741
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:43,687
Dunston.

742

743

He's absolutely incredible.

00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,256
- He's scared.
- Well, do what Dad does.

00:57:15,173 --> 00:57:16,212
OK.

Happy birthday to you

Dunston, I know it hurts,
but it's for your own good.

758
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:41,386
It's like when you get a shot, or broccoli.

759
00:57:41,427 --> 00:57:43,984
It's better if you don't look at it.

760
00:57:44,063 --> 00:57:45,861
Look at me, Dunston.

761
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:47,700
Look at me.

762

We got it, Dunston.

765

Isn't he cool?

766
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,086
Sure, he's cool, Kyle,
but what are we gonna do with him?

767
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,725
He can stay in my room.

768
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:04,762
Come on. Dad might be a little preoccupied,

769
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:08,358
but I think he'll notice
an orangutan in your room.

770

Wait a minute. We have lots of rooms.

Dr. Lam Binh Ngoc.

00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:31,854
Hotel thinks you're a doctor,
you can get away with anything.

778
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:43,042
Let's go, Dr. Ngoc.

779

How do you like it, Dunston?

783
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,218
Uh-oh.

784
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:07,976

You've ruined my retirement fund.

Treacherous little hairball.

789
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:47,855
Lord Rutledge.

790
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:49,374
How was your meal?

791
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:51,850
Well, from the look of the soup,

792
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:56,366
my guess is that someone in your kitchen
has a serious hair-loss problem.

793
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:59,363
Other than that, it was absolutely delightful.

794
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:00,722
Good night.

795
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:09,233
Well? How was his meal?

796
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,069
I believe he used the words
"absolutely delightful."

797
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:17,583
I hope so. You know, especially after
that little incident with your son today.

798
01:00:17,664 --> 01:00:20,061
Oh, Mrs. Dubrow, that was totally...

799
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:22,778
Robert, I like children. I really do.

800
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:25,656
But let me just ask you this.

801
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:30,050
Do you think there's a way we can keep
your boys locked in their rooms?

802
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:32,568
You know, just till the Crystal Ball is over?

803
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:34,885
We could make a game out of it.

804
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,884
We could call it "quarantine."

805
01:00:37,003 --> 01:00:42,039
Mrs. Dubrow, I can assure you
that there will be no further incidents.

806
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:46,474
As of this moment,
they are both on their best behavior.

807
01:00:51,268 --> 01:00:53,746
Whoo! Yeah! What a catch!

808
01:00:57,382 --> 01:00:59,900
Incoming! Whoo-hoo!

809
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:04,375
I'd like to order two banana splits,

810
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:08,171
extra bananas on each, and a Caesar salad
with extra bananas as well.

811
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:11,168
Roll! Roll! Roll! Roll! Roll! Roll!

812

01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:50,448
Well, Dunston,
Frisbee may not be your game.

823
01:01:51,247 --> 01:01:52,645
Don't worry.

824
01:01:52,724 --> 01:01:55,641
That Rutledge guy will never find you here.

825
01:01:55,722 --> 01:01:58,199
Come on, Kyle. We'd better go.

826
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:00,037

- For what?

Hey, what the hell? I'm grounded.
I gotta do something.

831

Boy, if Dad ever finds out that we checked
Dunston into the hotel, we'd be in bigtrouble.

01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:22,574
Well, I wouldn't worry about that
if I were you.

833

Dad's gonna have his hands full.

- How are the mints?
- I begyour pardon?

- Bloody thing!
- We need new mints.

Yes. And he'll hurt Dunston if he finds him.

I think everyone should know how they
bludgeoned and tortured the poor animals.

That is why I always carry pictures
of the process.

That is how they do it
to poor little bunny rabbits.

Oh, this is horrifying.

949
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:24,379
Why can't we treat all creatures
with kindness and respect?

01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:26,184
Sounds pretty good to me.

1067
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,118
Hello, Dunston.

1068
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,876
Nice to officially meetyou.

1069
01:19:58,032 --> 01:19:59,230
Dad, can we?

1070
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:01,787
No, we can't.

1071
01:20:01,868 --> 01:20:05,503
- We can't.
- Please? He can stay in my room.

1072
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:07,462
I'll take good care of him.

1073
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:10,419
Kyle, listen to me.

1074
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,813
Dunston can stay with us tonight,

1075
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:18,849
but tomorrow we've got to find
another place for him.

1076
01:20:21,527 --> 01:20:23,645
<i>(whimpers)</i>

1077
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,398
It's a really nice zoo.

1078
01:20:30,478 --> 01:20:33,035
No one will be mean to you or anything.

1079
01:20:33,794 --> 01:20:36,072
And you'll have friends.

1080
01:20:38,749 --> 01:20:41,466
No. Monkey friends.

1081
01:20:43,065 --> 01:20:48,259
I'm not sure where I'll be, but I'll try
to come and visityou whenever I can.

1082
01:20:48,339 --> 01:20:50,457
<i>(knock on door)</i>

1083
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:52,015
It's them.

1084
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:56,131
Mr. Dubrow?

1085
01:20:56,211 --> 01:20:57,409
Morning, Kyle.

1086
01:20:57,489 --> 01:20:59,168
Where's Mrs. Dubrow?

1087
01:20:59,248 --> 01:21:02,005
Scoutinghotel sites in Alaska.

1088
01:21:02,085 --> 01:21:04,402
We've come to see your father.

1089
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,121
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

1090
01:21:06,201 --> 01:21:08,198
I wantyou to stay.

1091
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,875
This is the finest hotel in the entire chain.

1092
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:12,354
Yes, it is.

1093
01:21:12,394 --> 01:21:16,709
This is everythingl've ever dreamed of doing.
And now I've done it.

1094
01:21:16,749 --> 01:21:18,947
I think I'd like a position...

1095
01:21:21,424 --> 01:21:24,022
that's a little less demandingon my time.

1096
01:21:27,898 --> 01:21:30,136
Let me see what I can do.

1097
01:21:30,215 --> 01:21:33,852
Mr. Dubrow, you know lots of people, right?

1098
01:21:33,891 --> 01:21:35,250
Why do you ask?

1099
01:21:35,331 --> 01:21:39,926
I have this friend
who's sort of in need of a favor.

1100
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:03,821
Lionel Spalding...

1101
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,100
and Neil.

1102
01:22:05,179 --> 01:22:09,455
Welcome to the Bali Majestic, Mr. Spalding.
The manager has been expectingyou.

1103
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:14,050
Mr. Spalding, I can't tell you how pleased
I am thatyou accepted our invitation.

1104
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:18,246
Particularly after those rather unfortunate
circumstances back in New York.

1105
01:22:18,326 --> 01:22:21,961
But, as you can see,
we are far, far away from there right now.

1106
01:22:22,042 --> 01:22:27,756
And my family and I are dedicated
to makingyour stay here at the Bali Majestic

1107
01:22:27,835 --> 01:22:31,312
as uneventful and trouble-free
as is humanly possible.

1108
01:22:31,391 --> 01:22:33,669
Your room and meals are complimentary,

1109
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:37,786
and if you'd like me to arrange a line of credit
in the casino, I'd be happy to.

1110
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:41,741
You may hear some of our native islanders
out and around the bushes.

1111
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:48,294
There's nothingto worry about. I guarantee
there will be no further incidents to deal with.

1112
01:22:48,374 --> 01:22:51,531
- Uh, Dad...
- If you need anything, pick up the phone...

1113
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:53,408
- Dad...
- Just a moment, Kyle.

1114
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:57,245
One of the things I want to tell you about
is the Bali Hai buffet,

1115
01:22:57,325 --> 01:23:00,922
which we offer every day
at breakfast and lunch.

1116
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,798
No!
