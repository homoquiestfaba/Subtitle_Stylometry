1
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:25,173
Now, do you remember
where you're hiding him?

2
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,115
All I want to do
is help him.

3
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:38,263
My brother will never
be one of you.

4
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,666
Is it worth it to die
for the secret?

5
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,275
Listen,
we could save you.

6
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,904
You can be
a normal human again.

7
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,575
This woman, she is a doctor.
She can help you.

8
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,709
We're not far from
discovering an antidote.

9
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,310
Tom, he doesn't
care about that.

10
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,354
Yes I do.

11
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,946
You could be
healthy again.

12
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,684
You can all
be healthy again.

13
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,191
An antidote?

14
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,955
Yeah.

15
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,461
For what?
For this?

16
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,496
Is that what
the bitch told you?

17
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,270
Carrie, are you still doing
your old doctor trick?

18
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:28,007
Do you still wear your
white smock like before?

19
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,785
You don't really believe
she's a doctor, do you?

20
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,047
She pretends
to be a doctor

21
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,089
so she can get close
to the family members.

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,784
That's what she does.

23
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,349
She's vampire hunter.

24
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,292
There is no antidote,

25
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,627
and there sure as hell is
no cure for your brother.

26
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,393
Tom, it's not like that.

27
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,660
What is so different
this time?

28
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,263
Everything she
promised you is a lie.

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,274
She wants to kill
your brother, not me.

30
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,502
Fuck you.

31
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,874
She tricked you
and she used you.

32
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,007
I hope for your sake

33
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,778
you haven't gotten
too close to her.

34
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,845
She's very good
at getting people

35
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,686
to fall in love
with her.

36
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,694
I have to find him,
do you understand?

37
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,939
I have to find him and
you are going to tell me.

38
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,547
I don't know
where he is.

39
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,591
I know.

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,987
I know where his
brother's hiding.

41
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,155
Where is it?

42
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,361
Get Pashek first.

43
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,563
Why don't you tell me?

44
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,971
Because you're not
in charge here.

45
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,305
I will only talk
to your master.

46
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,709
I need his word
he'll let us go.

47
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,644
Carrie, have them put us
in a car first...

48
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,649
Tom, please.

49
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,721
So, you want his brother.

50
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,249
You want him so bad,
we're still alive.

51
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:26,162
What's so special
about his brother? What?

52
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,929
But I want something
from Pashek in return.

53
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,732
If you tell me,
I'll let you go.

54
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,204
You have my word.

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,037
Fuck that.

56
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,207
How's your hand?

57
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,010
Rotting yet?

58
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,812
You know it'll eat its way
through your whole body.

59
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,945
I'll watch you eat
your own entrails!

60
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,155
First...

61
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,191
why don't you give
that to your master?

62
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,201
Tell him this time
he can't escape the Devil.

63
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,402
So you want me
to come with you?

64
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:24,351
And you want me
to give her my word.

65
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,392
A human?

66
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,664
Your fucking idea to bring her
here in the first place!

67
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,499
We need the man.
The woman's useless. Kill her.

68
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,435
Should we really kill her?

69
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,838
We are all going to die
because of you.

70
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,809
No, we're safe here.

71
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,345
Oh, really?
In this shithole?

72
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,384
Has your rotting arm caused
you to go blind as well?

73
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,219
You will never find him.

74
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,920
We need to be
on that ship now!

75
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,689
We need to evacuate!

76
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,858
I thought I could trust
my life with you,

77
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,459
- you of all people.
- It'll heal!

78
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,060
But he will find me!

79
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,106
- I won't allow that.
- Oh, really?

80
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,936
Will you shoot him?

81
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,729
He wants me to know
he's here.

82
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,293
He's mocking me.

83
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,271
He can't find us here.

84
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,365
Don't you understand?

85
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,242
It's him, Vlad Kossei,

86
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,179
the Devil himself!

87
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,153
Be not afraid of him.

88
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,716
I defeated him once before
and now I have his brother.

89
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,226
I'll find him.

90
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,097
Bring me the bitch.

91
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,314
Do you remember me?

92
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,482
Too bad I wasn't fast enough
to get you back then.

93
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:51,099
Too bad I can't cut you
right now.

94
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,675
Oops!
Aw.

95
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,985
I might as well get used
to the way you taste.

96
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,743
No! Don't!

97
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,856
Get her!

98
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,271
Shit!

99
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,532
Shit!

100
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,280
You okay?

101
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,307
Of course I'm not.

102
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,689
Who are you really?

103
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,034
I don't have much time.

104
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,370
Thank you for sharing
some of it with me.

105
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,171
This is Paul Cramer,
my lawyer.

106
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,303
Please, what is this about?

107
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,440
I'm Dr. Carrie Rieger
from the Riverdale Institute.

108
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,074
I'm sure you've never
heard of us.

109
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,346
We're specialized in
psychosomatic illnesses

110
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,012
with extreme inclinations.

111
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,085
Your brother
Christopher Clayton

112
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,823
was being treated
at Livermore Hospital.

113
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,296
He disappeared from
there five days ago.

114
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,266
You didn't say this was
about his brother!

115
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,302
We're treating him
at home now.

116
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,859
Tom, don't say anything.

117
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,462
The Riverdale Institute
is uniquely equipped

118
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,804
to deal with the disease pattern
your brother's exhibiting.

119
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,972
Miss Rieger, I must insist
that you leave immediately.

120
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,641
- Has his jaw transformed yet?
- Hey hey hey!

121
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,809
- Everything's all right, Tom.
- This is just the beginning.

122
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,046
Thank you for your visit.
Send your materials.

123
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,486
Mr. Clayton is very well-known
for his generosity

124
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,820
to charitable institutions.

125
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,757
As soon as his teeth start to
change, stay away from him.

126
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,854
We don't need
any more publicity.

127
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,832
"You're in danger.
Don't trust anyone."

128
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:50,308
Believe me, we're doing
exactly the right thing.

129
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,261
Is that it?
No wallet?

130
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,492
What do you mean,
"Is that it"?

131
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,966
Fuckin' lucky to be alive.

132
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,171
So it was two vampires.

133
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,434
The watch and the necklace
were from the big one,

134
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,100
the rest is
from the other one.

135
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,147
That was a rating 2.

136
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,615
And what's this?

137
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,618
They had those
around their necks.

138
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,784
Since when do vampires
carry stakes around?

139
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,828
Maybe they're trying
to help us out.

140
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,056
You also had a ring?

141
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,432
If you don't mind,
in the future make a list

142
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,205
of what you got
off of which vampire.

143
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,711
That goes for all of you.

144
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,112
Next time we'll be sure
and write their names down.

145
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,173
It's not about the names.
It's about transparency.

146
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,947
- Do you think we're stealing?
- Why don't you just listen?

147
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,988
Come on, answer me, Sid.

148
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,354
Hey hey hey, enough talk.

149
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,189
Everyone follows the rules.
Okay?

150
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,363
That includes
you and me both.

151
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,264
Now sit down, Grant,
sit down.

152
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,400
We're vampire hunters,
not fucking accountants.

153
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,099
Yeah, but we still
have to pay our bills.

154
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,734
Speaking of money,
we need new motion sensors

155
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,038
for the house perimeter.

156
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,635
And I need a new crossbow.

157
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,736
Forget it.

158
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,441
What's wrong with
the motion sensors now?

159
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,177
Three of them crapped out
from the rain.

160
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,811
I don't know which is worse,
the vampires or the bank.

161
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,151
We just need richer vampires.

162
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,418
- Right on.
- So, what are we, muggers now?

163
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,289
Of course not.
It's like the vampires

164
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,794
have to make a donation
to the cause.

165
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,127
Because they don't
do so voluntarily,

166
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,690
we have to extract it
from them.

167
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,032
We used to want
to fight evil, didn't we?

168
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,128
Now it seems like
all we care about is money.

169
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,901
It's always been like that.

170
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,999
As far as I'm concerned,
they're vampires...

171
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,601
scum... and they don't have
a fucking claim to anything.

172
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,146
That's why we take
what we can get.

173
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,512
So what are we on today?

174
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,245
I went to see that
Thomas Clayton guy...

175
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,879
you know, the rich dude.

176
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,516
Yeah, but we don't really know
he's a vampire, remember?

177
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,026
He showed the typical symptoms
of the transformation.

178
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,358
Very weak symptoms.

179
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,921
In any case, he has disappeared
without a trace

180
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,398
and I think his brother's
hiding him.

181
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,526
If all the vampires
bit him on his trip

182
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,332
he'd have mutated long ago.

183
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,201
Not necessarily.

184
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,571
I've seen it take
several weeks.

185
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,109
He's cute.

186
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,535
And rich.

187
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,978
I think this guy
knows exactly

188
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,607
that his brother's
a ticking time bomb.

189
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,173
I ain't gonna wait until
he bites them.

190
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,447
They always wait
too long.

191
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,750
- He looks sad.
- He called me.

192
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,621
Ah, the old
"don't- trust-anyone" trick.

193
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,683
He wants to meet
with me...

194
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,558
without his lawyer.

195
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,122
Excellent! You find out
where his brother is, got it?

196
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
We'll do the rest.

197
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,103
I don't want anymore
solo performances.

198
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,698
Don't screw up. We could
really use a rich vampire.

199
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,688
Chris?

200
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,654
Maybe you
should wait here.

201
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,199
Chris?

202
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,443
Where is he?

203
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,809
Gone.

204
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,757
- Your brother lives here?
- Yeah.

205
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,264
I keep telling him, but he
never opens the window.

206
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,201
How long has he
been like this?

207
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,261
Since he got back.

208
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,213
Oh my God.

209
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,030
No.
Don't touch him.

210
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,898
Oh, shit.
That's Paul, my lawyer.

211
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,959
Not anymore.

212
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,069
Where the hell
is my brother?

213
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,110
He took him.

214
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,042
Who?

215
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,647
The one who did that.

216
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,410
I just wanted
to look at it.

217
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,950
I risk my life
every fucking day.

218
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,713
Put it back.

219
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,290
Lately I've been thinking about
whether this is all worth it.

220
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,380
Looking like that,
I think I'd even tell you

221
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,980
where my brother
was hiding...

222
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,753
if I had one.

223
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,658
We're gonna take
Grant's cousin with us

224
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,561
so he can learn the
virtues of being a hunter...

225
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,098
waiting in the car.

226
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,796
All we have to do
is find out

227
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,234
where the brother's hiding.

228
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,873
Must have been
about a year by now.

229
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,443
He's dead...

230
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,749
at least to me.

231
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,654
If it would
make it easier...

232
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,022
I don't need help
from you

233
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,253
or anyone else, Keaton.

234
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,729
I buried him and forgot
about him a long time ago.

235
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,094
Like you said,

236
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,796
it wasn't my fault,
right?

237
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,378
Last couple of nights
it's been quiet,

238
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,006
too quiet.

239
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,050
I don't like it.

240
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,253
Something the vampires
don't like either.

241
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,890
What do you think
of their story?

242
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,094
What, that the vampires
are gathering?

243
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:32,163
That was a desperate vampire
begging for his life.

244
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,070
He meant that they're
gathering and fleeing,

245
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,801
like animals
from a forest fire

246
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,935
that you can't see yet.

247
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,207
What's that
supposed to mean?

248
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,908
Are we ready
to go yet?

249
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,145
Right, let's go.

250
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,618
Remember:

251
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,884
never trust a vampire.

252
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,928
No, I'm not a doctor,

253
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,898
but I can explain.

254
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,495
Feel free.

255
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,837
They're coming through.

256
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,397
I know these doors.

257
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,500
I've tried to get
through 'em often enough.

258
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,115
We have to get out of here.

259
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,084
No, way.

260
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,518
How?

261
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,579
Let's negotiate
with them.

262
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,886
They're vampires.
They don't negotiate.

263
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,221
You negotiated before.

264
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,851
I was just trying
to buy some time.

265
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,463
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

266
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,768
I trusted you,
"Dr." Rieger.

267
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,967
What was I supposed to say?

268
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,135
"Excuse me. I think
your brother sucks blood,

269
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,543
Can I please just drive
a stake through his heart?"

270
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,980
I'm sorry that stuff
about the cure was a lie.

271
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,745
And I'm not a doctor. But
everything else was the truth.

272
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,093
What the hell was that?

273
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,128
What are they doing?

274
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,528
They're coming through.

275
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,328
We're trapped.

276
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,403
There's coffins in here.

277
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,308
This is a hideout,

278
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,245
which means it's protected from
people getting in, usually.

279
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,479
But there was always
an escape route...

280
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,086
for emergencies.

281
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,783
Great.

282
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,873
Tom, they won't hurt you.

283
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,841
Wait.
What do you mean?

284
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,537
I'm gonna go get help.

285
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,640
Trust me.

286
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,774
Oh, yeah.

287
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,616
Hey, you are not gonna
die here today.

288
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,280
I promise.

289
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,622
What if they're already waiting
for you on the other side?

290
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,995
Try and buy me
a little time.

291
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,369
She isn't here.

292
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,209
You think she's
already yours?

293
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,653
More of us are waiting
on the other side, bitch!

294
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,623
It's gonna be
a very short breakout.

295
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,796
Take him to the bunker.

296
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,457
We still need him.

297
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,540
What's your plan, Carrie?

298
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,599
What's your play?

299
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,274
She should be
through by now.

300
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,107
She's still here.

301
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,674
The door.
The door!

302
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,082
Ha!

303
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,061
Caught us with our pants down.

304
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,994
Yeah.

305
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,698
Stay by the door.

306
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,702
Against the wall.

307
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,799
Keaton.

308
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,183
It's Sid.

309
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,082
His skull's been crushed.

310
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,179
Any bite marks?

311
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,156
No.

312
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,855
Guys?

313
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,557
I think there's something
over there.

314
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,439
Stay by the door.

315
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,982
One of Pashek's people?

316
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,247
No.

317
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,757
Black stake.

318
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,000
Keaton.

319
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,511
Where are the others?

320
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,923
Did you see him?

321
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,961
Yes.

322
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,054
I was with Clayton.

323
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,463
Jill, where
are the others?

324
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,462
It's gonna be okay.

325
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,700
I...

326
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,037
saw the Devil.

327
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,978
They're still here.

328
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,708
Fuck. They're
still here.

329
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:28,344
Protect his brother

330
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,880
and do not let him

331
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,152
find him.

332
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:43,161
Vlad Kossei.

333
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,725
Against the wall.
See this?

334
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:46,771
Yeah.

335
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,298
Paralyzes them.

336
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,268
Can you use a gun?

337
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,940
Okay, you are now
a vampire hunter.

338
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,314
Flash first, shoot second.

339
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,615
And don't shoot at us.

340
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,145
- Okay?
- Okay.

341
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,557
Carrie, it's too late.
Come on, leave her.

342
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,220
Nothing you can do.

343
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,955
I'm sorry.

344
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,817
Me upstairs,
you downstairs?

345
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,683
Whatever it is,
we need it alive.

346
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,266
Shit!

347
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,468
- I said don't shoot!
- Shit!

348
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,228
He just moved.

349
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,811
Dead.

350
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,036
It doesn't take long for
vampires to decompose.

351
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,546
They may twitch a bit
when the gases escape.

352
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,106
Showtime!

353
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,672
Don't'!

354
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,571
We have to find out
what happened here.

355
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:09,978
Shit!

356
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,645
Hold him!

357
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,220
Leave him.

358
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,689
It will hold.

359
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,334
Told you.

360
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,176
Whose group are you with?

361
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,913
Whose group?

362
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,015
Do you understand us?

363
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,212
Of course he understands us.

364
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,984
He will kill you first.

365
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,356
He will kill all of you.

366
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,193
He will drink your blood!

367
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,232
Who's your master?

368
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,893
And what's with these stakes?

369
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:35,735
Come on, bitch.
I'll fuck you

370
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,436
and you will love it.

371
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,446
Shh.

372
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,749
Kid, you better
get out of here now.

373
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,448
He's gotta learn sometime.

374
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,582
Baby, let me free.

375
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,594
We can fight like men.

376
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,121
It won't do you any good.

377
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,158
No matter what you do, it
won't do you any good at all.

378
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,899
He's back, and
you'll be first!

379
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,271
Do you understand?

380
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,242
He already knows you.

381
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,243
What are you guys gonna do?

382
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,454
We're gonna make him talk.

383
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,853
Vlad Kossei!

384
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,124
What did you say?

385
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,291
Vlad Kossei.

386
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,303
Vlad Kossei!

387
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,863
I can't believe I didn't
see this straightaway.

388
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,409
We can't keep him
here forever.

389
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,206
Not forever,

390
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,443
but if we interrogate him
using the hooks now,

391
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:56,044
we'll only get one chance
and he'll probably lie anyway.

392
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,089
A couple of days without blood,
he'll sing like a bird.

393
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,124
About what?

394
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,557
Vlad Kossei,

395
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,891
the Devil himself.

396
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,166
Derek.

397
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,774
What a pretty name,
really.

398
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:24,142
How long have you been
a vampire hunter?

399
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,980
I got this in the
Carpathian Mountains.

400
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,249
They're in Transylvania.

401
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,654
I know.
I remember.

402
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,522
The figures match.

403
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,289
It must be some kind of

404
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,627
vampire rune to repel evil,

405
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,997
or attract it.
I don't know.

406
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:48,164
There's blood in here,
vampire blood.

407
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,333
These things haven't been used
for hundreds of years.

408
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,843
Have you killed before?

409
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,542
It's a fantastic feeling.

410
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:03,519
It makes you feel

411
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,318
powerful.

412
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,762
Jill gave this to me
before she died.

413
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,527
She said she'd seen
the Devil himself.

414
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,565
What is this Vlad Kossei?

415
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,508
Just a vampire ghost story,
that's all.

416
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,411
But... well,

417
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,712
it was extremely cold
in the 12th century.

418
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:37,220
They say it was like
a mini ice age.

419
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,257
It snowed until June.
Crops failed all over Europe.

420
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,054
The first cases
of the Plague broke out.

421
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,095
It was a bad time,

422
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,392
even for the vampires.

423
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,298
The vampire sovereigns
needed to blame someone

424
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,097
for the situation.

425
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,103
They needed a scapegoat.

426
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,766
Hence, Vlad Kossei,

427
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,605
"the Devil himself."

428
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:06,610
But I don't think
he really existed.

429
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,085
But someone's trying to convince
the vampires that he does.

430
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,088
Maybe it's a young vampire

431
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:16,889
trying to get ahead
using the old legends.

432
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,795
Killing vampire hunters is a
great way to attract attention.

433
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,062
He's either pretending to be
Vlad Kossei

434
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,071
or says that
he can defeat him.

435
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,906
Maybe it's one who refuses to
subordinate to the ancients.

436
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,446
That would mean war.

437
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:41,611
We've seen that before.
Reminded me of a vampire rune.

438
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,713
I never gave it
another thought.

439
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:45,890
I'm the first vampire you've
ever seen, aren't I, Derek?

440
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,327
I'm the first vampire you've
ever seen, aren't I, Derek?

441
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,724
I have to confess something.

442
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,326
The binds on my arm
are loose.

443
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:02,998
I think I might even be
able to free myself.

444
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,703
What harm could I do
with one arm free?

445
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,313
That crazy bitch
would probably just

446
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,748
cut off another
one of my fingers.

447
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,346
Even I know that

448
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:23,723
I could use
a friend down here.

449
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,661
Would you be my friend?

450
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,890
Will you?

451
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,170
I'm gonna drive over
to Parker's,

452
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,676
see if I can get
some of his guys.

453
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,008
We can't survive
another attack.

454
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,547
There's only two of us.

455
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,015
So, tighten the binds

456
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,212
and tell those
crazy assholes out there

457
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,881
that I'm cooperating.

458
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,891
Will you do that for me?

459
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,554
Please, Derek?

460
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,460
Please?

461
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,366
What about the kid?

462
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,403
Well, he wanted to be
a vampire hunter.

463
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,867
Now he is one.

464
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,238
Help help!

465
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:32,094
I wasn't going to hurt him.

466
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,597
Derek, you have to
believe me.

467
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,394
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

468
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,900
There you go.

469
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:38,935
I have a good heart.

470
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,800
You all right?

471
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,566
If you are
even going to believe

472
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,541
an old vampire like me,

473
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,100
such a good heart...

474
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,016
Do something with it.

475
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,788
Hello there.

476
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,586
Showtime.

477
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:09,227
You can't maim a prisoner

478
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,325
for trying to escape.

479
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,495
Hold him.

480
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,615
Hold him.

481
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,927
Jesus.

482
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,575
It broke off.

483
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,911
We will "talk" later.

484
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,969
Why is he
so important?

485
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,005
We have to find her.

486
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,233
We cannot let her
leave this house.

487
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:04,705
I can still take any
one of you,

488
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,181
so find her!

489
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,963
Get her up.

490
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,850
Caught so quickly.

491
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,380
You didn't learn
that from me.

492
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,430
You're nothing
since I left.

493
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,860
At least I didn't let them
bite me like you did.

494
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,665
Now listen to me, Carrie.

495
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,968
You have to tell me where
this brother is hidden.

496
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,065
If you help me,

497
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,076
I can help you.

498
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,046
What about your boss...

499
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,448
your precious master?

500
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,510
- If he's so all-knowing...
- Don't throw your life away.

501
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,384
Maybe he'll make
you one of us, hmm?

502
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,561
Then we can be
together again,

503
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,895
this time forever.

504
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,797
Matt, you can't cheat death
without paying for it.

505
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,898
But we do.

506
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,608
What do you dream about

507
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,980
when you sleep
in your coffin?

508
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,818
What do you dream about?

509
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:07,227
A price we vampires
have to pay for immortality.

510
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,661
Think about what it is
you used to fight for.

511
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,168
You can do it.

512
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:21,109
You don't know what
it means to be a vampire.

513
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,671
My name is Fork now,

514
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,945
and believe me, I'm
nothing like I used to be.

515
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,871
Where are you hiding
the bastard?

516
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,941
I can take you there.

517
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,680
The apartment with
the pictures on the wall...

518
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,119
yes, we've been there.

519
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,786
We've been watching you.

520
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,658
You were the first one
to turn us on

521
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,027
to Clayton and his brother.

522
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,864
We would have known nothing
about them if it wasn't for you.

523
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,470
She smells like fear.

524
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,037
It's like I said,
she doesn't know anything.

525
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,743
Useless. Kill her.
Bring me Clayton.

526
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,615
Maybe we can
still use her.

527
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,154
There's another
hiding place.

528
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,453
Sure, my dear.

529
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,690
And what will you give me
if I let you live?

530
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,329
St. George, the dragon slayer,

531
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,703
patron saint
of all vampire hunters.

532
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,934
Your friend here
used to wear the same amulet.

533
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,470
But now he belongs to me.

534
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,790
So close to death,

535
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,723
yet there's still
one question

536
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,489
burning deep inside,
isn't there?

537
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,826
I can see it in your eyes.

538
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,041
Who is Vlad Kossei?

539
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:41,477
This is the third time
I ran away. I can't go back.

540
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,813
Who cares?

541
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,684
You're old enough.
You can do whatever you want.

542
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,450
Stop whimpering.

543
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,153
Stop bleeding.

544
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,189
Is it true your boyfriend
became a vampire?

545
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,727
He's dead.

546
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,771
All vampires
are already dead.

547
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,572
He can't breathe.

548
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:12,448
Did you forget already?
He tried to kill you.

549
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,746
Jesus Christ,
he could kill us all.

550
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,285
Yeah, I know.

551
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,747
No you don't.

552
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,950
Look at him.

553
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,727
Look at him!

554
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,322
You don't know them.

555
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,230
You don't know
what they're like.

556
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,495
They're not human.

557
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,834
Look at his cold, dead eyes.

558
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,966
He doesn't give a flying fuck
about you or your dreams!

559
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,339
They just bite you!

560
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,872
Never show pity.

561
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,375
You got a lot to learn,
Derek.

562
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,319
So I can be like you?

563
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:01,789
What's wrong?

564
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,990
It's getting light.

565
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:11,069
And he's scared to death.

566
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,133
He can't see you,
he can't hear you anymore.

567
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:17,237
He can't feel
anything anymore,

568
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,640
not until this evening.

569
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,018
Sunlight petrifies them.

570
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,322
Best time to kill them.

571
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,332
We track them
during the day,

572
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,834
smoke them out
of their hideouts,

573
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,598
and watch them burn
in the sunlight.

574
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,731
We hunt them during the day,
they hunt us at night.

575
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,641
I thought you were gonna
bring Parker's people.

576
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,087
Parker's dead...

577
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,621
rubbed out.
The whole group,

578
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,626
just like us.

579
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,121
Wilson's group too.

580
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,098
We're the only ones left.

581
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:15,195
You have to find out where
Clayton's hiding his brother.

582
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,467
Three groups
of vampire hunters

583
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,668
in one fucking day.

584
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,306
Chris is an architect.

585
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,867
His offices specialized
in restoring old buildings.

586
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,312
- They got jobs from...
- Was this a church?

587
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,509
Yeah.

588
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,981
This was his last project,

589
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,546
a dirty old church
in Romania

590
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,149
the communists
used as a pigpen.

591
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,788
He always had
a photographer with him.

592
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,739
He was really
proud of these

593
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,306
old drawings
on the church walls.

594
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,251
They were discovered
during restoration.

595
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,019
They were hidden in an old
walled-up crypt,

596
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,856
drawings of the passion
of Christ.

597
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,692
They must be really ancient.

598
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,359
He was really excited
about it.

599
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,902
He thought it was going to be
this huge discovery.

600
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,476
And then he
started to change.

601
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,071
At first I thought it
was just work and stress.

602
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,343
Then it got worse
from day to day.

603
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,822
I told him he should
go see a doctor again.

604
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,489
That was the day

605
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,255
I started becoming
afraid of him.

606
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,589
It was like he was
slowly transforming

607
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,693
into someone else.

608
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,674
Did he take
anything with him,

609
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,939
some kind of object,
anything special?

610
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,242
Why?

611
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,252
Because this isn't
the passion of Christ.

612
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,714
Christ wasn't burned.

613
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,652
This was a warning
to the people.

614
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,221
What is this?

615
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:25,886
I didn't know
what to do.

616
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,862
Hey!
Can you hear me?

617
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,126
He's not feeling good.
What's wrong with him?

618
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,760
- When's Keaton coming back?
- He's off doing research.

619
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,342
He needs blood.
He needs warm, fresh blood.

620
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,140
Damn it!

621
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:52,145
Watch his hands.

622
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,883
If he starts to wake up,

623
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,187
he's gonna move first
and try to bite me.

624
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,968
Give me that crowbar.

625
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,634
I need to open his mouth.
Get me the crowbar.

626
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,176
Never thought I'd
have to feed a vampire.

627
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,045
That's good.

628
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,664
That's enough!

629
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,833
I know why your blood
tastes so good.

630
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,707
It's the hate in you!
I can taste it.

631
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,178
You think you're better
than us, don't you, hunter?

632
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,044
But you're just like us.

633
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,676
You kill because
you love it!

634
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,050
What is this?

635
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,089
This is a church in Romania.

636
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,055
What did they find
in that church?

637
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,489
The fools!

638
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:11,056
You're curious friend
didn't just find anything.

639
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:14,535
He found Vlad Kossei!

640
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:25,539
What do you know of
Vlad Kossei and his power?

641
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,583
Nothing.

642
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,017
Oh, you might have read
something in books.

643
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,786
But I was there.

644
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,423
I was there
when I burned him,

645
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,796
when I tracked him down
800 years ago.

646
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,867
We thought we had gotten rid
of him once and for all,

647
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:53,807
the monster Vlad Kossei.

648
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,272
We vampires
are not monsters.

649
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,080
We're not like Vlad Kossei.

650
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,782
We maintained the balance
with the humans

651
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,586
in our home long ago.

652
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:13,322
They feared
and respected us.

653
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,263
They were happy

654
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,596
because we protected them

655
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,501
as a shepherd
protects his sheep.

656
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,739
But then,

657
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,780
one day,

658
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:36,582
one day he came...

659
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:43,550
Vlad Kossei.

660
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,629
His thirst for blood
was unquenchable.

661
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,032
He would wipe out entire
villages in one night.

662
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,501
It was a nightmare.

663
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:59,872
The humans formed an army,
a pitiful force.

664
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,969
He swept them away
before the battle even began.

665
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:06,072
He destroyed them
from within.

666
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:12,115
Deceit and treachery were
his most powerful weapons.

667
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,919
Deceit and treachery,

668
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,256
that's what we learned
from him.

669
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,853
We vampires couldn't
defeat him on our own,

670
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,693
we knew that much.

671
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,360
So we formed a secret alliance
with the humans.

672
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,667
We made a pact to destroy
Vlad Kossei.

673
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,572
Vampires and humans...

674
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,906
he wasn't expecting that.

675
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:37,742
We pledged allegiance
to Kossei,

676
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:41,147
gained his trust,
then drew him into a trap.

677
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,878
He underestimated us.

678
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,080
That was his failing.

679
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:56,289
Your St. George
did not defeat a dragon.

680
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,767
He defeated Vlad Kossei.

681
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,664
I am your St. George!

682
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,339
But he wasn't dead.

683
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,852
Ultimately we had to tie
him to a scaffold.

684
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:21,084
We stacked wood beneath it

685
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:24,524
and then burned the flesh
from his bones.

686
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,425
Some thought
he was a demon,

687
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,363
an evil spirit
in a vampire's body.

688
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,990
So the humans
took the bones

689
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,501
and brought them
to their final resting place

690
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,094
for dangerous spirits.

691
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:38,572
They sealed him
in an altar in their church.

692
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,904
He was practically
dead already

693
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,847
the instant he was
bit by Vlad Kossei.

694
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:52,443
Your wayward friend
has become Vlad Kossei!

695
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:58,455
The fools woke
the Devil himself!

696
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,495
What does that mean?

697
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:05,193
He will cut the smiles
from your faces.

698
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,131
You will learn
what true fear is,

699
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,471
what true pain feels like.

700
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,877
It means that Vlad Kossei
is back.

701
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,278
You need me

702
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,411
more than I need you.

703
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:29,151
I could destroy him before
he regains his power,

704
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,888
before his transformation
is complete.

705
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,487
But he will become
invincible

706
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:39,023
when he destroys
the last link.

707
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,006
What link?

708
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,532
We should work
together...

709
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:53,605
humans and vampires.

710
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,117
It's the only way
to defeat him.

711
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:58,949
We have to
start by...

712
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,287
trusting each other.

713
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,850
What link does he
have to destroy?

714
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:10,365
Maybe I'll remember

715
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:14,062
if I could drink
a little more blood.

716
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,401
Okay.

717
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,600
Derek, I need
you to help me.

718
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,242
I know this is gonna
be gross,

719
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,678
but it's our only chance
to get him to talk straight.

720
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:26,715
He won't last.

721
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:30,378
Vlad Kossei has to kill
his brother!

722
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,318
That's it.

723
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:36,484
His spirit is dependant
on the blood in his veins!

724
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:41,155
As long as that same blood
still exists in another person,

725
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:46,099
he will only become
a shadow of his true self.

726
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:48,729
Do you understand?

727
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,272
He would have to
kill his parents

728
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,533
if they were still alive...

729
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,404
or his children.

730
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,912
But he definitely
has to kill his brother.

731
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:02,343
But he won't
kill his brother himself.

732
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,818
He won't murder
his own blood.

733
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:09,688
He would instantly lose the
connection to his new body.

734
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:14,321
That's why he will need
a new ally.

735
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,297
Your hate

736
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,339
blinds
you to reality.

737
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:29,003
Vlad Kossei wanted you to know
that he'd been found.

738
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,809
You're already part
of his plan.

739
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:36,443
He wants to use you

740
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,612
to kill his brother.

741
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:40,848
What?

742
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,160
But his plan will fail.

743
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,400
The vampires will take his
brother someplace totally safe,

744
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,768
safe from you

745
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,273
and Vlad Kossei.

746
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,248
Derek, stay here.

747
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,457
Tom?

748
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,466
Tom Tom!

749
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,297
Hello, Carrie.

750
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,540
Too slow again.

751
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,822
It's nothing.
It's nothing. I'm fine.

752
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:57,926
As you can see,

753
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,128
your efforts to save
your new friend have failed.

754
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:05,504
Just like the last time,
what I want I take.

755
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,305
Vlad Kossei will kill you.

756
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,870
I'm not afraid of him.

757
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,006
I've defeated him once.

758
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,141
I'll defeat him again.

759
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,381
Not unless humans and vampires
work together again.

760
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:22,015
You won't be needing this
anymore, hunter.

761
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,355
Take her to my coffin.

762
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,394
- No!
- Hold her!

763
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,763
- It's him!
- Impossible!

764
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,389
- No, he can't be!
- It can't be him.

765
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,093
It's her people,
vampire hunters.

766
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,534
No, I can feel him!

767
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,538
Get us out of here.

768
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,006
You stay here.
You'll be safer here.

769
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,238
Vlad Kossei.

770
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,543
Vlad Kossei!

771
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,918
Here.

772
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:05,160
You should have killed me.
Do you remember?

773
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,201
You had the chance.

774
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,499
Next time I will kill you.

775
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,806
Matt, Vlad Kossei is here
to kill his brother.

776
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,401
You can't defeat him
on your own.

777
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,380
Even now you think
you can still save me.

778
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,440
You should have left the vampire
hunters long ago.

779
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,976
You don't belong there.
It's not your war.

780
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,920
Try to get a life,
a real life.

781
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,824
Matt,

782
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,162
come with me.

783
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:42,136
You're not responsible
for saving the world.

784
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:05,192
I always knew
you would return,

785
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,559
I really did.

786
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:18,405
I realized a lot,
all these years.

787
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,410
I realized
you are my refuge.

788
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:54,605
Please, not like this.

789
01:06:57,113 --> 01:07:00,742
I'm the heir of Imraz.

790
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:04,843
not in this shabby room.

791
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:14,790
Do you think it's him?

792
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,264
Vlad Kossei couldn't
have found us.

793
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,665
We have to get to the ship.

794
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,394
It's Vlad Kossei.

795
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,695
Do you understand?

796
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,332
Go.

797
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,904
Matt,

798
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,474
It's all right.

799
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,412
I'm all right.

800
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:51,024
Matt, where
did you take Tom?

801
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:52,822
It's too late.

802
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,425
He won.

803
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,726
It will be light soon.

804
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,700
Do you think I'll
be able to see the sun

805
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,004
one last time?

806
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,247
You were right.

807
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:19,720
It's always daytime
in my dreams.

808
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,703
Tom, you okay?

809
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,443
I thought I was
gonna die in here.

810
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,716
You're not gonna die today,
remember? I promised you.

811
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,290
Lucky thing
no safety locks, huh?

812
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,852
Your brother is in here
somewhere

813
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,454
and he wants to kill you.

814
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:37,760
He has to kill you.

815
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,994
It's the only way he can get
his full power back.

816
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,435
That's absurd. He could have
killed me the whole time.

817
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,062
No, he can't do it himself.

818
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,801
He has to find someone else
to do it for him,

819
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,070
which means we have to kill
everyone we see,

820
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,409
no matter who it is.

821
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,831
Get us out of here.

822
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,834
I think your brother's probably
gonna be by the exit.

823
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,893
Do you remember that little
room with the escape hatch?

824
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,166
He won't know about that.

825
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,648
Is that him?

826
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:28,683
Yeah.

827
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,316
Who are you?

828
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,118
You're never gonna
get your brother.

829
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,093
Run!

830
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,508
Hey!

831
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,617
Shoot him!

832
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,718
No no no!

833
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:28,001
I don't know what you had
planned, Vlad Kossei,

834
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,339
but it didn't work.

835
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,757
He wasn't
your brother anymore.

836
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:59,104
We were holding this one
captive.

837
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,335
He must have freed himself.

838
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,510
It means
the others are dead.

839
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,607
Derek, Carrie was right.

840
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:14,078
She couldn't hold
a vampire captive.

841
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,931
Where did she go?

842
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:40,113
You've been hit.

843
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,116
Tom, no.

844
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:53,094
God help me.

845
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:56,996
Come on, stay awake.

846
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,403
That's my truck.
I'm gonna go get help.

847
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,100
Don't give up on me now,
okay?

848
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,146
- Where's Keaton?
- Have you seen our vampire?

849
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,651
- He's dead.
- What?

850
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,653
Calm down.
He's dead.

851
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,052
So is Vlad Kossei.

852
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,296
Vlad Kossei isn't dead.

853
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:33,334
Where did she go?

854
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,341
Don't be afraid.

855
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,809
Where did she go?

856
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,472
To the brother.

857
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,845
I think his name is Tom.

858
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,443
Damn!

859
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,988
I killed Vlad Kossei
myself.

860
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,590
Both brothers were in
Transylvania.

861
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,600
One of them injured himself
on the bones on the altar.

862
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,904
It wasn't the architect.

863
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,635
That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

864
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:17,201
It was the photographer,
his brother.

865
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,175
He managed to hide
the other brother

866
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:49,870
and secretly bring him here.

867
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,572
We wanted to join the other
vampires

868
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,512
as soon as it was safe.

869
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,260
I'm one of the vampires

870
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:11,390
who was supposed to stop
Vlad Kossei.

871
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,060
Do you understand?

872
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:17,936
We saw that you
contacted him.

873
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,530
We couldn't trust anyone.

874
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,200
Wait here.

875
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,711
He played us all
against each other.

876
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:32,315
We're just marionettes.

877
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,388
He needed me
to kill his brother.

878
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,690
That's all he wanted.

879
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,776
Tom knew he'd be here today.

880
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,004
Too late.

881
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,066
Something's painted
on the wall.

882
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:28,534
Yeah, I know.

883
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,533
He can't be far.

884
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,546
What are you thinking?

885
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,377
Derek, go home.

886
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,653
Try and get yourself
a life,

887
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,385
a real life.

888
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:09,306
Hey, I thought that
Vlad Kossei is invulnerable

889
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,709
now that his brother's dead.

890
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,145
Invulnerable or not,

891
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:16,007
I'm gonna get
that bastard.

892
