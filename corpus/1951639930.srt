1
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:24,469
Max!

2
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,470
Uh-huh?

3
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:27,347
Ready to concede?

4
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,766
No!

5
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,824
I thought as it's
your last night here,

6
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:49,911
it only appropriate that we
open something extra special.

7
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,079
Bandol.

8
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:52,455
Excellent choice.

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,210
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

10
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:00,839
The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.

11
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:05,010
I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

12
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:06,469
collapse in a heap

13
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,556
after drinking just a single glass.

14
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,309
Perhaps my knee landing
squarely in his testicles...

15
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:16,604
...may have been partly to blame.

16
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,023
What was I talking about before?

17
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:19,941
You said the importance
of a good blue suit

18
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,234
can never be overstated.

19
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:22,861
Quite right.

20
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:25,739
A blue suit is the most
versatile of accoutrements.

21
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,657
More important
than the suit itself

22
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,451
is the man who fits it for you.

23
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:31,286
Once you find a good tailor,

24
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,371
you must never give his name away,

25
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:35,707
not even under the threat

26
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:37,208
of bodily harm.

27
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:44,924
Now, where were we?

28
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,843
-Whose turn is it?
-Mine.

29
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,720
Uh-huh.

30
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,683
Uh-huh.

31
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,977
Max, have I told you why I enjoy

32
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:57,771
-making wine so much?
-You don't

33
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:00,190
make the wine, Uncle Henry,
that guy Duflot does.

34
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,525
In France,
it's always the landowner

35
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,653
who makes the wine.

36
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,238
Even though he does
nothing more than supervise

37
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:10,408
with binoculars
from the comfort of his study.

38
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,371
No, I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar

39
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:17,749
is quite simply incapable of lying.

40
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:20,210
Picked too early,
picked too late, it matters not.

41
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:23,213
The wine will always whisper
into your mouth

42
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,382
with complete, unabashed honesty,

43
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,677
every time you take a sip.

44
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,097
Mmm,

45
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:33,682
delightful.

46
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:35,725
Now, Maximillian,

47
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,269
now you know why
I love wine so much,

48
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,939
have you anything
you want to tell me?

49
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:42,065
Yes, I do.

50
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,733
Yes, what is it?

51
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,240
Checkmate.

52
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:53,034
You little shit.

53
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:11,469
-Good morning, lab rats.
-Good morning, Max.

54
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,221
Today we're shifting gear.

55
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,890
Today... is Greedy Bastard Day.

56
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,603
The secret to riches, lab rats,

57
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:24,816
is the same as the secret to comedy...

58
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,401
timing.

59
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,029
-115. 10, Max.

60
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,197
So I thought we should move now.

61
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:33,283
-Not yet, Alf.
-Boss,

62
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,534
why do you keep calling me Alf?

63
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,536
Because you're an aggressive
little flunky, Kenny.

64
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:37,620
And as your boss

65
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,205
and genetic superior,

66
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,207
I can call you whatever I want.

67
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,418
Max Skinner's phone.

68
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:44,961
It's Kimberly.
Is Max there?

69
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,463
Yeah. One moment, please.

70
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,214
It's Kimberly.

71
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,553
-Sorry, Kimberly, Max isn't here.
-Where is he?

72
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:54,763
He and his fiancée

73
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:56,514
are at their wedding
rehearsal today.

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,266
-Their what?
-Do you want me to leave him a message?

75
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,976
No, I don't want
to leave him a message!

76
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,269
Okay.

77
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,064
115. 90...

78
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:07,317
116...

79
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:08,485
116. 10.

80
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,903
All right, lab rats, just remember

81
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:11,404
we're not here for the dental plan.

82
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:14,532
50 big!
People are buying! Max?

83
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:16,076
Sell.

84
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,290
That's yours!

85
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:26,419
I said that's yours!

86
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,719
That miserable sod Skinner's
dumping bonds

87
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,721
-onto the market.
-But he can't do that.

88
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,181
There's a gentleman's agreement
on the exchange.

89
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,100
A gentleman's agreement presupposes

90
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,185
-there's a gentleman involved.
-Amis,

91
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,521
he put out $5 billion
in sell orders-prices are

92
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:46,022
-crashing through the floor!
-Come on,

93
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,107
people, get off your asses!

94
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,818
Come on, step to it!
Start selling!

95
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,486
-Sell!

96
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,324
They should bury you
face down, Max,

97
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,952
because that's the way you're going.

98
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:08,878
Free big figures to 113. 50!

99
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,630
Sell! Sell!

100
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,215
Still going down.

101
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,633
Buy.

102
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,218
Fuckin' buy it all back!

103
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,053
Buy it all back immediately!

104
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,555
Buy it all back!
It's yours to buy back!

105
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,598
Don't worry about it!
Buy it all back!

106
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:22,100
You're a genius, Max!

107
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,563
Filthy bugger,
he's forced down prices.

108
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,690
He's gonna buy everything back
on the cheap!

109
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,442
Start buying!

110
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,901
Buying now! Start buying!

111
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,832
-I can!
-I can!

112
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,126
Well done today, lab rats.

113
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,252
Wonderful work.

114
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,796
We all made
a spectacular amount of money.

115
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,008
Today we proved the adage that

116
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:57,010
winning isn't everything...

117
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:59,095
It's the only thing!

118
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:11,483
And there were strange goings-on

119
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:12,692
on the bond market today.

120
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:17,280
Prices crashed to 112. 5,
after Lorden Brothers

121
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:20,033
unloaded $3 billion in sell orders.

122
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:23,453
Then in an extraordinary
move, the company bought the bonds back

123
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:25,163
at a substantially reduced price,

124
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:27,624
making over $77 million

125
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:30,377
-in the process.
-Blimey.

126
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,836
Cries of foul play were loud

127
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:35,799
and widespread, with talks
of an inquiry to follow.

128
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:38,134
Morning, Mr. Skinner.

129
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,470
-Morning, Bert.
-And congratulations.

130
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,347
-Thank you.
-You might've tipped me off,

131
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:43,598
Mr. Skinner.

132
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,642
I'll give you a tip, Bert:

133
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,645
Never pat a burning dog.

134
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,231
Wanker.

135
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:41,823
Oh, Henry, bloody hell.

136
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,660
<i>Ready for the fan mail?</i>

137
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:47,620
Shoot, sunshine.

138
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:49,205
-"Bastard. "
-Uh-huh.

139
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:50,081
"Bastard. "

140
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:50,832
Uh-huh.

141
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:52,083
-"Burn in hell. "
-Right.

142
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,335
"Rot in hell. "

143
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,294
Oh. Lovely.

144
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:55,253
"Die. "

145
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:55,920
Charming.

146
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,047
Maxie?

147
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:58,840
"Congratulations, you're my hero. "

148
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,383
Who said that?

149
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,217
Your lawyer.

150
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,260
-Oh.
-Maxie, listen,

151
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:05,347
I just got off the phone
with, uh, Auzet.

152
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:08,266
That's the notaire handling
your Uncle Henry's estate.

153
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,559
She the one that sent me the letter?

154
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,728
Yeah.

155
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:15,231
Anyway, listen, uh, it seems that

156
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:16,441
your Uncle Henry

157
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,942
hasn't updated his will

158
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,277
in over 20 years.

159
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:21,196
Which is why,
in typical frog fashion,

160
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,489
they take over a month

161
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:23,490
to notify us.

162
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:25,158
All right, so what do we do with that?

163
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:26,326
Is there a reading of the will,

164
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:27,410
or do we just download

165
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:29,287
that sort of thing these days?
What happens?

166
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:31,623
No, that's the point, Max.

167
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:33,708
Sorry?

168
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,251
There is no legal will.

169
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:36,252
Really?

170
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:37,629
You're his closest blood relative,

171
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:40,298
-so you get everything.
-What, his clothes

172
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:41,758
and his Edmundo Ross LPs?

173
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:44,427
The house, you git.

174
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,137
You get to keep his house.

175
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,347
What, the old farmhouse

176
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,140
and the vineyards and
the grapes and everything?

177
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,936
Place like must be worth
a few quid these days.

178
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,562
Hey.

179
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,814
-Hmm.
-Anyway,

180
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:58,274
I've booked you a flight

181
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:01,528
and an appointment with Auzet
for 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

182
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,279
Just a few papers to sign.

183
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:04,781
Come on, I can't go
to France tomorrow.

184
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,199
Gem, I'm the toast of the town.

185
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:07,617
I need to do a few victory laps

186
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,411
around the city,
show off a little bit,

187
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:11,037
have a late night or two.
Oh, come on,

188
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,664
you heard the mail-
it's times like this,

189
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,457
when everyone hates you,
that's when it's fun.

190
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:15,750
Go on, Max-we'll take good care

191
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,918
of the place when you're gone.

192
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,253
No problems.

193
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:19,421
Right.

194
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:21,172
-Ken.
-Mm.

195
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:22,674
Why don't you go and try and find

196
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,967
some small animals to hurt?

197
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:27,637
I know, find a poodle and
punt it off the balcony.

198
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,229
Hmm?

199
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:37,814
-Tell me something, Max.
-Yes?

200
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:39,816
Did you care for him?

201
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,319
Yes, I did.

202
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,739
When was the last time you spoke?

203
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:46,948
A long time ago.

204
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,074
Why?

205
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:49,284
Well, I don't know, Gemma.

206
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,827
That's probably got
something to do

207
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,329
with me becoming an asshole.

208
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,166
Okay.

209
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:15,769
Max!

210
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,604
-Hello, how are you?
-How are you?

211
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,856
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

212
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,442
I'm looking so much forward
to gloating through the room.

213
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,362
Oh, well, follow me.

214
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,742
-Danny, how are you?
-Congratulations.

215
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,535
-Thank you. Austin.
-Max, congratulations.

216
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:33,745
Say hello to your dad for me.

217
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,705
Oh, love, mm.
How are you doing?

218
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:37,415
-Very well. How are you?
-Oh, Lucy.

219
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,834
-Hello.
-I didn't realize that you two knew each other.

220
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:40,877
Whoops.

221
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,254
He's adorable.

222
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:48,635
Mm, magnificent bouquet.

223
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,053
Alluring nose.

224
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,179
Honey and spice.

225
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:53,139
And all things nice.

226
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:55,558
Inspection of the polyphenolics
reveals magnificent hues

227
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:58,061
of brick red,
indicative of a mature Bordeaux.

228
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,563
It's a burgundy.

229
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:03,233
Yes, I knew it's burgundy.

230
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:04,442
One for you, sir?

231
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,904
I think I shall have an eclipse.

232
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,280
-Thank you.
-Charles, can we get

233
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:11,241
our minds off the double
frontage with the view

234
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,617
and onto the French real estate?

235
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:13,827
What do you think it's worth?

236
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,829
Max, barely a day has passed
since you learned

237
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:17,080
of the long-lost uncle's

238
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:19,207
departure from this world,

239
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:21,042
and all you can think of is money.

240
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,794
The very same uncle you're
talking about, Charles, is

241
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,754
the man who taught me every man
needs a fuck-you million.

242
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,424
Okay, when are you gonna
furnish me with the particulars,

243
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,842
because an estate agent
needs something

244
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:29,926
he can sink his teeth into.

245
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:32,595
Well, uh, it's been a while

246
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,723
since I've been there,
but from memory,

247
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,475
at least half a dozen
bedrooms, a pool, tennis...

248
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,019
court, a decent-sized kitchen...

249
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:42,105
-Thanks.
-11 hectares, a vineyard.

250
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:44,899
Bloody hell, Max, it sounds
like an estate to me, a château.

251
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,277
What's a château go for these days?

252
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:50,030
Well, we're obviously in the
"F-You" department, aren't we?

253
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:51,489
-Maybe several.
-Really?

254
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,450
God bless Henry.

255
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,576
I won't count my commission.

256
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,910
I wouldn't expect you to, Charles.

257
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,662
That's why I'm fond of you.

258
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,706
Well, in that case, Max...

259
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,500
here's to you.

260
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:35,283
Gemma.

261
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,376
<i>Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

262
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,683
-Yeah?
-Kenny,

263
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,476
I want the current ten-year yield,

264
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,229
I want an update on the figures
for nonfarm payrolls,

265
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:06,439
and I want you to get
your scrawny little backside

266
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,691
out of my chair.

267
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,318
Thank you.

268
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,697
How'd he know that?

269
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:20,745
Lance Armstrong!

270
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,849
Maxie! Hi. How are you?

271
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:42,392
Gemma, come on, love,
admit it: This is

272
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,602
because I didn't shag you
at the Christmas party,

273
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:46,354
-isn't it?
-Listen, I swear on my life,

274
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,732
Max, they didn't have
any other cars.

275
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,985
So, where are we, Max?

276
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:54,612
Oh, for bollocky's sake!

277
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,740
Right, I've gone
to the end of that road...

278
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,950
Look, they're both the D-3.

279
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:01,536
I've got Menerbes on my left,
or I've got Cavaillon on my right,

280
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,496
and they're both on the D-3.

281
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,373
-Go! Go!
-Oh... shut up!

282
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,917
Okay, okay, hang on a minute.
I'll help you. Hang on.

283
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,336
I've got a...
I've got a GPS here

284
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,421
-Go! Go!
-With a stutter and a...

285
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,548
quite frankly,
a shitty, froggy attitude!

286
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:17,302
Okay, listen, you turn left
and that'll take you straight

287
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:20,388
onto the N-7, and if you
really put your foot on it,

288
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:23,600
you might even get
to your appointment on time.

289
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:29,814
-Bollocks! Bugger!

290
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,485
Mission control.

291
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,403
All right, love, please reschedule

292
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:36,988
my meeting with the notaire

293
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:38,365
for first thing tomorrow morning.

294
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:39,366
Okay.

295
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,117
What about the keys, Max?

296
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,453
-Oh, there used to be a stone, you know.
-Uh-huh.

297
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,748
Uh, by the front door. Ask her to put that...
put the keys under the stone,

298
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,792
and I'll, um,
I'll pick them up from there.

299
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,961
Okay, copy that. Copy that.

300
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:14,317
Huh.

301
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:11,666
Hello?

302
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:16,630
Henry?

303
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:06,072
<i>Come on, you're slower than your Aunt Midge!</i>

304
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:10,493
<i>-That's it, Maximillian. </i>

305
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,662
-It's not funny.

306
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:15,040
What are you, a man or a mouse?

307
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,500
Fine, then, I'm a mouse. Squeak, squeak!

308
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:34,643
Hopeless, you're hopeless.

309
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:36,186
Oh, stop it!

310
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:51,451
Match point.

311
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:52,869
Ace!

312
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,537
Game! Set!

313
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:56,915
-Match!
-You cannot be serious!

314
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,291
-Hey.

315
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,794
-You have to rub it in?
-Hey...

316
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,879
The point is, Max, why
you aren't celebrating?

317
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,464
Because I lost!

318
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,466
Well, a man should acknowledge

319
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:12,055
his losses just as gracefully
as he celebrates his victories.

320
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,807
Come on, give us a jig.

321
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,475
Give your old uncle a jig.

322
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,685
-Oh, yeah, I lost.
-Arms and up and down.

323
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:19,771
Yeah, great, yeah, I lost! I lost!

324
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,022
-Uncle Henry won!
-Yes.

325
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:23,108
-Three cheers!
-Dance, don't shimmy like an Italian.

326
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:24,317
Well done, Uncle Henry.

327
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,236
This is stupid.

328
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:28,989
You'll come to see

329
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:31,783
that a man learns
nothing from winning.

330
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:35,245
The act of losing, however,
can elicit great wisdom.

331
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,122
Not least of which is, uh,

332
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,916
how much more enjoyable it is to win.

333
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,086
It's inevitable to lose now and again.

334
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:46,548
The trick is not
to make a habit of it.

335
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:47,757
Drink?

336
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:10,530
Chicken shit.

337
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:12,157
-Excuse me?

338
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:14,326
On the roses.

339
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,703
Oh, fertilizer.

340
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:18,496
Oh, Tati.

341
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:20,540
Hello.

342
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:21,958
Duflot?

343
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,335
<i>Oui. </i>

344
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,628
-Max.
-My God.

345
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:27,672
Haven't you... matured.

346
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,592
<i>Ah, c'est vrai,
the floods of'78, </i>

347
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:33,303
-Right.
-Mistral of'86,

348
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,055
-fanleaf disease in '93.

349
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:36,640
-Fanleaf disease.
-In each vintage I've

350
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:40,101
corked away another
year of my youth.

351
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:41,811
But I still have my wife, Ludivine.

352
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:43,229
-Ludivine.
-Yeah.

353
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,482
<i>And my dog...
ah, voila, Tati. </i>

354
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,318
I expect you're hungry, no?

355
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:49,444
Please, come tonight.

356
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:50,987
My wife is roasting a lamb-mmm!

357
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:52,322
To tell the truth,

358
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:54,032
I haven't had much of an appetite

359
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:55,241
since I learned of Henry.

360
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:58,411
Oh, the very last years,
his sight was failing.

361
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:01,122
But I tended to things
for him, you know?

362
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:03,583
We became very close.

363
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:08,254
Almost like... father and son.

364
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:11,675
Well, I am most appreciative

365
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,093
that someone was here for him.

366
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:15,178
Well, my wife will
come in the morning

367
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:16,471
with croissants, okay?

368
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:18,640
Huh? She will resume her duties.

369
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:21,351
<i>-Allez! Bon!
-If you insist. </i>

370
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:35,657
Hmm.

371
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,494
"Welcome. "

372
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:42,998
Ah.

373
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:45,959
Don't mind if I do.

374
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,800
Here's to you, Henry.

375
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:57,512
Devoting your life to the vines...

376
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,848
and bottling the truth.

377
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,314
Hmm...

378
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,320
That was honest.

379
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:17,824
Jesus, ought to have
a poison sticker on it.

380
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:27,417
Ah... coffee, coffee.

381
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,337
What's in here?

382
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,756
And that?

383
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,342
Piss off.

384
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,139
Hmm.

385
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:43,850
Morning, Henry.

386
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,770
Milk.

387
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,857
Hmm.

388
00:23:58,073 --> 00:23:59,449
Maxie!

389
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:00,492
Madame Duflot!

390
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:02,452
Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

391
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,084
-Oh...
-Morning.

392
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:26,476
Morning, Gemma.

393
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,728
Are you enjoying yourself, Max?

394
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:30,814
Oh, yes, as bereavements go, you know.

395
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:32,315
This will cheer you up.

396
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,692
You've been busted.

397
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:36,653
<i>Morning Financial Times headline:</i>

398
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:39,364
"Lorden Brothers trade
under investigation. "

399
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,783
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

400
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,244
The FSA today launched
an official inquiry

401
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:47,330
into recent Lorden Brothers
trade activity.

402
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:49,332
Yes, well, I double-checked
it all through Legal.

403
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,209
I covered our asses, okay?

404
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:53,586
It's just bollocks to placate
the lucid back.

405
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,213
Oh, he doesn't think so.

406
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:59,217
-Nigel?
-Sir Nigel.

407
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:02,470
He wants a meeting with you today,
5:00 this afternoon.

408
00:25:02,554 --> 00:25:04,848
Well, it must be
about something else.

409
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:06,641
Um, what time is my meeting
with the notaire?

410
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:08,601
A little over an hour from now.

411
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:10,020
My time or yours?

412
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:11,479
Oh, shit.

413
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:13,315
Oh, Gemma!

414
00:25:42,385 --> 00:25:43,678
Yes?

415
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:45,513
How's the house, Max?
Is it gorgeous?

416
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:47,390
Well, to tell you
the truth, Charlie,

417
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:48,642
it's a little bit shabby.

418
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:49,809
We don't say shabby, Max.

419
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:52,020
We say filled with the patina
of a bygone era.

420
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:54,105
-How's the wine?
-Right.

421
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,732
Uh, bouquet of a wet dog.

422
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:57,692
Hits the palate like a razor blade

423
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,903
with a finish that hints of awful.

424
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,279
So the house is falling apart

425
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,697
and the vineyard
makes undrinkable wine?

426
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:03,990
Excellent.

427
00:26:04,074 --> 00:26:06,326
One thing you are going
to need is an oenologue.

428
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:07,577
All right, what's that?

429
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:09,329
It's a sort of licensed wine expert.

430
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,706
They take soil samples-bits of
the vine, that sort of thing-

431
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,875
tests them-there must
be a couple near you.

432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,044
And also, I would need
a couple of sexy snaps

433
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:17,462
to get the punters clamoring,

434
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,674
and I have an e-mail address for
you to send them to, which is...

435
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:23,176
Hold on a second.
I'll just put you on speaker.

436
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,260
Okay, shoot.

437
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:25,261
Provencelistings@

438
00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:29,391
abroadproperties. Inc.

439
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:30,308
Shit.

440
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,352
<i>-Hello?
-Attention!</i>

441
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:35,939
-Hello?
-Shit.

442
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:40,318
-Max?
-All right, go on.

443
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,096
Auzet.

444
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:12,434
Hello.

445
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,352
Max Skinner.

446
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:17,480
The vigneron makes the wine

447
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:21,276
and the estate owner
maintains the property.

448
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:22,277
Mr. Skinner?

449
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:24,946
Yes, hmm, right, well, delightful.

450
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:27,991
This is how your uncle
and Monsieur Duflot

451
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:30,410
worked for over 20 years.

452
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:31,703
Naturally, Monsieur Duflot

453
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:34,080
will be anxious
as to your intentions.

454
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:36,916
I think I can speed this up.

455
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:40,211
I have no intention
of becoming a winemaker.

456
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:44,633
So let Monsieur Duflot
make the wine

457
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,926
and you enjoy the estate
on the weekends.

458
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:48,887
I'm not sure you understand me.

459
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,680
My life is in London.

460
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:52,349
I don't do weekends.

461
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:54,100
I intend to sell La Siroque

462
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,602
as soon as possible.

463
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:57,020
And what about, uh,

464
00:27:57,103 --> 00:27:58,938
Monsieur and Madame Duflot?

465
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:00,774
Look, in all cases like this,
it simply

466
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,108
just comes down to a figure.

467
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,986
Well, if there's nothing else,
I have a plane to catch.

468
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:07,280
Right.

469
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,132
You're selling La Siroque?

470
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,009
There has been a mistake, I think.

471
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:29,511
News travels fast.

472
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:32,389
But your uncle,

473
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:34,349
he meant for you to have it,

474
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:35,350
not sell it.

475
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:36,643
Well, I'm sure if he did,

476
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:38,645
he would have written
that down in a proper will.

477
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,980
He didn't.

478
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:42,440
You know, Henry was not
English the way you are.

479
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,985
He was a man of secrets,
a man of passion.

480
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,569
He didn't write things down.

481
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,822
You would take me
away from my vines?

482
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:51,324
My vines, Duflot.

483
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:53,284
I live in them,

484
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:54,536
I breathe in them.

485
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,413
They tear my hands.

486
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:58,999
Look, Francis, when
I sell the property,

487
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:02,085
I do intend to make you
a handsome settlement.

488
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:04,921
Do you know, monsieur,
what it is to love something

489
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:07,424
more than your own life?

490
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:10,635
To submit your days and nights
to the fickle will of nature?

491
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,679
I have only a few vintages left.

492
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:16,391
<i>Soon my body and spirit will
be defeated by the terroir. </i>

493
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:18,601
And you would dare come
here and take away

494
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,061
my last few chances of immortality?

495
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:23,231
Afraid so. Be in touch.

496
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:34,075
Leaving now.

497
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,493
Oh, good.

498
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:37,787
'Cause Sir Nigel has made
a special trip, Max.

499
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:39,789
-Is everything okay?
-Everything's fine.

500
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:42,459
Good. Oh, did you remember
to take photos for Charlie?

501
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,627
Yes.

502
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,420
-Damn it!

503
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:47,422
Idiot.

504
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:43,395
Let's see you then.

505
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,604
One... two...

506
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:46,314
...and go!

507
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:11,047
-Yes?
-Get in the car.

508
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:13,675
Get off my camera.

509
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:21,141
-Bollocks!

510
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,122
Oh, come on!
Where's the ladder?

511
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:47,500
Where are you, tosser?

512
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:34,047
-Hold on!

513
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:38,385
Come to Papa. Come to Papa.

514
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:49,187
Gemma, for God's sake, keep calling!

515
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:05,537
Hello.

516
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,664
Oh, no, don't worry about me.

517
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:09,165
I'm... I'm the pool man.

518
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:11,209
I do this every Thursday.

519
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,877
It's just routine maintenance.

520
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:18,425
It's been lovely chatting to you.

521
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,392
And, and you are
a spectacular vision.

522
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,104
But any chance for a rope
or a ladder?

523
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:34,357
Is that your little car?

524
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:36,568
Uh, yes, I'm the temporary custodian

525
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,528
of the lime green roller skate,

526
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,196
but it's a hired car; it's a rental.

527
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,072
It's not for sale. Sorry?

528
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:42,490
-Can you swim?
-Well, yes, but...

529
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:43,742
but not in a foot of cow shit.

530
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:50,206
Hello?

531
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:00,925
Will all passengers on Flight...

532
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:06,556
He's not on the flight.

533
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,183
Right, right.

534
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:11,478
Okay, roger that.

535
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:39,255
What is it, Major Lawrence,

536
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:43,385
that attracts you, personally,
to the desert?

537
00:34:44,928 --> 00:34:46,179
It's clean.

538
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:49,265
I like it because it's clean.

539
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:13,164
Great.

540
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,892
You better be in prison, Maxie.

541
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:34,394
Yes, just tell him I'm sorry.

542
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,187
There was nothing
I could do about it.

543
00:35:36,313 --> 00:35:38,481
Sorry's no good, Max.
He's gone.

544
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:39,983
Oh, shit.

545
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:43,403
Um, what time is the first
flight out in the morning?

546
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:45,822
Oh, there's no point
in rushing back, Max.

547
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:48,950
You know, the last thing
Sir Nigel did on his way out

548
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:51,953
-was to suspend you for a week.
-What?

549
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:54,748
What the f-does he expect me
to do for a week?

550
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:56,333
Take a holiday?

551
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,001
Christ, he didn't say that, did he?

552
00:35:58,126 --> 00:35:59,169
No, I just did.

553
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:00,962
Right, Gemma. Never say that.

554
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:02,297
If anybody calls,

555
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,341
do not say I'm on holiday.

556
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,884
All right?
That's worse than dying.

557
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,302
Now, look.

558
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:09,512
I'll be back in the office
in a couple of days.

559
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:10,639
-You just make sure
-Okay.

560
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:12,724
That every man jack
in there is ready.

561
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:14,851
Set it up so I can
trade in Kenny's name.

562
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,977
What?

563
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,146
Get him a clearance
at the highest level

564
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:19,814
on Sir Nigel's recommend.

565
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:20,899
Are you mad, Max?

566
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:22,067
Who cares? Just do it.

567
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:23,193
Don't tell anybody, all right?

568
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:25,695
Especially not that
little shit, Kenny.

569
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,530
Max, is there a problem?

570
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:29,532
No, I'm having a great time.

571
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:30,700
-You sure?
-Yes.

572
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:32,953
-You just be careful, okay? Okay. Ciao.
-Okay.

573
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:34,955
Bye.

574
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:33,805
-Oh, shit!

575
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:36,850
Shit! Scorpion! Scorpion!
Ludivine!

576
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:39,477
Scorpion!

577
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:42,397
-Oh! Drop it! Bloody hell!

578
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,774
Get that little bastard!

579
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:48,695
Of course.

580
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,071
Okay.

581
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:14,679
Fits very well; beautifully.

582
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,348
Max?

583
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:18,183
Are you back in Blighty?

584
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,559
On the contrary, chuckles.

585
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:23,229
I've decided to stick around
for a couple of days.

586
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,315
So it's true,
you are getting the sack.

587
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,233
No, I'm not getting
the sack, Charlie.

588
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,070
I'm just exploring my options,
with a view to realizing

589
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:32,155
the full potential
of my inheritance.

590
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:33,490
Well, speaking
of your inheritance,

591
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:34,908
how soon before we can view?

592
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,368
It's cosmetic stuff mostly, I'd say.

593
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:39,496
Surprising, actually,
how well it's been maintained.

594
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:40,872
Hmm. So you don't need

595
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,415
a contractor or anything like that?

596
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,501
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Just needs a...

597
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:47,212
a coat of paint
and a bit of a scrub.

598
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:48,421
Okay, you sure?

599
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:51,383
-No problem at all, Charlie.
-Good.

600
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:53,927
Charlie?

601
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:56,596
Charlie, can you hear me?

602
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:57,764
-Yes.

603
00:38:57,889 --> 00:38:58,848
Can you hear me now?

604
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:01,393
-Yes.
-Look, I wasn't joking before

605
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:03,603
about what I said
about the wine they make here.

606
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:07,857
It is not, I repeat,
not first-class.

607
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:10,735
-Will that affect our price?
-Well, how bad can it be?

608
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,570
Uh, well,
it gives you a blinding headache

609
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:13,905
-and it makes you angry.
-Ah.

610
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,741
I can't imagine the damage
a second sip might do.

611
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,576
Well, we'll just have to make sure

612
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,412
our buyers don't know
anything about wine.

613
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:21,830
We'll concentrate on the Americans.

614
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:26,084
Just make sure she's match-fit
in 72 hours.

615
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,669
72 hours.

616
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:29,087
Righto.

617
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:33,925
A Lamborghini tractor.

618
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,260
<i>Paintbrush...</i>

619
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:36,594
paintbrush, paintbrush.

620
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:42,517
Paintbrush!

621
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:57,866
You old bugger.

622
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,689
Duflot.

623
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:35,195
I was just about to use
that paintbrush.

624
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,613
It's my paintbrush.

625
00:40:36,696 --> 00:40:37,989
Gee whiz.

626
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:39,366
This is fun.

627
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,284
Tell you what,

628
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,995
I'll give you 20 euros
for your paintbrush.

629
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,246
-Hmm?
-No.

630
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:46,331
No?

631
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:47,832
Fifty.

632
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,460
I'll give you a hundred euros
for your paintbrush, Duflot.

633
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:52,212
I don't care.
What do you want?

634
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:57,342
When you sell, I stay vigneron.

635
00:40:57,425 --> 00:40:58,969
I keep my vines.

636
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:00,136
You want to stay with your vines?

637
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,471
-Mm-hmm.
-Fine.

638
00:41:01,554 --> 00:41:02,847
That means you...

639
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:05,225
must help me... fix the place up-

640
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,601
do the gardens,

641
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:09,187
paint the house,
clean the pool-and I,

642
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,272
if at all possible,
will attempt to convince

643
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:13,358
the new owners
of the worth and value

644
00:41:13,483 --> 00:41:14,859
of your services.

645
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,194
<i>D'accord?</i>

646
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:18,989
A Frenchman's hand

647
00:41:19,072 --> 00:41:21,324
is his word.

648
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,203
An Englishman's word is his bond.

649
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:27,372
<i>-Concord?
-Deal. </i>

650
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:29,916
Frog tosspot.

651
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,001
English prick.

652
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,271
No.

653
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:30,101
Awfully sorry.

654
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:34,272
Goal of the day.

655
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:53,667
Bat. Come on.

656
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:55,293
Here comes the ball!

657
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:58,505
Champion of the over-unh!

658
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:02,509
Let's play.

659
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:04,177
Come on.

660
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:09,432
All right, I'm 12-none out.

661
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:12,644
Okay.

662
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,318
It won't last one month.

663
00:43:20,443 --> 00:43:22,696
If things go
according to plan, Francis,

664
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,156
it will be somebody else's problem.

665
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:30,120
Monsieur Max!

666
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,288
Yes?

667
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:35,333
There is, um... a person

668
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,127
-at the door.
-A person?

669
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:38,336
A person.

670
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:43,967
<i>Bonjour. </i>

671
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:45,260
<i>Bonjour. </i>

672
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:51,141
The only country that issues
teeth like that is America.

673
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:52,392
Oh.

674
00:43:52,517 --> 00:43:53,560
You speak English.

675
00:43:53,685 --> 00:43:55,103
-Like a native.

676
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:56,855
I'm Christie Roberts.

677
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,857
I'm looking for Mr. Skinner.

678
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:01,484
You lucky devil, you found him.

679
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:03,028
Impossible.

680
00:44:03,153 --> 00:44:05,155
You're way too young.

681
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,575
You know, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

682
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,952
I meant too young to be my dad.

683
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,624
Henry Skinner is my father.

684
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,169
She has Henry's nose.

685
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:20,295
<i>Allez. Allez. </i>

686
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:25,008
Wow.

687
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:29,512
This your mum?

688
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:30,930
<i>In all her Flashdance glory. </i>

689
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:35,518
So, uh...

690
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:37,187
is he around?

691
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,357
Oh, bollocks.

692
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,524
Um...

693
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:46,237
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten your name.

694
00:44:46,363 --> 00:44:48,239
-It's Christie.
-Christie.

695
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:51,201
You see, Christie, um...

696
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:53,328
Henry...

697
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,123
He's dead, huh?

698
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:59,042
A month ago.

699
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:04,756
Um...

700
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,550
Cup of tea?

701
00:45:07,634 --> 00:45:09,386
Yes?

702
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:10,929
Madame Duflot.

703
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,015
Well, no, it's more
than a wrinkle, Max.

704
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,558
What if the girl
turns out to be legit?

705
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:16,726
Oh, come on, she turns up

706
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,561
a couple months after he parks it?

707
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:20,313
Far too sweet, Charlie;
I'm not buying it.

708
00:45:20,438 --> 00:45:21,606
You need some legal advice, mate,

709
00:45:21,731 --> 00:45:23,566
and you need it fast,
in case the little minx

710
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,360
screws up the whole deal.

711
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:26,736
Asking price?

712
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:28,363
Uh, it's seven and a half.

713
00:45:28,446 --> 00:45:29,864
Did you get that?

714
00:45:29,948 --> 00:45:32,951
Right.

715
00:45:36,663 --> 00:45:39,624
Christie, I'm just going
to pop into town.

716
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,793
Oh, no problem-
I booked a youth hostel,

717
00:45:41,918 --> 00:45:43,086
just in case the old man

718
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:44,546
-was schizo, you know?
-Oh, right.

719
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:46,589
Oh, you mind dropping me off?

720
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:50,260
I really got to get
out of these clothes.

721
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:52,345
Why don't you just get
out of your clothes here?

722
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,681
Got plenty of space, lots of room.

723
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:56,099
You can clean up, take a shower.

724
00:45:56,182 --> 00:45:58,184
-I'll be back in a jiff.
-You sure?

725
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,270
Absolutely, absolutely.

726
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:02,188
Madame Duflot?

727
00:46:02,314 --> 00:46:04,274
<i>Voila. </i>

728
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:10,613
In the French law, there is no difference between

729
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,533
legitimate and illegitimate
children when it comes

730
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:15,952
to their right to inherit.

731
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:17,412
That's bloody ridiculous.

732
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:19,080
She never even met Henry.

733
00:46:19,164 --> 00:46:20,790
She could very well be an impostor.

734
00:46:20,874 --> 00:46:23,209
That is precisely why
she would be required

735
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:24,628
to produce some form

736
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:26,463
of documentation.

737
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:27,922
Photo or even

738
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:30,508
correspondence-a love letter.

739
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:34,179
Yes, yes, yes, but what if I just...
sell the property

740
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:36,973
before she even makes her claim?

741
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:40,977
No; legally, she could
invalidate the sale

742
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:42,812
even after the transfer of title.

743
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:44,189
Bugger.

744
00:46:44,314 --> 00:46:45,857
My advice, Mr. Skinner,

745
00:46:45,982 --> 00:46:48,193
is to treat her
with the utmost respect.

746
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:49,986
Goes without saying.

747
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,530
And hope she'll be on her way.

748
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,324
...bugger off.

749
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:57,619
Don't let this... end in court.

750
00:47:16,763 --> 00:47:18,848
<i>Merci. </i>

751
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:32,487
Joan of Arc?

752
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:37,075
Oh, Jacques Cousteau.

753
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,868
You tried to drown me.

754
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:40,996
And you tried to run me
over with your little car.

755
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:43,290
What are you talking about,
I tried to run you over?

756
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:44,207
What sort of bollocks is that?

757
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,834
Down the road from La Siroque,

758
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:48,044
you were driving your
midget car on your phone.

759
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:50,839
<i>Bonjour. Bonjour. </i>

760
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:52,257
And I believe

761
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:54,342
had your head stuck
very far up your ass.

762
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:57,095
Look at the damage
you have caused me!

763
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,847
You tried to kill me,

764
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,598
I tried to kill you.

765
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:07,522
My God.

766
00:48:07,605 --> 00:48:09,691
She's fantastic.

767
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:17,073
Hey, Max.

768
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:18,742
Look at the view.

769
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:19,951
It's like Cézanne.

770
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:38,970
Oh, Tati. Psst.

771
00:48:44,142 --> 00:48:45,602
Francis...

772
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:48,897
in, uh, in town today,

773
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,483
I was, um,

774
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,984
I was passing by this restaurant...

775
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:54,778
Her name is Fanny Chenal.

776
00:48:56,363 --> 00:48:57,280
Right.

777
00:48:57,364 --> 00:48:58,448
Many times, I've seen

778
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:01,284
this same look on your uncle's face.

779
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:03,078
But you deserve credit.

780
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:04,621
Why is that?

781
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:06,957
You are now the town hero
for making her show

782
00:49:07,082 --> 00:49:08,625
her derriere.

783
00:49:13,004 --> 00:49:16,091
She, um...
She grew up around here, didn't she?

784
00:49:16,174 --> 00:49:17,467
Who?

785
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:19,970
Fanny Chenal.

786
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:22,138
I believe, yes.

787
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:24,182
She, um...

788
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:27,978
She otherwise spoken for?

789
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:30,271
She was once.

790
00:49:30,355 --> 00:49:33,066
A football player-for Lyon.

791
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:34,275
He was shit,

792
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,902
just like his left foot.

793
00:49:36,027 --> 00:49:38,280
He treated her very badly, you know.

794
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:41,157
Since then, it's rumored
that she will let no man

795
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:42,826
near her heart.

796
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:55,255
So she's alone, then.

797
00:49:56,548 --> 00:49:58,049
Who?

798
00:49:58,174 --> 00:49:59,801
Fanny Chenal.

799
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:00,844
Max,

800
00:50:00,927 --> 00:50:02,679
recall what Proust said:

801
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:04,306
"Leave pretty women

802
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:06,057
to men without imagination. "

803
00:50:06,224 --> 00:50:07,517
Duflot, I'm a banker.

804
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:10,895
I have no imagination.

805
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,814
Stop.

806
00:50:17,152 --> 00:50:18,653
Fred Perry.

807
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:22,490
Henri Lacoste.

808
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:37,422
Love-15.

809
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:43,637
15-all.

810
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:48,683
Yes!

811
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:53,271
No, no, out.

812
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:54,981
Cannot be serious!
That was in by a mile!

813
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,692
Ball. Ball!

814
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:02,197
Ah, good.

815
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,327
-Yeah! Hey!

816
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:10,747
Oh... oh, bollocks!

817
00:51:29,265 --> 00:51:30,558
My point.
