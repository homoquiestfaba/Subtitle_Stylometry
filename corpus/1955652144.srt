1072
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,720
Terrible shame...

1073
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,231
but this is the worst.

1074
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,833
You weren't ashamed last night.

1075
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,639
You weren't ashamed this afternoon.

1076
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,154
Ashamed of what?

1077
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,560
Of... of...

1078
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,233
Why should I be ashamed of that?

1079
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,951
You asked me... You asked me
what it was that I lacked,

1080
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,874

Since before Christmas.

1106
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,072
You know nothing about her.

1111

I shall continue to ask her.

1116

When exactly did you ask her?

1117
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,350
The moment I came of age. Yesterday.

1118
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,240
- (SOFTLY) My god, yesterday.
- What did she say?

1119
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,040
I thought she said yes, but...

1120
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,199
In fact, she meant no.

1121
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,796
Was this before or after
she read the document?

1122
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,951
Before. She read it the morning after.

1123
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,555
And wasted no time in driving over to see us.

1124
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,393
She said she didn't fully understand it.

1125
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,314
LOUISE: Well, she understood it
pretty damn well by the time she left.

1126

waiting for her carriage

1128
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,832
and my father said to her,

1129
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,994
"The marriage clause may
strike you as a little hard.

1130
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,152
You must remain a widow
if you want to keep your fortune."

1131
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,675
And what did she... What did she say?

1132
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,993
She just smiled and put on her gloves

1133
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,914
and said, "That suits me very well."

1134
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,117
PHILIP: That clause is to protect the estate.

1135
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,035
If she were my wife...
of course it wouldn't apply.

1136
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,954
No. No, you're wrong.

1137
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,874
If she marries you, or anyone else,

1138
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,998
then everything, the house,
everything, reverts to you.
