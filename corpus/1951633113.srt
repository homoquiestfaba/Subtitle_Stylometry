1
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,534
Kaaaate?

2
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:30,901
You ready?

3
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:34,868
Should I say, "This
chapter is so boring,

4
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:38,834
my begonia committed suicide
when I read it out loud,"

5
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:42,033
or, "Let's talk"?

6
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:43,667
I like the first one.

7
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,901
Yeah, me too.

8
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,534
Oh, God, we're never
gonna make it.

9
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,367
So we're just gonna get
the 6 to Grand Central?

10
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:51,234
Well, I thought that
we would take the N here

11
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:52,234
and then transfer.

12
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,901
Heh.
Right.

13
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,100
Ta-da!

14
00:00:58,135 --> 00:00:59,968
Wow!
Yeah.

15
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,701
I mean, I know it's
little and it's dark

16
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,767
and the hallways
smell like cabbage...

17
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:05,334
And it's in Brooklyn.

18
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,767
But it's mine!

19
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:08,567
There's--
there's no roommate,

20
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,200
there's no cigarette butts
in the coffee cups,

21
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:13,701
no-- no toenails
in the sink.

22
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,334
Ew!

23
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,300
You're glowing.

24
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm happy.

25
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:21,701
No, I mean it.
You got this weird glow.

26
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,701
So, whaddaya think?

27
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,634
Oh! And, uh, they
fixed up the kitchen.

28
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,567
What are you gonna do
with a kitchen?

29
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:32,033
I'm cooking.
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,467
Friday, as a matter
of fact, for Matt.

31
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:36,467
It's a special meal.

32
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:37,968
What's special?

33
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:40,234
Oh, it's mine,
it's mine!

34
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,100
It's all mine!
Thanks for coming!

35
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:51,834
Matt? Whaddaya think?

36
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,367
Forget the packing boxes

37
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:55,434
and I'm gonna get
some more furniture.

38
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:58,133
Well, I have a bed.

39
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,067
And just because I never cook
doesn't mean I can't.

40
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:04,234
It just means it's a pain
to cook for one person.

41
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,300
Mmm. Mmm.

42
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,934
Matt?

43
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:13,934
Well, I hope you like
what I'm making.

44
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,868
It's a special meal because
it's a very special night.

45
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:22,767
I said, it's a special meal
because it's a special night.

46
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,100
I have a present for you.

47
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,934
I can't do it.

48
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,400
Of course
the watering schedules

49
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:15,367
could be inserted
into the paragraph.

50
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:19,300
I'm not suggesting it's
a physical impossibility.

51
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:20,901
Esthetically,
it's a train wreck,

52
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,434
but it can be done.

53
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,234
You could also decide
to use italics

54
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,968
if you want to complete
the destruction.

55
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,934
What's wrong?

56
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:35,434
It's something
I said, isn't it?

57
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:37,901
My wicked tongue.

58
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:39,234
No.

59
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,534
Alright, mea culpa.

60
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,033
I wanted a different editor;
I admit it.

61
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,968
But let me come right out
and say you've done

62
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:48,200
an excellent job...
for a young woman.

63
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:51,467
Thanks.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,868
"Dear Kate,
I honestly did think

65
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:23,467
"it could work between us

66
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:27,367
"and it is completely
my fault that it couldn't.

67
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:30,767
"You did nothing wrong
except ask me to lunch.

68
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,934
"If you've got
the heart to read this,

69
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:38,968
"it will explain everything
better than I could.

70
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,868
"Be warned, though.

71
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:44,534
"There are parts that will be
hard to get through.

72
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,067
"'Sorry' is too weak a word.

73
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,634
Matt."

74
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,000
Who?

75
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:17,300
Eighteen months ago.

76
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,400
"Dear Nicholas...

77
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:25,567
"as I write the first
entry in this diary,

78
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:30,734
you were not yet born,
but I know you will be..."

79
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,734
So, I've decided
to keep a record

80
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,100
of your childhood
for you to look back on

81
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,501
when you grow up.

82
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:40,200
It's important to know
where you came from, Nicky.

83
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,934
Gives you roots.

84
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:46,267
So I'm gonna begin
before the beginning,

85
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,467
before I even met
your father.

86
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:50,200
I was still a doctor
in Boston.

87
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:53,300
Dr. Brunik,
report to the neuro ICU.

88
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,300
Suzanne.

89
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,033
Michael.

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,434
See you
at the house, okay?

91
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:00,634
You got it.

92
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,167
Ugh.

93
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,534
Are you alright, miss?
I'm a doctor.

94
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,634
I think I'm...

95
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,100
gonna have
a heart attack.

96
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,067
Oh, my God!

97
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm only 33.

98
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,467
Calm, Suzanne.

99
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:02,701
Yes, calm.

100
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,868
You had a double bypass,
not botox.

101
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:07,601
But I'm only 33, Phil.

102
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,434
With a family history
of heart disease.

103
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:14,200
Which doesn't seem
to be here in your record.

104
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,734
Hmm.

105
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,434
I forgot.

106
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,667
Uh-huh.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,300
Well, I can tell you
that at auction

108
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:26,334
a piece of depression glass
in this condition--

109
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,534
You're late again.

110
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,167
Michael, I am so bored.

111
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,767
Will you please take me
out to dinner?

112
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:35,200
Please, please, please?

113
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,033
I want something fat
and I want something greasy

114
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,834
and I want...

115
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,467
Uh-oh.

116
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:47,801
Suzanne, how long have
we been seeing each other?

117
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,968
Six months?

118
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,234
And did you consider our
relationship a serious one?

119
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,234
Don't use the professor voice,
Michael, please.

120
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,234
It drives me insane.

121
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,634
Fine, regular voice.

122
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,234
Why the hell
didn't you tell me
you had a heart problem?

123
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,534
God, I can't--

124
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:01,901
Just one last time.

125
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,467
There was no problem.

126
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,601
There was a history.

127
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:10,434
Well, there was history
of measles too, Michael.

128
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,067
And you put that
in your medical record.

129
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,934
I took a look at your workup,
Suzanne; it isn't good.

130
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:18,801
There's damage
to your heart.

131
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,534
It isn't life-threatening,
but it is limiting.

132
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,601
And one of the limitations--
now I consulted
with cardio on this,

133
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,901
so don't shoot
the messenger--

134
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,133
Just...
Okay.

135
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm afraid we've come
to the conclusion

136
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:32,334
that a pregnancy would pose
a real risk to your health.

137
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:38,868
You know I want
children, Suzanne.

138
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:40,367
You know it's one
of the most important--

139
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:42,067
I know.

140
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,934
If you'd just told me.

141
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,634
Wait a minute.

142
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,167
Wait, let me--
let me get this straight.

143
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:52,934
Are you saying that
because my family

144
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,334
has a history of heart disease,
that I don't have

145
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,601
the right to--
to fall in love?

146
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,167
Or-- or to have a relationship
or to get married?

147
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,601
I mean,
is this what you're--

148
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,701
is this what
you're saying, Michael?

149
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,801
Huh?

150
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,234
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,200
Bastard.

152
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,300
Did you read
the last page?

153
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,367
What?

154
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,567
No.

155
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,300
But you're
going to, right?

156
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:33,701
Why should I?

157
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:36,367
Maybe Michael dies
at the end or something.
I don't know.

158
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:39,434
Well, I know.

159
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,467
See, Matt's
the rebound guy.

160
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:44,934
Suzanne found him
and they're together right now

161
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:47,534
living happily ever after.

162
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:50,767
And that's all
I need to know.

163
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,334
What did you have?

164
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:57,901
Half of yours.

165
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:28,167
Weak. Weak.

166
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,667
He walked out with his art

167
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:37,300
and his antiques...
and my whole life.

168
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:38,868
I had nothing left.

169
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:42,467
No lover, no child,
no plans.

170
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,801
I needed a change, Nicky.

171
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:49,701
Not just a small change;
a sea change.

172
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,133
Until I began college,
I had spent every summer

173
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,734
on Martha's Vineyard.

174
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,234
And I remembered
it was the last

175
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,033
best place in the world.

176
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,167
So, with all of my savings,
I bought the practice

177
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:16,334
of a retiring GP
who was headed back to Boston.

178
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:22,033
We were switching lives.

179
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,868
I told him I felt that
I'd gotten the better deal.

180
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:58,334
And when I stood there
in that house that was mine,

181
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,968
everything snapped
into place.

182
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,934
I knew that I had made
the right decision.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,801
By some extraordinary
twist of luck,

184
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,601
I had found
my perfect place.

185
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,300
You the doc?

186
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:27,601
Uh, yeah.
Something wrong?

187
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:30,200
No, I'm from
across the road.
Oh.

188
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:33,501
Yeah. I said to Carl,
my husband Carl,

189
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,200
I said, somebody
went and did it.

190
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,467
Couldn't be a local.

191
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,434
No, no, I'm from Boston--

192
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,100
Then he said it's a doc
from the city.

193
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,434
And I said, well,
that's a blessing,

194
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,801
'cause when we lost
old Doc MacLaren,

195
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,901
I thought we were just
outta luck down here.

196
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:46,467
And me with two
little ones.

197
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:47,567
You know, I have
a family practice--

198
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:48,901
And then Carl says,
does he know

199
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,534
what she's getting
herself into?

200
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,534
And I said, well,
I don't expect old Doc

201
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,033
give her the grand tour.

202
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,200
He could barely walk,
ya know?

203
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:56,901
He had this thing
with his hip?

204
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:57,934
You got a minute?

205
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,133
Um...

206
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,968
Take a whiff.

207
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:07,000
Think it's low tide,
don't ya?

208
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,467
Septic tank.

209
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,934
Oh, well,
that's not good.

210
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:17,033
Don't worry; there's six
more layers under that.

211
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,734
Watch.

212
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,000
But hey,
I'm the glass-half-empty girl,

213
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,400
ya know?

214
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,534
It's a beautiful place.

215
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,901
Well, it could be.

216
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,367
Anyway, we're happy
to have you here.

217
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,300
Welcome to the Vineyard.
I'm Melanie Boom.

218
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:39,601
Oh, Suzanne--
Bedford, yeah.

219
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:40,801
And don't worry
about a thing.

220
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,701
I know this great
handyman-painter type.

221
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,100
Better than Picasso.

222
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,534
I'll get him out here,
no problem.

223
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,868
Hello?

224
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,501
Hello?

225
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:17,968
Hell--

226
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:20,767
Uh...

227
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:22,434
Picasso?

228
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:23,834
You've been talkin'
to Melanie.

229
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,534
Yeah.

230
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:26,701
You-- you started already?

231
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,701
Yeah. You owe me
140 bucks so far.

232
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:32,133
I'm just kiddin'.

233
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,901
I'm checkin',
makin' some notes.

234
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,667
I'll be right down.

235
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,367
Did Melanie, uh,
show you around?

236
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:48,601
Yes, she-- she gave me
the grand tour.

237
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:49,767
She tell you
about the roof?

238
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:52,501
No.
Uh, the shingles?

239
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,501
No.
The, um...

240
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,901
Don't worry.

241
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:00,367
Yeah, that's--
that's what Melanie said.

242
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,300
I'll have it done
by the millennium.

243
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,934
But the millennium
was two years ago.

244
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,300
The next millennium.

245
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:06,601
Oh.

246
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,300
Do you know your way
around the island?

247
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,634
I could, uh,
show you around sometime.

248
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,400
Oh, um...

249
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:16,734
No, I, uh...

250
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,400
Or I could just
fix your house and shut up.

251
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:20,601
No, it's-- it's--

252
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:23,133
It's not that I don't--
It--

253
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
It's just a bad time.

254
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:29,634
No problem.

255
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,834
Ah...

256
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,033
The doctor in, Miss?

257
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,667
Uh, yeah,
I'm the doctor.

258
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:02,734
Ah...
Uh...

259
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,467
Do I need
an appointment?

260
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,100
I, uh, think
I can squeeze you in.

261
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:12,400
Why don't you
have a seat?

262
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,534
So what seems
to be the problem?

263
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,734
What ain't?
Okay.

264
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:21,300
I had a heart attack.

265
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:23,033
You did? When?

266
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:24,367
Last week.

267
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,567
You had a heart attack
last week?

268
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:28,767
It sure felt like one.

269
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:30,601
Well, did you see
a doctor?

270
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:32,300
Seein' one now.

271
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:34,901
Ah, okay.

272
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,234
Do you have any
other complaints, Mr., uh...

273
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,400
Earl'll do.

274
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:39,801
Earl.

275
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:42,567
Well, since you're askin',
I got the gout.

276
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:45,234
Pretty sore.
Swelled up foot.

277
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,968
How'd you get your shoe on?

278
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,234
Oh, it wasn't easy.

279
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,534
Alright, is there
anything else?

280
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:54,100
I got a list.

281
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Uh...

282
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,501
Excuse me.
Sorry.

283
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,067
Hi.

284
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,701
Come on over.

285
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,734
I write.

286
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,567
Pardon?

287
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:57,501
Oh, you got that look.

288
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,100
What look?

289
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,601
Why is he
a house painter?

290
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,801
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

291
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:06,868
Well, I'll tell ya
if you wanna know.

292
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:07,868
Okay.

293
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,634
I'm an open book.

294
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:10,834
Okay.

295
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,934
Okay, if you're gonna
beat it outta me...

296
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,868
I went to work
at my old man's company

297
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,167
after I graduated
from Brown.

298
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,300
My father was proud of me,
which was important, I guess.

299
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,167
So I worked there
through most of my 20's,

300
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:28,667
and then my father
passed away,

301
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,467
and I realized
that I had nobody left

302
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:36,133
to prove myself to,
and that... I hated it.

303
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:39,501
And I drank too much
and I did too many drugs

304
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,567
and hated the city and...

305
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:44,400
I knew I had to make
a sea change.

306
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,901
Thank you.

307
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:54,100
See, the thing is,
at Brown I wrote.

308
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,133
And I had this one
great professor

309
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:59,567
who told me that
I'd be a writer.

310
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:03,033
He had, uh--
he had faith in me.

311
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,167
So I went back to him
and I asked,

312
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:07,701
"Is this stupid?"

313
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:12,434
And he said,
"It's never stupid
to do what you want."

314
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,901
Which I realize now
is a crock.

315
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,300
But at the time,
it's what I wanted to hear.

316
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,434
So, um, I moved back
to the only place

317
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,234
that I ever loved
and I began.

318
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:24,234
That was about
eight years ago and...

319
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,868
so far, I've sold...

320
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:31,367
almost one story.

321
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:35,234
The handyman thing
is how I support myself.

322
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:39,067
I write.
I write every single day.

323
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:41,334
Doesn't matter
if anyone reads it

324
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,033
or doesn't read it.

325
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:46,033
I write.

326
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:48,534
Only thing
I'm serious about.

327
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:56,467
I didn't know doctors
ate this kind of food.

328
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:59,901
A Sam's clamburger?

329
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:03,934
Ah, well, bad days,
small comfort.

330
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,434
Here you go, Matt.
Thank you.

331
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:07,901
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to--

332
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:12,000
No, I'm runnin' the bill up
on this new lady in town.

333
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:17,968
So, if your last name
is Picasso,

334
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:20,367
what's your first name?

335
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:22,267
Matthew.

336
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:26,467
Matthew "Picasso" Harrelson.

337
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,434
Welcome to the Vineyard.

338
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:29,901
Thank you.

339
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:32,100
Oh, God.

340
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,133
Oh, God, that's the--

341
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,734
She made it up!
That's not Matt at all!

342
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,000
That's not him.

343
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:49,033
Mr. Harrelson, hi.
I'm Kate Wilkes.

344
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:52,033
It's so good
to finally meet you.

345
00:21:52,068 --> 00:21:55,200
Well, please come in.
Sit down.

346
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:57,968
Um, here.

347
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,901
Can I first say that...

348
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,501
I love your stories,
especially the ones

349
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,501
that you've written
most recently.

350
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,133
They show a dramatic
improvement.

351
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:11,133
Um, they're tougher,
more honestly emotional.

352
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:13,100
They made me cry.

353
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,667
Um...

354
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,334
Well, as you know,
ten stories

355
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,868
have been chosen
for your book.

356
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:27,167
Might I suggest that
we meet once a week

357
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:31,133
for the next ten weeks
and tackle one story at a time.

358
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,067
How does that sound?

359
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,501
That's fine.

360
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,234
Fine. Good.

361
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:38,634
So, uh, if this
is a good time,

362
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:41,634
then, why, let's say,
uh, every Friday at noon.

363
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,367
Yes.

364
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:53,167
Okay.

365
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:55,267
Why don't we get
to work, then?

366
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,167
Alright, Doc.

367
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:06,934
What was your secret?

368
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,067
What did you do for him?

369
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Hey.
Hey.

370
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:23,467
Ugh.

371
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,767
Long day?

372
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:27,133
No, it was a good day.

373
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:29,334
Finally have
some patients.

374
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:31,067
And that's not
counting Earl.

375
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:33,868
Like who?

376
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:35,601
Oh, I can't tell you that.

377
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:37,834
That's doctor-client
confidentiality.

378
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:42,033
Well, I saw Doris Latham
get rolled in.

379
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,334
She's dead.
Did you figure that out?

380
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,701
Oh, no.
She's only 92.

381
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:48,534
Who else?

382
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,434
I can't.

383
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:55,567
Oh, what could happen
if you told me?

384
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,133
Oh, jeez!
Oh!

385
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,334
Whoa.
Here.

386
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,968
I got it.
That's good.

387
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,267
I got it.
Alright.

388
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:11,834
Got it?
Yeah.

389
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,167
Ho.

390
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,634
I-- I was just gonna
fix some dinner.

391
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,601
You wanna stay?

392
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:27,300
I'd love to.

393
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:36,300
Voila!

394
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:37,634
This is it?

395
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,067
Oh, come on,
don't insult
the Suzanne.

396
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:44,467
Oh, dear.

397
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:45,534
Okay.
Madam.

398
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,467
Thank you.

399
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:50,868
Thank you.

400
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:53,200
You're welcome.

401
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,133
Watch your head.

402
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:56,133
Ready?

403
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:57,567
Does it even run?

404
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:59,734
On and off.

405
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,701
Ha ha!

406
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:02,834
Oh.

407
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,434
Like to take the helm?

408
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:08,267
Should I?

409
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:10,133
Come on.
Okay.

410
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:13,467
Just steering, right?

411
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:16,167
I don't have to
do anything fancy?

412
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:18,501
I just hold on
to this thing.

413
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:20,434
Okay.
Yes.

414
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:22,300
Ready?
Okay, yes.

415
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:23,534
Okay.

416
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:52,868
Hi.

417
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:55,100
Hey.
Matt.

418
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,367
Hey, hold on a minute.

419
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,167
Hey, Doc.

420
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,534
What?

421
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:19,701
Dance?

422
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:21,734
No...

423
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,200
It's not really
a dancing place,

424
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:26,868
I don't think.

425
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:48,200
Okay, okay,
stop, stop, stop.

426
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,033
What?

427
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,501
What's wrong?

428
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,868
Nothing.

429
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,000
Hi.

430
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:00,734
You look, uh--

431
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,734
So, um,
you know what?

432
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:19,868
I didn't have any
breakfast this morning.

433
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:21,634
I'm starving.

434
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:22,767
Sorry?

435
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,968
No, I mean that
we could, uh--

436
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:28,567
we could go out
to lunch now,
on the company.

437
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,901
And, you know, it would,
uh, we-- we would work there.

438
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,334
It'd be like a--

439
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,467
a working lunch,
but, um--

440
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:38,767
Mmm.

441
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,667
Okay.

442
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:46,133
Okay.

443
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:51,467
Thank you.

444
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:54,968
It's where we take
our most important clients.

445
00:29:55,003 --> 00:30:00,133
Yeah, it's a little fancy,
but, uh, good food.

446
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:02,767
The, um-- They have
a fish special every day

447
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,100
that's not on the menu.

448
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,167
You like fish?

449
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:07,067
No.

450
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:08,968
No? I thought, um--

451
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:12,434
Isn't fishing,
like, a big deal
on Martha's Vineyard?

452
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,767
Yes, it is.

453
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,067
Yeah!
With the whaling and--

454
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:17,501
That's Nantucket.

455
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:20,167
Right, 'cause that's
the main--

456
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:25,968
You know, they make guacamole
right at the table.

457
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:27,033
Really?

458
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,167
Yeah. They, uh,
bring over the avocados

459
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,000
and then they mush 'em up,
and, um, you know,

460
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:36,167
they just put the rest
of the stuff in, and, um...

461
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,767
Well--

462
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,267
Then they light it.

463
00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:45,667
Yeah. It's their
specialty here.

464
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,501
Flaming guacamole.

465
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:58,434
Personally, I like
the fish better.

466
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:01,868
Well, it's a small town
about 50 miles

467
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,434
outside of Raleigh.

468
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:04,567
Tobaccy country.

469
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:07,234
It's got one main road,
one school.

470
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:09,934
Did you smoke?
Hmm?

471
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,334
Tobaccy country.

472
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,534
Oh.

473
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:16,667
Yeah, well...
everybody smoked.

474
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:20,801
Um, my first boyfriend
rolled a homemade for me,

475
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:22,667
which he could do
with one hand

476
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,100
by the time he was 11.

477
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:26,701
He dared me to inhale.

478
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:28,767
I passed out cold,

479
00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:31,400
right into a patch
of poison sumac.

480
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:34,701
Oh, boy.

481
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:37,334
I came up with sores
that were so bad,

482
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:42,334
I truly believed that I had
a visitation from the Lord.

483
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,100
No, but I like it here.

484
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:50,234
Well, I do wish that my roommate
would get a job in Alaska.

485
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,200
And I wish that
the crazy guy

486
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:55,767
would stop following me
to work every day.

487
00:31:55,802 --> 00:31:58,434
But we had a crazy guy
in Bethel, too.

488
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:00,901
Delbert O'Dell.

489
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:04,601
He would always hang out
in front of the Ben Franklin.

490
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,167
But it was different,
because when I was younger,

491
00:32:07,202 --> 00:32:09,767
I could say, "Hey, Del,
it's time for you
to go home now,"

492
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:13,033
and I knew that he wasn't
gonna rape me or--

493
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:15,667
Del O'Dell?
Yeah.

494
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:18,801
Older brother of Mel.

495
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:23,000
But what about you?
I mean, what, uh--

496
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:24,968
When did you have
your first cigarette?

497
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:29,300
And do you have
a crazy guy in your town?

498
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:32,534
Are those
your nicest shoes?

499
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,801
Uh, are you, um...

500
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:38,234
married?

501
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,734
No.

502
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:50,667
Okay. Um...

503
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:55,133
So, uh,
on page 24...
24?

504
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:58,434
Yeah, small typo.

505
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:01,467
What did you give me?

506
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:03,968
Sleepy Time?

507
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:06,400
You give me Sleepy Time
at 10:00 in the morning?

508
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:09,434
Listen--
You know who's coming in
today, Bernard Faber.

509
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,033
Laurie--
The Amphibians Make
Good Pets guy.

510
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:13,267
Laurie...
I'm gonna be asleep--

511
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:15,934
Shut up!

512
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,067
I think...

513
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,200
I think it's serious.

514
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,501
What, you mean with the--

515
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:28,467
Okay.

516
00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:30,334
No, it's getting serious.
Is that better?

517
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:31,434
No, I didn't mean--

518
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,567
Okay, okay.

519
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:37,200
It's moving
in the direction
of serious.

520
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,667
Ah...
Ah...

521
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:44,734
It's serious.

522
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,133
I think he's gonna
ask me, ya know?

523
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:50,634
Oh, I know.

524
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:51,968
You know?

525
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:53,734
How would you know?

526
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,901
Alright, now take
a deep breath, okay?

527
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,267
It's an island.

528
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,534
Again.

529
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:01,067
Okay.

530
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:02,267
Well, that's
a good thing, right?

531
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:03,567
Good thing?

532
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:06,634
The best thing that
ever happened to me.

533
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,667
There's just this one...

534
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:11,934
Well.

535
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,834
Kid, I think
you're gonna live.

536
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,767
So who came in today?

537
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:22,367
Uh, Earl was in.

538
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:23,501
Earl.

539
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:24,834
What did he have
this time?

540
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:29,634
He had left-side
weakness, a lumbago.

541
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,200
Lumbago?
Mm-hmm.

542
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,000
I want
a lumbago.
No.

543
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:35,434
I can't clean your
septic system today,
Mr. Schwartz.

544
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,100
My lumbago
is acting up.

545
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:39,734
Listen, Matt, I...

546
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:42,400
What?

547
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,067
You know, you know
that I was, uh--

548
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:47,901
I lived in Boston
for six years, right?

549
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,000
You goin' back?

550
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,601
No, no.

551
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:54,133
No, not a chance
in hell.

552
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,601
I just-- There were
a lot of reasons

553
00:34:55,636 --> 00:35:00,868
that I had to leave there,
and one of the reasons--

554
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:02,968
You-- you had
a heart attack

555
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:04,467
and then your
boyfriend left you.
No, no.

556
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,167
Yeah, but--
And you wanted
a change, I know.

557
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:09,901
Yeah, but, Matt,
you don't know
why he left me.

558
00:35:09,936 --> 00:35:13,133
Alright? Michael left me
because he wanted to have...

559
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:14,634
because he wanted
to have children.

560
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:17,567
And because
of my heart disease,

561
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:20,701
pregnancy for me
is a risk.

562
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,534
And I-- I know
I should've
told you that,

563
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:24,601
and I didn't tell you that
because I was afraid to

564
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:27,033
and-- and I'm sorry.

565
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,133
How much of a risk?

566
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:32,801
Enough.

567
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,868
Okay.

568
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,901
Then that's just
the way it is.

569
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:42,334
You don't care?

570
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:47,367
You don't want kids?

571
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:50,000
Come on, Mr. Open Book,
you told me yourself

572
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:51,667
that the only thing
that you want in this life

573
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:52,667
is to have a family.

574
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:54,200
I want you.
I want you more.

575
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:58,267
And don't know
if I can give you--
I want you more.

576
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:01,834
I want you more.

577
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,234
So is that
your only problem?

578
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:09,601
Yeah, I guess
just, uh--

579
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:12,601
- one little thing.

580
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:17,334
Okay.
Okay.

581
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:21,434
What's that?

582
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,868
It's a rock.

583
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:27,801
I don't think
it's a rock.

584
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,968
No, it's a rock.
Look, it's a rock.

585
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,767
Look.

586
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,701
You're right;
it is a rock.

587
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:47,267
Will you marry me?

588
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,501
Yes.

589
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,033
Careful, I might
have a heart attack!

590
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,200
This is Vineyard Home Services.

591
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:21,767
Matt isn't here right now.

592
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:23,834
If you leave a message,
he'll get back to you

593
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,033
as soon as he can, thanks.

594
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,033
I just--

595
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:31,767
I just wanted to say...

596
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:33,968
I'm reading it.

597
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:07,667
Okay, alright,
that wasn't easy.

598
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,667
Ready?
Put me down.

599
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,367
Oh, whoa!

600
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,267
Uh.

601
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,267
What does that say?

602
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:32,734
"Paramada junkie?"

603
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,834
Oh, well, um...
I thought that the--

604
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,434
Oh, "paragraph."

605
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:38,968
Right.

606
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:41,767
Uh, it's just
a bit--
Chunky.

607
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,200
Well, long.

608
00:38:43,235 --> 00:38:44,767
Um, you can cut it...

609
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:48,534
from here...

610
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:52,534
all the way to here.

611
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,634
Ouch.

612
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:57,667
What if we just
cut it to, uh, there?

613
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:02,300
Yeah, uh,
it could work.

614
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:05,334
I suppose.

615
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:07,667
I'll try.

616
00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:09,767
Good.

617
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:11,801
Good. That's-- that's--
that's good.

618
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:19,734
In here!

619
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:23,767
Oh...

620
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:24,968
It's beautiful.

621
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:27,100
Not bad.

622
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:29,000
My little corner.

623
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,033
I love it.

624
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,100
Yeah, so I could waste
my time as usual,

625
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:35,767
but, uh, at least
I got a great view doing it.

626
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:37,501
You're not wasting your time.

627
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:44,267
Seven years of rejections.

628
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,868
"Thank you very much
for your submission."

629
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:50,601
"We're lying when
we say we liked it.

630
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:53,067
"Actually, we didn't
like it at all

631
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:54,801
"and we think you should
get a real job

632
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:57,734
and stop wasting your time."

633
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,200
No.
Yes.

634
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:00,868
I feel guilty about it.

635
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:02,000
I hadn't felt guilty
about anything

636
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,667
since I left
my father's business.

637
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,501
Look at me.

638
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm-- I'm living
in your house.

639
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:08,834
We could have
lived in yours.

640
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:11,634
Oh, yeah, my room
above Sulucy's Hair and Nails?

641
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,367
That would have been ideal.

642
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:20,767
I can't support you...

643
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:22,200
in any kind of style.

644
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,534
Wait a minute.

645
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:26,133
What is it, 1954?

646
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:27,968
I can support myself
just fine, thanks.

647
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:30,334
No, I don't--
I don't mean--

648
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,534
I'm not contributing.

649
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:33,734
And that bothers me.

650
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,133
And if you want me
to stop,

651
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,767
if you want me
to grow the hell up

652
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,634
and do something
with my life,

653
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,100
just say the word.

654
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:48,467
Thanks.

655
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:52,701
Matt... if I wanted
some corporate suit type,

656
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,133
I would've stayed
in Boston

657
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:56,567
and hung out
at singles bars.

658
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:57,834
Really?

659
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:00,734
No.

660
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:03,334
I don't want you
to change.

661
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,400
You're my van Gogh;
you're not--

662
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,167
you're not
my Donald Trump.

663
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:12,300
And another thing,
my sweet, sweet man,

664
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:15,367
I do not want you
to grow the hell up.

665
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:18,501
I'll try not to.

666
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:22,767
Page 37, para 2,

667
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:27,200
I think this reveal
happens too early.

668
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,000
I could be wrong.

669
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:35,000
No.

670
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:38,100
Where would you
move it to?

671
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:39,367
What?

672
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:41,868
I said, uh, where
would you move it to?

673
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:50,400
I was thinkin' about
the-- the end here.

674
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:57,100
Um, maybe,
uh, page 40?

675
00:41:57,135 --> 00:42:00,767
Before Norman leaves?

676
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:04,100
It's only a suggestion.

677
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:06,968
If you don't want to...

678
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:11,267
I don't.
I don't want to.

679
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,968
Mmm.

680
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:04,968
Are you alright?

681
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,567
Yeah, sure.

682
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:11,067
Good.

683
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:14,634
You just look...

684
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:17,300
It doesn't
make you happy?

685
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,033
What?

686
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:22,367
What? Sex.

687
00:43:22,402 --> 00:43:24,701
Oh, that.

688
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,367
Do you have
an ethical problem?

689
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:30,400
You know, me being
your editor,

690
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:31,467
that kind of thing?
No.

691
00:43:31,502 --> 00:43:33,234
Because it won't
affect our work.

692
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:34,834
I know.
I mean, they're two
separate things.

693
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:36,067
I know.
I'm a professional.

694
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:37,334
Kate...

695
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:41,367
I like the sex.

696
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:43,801
I like you.

697
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:46,200
Everything's fine, okay?

698
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:53,701
Oh, I'm so sorry.

699
00:43:53,736 --> 00:43:56,634
I don't nag.

700
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:59,701
Usually.

701
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:03,667
I just, um...

702
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:06,100
You don't talk
about your life.

703
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:08,367
At all.

704
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:11,734
And so, I think...

705
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:13,767
I think something
happened to you

706
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:18,334
and maybe if you
told me about it--

707
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,667
You know, I mean,
I can-- I can shut up.

708
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:26,133
But I can listen, really.
Um, I'm a very good...

709
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:29,334
listener.

710
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:48,968
Hey!

711
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:51,167
Suzanne?

712
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:52,934
You okay?

713
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,934
Yeah, honey, it's--
it's nothing.

714
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,667
Nothing?

715
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:00,868
There's all
those sick people

716
00:45:00,903 --> 00:45:03,567
you touch every day
and I don't like it.

717
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,434
Suzanne?

718
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:10,601
Well, that's what
doctors do, sweetie,

719
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:12,067
they treat sick people.

720
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:14,400
Yeah, well,
it's an outrage.

721
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:15,534
You stay in bed today.

722
00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:17,100
You let Earl
torture someone else.

723
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:19,467
No, sweetie.
Look, I finally have
a full waiting room.

724
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:21,434
Just let me go
to work, alright?

725
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,567
Well, then, you should
eat something.

726
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:23,567
Oh, yeah, right.

727
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:24,734
I could fry you
some eggs...

728
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:26,234
in butter.

729
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,400
I can fry 'em up
in bacon fat for ya.
That-- that'll be--

730
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,767
Yeah, hysterical.

731
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:44,100
Sorry, I got home
too late to cook.

732
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:46,000
You don't cook.

733
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,100
Okay, so,
everybody, dig in.

734
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:50,033
Uh, pan fried noodles,
they're my favorite.

735
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:51,234
I'm on low-carbs.

736
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:52,667
Oh.

737
00:45:52,702 --> 00:45:54,934
I'll take the noodles.

738
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:56,267
Mmm.

739
00:45:56,302 --> 00:45:59,701
So, uh, it's great
that we could all do this.

740
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:02,734
Um, Laurie has read
your stories too.

741
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:04,901
I love the one about
the country doctor.

742
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:05,901
Thank you.

743
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:07,133
Is it from life?

744
00:46:07,168 --> 00:46:08,467
Someone I knew.

745
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:09,467
Where?

746
00:46:09,502 --> 00:46:11,033
Martha's Vineyard.

747
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,868
You know he's from
Martha's Vineyard, Laurie.

748
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, I love the Vineyard.
What do you do there?

749
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:17,133
He's a writer, Stephen.

750
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:18,167
No, I mean for a livin'.

751
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:20,767
I should put
some music on.

752
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:22,567
Are you a native
of the Vineyard?

753
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:23,801
No.

754
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:24,968
It's wall-to-wall
celebrities there.

755
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,467
Tea? Everybody want tea?

756
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:28,367
I saw Carly Simon there once.

757
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,801
Do you know her?
No.

758
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:33,200
She has a big mouth.
Like, a huge mouth.

759
00:46:33,235 --> 00:46:34,200
Where are you from then?

760
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:36,334
Laurie!
Uh, can you
help me, please?

761
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:37,767
Do you know any celebrities?

762
00:46:37,802 --> 00:46:40,267
Put water in a kettle
and turn it on high.

763
00:46:40,302 --> 00:46:42,567
Matt, do you know
any celebrities?

764
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:46,834
I installed a toilet
for Walter Cronkite once.

765
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,267
No kidding.

766
00:46:53,302 --> 00:46:54,667
You know Walter Cronkite.

767
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:55,634
Huh.

768
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:02,634
What?

769
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,200
You told me that you
couldn't get pregnant.

770
00:47:05,235 --> 00:47:07,467
No, I told you that there
might be some risks--

771
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:09,934
You never said "might be."
You said "would be."

772
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,501
Oh, Matt.
You said there would be.

773
00:47:12,536 --> 00:47:14,467
Look, no one
really knows.

774
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:16,634
I mean, I could have
the easiest pregnancy
in the world

775
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:18,434
or I could have
some complications.

776
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,167
That makes me feel
a lot better.

777
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,334
Honey... we're gonna
have a baby!

778
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:25,868
I mean, aren't you happy?

779
00:47:25,903 --> 00:47:28,033
I'd be happy if you go see
those doctors in Boston.

780
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:29,334
Why?

781
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,567
'Cause all the doctors
on this island are hicks.

782
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:36,767
Except this one lady doctor
with great boobs.

783
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,501
Oh.

784
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:47,567
Didn't expect
the Spanish Inquisition.

785
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,434
Alright, um...

786
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,701
The stress test doesn't
look that good to us.

787
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:56,534
There's weakness
in two of your valves.

788
00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:01,934
And we, uh, discussed it
and we think it would be...

789
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:03,734
prudent for you
to terminate the pregnancy.

790
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:05,701
No.

791
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:06,801
Suzanne...

792
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:08,234
No.

793
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:10,033
Look, I didn't just fall
off the truck, Phil.

794
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:11,701
I'm a doctor too.

795
00:48:11,736 --> 00:48:14,234
I know what the risks are.

796
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,534
I also know that
if the three of you help me,

797
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:19,267
I can have this baby.

798
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:20,634
Am I wrong?

799
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,234
Am I wrong?

800
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,734
I don't know.

801
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:30,434
Is that your
medical opinion?

802
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:36,267
Alright, tough guy, we can,
um, give it some time,

803
00:48:36,302 --> 00:48:37,334
see what happens.

804
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,234
Thank you.

805
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:42,400
Yeah.

806
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:44,901
Oh, be careful.

807
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:45,968
Look, if they
don't think

808
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:47,434
you should have
the baby, Suzanne--

809
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,100
No, I want
the baby, Matt.
We can adopt.

810
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,634
No, I wanna have
our baby.

811
00:48:50,669 --> 00:48:53,767
Honey, I know that this
is gonna work out. Okay?

812
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:56,234
So three hot-shot doctors
are wrong and you're right.

813
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:57,701
Look, they agreed
to help, so--

814
00:48:57,736 --> 00:48:59,868
And you gave 'em
a choice?
Well, it's my body.

815
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,467
Oh, so that makes
suicide, alright.

816
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:02,534
Suicide?

817
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:03,801
If you kill yourself
for this baby,

818
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:04,801
I call it suicide.

819
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,367
Oh, God, you--
What?

820
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,801
You don't--
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

821
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:10,767
What, the house painter
can't have an opinion?

822
00:49:10,802 --> 00:49:13,334
No, not about medicine. No!
It's not about medicine.

823
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:15,000
It's about you
risking your life!

824
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,934
And I can have
an opinion about that!

825
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:19,200
I can have an opinion
about the-- the one woman

826
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:20,467
in this world
that I love!

827
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:21,601
That I will not
live without!

828
00:49:21,636 --> 00:49:23,868
Okay, okay, okay.

829
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:26,434
It's okay to worry, honey.
It's okay to worry.

830
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:29,501
You got-- you gotta
trust me on this, Matt.

831
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:32,534
Alright? I'm not gonna
put myself in danger.

832
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,400
I promise you that.

833
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:38,033
I love you too much.
I'm not gonna leave you.

834
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:43,968
Just, please, don't give up
on this baby, okay?

835
00:50:21,302 --> 00:50:23,400
I can stay.

836
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:24,801
All weekend?

837
00:50:24,836 --> 00:50:27,334
I think Walter Cronkite'll
muddle through.

838
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:35,067
You know, I-- I know
that it's hard for you.

839
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:38,434
I mean, I could--

840
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:42,200
I could come up
to the Vineyard
one weekend.

841
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:46,834
I can take the ferry over
and you could pick me up

842
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:48,234
and drive me around.

843
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:50,534
Or no, we, uh--
we could rent bikes

844
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:54,200
and then ride around,
you know, if it's nice out.

845
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:57,734
And then you could show me
all the local spots.

846
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:03,167
And then you could
show me your house.

847
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:05,934
Then you could
show me your bed.
No.

848
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,400
What?
No.

849
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:09,868
No what?

850
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:13,100
Nothing. Let's just go
back to the table.

851
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,167
You don't want me
in your bed?
Is that it?

852
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,234
Don't, please.

853
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:19,868
Don't what?

854
00:51:19,903 --> 00:51:21,734
Don't say anything
that might disturb you?

855
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:24,067
Well, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know

856
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:28,267
what will disturb you
because you won't tell me.

857
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,534
I have to go.

858
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:34,934
Oh, no you don't.

859
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:38,801
Cabby!

860
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:39,901
Wait one damn minute!
Cabby!

861
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:41,067
I don't wanna talk
about it, Kate.

862
00:51:41,102 --> 00:51:42,067
Well, too bad!
Kate!

863
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,534
I have had it, buddy!

864
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:46,634
I'm so sick of tip-toeing
around here!

865
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:48,901
You have problems?
Well, boo hoo!

866
00:51:48,936 --> 00:51:50,000
I have problems too!

867
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:51,601
Yeah, so I've heard.
Yeah!

868
00:51:51,636 --> 00:51:53,601
Because when two people
sleep together,

869
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:55,834
they're supposed to share
more than just sex.

870
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:57,667
I am what I am.
Take it or leave it.

871
00:51:57,702 --> 00:51:58,734
That is not
how it works!

872
00:51:58,769 --> 00:51:59,767
Then it doesn't work!

873
00:51:59,802 --> 00:52:00,968
Stop!

874
00:52:01,003 --> 00:52:04,100
Cabby!
You will deal
with this!

875
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:05,701
Cabby!
You coward!

876
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:08,067
You coward!
You're just a coward!

877
00:52:08,102 --> 00:52:09,467
Coward! Coward!

878
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,667
Coward!

879
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:15,501
No!

880
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:31,968
Ready?

881
00:52:32,003 --> 00:52:34,667
I'm not goin' anywhere.

882
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,567
Oh...

883
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:41,968
That's beautiful.

884
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:43,634
Now watch.

885
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh...

886
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:54,200
For little Herman.

887
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:01,133
His name is Nicholas.

888
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,767
Kate?

889
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:21,434
I'm sorry.

890
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,300
Okay...

891
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:37,501
Once, there was
an ordinary man

892
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:41,133
who lived
on a special island

893
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:43,534
full of celebrities.

894
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:51,267
One night,
he went to Sam's Clams

895
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:54,067
and his life changed
for the good.

896
00:53:56,667 --> 00:54:00,701
Then it changed again
for the bad.

897
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:07,901
Then it changed again.

898
00:54:07,936 --> 00:54:10,968
He sold a book
of short stories.

899
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:14,133
After many years
of trying and failing,

900
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:19,133
it should have brought him
more pleasure than it did,

901
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:23,167
but what brought him
pleasure was the...

902
00:54:23,202 --> 00:54:27,667
smart and beautiful editor
they assigned him.

903
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:30,100
So they agreed
to a lunch date,

904
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:35,734
even though the restaurant
wasn't as good as Sam's Clams.

905
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:38,901
And she talked...

906
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:41,968
and listened.

907
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:47,067
And before
the crme brle came...

908
00:54:47,102 --> 00:54:50,634
he knew that she'd
change his life again.

909
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,434
That's it;
that's the best
I can do.

910
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:02,667
That's good enough.

911
00:55:18,636 --> 00:55:20,934
Hey, sweetheart!

912
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:22,667
There's nothin' to eat.

913
00:55:22,702 --> 00:55:26,167
Could you come down
and fix me something?

914
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:32,901
Well, if you're hungry,
then I'll just haul

915
00:55:32,936 --> 00:55:35,868
my ten-ton butt
outta bed

916
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:38,300
and make you
a bologna sandwich,

917
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,033
because you're a man,
and you couldn't possibly

918
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:43,000
put two pieces
of bread together--

919
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:45,968
Happy birthday!

920
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:50,133
I love you, honey.

921
00:55:50,168 --> 00:55:51,701
Hi.

922
00:55:51,736 --> 00:55:52,701
Did you get it?

923
00:55:52,736 --> 00:55:54,834
What did you get me?

924
00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:56,067
See ya.

925
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,467
Oh, God!

926
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:00,534
She got me
a black thong.

927
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:04,000
Honey, she got me
a thong.

928
00:56:04,035 --> 00:56:05,534
I'll never be able
to wear that again.

929
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:08,901
Okay.

930
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:11,133
What? Is-- is this
my gift?

931
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,167
Oh...

932
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,100
Oh, you have a bow.

933
00:56:14,135 --> 00:56:17,634
You've got a bow,
huh, huh?

934
00:56:29,003 --> 00:56:31,634
Wanna dance
with a house?

935
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:33,467
You sure?

936
00:56:33,502 --> 00:56:36,234
One slow dance.

937
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:50,367
Did you see me
holding Julia's baby?

938
00:56:50,402 --> 00:56:52,334
You're a natural.

939
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:54,367
Yes, I am.

940
00:56:54,402 --> 00:56:56,234
I mean, I know that
I'm a great doctor,

941
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:59,667
but I'm going to be
a fabulous mother.

942
00:56:59,702 --> 00:57:03,567
Hmm. You are.

943
00:57:03,602 --> 00:57:06,767
And I'm going to be
a great father.

944
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,601
Okay, you know what?

945
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:10,133
Enough dancing.

946
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:13,200
Let's go inside.
Alright.

947
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:14,567
Whoops.

948
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:20,300
Suzanne?

949
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:21,367
Matt...

950
00:57:31,636 --> 00:57:33,767
Suzanne, I'm right here.

951
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,701
Suzanne...

952
00:57:37,736 --> 00:57:38,767
Connie?

953
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:40,300
I'm sorry.

954
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:43,734
The Kind and I
at the playhouse.
I was Anna.

955
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,601
The baby, the baby...

956
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:50,400
Yes, we have a heartbeat.

957
00:57:50,435 --> 00:57:52,000
But we're more concerned
about you right now.

958
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,033
The baby...

959
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:54,767
Suzanne, Suzanne...

960
00:57:54,802 --> 00:57:55,701
The baby okay?

961
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:01,868
Hey, baby.

962
00:58:01,903 --> 00:58:05,834
Suzanne...

963
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:08,200
Suzanne?

964
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,200
Suzanne?

965
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:13,901
Suzanne?

966
00:58:14,968 --> 00:58:17,234
Better?

967
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:20,133
Oh, I'm really dry.

968
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,968
Here.

969
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:30,734
Oh, that's cold.

970
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:32,234
Okay.

971
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:34,834
We've got your BP
under control.

972
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:36,133
Your bloods are improving,

973
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:38,834
but I want to keep you here
just for tonight.

974
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:43,033
I gotta go call Melanie.
Everyone's waitin' to hear.

975
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:44,400
They're still awake?

976
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:48,100
I'll be right back.

977
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,834
Okay.

978
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:18,367
Matt, Matt, her stats
just dropped off the cliff.

979
00:59:18,402 --> 00:59:20,667
She's shutting down.
We have to take
the baby right now.

980
00:59:20,702 --> 00:59:22,334
Please, do not
get in my way.

981
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:23,334
It's 183.

982
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:24,400
Give it gas.

983
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,801
Here, put this on.

984
00:59:25,836 --> 00:59:28,601
Suzanne,
I'm right here,
alright?

985
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,567
It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

986
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,234
Give me a 10 blade
and separators on the field.

987
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:36,968
Got it.

988
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,734
I'm right here, Suzanne.

989
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:42,667
Infuse three grams
of magnesium sulfate.

990
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:50,834
I've got my O2 at 100%.
O2 stat's at 93.

991
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:52,400
I'm right here, baby.

992
00:59:52,435 --> 00:59:53,834
It's okay.
It's gonna be alright.

993
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:55,667
We're gonna need
separators--

994
00:59:55,702 --> 00:59:57,601
It'll be okay.

995
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:03,767
Baby not responsive.

996
01:00:03,802 --> 01:00:05,601
He's not moving.

997
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:07,601
Respiratory's down--

998
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,567
Get me suction.

999
01:00:11,602 --> 01:00:14,100
I need a bag.

1000
01:00:14,135 --> 01:00:17,100
He's not moving.

1001
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:20,434
Right here,
I gotta give it suction.

1002
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:22,567
Turn it up to a hundred.

1003
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:24,868
Great, I think
I got something.

1004
01:00:24,903 --> 01:00:27,667
Pressure's holding,
130 over 69.

1005
01:00:27,702 --> 01:00:29,100
Monitor is steady.

1006
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:31,033
Here we go.
Let's move that up.

1007
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:32,868
Uh-huh.

1008
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:53,033
We're gonna need
a monitor and an EPG.

1009
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,033
It's okay.
He won't break.

1010
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:15,300
There you go.

1011
01:01:23,234 --> 01:01:27,200
I will never forget
that moment, Nicky.

1012
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:32,067
I got to hold you in my arms
before they took you away.

1013
01:01:32,102 --> 01:01:36,133
I got to whisper
for the first time ever,

1014
01:01:36,168 --> 01:01:41,234
"I love you,
Nicholas the warrior."

1015
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:54,734
Matt?

1016
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:56,234
Whaddaya think?

1017
01:01:56,269 --> 01:01:58,000
I mean, forget
the packing boxes.

1018
01:01:58,035 --> 01:02:00,100
And I'm-- I'm gonna get
some more furniture.

1019
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:02,200
Well, I have a bed.

1020
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:05,367
And just because I never cook
doesn't mean I can't.

1021
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:08,167
It just means it's a pain
to cook for one person.

1022
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:10,734
I hope you like
what I'm making.

1023
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:16,300
It's a special meal because
it's a very special night.

1024
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:18,400
I said,
it's a special meal

1025
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,434
because it's a very
special night.

1026
01:02:23,234 --> 01:02:25,400
I have a present
for you.

1027
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:33,434
I can't do it.

1028
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:36,634
I thought I could.

1029
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,567
I wanted to.

1030
01:02:43,534 --> 01:02:46,033
And it doesn't
help you any.

1031
01:02:46,068 --> 01:02:48,701
I wish--

1032
01:02:48,736 --> 01:02:50,100
I just--

1033
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:54,901
I can't.

1034
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:09,033
Oh, wait.

1035
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:11,534
I have a present for you.

1036
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:17,434
See?

1037
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:21,667
It's a rattle.

1038
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,501
See?

1039
01:03:28,234 --> 01:03:31,467
I'm pregnant,
you son of a bitch!

1040
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:42,133
Ah, Ms. Wilkes.

1041
01:03:42,168 --> 01:03:43,300
How are you today?

1042
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:45,100
Knocked up.

1043
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,868
Congratulations.

1044
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:50,300
You are most
definitely pregnant.

1045
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,434
Great.

1046
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,601
I, uh, I have a friend
who's been trying

1047
01:03:55,636 --> 01:03:57,834
to get pregnant
for the past year.

1048
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:00,434
I miss one pill,
and bang.

1049
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,534
As it were.

1050
01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:05,200
How did you miss
your pill?

1051
01:04:05,235 --> 01:04:07,133
Oh, you know...

1052
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:14,100
I-- I thought it was gonna
work out with this guy...

1053
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:16,300
I understand.

1054
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:20,100
Well, the, uh, pregnancy's
at a very early stage.

1055
01:04:20,135 --> 01:04:21,567
At this point we can
terminate it

1056
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:24,567
with a simple DNC.

1057
01:04:24,602 --> 01:04:26,067
Good.

1058
01:04:26,102 --> 01:04:30,601
Good. Um, let me just
check my week, um...

1059
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,634
crying
Oh, my God.

1060
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:53,100
No.

1061
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,934
Suzanne, that's enough!

1062
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:13,400
Honey, I'm supposed
to exercise.

1063
01:05:13,435 --> 01:05:16,834
Ask my 15 doctors.

1064
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,868
Suzanne?

1065
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:20,467
What?

1066
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:23,601
He misses you.

1067
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,167
He told me.

1068
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:35,767
Ugh, Suzanne!

1069
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:42,701
Okay.

1070
01:05:47,901 --> 01:05:49,000
Come on.
Hey!

1071
01:05:49,035 --> 01:05:50,033
I wanna get there.

1072
01:05:50,068 --> 01:05:52,000
Before it gets
too cold!
Hey!

1073
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:53,667
Come on!

1074
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,501
Whoohoo!

1075
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:07,834
So?

1076
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,200
There you go.

1077
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:12,200
Yeah?

1078
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,601
Not all pale and sick?

1079
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:16,868
The patients don't wanna
see a sick doctor.

1080
01:06:16,903 --> 01:06:18,033
I don't blame 'em.

1081
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:19,200
Okay.

1082
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:21,767
Okay.

1083
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:31,901
Come in.

1084
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:33,868
Aw...

1085
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:35,133
Show him off.

1086
01:06:35,168 --> 01:06:36,300
Aw, isn't he a cutie?

1087
01:06:36,335 --> 01:06:37,300
That it?

1088
01:06:37,335 --> 01:06:38,400
That's him.

1089
01:06:38,435 --> 01:06:39,567
He the runt
of the litter?

1090
01:06:39,602 --> 01:06:40,801
Shut up, Earl.

1091
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:43,968
Okay, let me say "good-bye"
to my little boy.

1092
01:06:44,003 --> 01:06:46,901
Okay, alright.

1093
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:50,667
Bye, Mel.
Thank you so much.

1094
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:52,968
Okay, who's first?

1095
01:06:53,003 --> 01:06:54,167
As if I didn't know.

1096
01:06:54,202 --> 01:06:55,167
Well, that's pretty typical.

1097
01:06:56,434 --> 01:06:58,334
I thought your numbness
was on the left side, Earl.

1098
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:00,300
Shifted.

1099
01:07:04,133 --> 01:07:06,400
That was more
than half a day.

1100
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:08,067
What was I supposed
to do, sweetie?

1101
01:07:08,102 --> 01:07:09,634
Tell Mrs. Garner
to take her walker

1102
01:07:09,669 --> 01:07:10,734
and get outta there?

1103
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:13,968
You said half a day,
Connie said half a day.

1104
01:07:14,003 --> 01:07:15,133
How's the baby?

1105
01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:16,934
Scared you weren't
comin' back.

1106
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,434
I'm not kiddin',
Suzanne.

1107
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,267
Yeah, I know;
that's the scary thing.

1108
01:07:21,302 --> 01:07:23,167
Alright, up to bed.
I'm gonna get you something--

1109
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:24,167
Matt.

1110
01:07:24,202 --> 01:07:25,367
--to eat.
Matt.

1111
01:07:25,402 --> 01:07:28,968
Protein.
Matt, Matt,
Matt, Matt.

1112
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,901
You've gotta stop.

1113
01:07:30,936 --> 01:07:31,901
Okay?

1114
01:07:31,936 --> 01:07:34,334
You have to stop
hovering and worrying,

1115
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:36,767
and worrying
and hovering.

1116
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,167
I know.

1117
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:40,267
You're really starting
to become a gigantic

1118
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:41,701
pain in the ass.

1119
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:42,901
I know.

1120
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:47,467
I'm fine.
Alright?

1121
01:07:47,502 --> 01:07:49,067
The doctor said
I'm fine.

1122
01:07:49,102 --> 01:07:51,534
And not just
the hick doctors.

1123
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:53,133
I know.

1124
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:56,200
I promise to be
a smaller pain in the ass.

1125
01:07:56,235 --> 01:07:59,701
Sweetie, I take care
of these people, you know?

1126
01:07:59,736 --> 01:08:01,868
I owe them.

1127
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:05,234
Now I'm gonna go
kiss my beautiful child

1128
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:06,934
and go for a run
on the beach.

1129
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:09,267
A walk on the beach.

1130
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:12,767
So, what, you gonna
take it to work
with you every day?

1131
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:14,200
I wouldn't be
the first.

1132
01:08:14,235 --> 01:08:17,133
Yeah? You gonna nurse it
in front of your authors?

1133
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:18,801
Or, you could
keep it home,

1134
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:21,200
get a nanny who makes
more money than you.

1135
01:08:21,235 --> 01:08:23,300
Shh!

1136
01:08:23,335 --> 01:08:25,334
Or, Kate, I know.

1137
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:28,267
Just quit, move back home
with Ma and Pa,

1138
01:08:28,302 --> 01:08:29,767
get a job
at the Piggly Wiggly.

1139
01:08:29,802 --> 01:08:31,167
I am not calling him.

1140
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:33,133
He's a decent guy.

1141
01:08:33,168 --> 01:08:35,701
He'll take
responsibility, Kate.
No, you're right.

1142
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,234
If I call him, he'll come
and he would try
to make it right.

1143
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:40,100
And tell his wife.
He would, yeah.

1144
01:08:40,135 --> 01:08:43,400
And then she would divorce him
and he would marry you,

1145
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:46,767
and move to the city
and take care of the kid.

1146
01:08:46,802 --> 01:08:50,334
And he would hate me...
for the rest of his life.

1147
01:08:53,335 --> 01:08:56,133
You'd get alimony.

1148
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:57,968
That's very funny.
That's great.

1149
01:08:58,003 --> 01:08:59,934
I am not calling him.

1150
01:09:05,235 --> 01:09:07,434
Ready?

1151
01:09:07,469 --> 01:09:08,901
No.

1152
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,601
He's almost
four months old.

1153
01:09:11,636 --> 01:09:13,801
Oh, and he hasn't
been to college yet?

1154
01:09:31,502 --> 01:09:33,601
He loves it.

1155
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,767
[baby crying

1156
01:09:38,534 --> 01:09:41,100
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh.

1157
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,000
Shh, it's okay.

1158
01:09:43,035 --> 01:09:44,701
It's okay, sweetheart

1159
01:09:44,736 --> 01:09:45,868
It's okay.
Mama's here.

1160
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:48,868
Oh, oh...
Oh, no, no, no.

1161
01:09:48,903 --> 01:09:51,367
Shh, shh, shh.

1162
01:09:51,402 --> 01:09:54,267
It's alright.
It's alright.

1163
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:57,000
It's okay, honey.
Don't be scared.

1164
01:09:57,035 --> 01:09:58,834
Don't be scared.
Mama's here.

1165
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:01,334
Mama's here.

1166
01:10:02,968 --> 01:10:05,868
I'll always be here.

1167
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:08,000
My little boy.

1168
01:10:30,067 --> 01:10:32,434
I'm gonna start
full time.

1169
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:34,300
Tomorrow.

1170
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,501
What?

1171
01:10:38,536 --> 01:10:40,767
The New Yorker.

1172
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:49,234
"Dear Mr. Harrelson,
we very much enjoyed

1173
01:10:49,269 --> 01:10:54,067
"your short story,

1176

Matt...

1177
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:01,868
Oh, Matt.

1178
01:11:01,903 --> 01:11:03,334
It only took me
seven years.

1179
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:04,968
They want me to come
to their office.

1180
01:11:05,003 --> 01:11:06,501
They wanna bathe
in the author's light.

1181
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:09,167
It's important.
It is?

1182
01:11:09,202 --> 01:11:10,834
The first story that
you write about our family

1183
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:12,934
is the first story
you sell?

1184
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:13,834
It's important.

1185
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,834
Good things
to happen for us.

1186
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:18,300
So should I wear
my blue suit?

1187
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:26,000
Look what I found.

1188
01:11:26,035 --> 01:11:27,834
"Gordon Grey,
the best photographer

1189
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:29,367
"on Martha's Vineyard:

01:11:29,402 --> 01:11:31,667
special occasions,

1191
01:11:31,702 --> 01:11:33,534
Hmm.

1192
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:34,968
Gordo's a hack.

1193
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,300
If you say so, my love.

1194
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,634
You're not gonna
take Nicholas there

1195
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:38,868
the minute
I walk away, right?

1196
01:11:42,234 --> 01:11:43,634
Bye.

1197
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:51,467
Are you ready for
your close-up, baby doll?

1198
01:11:51,502 --> 01:11:53,667
Yeah? Are you?

1199
01:12:26,702 --> 01:12:29,300
You're not gonna tell
anybody about this, right?

1200
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:31,434
Especially not Daddy.

1201
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:35,634
It'll be our little secret.

1202
01:12:35,669 --> 01:12:39,934
Our little $147 secret.

1203
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:50,133
Oh, yeah.

1204
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:52,133
Looks good, though.

1205
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:53,534
I could use some help.

1206
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,367
Yeah, honey, I know, but I have
to go into town really quickly.

1207
01:12:56,402 --> 01:12:57,634
They're gonna be here
in an hour.

1208
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:59,267
I know.
I just wanna grab--

1209
01:12:59,302 --> 01:13:01,000
We have everything we need.

1210
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:02,167
I just better make sure--

1211
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:04,501
Except the baby pictures.

1212
01:13:04,536 --> 01:13:07,167
Which I'm sure are classics.

1213
01:13:07,202 --> 01:13:09,834
Oh, honey.
He was so cute.

1214
01:13:11,868 --> 01:13:12,901
I'll be back
in plenty of time, okay?

1215
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:14,901
The food's all ready.

1216
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:32,501
Hello, my sweet Nicholas.
It's Daddy.

1217
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:39,601
I have to write this.

1218
01:13:39,636 --> 01:13:43,868
I can't think of anything
now except that I have
to talk to you.

1219
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,367
But this is so hard,
little boy.

1220
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:52,467
This is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

1221
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:07,834
Bye!

1222
01:14:07,869 --> 01:14:08,801
Love you.

1223
01:14:13,267 --> 01:14:17,000
I let her leave.
I didn't stop her.

1224
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,133
I didn't even go to her.

1225
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,968
I never even got to
kiss her goodbye, Nicky.

1226
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:25,033
Because you see,
my sweet boy,

1227
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,200
Mommy had a heart attack
on the way into town.

1228
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:39,300
Her car went through
the guard rail at the cove.

1229
01:14:41,701 --> 01:14:44,701
The doctor said
she died before the crash.

1230
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:50,834
He said she didn't
feel any pain at all.

1231
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,300
I want to believe him.

1232
01:15:18,634 --> 01:15:21,767
I wind up your music box
and it begins to play.

1233
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:34,767
I reach into your crib and
I touch your sweet cheek.

1234
01:15:34,802 --> 01:15:37,934
I place an index finger
in each of your little hands

1235
01:15:37,969 --> 01:15:39,367
and let you squeeze.

1236
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,601
You're very strong.

1237
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:50,667
But you're not
in your crib, are you.

1238
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:09,367
Because you went
with Mommy that day.

1239
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,734
She strapped you
into your car seat

1240
01:16:15,769 --> 01:16:18,634
and drove you to town.

1241
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,267
She wanted you to be the
first to see your photographs.

1242
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:06,901
Oh, my God.

1243
01:17:25,302 --> 01:17:28,334
This is Vineyard Home Services.
Matt isn't here right now,

1244
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:32,367
if you leave a message,
he'll get back to you
as soon as he can. Thanks.

1245
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:35,667
Matt.

1246
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:38,200
I understand now.

1247
01:17:42,003 --> 01:17:46,367
And I can't begin to tell
you on this damn machine

1248
01:17:46,402 --> 01:17:49,033
how sorry I am.

1249
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,367
God, I want to talk to you.

1250
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,100
I just--

1251
01:17:55,135 --> 01:17:56,601
Wanna tell you
how I'm feeling,

1252
01:17:56,636 --> 01:17:57,901
that's all.

1253
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:05,601
So, um, can you
call me back? Please.

1254
01:18:14,701 --> 01:18:18,033
So, then Steven's
mother makes a face.

1255
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,501
Mmm.

1256
01:18:19,536 --> 01:18:22,300
She doesn't say anything,
she just takes one bite,

1257
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:26,400
makes "the face",
and puts her fork down.

1258
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,067
But the face says it all.

1259
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:30,701
My daughter-in-law to be
is one step above a hooker.

1260
01:18:30,736 --> 01:18:34,467
What I had in mind was a vine,

1261
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:37,501
curling around both sides
of the title,

1262
01:18:37,536 --> 01:18:40,901
as if springing from
the base of the book itself.

1263
01:18:40,936 --> 01:18:46,834
In a kind of...
paean to medieval illuminati.

1264
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:49,200
I also think...

1265
01:19:57,701 --> 01:20:01,000
Um, excuse me--

1266
01:20:01,035 --> 01:20:03,667
The tour bus
is down Pleasant Street.

1267
01:20:03,702 --> 01:20:08,334
Oh, no. Actually
I'm looking for someone.

1268
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:10,467
He comes in here quite often.

1269
01:20:10,502 --> 01:20:12,000
I thought you might
know where he lives.

1270
01:20:12,035 --> 01:20:13,634
Got a name?

1271
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:15,868
Um... Matt Harrelson.

1272
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:22,167
You take Water Street to the
Prospect Road straight on out.

1273
01:20:22,202 --> 01:20:24,467
Can't miss it.
Big yellow thing.

1274
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:29,968
Thanks, Earl.

1275
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,167
Matt!

1276
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:00,868
Hello.

1277
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:07,434
Matt.

1278
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,267
Matt.

1279
01:21:50,934 --> 01:21:52,100
Kate.

1280
01:21:52,135 --> 01:21:54,734
Yes.

1281
01:21:54,769 --> 01:21:56,400
Oh, I'm--

1282
01:21:56,435 --> 01:21:58,834
Melanie.
Across the road.

1283
01:21:58,869 --> 01:21:59,767
Yeah.

1284
01:21:59,802 --> 01:22:02,200
The door wasn't
locked, so I...

1285
01:22:02,235 --> 01:22:05,334
Oh, it's an island.

1286
01:22:06,934 --> 01:22:08,934
Yeah.

1287
01:22:08,969 --> 01:22:11,367
He, he told me about you.

1288
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:13,767
He did?

1289
01:22:13,802 --> 01:22:15,300
Yeah.

1290
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:21,434
Do you know when
he's gonna be back?

1291
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:24,000
He's gone.

1292
01:22:24,035 --> 01:22:25,934
Gone?

1293
01:22:25,969 --> 01:22:27,067
Gone.

1294
01:22:27,102 --> 01:22:28,834
Off the island.

1295
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:30,267
Gone.

1296
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,133
Matt.

1297
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:34,133
I got your messages.

1298
01:23:34,168 --> 01:23:39,267
I just wanted to thank you
in person for your sympathy.

1299
01:23:39,302 --> 01:23:43,100
And for driving out to the
Vineyard, I just wanted you
to know that I appreciate it.

1300
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:47,267
That I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1301
01:24:00,334 --> 01:24:02,200
I...

1302
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:09,033
I drove up to Maine,
took the blue roads.

1303
01:24:09,068 --> 01:24:12,200
Didn't pay much
attention to anything.

1304
01:24:14,934 --> 01:24:16,767
Stopped when it got dark.

1305
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:22,734
I thought about
the first time we met.

1306
01:24:25,234 --> 01:24:28,234
I didn't want to meet you.

1307
01:24:28,269 --> 01:24:31,200
I didn't want to see you.

1308
01:24:31,235 --> 01:24:33,701
I didn't want to start
anything with anyone.

1309
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:36,200
I did my house painting

1310
01:24:36,235 --> 01:24:39,834
and I wrote
in my little corner.

1311
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:42,367
And I went to sleep.

1312
01:24:42,402 --> 01:24:45,300
And when I couldn't sleep,

1313
01:24:45,335 --> 01:24:48,167
which is most of the time...

1314
01:24:52,734 --> 01:24:54,601
I talked to Suzanne.

1315
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:58,834
In the dark it seemed
as though she was there.

1316
01:24:58,869 --> 01:25:01,767
And it worked.

1317
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:06,434
I found a kind of peace
in that house.

1318
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:08,801
And then I met you.

1319
01:25:08,836 --> 01:25:12,667
And my life changed.
Like I told you.

1320
01:25:12,702 --> 01:25:15,534
But it-- it wasn't--

1321
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,834
it was more than that.

1322
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:24,567
I...

1323
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:27,834
I started to feel myself...

1324
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:30,200
let go of Suzanne.

1325
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:35,567
but I kept her close
to me for over a year.

1326
01:25:35,602 --> 01:25:39,300
I checked Nicholas' crib and...

1327
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:43,834
...every single day.

1328
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:51,534
I was faithful.

1329
01:25:51,569 --> 01:25:56,434
I couldn't stand
letting them go.

1330
01:25:56,469 --> 01:26:00,567
I blamed fate
for bringing me to you.

1331
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:02,601
I blamed ambition.

1332
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:04,133
But most of all I blamed you.

1333
01:26:04,168 --> 01:26:07,000
And I knew that was wrong.

1334
01:26:07,035 --> 01:26:10,634
Suzanne and Nicholas died,

1335
01:26:10,669 --> 01:26:14,767
and I couldn't know
they were gonna die.

1336
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,634
And I couldn't
have saved them.

1337
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:21,434
They're gone.
Both of them.

1338
01:26:21,469 --> 01:26:23,934
For whatever reason
I'm not...

1339
01:26:26,133 --> 01:26:27,701
I'm still here.

1340
01:26:29,534 --> 01:26:32,067
Because I'm still here...

1341
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:38,267
I am required to carry on.

1342
01:26:38,302 --> 01:26:41,667
That's what I figured out
driving north.

1343
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,901
That I'm required
to carry on.

1344
01:26:51,901 --> 01:26:53,634
That's just the way it is.

1345
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:05,601
Matt. Um...

1346
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:11,267
But wouldn't you like
another chance?

1347
01:27:11,302 --> 01:27:13,534
At what?

1348
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:14,968
Everything.

1349
01:27:16,767 --> 01:27:19,834
Love and...

1350
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:22,501
marriage.

1351
01:27:25,467 --> 01:27:27,000
Children.

1352
01:27:29,067 --> 01:27:30,501
Yes.

1353
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:33,801
I lived four months
with Nicholas.

1354
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:37,801
Four months was
not enough time.

1355
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:45,300
I'm sorry. I didn't come
here to make you cry.

1356
01:27:52,534 --> 01:27:54,100
Matt.

1357
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:56,267
What?

1358
01:28:10,367 --> 01:28:12,767
It'll keep.

1359
