Katherine, when you
send a broadcast

410
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,637
you're sending
out these numbers
to the agents in the field

411
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,439

assignments they cannot

412

communication lines.

what that means?

Can't read that.

422
00:37:56,073 --> 00:38:01,378
Agents in the field carry,
like, one-time notebooks,
like pads.

423
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,446
Each page is
a new cypher.

424
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,614
When you broadcast something,

425
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,049
the agent matches
up the first set

426
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,684
of numbers to
the page in the notebook.

427
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,286
<i>Now he knows he's</i>
<i>using this page,</i>

428
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:11,021
<i>and this page only,</i>
<i>to decode the message.</i>

429
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:14,057
<i>When he's done,</i>
<i>he destroys the page.</i>

430
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,627
So we send another broadcast
to cancel this one.

431
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,563

a one-time deal.

boss. Somebody high up
in the company.

529
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,527
Director Atwater.

530
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,863
Director Collins.

531
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,631
Templeman.

532
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,600
Keep going.

533
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,635
Yeah, these are
people being groomed

534
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:42,138

the corporation.

535

536

I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.

537
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,181
Fifteen dossiers.

538
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,584
Fifteen broadcasts.

539
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,220
There it is.

540
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,989
If I wanted to
cripple the system
in one fell swoop,

541
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,025
these would be
the 15 I'd start with.

542
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:03,793
You kill these men today,

543
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,696
you won't recognize the
world when you wake
up in the morning.

544
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:08,498
But they've already
sent the broadcasts.

545
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,899
I mean, what the hell
do they want with us?

546
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,904
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't
cancel the broadcasts.

547
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,142
Grab that.
Let's go.

548
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,398
Here.

549

from the laptop,

we don't get out of here.

Grabbed my file

You fit a profile.

Of what?

578
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,884
Civilian broadcasters
have a certain, you know,
personality trait.

579
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:08,551
Keep working.

580
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:13,623
Well, I can't work in silence,
so you might as
well just entertain me.

581
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,857
Okay.

582
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:16,525
A troubled childhood
with an emphasis

583
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,461
on extreme emotional
loss or fatigue.

584
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,329
Death of a parent.
Sometimes sexual abuse.

585
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:21,864
Lack of a strong
authority figure
in adolescence.

586
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:27,136
Low self-esteem resulting in
few permanent relationships.
Defensive.

587
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,304
Rebellious.
Highly intelligent.

588
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:33,242
Susceptible to being
stuck in one position,
environment or occupation

589
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,477
for long periods of time.

590

Wow... Yeah,
you're terrible at this.

591

How about your profile?

592
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:41,584
Indifferent and
emotionally detached
from reality.

593
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,219
Inability to communicate
with any other

594
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,520
human being on
the face of this Earth.

595
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,556
Willing to sit
silently in one place
for hours at a time.

596
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:52,762
Make sure that you have a plan
to kill every person
that you ever meet.

597
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,531
No. Close.

598
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,465
No, I had a stable childhood

599
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:59,835
but with an underlying desire
to break free from
control or authority.

600
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:01,304
Restless.
Sense of self-entitlement.

601
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:05,308
Striking lack of empathy
or compassion
for other people.

602
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,976
Bordering between autism...

603
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,678
Stop.

604
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,282
You know, I, um,
didn't always do this.

605
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,285
This is my first
station assignment.

00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,991
I was on the other
end of the numbers.

607
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,531

black-book tax dollars.

opportunity I'd ever have.

00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:43,045
Told me I'd do special
things, important things.

611
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,283
Well, you're worth
more than

612
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,452

bureaucrat wrote down

613
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:52,254

talking about is

I knew a guy once,
and he decided
he wanted to quit.

620
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:14,043
He squirreled away money for
about 20 years and
he opened up a bar

621
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:16,779
and wanted to
create a new life,

622
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:21,350
and he survived
about 37 months.

623
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,918
They killed him?

624
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,687

874
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,580
I used to work for
the same righteous pricks
who twisted your life.

875
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:26,754
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but
they pay a lot more.

876
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,790
They break us, you know.

877
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:33,294
Turn us into
these awful things.

878
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:36,597
Broken pieces.
They push us.

879
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,799
Make us into
men we're not.

880
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:42,470
And then complain
when we no longer function.

881
01:15:42,472 --> 01:15:45,740
They think we should
live like this is normal.

882
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:50,111
Like this is how
we should behave,
how we should think.

883
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:52,547
And our reward
for this life?

884
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:54,715
We try to run away
and they kill us because

885
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,684
of what they
forced inside our heads.

886
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:59,720
You think men like
that deserve to live?

887
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:04,025
They deserve
everything they
got coming.

888
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,626
Maybe.

889
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,630
Did you stop
the broadcasts?

890
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,667
Yeah.

891
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,037
Why?

892
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:21,609
Some fleeting
virtue in not being
a mass murderer.

893
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,416
I take it you're
not a religious man?

894
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,218
You don't believe
in a guiding light?

895
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,153
No.

896
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:36,657
You're like me, then.
Floundering in wet shit.

897
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:38,192
Yeah.

898
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,597
How long do you think
we can go on like this?

Still at this,
are we?

907
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,645
So, you told me
she was dead.

908
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,981
Look, tell me.

909
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,119
Burnt down,
a man's worth $4.40.

910
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:27,555
Excuse me?
That's what you said.

911
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:28,823
When?

912
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:29,957
In the car.

913
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:33,994
When all's said
and done, you know,
carbon and minerals.

914
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,598
A human being's worth
less than five bucks.

915
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,201
I said that?
Uh-huh.

916
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:43,604
Well, you know me,
I talk a lot of shit.

917
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:44,905
But if you say I
said it, then I suppose

918
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:47,208
I should believe you.
What about it?

919
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,509
Hmm...

920
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,579
We walk.
Both of us.

921
01:20:54,916 --> 01:21:00,287
Well, you might
walk but her...
That's impossible.

922
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:01,255
She knows too much.

923
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:07,094
She's got the codes.
She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.

924
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,030
It's gotta stop.

925
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,765
I'll get you
a prescription for Ativan.

926
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,767
That will stop your
conscience bothering you.

927
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:16,704
Yeah. Well, take
a look at that.

928
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,040
It's a copy of
the broadcasts.

929
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,576
The ones she stopped.

930
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:27,281
Number 14 might be
of interest. It's you.

931
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:32,786
She took a bullet for you.
Gotta be worth
more than five bucks.

What do you want?

933
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:49,169
Give me a week.
Ten days.

934
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:52,706
And I'll find your
bodies at the station?

935
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,942
You'll find enough.
