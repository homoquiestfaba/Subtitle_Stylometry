- Shh.

533
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,897
I need that thing that you mentioned...

534
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,198
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the video.

535
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,466
- Hilarious, right?
- Hilarious.

536
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,538
Shut... uuuup.

537
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,173
Okay, so, yeah, I need that video removed

538
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,641
from your website, please.

539
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,609
Ah, yes, yeah.

540
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:36,911
I got to be honest with you guys.

541
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,679
This thing... this kind
of thing happens more

542
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,248
than you would imagine.

543
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,483
Not the microphone thing.

544
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:42,683
But the embarrassment thing.

545
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:44,518
And here's the problem.

546
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:49,323
Once a video is uploaded to the
Internet, it's there forever.

547
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:53,695
Your best bet is to actually
go into YouTube itself

548
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:57,465
and change the video from the inside.

549
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:00,267
So you mean, like, go into YouTube,

550
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:02,236
like, Tron-style?

551
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,905
No, you're messing with us, right?

552
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:05,840
- There's... you... what is this?
- Yeah, that's not...

553
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:07,641
- That's not possible.
- That doesn't sound possible.

554
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:11,245
Hey, guys, I'm Steve Friggin' YouTube.

555
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,516
If I say you can get up inside YouTube,

556
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,752
then you can get up inside YouTube.

557
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:20,688
I did not mean for that to
sound sexual. I apologize.

558
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:24,526
What I should have said is, if
you wanna penetrate YouTube...

559
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,461
That was worse. You know what?

560
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:29,330
Forget it. My point is this.

561
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:32,866
I have to do this kind of
thing for people all the time.

562
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,769
You guys remember Gangnam style?

563
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,004
Do you remember that video by that...

564
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,006
I think it was a Puerto Rican guy?

565
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,840
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

566
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:43,677
Well, you think Psy nailed
that video on the first take?

567
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:47,616
Nope. I actually think I have
the original video right here.

568
00:22:47,648 --> 00:22:48,617
Check it out.

Right? I mean, there's
not even a dancing horse.

575
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,996
How hard is it to get a horse to dance?

576
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,697
Probably not that hard.

577
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:05,467
(Steve YouTube) It's very hard.

578
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,502
No, no, no, this is
perfect. This is perfect.

579
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:11,339
So how do we, uh, get inside
YouTube to fix our video?

580
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:13,440
Great question. Simple answer.

581
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:17,479
There's actually a portal
right under my desk.

582
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:21,316
- A portal?
- That doesn't sound right.

583
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:25,287
This, um, this doesn't seem safe.

584
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,057
Guys, it's me, Steve, YouTube.

585
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,558
Steve YouTube.

586
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,859
If I say there's a portal under my desk

587
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:33,494
that will get you into YouTube,

588
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:36,064
there's a portal under my desk.

589
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:38,667
It just kind of seems like, you
know, we might crawl down there,

590
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:41,802
and you might have your
wiener out or, some...

591
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:42,804
- Excuse me?
- Definitely your wiener.

592
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:45,040
Excuse me.

593
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:48,475
I don't know what kind of
meeting you thought this was.

594
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:52,614
Frankly, I find that suggestion offensive.

595
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,582
I'm Steve YouTube. I created all of this.

596
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:58,353
You think I would jeopardize
that by putting my,

597
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,388
what did you say, "wiener" out?

598
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,324
I don't think so. Now, look, I'm very busy.

599
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,826
You guys can see yourselves
out. If you don't wanna change

600
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,561
the video, you don't
wanna change the video.

601
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,929
Janice, get me Bethany
MySpace on the phone, please.

602
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:11,032
No, no, no I... It's
cool. We're gonna do it.

603
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:12,933
We're gonna change our video.

604
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:14,401
- Yeah, just crawl...
- Really?

605
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,936
- All right.
- Yeah, go right around

606
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:17,705
- the desk and crawl under.
- Let's do it, man.

607
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:18,806
And go to the portal.

608
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,808
- Whoa!
- Oh my...

609
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,809
- What?
- Dude!

610
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:22,409
- That!
- [laughs]

611
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:23,845
- Damn it! Put it away!
- Oh! That's not...

612
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,114
You thought there was
a portal under my desk,

613
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:27,581
and you saw my wiener.

614
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:32,087
That is the best joke ever.

615
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,688
So there's no portal, then.
You're just messing with us.

616
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,858
Of course there's a portal.

617
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,494
But it's not under my desk, you morons.

618
00:24:39,526 --> 00:24:42,496
It's behind my closet door.

619
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,732
- Go on.
- Okay.

620
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:48,369
Yeah, it's just right there. Go on in.

621
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:53,408
Um, yeah, this doesn't
feel very safe either.

622
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,944
Guys, I had my fun,
okay, but fun time's over.

623
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:58,679
Not everything in life is a wiener joke.

624
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,955
(both) Holy shit!

625
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:10,023
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

626
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:11,493
Take these.

627
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:12,994
What do we do with these?

628
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:14,763
Gentlemen, meet Diri.

629
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:16,930
She'll be your guide
once you're on the inside.

630
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:19,067
(Diri) Hello, Ian. Hello Anthony.

631
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,570
I hope I can be of service to you both.

632
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:24,438
Wait, her name is "Diri"?

633
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:26,508
That's right. She's a
personal assistant software.

634
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,077
- So she's like Siri?
- Hey. Hey.

635
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,413
We don't draw that comparison here.

636
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,914
- You understand me?
- It's just that...

637
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:34,581
Hey, Bieber, you understand me?

638
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:36,618
Diri and Siri, it's kind of...

639
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,885
It's... it does kind of sound similar.

640
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:39,521
People are gonna draw the conclusions.

641
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:40,788
- It sounds...
- I'm gonna have my R&D team

642
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:42,590
take a look at that. Now listen to me.

643
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:45,192
Diri is gonna be your guide
once you get through that portal.

644
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:47,695
Anyplace you need to go, you tell Diri,

645
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:49,062
she will take you there.

646
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:51,132
Like, Siri.

647
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:52,966
Okay. Cool. Cool-cool.

648
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,539
All right. Safe travels, gentlemen.

649
00:25:57,571 --> 00:25:59,640
You sure you want to do this?

650
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:03,211
Yeah. If I don't do this,
I'll never be anything to Anna.

651
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,513
All right. I'm with you.

652
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,014
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

653
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:09,117
- B.
- F.

654
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:10,918
F. Let's go.

655
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,787
Let's do it.

656
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,756
- Ready?
- Yeah.

657
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,492
- Let's do this.
- You first.

658
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:20,160
[both shouting]

659
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,464

(man) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

663
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:32,873
Oh, man.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

668
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,220
Did we do it?

669
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,055
Are we in YouTube?

670
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:51,658
I don't know. It doesn't
really feel like YouTube.

671
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,995
Have you thought about
life insurance lately?

672
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,730
'Cause here at All-Chafe,

673

00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,934
Yup, we're definitely in YouTube.

675
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:01,168
It's this friggin' advertisement.

676
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,837
If you don't buy All-Chafe Insurance,

677
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,705
- there's a good chance...
- Diri,

678
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:07,040
can we skip this ad, please?

679
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:08,943
(Diri) Sure. Let me help you with that.

680
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,581
Uh, yeah, Diri, could
you also go full screen?

681
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:16,518
'Cause we can't see zilch.

682
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,854
(Diri) Certainly. I can do that.

683
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:22,924
That's better.

684
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:27,061

Diri, get us out of here.

690
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:41,975
(Diri) You said, "Get me
a beer." Is that correct?

What? No! I said, get us out of here!

And welcome to <i>Gorilla
Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

As you can see, I'm a pissed-off
gorilla with a chainsaw.

696
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,597
Doesn't really make a lot
of sense, but then again,

697
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:04,631
I don't really care.

00:34:57,578 --> 00:35:00,181
Oh, my goodness.

883
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:04,652
Big Rod 91?

884
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,087
I'm sorry about flagging all your comments.

885
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,256
I was playing hard to get.

886
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:11,157
I knew it.

887
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,359
What are you doing here?

888
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,728
Oh, it's a long story.

889
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:18,031
Well, pull up a table. We've got time.

890
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:20,101
Okay.

891
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,168
If you want the best
taste you've ever seen,

892
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:25,171
go out and get yourself
some Stone Cold Creamy Cream.

893
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:27,641
And that's the bottom line.

894
00:35:27,674 --> 00:35:30,011
[ice cream splatters]

895
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:31,679
Stone Cold Steve Austin?

896
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,547
- Oh, my God, it's me, Anthony.
- Who?

897
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,049
You know, we talk in
the mirror all the time.

898
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:37,585
Wait, you sell ice cream now?

899
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:40,654
Yeah, it's my new gimmick.
Stone Cold Creamy Cream.

900
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:43,056
It's the best.

901
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:44,391
Don't you think people
will get that confused

902
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:47,093
with Cold Stone Creamery?

903
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:49,196
Never heard of it.

904
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:52,165
Anyway, so I have a problem
I need your help with.

905
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,168
I embarrassed myself in
front of this girl I love

906
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:57,538
by doing a flip and then
landing directly on my face,

907
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:01,375
and then getting a
microphone shoved up my...

908
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:03,511
Mm. That's not good.

909
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:07,147
Yeah. So now I need her
to think I'm cool again.

910
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:09,316
What would you do if you were me?

911
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:10,650
Well, I'll tell you exactly what I'd do.

912
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:14,187
I'd hit her with the Stone Cold Stunner.

913
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,456
Oh, my God, of course you would.

914
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:17,590
- That's your move, man.
- Exactly.

915
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:19,359
Yeah, so you're basically saying

916
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,628
I should come up with my own move.

917
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,297
Not try to impress her, but just be myself.

918
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,132
No. I'm telling you, you need to hit her

919
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:26,500
with the Stone Cold Stunner.

920
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,802
Maybe even from a top rope.

921
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:31,638
Right. So I need to
climb to the top rope too,

922
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,307
and not be afraid of falling.

923
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:34,607
And I'll never know what I'm capable of

924
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:36,744
if I don't just get out there and try.

925
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,512
No, that's not what I'm saying!

926
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:40,548
I'm telling you to grab
her by that stack of dimes

927
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:43,484
she calls a neck, drop her
ass with a Stone Cold Stunner.

928
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:44,752
Yes! Oh, my God.

929
00:36:44,784 --> 00:36:46,453
Stone Cold Steve Austin, you're the best.

930
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,788
I can always count on you.

931
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:50,491
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

932
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:52,326
Kid's on 'shrooms.

933
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,127
(Diri) Stop. I can't stand

934
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,197
the silent treatment anymore.

935
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,266
Take me back, Anthony, and
I'll do better, I promise.

936
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:02,136
One final chance, that's
all I'm asking for.

937
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,804
Okay, fine. One final chance.

938
00:37:04,837 --> 00:37:09,542
Okay? Take me to Rockville
High Graduation Night 2009.

939
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:11,478
(Diri) Sure, I can help you with that.

940
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,447
- [phone beeping]
- See? It was that easy.

941
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:19,419
Damn it, Diri, this is not what
I asked for and you know it.

942
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:20,888
(Diri) But this is it.

943
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,890
It's Rockville High Graduation Night, 2009.

944
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:25,860
- I swear.
- Anna?

945
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:28,462
(Diri) Who is Anna?

946
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:30,498
Hi, everybody, or, you
know, the three people

947
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,233
that actually watch my stupid vlogs.

948
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,735
Mom, Dad, Uncle Keith's ghost,

949
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,271
tonight is graduation night.

950
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:39,139
I can't believe it's really her.

951
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:41,207
She's getting ready for
the graduation party.

952
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,409
(Diri) Anthony, we need to talk.

953
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,578
Shh. No, we don't.

954
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:49,850
So, I did the Moonwalk
for Ring Finger Largeasia

955
00:37:49,882 --> 00:37:50,917
last weekend.

956
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:53,353
37 miles.

957
00:37:53,386 --> 00:37:55,288
The doctor says I'm never
gonna walk right again.

958
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:58,459
But some things are worth the sacrifice.

959
00:37:58,491 --> 00:38:00,293
So there's this guy at school,

960
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:02,228
um, he was supposed to meet me for it,

961
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:04,230
but he didn't show up.

962
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:07,801
And it's weird because I
really thought we had something.

963
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,737
I don't know. I like the guy but...

964
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,739
I guess moonwalking 37 miles

965
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:14,440
would be a pretty weird first date.

966
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:15,942
That was supposed to be a date?

967
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,945
Maybe he'll be at the party tonight,

968
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:20,781
and we'll see if there's something there.

969
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:24,217
Otherwise, I am totally fine

970
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,618
with talking to you three fine people

971
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:29,190
out in internet land,
until you get bored of me.

972
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,425
And also, I've prepared a statement

973
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:35,763
for those victims of Ring Finger Largeasia.

974
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:38,398
- [clear throat]
- Don't ignore me, Anthony.

975
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:40,868
Stop it! This is Anna Reed!

976
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,669
The girl I'm in love with.

977
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:45,639
The whole reason I came into
YouTube in the first place.

978
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,342
I think I just found out
she's in love with me, too.

979
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,976
(Diri) Wow, you're easy.

980
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:51,811
What is that supposed to mean?

981
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:53,680
(Diri) What does she
have that I don't have?

982
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:58,585
Uh, a body, and a face, for starters.

983
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:00,887
Sincerely, Anna Reed.

984
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,322
[thud]

985
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:03,823
(Diri) Let's get out of here.

986
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:05,659
Who's there?

987
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:11,732
Uh, Uncle Keith's ghost.

988
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:14,734
[moaning]

989
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:17,972
- Uncle Keith?
- We have to go now!

990
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,307
(Diri) You are never
going to find your video.

991
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,643
It is no wonder that Ian does
not value your friendship.

992
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:24,778
Of course he does.

993
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,712
(Diri) Oh, really?

994
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,415
[suspenseful music]

995
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:34,988
Uncle Keith was a furry?

996
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:40,494
Oh, man, this feels great.

997
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:43,831
Is it weird to say that I
want this guy's hand on my butt

998
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,632
all the time?

999
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:47,601
A little bit.

1000
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:53,840
Ian? What are you doing?

1001
00:39:53,873 --> 00:39:58,478
Oh, hey, man, check it
out! It's Butt Massage Girl.

1002
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,580
You were supposed to be out looking

1003
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:00,647
for the graduation night video!

1004
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,516
(Anthony) What happened?

1005
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:05,652
Maybe you didn't hear me,
but I found Butt Massage Girl.

1006
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:08,755
Dude, she's amazing. We're kind of in love.

1007
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:12,592
(Butt Massage Girl) Hey, I know
you. You're Backflip Microphone Guy.

1008
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,961
We've been watching your video all day.

1009
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:16,496
You showed her that?

1010
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:19,365
Well, I mean, it's a good video.

1011
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:20,500
(Ian) Why wouldn't I?

1012
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:21,869
I mean, there you go.

1013
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,371
- It's so cute, dude.
- It's so cute.

1014
00:40:24,404 --> 00:40:26,840
Oh, my God, dude, it's up to 748 views now.

1015
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,375
That's like the entire attendance

1016
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:31,078
of a football stadium
in a slightly bigger town

1017
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,879
with a high school team
whose record is like,

1018
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:34,447
- eight and two, and you know...
- This is why I like you.

1019
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,515
they started the season off as underdogs,

1020
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:36,784
so they, somehow, keep winning.

1021
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:38,052
They're selling tickets like crazy and...

1022
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:40,020
We get it, dude.

1023
00:40:40,052 --> 00:40:43,757
Ian, we have the video
address now. It's right here.

1024
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,326
We have to go now before
Anna sees the video.

1025
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,028
But... But, but, but, but, but,

1026
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,096
- Butt Massage Girl.
- This is serious, dude.

1027
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,734
It turns out, Anna is in love with me, too.

1028
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:55,069
Oh.

1029
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:59,739
But, but... Butt Massage Girl.

1030
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:01,607
We have to fix that video
and get to the reunion

1031
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:03,377
more now than ever. Come on!

1032
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:05,045
But I wanna stay here with her.

1033
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:08,549
Dude, it's meant to be, see?

1034
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,917
Ian, come on, man.

1035
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:14,521
This isn't even real. It's just a video.

1036
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:16,490
Our love is real.

1037
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:18,825
I mean, we got our butts massaged together.

1038
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,893
Look.

1039
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:22,629
[relaxing music]

1040
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:23,930
Butt Massage Girl?

1041
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:25,699
[screams]

1042
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:26,867
Who the hell are you?

1043
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,470
- It's me.
- You who?

1044
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:32,572
Big Rod 91.

1045
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:36,042
Oh, my goodness, it's really you?

1046
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,677
Yeah.

1047
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,545
Ian, I know this is hard,

1048
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:42,482
but we only have 24% of
our battery life left.

1049
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:46,487
Okay? We need to go now.

1050
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,955
All right. Fine.

1051
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:49,623
But, Big Rod 91...

1052
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:51,391
Good-bye, Butt Massage Girl.

1053
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:52,392

Aw...

1231
00:48:12,105 --> 00:48:14,840
Look at the cute little kitty!

1232
00:48:14,873 --> 00:48:16,475
- [cat purrs]
- Hey, little guy!

1233
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:18,478
[grunting, yelling]

1234
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:24,283
Wait!
B-b-bucket...

1235
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,119
Whoa... whoa...

1236
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:31,223
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1237
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:32,826
Dude, seriously?

1238
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:34,261
Damn it!

1239
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:35,328
Sorry. Please don't hurt us.

1240
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,962
Aah!

1241
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:39,465
[scream echoing]

1242
00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:41,100
Okay, look, you're right.

1243
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:42,402
I have been a jerk lately.

1244
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:44,371
I know I should have come clean right away

1245
00:48:44,404 --> 00:48:45,505
about the video, but...

1246
00:48:45,538 --> 00:48:47,107
once I saw your reaction to it,

1247
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:48,475
I knew you'd be pissed.

1248
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:51,011
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

1249
00:48:51,043 --> 00:48:53,346
(Diri) Why don't you guys make out already?

1250
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:55,047
Anthony, let's get out of here.

1251
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:57,918
- Screw this guy.
- Diri, can you just shut up?

1252
00:48:57,951 --> 00:49:00,219
Okaaaaay, graduates!

1253
00:49:00,252 --> 00:49:02,254
Helloooo!

1254
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:04,891
Are we all having a good time tonight?

1255
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:07,527
Lame! We hate you.

1256
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,527
Okay.

1257
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,263
You know what?

1258
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,131
I'm gonna make this up to you.

1259
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:14,601
I got you into this mess, and
I'm gonna get you out of it.

1260
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:16,269
Wait... where are you going?

1261
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:17,904
(Diri) Let him go.

1262
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:21,007
It's just you and me now, Dreamy Eyes.

1263
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,509
What did you just call me?

1264
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,946
(Diri) You heard me, you sexy little bitch.

1265
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:27,980
(Mr. Ellis) Put your
hands together for Anthony.

1266
00:49:28,014 --> 00:49:29,449
Anthony Padillo!

1267
00:49:29,482 --> 00:49:31,150
Give him a hand.

1268
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:34,286
Thanks, Mr. Ellis.

1269
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,455
You rock, Anthony.

1270
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,022
Is <i>Magic Pocket Slave Monster</i>

1271
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:38,425
the best song ever?

1272
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,593
[pops lips]

1273
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:43,163
Hey, you got up here really fast.

1274
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:44,630
I'm sorry, man.

1275
00:49:44,663 --> 00:49:47,333
[crowd commotion]

1276
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:52,172
[Anthony grunting]

1277
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:53,340
Ouch! Ow! Ow!

1278
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:54,474
What are you trying to do?

1279
00:49:54,507 --> 00:49:56,142
I'm trying to knock you out

1280
00:49:56,174 --> 00:49:57,977
so you don't embarrass yourself.

1281
00:49:58,011 --> 00:49:59,346
Huh?

1282
00:49:59,378 --> 00:50:01,214
Told you I don't go down that easy.

1283
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,887
[students murmuring]

1284
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,288
- Here you go.
- Thanks!

1285
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:09,489
[brick shatters]

1286
00:50:09,522 --> 00:50:12,125
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

1287
00:50:12,157 --> 00:50:14,326
Either I'm seeing what you're seeing,

1288
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,429
or somebody spiked the punch bowl with LSD.

1289
00:50:16,462 --> 00:50:18,398
It's not. I made the
punch, and I only spiked it

1290
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:19,599
with vodka.

1291
00:50:19,632 --> 00:50:20,967
What should I do?

1292
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,335
Should I go up there and help him?

1293
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:24,904
That's what a good
friend would do, I guess.

1294
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,973
You're right.

1295
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:29,509
How are you so tough to knock out, man?

1296
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:32,212
Is your head made of steel?

1297
00:50:32,244 --> 00:50:33,980
[grunting continues]

1298
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:36,482
Give it to him!

1299
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:38,485
Stop hitting my friend!

1300
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,286
Aah!

1301
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,489
[grunting, shouting]

1302
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,591
- [rock music]
- Fight!

1303
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,360
[screaming]

1304
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,295
Fight, fight, fight!

1305
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:51,096
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1306
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,532
- [students yelling]
- [girl screams]

1307
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:55,034
Fight!

1308
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:03,209
[screams]

1309
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:12,719
[grunting]

1310
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:16,589
- Come on!
- [phone beeps]

1311
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:18,223
Ian, look!

1312
00:51:18,257 --> 00:51:19,392
We only have 5% power left.

1313
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:20,526
We have to get out of here.

1314
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,161
What about fixing the video?

1315
00:51:22,194 --> 00:51:24,263
Forget it, it's too late.

1316
00:51:24,297 --> 00:51:26,499
Diri, get us to the portal now.

1317
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:29,168
(Diri) You said, "Is my Mom infertile?"

1318
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:30,970
Let me check on that for you.

1319
00:51:31,003 --> 00:51:33,540
That's not what I said! You
know that's not what I said.

1320
00:51:33,572 --> 00:51:36,076
Damn it, Diri, this is not
the time for games, okay?

1321
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:38,411
If we don't get back to that portal now,

1322
00:51:38,444 --> 00:51:40,714
we're gonna be stuck
here in YouTube forever.

1323
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:42,014
(Diri) And you would just hate that,

1324
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:43,482
wouldn't you?

1325
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:45,585
Stuck in here with me
for the rest of your life.

1326
00:51:45,618 --> 00:51:48,087
Shut up, Diri, this isn't about you.

1327
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:49,522
(Diri) You shut up, Ian.

1328
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:52,091
You have poisoned the
mind of my dear Anthony.

1329
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,592
What is it with you guys?

1330
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,261
First, you idiots barge into
my office off the street,

1331
00:51:56,295 --> 00:51:58,164
asking for favors.

1332
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:01,167
I am gracious enough to listen,
but then you won't even laugh

1333
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,103
at my wiener jokes, even
though they are super funny.

1334
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:07,139
Wait. Steve... is that you?

1335
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:10,609
Uh... no, this is Diri.

1336
00:52:10,643 --> 00:52:14,347
I'm just some computer software
guiding you guys around.

1337
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,282
I'm definitely not Steve
YouTube, whoever that is.

1338
00:52:17,315 --> 00:52:20,052
I mean, I've heard of
Steve YouTube, of course.

1339
00:52:20,085 --> 00:52:22,755
[in Diri's voice] His
wiener comedy is legendary.

1340
00:52:22,788 --> 00:52:26,025
Steve, dude, we know it's you, okay?

1341
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:28,494
All right, fine. It's me, Steve.

1342
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:30,397
YouTube... Steve YouTube.

1343
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:32,065
Too bad you didn't figure
it out and hour ago,

1344
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:33,465
because now I've got you trapped.

1345
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:35,334
You're gonna live forever in YouTube,

1346
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:38,071
making jackasses of yourselves in videos.

1347
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:40,607
People love watching
jackasses doing stupid things.

1348
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:42,741
It's our bread and butter here at YouTube.

1349
00:52:42,775 --> 00:52:45,078
And now, you're mine forever.

1350
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,513
I knew that guy was a weirdo.

1351
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:47,714
You're the weirdo!

1352
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:49,248
We have to get back to that portal.

1353
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:51,650
Anna is waiting for me on the other side.

1354
00:52:51,683 --> 00:52:52,819
Good luck trying to find the portal

1355
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:54,520
without me to lead you there.

1356
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:55,555
It's impossible.

1357
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:57,389
Hoo hoo hah hah hah!

1358
00:52:57,422 --> 00:52:59,691
[coughing] Hold on.

1359
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:01,226
Wait, I have an idea.

1360
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:02,428
What if we went into the viewing history

1361
00:53:02,462 --> 00:53:04,364
and followed the videos backwards?

1362
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,299
That should lead us back
to the portal, right?

1363
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:08,134
No, that won't work.

1364
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:09,268
I mean, that definitely
won't work, I wouldn't even...

1365
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:11,137
don't even try that.

1366
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,505
We have to try the viewing
history, it's the only chance

1367
00:53:12,538 --> 00:53:13,505
we've got... come on!

1368
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:15,374
You are gonna regret this.

1369
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:17,543
You are messing with the wrong
super successful billionaire.

1370
00:53:17,576 --> 00:53:18,578
- [thud]
- Oh!

1371
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,647
Found it.

1372
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:22,514
Let's go.

1373
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:26,118
Fine, you want to run from
me? I'm up for the challenge.

1374
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:28,821
- Here we go.
- [beep]

1375
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:29,822
- That's not it.
- [beep]

1376
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:31,090
That's not it.

1377
00:53:31,123 --> 00:53:32,558
Is that it? Oh... there it is.

1378
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,528
There it is.

1379
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:39,699
- Let's do this.
- [alarm sounds]

1380
00:53:39,732 --> 00:53:41,067
Jerks.

1381
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:47,740
[electric charging]

1382
00:53:47,772 --> 00:53:50,242
All right.

1383
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:52,212
I gotta get my VR suit on.

1384
00:53:52,244 --> 00:53:53,712
Oh! Shoot me... ow.

1385
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:56,116
My thigh.

1386
00:53:56,148 --> 00:53:59,319
All right, I'm just gonna
get my VR suit... oh, shoot.

1387
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:02,321
Hold on, guys. Guys...
I just dropped my globe.

1388
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:04,791
I just got a little
bit turned around, guys.

1389
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:07,527
Got it.

1390
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,594
Don't go anywhere.

1391
00:54:08,627 --> 00:54:10,462
Oh, Jesus. There it is.

1392
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:12,398
My VR suit is in here.

1393
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:15,168
Soon as I put that on, you're dead.

1394
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:17,704
So I just gotta change
out of these clothes,

1395
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,240
get my VR suit on, then
I'm gonna need a zip.

1396
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:23,342
Janice? I'm gonna need a zip!

1397
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,610
I'm putting the VR suit on,

1398
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:26,312
and I'm gonna need a zip in a second.

1399
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,581
Whoa.

1400
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:30,716
Aw.

1401
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,786
Aw, look at the cute little whiskers.

1402
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:34,786
[both scream]

1403
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:35,821
Jesus.

1404
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,891
Kaboom! [laughs]

1405
