816
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,282
   Professor Hill.

817
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:32,985
   Professor of what?

818
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,423
 At what college do they give
 a degree for annoying women
 on the street

819
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:38,360
 like a Saturday night rowdy
 at a public dance hall?

820
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:40,364
  Well, I wouldn't know
  about that.

821
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:43,703
 I'm a conservatory man myself.
 Gary, Indiana, Gold Medal
 Class of aught-five.

822
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:49,739
 Even should that happen
 to be true,

823
00:43:49,784 --> 00:43:52,010
 does that give you the
 right to follow me around
 wherever I go?

824
00:43:52,054 --> 00:43:53,146
 Another thing, Mr. Hill,

825
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:56,949
 I'm not as easily
 mesmerized or hoodwinked

826
00:43:56,994 --> 00:43:58,754
 as some people in this town

827
00:43:58,795 --> 00:44:00,355
 and I think it only fair
 to warn you

828
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,994
 that I have a shelf full
 of reference books
 in my library

829
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:04,829
 which may very well
 give me some interesting
 information about you.

830
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:24,289
 Hey, Greg!

831
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,427
 Hi, Marcellus.
 Don't call me Greg.

832
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:31,731
So how'd you make out
with the music teacher?

833
00:44:31,773 --> 00:44:33,432
 Ate out of my hand
 the minute I tipped my hat.

834
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:37,271
 She did? Oh, boy,
 did you cut a swath today.

835
00:44:37,315 --> 00:44:38,875
 For a minute
 even I thought

836
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,476
  you knew somethin'
  about leadin' a band.

837
00:44:40,518 --> 00:44:42,044
 Just like when you
 used to imitate

838
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:42,780
  that band-concert
  fellow in Joplin.

839
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:44,182
   Yeah.

840
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:46,352
 Ah, kid stuff.

841
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,220
   I'm in rare form these days.

842
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,853
  Just keep your eyes on me
  for the next three weeks.

843
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,422
Three weeks?

844
00:44:51,465 --> 00:44:53,858
 It only used to take ten days
 for the instruments to arrive.

845
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:54,994
  Still does. But it takes
  three weeks for the uniforms.

846
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,432
Oh, no, Greg.

847
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,871
 You haven't added uniforms?

848
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:01,373
 Uniforms and
 instruction books.

849
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:04,010
 Instruction books?

850
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:06,780
 But, you can't pass yourself
 off as a music professor.

851
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:08,511
 I mean not for
 any three weeks.

852
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:08,511
   Marce.

853
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:10,480
 But you don't know
 one note from another.

854
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,917
 I have a revolutionary
 new method called
 the "Think System"

855
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,186
 where you don't bother
 with notes.

856
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:14,954
  But in three weeks...

857
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:20,530
 Why that's the Fourth
 of July sociable.

858
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:22,132
 The people will want
 to hear music.

859
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:23,500
 You'll have to
 lead a band.

860
00:45:23,543 --> 00:45:25,570
   When the uniforms arrive
   they forget all that,

861
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:28,574
   at least long enough
   for me to collect and leave.

862
00:45:28,617 --> 00:45:31,412
  Oh, this is a refined
  operation, Marce,
  and I've got it timed

863
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:33,844
right down to the last wave
of the brakeman's hand

01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:34,285
He has.

1301
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:35,219
And I hope
not forever.

1302
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,926
  Darlin', don't you ever think
  about your future?

1304
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,233
   Now darlin'...

1305
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,233
 Now Mama,

1306
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:47,336
   surely a girl's future
   doesn't depend
   on encouraging

1307
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:49,639
   every fast-talking,
   self-centered,

1308
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,641
 woman-chasing, traveling man
 who comes to town.

1309
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:54,942
 And the fact that
 he claims his commodity
 is music does not,

1310
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:57,880
 in this particular case,
 impress me.

1311
01:07:57,927 --> 01:07:58,885
   All right, darlin',
   all right.

1312
01:08:00,364 --> 01:08:02,356
 Only it's a well-known
 principle

1313
01:08:02,398 --> 01:08:04,159
that if you keep
the flint in one drawer

1314
01:08:04,201 --> 01:08:05,726
  and the steel in another,

1315
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:06,663
you'll never strike
much of a fire.

1322

It's a book, the <i> Indiana State

  You won't have to

 What do you need
 with another book?

1329
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,146
 I have a feeling
 this book may poke

1330
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,349
 some large holes
 in the Professor's claims.

1331
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,051

 It still has a couple
 of minor flaws.

1396
01:12:55,585 --> 01:12:57,979
 See, when you keep it
 tight enough
 to hold the music steady,

1397
01:12:58,021 --> 01:12:59,747
 you cut off the circulation
 and you can't wiggle
 your fingers.

  you could go blind.

01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:24,271
Okay.

1626
01:23:31,021 --> 01:23:32,181
  Thank you.

1627
01:23:32,225 --> 01:23:33,217
 Now you enjoy yourself.

1628
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:35,983
Excuse me.

1629
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:39,052
Hello, Miss Marian.

1630
01:23:39,095 --> 01:23:41,088
   Thanks for the sarsaparilla,
   Professor, and the talk.

1631
01:23:41,132 --> 01:23:43,193
  Miss Marian.

1632
01:23:43,237 --> 01:23:46,532
 Professor Hill,
 I think Mayor Shinn
 has behaved abominably,

1633
01:23:46,574 --> 01:23:48,601
 and I just wanted to say

1634
01:23:48,645 --> 01:23:51,440
 it was wonderful of you
 coming to Tommy's defense
 back there.

1635
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,541
  Oh, that was nothing.

1636
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,541
 Oh, yes it was.

1637
01:23:53,582 --> 01:23:55,275
   Oh, no, no.

1638
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:56,579
   A man can't dodge
   the issue

1639
01:23:56,621 --> 01:23:58,881
 every time a little
 personal risk is involved.

1640
01:23:58,923 --> 01:24:00,850
 What does
 the poet say?

1641
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:01,851
 "A coward dies
 a thousand deaths,

1642
01:24:02,529 --> 01:24:03,489
"the brave man only

1643
01:24:04,265 --> 01:24:05,191
   "500."

1644
01:24:08,235 --> 01:24:10,529
  Unfortunately, of course,
  the Mayor was already
  pretty mad at me

1645
01:24:10,573 --> 01:24:11,632
   on account of
   his billiard parlor.

1646
01:24:11,675 --> 01:24:14,436
Now...

1647
01:24:14,476 --> 01:24:17,003
   Oh, I suppose
   a recommendation
   from a musical authority

1648
01:24:17,046 --> 01:24:18,005
  such as yourself
  would help but...

1649
01:24:20,487 --> 01:24:22,579
 I couldn't think of asking you
 to do a thing like that.

1650
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:24,315
 Why not?

1651
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:24,315
   You mean, you would?

1652
01:24:24,358 --> 01:24:25,150
  I'd be glad to.

1653
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:27,552
 I just wish I was
 a little more informed.

1654
01:24:30,096 --> 01:24:32,190
 I've been wanting
 to talk to you
 about Winthrop's cornet.

1655
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,025
  His cornet?
  Mother-of-pearl keys.

1656
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,429
 Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

1657
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,297
It's just that
he never touches it.

1658
01:24:37,341 --> 01:24:40,169
 Oh, the first week or so,
 he made a few experimental,

1659
01:24:40,212 --> 01:24:42,172
 uh, blats,
 I guess you'd say?

1660
01:24:42,216 --> 01:24:43,076
   Yes, yes, blats.

1661
01:24:44,985 --> 01:24:47,313
 And he sings the <i> Minuet in G</i>
 almost constantly.

1662
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:50,318
 <i> ♪ La de da de</i>
 <i> da de da de da</i>
 <i> La de da ♪</i>

1663
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,386
But he never touches
the cornet.

1664
01:24:53,961 --> 01:24:56,186
   Yes, well...

1665
01:24:53,961 --> 01:24:56,186
 He says you told him
 it wasn't necessary.

1666
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:58,423
  Well...

1667
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:58,423
 He tells me about some
 "Think System."

1668
01:24:58,466 --> 01:25:00,059
 If he thinks
 the <i> Minuet in G,</i>

1669
01:25:00,104 --> 01:25:01,497
 he won't have to bother
 with the notes.

1670
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:03,233
 Now, Professor...

1671
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:03,233
 Miss Marian,

1672
01:25:03,275 --> 01:25:06,570
 the Think System
 is a revolutionary method,
 I'll admit.

1673
01:25:06,613 --> 01:25:09,475
 But, so was Galileo's
 conception of the Heavens,

1674
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:10,443
   Columbus' conception
   of the egg,

1675
01:25:11,152 --> 01:25:13,613
uh, globe,

1676
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:15,615
  Bach's conception
  of the Well-Tempered
  Clavichord. Hmm?

1677
01:25:15,658 --> 01:25:17,451
  Hmm.

1678
01:25:17,493 --> 01:25:19,720
   Oh, now I cannot discuss
   these things here in public,

1679
01:25:19,762 --> 01:25:21,122
but if you'll
allow me to call.

1680
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:23,493
  When may I call?

1681
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,695
 Why, any night
 this week.

01:31:53,113 --> 01:31:56,242

  things get to be
  a habit with people.

  You think a person
  might change, but they don't.

1812
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:02,551
 You think a person
 might let herself go,
 might speak her heart,

1813

   but she don't.

1814
01:32:04,096 --> 01:32:05,655

 to call again,
 you see him alone

01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,606
 and if you haven't
 the gumption to tell him
 how you feel...

1823
01:32:20,649 --> 01:32:22,609
   Tell him?

1824
01:32:22,653 --> 01:32:24,980

 He said he'd
 take me there someday.

 And he never will!

1914
01:36:06,314 --> 01:36:08,240
  If you'll just listen
  to me for a minute.

1915
01:36:08,284 --> 01:36:10,345

to do a lot more than that,

   No, sir. I've got to
   leave word.

  the one to leave it with.

 who sells anvils.

01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:37,448

  Uh, quite different.

 I can tell you that much.

1931
01:36:46,099 --> 01:36:47,358
 Anvils have a limited
 appeal, you know...

1932
01:36:47,402 --> 01:36:49,061
 I... What am I doin'?

1933
01:36:49,104 --> 01:36:51,331
 If I miss that train,
 I'm fired!

1934
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:53,068

 about that fellow Hill!

1935
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:54,135
   Leave word with me.

1936
01:36:54,177 --> 01:36:55,604

1937
01:36:55,646 --> 01:36:56,572

   deliver these letters?

01:36:56,615 --> 01:36:57,576

 (MRS. PAROO EXCLAIMS)

1950
01:37:42,173 --> 01:37:45,569
Oh, my goodness,
I just remembered, I've got
some jelly on the stove!

1951
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,470
There's no jelly
on the stove, Mama.

1952
01:37:47,515 --> 01:37:49,242
   Well, I'll just put some on.

1953
01:37:50,252 --> 01:37:51,679
 You just come up here and set.

1954
01:38:01,162 --> 01:38:03,089
 Shall we "set"
 as your mother said?

1955
01:38:03,131 --> 01:38:04,257
   What are you doing here?

1956
01:38:04,301 --> 01:38:06,394
 You asked me to call.

1957
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:09,601
Did I? I didn't
mean anything.

1958
01:38:09,643 --> 01:38:12,505
 No, no, I wasn't
 suggesting that your
 invitation inferred anything,

1959
01:38:12,547 --> 01:38:13,640
 but academic enlightenment,

1960
01:38:15,284 --> 01:38:18,046
 the Think System.

1961
01:38:18,088 --> 01:38:20,416
 I've been by your house
 to try to explain it to you
 a time or two this week,

1962
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:22,685
 but there always seemed
 to be people around.

1963
01:38:22,726 --> 01:38:24,420
 Mostly ladies, I thought.

1964
01:38:24,462 --> 01:38:27,692
 Yes, Mrs. Squires
 and several of the ladies.

1965
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:29,695
 I'm glad. Wouldn't want
 anybody beating my time.

1966
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:35,368
  Well, it's evidently
  not the convenient time.

1967
01:38:38,215 --> 01:38:40,376
   Professor Hill!

1968
01:38:40,417 --> 01:38:41,576
 Is it true that you've
 had 100...

1969
01:38:44,657 --> 01:38:46,050
What I'm trying
to say is...

1970
01:38:46,528 --> 01:38:47,354
  Yes?

1971
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:50,756
 Is it really true that
 you've developed a...

1972
01:38:52,497 --> 01:38:54,257
 A Think System?

1973
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:56,361
   Absolutely.

1974
01:38:56,404 --> 01:38:59,133
   It's really very simple,
   as simple as whistling.

1975
01:38:59,176 --> 01:39:02,171
No one has to show
you how to use
your lips in whistling.

1976
01:39:02,212 --> 01:39:04,305
 You only have to
 think a tune to have
 it come out clearly...

1977
01:39:04,347 --> 01:39:05,274
Here.

1978
01:39:08,122 --> 01:39:10,049
 Now just try
 this yourself, before
 you ask any questions.

1979
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:16,125
  I take your word.

1980
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:17,794
  (SIGHS)

1981
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:24,229

1982
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:24,229
 Are all music teachers
 as dense as I am?

1983
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:26,233

1984
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:26,233
 I daresay you meet dozens...

1985
01:39:26,278 --> 01:39:28,271
   Even a hundred.

1986
01:39:28,314 --> 01:39:31,109
Well, I...

1987
01:39:28,314 --> 01:39:31,109
 Have they all been
 fascinated as I have with...

1988
01:39:31,152 --> 01:39:31,778
   The Think System?

1989
01:39:33,386 --> 01:39:36,215
  Some more, some less.

1990
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,653
  One young lady thought up
  the same system
  before I got to her town.

1991
01:39:38,862 --> 01:39:40,688
 She showed me
 a few refinements.

1992
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:41,722
I see.

1993
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:45,194
   Have I said something wrong?

1994
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:46,595
 Please don't let me
 keep you, Professor Hill.

1995
01:39:46,637 --> 01:39:48,832
 You must have many more
 important things to do

1996
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,367
 than explain the
 Think System to me.

1997
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:52,104
Can't think of one.

1998
01:39:52,145 --> 01:39:55,173
 And I must be
 very dull company for
 a man of your experience.

1999
01:39:55,216 --> 01:39:57,545
  Now, say, where'd you get
  an idea like that?

2000
01:39:59,587 --> 01:40:00,814
  One hears rumors
  of traveling salesmen.

2001
01:40:02,592 --> 01:40:03,519
   What have you heard?

2002
01:40:06,298 --> 01:40:08,659
 Oh, nothing, nothing about you
 personally, just generally.

2003
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:11,329
 What have you heard generally?

2004
01:40:11,368 --> 01:40:13,496
 Just that,

2005
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:17,234
 but of course, it stands to
 reason that disappointment
 and jealousy can lead to,

2006
01:40:17,278 --> 01:40:20,340
 to, I mean,
 take you for instance,

2007
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,908
 your attention to,
 to, to customers

2008
01:40:22,952 --> 01:40:26,381
 and, and, and well, teachers,

2009
01:40:26,426 --> 01:40:28,620
 might easily be
 misinterpreted, mightn't they?

2010
01:40:28,662 --> 01:40:30,454
 I mean, now honestly,
 mightn't they?

2011
01:40:30,497 --> 01:40:31,923
   Why?

2012
01:40:30,497 --> 01:40:31,923
 And, so you say,
 if another

2013
01:40:31,966 --> 01:40:34,193
 salesman or someone
 were jealous,

2014
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:35,195
   I mean...

2015
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:38,897
 Well, they could be
 downright lies, couldn't they?

2016
01:40:38,938 --> 01:40:40,530
What could?

2017
01:40:38,938 --> 01:40:40,530
 Rumors and things.

2018
01:40:41,707 --> 01:40:44,335
Why, of course.

2019
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,340
 It just proves that you
 can't believe everything
 you hear, doesn't it?

2020
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:47,208
I mean...

2021
01:40:48,353 --> 01:40:50,445
 If you just
 discuss things.

2022
01:40:50,488 --> 01:40:53,851
  Miss Marian, I would be
  delighted to discuss anything
  in the world with you.

2023
01:40:53,895 --> 01:40:55,455
 But couldn't we do
 it sitting down?

2024
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:58,757
 You do sit?

2025
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,726
  Your knees
  bend and all.

2026
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:03,363
   We could sit
   on the porch steps.

2027
01:41:03,404 --> 01:41:05,632
We could also sit
on the large hollow log
over't the footbridge.

2028
01:41:06,777 --> 01:41:08,570
 Oh, I couldn't think of it.

2029
01:41:08,613 --> 01:41:09,639
  I've never been
  to the footbridge
  with a man in my life.

2030
01:41:10,782 --> 01:41:11,675
  Just to talk.

2031
01:41:13,654 --> 01:41:15,881
 I just can't, please,
 some other time.

2032
01:41:15,922 --> 01:41:17,582
 Maybe tomorrow.

2033
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,484
  My dear little librarian,

2034
01:41:19,693 --> 01:41:21,653
   pile up enough tomorrows

2035
01:41:21,697 --> 01:41:26,228
 and you'll find
 you've collected nothing
 but a lot of empty yesterdays.

2036
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:27,963
 I don't know about you,
 but I'd like to make today
 worth remembering.

2037
01:41:30,338 --> 01:41:31,431
So would I.

   that you were about,
