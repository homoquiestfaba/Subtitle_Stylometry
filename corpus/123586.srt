1
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,171
Those days were amazing.

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,926
Being a kid, you know, what else was I
to do but to live the Dragon?

3
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,805
I'd study the music note for note.
I read every interview.

4
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,017
Copied every outfit, every move,
you know, every look.

5
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,521
<i>My pursuit of perfection</i>
<i>was relentless.</i>

6
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,525
<i>The music deserved that.</i>

7
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,111
<i>All right, ladies. Spread them.</i>

8
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,056
Rob, you're not nailing the squeal.

9
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,893
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

10
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,395
Check it out.

11
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,365
Play it like that.

12
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,078
That's it.
That's a ping, not a squeal.

13
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,082
- Sounds just like the tape, man.
- No. Raunchier.

14
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,085
Again, please.

15
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,756
That was great. Thank you.

16
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,758
From the top.

17
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,009
Hold on!

18
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,492
Hey, Jeremy, no.

19
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,704
What are you doing?
You know what this is?

20
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:28,834
<i>Lubricator,</i> signed by all five
band members with the original cover.

21
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:32,546
Look. Jorgen's name is misspelled.
It should be an "E."

22
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,007
You know how much I can get for it?

23
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,094
Peace to you too, dude.
Try it like this.

24
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,107
Mom?
Mom, isn't my room off-limits?

25
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:56,445
I'm sorry, Chris.
Oh, what were you doing?

26
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,574
- How are you?
- Good. How's Willard?

27
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,035
- He's fine. You look nice.
- Thank you.

28
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,079
Here, hold on.
You got a smudge.

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,999
- Bye. Gotta run.
- Bye. Love you.

30
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,460
Love you too. Bye.

31
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,397
I need more power! I want more!

32
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,847
Come on, come on.

33
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,895
Nina and Samantha!

34
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,148
Hey, Chris.

35
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,361
- Coming to my show in a week?
- Of course.

36
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,739
- Want to hand out fliers?
- Absolutely.

37
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,116
- You guys look awesome.
- Bye.

38
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,535
We're a band called Blood Pollution...

39
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,289
a Steel Dragon tribute band,
the best in Pittsburgh.

40
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,315
Thank you.

41
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,320
I wrote this one for someone
who ripped out my heart.

42
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,822
And put it through a bloody blender!

43
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,449
That's right.

44
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,958
This one's for Kim, who makes me
want to stand up and shout.

45
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,777
Em, I'll be right back, okay?

46
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,572
Excuse me.

47
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,123
You think I could have one?

48
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,587
Not without a blowjob and a sex
change, pal. But have a nice day.

49
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,758
- Come on, girls. This way.
- See you, Chris.

50
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,152
Oh, that was awesome!

51
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,322
That was the heaviest
since Columbus in '77.

52
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,367
Heavier than the <i>Demented</i> tour.

53
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,622
- I ask you, did they not rock?
- They totally rocked.

54
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,967
Guys.

55
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,805
What the...?

56
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,106
Come on.

57
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,526
Oh, I thought I smelled pussy.

58
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,361
Look who's here.

59
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:34,157
- If it isn't Yoko Ono and the Fag Five.
- What are you doing?

60
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,536
Making sure nobody sees
some cut-rate copy band.

61
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,039
Cut-rate? This dude can't
even tune his own guitar.

62
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,877
- You could work on your lip-synch.
- I don't lip-synch.

63
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,880
Be doing everyone a favor if you did.

64
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,007
You could get the outfit right.

65
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,136
Boots from the <i>Wasted</i> tour
and a cheap <i>Twisted</i> jacket.

66
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:59,016
You are so fully wrong, cocksmoker.
This is official issue.

67
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,519
The actual vest Bobby wore
on the <i>Twisted</i> tour.

68
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,480
My dad bought it from someone
who knows them.

69
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,525
Sorry, but your dad got ripped.

70
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,280
The lapels should be blue,
there's no green in the embroidery.

71
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,742
As a matter of fact,
can anybody here honestly say...

72
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,205
they've ever seen Bobby Beers
with a jacket with red lapels?

73
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,373
- No, I can't.
- I don't think so.

74
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,417
You can make me his pants.

75
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,086
Or did she already rip out
the Dodge seats?

76
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:33,050
No. First tell me what you put there
to make people think you're a guy.

77
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,803
- This is all me, baby.
- You and a few ballet slippers.

78
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,097
- You want a piece of me?
- No, I'm good.

79
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,434
- Want to see how a real man...
- Don't touch her.

80
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,899
- Let go of my cape.
- Let go of my cape!

81
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,266
Get your ass out of bed.

82
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,145
Get out of here.

83
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,650
- Let's go. Get up.
- Get out of here.

84
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,151
Move it.

85
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,366
Where you hiding
your stash these days?

86
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,577
Get out! I didn't do anything.

87
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,663
That's the problem.
You never do anything.

88
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,417
- Get out of here, pig!
- God... Fucking...

89
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,378
Come on!

90
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,214
Mom! Mom!

91
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:03,182
Jeez, boys. Quit. Break it up.
Chris, give him a break. Come on.

92
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,475
- Stop it!
- Tell him to get out!

93
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,477
- Used to be my room.
- Not anymore!

94
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,022
Because I moved out when I was 18.

95
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,649
- We're having breakfast.
- Keep him out!

96
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,195
Get ready for work.
Will you go downstairs?

97
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,198
- Keep him out!
- All right, he's gone.

98
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,996
So you arrested Mervin
for drunk driving?

99
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,415
He was parked on
the Brennemans' lawn.

100
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,085
Claims he was going out for ice cream.
Same story.

101
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,423
- Chris, so how was the show?
- It was fine.

102
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:40,511
- The freaks were out in force.
- Why weren't you busting heads?

103
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,847
- Female officers handle that crowd.
- You want to go?

104
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:47,351
- Come on.
- Saved again. Should take her to work.

105
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,728
- Good one.
- Did they do "Black Babylon"?

106
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,106
They haven't played that
since Osaka in '75.

107
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,568
- That is pathetic that you know.
- I love that song.

108
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,197
Okay, genius,
who's buried in Grant's tomb?

109
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:05,118
It's twisted that you're still living
at home, stealing Ma's makeup.

110
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,954
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?

111
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,790
How much longer will you
put up with this?

112
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:14,127
The rock star fantasy thing is
something you grow out of at 14.

113
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:19,424
If I get lucky, I'll get to grow up
and listen to Air Supply like you.

114
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,969
What's wrong with Air Supply?

115
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,763
Nothing, if you're
from the Village People.

116
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,932
You know what the sickest thing
is about you?

117
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,894
It's that you don't have
any fantasies of your own.

118
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,605
You fantasize about
being somebody else.

119
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:38,235
Wearing somebody else's clothes.
Singing somebody else's songs.

120
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,237
It's pathetic.

121
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,534
- Get a haircut.
- Okay, Satan's allegiant.

122
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,160
Have a good one, son.

123
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,289
- You didn't eat.
- Later. I love you guys.

124
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,623
Love you too.

125
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,334
- I love you.
- You do this every time.

126
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,795
I question his sexuality, Ma. I do.

127
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,930
Here's the procedure, so it won't
happen again. Don't stick a pen in.

128
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,100
I'll give you a simple
one-two-three procedure.

129
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,229
It's 1-2-3.
Pop that down, push this.

130
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:18,734
Pull back on this lever, free up
the jam and you can access...

131
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,155
Is there something wrong?

132
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,490
Is that mascara?

133
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,203
- I'm in a band. Okay?
- Oh, okay.

134
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,873
Can you follow the 1-2-3
without sticking a pen in there?

135
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,666
Thank you.

136
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,293
Thank you very much.

137
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,545
Bye-bye.

138
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,918
Sorry about that.

139
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,345
When's Marci getting back?

140
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,391
She and Rob went to see Wham!
Won't be back for a while.

141
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,269
Wham!? Oh, God.

142
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,565
George Michael's a wuss.
I'm gonna give Rob shit for it.

143
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,192
He'll want to cover that.

144
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,444
All right, you.

145
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,240
Okay, now just relax.

146
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,665
- Is it numb?
- I think so.

147
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,625
Feel that?

148
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,642
- Sure you want to do this?
- Yeah, Bobby did it last week.

149
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,528
- I love you, babe.
- I love you.

150
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,663
Okay, don't look. Don't look.

151
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,928
- God, that had to hurt.
- Yes, it does. Oh, God.

152
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,737
You want to do the other one?

153
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:12,366
No. You want to do yours?

154
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,911
- Maybe.
- Come on. Let's do yours.

155
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,129
Testing, testing. One, two.

156
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,056
- No way!
- That's right. That's my boy.

157
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,892
All right, ladies,
who had the weenies?

158
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,531
Do I have too much foundation on?

159
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,785
I keep putting this shit on
till I want to fuck myself.

160
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,206
- Hey, Rob, you wearing underwear?
- No.

161
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,333
Rob.

162
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,170
You know the drill. No panties.

163
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,715
- Get up.
- I am not freezing my balls...

164
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,758
Just stand up and drop it.

165
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,178
- I'm not taking it off.
- Come on.

166
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:18,056
If you want, take them off.
I am not taking off...

167
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,270
Your woman's an animal!

168
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,944
All right!

169
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,406
Before we get too into this party.

170
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,241
- I love you!
- Love you too.

171
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,038
Before we get too deep into this party,
I want to thank Key Steel...

172
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:45,417
for letting us use their place
of business to pay tribute...

173
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:50,380
to the metal created by
none other than Steel Dragon!

174
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,093
And a special thanks
to my brother, Joe...

175
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:59,264
who gave me my first Dragon
record because he hated it.

176
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,188
And to my parents, because they
let me play it as loud as I wanted!

177
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,816
- That's my boy!
- That's my baby!

178
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,985
Because they rock!

179
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,284
Now, this next tune...

180
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,289
I’d like to dedicate to someone
who, when I first met...

181
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:28,794
ripped my heart out
and put it through a bloody blender.

182
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,048
That's right! This one's for Emily!

183
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,469
She turns me up and shakes me
down and makes me want to what?

184
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,471
Stand up and shout!

185
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,192
What was that?

186
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,861
What was what?

187
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,156
There's no solo break
after the chorus.

188
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,367
They don't care.

189
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,119
That's not how the song goes.

190
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,747
I know how the song goes.

191
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,875
If you know how it goes,
then play it right.

192
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:36,255
Chris, you are taking this shit
too seriously.

193
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:40,759
That's right, because the music
deserves to be taken seriously.

194
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,304
If you don't,
you don't deserve to play it.

195
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,307
All right, you need to get a grip.

196
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:51,478
You've ruined your performance.
Do not ruin mine!

197
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,299
Hey!

198
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,388
Plug that fucker back in.

199
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,209
Quit it!

200
00:22:56,126 --> 00:23:00,547
- That's my amp!
- Do not ruin this concert! Do not!

201
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,799
Hey, fuck this concert!

202
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,765
Here we go again.

203
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:22,319
- Hit him in the bollocks.
- That wraps it up for tonight.

204
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:26,990
Grab a T-shirt and cassette on
your way out. Thanks for coming.

205
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,681
Cut it.

206
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,937
- What's up?
- What's he doing here?

207
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,608
- What are you doing here?
- Bradley's our new front man.

208
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,656
You made your point.
Get him out now.

209
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,202
- Only one leaving is you.
- Chris, see these?

210
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,081
It's the new P.A. He brought with him.
And that's the new mixing board.

211
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,584
Have you heard his voice?

212
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,213
- Sit and spin.
- Dude, just relax.

213
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:09,259
I don't care if Bradley can hit
the notes Bobby Beers can hit.

214
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,428
Bobby's leaving the band anyway.

215
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:15,057
- You don't know.
- Nina and Samantha say he's leaving.

216
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,060
- Bullshit.
- It doesn't matter.

217
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:22,940
We want people to hear our originals.
We're tired of being a cover band.

218
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:27,528
- We're a tribute band.
- No, dude. We are a cover band.

219
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,989
The problem is, you think
you're in Steel Dragon.

220
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,659
I love you, man, but you're mental.

221
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:38,789
Get a grip on reality. You don't know
where Bobby Beers ends and you begin.

222
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:44,336
I'm mental, because I don't want
to be in a cheesy bar band...

223
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:49,216
that butchers music and makes them
listen to your crappy originals!

224
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:54,638
Crappy? "Whole and a Half" kicks ass.
I'm proud to have written it.

225
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,432
That's why we got
so many requests for it.

226
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:02,020
Don't shit on me because you're
scared to write your own songs.

227
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,692
Yeah, that's it. I'm too scared.

228
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,778
If you wanna make it,
you write your own tunes.

229
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:13,740
Thanks for the tip, bro.
Look, come on, guys.

230
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:19,079
We loved playing Dragon tunes. We
couldn't imagine playing anything else.

231
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:22,040
- I thought it'd be a goof.
- A goof?

232
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,002
Wouldn't you rather fail
as yourself...

233
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,546
than succeed as
a Bobby Beers clone?

234
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,425
You can write a song about
why I would wanna do that!

235
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,553
All right, you're gone. Just go!

236
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,139
What's so fucking funny?

237
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,725
Babe, come on. Let's go.

238
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:44,730
Fine. This is my mike stand!
I'm taking it! These are my cables.

239
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,232
I'll get new cables.

240
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,736
- Don't think I'm coming back.
- I don't.

241
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,239
- Well, that's because I'm not.
- Good.

242
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,744
I'm serious. If I leave,
I'm not coming back!

243
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,288
- You said that!
- Shut up, Bradley.

244
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,707
Last time.

245
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:12,090
Emily.

246
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:23,769
If you still want to manage us,
then it's okay with us.

247
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,606
Rob, I'm a businesswoman.

248
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:31,443
Rule one in this business is
you go where the talent is...

249
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:36,073
and all the fucking talent
that was in this band just left.

250
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,235
You know, those guys are
so replaceable.

251
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:18,740
It'll take me five minutes to put
together a band and blow them away.

252
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,330
Maybe this is just a sign.

253
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:29,418
You know, just time to move on.

254
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,506
I'm not in the mood to look
on the bright side now.

255
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:38,510
No, this is an opportunity for you...

256
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,637
to write your own songs.

257
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:41,889
Why?

258
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:46,852
Be another clown with a guitar,
trying to get attention? No way.

259
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,480
Remember what you wrote
for me on my birthday?

260
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,358
- No.
- Yes, you do.

261
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,117
Come on, please.
It's embarrassing.

262
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,208
Are you done making fun of me yet?

263
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,671
I love that song.

264
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,511
You're not getting it.
You're not hearing me.

265
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,097
I'm telling you,
first time I ever saw you...

266
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,059
first time I laid eyes on you...

267
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,563
sophomore year, Bill Starbuck
in <i>The Rainmaker.</i>

268
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:36,568
I said to myself,
"Oh, my God, that guy's got it."

269
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,403
I mean, my heart stopped.

270
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:46,411
And I said,
"That guy is going all the way."

271
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,171
I was just singing
someone else's lines.

272
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,550
I did not write them.

273
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:18,694
- My favorite color is rainbow.
<i>- Mine's mauve.</i>

274
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:23,031
I said no. Haley, did you answer
the telephone? Thank you.

275
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,325
Sunshine Daycare.

276
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,662
Chris! Telephone!

277
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,209
Telephone!
You want to help me crack eggs?

278
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:36,378
- I want five.
- Five eggs.

279
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,142
<i>Chris? Is that Chris Cole?</i>

280
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,312
- Who is this?
<i>- This is Kirk Cuddy.</i>

281
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,996
Ricki, your accent is
as lame as your playing.

282
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,917
What do you suggest
I do about my playing?

283
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,126
Who is this?

284
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:20,422
I told you, it's Kirk Cuddy.
I play in a band called Steel Dragon.

285
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,592
<i>- Maybe you've heard of us.</i>
- I don't have time.

286
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,346
Hang on, hang on.
Listen to this, all right?

287
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,606
Are you lip-synching?

288
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,527
If this is Kirk,
what did you call your third wife?

289
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:46,114
Do we have to talk about that old slag?
I called her Sugar Bum.

290
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:49,868
<i>The second wife, too.</i>
<i>It's why the third left.</i>

291
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:53,497
<i>Now I affectionately refer</i>
<i>to all ladies as Tottie.</i>

292
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,958
<i>Is that enough for you?</i>

293
00:31:56,166 --> 00:32:00,462
My God, this is unbelievable.
I was sorry to hear about your dog.

294
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:01,672
<i>Pookie?</i>

295
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,259
Yeah. I sent flowers
but I didn't get a response.

296
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,511
But I figured you're so busy.

297
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,681
Can we get past
the <i>This Is Your Life</i> crap?

298
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:15,185
There's a ticket waiting for you
for a flight to L.A. Tomorrow.

299
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,564
- Are you serious?
<i>- Of course I'm serious.</i>

300
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,108
<i>- Tell no one about this.</i>
- Yes, sir.

301
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,902
<i>Good man. I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

302
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,237
Bye.

303
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,393
Right there.

304
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,979
I'm Chris Cole.

305
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,565
I'm Tania. I work with the band.

306
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:04,943
- You went out with Bobby.
- You look like Bobby.

307
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:08,113
- Is that all you brought?
- My manager.

308
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:12,034
We traded the first-class ticket
for two coach.

309
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,619
How resourceful.

310
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,913
Yeah, well, I thought so.

311
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,707
What was that? Did you see that?

312
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,798
Why are we here?

313
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,969
I should let Kirk explain
everything to you.

314
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,973
Are those your breasts?

315
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,768
I'm sorry. What?

316
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,897
Your breasts. Are they yours?

317
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:48,278
Well, you know, I don't remember.

318
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:51,949
They're quite sensational.

319
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:55,536
Well, thanks.
That's just what I was going for.

320
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:58,205
So you're in a Steel Dragon cover band.

321
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,123
- Tribute band.
- Right.

322
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:04,253
I'm kind of sort of
in between bands right now.

323
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:09,967
- Your pants.
- Emily had them made for me.

324
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,678
I bet they're easy
to get in and out of.

325
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:19,685
So, when do we get there?
Tania, is it?

326
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:20,853
Tania.

327
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:44,334
- Are you famous?
- No, we're nobody. Sorry.

328
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:48,130
- Well, you should be!
- Oh, thank you. Bye.

329
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:53,051
- Can you get us in?
- I'm just trying to get in myself.

330
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,746
Follow me, darlings.

331
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:40,349
This is Bobby's <i>Twisted</i> tour in '77.

332
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,143
- Look at that.
- See the dragon?

333
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,612
That's Sammy!

334
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,469
Look!

335
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:26,103
It's a '58 Flying V
in fire-mist gold.

336
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:30,858
And it's the real one. Look.
The fingerboards are rosewood.

337
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,527
That's from the
<i>Delirious</i> tour, right?

338
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:37,114
- Are you two coming or what?
- Yeah. Sorry.

339
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:00,512
Wait right here, all right?

340
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:06,268
Thanks a lot, Ralph. That's great.

341
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,479
- That's it?
- Yeah. Very nice. Thanks.

342
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:11,148
Lovely.

343
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,239
They're ready for you now.

344
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,418
What's up?

345
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,671
Thanks for coming.
Not too fagged out?

346
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,841
- I don't think so.
- Mats, the road manager.

347
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,179
I saw you in Pittsburgh.
You gave everybody a pass but me.

348
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:45,349
From the looks of you,
I had good reason.

349
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:50,896
We saw a tape of you singing
provided by Nina and Samantha.

350
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:54,733
Is the incredible voice really yours?

351
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:57,736
- Cocksuckers!
- That would be you, Bobby.

352
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,864
You think some child
can replace me?

353
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,741
You want to do your thing.

354
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,660
- You're firing me?
- Calm down.

355
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,204
You calm down, you wanker!

356
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,707
- It's because I'm gay, isn't it?
- You're gay?

357
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:17,297
No, I have pierced nipples and a house
in Morocco because I'm John Wayne.

358
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:22,094
Have you listened
to the lyrics of "Stand Up"?

359
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,389
Did you really think
that Kim was a girl?

360
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:28,141
- Kim was a guy?
- Yeah, Kim was a guy.

361
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,770
He's my lover, to the horror
of these sausage-jockeys.

362
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:36,775
- As if we give a toss.
- Just keep your dick away from me.

363
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,235
Stop it, man.

364
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,697
You don't turn up
for recording sessions.

365
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,075
You missed half the gigs,
and when you did show...

366
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:49,079
I am Steel Dragon!
Without me, you're nothing!

367
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,247
Give us a break.

368
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,667
You'll be playing for coppers
in the tube without me!

369
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,252
We'll see.

370
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,213
Yeah. We'll see.

371
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,180
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

372
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:21,612
My scarf.

373
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,324
- Take it.
- Yeah, I will.

374
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:26,950
Good.

375
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,955
If I leave now, I'm never coming back.
Never.

376
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,249
Heard you the first time.

377
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,085
What you looking at?

378
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,756
You think you can dress like me
and be a star?

379
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:45,093
- No, sir.
- You have no idea what it takes.

380
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:48,514
You think it's all sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll?

381
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,015
You got the sex wrong.

382
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:54,311
I never touch drugs.
No one does a gig like I do half-cut.

383
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,979
Not even at your age.

384
00:39:56,188 --> 00:40:00,776
And it's bed, 11:30 every night
before a gig. That's what it takes.

385
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,945
Just do your own thing.

386
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:07,366
Get your own life.
It's like being bloody Elvis.

387
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,618
Except Elvis was the king.

388
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,002
And I'm just the queen.

389
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,882
Very funny.

390
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,510
Ha-bloody-ha.

391
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,806
Bastards. You bastards.

392
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,547
Sorry about that.

393
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,219
- Missed your cue.
- Yeah, sorry, IK...

394
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,930
- You do know this song?
- Yes, sir.

395
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,726
We'll pick it up just
coming out of the intro.

396
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:31,783
I'm sorry.

397
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,120
We wasting our time here?

398
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,415
Sorry. Could I start it one more time?

399
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,459
All right, go again.

400
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,628
Sorry about that.

401
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,300
<i>I love you.</i>

402
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:50,761
<i>I love you.</i>

403
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:36,575
Well, mate, do you want the gig, then?

404
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:42,915
Look in the lens, guys.
Go. Get in there more.

405
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,043
Give me attitude.
Two double-platinum records.

406
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:50,339
You're playing the Forum. You got
20 girls who want to be with you.

407
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:54,259
Give me rock star attitude.
Hold that. Here we go.

408
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,846
Hey, Izzy, let's try one
with attitude. No smile.

409
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,056
Sorry.

410
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,475
Better. Now you're looking cool.

411
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,978
Come on, right in my lens.
Nice shot. Attitude.

412
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:09,191
We combed this entire planet
looking for someone...

413
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:13,278
heavy enough to pull this off
and we found a star.

414
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:18,617
When this guy sings, you'll forget
about Bobby Beers. I promise you.

415
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,411
Izzy! Is that your name? Izzy?

416
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,540
Yeah, the name's Izzy,
like Izzy's Revenge.

417
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,625
Holy shit.

418
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,962
Izzy? I'm not calling him Izzy.

419
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,256
Can you hit all the notes
Bobby can?

420
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,758
That's why I'm in the band.

421
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,885
<i>Stand up and shout</i>

422
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:59,157
How do you keep your voice
in such great shape?

423
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,578
My choir teacher gives me
really cool exercises...

424
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:05,289
He eats a lot of pussy, that's how.

425
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,083
<i>Yeah, I eat a lot of pussy.</i>

426
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,128
- Classy.
- Like father, like son.

427
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,672
- That's my boy.
- Come on, you guys.

428
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,467
- How was I?
- So good. So comfortable.

429
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,803
- I messed up my accent.
- It was great.

430
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:24,558
- Nice way to handle that "pussy" line.
- I can't argue with him.

431
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:28,353
Izzy, don't worry.
I'll make an honest man out of you.

432
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,484
I eat a lot of pussy.

433
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,570
Loads of it.

434
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,200
I eat a lot of pussy.

435
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,785
Tons.

436
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:49,208
I got my voice eating pussy, man.
It's a vocal technique exercise.

437
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:54,505
I got it eating pussy.
Loads of it. All the time.

438
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:59,051
It's all I do. Breakfast, morning,
noon, night. I've got to have it.

439
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:03,055
It's all I do, is eat pussy.
I love it.

440
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,016
Either get in here and do it
or shut up.

441
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:09,895
Hold on. Oh, shit! I eat pussy!

442
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,076
Hi. I'm Izzy's mother.

443
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,797
- Have a good one.
- I'll see you up there.

444
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:24,469
- Did you see all the people?
- I know. Just breathe.

445
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:27,681
You'll be great.
Nobody knows these songs better.

446
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,850
- True.
- Be yourself, Chris.

447
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:31,310
- Don't get...
- Izzy.

448
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,815
You'll be great, babe.
I love you so much.

449
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,692
I love you too.

450
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:41,445
All right, matey.
Time to go to work.

451
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:44,239
Sorry, darling, back to the henhouse.

452
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,493
I'm gonna sit with his parents.

453
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,789
Whatever twirls your beanie.
Come on, mate.

454
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,501
- I gotta piss.
- What? You gotta piss?

455
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,002
- Go now.
- I can't.

456
00:47:57,211 --> 00:48:01,590
Or you gotta use it. Use it.
You're awesome. Bye, babe.

457
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:06,637
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

458
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:11,850
Well, you're in my house now, mate.
And I ain't lost a man yet.

459
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,727
- Let's do it.
- Here we go.

460
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:15,938
Let's do it, Mats.

461
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:20,817
This is your coronation, my dear.

462
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:25,280
There you go.

463
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:27,199
All right, boy.

464
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,409
You're okay.

465
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:33,789
You won't need it, but there's
a bucket in each wing, all right?

466
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,459
- Up you go.
- All right, Mats.

467
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,302
Break a leg!

468
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,623
Are you all right, Izzy?

469
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:13,824
END OF CD 1
