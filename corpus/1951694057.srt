1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,033
I'd like to say that in the beginning I was easier,

2
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:51,498
but must be told I was as bigger pain
then as I turn out to be later.

3
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,434
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

4
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:58,621
Right now the unbreakable bond between a mother
and daughter was about to be born

5
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:00,792
So just listen and watch

6
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:02,511
and pay attention.

7
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:07,492


8
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,111
Look, look...

9
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:37,443
Hey baby…

10
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,438
Gosh, she is beautiful!

10
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:44,438
She's changed our lives forever.

11
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:46,426
...If you only know…

12
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,646
Mom and dad had waited a long time for a kid.

13
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:56,748
They tried everything so you can only imagine

13
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:58,159
how many hopes and dreams fully pinned on me, 

14
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,503
their first born.
Even though I was a part of the plant.

14
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,503
- Honey!
- What?

15
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:05,312
Our kid, Jane, she's not make any noises.

16
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,617
She's fairly asleep.

17
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:09,171
Just let her was…

18
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:13,302
Robert, you gotta calm down

19
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,082
No no no...
I'm gonna check on her.

20
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:18,966
It turns out long to have a baby.

20
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,966
I'm not gonna let her suffocated.

21
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:23,766
You are insane!

22
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:26,800
Ok fine... I'm coming.

23
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:37,116
-What are you doing?
-I don't want to her turning red.

24
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,114
That was some of old moment for me.

25
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:41,193
Yes, I do too, remember it.

26
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:44,440
Baby is no way more stuff they goes on
than you think.

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,440
And from that moment on I feel like the spot light was on me,

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
which I've never get used to it.

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,875
Turn that light off!

28
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,802
Sorry, sorry…

29
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,798
To make it through year one is quite an accomplishment

30
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,488
although no one ever gives you a boy for it,

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,838
they really should.

32
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,936
And another thing I learned that year is 
that if parents could crazy glues to them, 

33
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:04,829
they would.

34
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:10,859
Sweetheart

35
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:14,033
My mother was pregnant and ready to pop again.

36
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,833
Then I stupidly thought that when Brad was born 

36
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,833
he'd take some of the pressure off me

37
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:19,570
Boy, was I wrong.

38
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,748
This was also the goo-goo ga-ga period.

38
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,748
It's a little doll.
So let's jump a head, shall we?

39
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:47,536
I wish our parents were here to see this.

40
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:50,647
Both mom and dad's parents were dead.

41
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,867
I missed not having great parents.

42
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,306
They missed not having parents more.

43
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:58,576
How long are we gonna sit here?

44
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:00,627
A long time.

45
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:03,822
My mother knew that some day she was going after to let me go

46
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:05,907
round free little one

47
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:08,522
But she didn't want to be on this day or another day soon.

48
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,921
So began the parents witness protection programme.

49
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,950
Honey, she's got to go to school

50
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,810
and I got to go to work

51
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,956
So either we do it as a family 
or I take it myself.

52
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,945
How important is kindergarten anyway…

38
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:24,748
I can't remember it. And you?

38
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,748
It's not the point.

38
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,748
What is the point?

54
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:29,159
The point is...we can't protect her forever.

55
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,118
Why not?

56
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:33,345
It's not healthy

57
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:36,272
It's healthy that you are not protecting.

58
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,839
Honey, she's...gotta be around kids.

58
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,839
She has to start developing social skills.

59
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:43,664
- Why?
- Oh...this is nuts. I'm taking her in.

60
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,281
Come on! Let's go.

61
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,361
Are you coming?

62
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,970
No...I want her to have the memory of you leaving.

63
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,949
Blackmail is an interesting thing if you use it properly.

64
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,416
My mother had a black belt in it.

65
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,848
My mother wanted to be a dancer.

66
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:36,228
But she will tell you about that later.

67
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,651
Let's just say her expectations were way too high.

68
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:02,692
They hide it so tightly that you could almost hear
the escape from my tiny little bodies.

69
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:05,818
You are wonderful.
Brilliant.

70
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,232
Is she brilliant?

71
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:08,538
Moving on.

72
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,059
Hey, baby...how you feeling?

73
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,568
Come on, sweetie.
Here, drink this.

74
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,312
Come on, make you feel better.
Promise.

75
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,516
My parents love me more than life itself.

76
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,994
But it was my mother who truly would've 
cut off her right arm had I asked her to.

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,697
Not quite sure why

77
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:33,697
But you get the picture.

77
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:37,697
Let's get to the good stuff.
Let's get to where my life really started, ok?

78
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,550
It's a very important day.

79
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,600
This is one thing suddenly begin to fall into place.

80
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:49,648
Our little girl...all grown up.

81
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:50,899
First day of high school.

82
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,238
Jenny, all the world is at your feet.

83
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,338
Dad…	

84
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:57,844
Mom…

85
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,444
I gotta go.

86
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:01,770
Just thought your father and me share this moment with you.

86
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,770
All right. But any more moments in, your little
girl's gonna be late for her first day to school.

86
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,770
It's not a good way for me to start my wonder years, is it?

87
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:11,610
- Get out the car.
- Hold it. Hold it.

88
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,874
- You forget it…
- Come on... come on…

89
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:26,061
From now on, I'm walking to school

90
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,277
by myself.

91
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,046
- Got it?
- Yeah we got it.

91
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:33,046
I don't think so.

92
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:59,578
I'm Ms. Walcott and I will be your English teacher

92
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:00,578
through your tortured first year of high school

93
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:02,946
and I guarantee that you'll make it
through the experience alive

94
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:08,073
Now, I'm pretty easy to get along with
as long as you follow a few of my simple rules

95
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,767
One, if you show me respect, I will show it to you

96
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,458
and two, if you have any questions, ask me

97
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:20,802
and three, if you're feeling overwhelmed
and need somebody to talk to, you can talk to me.

98
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:23,099
I know it's hard to believe

99
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,716
but I'm not so old that I can relate 
to what you might be going through.

100
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:32,433
So, let's hit the book, shall we?
I want you to turn to page 424 

101
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,523
in Latin language…

102
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,273
The beauty of reading is that it's personal,

103
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,102
it's your interpretation.

104
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,143
It's what you think, it's what you feel,

105
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:45,357
it's what you see

105
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,030
and that's what makes it so magical.

106
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,554
And I hope that if you learn nothing else from me

107
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:52,281
I set you learn to love words.

108
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,647
They will save you someday…
Trust me on that.

109
00:08:58,861 --> 00:08:59,978
Have a great lunch!

110
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,839
Jane, over here!

111
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:14,743
I can't believe you are not in our class.

112
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:15,109
Who do you get?

112
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:18,109
Ms. Walcott. She's cool, though.

112
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,109
She is my guidance counsellor too.

113
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,062
You luck just never ends.

114
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,440
We gotta bone head Mr. Speavek

115
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,623
That's the new boy.

116
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,712
Oh, is he a hottie or what?

117
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,859
Oh my god! Jane, he smiled at you!

118
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,946
Why did he smile at you, why not at me?

119
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,749
Competition is an ugly quality. 

119
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,749
When I can honestly say 
it was not a problem for me.

120
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,811
Although I have many other problems,
that was not one of them.

121
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,746
Hi, I'm Ned.

122
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:57,809
Elizabeth, Betsy, Claire and Jane.

123
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,260
Nice meeting you.

124
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,875
Jane's got a boyfriend, 
Jane's got a boyfriend!

125
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:11,677
Leave me alone,
I'm not interested.

126
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:15,396
You are idiot then.
He was positively dreary.

127
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,535
- So?
- So don't be retarded.

127
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,093
He is like the cutest guy I've ever seen here 

128
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:24,296
except for Todd Burkin, captain all the football team

129
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,832
who I'm going after studying today.

130
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:33,001
But back to you, we need to jump start your hormones.
You’re a way of high.

131
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,502
And that's where the fingerpointing begin.

132
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:43,331
-Brad, stop it. I'm doing homework.
-So?

133
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,632
-Mom!
-What is it honey?

134
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,109
I was in here first and I need to do my homework.

135
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,730
- Brad, turn the Nintendo off.
- Why?

136
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,792
- Your sister's studying.
- She always gets her way.

137
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,850
You go wash and up for dinner.

138
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,020
Should I been a girl, then you'll be nicer to me.

139
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,889
-Goodness...
-You'd been a lovely girl.

140
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:03,912
Jane!

141
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,588
As you can tell, I didn't much care for my brother

142
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,079
I don't even know why, but I think it's mandatory.

143
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,012
Jenny, be nice to your brother!

143
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,012
Why?

144
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:21,435
Lost about your homework?

145
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,366
Yeah, it's Maths.

146
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,463
Sorry, can't help you there.

147
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,304
Well, how do you get through in school?

148
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,667
I didn't.

149
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,328
What were you good at?

150
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,086
Mmmm... English... Recess...

151
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,823
You are smarter than I was in your age…

152
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:42,054
You do fine.

152
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:44,054
I think not.

153
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,274
What do you say Saturday...the two of us

154
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:53,346
just the girls, do little shopping, go to movies

155
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,426
Just ciao…

156
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:56,751
Is not the phrase, just ciao?

157
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:59,891
No...It’s hang...

157
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,891
oh, hang…
 
158
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:01,868
What do you say?

159
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,406
I will say you are the bomb.

159
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:09,406
Oh, I'm the bomb. Oh, I am the bomb. Great!

160
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:13,909
And at that time, I meant it with all of my little heart.

161
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:17,883
So, how do you like high school?

162
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:19,902
It's ok.

163
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:21,897
Compare to what? Surgery?

164
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:24,022
Bob, you just find it thrilling

164
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,447 
because you don't have to go through it again.

165
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,946
If you back to go back that far,
if you could really remember.

166
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,464
It was pretty rough, you know,
new kids, new teachers.

167
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,686
Don’t know where to go, do questions.

168
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:34,944
Brad, dinner!

169
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,869
Sweetheart, we have to start planning 
your sweet sixteen party

170
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:40,760
Why? It's months away!

171
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,049
You never start too early planning really important events.

172
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,215
I really don't wanna a party.

173
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,467
What? Everybody wants a sweet sixteen party!

174
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:50,801
Everyone but me.

175
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:05,327
I don't know  
what teenage girl especially

176
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,911
doesn't wanna have a sweet sixteen party.

177
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,584
You know, it's what every kids should have.

178
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:11,102
Wait a second, who are you?

178
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:14,102
That Janice I know all these years never did anything 
that was expected ever?

179
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:17,977
Yeah, what happen to the hell was society girl.

180
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,441
We all used to know in love.

181
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:20,688
She became my mother

181
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,688
A mother?

181
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:24,688
Jane found out?

182
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,012
Woo..Ouch! That is cold

182
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,012
But accurate…

183
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,675
How do you do in that Maths test?

184
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,857
Hum...I think I will pick out a C.

185
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,374
I'm so proud of you 
!
185
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:45,374
You're the only member of this family hasn't flunk maths.

186
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:47,038
Thanks.

187
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:50,335
So any cute boys in this school?

188
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,497
No, I just started going there.

189
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:53,971
It's alright.

190
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,558
Do you have a boyfriend right away in high school?

191
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,074
Yeah.	

192
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,890
When did you first have sex?

193
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,965
Excuse me?

193
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:06,398
I know you know the answer.

194
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:09,029
Yes, I do. I'm just trying to remember it. I was 21

195
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:11,509
Such a liar.

195
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:12,591
Yes, I am.

196
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,853
Did you always wanna kids?

197
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,618
Far back? I can't remember

198
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:18,951
Why you stick with dancing?

199
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,162
I wasn't really good at it…

199
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:24,162
Then I tried to be a writer,
I really had passion for it.

200
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,160
But I really had passion for is being a mother. 

201
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,938
That's job in the world.

202
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,929
I'm kinda glad you are good at anything

203
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:36,126
Do me a favour, next Maths test, just pick out a B.

204
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:38,906
I'll try…

204
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:39,906
Thank you very much!	

205
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,816
Your reading assignment is going to be crime and punishment.

206
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,862
I'm kidding!

207
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:49,846
Ok

207
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:53,746
Sorry, I'm late.

207
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,746
Paper work took longer than I planned for.

208
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:58,025
That's ok. Just take a seat in the back.

209
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,512
So as we are saying,

209
00:15:02,513 --> 00:15:04,512
we are gonna find something exciting for you to read.

210
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:09,771
Hi, I'm Taylor

210
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:10,771
Hi, I'm Jane

211
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:11,742
Hi Jane!

212
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,280
She was different, smarter, wiser…

213
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,365
Maybe it was just because 

214
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,675
she wasn't from here.

215
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,461
But maybe it was just her…

216
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:25,544
I don't know but I'm gonna go with the last one

216
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,544
and I should know

216
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:28,544
because Taylor would end up changing my life.

217
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:37,798
Hi!

218
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:40,000
I didn't mean to scare you.

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You didn't.

219
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:45,715
I'm a little behind on what book,
we need on some of the assignments.

219
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,715
Do you think you could fill me in?

220
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,848
Sure

220
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,848
Ok

221
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,307
You're my saviour.

221
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,307
No, you wouldn't go that far.

222
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,696
Hi, what are you doing?

223
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,022
Oh, this is Taylor,

223
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,022

223
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,022
So I just help her catch up on her assignments.

224
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:14,691
This is Elizabeth, Bessy and Claire.

225
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:16,845
Hi

225
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,531
Going to a movie tonight, wanna come?

226
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,145
Oh I can't. I have to baby-sit my brother

227
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:23,833
See you tomorrow then.

228
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,547
Hey, what it be ok if I came over tonight?

229
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,409
We can go over this stuff.

230
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,477
Yeah, around 8 o'clock?

230
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:36,477
Sure

231
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,480
Excuse me, is the bulter night off?

231
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Answer the door.

232
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,827
- Hey.
- Hi, you two look nice.

232
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,827
Thank you

232
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,827
You guys double-dating?

233
00:16:57,827 --> 00:16:58,360
I am not his type, wrong hype

233
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Hahaha, funny.

234
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,942
Hi, Brad.

234
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:03,942
What is this, Halloween?

235
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,380
Oh, I haven't tell you mom there is a new girl
at school coming over


235
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
so that I can help her
catch up on class.

236
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,253
-Hello.
-Hi, I'm Taylor.

237
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,394
Hi, Taylor, I'm Janice, Jane's mother.

238
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,617
This is Jimmy and Beth. This is Taylor.

239
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:20,545
- Hi.
- Hi, Taylor.

240
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:23,875
And the one on the couch in a coma...

240
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,875
staring at the screen is Brad.

241
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,475
Brad!

242
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,461
Roberts, this is Taylor.

243
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,670
This is Jane's friend and gonna do dome homework together.

244
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:30,981
Great. Hi, Taylor.

245
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:33,012
So Taylor you from around out here.

246
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,513
Janice, we do not have time.

247
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:35,756
Yeah, right, we have a minute.

248
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,280
What do your parents do?

249
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,450
My parents were divorced when I was 6

250
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:42,648
and I live with my mom, 
she works full time for the phone company.

251
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,372
Do you have brothers?

252
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,833
-Mom...
-Jane, it's ok. I can take it.

253
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:49,220
So anybody else have any questions?

254
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,351
Yeah, how many pets?

254
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,351
Funny, really funny...

254
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:54,351
Our number will be on the edge of refrige 
if you need us. Just in case.

255
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,577
Bye sweetie.

256
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,828
Bye Brad, not too late.

257
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,449
Brad, turn it off. I have company.

257
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:05,449
Who cares?

258
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,013
Go play your computer 'coz next time I won't aim so high.

259
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:11,695
Sorry, I think he is adopted.

260
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:13,844
Yeah, must be rough...

261
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,412
But even have a jerk as a younger brother is
better than I don't have one at all.

262
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:25,736
You go to high school full of fear and excitement

262
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,736
so many emotions that your body can barely handle
all the things rising through it 

263
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:32,753
Then it gets worse just when you thought 
it couldn't get any more complicated

264
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,486
Why wasn't I like my friends?

265
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:36,764
Why wasn't I like everyone else?

265
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:39,016
Why couldn't I just like a boy named Ned?

266
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,560
I was in trouble.

267
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,613
Big, big trouble.

268
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,379
I had a crush on a girl.

269
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,573
Hey, Jane!

270
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,583
Oh hey, you know Taylor right?

271
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,095
Yeah.

271
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,095
Hi, how're things?

272
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,180
Good.

272
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
All right, see you later.

273
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,857
Boy, does he have a crush on you?

274
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,821
No, he doesn't.

274
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,821
Yes, he does.

275
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,579
I don't blame him.

276
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,447
Did anyone have trouble with "Wuthering heights"? 

276
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:27,609
Kate?

277
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,830
I thought it was hard to read 'coz it was so sad

278
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:31,778
Anyone else? Grant?

279
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,728
I thought it was too much about love and should have more story…

280
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:39,083
Jane?

281
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,064
I think all the greatest stories ever written are about love 

281
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,064
no matter what plot they are rapt in...

282
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:48,279
Jane's right,

283
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,311
love is complicated

284
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,178
and with that sadness

285
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:53,960
is great beauty.

286
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:56,045
But how about next time,

286
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,045
I'll give you something a little more fun to read

287
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,337
Jane, what are you doing here?

288
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,444
Well, you haven't been in school

289
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:20,943
and I called a couple of times...I was worried.

290
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,462
I want to come by to see if you are ok.

291
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:28,015
Are you ok?

292
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,222
Yeah, I'm fine.

292
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:32,222
I just can't come to school for a while

293
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,616
Taylor? Taylor, where are you?

294
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,885
You don't come in right now, you're going be so sorry.

295
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,230
You hear me? I'm your mother for god's sake...

296
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,693
Look, you shouldn't have called.
Ok, I'll call you when I can.

297
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,125
Taylor!

298
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,459
At that moment, I thank god for my mother.

299
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,566
Maybe the reason Taylor seems so much more grown-up 
than the rest of us 

300
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,948
was because she was forced to grow up faster 
than the rest of us.

301
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:21,801
Hey

301
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:22,801
Hey

302
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:27,385
Hummm, I was wonder if maybe
we can get together sometime,

303
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,446
movie or something.

304
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:31,901
Why couldn't I just say yes?

305
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:34,090
My life would've been so much easier.

306
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:36,621
I like you, Ned,

307
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,777
but...I don't really wanna a boyfriend right now.

308
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:42,472
That's ok. How about friend?

309
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:44,958
Ok

310
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,001
Hi, Jane.
Why aren't you talking?

311
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,742
What could I possibly have to say to you?

312
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,694
Jane, what's the matter with you?

312
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:56,694
Nothing

313
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:57,453
Mush pork.
Wanna pass the salt?

314
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,354
Something is matter with you

314
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:00,354
'coz you've been snapping everybody lately.

315
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:02,181
I told you nothing is wrong.

316
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,170
I wish I could've told her

316
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,170 
that I had so many feelings running through me,

317
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:10,288
things I didn't even understand.

318
00:22:11,052 --> 00:22:12,666
But I couldn't tell her.

318
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,666
I didn't even know how to put it into words.

319
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,354
- Can I be excused?
- No, stay and finish your dinner.

320
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:19,016
I'm not hungry.

321
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:21,698
You can go Jane. You're excused.

322
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,441
If I say one thing

322
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,441
don't undercut me and say another.

323
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,221
Why do you always have to have the last word?

324
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:34,500
I told.

325
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,424
Come in.

326
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:46,374
I probably should've let you just go to your room.

327
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:49,058
But I got upset. 

328
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:52,686
You haven't been yourself lately...
I worry about you.

329
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:57,514
I know you do.
It's just growing pains.

330
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,392
You know you can tell me anything.

331
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,132
You may find it's difficult to believe

331
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,132
but I actually went through this myself once.

332
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,643
I'm your mother, I'm your friend,
I just wanna help you.

333
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:09,923
It's ok.

334
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:11,729
Don't worry.

335
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:17,135
Your friend Taylor's here.
You want for company?

336
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:18,043
Yeah

336
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:22,043
You would've been blind 
not to see me light up at Taylor's name.

336
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:24,043
Thank god parents don't have a clue sometimes.

337
00:23:24,043 --> 00:23:27,201
If kids were drunk or stoned
and fell over in front of them

337
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:30,201
they'd convince themselves
that was an inner-ear problem.

338
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,408
Hey

338
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,408
Hey

339
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,182
Are you ok?

340
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:49,588
No

341
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:09,766
I know my mom's having a rough time 

342
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:11,500
taking care of me

343
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:15,516
and making ends meet

344
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:17,035
but

345
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,314
it never gets any better.

346
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:22,799
She blames me for the divorce.

347
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,881
When she looks at me

348
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,653
she sees him

349
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,715
and she goes crazy…

350
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:38,482
I...

351
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,185
I could take the hitting

351
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:43,185
if I just knew that someday it might stop.

352
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:56,908
You'll be ok.

353
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,916
Did this make me gay?

354
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,308
No

355
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,357
It's just an innocent crush phase.

355
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,979
At least that's what I kept telling myself.

356
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:03,151
But I also know that it
was the first moment in my life

356
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:05,151
that I ever felt connected to someone.

357
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,895
What do you say pick you up after school?
we go somewhere...

358
00:26:11,713 --> 00:26:13,750
Like where?

358
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,750
I don't know. Anywhere you want.

359
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,948
I can't.
I have plans with Taylor.

360
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:20,731
Don't get me wrong, I really like Taylor...

361
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:22,041
But what happen to Elizabeth, Besty and Claire. 

362
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,787
You haven't even seen them anymore.

363
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,113
They are still my friends.
I just...

363
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:27,113
have a new one.

364
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:58,310
I knew I was hurting my old friends

364
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,310
but they will never gonna get along with Taylor.

365
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:02,104
I had to choose that with the feelings I had for her.

365
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:04,104
She is bond to win.

366
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,482
I'm really glad I moved here.

367
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,925
I'm too.

368
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:24,133
Do you think Taylor's far much mature for her age?

369
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:25,679
No, not really.

370
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,786
Mmmm, I think Jane's spending
too much time with her.

371
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,324
It's not healthy.

372
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:32,041
Why, they are friends.

372
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:36,041
She has no seeing her other friends...
dating, almost 16.

373
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:40,915
We talk about it some other time?

374
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:43,449
She should be going out with boys. 
She should be giving us heart attack right now.

375
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:44,677
Yeah, well. You are not
gonna win me over your side.

375
00:27:44,677 --> 00:27:45,677
I'm not. What?

375
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:49,677
'coz I preferred Jane never date a boy as long as she lived.

376
00:27:49,677 --> 00:27:50,672
You just...

377
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,405
You know what a boy want.

377
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,405
Who was your name again?

378
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:57,131
Finals are just around the corner.

379
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:59,481
If you need help studying, just ask.

380
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,292
I'll stay late and help you.
So, just let me know ok?

381
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:06,150
I love you too.

382
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,746
It didn't matter how much they like Ms. Walcott

382
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:11,746
Kids are like pets and dogs.
When they hear the bell, they gotta go.

383
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,936
So my mom is out of town tonight, you wanna come over?

384
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:16,554
Sure.

385
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:23,305
It would be nice if you have told me 
before I made dinner

385
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:25,305
that you would be home for it.

386
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,042
What's the big deal?

387
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:28,727
What's the big deal?

387
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:30,727
The cook day for the family which you are a part of.

388
00:28:31,394 --> 00:28:32,369
You cook every night...
Like I said, what's the big whoop?

389
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:35,684
Excuse me, what's the big whoop?

390
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,435
You just watch your tone with me, young lady.

390
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:42,435
Boy, you are turning into such a smart ass.

390
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:43,435
You are never like this when you around your other friends.

391
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,570
What? You wanna blame this on Taylor?

392
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:47,989
You know you can stand is that 
I'd rather be with her...

392
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:48,989
than with you.

393
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,227
What was I doing there?

394
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:05,526
I still have time to leave. She will never know.

395
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,323
I could have said food poisoning

396
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:11,016
or cramps
That's a good one...cramps.

397
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,828
Who was I kidding?

397
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:14,828
I wanna to be there, ready or not.

398
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:43,928
Are you sure you wanna do this?

399
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:46,721
No

400
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,900
Do you want me to stop?

400
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,900
Tell me to stop...

401
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,009
No

402
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,625
I was so terrified that I thought 
I have a heart attack...

403
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,426
I wanted her to stop...

404
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:13,922
No I didn't...
Yes I did...

405
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,209
No I didn't...

406
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:41,999
It’s hard enough having sex
for the first time with anyone

407
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,999
but when you do with a girl...

408
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,083
you're just asking for it

409
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,281
Hey

410
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:53,557
Are you OK?

411
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,011
No

412
00:30:57,011 --> 00:31:01,011
I think what happened was a mistake
and that should not happen 

413
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:02,305
Why?

414
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,675
I don't know, because it isn't normal?

415
00:31:06,302 --> 00:31:07,398
So what's normal?

416
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,366
I guess...

417
00:31:10,774 --> 00:31:12,125
going out with boys?

418
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,825
And that if you go out with a girl
you might be gay, which I don't think I am...

419
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:17,504
OK. First of all it doesn't make you gay.

420
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,887
And if you were, what's the big deal?

421
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:23,452
Everything

422
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:25,334
Fine. 

423
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,418
Go back to your boring little friends then.

424
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,400
Are you ok?

425
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:12,054
No. Could you take me home?
I don't feel good.

426
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:13,229
Yeah. Sure.

427
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:19,581
Own life or her own friends just don't want
to be around her mother anymore.

428
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:22,197
Of course she doesn’t want to be around you

429
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,197


430
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:25,232
I mean, she's a teenager do u blame her?

431
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,896
Thank you for those kind words.

432
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:30,487
Jennis, none of us wanted to be around
our mother when we were teenager

433
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:31,486
This is different

434
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,061
- How?
- I don't know

435
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:34,853
I just wish I still have a baby

436
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,731
Why? 

437
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:38,731
You thought she needed you that is sick.

438
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:42,931
I mean you should be thrill, but she is
a person with her own ideas

439
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,369
and dreams and polls.

440
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:46,120
Oh I am not

441
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Oh look at the bright side, you still have brad to suffocate

442
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:49,147
He is a boy

443
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:52,057
He won't need his mother until
he gets his first apartment

444
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,057
and need someone to decorate it for him.

445
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:58,539
You can laugh all you want 
but she is hurting and I can't help her.

446
00:32:58,827 --> 00:32:59,839
She won't talk to me.

447
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,839
Maybe she needs to sort out things herself,
and then she'll talk to you.

448
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,564
Yeah just give her some time

449
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:07,564
I mean and take comfort in the fact 

450
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:10,564
that you are the millions of mothers to
go through the exact same thing this week

451
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,556
and thank God you two enjoy these lunches.

452
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,872
Check

453
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,676
Hi

454
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:28,112
Could we talk?

455
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:29,674
About what?

456
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:31,915
About us.

457
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:35,027
I got scared Taylor, I’m sorry.

458
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:38,493
- I’d like another chance.
- There are no us Jane.

459
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,177
I want to be with people who
are sure they want to be with me.

460
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,267
Come on Jane, come with me, ok?

461
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:10,047
- Whatever it is Jane, it will be ok.
- No it won't.

462
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,983
You just got to pull yourself together.

463
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:14,660
I can't.

464
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,968
In a little while, you'll feel
better with whatever it is upsetting you.

465
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:21,286
You’ll see, things will change.

466
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,648
I don't want to feel better.

467
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:27,064
And when something's happened
it doesn't change.
 

468
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,545
You wanna talk about it?

469
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:35,474
Fine, you wanna know what I am upset about?

470
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:38,880
I slept with someone for the first time.

471
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:42,405
That can be traumatic for everyone.

472
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,113
No I think it is more traumatic for me.

473
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,441
We broke up already.

474
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,266
It’s that what you wanted to do?

475
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:51,591
No

476
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,024
But that's what I did because I’m a coward.

477
00:34:55,523 --> 00:34:56,383
No you’re not.

478
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:01,751
In our first sexual experience

479
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:07,291
we sometimes invest ourselves
wisely and sometimes foolishly

480
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:08,291
and it doesn’t matter which

481
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,906
because in the end the investment is the same

482
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:14,982
but if you want to be with them

483
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,159
you gotta tell them that.

484
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:17,442
I did.

485
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:19,445
They’d moved on.

486
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:22,980
But if you don’t try again you will never forgive yourself.

487
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:27,438
My advice to you is...

488
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,705
write them a letter

489
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,705
and then tell them why you did what you did
and how you really feel.

490
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:50,495
Honey you have to eat.

491
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:52,407
I’m not hungry.

492
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,762
I know I know I know I sound like a broken record but...

493
00:35:56,774 --> 00:35:57,945
I’m just trying to help.

494
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,574
Can you tell me what's going on?

495
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:02,470
I just want to be alone.

496
00:36:03,348 --> 00:36:04,470
Please…

497
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,101
Okay

498
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:18,628
Taylor my life changed the moment I met you…

499
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:21,001
Only I was too stupid to see it.

500
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:24,039
Actually I was scared and I’m sorry for that.

501
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,918
You took my breath away and that frightened me.

502
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,307
I’m not frightened anymore
and I’d like another chance.

503
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,737
Hey Jane

504
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,962
Hey

505
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:39,962
What’s going on?

506
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:40,593
Nothing

507
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:43,077
What happened to your friend Taylor?

508
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:44,405
I haven't seen you with her lately.

509
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,502
She isn't around.

510
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,146
Does she have a new friend?

511
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:51,582
I gotta go.

512
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:54,729
I wanted to like them again
but boy, they made it hard.

513
00:36:58,504 --> 00:37:00,526
Well, is everyone gotta behave themselves?

514
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,789
I am not sure about her, though.

515
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,342
Don’t your lord Brad, it's really a bad idea.

516
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:08,341
You want to live for your fifteenth birthday,
don't you?

517
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:10,152
Bye though.

518
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:12,214
Bye kids.

519
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:20,376
What?

520
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:48,734
- Hi
- Hi

521
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:51,512
I’ve got your letter.

522
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:54,147
Can we talk privately?

523
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:55,853
Yeah

524
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,031
No I should have known this gotta be hard for you.

525
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:10,464
For anyone…

526
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:13,154
and I am sorry I took it so personally.

527
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:15,329
I was hurt.

528
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,845
but when I got you letter, it was just...beautiful.

529
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,331
I thought you were dating anyone else.

530
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,331
There is never anyone else.

531
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:41,115
Whose little brother who's in the same classes
our ex-friend Jane's little brother

532
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:44,700
knows the most disgusting thing ever about Jane.

533
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,402
Tell, tell!

534
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:50,368
Someone saw Jane and Taylor kissing.

535
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:52,358
Shut up!

536
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:53,785
I swear.

537
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:58,607
I’ll get it.

538
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:01,664
Hello

539
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,116
Yes this is she…

540
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:06,892
What?

541
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:08,489
Who is this?

542
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:14,373
Who is this?

543
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,737
But...this is some kind of sick joke…
Where did you...

544
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,749
Who is this? Where did you hear such a thing? Hello?

545
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,058
When I said it was a phase, 

546
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:30,103
it wasn't.
I was gay, with or without Taylor.

547
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,359
I knew it deep down for a long time.

548
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,793
But what my mother didn't know is that
I was exactly who I was meant to be.

549
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:38,602
Whether she liked it or not.

550
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:43,198
What kind of person would do such a thing?

551
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,743
It’s probably just a kid make a phone call.

552
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,977
No no no no no this is not what our kids slander as what it is.

553
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:50,977
Calm down, it just gossip.
There is nothing to it.

554
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:53,671
- Why would anyone say such a thing?
- I don't know

555
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:57,690
Why would everyone called but total stranger say 
“Oh your sixteen year old child is a lesbian”.

556
00:39:57,926 --> 00:39:59,206
Oh, people are so sick.

557
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:00,606
Maybe...hum...

558
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:05,604
Maybe...she was learning how to kiss.

559
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:07,191
What?

560
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:08,191
Girls do that, don't they?

561
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:10,191
They practise maybe is that she was doing. 

562
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:12,996
We should ask her.

563
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:13,996
Why should we obsess her with this advice?

564
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:15,566
We have to protect her.

565
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:17,137
Whoever called us...

566
00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:19,312
might start calling her friends.

567
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,446
Come in.

568
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,130
- Hi
- Hi

569
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,909
Honey, we need to talk.

570
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:36,702
Yes

571
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:38,300
We got a phone call…

572
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:40,192
A very disturbing phone call…

573
00:40:40,835 --> 00:40:42,035
And...

574
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:46,466
We know this isn't true, but...
we thought we should talk to you about it…

575
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:48,243
because...

576
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,243
We thought we should warn you

577
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:53,510
Warn me about what?

578
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:00,045
What?

579
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,897
We don't know who called, honey,
but...

580
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:07,867
They said that...the...

581
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:09,501
You were a lesbian.

582
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:14,933
They said someone had seen you

583
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,222
kissing Taylor...

584
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,739
We know if it is just a gossip.

585
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:29,091
you can tell from the way she said that
what she thought was out of the question

586
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:33,283
I was frozen with fear, I wanted
so badly to tell the truth

587
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,283
but I was so afraid of losing my parents.

588
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:37,243
I couldn't speak.

589
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:39,558
Is it possible...

590
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:41,459
that you kissed Taylor,

591
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,684
that...you were...

592
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:46,684
practising with her?

593
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:57,578
Yeah...that's what we were doing.

594
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,137
It won't happen again

595
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:06,501
Oh...well...

596
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,661
We didn't mean to upset you, honey,
but...

597
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:13,766
there are some nasty people in this world.

598
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:15,386
Don’t worry about it, baby.

599
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,406
We love you.
Good night, sweetie.

600
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:20,932
Good night.

601
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:29,746
I used the word "coward" before

602
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:33,365
but I never really understood 
what it was meant until that moment.

603
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,125
I was ashamed about my feelings
because it was someone else might think

604
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,632
I made myself sick

605
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:49,966
Come on in baby.

606
00:42:51,098 --> 00:42:52,490
You don't look so good.

607
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,919
Ok...tell me what's going on?

608
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:11,056
My mom got this anonymous phone call
saying he saw me kissing a girl

609
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,424
And I told her it wasn't true.

610
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:17,387
Okay, you lost me.

611
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:19,689
Sounds like you have no problem.

612
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,487
I lied to her.

613
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:25,483
I was kissing a girl,

614
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:27,197
and slept with a girl,

615
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:31,941
but the way...she was talking about...

616
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:33,941
I know if I told her the truth. She’d hate me.

617
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:39,753
I’ve gone gay Jimmy.

618
00:43:42,272 --> 00:43:43,376
It’s ok.

619
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,452
Sometimes it is easier not to tell the truth…

620
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:48,726
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

621
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,145
I don't know what to do.

622
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:53,586
You’re the only gay person I’ve ever known.

623
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:54,782
Don’t worry.

624
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,450
It happens to all of us.

625
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:00,460
First times someone despise or call us a name.

626
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:02,831
It’s just a "don't ask-don't tell" moment.

627
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,995
What if my parents find out?

628
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:08,625
If people find out? They are all gonna hate me.

629
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:10,795
Honey, I am black and I am a gay.

630
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,569
They hate me way more than they'll hate you.

631
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:19,703
What did you do?

632
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:21,878
You get to fix skin?

633
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:26,237
I have once since I was a baby.
Cause I had to have it.

634
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:28,828
I don't take personally anymore.

635
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:31,932
Because I know it is based
on ignorance and fear

636
00:44:32,442 --> 00:44:35,555
and it ain't about me, really,
it's about them.

637
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,896
I don't wanna hurt my mother.

638
00:44:42,787 --> 00:44:45,531
But I don't know how long
I can keep this as a secret.

639
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,819
You know when time is right.

640
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:53,755
Maybe we'll be ok.

641
00:44:54,964 --> 00:44:58,103
and you've been friends with mother
for a long time and she accepted you

642
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:00,485
but you're her baby.

643
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:04,235
Mother and daughter are about this complicated as it gets…

644
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,762
Jimmy please don't tell my mother anything I’ve told you!

645
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:15,448
Not a word.

646
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,448
I was so glad Jimmy was in the world.

647
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:34,206
Its ok Jane, keep walking.

648
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:37,335
- Hey lesbos!
- Punk!

649
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,693
We were about to run at children's hour?

650
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,783
Now stop all this nonsense all of you.

651
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:54,588
Open your books…

652
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:01,229
So what do you guys doing this weekend?

653
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,145
I am going Jeff's parents, play metrogolf.

654
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:06,992
Jane, what about you?

655
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,018
- I am seeing Taylor.
- I prefer you don't see that girl.

656
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,672
She is not a girl mom.

656
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:14,672
She is a dyke!

657
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,229
- Jane!
- Cut it off!

658
00:46:20,782 --> 00:46:22,508
Look at you are!

659
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,290
-Go to your own room!
-Why? He started it! 

659
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,290
Why isn't it going to his room?

660
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,549
Cause I am not a dyke!

661
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,286
- Go to your room!
- Go to your room, right now!

662
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:30,604
Come on! Come on!

663
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:33,701
You just can't attack your brother like that!

664
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:34,946
You can't just do that!

665
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:39,256
It was now and never, and I would prefer never…

666
00:46:39,405 --> 00:46:42,381
It was out of control and I have to something.
 
666
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:46,381
So I took the deepest breath
I’ve never taken in my entire life.

667
00:46:48,198 --> 00:46:49,187
You are younger than you are!

668
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:52,291
And next time you say something off
just let it roll off your back.

669
00:46:52,496 --> 00:46:55,306
-This was just gossip.
-It not just gossip!

670
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:01,497
I lied to the two of you

671
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,642
because I was afraid

672
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:09,107
afraid that you'll hate me,

672
00:47:09,107 --> 00:47:11,107
afraid that you'll throw me out.

673
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,325
I did kiss Taylor

674
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:19,863
and I think I am in love with her.

675
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:24,687
But... 

676
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:27,453
She is a girl.

677
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:29,826
- You don't know what're you saying.
- Yes, I do.

678
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,267
 But it's ok, because...

679
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:36,194
Taylor is a really good person.

680
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,475
That’s not the point.

681
00:47:39,258 --> 00:47:43,570
Why is it wrong for me to care about someone

681
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,570
and for someone to care about me?

682
00:47:44,932 --> 00:47:46,205
Because it's not right!  

683
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:48,295
You... you don't have a clue.

684
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:50,016
If you are saying you're a gay…

684
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:52,016
You have no comprehension of what that means!

685
00:47:52,393 --> 00:47:53,866
I don't care anymore!

686
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:55,606
It’s what I feel…

686
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,606
It’s what you feel?

687
00:47:57,606 --> 00:47:59,383
How do you know what you feel? 

687
00:47:59,383 --> 00:48:01,383
You’re 16-year-old kid.

688
00:48:01,608 --> 00:48:02,532
Look, it's just a phase,

688
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:03,532
it's gonna stop right here.

689
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:05,235
It’s not just phase!

690
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:11,223
I am gay!

691
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,488
You could see it through my eyes

692
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:22,816
to have someone you are care about,
care about you

693
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:28,092
and they make you feel
not so alone in this world

694
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,004
This really matter who the person is?

695
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:34,172
Of course it matters.

696
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:38,954
Why?

697
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:40,606
Why?

698
00:48:41,337 --> 00:48:43,513
It is since when you hate gay people.

698
00:48:43,513 --> 00:48:45,513
Jimmy has been your friend forever, he is a gay.

699
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:47,268
He is not my daughter!

700
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:14,997
I used to be at emergency rooms

701
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,513
skin needs, breathless, broken hearts, not this

701
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:19,513
this wasn't a part of my plan.

702
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:21,878
I know, it wasn't a part my plan neither.

703
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:24,710
What the horrible thing to do is I am her mother?

704
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,233
No you are a great mother.
It’s not about you.

704
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,233
We have to do something Bobbie?

705
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:30,562
The world is not tore that place.

706
00:49:31,408 --> 00:49:32,901
Her life can be reverted.

706
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:33,901
I know..

707
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:36,184
She is not a baby anymore.

707
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:38,184
But she is…

708
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,688
she is my baby…

709
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:45,916
she is my child…

710
00:49:46,387 --> 00:49:47,819
You know she is my child too.

711
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:50,859
Listen, I think we need to stay calm here.

712
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:53,432
Or you say is it ok for her to be gay?

713
00:49:53,673 --> 00:49:54,914
No, it's not what I am saying.

714
00:49:56,044 --> 00:49:58,492
Don’t you think I wanna walk down the isle.

714
00:49:58,492 --> 00:50:00,492
To have grandchildren, just like you do?

715
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:02,301
I don't want my child to be gay.

716
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:05,017
But she is our daughter

717
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,457
and we have to find a way to help her through this.

718
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:10,763
I am not going to help her through this.

719
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,804
I am not going to help her become a lesbian.

719
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,804
I didn't I ask you to do that!

720
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:17,410
It’s not what I am saying.

721
00:50:18,846 --> 00:50:20,611
But we can't just pretend this haven't been happening.

722
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:23,707
We can't turn her back on her.

723
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,219
or this will tear us apart.

724
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,085
What we gonna do?

725
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:39,229
Jane told she is gay last night.

726
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,281
I know.

727
00:50:42,378 --> 00:50:43,246
You know?

728
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,712
How do you know?

729
00:50:45,894 --> 00:50:47,593
She came by the other day and told me.

730
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:49,741
She told you?

731
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:53,062
Why didn't she tell me?

731
00:50:53, 0622 --> 00:50:56,062
Because it's her decision to tell you, not mine.

732
00:50:56,694 --> 00:50:57,815
But you're my friend.

733
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,512
You should tell me.

734
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:03,054
She was terrified of losing you.

735
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:04,198
Terrified you'll hate her.

736
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:07,601
She needs to tell when she was ready.

737
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:09,862
I have to do something.

737
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:10,862
Like what?

737
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:12,862
You’re a friend with me.

738
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,984
You love me and I am a gay.

738
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,984
Why can't you do that with Jane?

739
00:51:16,984 --> 00:51:19,490
Because I don't want her have a hard life like you have.

740
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,669
It’s not your place to judge my life!

741
00:51:23,669 --> 00:51:24,742
or anyone else's…

741
00:51:24,742 --> 00:51:26,742
Jimmy!

742
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:27,768
Oh come on.

742
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,768
I am not blind. I have been there

742
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:33,768
I have seen that, how cruel people
have been to you, have told to you.

743
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:38,437
Been you're only concern she has been
not becoming one of those people.

744
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:42,026
This is my life, this is who I am,

745
00:51:43,148 --> 00:51:45,587
and Jane should be able
to be who she is too

746
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,597
even if this is not who you want her to be.

746
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:49,248
No!

747
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:51,050
As long as she is my responsibility

748
00:51:52,552 --> 00:51:54,077
I have to save her from all of these.

749
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:56,962
Jennis, don't be like this

750
00:51:58,177 --> 00:52:00,337
or you'll regret till the day you die.

751
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,440
Then that would be my choice.

752
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:26,148
Jane it really would be a better use of time together
if you said something during our sessions.

753
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,792
Like what?


754
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:31,420
Like why do you think you're here?

755
00:52:32,363 --> 00:52:35,395
Because my mother said I have to come,
and do as shorter as I can.

756
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,472
Sharing with you wasn't part of the deal.

757
00:52:39,472 --> 00:52:40,779
Why are your so mad at your mother?

758
00:52:41,922 --> 00:52:43,993
Oh, I don't know…

759
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:47,489
Because she is a bigot.

760
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:51,337
That’s good that's a start.

761
00:52:51,912 --> 00:52:53,430
Really?

762
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:54,819
Where are you now?

763
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,477
I have been wasting time then.

764
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:03,262
Therapy hasn't changed a thing.

765
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,162
I try to keep her away from Taylor

765
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:06,162
but I can lock her up

766
00:53:06,162 --> 00:53:08,284
and Jimmy is no help.

766
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:10,284
He’s on Jane's line, of course.

766
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:15,284
What?

767
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:17,006
Nothing

767
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:18,006
What Beth?

768
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:20,290
I don't know.

769
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:23,216
You have always been so liberal-minded…

769
00:53:23,216 --> 00:53:25,216
I think you are overreacting.

769
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:27,216
It is probably just a phase
she is going through.

770
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:30,438
Oh, I pray it is. What if it isn't?
What do I do then?

770
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:32,438
Then it isn't when you accept.

771
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:35,162
She is your child Jennis, whatever happens you accept.

772
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,094
What if I can't.

773
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:38,499
Then you wouldn't be a very good mother.

774
00:53:39,147 --> 00:53:39,940
Excuse me?

775
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:44,051
This is coming from someone who has absolutely no
Relationship, who is capable of loving them?

776
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:46,635
How nice must be you have judge from far.

777
00:53:46,528 --> 00:53:52,260
You asked for my opinion so don't attack me to defend Jane. Maybe you should take a look why this bothers you so much.

778
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:54,562
I am sorry, you know absolutely nothing about this.

779
00:53:55,562 --> 00:53:58,797
You know why? Why don't you just take this condescending crap and pad it somewhere else.

780
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:05,082
So, how's therapy?

781
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:07,076
Sucks. 

782
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:08,262
Do you have to go again? 

783
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:11,027
Yeah. My mother thinks it'll convert me.

784
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,184
Heh. Believe me, if that were true, a lot of queers would flock to therapists.

785
00:54:15,808 --> 00:54:18,311
I mean... life would be easier if we were straight. 

786
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:25,146
But who wants easy, right? Who wants to fit into this mold? We're trailblazers

787
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:27,131
unique and to ourselves.

788
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,839
-We're special. 
-Yeah. We're special alright.

789
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,105
We can't even go anywhere.

790
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:35,752
Nowhere is safe.  

791
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:39,652
Yes we can.

791
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,652
Can you get out the house Friday night?

792
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:45,583
I will even if I have to throw myself out of my window.

793
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:02,685
They can be this. People in this town isn't humanely possible.

793
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:06,685
We are everywhere in every cities. We just wanna hide against to these people.

794
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:37,035
- Where have you been? It's 4 in the morning.

795
00:55:37,493 --> 00:55:39,319
I was out. Let’s just leave it at that.

796
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,765
No, we won't leave it at that.

797
00:55:41,765 --> 00:55:43,582
You’re grounded for a month.

797
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:45,582
We’ll take you to school, we will pick you up from school.

797
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:47,582
We’ll set you up to alone just if we have to.

798
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:49,167
That’s what you ever do us to.

798
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:51,167
You can't do that.

799
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:51,891
- Oh yes we can.
- Now go to your room.

800
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:58,133
Acting out is a strange thing.

801
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:00,475
No one ever wins…

802
00:56:00,683 --> 00:56:02,200
But you don't know that when you are doing it..

803
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:21,310
Jane, we have to talk about this.

804
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:23,471
What’s there to talk about?

805
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:27,757
My mom can't look at me, you are disappointed at me, what else is to talk about?

806
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,726
Fine, then we talk about it.

807
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,118
You have to understand.

808
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:35,920
This is not just normal growing up pains.

809
00:56:36,944 --> 00:56:39,414
This is a decision could form the rest of your life.

810
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:41,880
That’s why your mother and I so upset about this.

811
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:43,809
I understand that…

811
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,809
But this isn't easy for me either.

812
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,987
And parents are supposed to love their kids no matter what.

813
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:55,461
Jane, I will always love you, no matter what.

814
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:56,941
That doesn't feel that way to me.

815
00:57:04,976 --> 00:57:06,629
- Sorry.
- It’s ok.

816
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:10,374
I just want to tell you that I am still your friend.

816
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:12,374
No matter who you sleep with.

817
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:18,615
I can't believe she'll ground you for a whole month.

818
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,110
Isn’t therapy enough for the punishment?

819
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:22,749
Only if you have to go.

820
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,094
This isn't gonna work Jane.

821
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:30,029
What?

822
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,125
Us

822
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,125
I mean, I really like you, but...

822
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,125
This is getting out of control.

822
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,125
It’s not worthy.

823
00:57:40,143 --> 00:57:43,030
But why should we let another people to decide what's the best for us?

802
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:46,439
Jane, I have more relationships than you

803
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:49,248
and I guess I just don't get attached.

804
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:51,497
It’s easy for me to have them.

804
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:53,497
As it's not to have them.

805
00:57:55,592 --> 00:57:57,810
But I love you.

806
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,219
No, you don't.

807
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,884
You barely know me.

807
00:58:00,884 --> 00:58:02,884
You just think you do 
because I’m your first.

808
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,399
You will get over it

809
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,085
You will get over me…

810
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:09,752
Just better this way.

811
00:58:55,973 --> 00:58:57,102
What happened?

812
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:00,081
I’m gay and everyone hates me.

813
00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:02,693
They don't hates you,
they are kids.

814
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:06,482
What did they do? 
Did they say something to you?

815
00:59:08,075 --> 00:59:09,669
Taylor just broke up with me.

816
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:13,736
She never really care about me 
at the first place.

817
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:15,500
That's not true!
Of course, she did!

818
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:16,869
No, she didn't.


819
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:20,065
She just flings to her.
She just cares herself.


820
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:24,046
I'm sorry…

821
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:29,995
I just wanna die…

822
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:34,769
You don't understand.

823
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:40,707
Yes, I do.

824
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:42,882
First girl I dated dump me, too.

825
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:47,548
What did you say?

826
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:52,399
I swear I thought I just heard you say you dated a girl.

827
00:59:52,399 --> 00:59:54,236
I did.

828
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,008
No way!

828
00:59:57,008 --> 00:59:59,984
Yes.

829
00:59:59,984 --> 01:00:01,813
I’m still dating girls, Jane…

829
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:02,813
I’m gay.

830
01:00:04,000--> 01:00:05,000
Oh my god!

831
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:06,200
But nobody knows

831
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,200
so I’d appreciate it if u don't tell anyone.
 
831
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
I swear.

831
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,200
I know it seems like the end of the world but it's not.


832
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:19,468
When I was 16

832
01:00:19,468 --> 01:00:22,468
I fell madly in love.

832
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:23,468
Her name is Barbara and I thought

833
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,002
I would spend all my rest life with her.


834
01:00:26,313 --> 01:00:29,323
But we didn’t even know what a life was then…

835
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:32,256
Has been with anyone we haven't done anything.
How would we know anything?

836
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:36,274
And when she dump me to date the football star.

837
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:38,224
I thought I die, too.

838
01:00:40,415 --> 01:00:42,386
What did you do?

838
01:00:42,386 --> 01:00:43,970
I didn't die

839
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,844
but it took me some time to get over her.

840
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,527
Eventually I did and we became friends.

841
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:49,932
We still are.

842
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:53,172
When did u know...

843
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:56,120
I mean really know 

844
01:00:56,539 --> 01:00:57,844
that you were gay?

845
01:00:57,844 --> 01:00:58,558
That wasn’t a phase?

845
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:00,368
Almost from the start.

846
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:02,052
It’s not that I didn’t like man…

847
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:04,897
It’s just I felt

848
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:08,283
connected to women in a different kind of way.

849
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:10,954
A way that I’ve never felt with a man

850
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:14,223
even though I try over and over again

851
01:01:14,903 --> 01:01:17,283
to please my mother
to please other people

852
01:01:17,283 --> 01:01:18,186
to be like them.

853
01:01:18,186 --> 01:01:22,215
but I wasn't like them.
I was me.

854
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:26,891
How long did u take to get over Barbara?

855
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,366
A couple of years.

856
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:30,851
I’m kidding!

856
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:32,851
But it will take some time.

857
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,873
An open heart is easily wounded and it's hard to repair.

858
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,963
I have to pick up Brad at Jeff's after dinner.

859
01:01:47,492 --> 01:01:48,273
I will go.

859
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:49,273
Ok

860
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,971
Jane, what's the matter?

861
01:02:04,247 --> 01:02:07,606
Besides the fact that I live with stubborns?

861
01:02:07,606 --> 01:02:10,606
You’ll be happy to know that Taylor broke with me today

862
01:02:12,714 --> 01:02:14,052
because of you.

863
01:02:19,947 --> 01:02:22,548
Honey, it'll be ok…

864
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:26,104
Maybe they'll put an end to this nonsense.

865
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,015
It isn't nonsense to me.

866
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:37,145
Thanks God, Janice.

866
01:02:37,145 --> 01:02:39,145
She’s hurting.
Can’t you be a mother for a minute?

867
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:42,942
Don’t concern yourself...

868
01:02:43,545 --> 01:02:44,698
What I should be?

868
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:46,698
It’s all about you, you know?

869
01:02:46,903 --> 01:02:48,890
no, it isn’t maybe you should concern yourself

869
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,248
with the fact that your daughter could ruin her life.

870
01:02:51,248 --> 01:02:53,284
I’ll tell u what I’m concerned about.

870
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:55,284
I’m concerned about the fact that my daughter gonna broke her heart.

871
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:57,350
That’s what I’m concerned about.

872
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,773
I wasn't sorry about how I felt

872
01:03:04,773 --> 01:03:06,773
but believe it or not

872
01:03:06,773 --> 01:03:08,773
I was sorry about tearing my parents apart.

873
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:35,559
If one don't just concerning remember their first love
maybe they would not think we are so wrong.

874
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:55,259
Where you've been?

875
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:57,822
Out

876
01:03:57,822 --> 01:03:59,938
You’ve been drinking?

877
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:01,740
Yes

877
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,740
What are you thinking about?

878
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,648
You’re ground, again

879
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:04,619
Why?

879
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,619
Because you’re 16 years old

879
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:09,619
and as long as you're in this house,
you will do what we say

880
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:10,567
or I’ll lock you!

881
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:17,244
Where’s your little girlfriend?

882
01:04:18,507 --> 01:04:19,827
Just walk away Elisabeth.

884
01:04:20,154 --> 01:04:22,312
Who is gonna make me? 

885
01:04:22,312 --> 01:04:23,744
I will

885
01:04:23,744 --> 01:04:26,744
That’s right, you are a dyke now, ain't you?

886
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:34,718
It’s nonsense, stop it. Stop it!

887
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:39,329
Whenever say it's the best year of your life, it's a liar.

888
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:41,618
Hello Mrs Madison.

888
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:43,618
I’m sorry. I came over as soon as I could.

889
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:45,293
I’m glad you are here.

890
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:47,219
We can't stand any violence around here.

891
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:50,706
That' why I suspending Jane.
Now I’m sorry.

892
01:04:50,949 --> 01:04:52,071
I understand.

893
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:54,842
I’m sorry for any trouble that Jane has caused.

894
01:04:54,842 --> 01:04:56,824
You don't have to apologize for me.

894
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:58,824
Somebody has to.
Come on come on, let's go!

895
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:00,241
Come on!

896
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:07,864
-Let go off me!
-What? You gonna hit me, too?

897
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:11,201
Hey, lesbo, if you are with me, you needn't be a dyke!

897
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:11,201
Right, man.

898
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:19,106
Why do you care with these?
You just like them.

899
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,170
Jane!

900
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:27,365
-Get off me!
-Come on!

901
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:37,760
I’m not even gonna ask you 

901
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,760
to explain what you did, because 
there is no more explanation.

902
01:05:41,455 --> 01:05:43,967
Jane, you can't resolve things this way.

903
01:05:44,502 --> 01:05:48,200
Why not? Elizabeth started it.
She’s making fun Taylor of me.

904
01:05:48,614 --> 01:05:51,058
Does u blame her?
What are you doing isn't normal.

905
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:54,222
Jimmy is normal? Mrs Walcott is normal?

906
01:06:01,342 --> 01:06:02,473
What did you say?

907
01:06:04,262 --> 01:06:07,101
Nothing, I accidentally said her name.
I just mean Jimmy.

908
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:11,123
You said Mrs Walcott is normal.

909
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,041
Is Mrs Walcott gay?

910
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:20,316
Jane, is your teacher gay?

911
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:25,433
Yes, but it doesn't matter.

911
01:06:25,433 --> 01:06:27,433
Of course it matters!

912
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,624
She has influence over you.

913
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:31,553
She’s misusing it.

914
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,284
She’s the only good thing at that damned school.

915
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,978
Oh I have say about that!

916
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:39,478
No please, don't hurt Mrs Walcott!
Please mom!

917
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:41,629
Please don't anything!
I’m dying!

918
01:06:42,284 --> 01:06:44,268
-Janice, please don't do this!
-No!

919
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:48,306
No, please…

919
01:06:48,306 --> 01:06:50,306
Why she's doing this?

920
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:52,231
It’s ok.

921
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,239
Janice, come on.

922
01:07:05,198 --> 01:07:06,838
Mrs Walcott?

923
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:07,330
Yes

924
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,631
-I’m Janice Taylor, Jane's mother.
-It’s nice to meet you.

925
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:11,515
Stay away from my daughter

925
01:07:11,515 --> 01:07:14,515
Well, that'll be difficult coz I’m a teacher.

926
01:07:14,515 --> 01:07:16,003
You are also gay and you influencing her.

926
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:19,003
Unless you would like me to go to school board 
which I perfectly prepare to do.

926
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:21,003
Just stay away from my daughter.

928
01:07:47,748 --> 01:07:48,460
Jane?

929
01:07:52,974 --> 01:07:56,103
Your father and I thought we have 
to do something about your behaviour.

930
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:58,581
We try to talking to you, punishing you

930
01:07:58,581 --> 01:08:00,581
and therapy doesn't work at all.

931
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:05,176
So... We decide we should send you away to a boarding school.

932
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,049
I won't go!

933
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,539
I like the school I’m in.

934
01:08:10,057 --> 01:08:11,377
It’s not your choice.

935
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:13,176
It’s not what we want to do.

936
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:15,820
Well, I’ll run away.

937
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,639
They can't watch me 24 hours a day.

938
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:20,445
Maybe you prefer our bound.

939
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:24,463
I don't care…
Do what you have to do.

940
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:26,200
Jane!

941
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:27,731
-Jane!
-let her go.

942
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,169
How do we getta here?

943
01:08:32,686 --> 01:08:34,588
-You know how we gotta here.
-no I don't!

943
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:36,588
I don't want to send her away.

944
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,659
I’m not gonna let you make this my fault.

945
01:09:01,098 --> 01:09:03,006
Jane, what are you doing here?

946
01:09:03,635 --> 01:09:05,134
Come in.

947
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:09,586
Are you ok?

948
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:15,391
-Lynn? What’s?
-Honey, this is Jane.

949
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:18,722
Hi Jane. I heard a lot about you.

950
01:09:20,182 --> 01:09:21,804
Want tea or something?

951
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:23,520
You want some tea?

952
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,403
no, thanks.

952
01:09:24,403 --> 01:09:28,852
I’m back to sleep.
I must get up early.

953
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:31,381
Nice to meet u, hang in there.

954
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:33,417
Come on here, sit down.

954
01:09:34,381 --> 01:09:35,417
what’s going on?

954
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,417
I’m so sorry.

955
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:39,818
I never meant to hurt you.

956
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:41,673
Oh sweetie, you didn’t.

957
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:45,365
It’s gonna be ok.

958
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:46,059
It won't be.

959
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:50,870
My parents are sending me away.
They’re kicking me out.

960
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,833
They hate me.

961
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:53,831
Everybody hates me.

962
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:56,427
I don't know what to do
I have nowhere to go.

962
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:59,427
I just want to disappear.

964
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:02,985
I don't want to live anymore.

964
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:05,012
It’s gonna be ok, sweetie. I swear. 

965
01:10:05,012 --> 01:10:07,093
It’s gonna be ok…

966
01:10:23,182 --> 01:10:26,932
I know I’m the last person you expected and the last person that you wanted to see

967
01:10:27,376 --> 01:10:30,224
but Jane run away tonight
and she came to my house.

968
01:10:30,577 --> 01:10:31,866
Is she there, now?

969
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:33,913
-Yes
-Would please give us your address to come to get her?

970
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,359
No, first, you gonna listen what I have to say to you.

971
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,497
And after that you could do 
whatever you need to do.

972
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:45,658
I know you think it isn't my place to say
anything to you about your daughter.

972
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,658
But someone has to…

973
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,420
I understand

974
01:10:51,108 --> 01:10:53,549
but I also understand Jane’s pain.

975
01:10:53,773 --> 01:10:55,228
The pain having people hates you not based on you

975
01:10:55,228 --> 01:10:59,228
but based on what I think 
we have a little control over.

976
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:02,042
Well, that's where we disagree.

977
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:05,518
Look, you make your choice, frankly,

978
01:11:05,518 --> 01:11:06,015
it’s not my business.

979
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:12,437
I just don't think you should be teaching young girls

980
01:11:12,437 --> 01:11:15,119
and supporting alternative lifestyles

981
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:18,429
just because they haven't to be yours.

982
01:11:20,304 --> 01:11:22,788
Don’t you understand, Jane?

983
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,095
And girls like Jane

984
01:11:26,212 --> 01:11:27,969
are impressionable.

985
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:30,887
They look up to their teachers.

986
01:11:33,107 --> 01:11:34,944
They want to be just like them.

987
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:38,639
Just let me finish what I have to say to you

988
01:11:39,737 --> 01:11:42,229
and after that, if you want to go to school board. So be it.

989
01:11:43,457 --> 01:11:45,576
But in the meantime

990
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:51,517
your child that you give birth to is in a agony
and it doesn't need to be.

991
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:54,985
Jane run away tonight because
she thinks that you hate her.

992
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:57,316
And I know what' that like.

993
01:11:57,659 --> 01:11:58,534
It’s awful.

994
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:01,636
No child should have to go through that.

995
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:04,292
Jane’s a good person.

996
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,604
Being gay not make her a bad one.

997
01:12:07,325 --> 01:12:10,012
She’s still the same person that
you adore two weeks ago.

998
01:12:10,287 --> 01:12:12,246
I still adore my daughter.

999
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:16,414
I just want to protect her from people like you.

1000
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:17,838
Jane, let her talk.

1001
01:12:19,177 --> 01:12:23,779
Jane’s only crying is that she loves 
differently that you do

1002
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:27,129
and you don't have to understand it

1003
01:12:27,572 --> 01:12:28,872
and even agree with it.

1004
01:12:29,255 --> 01:12:30,684
But unless you try to

1005
01:12:31,326 --> 01:12:33,311
you gonna lose her... forever.

1006
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:36,417
I appreciate your concern, but I think 
we know our daughter better than you do.

1007
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:37,985
Really?

1007
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:40,985
Did you know your daughter
came to my house tonight?

1007
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,985
Thinking suicide is one of her options.

1008
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:06,906
Can I speak to Jane alone please?

1008
01:13:06,906 --> 01:13:08,906
Sure, I’ll be right there.

1009
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:21,545
Hi

1010
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:36,340
Mrs Walcott came over tonight

1011
01:13:36,843 --> 01:13:38,480
and told us something 

1012
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,979
I never considered before.

1013
01:13:44,137 --> 01:13:46,947
She said if I continue to behave

1014
01:13:48,244 --> 01:13:50,129
the way I behaved

1015
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,616
then I will lose you permanently.

1016
01:13:57,718 --> 01:13:58,765
I’m your mother

1017
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:00,656
and I love you

1018
01:14:02,003 --> 01:14:03,506
and I don't wanna lose you.

1019
01:14:12,286 --> 01:14:14,261
When you first told us

1020
01:14:15,499 --> 01:14:16,524
I thought

1021
01:14:18,617 --> 01:14:20,355
I’ve done wrong as a mother

1022
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:23,361
and

1023
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:26,904
I did think

1024
01:14:28,174 --> 01:14:31,192
what would people say
what'll I tell my friends.

1025
01:14:36,212 --> 01:14:38,377
But my first reaction

1026
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:43,644
was I didn't want your life to
be any hard as it has to be.

1027
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:50,620
The world is not a nice place

1028
01:14:55,122 --> 01:14:58,537
and I guess I had the same dream as
every mother has with their little girl.

1029
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:06,018
Let you meet a good man.

1030
01:15:06,772 --> 01:15:08,350
You fall in love.

1031
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,599
You get married.

1032
01:15:10,599 --> 01:15:11,250
Have children...

1032
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,250
Those are your dreams

1033
01:15:14,956 --> 01:15:16,156
I know that.

1034
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:25,563
Can I ask you a question?

1034
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,563
Yeah

1035
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,929
When did first feel that you were a...

1036
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:37,503
A lesbian?

1037
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,152
It’s ok, you can say it without becoming one.

1038
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,811
OH god, you are exhausting something.

1039
01:15:51,642 --> 01:15:52,405
Sorry

1040
01:15:55,982 --> 01:15:57,137
I guess

1041
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:00,759
I always know that I was different.

1042
01:16:02,007 --> 01:16:05,839
I didn’t feel a part of things.

1043
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:09,008
I’m not sure when it became clear.

1044
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:11,936
Probably last year…

1045
01:16:14,184 --> 01:16:16,789
But I guess it always be inside of me.

1046
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:21,415
What' the hardest part of it?

1047
01:16:23,785 --> 01:16:25,912
The people you care about will hate you.

1048
01:16:28,568 --> 01:16:30,281
I never gonna hate you.

1049
01:16:33,636 --> 01:16:36,661
I don't think I’m gonna change.
I know you want me to, so...

1050
01:16:38,323 --> 01:16:39,498
What do we do?

1051
01:16:41,403 --> 01:16:42,440
I don't know…

1052
01:16:47,663 --> 01:16:48,981
Just try harder.

1053
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:52,816
I will if you will.

1054
01:16:59,176 --> 01:17:00,675
I don't know…

1055
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:04,119
...if I’ll ever gonna accept it.

1056
01:17:05,098 --> 01:17:06,598
But frankly...

1057
01:17:07,737 --> 01:17:10,570
I don't know if I can understand
what are you doing, but...

1058
01:17:14,316 --> 01:17:15,904
Take it day by day.

1059
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,371
An hour ago I didn't think I had a mother.

1060
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:34,579
But now I think I’m maybe meeting her
for the very first time.

1061
01:17:41,106 --> 01:17:43,244
Thanks for not telling anyone about Mrs Walcott.

1062
01:17:43,673 --> 01:17:44,469
You are welcome.

1063
01:17:46,377 --> 01:17:49,113
What?

1064
01:17:49,113 --> 01:17:51,533
Because you're still having a hard time accepting this

1065
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,827
I’d like you to come to a meeting with me.

1066
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:56,471
It’s for parents with gay kids.

1067
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,838
It’s called PFLAG.

1067
01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:58,838
What kind of name with that?

1068
01:17:59,737 --> 01:18:03,300
It stands for parents, friends, 
and family of lesbians and gays.

1069
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:07,025
Ah... What will we do there?

1070
01:18:15,965 --> 01:18:17,368
-Come on!
-Coming, don't pull me!

1072
01:18:19,355 --> 01:18:21,369
Hi, welcome to PFLAG!

1072
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:22,369
I’m Dorothy, and my son is gay.

1073
01:18:23,285 --> 01:18:25,884
This is my mother, Janice
and her daughter is a lesbian.

1074
01:18:26,846 --> 01:18:27,688
That would be me.

1075
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:30,939
It’s hard to say it at first

1075
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,973
being a presenter to be saying to everyone.

1076
01:18:32,973 --> 01:18:34,144
Oh really?

1077
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:35,573
When will that be?

1078
01:18:39,977 --> 01:18:41,736
First I thought it was me.

1079
01:18:42,335 --> 01:18:46,865
Then I thought...what people will think 

1080
01:18:46,865 --> 01:18:48,920
about me?

1081
01:18:49,153 --> 01:18:50,858
What a kind of a horrible mother am I?

1082
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:53,541
Then when

1083
01:18:54,369 --> 01:18:58,168
I almost lost my child because of

1084
01:18:58,384 --> 01:18:59,911
my ignorance.

1085
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,760
I found her again,

1086
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:05,380
and who she was

1087
01:19:07,281 --> 01:19:09,902
was exactly who she always meant to be.

1088
01:19:12,109 --> 01:19:13,341
Good child.

1089
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:16,489
Kind child.
my...

1090
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,441
My child, excuse me…

1091
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:27,534
When I came to realize

1092
01:19:29,415 --> 01:19:30,975
was that none of this,

1093
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,100
has anything to do with us.

1094
01:19:36,046 --> 01:19:37,507
It’s their lives

1095
01:19:38,626 --> 01:19:42,708
We are their parents,
need to let them live their lives.

1096
01:19:43,926 --> 01:19:45,044
Is they safe at?

1097
01:19:46,141 --> 01:19:49,039
Not as we safe at.

1098
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:53,242
Thank you.

1099
01:19:58,538 --> 01:19:59,842
Ring a bell?

1100
01:20:04,081 --> 01:20:05,237
I got it.

1101
01:20:06,544 --> 01:20:08,775
Oh, thanks!
thank u!

1102
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,334
Oh, don't even think about that.

1103
01:20:19,395 --> 01:20:20,800
He’s my friend.

1104
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,241
Nothing more, nothing less.

1104
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:23,494
She’s still a dyke, mom.

1105
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:26,243
And she's still your sister,
so watch your mouth!

1106
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:33,276
Just go to hell!

1107
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:37,767
May I catch that, please?
Thank you.

1108
01:20:47,195 --> 01:20:48,286
I’m really proud of you!

1109
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:51,812
don't be.

1110
01:20:56,047 --> 01:20:58,186
Have I ever say anything

1111
01:20:59,469 --> 01:21:01,616
to act as you

1112
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:07,101
as if you...understand or

1113
01:21:08,066 --> 01:21:09,439
accept something.

1114
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:12,836
When you really don't

1115
01:21:17,363 --> 01:21:19,051
unless what I’m doing

1116
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,244
acting as if

1117
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,055
because it still breaks my heart.

1118
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:45,733
- Did you want to say something?
- No.

1119
01:21:48,078 --> 01:21:48,870
Thanks

1120
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,965
But you can't protect me forever.

1120
01:21:51,965 --> 01:21:53,965
No, but when I can I hope you allow me

1121
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:58,615
what happens to you.

1122
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:01,380
Someone call me a fag head.

1122
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,380
It won't saying, I’m not a fag.

1123
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:05,889
I beat the crap out in many ways.

1124
01:22:08,754 --> 01:22:12,503
At that moment if I had been straight,
I’d marry the man right in there.

1125
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:20,659
You are ok about Taylor moving back to east?

1126
01:22:21,196 --> 01:22:22,746
Yeah, thanks.

1127
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:25,081
Is this great?

1128
01:22:26,799 --> 01:22:30,095
Dad ,don't think I’ll suddenly like sports because I’m gay!

1129
01:22:30,723 --> 01:22:32,199
How about fishing?

1130
01:22:33,925 --> 01:22:35,383
Sports go to out of question!

1131
01:22:37,609 --> 01:22:39,269
So what do lesbian like to do?

1132
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:43,623
Same things like you to do.

1133
01:22:45,463 --> 01:22:46,488
Can we go home now?

1134
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:49,719
Yeah, sure.

1135
01:23:00,284 --> 01:23:01,515
-Hi!
-Hi!

1136
01:23:03,415 --> 01:23:05,136
I’d like to see you guys.

1137
01:23:05,377 --> 01:23:07,347
Who the hell think this is a fun?

1137
01:23:07,347 --> 01:23:11,347
Lose a tiny piece, you barely seemly 
as much as fun and u still blow your brain out.

1138
01:23:11,347 --> 01:23:12,998
- Can I go Jess's house?
- Go, go!

1138
01:23:13,347 --> 01:23:14,634
Nice, Lord.

1139
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:17,716
-You guys have fun?
-Yeah, tell her that time about us…

1140
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:21,886
Can I talk to you guys for a minute?

1140
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:24,886
Sure

1141
01:23:25,832 --> 01:23:29,117
I appreciate all that what you are doing to
try to be a part of my life

1142
01:23:29,453 --> 01:23:32,157
and to show me you love me
even though I’m gay.

1143
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:36,041
But you don't need to try acquitting so hard.

1144
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:39,175
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1145
01:23:49,586 --> 01:23:51,448
Hi, Janice, glad you here.
How’s Jane?

1146
01:23:52,002 --> 01:23:53,295
She’s going , thank you.

1147
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:55,098
And you?

1148
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:57,444
I’m trying.

1149
01:24:00,308 --> 01:24:02,657
My name is Lorraine
and my daughter is a lesbian…

1150
01:24:03,656 --> 01:24:05,428
I’m susan, and my son is gay…

1151
01:24:08,358 --> 01:24:11,651
My name is Janice, and...

1152
01:24:12,205 --> 01:24:15,780
It’s ok,
let's start to meeting now.

1153
01:24:24,097 --> 01:24:25,945
What do you want?

1154
01:24:25,945 --> 01:24:27,666
I’m not gonna hurt you.

1154
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:28,604
And what do you want?

1155
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:30,346
I bought you this.

1156
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:33,325
Why’d you give me a present?

1157
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:35,795
I never be nice in my whole life.

1158
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:38,862
I know, I never been nice to you either

1159
01:24:39,444 --> 01:24:41,573
so I thought I’ll try.

1160
01:24:41,573 --> 01:24:43,095
I won't tell people you were gay.

1160
01:24:43,095 --> 01:24:44,095
I know…

1161
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:47,150
- It’s a trick ,isn’t it?
- No.

1162
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:49,138
I don't get it.

1163
01:24:50,049 --> 01:24:52,907
There’s a thing

1164
01:24:52,907 --> 01:24:53,353
killing with kindness

1164
01:24:53,353 --> 01:24:55,353
and in a few years, you'll know what I means.

1165
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,603
Why can't I eat at Jess's house?

1166
01:24:59,604 --> 01:25:01,360
Because we have more family dinners

1167
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,717
- Why?
- Because your blood is punishment.

1168
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,681
Because we are family, son.

1169
01:25:07,193 --> 01:25:09,473
That’s in the eye to beholder.

1169
01:25:09,473 --> 01:25:11,473
If you didn't accept you'll be hold to your room.

1170
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:14,562
How’s PFLAG meeting going ,Janice?

1171
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,805
Good... Good…

1172
01:25:18,517 --> 01:25:22,980
You have these gay pride parade next week.

1173
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:26,613
- I don't mind, it's feel a trip.
- Great, great!

1174
01:25:27,112 --> 01:25:28,649
Good for you.

1175
01:25:28,936 --> 01:25:32,740
Well I don't think I’ll be going,
I mean, I’m getting better

1176
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,079
but I don't think I can shout from the roof tops yet.

1177
01:25:41,206 --> 01:25:43,402
One step forward, one step backwards…

1178
01:25:55,292 --> 01:25:56,071
Jane!

1179
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,393
Can I come in?

1180
01:26:09,225 --> 01:26:12,204
Look, I’m doing my best I can,
sometimes stinks,

1181
01:26:14,554 --> 01:26:16,459
but I’ll get better, I promise…

1182
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:18,188
When?

1183
01:26:19,631 --> 01:26:22,686
going to meetings, acknowledging you a gay,

1184
01:26:23,568 --> 01:26:24,784
I can do it pretty well

1185
01:26:25,274 --> 01:26:29,469
but it's all on private,
it's still safe.

1185
01:26:29,469 --> 01:26:31,469
You don't really accept me unless you do it out in the open.

1186
01:26:36,212 --> 01:26:37,167
I’m sorry…

1187
01:26:40,468 --> 01:26:41,028
I can't

1188
01:26:44,995 --> 01:26:47,027
going as fast as I can.

1189
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:56,702
We stand united, as Robinson sisters,
offer all human beings deserved

1190
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:01,142
equality, rights, dignity.

1191
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:06,517
The very things that other people taken
for granted are given to them...

1192
01:27:06,517 --> 01:27:11,250
Under the law, all men and women were
created equal in the eyes of my God.

1192
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:15,250
A god that is inclusive, not exclusive

1193
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:18,290
in a world we envision,

1193
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:23,290
not in a world of offences and walls.
I think that keeps people out because they are different

1193
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:25,290
but in a world that loves,

1194
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:38,681
we ask for the world for we expected from it,
not what if it gives us if it's wrong?

1195
01:27:39,191 --> 01:27:41,495
Those are the things we are still fighting for.

1196
01:27:43,913 --> 01:27:47,439
We demonstrate, protest.

1197
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:49,135
Hi, Jane!

1198
01:27:49,658 --> 01:27:51,705
You shouldn't be there, someone might see you.

1199
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:53,859
This time we did.

1200
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:00,887
Sorry, your mom isn't here.

1201
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:02,365
She’ll come around.

1202
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:03,879
What if she doesn't?

1203
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:20,440
Janice will come on stage to speak.

1204
01:28:20,778 --> 01:28:21,740
She’s not coming…

1205
01:28:22,242 --> 01:28:23,525
Oh, I’m sorry, Jane.

1206
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:26,212
It’s ok.

1207
01:28:26,212 --> 01:28:28,856
It took me 3 or 4 rounds before I came

1208
01:28:28,856 --> 01:28:31,053
but you are here, it's a start.

1208
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:33,053
We’ll see u guys later.

1208
01:28:35,856 --> 01:28:38,053
[ladies and gentlemen, the PFLAG moms]

1209
01:28:46,997 --> 01:28:51,708
Hi, I’m Dorothy, and my son is gay.

1210
01:28:59,594 --> 01:29:01,778
I’m Madoon, my daughter is lesbian,

1211
01:29:03,314 --> 01:29:05,260
I love her, and proud to be her mom.

1212
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,549
I’m Carol, my daughter is lesbian…

1213
01:29:15,082 --> 01:29:17,115
I’m Danse, and my son is gay…

1214
01:29:23,631 --> 01:29:28,190
I’m Rick, my daughter is lesbian,
I’m very proud of her.

1215
01:29:38,271 --> 01:29:40,874
The amazing thing about change is that everyone can do it,

1216
01:29:41,235 --> 01:29:43,747
even the people you least expect it from.

1217
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:50,276
My mother was the finally exactly the person
she meant to be.

1218
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:55,831
I was so proud of how well she has grown up.

1219
01:30:04,002 --> 01:30:10,831
This is dedicated to Matthew Shepard...
and to all of the men & women 
who love differently.
