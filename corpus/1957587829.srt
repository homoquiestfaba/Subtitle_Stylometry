1
00:00:01,657 --> 00:00:03,740
(sirens)

2
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:12,230
(train passing)

3
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,613
(gentle music)

4
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:01,737
(dog barking)

5
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:26,873
(gun loading)

6
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,740
(mimicking shooting noise)

7
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:49,767
(children playing on street)

8
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:07,202
(gun bang)

9
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:54,035
(alarm clock buzzing)

10
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,638
(rap music)

11
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,823
- Hat off.

12
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,310
Don't forget your sister tonight.

13
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,530
Going down to Albany.

14
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,980
Pick up some new firing pins.

15
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,350
Need this Colt taken down
to the shop to get cleaned.

16
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,445
Tell Bud I'll be in later this afternoon.

17
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:20,778
(rap music)

18
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,777
- So three guys get in the elevator.

19
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:50,010
One of them says "Hit the floor".

20
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,110
Frank goes diving on the
floor of the elevator.

21
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,460
He looks up and it's Eddie Murphy.

22
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,150
- He was in those Beverly Hill cop movies.

23
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,200
- Yeah, well the guy meant

24
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,603
hit the floor, button.

25
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:01,420
Frank's on the floor, scared to death.

26
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,253
Hi Seth.

27
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:04,268
- Hey.

28
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:11,707
(rap music)

29
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:23,888
- Hey, I had to run an errand for my pop.

30
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,050
- Jesus Seth, I'm trying
to run a business here.

31
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,177
- Yeah I know and I'm sorry Francine.

32
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,090
- Oh honey, now I'm on your side

33
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,130
but you can't keep being late.

34
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,450
Breakfast is where my money is.

35
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,683
- Yeah, I promise-

36
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:39,527
- And he said, Louis what are you doing?

37
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,838
He says, Sheriff I am taking out to bury.

38
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,870
I said Louis, you don't bury a dead cow.

39
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,710
You eat a dead cow.

40
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,513
You take it to the butcher, he cuts it up,

41
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,660
he puts it in the freezer.
In the winter you come...

42
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,387
Hey Seth, how you doin'?

43
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,860
- How you doing sweetie?

44
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,823
- Fine Mrs. Mott.

45
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,350
- You know I haven't seen
you around the house lately.

46
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,690
- Yeah, you know I've been busy.

47
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,523
Work and all.

48
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,040
- Good, good.

49
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,673
- Kristen tells me you're still painting.

50
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,970
- Yeah, a little.

51
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,763
- You know Seth won that art competition.

52
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,098
When was that?

53
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:11,853
- Just about a year and a half ago.

54
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,460
- Anything ever come of that?

55
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,293
- Yeah well you know,

56
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,180
I've been looking at
schools down in the village.

57
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,290
That's New York.

58
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,233
- Yeah, yeah I know. I've been there.

59
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:25,440
- You know Kristen won't
stop talking about New York.

60
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,940
- So Peter let you go down there, huh?

61
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,863
- Uh, you folks want your eggs scrambled?

62
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
- Never even been to New York, have you?

63
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,490
- Everyone in this town in
fucking interchangeable.

64
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,523
- What about-

65
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,590
- Kyle?

66
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,423
- Yeah.

67
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,990
He was sort of different.

68
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,093
Seth, you really want those
types of people living here?

69
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,743
On your road, dating your little sister.

70
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,683
All this nigger shit.

71
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,730
You don't even know one do you?

72
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,348
I'm taking that department of
corrections test next week.

73
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:31,143
$22,000 a year. You
oughta take that test man.

74
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
Hey Kristen.

75
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,763
- Oh hey Marty.

76
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,920
Gee, what's up homey?

77
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,800
- Ah yeah girl. That purple shit is fat.

78
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,310
- So um, guess what?

79
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,815
- You and Marty getting hitched?

80
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:55,648
- No jerk.

81
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,088
No um, I got into NYU.

82
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,933
- Did you accept?

83
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:07,752
Congratulations.

84
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:08,585
- Thanks.

85
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,873
- So we should like party or something.

86
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:13,290
- Oh, definitely.

87
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,703
- Yeah, I'll pick you up after seven.

88
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,923
See ya.

89
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,528
(honking horn)

90
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,268
- So did you get food for dinner tonight?

91
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:42,930
- Yes Sally.

92
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,955
- How about the bread.

93
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:44,893
Did you get the good bread?

94
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,823
With the seed-y things on the outside?

95
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,013
And the maple sauce.
- Yes.

96
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:48,960
- Stuff without added sugar?

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,360
- Yo will you cut it with
the Betty Cocker shit.

98
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,300
So how was school today?

99
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:03,598
- It was fine.

100
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:06,720
- How you living girl?

101
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:09,100
- Large.
- Large.

102
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,080
- Karen Walker said today,

103
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,520
that when she went to the
Empire State building,

104
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,410
see it's real tall.

105
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,000
And she and her family
had to take an elevator

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,733
to get to the top.

107
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,708
And when she walked in the elevator-

108
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,088
- Honey, don't speak with your mouth full.

109
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,310
- A black man walked in
and said, hit the button.

110
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,525
And so her whole family-

111
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,858
- Hit the floor.

112
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,253
The line is hit the floor.

113
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,220
You know that's a stupid joke.

114
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,060
You shouldn't be telling that-

115
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,893
- Seth.

116
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,683
- Pop, um,

117
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,940
I was thinking about, you
know we talked last month.

118
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
About me going to school
in New York for painting?

119
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,848
- Community college at
Saranac is almost free.

120
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:25,393
You could stay here.

121
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,465
- Right well, I've been looking
into this financial aid and-

122
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,865
- Seth, what are you going to do

123
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,565
with a college degree in painting?

124
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,098
- Kristen got into NYU.

125
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,290
(sigh)

126
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,793
Well this financial aid.

127
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,090
This financial aid see-

128
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,250
- Means I gotta sign something that says

129
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,260
I can't support my family.

130
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,820
- No pop, it ain't like that.

131
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,673
- It ain't huh?

132
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,810
Let me tell you something Mr.

133
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,930
That governor we got,

134
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,370
let's my tax dollars get
sucked down that through way,

135
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,260
like a drainpipe opening into a sewer.

136
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,510
And people down there
sit on their lazy butts

137
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,420
and get rich off of my sweat.

138
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,810
- Pop it's not welfare.

139
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,460
Look I'll pay the money back myself.

140
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,060
- I can't even get you to
do the dishes around here.

141
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,740
No I am sorry, I will not take handouts.

142
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,410
- Jesus pop, why's everything got to be

143
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,040
such a pain in the ass with you?

144
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,700
- Excuse me, that language is not allowed

145
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,533
at my dinner table.

146
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,910
- Our dinner table pop.

147
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,340
There are two other people that live

148
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,890
in this fucking house with you.

149
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,130
- Sally, go to your room.

150
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,720
When you can learn to talk like an adult

151
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,030
then we'll have a conversation.

152
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,680
- Yeah I tried pop but you don't listen.

153
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
- Goodnight.

154
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:49,345
(rap music)

155
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,150
- Yeah I'm going down state this weekend.

156
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,190
- Oh what's going on down there?

157
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,110
- Oh my son Mike's
graduating from high school.

158
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,620
- Great, is he going to college?

159
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,100
- Nah, he's going to sit it out a year.

160
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,900
You know they gotta find themselves.

161
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,610
Can I help you with something Seth?

162
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:21,588
- Uh, no.

163
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,100
(police scanner)

164
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,730
- Aight, yo yo. What do you think?

165
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,193
- Wow that's me.

166
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,313
(laughing)

167
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,480
You know Sherry.?

168
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,490
This is weird.

169
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,260
When I was like like, um, I was like 14,

170
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,578
um I decided,

171
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,575
I wasn't going to shave my armpits.

172
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:11,300
(snorts)

173
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,133
- Mm-hm.

174
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,880
- Okay and so, she and
like all of her friends

175
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,900
they followed me around
for like two weeks.

176
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
With cans of rite guard.

177
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,150
(laughing)

178
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,243
They would like spray it
at me, like in my face.

179
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,628
And like I showered everyday you know?

180
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,073
But it didn't matter.

181
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,810
And you know like, the only
one in the entire grade

182
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,653
that stuck up for me was Kyle Turner.

183
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,623
He was great man.

184
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,050
He could like, make me
laugh so hard 'cause

185
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,580
like the way he used to
put up with Marty's shit.

186
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,230
He could be like so vicious.

187
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,063
- Yeah

188
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:14,610
- And I mean like, god, we
would like we would just talk

189
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,993
forever about, about just everything.

190
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,173
- Yeah.

191
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,373
Kyle was different.

192
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,362
Seems like, I don't know.

193
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,883
Like cared about people,
you know and things.

194
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,173
- Yeah, he was different.

195
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,923
Like that's why he hung himself
with his superman bedsheets.

196
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:53,050
You know like, I always thought that was,

197
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,930
so funny.

198
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,443
Like a kid his age with
superman bedsheets.

199
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,290
- No, shut up man.

200
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,390
They are my people.
- Oh.

201
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,975
- Yeah, when I was 13 the kids in school

202
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,637

203
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,358
(laughing)

204
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,798
- Oh come here.

205
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:16,882
I think that you have beautiful lips.

206
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:19,832
- Thanks.

207
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:21,417

208
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:22,417
- Come here.

209
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,733

210
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:28,173

211
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:29,005
- Oh Seth.

212
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:30,938
- Oh Kristen.

213
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:37,053
- Do you remember the time when
we were in your mom's cabin?

214
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:38,680
We, you know.

215
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:42,660
You know?

216
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:45,345
- Yeah.

217
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:47,672
- Yeah, well.

218
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:50,670
Did you,

219
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,562

220
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,788
Did you like it?

221
00:15:59,622 --> 00:16:01,708
- Yeah it was all right.

222
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah.

223
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:05,728
- It was all right.

224
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:21,255
- All right.

225
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:22,607
- Get in, get in.

226
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,918
- Wow.

227
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,500
Yo man, I'm back in the crib.

228
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,820
- Sh, don't talk because
your dad's going to hear us.

229
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,265
- Fuck you pop.

230
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:32,718
- Come on. Come on.
- Fuck you pop.

231
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:33,768
- Sit, sit.

232
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:35,798
All right, all right. Ah.

Take your, uh, thing off.

00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,488
- All right.

235
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:40,405
Get it off.

236
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,088
- Careful, you got it?

237
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,362
- Yeah I got it.

238
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:46,330

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,230
Do you want me to,

241
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:49,033

242
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:49,867
Okay.

00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,903
What are you doin'?

244
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:55,573
Don't try to take
advantage of me, all right.

245
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,552
- Don't try to take advantage of you?

246
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,385
- No.

247
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,668
- You having fun?

248
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:02,565
(kissing)

249
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:03,398
You are?

250
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,430
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,598
(kissing)

252
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,325
Yo man, what are you doing?

253
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,158
- What?

254
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:17,992

255
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:18,825

256
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,955

00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,180
Fucking trying to touch me or shit?

259
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,250
Get the fuck out man.

260
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,510
Get out.

261
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,280
(yelling)
Get out man.

262
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Get the fuck out, you fucking bitch.

263
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:39,910
(sobbing)

264
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:21,308
(creaking floorboard)

265
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,713
- Give me the money mother fucker.

266
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,330
Give me the mother fucking money

267
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,508
before I blow your
mother fucking head off.

268
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,193
Come on!

269
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,603
- Jesus.

270
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,433
- Got anything to eat in this shit hole?

271
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,683
- Cook went home.

272
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,213
- Oh yeah?

273
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:10,213
Back the fuck up. Back up.

274
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:13,842
- There's pie.

275
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,203
- Yeah, if you got. Yeah okay.

276
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:17,287
Give me some fucking pie.

277
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,773
Hey!

278
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,173
Don't fuck with me. Okay.

279
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,283
Slow.

280
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,942
(coughing)

281
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,915
(breathing heavily)

282
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:52,025
You see that?

283
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,058
The fuck you lookin' at?

284
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:06,890
Huh.

285
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,533
I will fuck you up.

286
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,033
(sirens)

287
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,858
You got a truck, right?

288
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,993
Huh?

289
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,995
- Oh man I think you need a doctor.

290
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:33,992
- Don't fucking come near me man.

291
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:36,242
Don't fucking come near me.

292
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,777
(indistinct)

293
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,663
(groaning)

294
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:05,525
Help me.

295
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:10,810
(gasping)

296
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:32,845
Don't touch me!

297
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,240
- Dear father we come to you broken

298
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,490
praying for your healing
powers to come down

299
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,203
and touch us and comfort us.

300
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,830
Lord we thank you for this food

301
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,893
which you've placed before us.

302
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,100
Amen.

303
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,350
- [Sally] Amen.

304
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,790
- Where were you last night?

305
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,090
- Stayed out at the cabin.

306
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,600
- Need some extra blankets out there?

307
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,100
- No.

308
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,563
No, thanks.

309
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,773
- Gotta get the laundry done today.

310
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,460
- Yeah, all right.

311
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:27,058
(coughing)

312
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:47,358
(horn honking)

313
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,495
(tapping)

314
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:48,003
- Where the fuck's my gun?

315
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,663
- Got rid of it.

316
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:54,203
It's gone.

317
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,918
- Where the fuck am I?

318
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:04,580
- So this is my mom's place.

319
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,263
She used to make maple syrup here.

320
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,833
- I need some penicillin or something.

321
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,500
- Nah, you've got a
fever. You need liquids.

322
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,013
- I need some fucking penicillin.

323
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:19,633
- Here you go.

324
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,623
- Get the fuck away from me man.

325
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,607
Fucking wolf.

326
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:26,873
That fucking nigger wannabe hair's shit.

327
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,943
- My name's Seth.

328
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,903
- I could kick the shit out
of your white ass. Seth.

329
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,620
You know that right?

330
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:41,673
If I had my fucking gun I'd shoot
your whole fucking family.

331
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,700
- [Seth's Dad] Thought you
were going to do a wash today?

332
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,223
- Nah, I didn't have a chance.

333
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,083
- [Seth's Dad] Picked up rhubarb pie.

334
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:16,395
(wheezing)

335
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,160
- Where the fuck you going?

336
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,598
Fever's trying to break.

337
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:34,872
- I know what my fucking
fever's trying to do.

338
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:36,470
(coughing)

339
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,560
- Look your body just
needs to go through this.

340
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,323
- My fucking body needs antibiotics.

341
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:04,045
- You're worse than my mom.

342
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:14,235
(coughing)

343
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,332
- Look I'm just going to
chill here tonight all right?

344
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:21,665
So you know, if you need
anything, just let me know.

345
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,532
(rap music)

346
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,323
Morning.

347
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,633
Think your fever broke.

348
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,713
How's your arm?

349
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,963
- Better.

350
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,923
I'm gonna need some clean bandages though.

351
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:45,758
How far away is Canada?

352
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,883
- Ugh, about an hour by car maybe.

353
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,123
I gotta go to work.

354
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:06,583
It's all right if you stay here.

355
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:10,055
- Thanks.

356
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:27,507
- So, this is all right?

357
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,680
- Yeah, I was going to town anyway.

358
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,003
- Yo, pops.

359
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:42,120
- Yup.

360
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,250
- About that night.

361
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:48,585
Um,

362
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:52,107
I'm sorry.

363
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:55,560
- S'ok.

364
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,380
- Jesus, I heard that
colored guy that escaped

365
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,713
he killed like three guys.

366
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,810
- Black Brooks a boot camp.
An early release program.

367
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,320
You can't go there if you killed someone.

368
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,240
- Right.

369
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,090
They make you go through all
that, who am I inside, shit.

370
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,423
So did you have any
problems the other night?

371
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,900
I found blood stains on the floor.

372
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,670
- Yeah, I cut myself.

373
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,250
- Kristen, I'm talking to you young lady.

374
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,777
- What dad, what?

375
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,840
- Look sweetheart, your
mother and I just want

376
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,063
what's best for you that's all.

377
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:04,480
- I'm not going okay?

378
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,390
- Why? Two weeks ago you
couldn't wait to get outta here.

379
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,290
Now you don't want to leave?

380
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,445
What the hell's going on?

381
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,337
This scholarship's an opportunity for you.

382
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:11,428
- No, it's not for me okay?

383
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:12,432
I'm not going.

384
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:13,773
- Does this have
something to do with Seth?

385
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,068
- No, it has nothing to do with Seth.

386
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:17,490
- Well then what is it?

387
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,840
Explain it to me, tell me.

388
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,258
Your mother and I are
losing sleep over this.

389
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:22,490
- Why don't you mind your
own fucking business?

390
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,323
- Kristen.

391
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:24,600
Kristen get back here.

392
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,492
- Yo Francine, I'm outty 5000.

393
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,258
- See you tomorrow Seth.

394
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:43,258
- All right.

395
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:22,668
- Seth.

396
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,113
Hello?

397
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:47,197
Hello.

398
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,170
- Yo, what are you doing in my house man?

399
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,120
- I was just looking around.

400
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,853
- Nah, this is my fucking room.

401
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,657
Wait.

402
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,070
Yo, where are you expecting to hide man?

403
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,793
- This ain't got nothing to do with you.

404
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,193
- Then why'd you hold me up?

405
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,180
- You think you know
everything about black folks,

406
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,013
don't you?

407
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:25,520
Don't fucking touch me man.

408
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,223
Look, why don't you just back the fuck up.

409
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,038
Why you sweatin' me, white boy?

410
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:33,870
I'll bust your ass.

411
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,053
Trick ass bitch.

412
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:40,543
- All right man.

413
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,173
I give in, be a nigger.

414
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,753
- Ah!

415
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,685
Just leave me alone, okay.

416
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,723
- What are you running away from?

417
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,263
Knowledge, that's your name isn't it?

418
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,323
- Hi, this is my truck.

419
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,230
You're that guy that escaped, aren't you?

420
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,113
It's okay. It's cool.

421
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,050
- Now, you're not going to
tell anyone about his, right?

422
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,855
- I told you, I promised.

423
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:27,855
- All right.

424
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,455
- Can I tell Judy Vanderstoff?

425
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,288
- No.

426
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,080
- Knowledge, do you have a family?

427
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,913
- Sally.

428
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:48,925
- Nah, I don't have a family.

429
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,208
- Careful, it's hot.

430
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,668
- Saw the pictures of your moms.

431
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,363
She's pretty.

432
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,193
- Yeah.

433
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,697
- That graffiti in your
room, you did that?

434
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,140
- Yeah.

435
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,973
- Shit is dope.

436
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,250
You an artist or something?

437
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,058
- No, not really.

438
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,853
I don't know, maybe someday.

439
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:19,390
- You look like one.

440
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,223
- You?

441
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,743
Nah, you know before
all that shit went down.

442
00:42:31,153 --> 00:42:32,570
- I'm in college.

443
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,035
I want to be paramedic.

444
00:42:36,898 --> 00:42:38,175
- Really?

445
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:40,493
- Yeah, in Brooklyn.

446
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,963
- That's New York.

447
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,743
- Sorta.

448
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:49,563
- You know when I think about New York,

449
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,083
I think about all these crazy ideas,

450
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,833
and people and things.

451
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,603
And no one gives you shit about it.

452
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,510
- People give you shit.

453
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,010
People are always giving you shit.

454
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:14,900
I look out here, all I see is all this

455
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,590
innocence and big skies and-

456
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,813
- Have you ever seen,

457
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,913
a cross burning?

458
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:26,845
Yeah, I have.

459
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,810
- Look man,

460
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,210
don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

461
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,097
- Please, The Cosby's
were great role models?

462
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:42,310
- For who?

463
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,570
- Yo even my father
watched The Cosby show.

464
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,920
- Nobody lives like that in the city.

465
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,320
Not even the white folks.

466
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,600
Now Good Times.

467
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,070
- Haha, yeah, all right.

468
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,720
What, aint' we lucky we got it.

469
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,553
- I mean Good Times, right.

470
00:43:55,553 --> 00:43:58,150
Now Good Times I always thought it had.

471
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,820
It said more for the
African American experience.

472
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,650
- Yo Kid Dynomite, African American?

473
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,630
- Yeah, yeah you know,
kinda like how you must

474
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,543
relate to Jethro, The Beverly Hillbillies.

475
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:09,670
- Aight. No, no don't even go there.

476
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,913
Don't even try it.

477
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:11,745
- I suppose you're going to ask me

478
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:12,982
if I know Al Sharpton now.

479
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:13,815
- Who?

480
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:19,490
- Get the fuck out.
- Ow.

481
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,740
(laughing)

482
00:44:26,218 --> 00:44:29,023
- And James was real smart for 13.

483
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,470
Daddy wouldn't give in,

484
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:38,043
and I see steps up to him

485
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,093
and hits 'em right in the face.

486
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,430
Hard.

487
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,263
Boom.

488
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,083
Dropped that kid.

489
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,698
Ran like hell.

490
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
- And what'd you do?

491
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:04,135
- Nothing.

492
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,983
- Come on man, there's
something I want to show you.

493
00:45:49,592 --> 00:45:51,508
You know it's funny but

494
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,793
I can't even remember what
her voice sounded like.

495
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,170
- I never knew my pops.

496
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,240
- Did he die?

497
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,083
- Disappeared.

498
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,880
Ran off or some shit.

499
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,713
Fuck 'em.

500
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:11,563
When I was little,

501
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,730
I used to pretend he was famous and shit.

502
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,163
He was gonna come rescue me.

503
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,668
But he never did.

504
00:46:29,543 --> 00:46:30,973
How'd she die man?

505
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,390
- Cancer. It happened real quick.

506
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,458
(dog barking)

507
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,292
- Kristen?

508
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:45,368
Hey!

509
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,723
What are you doing here?

510
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,560
- Nothing.

511
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,460
- Where's Kristen?

512
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,208
- I don't know.

513
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,460
- Bull shit.

514
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,630
She didn't come home last
night and neither did you.

515
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,463
Your father told me.

516
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:01,597
Where is she?

517
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:02,430
- I don't know.

518
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:04,963
- Come here.

519
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,003
Up here.

520
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,820
I don't know what's
going on between you two.

521
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,420
But I don't you're the
reason she's passed up

522
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,253
that scholarship.

523
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:28,640
And I know you know where she is.

524
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,920
Now where is she?

525
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,900
- Sir, I swear I don't know.

526
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,888
Just came by to tell her I
was sorry about something.

527
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,338
- Here.

528
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,313
- Francine?

529
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:04,390
- Yeah, hun.

530
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,110
- You never went to college, did you?

531
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,598
- No, I didn't.

532
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,760
But I did spent two years
wandering around Europe

533
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,113
when I was about your age.

534
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,280
Your mom always told me I
learned more in two years

535
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,463
than she did in four.

536
00:49:22,153 --> 00:49:24,345
- Why'd you come back here?

537
00:49:24,345 --> 00:49:25,443
- 'Cause I wanted to.

538
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,020
- Why would anybody want to?

539
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,010
- Seth,

540
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:37,833
me and your mom came back
here 'cause we'd been away.

541
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,873
Your dad never has.

542
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,013
That's why there were
troubles between them.

543
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:54,493
Your mom, she was something else.

544
00:50:00,642 --> 00:50:03,475
- I don't want to be here anymore.

545
00:50:06,595 --> 00:50:07,428
- Then don't be.

546
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,973
- Kristen!

547
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:42,010
I thought I might find you here.

548
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,350
I ugh,

549
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,350
I remember how you used to like it here.

550
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,408
You know your parents are
going crazy looking for you.

551
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,190
You really shouldn't be out here alone.

552
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,040
- Have you seen Seth?

553
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,950
- I have something I want to show you.

554
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:06,783
It's okay.

555
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,270
That's that guy that they're looking for.

556
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,613
Who murdered all those
people in New York City.

557
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,990
I think Seth knows where he is.

558
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,763
I think,

559
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,023
something's wrong with Seth.

560
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:35,647
- Seth and I are getting married.

561
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,030
- Seth?

562
00:52:03,427 --> 00:52:04,982
Who the hell are you?

563
00:52:04,982 --> 00:52:06,232
- Where's Seth?

564
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:10,522
- He's at work.

565
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:16,280
Wait.

566
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:18,605
Hey, hey.

567
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:21,437
Hey.

568
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,375
- Don't hurt me.

569
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:24,208
- I won't.

570
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:27,905
- Please just let go.

571
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,000
- H-hey, who are you?

572
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:37,208
- No one.

573
00:52:44,488 --> 00:52:46,910
- She'll come around Sid.

574
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,228
Kids that age just need space.

575
00:52:49,228 --> 00:52:50,060
- Eh.

576
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:54,043
- When she was a little
girl she used to tell us

577
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:55,210
when the sky was blue.

578
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,788
And how you wouldn't
know we were her parents.

579
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:00,270
- I remember when you and
Pete were in high school,

580
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,110
you wanted to join the Navy.

581
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,110
Well your parents raised an awful stink.

582
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,783
- Told the recruiter we
were 19, weren't even 17.

583
00:53:08,783 --> 00:53:10,280
(laughing)

584
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,760
- Yeah, my pa was so mad,

585
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,240
wouldn't speak to me for
the rest of my senior year.

586
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,823
- Hell mine packed my bags.

587
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:18,073
(laughing)

588
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,458
- I don't know,

589
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:23,693
seems to me you can't let
your kids run too wild.

590
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,573
I should talk.

591
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,723
But Seth,

592
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:33,610
Seth's a good kid.

593
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,163
Takes good care of his sister.

594
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,480
It's just a whole lot different
nowadays raising kids.

595
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,293
So many rules.

596
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:48,838
(country music)

597
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,340
- What about your pops man?

598
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,340
- Thursdays he hangs it
with his crew in town.

599
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,690
He won't be back 'til late.

600
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,963
Yo Sally, it's time to wash up.

601
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,880
- [Sally] Okay.

602
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,693
You better not be in my room.

603
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,100
- [Sally] I'm not.

604
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,690
- So mom and dad
(coughing)

605
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,690
get this poor frozen animal.

606
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,130
And they end up putting
it back in the boat

607
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,320
they go back to the car.

608
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,230
They end up driving like two
hours to get back down here.

609
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,410
And they end up putting it
in Francine's meat locker

610
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,190
for like five months,

611
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,823
next to the frozen hamburger
patties, I swear to god.

612
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:52,663
No, I know.

613
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:54,038
- You making this up man.

614
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:57,860
- No, I swear to god it
was, it was nasty man.

615
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,110
- Liar. I swear your lying.

616
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,005
- Can you pass the corn?

617
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:07,395
(indistinct)

618
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,023
- Um, Knowledge.

619
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,903
- Mm-hm.

620
00:55:11,903 --> 00:55:13,893
- When you get out of jail,

621
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,570
can you come live here?

622
00:55:22,658 --> 00:55:23,908
- I don't know.

623
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,590
- Hey, what are those?

624
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,553
- Nothing.
- Were you in my room?

625
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,693
- No.

626
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:33,527
- Hand them over.

627
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,315
- They're not yours anyway.

628
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:46,313
- Wh-what are those of?

629
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:47,490
- Nothing.

630
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:49,040
It's just a friend. That's all.

631
00:55:52,355 --> 00:55:57,355
- Who's the little boy?

632
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:01,997
- Um, excuse me, all right.

633
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,290
- Sally?

634
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,123
- Yeah?

635
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:15,983
- I may be having to go
away for a little while,

636
00:56:15,983 --> 00:56:17,093
on a trip.

637
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:23,243
And I don't want you
to tell daddy about it.

638
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:28,918
But um, I promise I'm going to be back,

639
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:29,752
soon.

640
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:33,698
- Are you going with Knowledge?

641
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,443
- Maybe?

642
00:56:41,873 --> 00:56:43,588
Is that okay about dad?

643
00:56:45,922 --> 00:56:46,755
- Yeah.

644
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,663
(rap music)

645
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,715
- Yo man, you're bugging dude.

646
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:16,700
- Yo man, come on.

647
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,800
Don't be such a Herb shit, you know?

648
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,015
Come on yo, you gotta loosen yourself up.

649
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:23,585
- Who you calling a Herb?

650
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:24,418
Huh, oh.

651
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:26,980
Oh, oh I'm black so I'm
supposed to be able to know how

652
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,813
to dance right?

653
00:57:27,813 --> 00:57:29,003
- Hell yeah.

654
00:57:29,003 --> 00:57:30,590
- Look, I know how to dance, aight.

655
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,663
I just, you know.

656
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:33,593
I ain't doin' it in front
of people, that's all.

657
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:35,470
- Come on, move your damn feet.

658
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,330
This shit is supposed to
be part of your culture.

659
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,958
You know that-
- Fuck off.

660
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,115
What the fuck you know about my culture?

661
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:42,125
- Wow, all right.

662
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,375
(laughing)

663
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,533
- All right, aight, aight.

664
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:49,367
Oh shit.

665
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,190
- You pushed me man.

666
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,023
I feel stupid.

667
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:54,430
- Well you look stupid.

668
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,560
Now move man.

669
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,803
Come on, aight.

670
00:57:56,803 --> 00:57:58,585
Yeah, aight, aight.

671
00:57:58,585 --> 00:57:59,418
Now the arms.

672
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:01,495
Now the arms, all right.

673
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:04,670
Yeah. Hahaha.

674
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:08,210
All right, here you go.

675
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,103
Boom.
- Boom.

676
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:13,353
(laughing)

677
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,883
- Got a girlfriend or something?

678
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,103
- No.

679
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:33,163
- Find that hard to believe.

680
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,963
- Yeah who, who is this guys again?

681
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,378
- Why you sweatin' me man?

682
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:49,832
His name is Tyrone.

683
00:58:49,832 --> 00:58:50,998
Just a friend.

684
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,290
- Friend.

685
00:58:56,257 --> 00:58:57,507
- I found this,

686
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,990
this tape in your living room.

687
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,797
- Yo this must have been my ma's.

688
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:21,785
(slow jazz music)

689
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,363
- I think that's Ron Carter on the bass.

690
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:53,783
- Wow.

691
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:09,972
- What?

692
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,400
- Nothing.

693
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:22,988
- It's beautiful.

694
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:07,122
When I was ugh,

695
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,630
13 there was this kid

696
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,210
who disappeared in the woods up here.

697
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,973
Wandered away from his family's camp.

698
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,778
No one could find him.

699
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:32,573
They tried for weeks.

700
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:36,703
Helicopters.

701
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,633
Infrared detectors.

702
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,063
Dogs.

703
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,913
You name it, they used it.

704
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,415
But they still couldn't find this kid.

705
01:01:56,252 --> 01:01:57,585
And it was like,

706
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,550
all of a sudden this
place that people thought

707
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,058
was so beautiful,

708
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:11,860
turned into this monster
that could swallow you up.

709
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:21,150
And then, couple weeks later

710
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:28,070
my dad caught me foolin'
around with some friends.

711
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,510
This guy Marty

712
01:02:37,722 --> 01:02:39,722
and this other guy Kyle.

713
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:43,680
He said it was real bad.

714
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,560
He said that if I was
ever bad like that again

715
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,980
something like what happened to that kid

716
01:02:55,783 --> 01:02:57,063
c-could happen to me.

717
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,383
- Yeah.

718
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,410
Yeah.

719
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,333
In my hood right,

720
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,928
if you're black and you're a fag

721
01:03:31,903 --> 01:03:32,803
you're just a fag.

722
01:03:38,307 --> 01:03:41,103
I met Tyrone in high school.

723
01:03:42,878 --> 01:03:44,212
A few years ago.

724
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,338
He used to intimidate everybody man.

725
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:52,598
Except me.

726
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:04,078
We swore, you know, that
we'd never tell nobody.

727
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,128
Because we were just scared, you know?

728
01:04:15,343 --> 01:04:16,763
They got these um,

729
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,620
they got these counselors

730
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,683
over at Black Brook.

731
01:04:25,338 --> 01:04:27,250
They just,

732
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,463
they just want to know
everything about you, you know?

733
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,173
They want to know who you are

734
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:35,090
and who you were and...

735
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,743
They just want to break
a nigger, you know?

736
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,383
And I didn't give them nothin'.

737
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,530
I'm not giving my shit to nobody.

738
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,703
I'm going to go back to the cabin.

739
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:02,245
- No, no.

740
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:03,078
No.

741
01:05:05,855 --> 01:05:07,943
You can sleep here.

742
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:09,525
You know it's just,

743
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:15,915
I'm not really used to it.

744
01:05:16,905 --> 01:05:18,255
- What about your pops man?

745
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,850
- Nah, he won't

746
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,340
he won't come in here.

747
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,398
He hates it in here.

748
01:05:48,338 --> 01:05:49,422
- Night Seth.

749
01:06:21,263 --> 01:06:23,513
(knocking)

750
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,463
- Doris.

751
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:39,250
Kristen are you okay?

752
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,653
Sweetheart, what is it?

753
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:46,398
(phone ringing)

754
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,303
- Pop.

755
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,613
Sally?

756
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:07,483
Hello?

757
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:10,703
Hello.

758
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,710
- How many more cases do we need?

759
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:32,660
- Two oughta do it.

760
01:07:37,065 --> 01:07:38,960
Carlson's Gun Shop.

761
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,793
Oh hey Sid.

762
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,320
She did?

763
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,153
Good.

764
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:44,893
Yeah.

765
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,273
Yeah.

766
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,053
Jesus.

767
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,633
Uh no I-

768
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,140
No, Sally didn't say anything.

769
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:06,100
Yeah, he should be there.

770
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,925
Yeah, I know he overslept.

771
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:15,593
I'll be right there, thanks.

772
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:54,250
(register dinging)

773
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:04,107
- What are you doing?

774
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:05,238
- What?

775
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:06,470
- I mean with the money idiot.

776
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:09,110
What are you doing with
all the fucking money?

777
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,780
- He's paying the bakery guy out back.

778
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,430
That fucking okay with you Marty?

779
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,880
- Yeah.

780
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,713
Sure.

781
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,590
Sheriff was by looking for you.

782
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,773
- I'll keep Sid here as long as I can.

783
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,453
It needs gas.

784
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,210
- All right, we gotta go.

785
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,298
Now.

786
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:55,132
- What's wrong?

787
01:09:55,132 --> 01:09:57,198
- They found out about you man.

788
01:09:57,198 --> 01:09:58,143
- Fuck.

789
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,477
- All right, aight aight aight.

790
01:09:59,477 --> 01:10:03,400
Ugh, it's going to take about
two days to get to Canada.

791
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,520
We're going to have to
go through the mountains.

792
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,313
Look I know the trails,
man we can do this.

793
01:10:06,313 --> 01:10:08,210
Come on.
- You want to try for Canada?

794
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,760
- Look we don't have any time, aight.

795
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,970
I'm gonna throw this shit in the car.

796
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,043
- Hey Seth.

797
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,050
- Hey Sid, what's up?

798
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:34,298
- Wanna tell me what's going on?

799
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,310
- I borrowed Francine's car.

800
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:41,260
We're having trouble with the
water pump in the back again.

801
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,733
- Pump again.

802
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,573
- Yeah.

803
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,375
- Where is he Seth?

804
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:51,090
- Who, where's who?

805
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,950
- The kid who escaped Black Brook.

806
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,650
I know he's here, Kristen told me.

807
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,420
- You have a warrant?

808
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,663
- You've been watching
too much television.

809
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,530
Your father said I could come in.

810
01:11:09,293 --> 01:11:11,320
- He took off this morning.

811
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,783
- Well then you won't mind
if I take a look around.

812
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,388
- I'm sorry.
- Seth.

813
01:11:16,388 --> 01:11:18,638
- I can't do that, no.
- What do you mean you can't?

814
01:11:18,638 --> 01:11:19,470
What's going on?

815
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,703
- Please, just leave.

816
01:11:23,105 --> 01:11:24,105
- Knowledge Johnson,

817
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,875
wanna turn around and put
your hands behind your head.

818
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,260
(loads gun)

819
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,380
Jesus Christ.

820
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,410
- Damn Seth.

821
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,220
- Now, leave.

822
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,890
- Seth, put that thing down.

823
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,900
- Look I don't want to hurt you all right.

824
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:40,360
So just take your gun out
and throw it over there.

825
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,640
- Look I already called the state police-

826
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,013
- Do what I say.
- Your father's-

827
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,910
I'm not going to throw down my gun.

828
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,247
You know how long I've known this boy?

829
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,683
I watched you grow up.

830
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:55,440
I watched you nurse your sick mother.

831
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,830
What are you doing?

832
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,690
Come on, give me the gun.

833
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:05,490
Come on-
(gun shot)

834
01:12:19,887 --> 01:12:20,720
- My god.

835
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,793
What are you fucking stupid?

836
01:12:48,525 --> 01:12:51,275
- Yo make a left up at that barn.

837
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,720
Yo, turn here.

838
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,553
- Where?

839
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:06,430
- Here man.

840
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:09,180
- Where? Where?
- Here, turn here.

841
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:54,480
- This is not happening to me.

842
01:14:57,508 --> 01:14:58,340
Ah!

843
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:02,117
What do you want to do now, huh man?

844
01:15:02,117 --> 01:15:02,950
Hmm?

845
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,790
- All right, wait.

846
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:07,020
We can,

847
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,820
we can push the car off
the side of the road

848
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,053
and the trail head's not far so.

849
01:15:16,108 --> 01:15:18,608
- All right fine, let's do it.

850
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,633
- Oh.

851
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,585
- What was that little boys name?

852
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:43,418
- Malik.

853
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:47,368
Mean's king.

854
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,033
He would have loved it up here man.

855
01:16:57,683 --> 01:16:58,733
- He's dead isn't he?

856
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,418
It's faster down than up man.

857
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,090
- All right man, I'm down.

858
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,093
Throw the shit down.

859
01:18:01,068 --> 01:18:02,068
- All right.

860
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:14,497
- Yo, be careful man.

861
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:15,920
- Yo man, I'm not from Brooklyn.

862
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,020
I know what a tree is.

863
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,415
Knowledge.

864
01:18:23,415 --> 01:18:24,248
Ah.

865
01:18:25,085 --> 01:18:26,102
- Seth!

866
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:26,935
- OW.

867
01:18:28,515 --> 01:18:31,747
(indistinct)

868
01:18:31,747 --> 01:18:33,248
- Is it this?

869
01:18:33,248 --> 01:18:34,350
Okay.

870
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,363
Don't move, just stay there a second.

871
01:18:43,148 --> 01:18:44,297
All right.

872
01:18:44,297 --> 01:18:45,130
Hold on.

873
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:50,613
All right, come on.

874
01:18:50,613 --> 01:18:51,602
- All right, wait.
- Use that leg.

875
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,102
- Wait, all right.

876
01:18:54,112 --> 01:18:54,973
- I got you.

877
01:18:54,973 --> 01:18:55,807
I got you kid.

878
01:18:55,807 --> 01:18:56,700
- All right, all right.
- I got you.

879
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,533
Put your arm on me.

880
01:18:57,533 --> 01:18:58,367
There you go.

881
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,200
- Okay.

882
01:19:24,317 --> 01:19:25,757
- Shoot.

883
01:19:25,757 --> 01:19:27,477
You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.

884
01:19:27,477 --> 01:19:28,310
I got it.

885
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:33,468
- Shit.

886
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:55,150
- Who's the man.

887
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,550
Who's the fucking man, huh?

888
01:19:59,130 --> 01:19:59,963
All right.

889
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,435
Just rest.

890
01:20:03,435 --> 01:20:04,268
Just heal it up.

891
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,568
You're all right.

892
01:20:11,025 --> 01:20:11,858
It's over.

893
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,723
- I had a dream you got killed.

894
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,360
Someone had a gun and you got in the way.

895
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:03,035
- How you feelin'?

896
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:05,743
- Cold.

897
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,848
- You don't know what it was
like in my neighborhood man.

898
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,578
I hated myself so much.

899
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,700
Tyrone told me I should get a gun,

900
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,540
to protect me and mine's you know?

901
01:22:04,013 --> 01:22:06,347
When I came home that night,

902
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,063
cops were already there.

903
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,600
They were like waiting for me.

904
01:22:18,503 --> 01:22:22,920
And they had this little
white sheet draped over him.

905
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:29,975
Blood just, just came through.

906
01:22:40,165 --> 01:22:40,998
Malik,

907
01:22:43,308 --> 01:22:44,475
he was my son.

908
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,925
Malik, he was my little boy.

909
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:42,955
- I killed someone.

910
01:24:44,758 --> 01:24:45,592
- It was an accident.

911
01:24:45,592 --> 01:24:46,938
- No it doesn't matter man.

912
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:47,770
- Sh.

913
01:25:12,558 --> 01:25:14,243
- You see those two peaks?

914
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,133
- Yeah.

915
01:25:17,493 --> 01:25:18,630
- That's the border man.

916
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:20,213
- Come on let's go.

917
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:40,897
(dogs barking)

918
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:48,505
- Hold it.

919
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:54,143
You release my boy now.

920
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,183
- Dad.

921
