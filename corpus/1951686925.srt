1
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:56,016
Who are you?

2
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,824
Jesus.

3
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,725
You ok?

4
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,725
Do I look ok?

5
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:46,026
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist

6
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,676
No...

7
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:03,577
Trevor...

8
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,227
You still got half an hour.

9
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,027
I can fix you some eggs.

10
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,578
I am tired but thanks.

11
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:04,133
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

12
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,483
Come on guys, keep it moving.

13
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,734
Yes sir, yes sir,
Master Tucker, motherfucker

14
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,734
Hey, why is that machine down!

15
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:22,535
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill

16
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,735
Where am I going to make up
that 7 minutes? Miller?

17
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,235
Your paycheck?

18
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:31,435
-Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations.
-What regulations?

19
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,936
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning
and maintenance of all heavy machineries, (motion 1989)

20
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:43,737
Ya! Write to your congressman and hurry that up.

21
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:53,987
Congratulations, Reznik.
You just made my shitlist.

22
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:03,603
And he's like, you know, babe this babe that...
Chatting like mother fucking Barry White.

23
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,903
Talking about what he is going to do to her,
and how to make her Cucci feel and all that.

24
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,298
That is right.

25
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:09,439
So then, she stopped

26
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:13,339
She looked back at him with these
big puppy eyes she's like...

27
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,704
That sounds good puppy,
but me no have no Cucci

28
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,740
So, my man said, what?!
He looked down and realised that SHE IS A HE!

29
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,140
Man, that's bullshit!

30
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,700
You meant to tell me that this whore was wearing nothing
but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference.

31
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,040
Hey, man. he had one of those "tuck jobs".
Come on Jones, you know how to do that.

32
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,091
You might, I don't!

33
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,371
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:38,727
You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?

35
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:39,906
Can't, got plans.

36
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:44,942
Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night.
Hey, what is up with you?  you used to be alright.

37
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,392
Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright.

38
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:51,842
Hey, Jackson, you need to realise that
some men prefer the company of women.

39
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:56,043
Who!  hotty duty, he ain't get no booty.

40
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,973
Maybe he has got a date by the name "tuck jobs"

41
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:03,569
No, your mother said she couldn't make it.

42
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:08,144
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

43
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,146
You ok?

44
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,946
Do I look ok?

45
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,497
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

46
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:39,847
What's wrong?

47
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,597
I don't know, deja vu.

48
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,197
You are tired, you need to sleep.

49
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,099
How do you do it?

50
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:01,849
What?

51
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,599
Sleep so little and still look so good.

52
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,550
Are you flirting with me?

53
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,399
Commiserating

54
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,850
-Try to fatten me up?
-What if I am?

55
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,650
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

56
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,750
You had that last night.

57
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,100
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

58
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,651
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm

59
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:28,101
What else do you know about me?

60
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,051
That you are lonely.

61
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:37,402
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

62
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:43,653
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:48,953
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

64
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:49,653
Check please

65
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:07,766
You, Reznik, Furman's office. Now!

66
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,967
How are you doing, Reznik?

67
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:15,967
What is this about?

68
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,366
Frankly I am concerned about you.

69
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,767
To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit.

70
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:29,117
I felt a lot on my mind lately.

71
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:32,568
-Anything we can help with?
-No, thanks. There's nothing I can't handle.

72
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,669
- Wanna see a doctor?
- It is not necessary, I am fine really.

73
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,518
Are you doing drugs Reznik?

74
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,619
Where is Stewart?

75
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,169
He couldn't make it

76
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,769
- Shouldn't even be in here with an union ()
- See what I mean.

77
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,770
Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, but believe me,
there is absolutely nothing to worry about

78
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,470
Then I will just get back to work

79
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,870
Er... Trevor, not yet.

80
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,971
I need to ask you for a UA

81
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:14,728
Look like rain.

82
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,278
Radio says there is a storm on the way.

83
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,179
they said right.

84
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,879
I'd say it's already here.

85
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,980
You are on the first shift?

86
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,780
- Yeah
- Me too

87
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,631
Funny I never seen you before.

88
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,781
I've been here.

89
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:57,631
I work in the pit
I just picked up Reynolds's shift.

90
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,731
Where is Reynolds?

91
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:04,382
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.

92
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:12,933
I am Ivan.

93
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:19,733
Trevor

94
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:28,484
Well, I guess I'd better begin by...

95
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:31,285
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.

96
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:33,084
You got that right.

97
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:35,884
I will see you around.

98
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:04,438
what is wrong?

99
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:07,488
I just want to lie here.

100
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:09,688
We can do that.

101
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,789
I'm... so... tired

102
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,089
You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter.

103
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,539
That is the problem. I can't sleep.

104
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:24,789
Nothing helps.

105
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,090
Don't worry about it honey.

106
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,690
Everyone get insomnia every now and then.

107
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,790
Stevie

108
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,991
I haven't slept in a year.

109
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:51,092
Jesus Christ!

110
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,492
I tried him too...

111
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,392
I am sorry.

112
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:05,493
Hello?

113
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:12,444
Yeah. No I can't.
I can't talk now. Okay.

114
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:20,795
My ex, he's a fucking Psycho.

115
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:25,894
Trevor, I am worried about you.

116
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:30,995
Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia.

117
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:36,895
I hope not, you are my best client.
Can't afford to lose ya.

118
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:39,897
Geee... thanks

119
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,996
Reznik, I need a hand

120
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:56,398
Gotta get this dead level here, help me out

121
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:00,398
- Safety on?
- Oh Yeah

122
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:07,499
How is that?

123
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:08,799
A little to the left.

124
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,150
Do I need more?

125
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,750
Hey, you sleep on your own time, need some help here.

126
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,800
Better, now try the other side.

127
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:31,750
I hate this bitch.

128
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,403
Hey! what did you do?

129
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,104
I am hooked up here.
Kill it, will ya?

130
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:04,603
-Come on, kill it.
-Not working.

131
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,454
Damn it! Reznik!
Shit!

132
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:08,204
- Kill it!
- Not working

133
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:13,004
God! Jesus!

134
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:15,454
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

135
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,155
Hit the breaker!

136
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:27,456
Hey, hey, hey!
We some help over here!

137
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:29,406
We need some help

138
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:35,207
- Come on man, come on.
- What's happening here, man?

139
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,207
Call an ambulance!

140
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:40,708
What happened here?

141
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,007
I was helping him with the belt.
I thought the safety was on.

142
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:44,008
You thought?!

143
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:48,108
Somebody kill that fucking machine!

144
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:56,014
Shit!

145
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,466
Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I come to give you the rent.

146
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:33,017
And so early. Oh Mr Reznik, I only wish
all my tenants are considerate as you.

147
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:34,717
I will give you a receipt in the morning

148
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:37,218
Good night mr. Reznik.

149
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:40,168
Err... Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me

150
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:44,118
but... if you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

151
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,819
- Has there been a burglary?
- No, no, no, I just wondered if...

152
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,019
You know errr... if you noticed anything unusual lately?

153
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,720
Unusual?

154
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:00,019
Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

155
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:04,570
I am sorry... to disturb you so late.
Good night.

156
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,821
What we know is this:

157
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:18,321
One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.

158
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,922
Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone
of mill while it was off.

159
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,972
Three: the mill suddenly activates,

160
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:31,123
catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this.

161
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:42,724
What is the fucking point?

162
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,774
These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

163
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:49,174
Our job is to investigate these events
from every possible angles...

164
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,624
So that we might prevent their reoccurrence.

165
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:56,725
So we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co-operative.

166
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:01,025
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.

167
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:03,325
What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?

168
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:05,676
I was distracted.

169
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:09,026
By what?
What distracted you?

170
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:19,227
It was Ivan,
I was watching Ivan on the pit.

171
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:21,877
The whole thing is my fault, okay.

172
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,277
Who did you say?

173
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,278
The new arcwelder,
I don't know his last name.

174
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:30,628
- What new arcwelder?
- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift.

175
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:33,978
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
This guy got his place.

176
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:36,078
What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?

177
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:39,478
Reynolds is right over there
on the pit as usual, busting his ass.

178
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:44,229
There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik.

179
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:03,831
What is this?

180
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,932
Mr. Reznik
Have you recently suffered any head injuries?

181
00:25:13,238 --> 00:25:15,387
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

182
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:16,738
No

183
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:19,488
-Trevor
-Yeah

184
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:21,788
Can I ask you a question?
Sure

185
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,738
Why do you go all of your way
to come here every night?

186
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,739
Is it all the way?

187
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:31,139
An airport? For coffee and pie?

188
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:33,839
Suppose I went to Danni's...

189
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,289
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.

190
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,889
Could I do that just in any diner?

191
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,141
Is someone chasing you?

192
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,490
Not yet. But they will
when they find out who I am.

193
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,690
Oh really!  Who are you?

194
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,991
Can you keep a secret?

195
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,791
To the grave.

196
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,642
I am Elvis Presley.

197
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,991
I ran away from home
to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.

198
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:04,492
I thought you looked familiar.

199
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:14,843
Got plans for mother's day?

200
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:17,843
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.

201
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,193
Suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun.

202
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:23,544
That is ok, when he is older

203
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:25,394
I will let him make it up to me.

204
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:27,894
A little guilt goes a long way.

205
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:29,294
How about you?

206
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:30,945
Cemetery

207
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:35,044
- Oh, I am sorry
- Thanks

208
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:39,245
I lost mine too. Still hurts.

209
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:42,995
I am not so good at losing family.

210
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:43,946
Who is?

211
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,546
What's weird is that it did not hit
until I picked out her burial dress.

212
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,996
I pictured her while buying it...

213
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:57,797
...Not knowing it would...

214
00:26:57,897 --> 00:26:59,747
You know, be the one.

215
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,047
Seems unfair, isn't it?

216
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:06,948
Not knowing things like that

217
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:14,948
Hey, how about spending the day
with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?

218
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,649
Sounds dreamy

219
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:58,153
Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?

220
00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:00,353
Armed robbery.

221
00:28:00,753 --> 00:28:04,103
Oh yeah, that is right, because I and Jackson
had you packed and pantified... ain't that right, Jackson?

222
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:08,153
HEY, I don't see what is so fucking funny.

223
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:13,254
You clowns think this's fucking like some big joke
but it ain't!

224
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:18,954
Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you.

225
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:21,154
You made me nervous.

226
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:26,155
You look like shit, acting all crazy.
What is up with you?

227
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:27,856
Nothing is up with me.

228
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:31,456
It was an accident and I am the one
who gotta live with it, not you.

229
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:36,856
You ain't hearing me, man.

230
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:41,607
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.

231
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:02,758
See you tomorrow.

232
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,210
Hey

233
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:53,013
Howdy, partner.

234
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:56,063
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

235
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:59,064
- What about?
- I don't know, but it seemed important.

236
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:03,264
What! He's ganna have to wait,
it is Miller time.

237
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:07,964
We need to talk.

238
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:11,564
Follow me.

239
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,015
Come on!

240
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,366
Another Bourbon.

241
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:42,718
Make it double.

242
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:54,419
You shooting coke or something?

243
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:59,819
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.

244
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:03,289
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.

245
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:04,870
How about abnormally?

246
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,270
I see Reynolds is back to work.

247
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,870
Gets to me bail

248
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,071
I will tell you one thing,
If I dig, You are showing carbon to it.

249
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:22,471
Would you? never trust a con, cowboy!

250
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:24,271
They ain't get to live to be honest.

251
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:28,071
Where they hiding you these days?

252
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:30,772
Around

253
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:37,723
Hey, you wanna see something?

254
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:45,814
Look at that. Lost them on a lake.

255
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:50,974
They took a big toe from the left foot
and a finger from my right.

256
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:53,473
That is why I walk with a gimp.

257
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:59,475
Yeah, I can't shuffle my cock like I used to
but the ladies sure like it.

258
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:06,275
Oh, no. You look like you have seen a ghost.

259
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:12,075
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.

260
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:17,276
- That is why I can't get a raise.
- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll.

261
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:18,976
You believe that?

262
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:23,276
- Why would they lie?
- They just have a little bit of fun with you.

263
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:25,627
I am not laughing.

264
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:33,278
Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm.
He could have died.

265
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:36,828
That ain't my problem.

266
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,279
You caused the accident, not me.

267
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,129
Where are you going?

268
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:55,979
Take a leak, you wanna watch?

269
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,780
I will be right back, don't just bail me now.

270
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:43,884
- Hello?
- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor.

271
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,734
What time is it?

272
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:49,985
How are they biting Reynolds?

273
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:59,185
- You, you are drunk, Reznik.
- The game's over. I got proof on you.

274
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:02,035
I could use it.

275
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:06,836
You better watch your fucking ass buddy,
before you lose it.

276
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,142
Trevor?

277
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,541
I need to see you, Stevie.

278
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:15,077
- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here.
- Please, Stevie.

279
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:18,842
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?

280
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,863
No, no, no, no, I need to see you now.

281
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:25,793
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

282
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:30,894
Ok, give me a minute.

283
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:37,194
I appreciate you making time for me,
you are the only one I can talk to.

284
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:41,044
My pleasure.

285
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:45,675
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.

286
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:52,545
Something is happening to me, Stevie.

287
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:56,796
Some kind of... plot.

288
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:03,597
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.

289
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:06,747
- Oh, my god!
- Now the guys at work are against me.

290
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:11,898
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...

291
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:15,998
Their eyes, their little games.

292
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:20,998
What?

293
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,849
E R.. E R..

294
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:30,399
-T U C K E R
-Trevor?

295
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,299
TUCKER?

296
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:37,800
Maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard.

297
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:38,799
I mean...

298
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,801
If they wanted you out,
they could just fire you.

299
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,401
I am not worried about being fired.

300
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:51,101
Then what are you worried about?

301
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:55,351
I don't know yet.

302
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:09,252
There you go, made to order.

303
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,902
- Thanks.
- Surprise!

304
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:16,753
Got ya! That one's going on the fridge.

305
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:19,223
Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas.

306
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:22,454
By the carousel.

307
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:25,304
Just a minute.

308
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:30,804
Okay, ready.

309
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,155
Smile!

310
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,056
It helps if you push the button.

311
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:50,306
Trevor? What is it?

312
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:02,108
- This place, brings back memories.
- Good memories I hope.

313
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:05,358
Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid.

314
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:12,809
My ex, probably phone
to ruin a happy Mother's Day

315
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,259
Could you...?

316
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:20,409
- Yes, no sweat. I will take Nicolas for a ride.
- Thanks.

317
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,610
How long have you known my mother?

318
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,660
About a year.

319
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,460
How did you meet her?

320
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:36,460
We just kind of met.

321
00:38:38,311 --> 00:38:40,361
Are you going to see her again?

322
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:41,661
I hope so.

323
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:44,411
Would you like that?

324
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:45,562
I guess so

325
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:51,162
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

326
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:52,562
What?

327
00:38:53,212 --> 00:38:57,313
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?

328
00:38:57,463 --> 00:39:00,213
Made me realised what a wonderful mother I had.

329
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:03,813
You will realise that too some day.

330
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:05,114
What is that?

331
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,263
Monster ride.

332
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:11,064
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What does that mean?

333
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:15,915
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

334
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:17,314
Can we go in?

335
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:21,114
Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother.

336
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:22,315
What for?

337
00:39:22,515 --> 00:39:26,315
You are going straight
to hell on route 666.

338
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:34,016
Ride here if you dare!
You are going straight to hell on route 666.

339
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,516
Look like someone had a bad crack up.

340
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:43,217
Fill her up, cowboy.

341
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:53,567
We wouldn't be eating in there
anytime soon, Nicolas?

342
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:10,219
Eww.. look at that.

343
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,320
You should close your eyes.

344
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:28,821
Jesus!

345
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:38,021
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

346
00:40:42,422 --> 00:40:43,773
Shady Lady

347
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:48,782
Oh, my God.

348
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,223
Stop!

349
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:52,323
Woo

350
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,225
Take a right, Nicolas!
Right, a right!

351
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:44,228
Nicolas, Nicolas!
Hey, Nicolas!

352
00:41:58,529 --> 00:41:59,979
I need some help here.

353
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:03,780
Okay, somebody gets a doctor.

354
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,130
Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help.

355
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,180
Nicolas!

356
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,331
I swear to God, I don't know what happened.

357
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:19,630
He is epileptic.
I should have told you.

358
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,831
- I will call an ambulance.
- No, thanks.

359
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:26,532
It is ok, baby.

360
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:43,333
It hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.

361
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,133
I could have killed myself
for taking him on that ride.

362
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,934
It's ok, it's not your fault.

363
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,934
He won't even remember it,
as if nothing ever happened.

364
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,935
Wanna come in?

365
00:43:03,935 --> 00:43:05,435
I think you could use a drink.

366
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,239
I hope wine is okay with you.

367
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,839
That'll work.

368
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,340
What good is it at home
if you can't relax in it.

369
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,841
I will have to remember that.

370
00:44:15,942 --> 00:44:18,192
Trevor? Can I ask you something?

371
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,392
Should my lawyer be present?

372
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:28,642
Why are you always leaving such generous tips?

373
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:32,028
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?

374
00:44:32,093 --> 00:44:33,843
And entertainment.

375
00:44:35,243 --> 00:44:36,994
- Entertainment?
- You.

376
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,393
Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship.

377
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:46,794
Sorry, I wasn't meant that way.

378
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:52,845
If you really wanna spoil me,
take me to a movie sometime.

379
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:54,145
Hmmm?

380
00:44:56,045 --> 00:44:56,945
That is a deal.

381
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:05,446
My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass.

382
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:08,646
I will get it.

383
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:11,896
-You wait on me.
-Thanks

384
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,648
It is the last door on the left.

385
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:46,516
Reznik

386
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:51,466
I want you on the Swansea-leave today.

387
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:56,967
- Where is Sanchez?
- That is an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you.

388
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:12,799
Shit!

389
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:32,070
- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you, Mr Furman.

390
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,270
Bye. See you now.

391
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,890
Hey, look who it is.
Bombay Miller, you ok?

392
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:41,722
- Good, good.
- You be easy now.

393
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:42,951
Yeah, man, take it easy.

394
00:49:44,772 --> 00:49:48,172
My God, Miller.
I don't know where to begin.

395
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:52,072
Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
There is nothing to say.

396
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:54,872
I wish there is someway I can repay you.

397
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:01,073
Well, for a start, you can give me your left arm.

398
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:04,004
In fact, that is why I came
by here today. Isn't it, Tucker?

399
00:50:04,094 --> 00:50:05,273
Fair is fair

400
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:09,374
We are just razzing you, kid

401
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,424
You keep your left arm,
I will keep my settlement.

402
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:16,474
Hell! How can a guy lost an arm
end up like getting a deal like this?

403
00:50:16,474 --> 00:50:18,075
So, I guess you can call me lucky.

404
00:50:18,275 --> 00:50:21,825
Well, Miller,
if there is anything I can do...

405
00:50:23,675 --> 00:50:27,475
Nah, forget it.
No hard feelings, huh.

406
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,525
I will see you around, pal.

407
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:06,179
Ah!

408
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:07,979
Hey!

409
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:10,080
Help!

410
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,930
Hey!

411
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,230
Hey!

412
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,080
Someone help me!
Someone help me!

413
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:38,032
Reznik

414
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,082
Ah...

415
00:51:39,082 --> 00:51:40,032
I got ya, I got ya.

416
00:51:40,182 --> 00:51:41,982
Be cool, be cool, alright?

417
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:49,083
Who did it, huh?

418
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:51,083
Why did you turn the fucking braker!

419
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,083
Was it all of you?

420
00:51:54,084 --> 00:51:55,283
Was it you, Jones?

421
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,134
Was it you? Was it you?

422
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,383
Or was it you?

423
00:51:58,633 --> 00:52:00,334
You sick bastard,
you're imagining things again!

424
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,434
Oh yeah? You've been fishing
with Ivan lately, Reynolds?

425
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:08,485
How's that... How's that tuna biting?
Let's see how you talk yourself out of this one!

426
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:17,985
Where is it?

427
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:20,135
Right, what the fuck now, Reznik!

428
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:24,686
Get him off me!

429
00:52:27,586 --> 00:52:29,287
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.

430
00:52:29,587 --> 00:52:30,637
You are fired.

431
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:40,738
This motherfucker's crazy.

432
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:42,587
You lost it, man.

433
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:03,740
Shit!

434
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,591
Damn it! Where is it?

435
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:23,441
Asshole!

436
00:53:24,892 --> 00:53:26,741
What the fuck did you do with it?

437
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:30,192
Idiot!

438
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,950
Hey! Fuck you!

439
00:54:58,450 --> 00:54:59,350
Get out!

440
00:55:15,402 --> 00:55:16,301
What?

441
00:55:19,301 --> 00:55:20,852
It's an occupational hazard.

442
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:43,854
So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from
this miserable life or what?

443
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:52,905
I could give it up for the right guy.

444
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,956
Oh, that came out wrong.

445
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:05,406
What I mean is...

446
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:13,007
I would, you know,
stop hooking if you wanted me to.

447
00:56:15,607 --> 00:56:17,658
I mean, there are lots of
pancakes out there, right?

448
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:26,408
I think I'd like that.

449
00:57:46,615 --> 00:57:47,766
Mr. Reznik.

450
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:50,345
I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else.

451
00:57:50,365 --> 00:57:51,916
You leave me in such a scare.

452
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,566
What are you doing in my apartment?

453
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,117
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

454
00:58:00,317 --> 00:58:01,717
That's impossible.

455
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:03,517
I'm gonna leave a note.

456
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:05,917
A note? What kind of note?

457
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:07,767
About the leak.

458
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,918
What's that terrible smell?

459
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:12,868
There is no leak in this apartment.

460
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:15,017
Now if you would excuse me...

461
00:58:15,017 --> 00:58:15,718
You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?

462
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:19,518
Yeah, I'm sure. If you need anything,
please call first.

463
00:59:42,426 --> 00:59:43,426
Miller!

464
00:59:44,826 --> 00:59:45,927
Hey, Reznik.

465
00:59:46,826 --> 00:59:48,426
It's a pleasant surprise.

466
00:59:49,227 --> 00:59:50,426
We need to talk.

467
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:52,577
Take a look at this, huh?

468
00:59:52,827 --> 00:59:54,527
Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line.

469
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:58,127
Let's not trim anyting for a while.

470
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,127
I need to be doing something.

471
00:59:59,127 --> 01:00:01,128
Can't just watch the soap opera all day.

472
01:00:01,128 --> 01:00:05,628
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't. Listen to the doctor.

473
01:00:05,628 --> 01:00:09,528
Margie, this is Reznik.
The man who cost me my arm.

474
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:14,809
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

475
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,859
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

476
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,430
Is there some place we can talk?

477
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:31,630
Check it out.
It's a beauty.

478
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:34,630
8 cylinders

479
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:38,731
Speed sensitive steering

480
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:42,231
ABS breaking with road texure and tension

481
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:47,132
Defence lock-up helps you
maintain control in emergencies.

482
01:00:47,132 --> 01:00:48,632
Of course, it's automatic.

483
01:00:48,932 --> 01:00:49,832
Hell I wanted a stick...

484
01:00:49,832 --> 01:00:53,132
but I figured my shifting ability
wouldn't be so hot.

485
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:57,633
You know I am not at
National any more, right?

486
01:00:57,883 --> 01:00:59,033
Yeah, I heard about it.

487
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,183
It sounds like you almost
lost one yourself, huh?

488
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:04,433
Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?

489
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:05,834
Ironic?

490
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,884
I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade.

491
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:11,434
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

492
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:14,135
Moments after you left the shop,

493
01:01:14,135 --> 01:01:16,034
someone powered up my machine.

494
01:01:17,035 --> 01:01:17,885
With my arm in it.

495
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:19,685
I nearly got killed.

496
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:21,035
Accidents happen.

497
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:22,035
It wasn't an accident.

498
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:25,735
Accidents happen out of negligence

499
01:01:26,735 --> 01:01:28,636
This happened down the spike.

500
01:01:28,636 --> 01:01:30,236
That's some vocabulary you got kid.

501
01:01:30,236 --> 01:01:31,136
Spike.

502
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:34,936
It wields vengeance,
vengeance means revenge Miller.

503
01:01:34,936 --> 01:01:36,636
I am sure you know
what revenge means, don't you?

504
01:01:36,636 --> 01:01:37,936
I am onto you Miller.

505
01:01:37,936 --> 01:01:41,137
Despite your stupid jokes,
you secretly balme me for the accident.

506
01:01:41,137 --> 01:01:43,736
New car, huh? You despise me for it.

507
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:45,037
How did you get into my place?

508
01:01:45,037 --> 01:01:46,638
Duplicate keys? credit card? What?

509
01:01:46,638 --> 01:01:48,537
Fuck you, Miller!

510
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:49,738
This shit is gonna stop!

511
01:01:58,538 --> 01:02:00,439
Get off my property, punk!

512
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,641
Bastards.

513
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:37,642
Shit.

514
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:53,194
Come on.

515
01:03:31,147 --> 01:03:32,547
7-4...

516
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:34,147
...3-C-R

517
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:35,647
It's 743CR.

518
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:45,148
What?

519
01:03:48,848 --> 01:03:49,598
Shit.

520
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:00,249
Fuck!

521
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:05,050
I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide...

522
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,650
...motor's information to the general public.

523
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,950
I'm not just a memeber of the general public.

524
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,650
This guy is a friend of mine.

525
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:13,651
But you don't know your firend's address?

526
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:15,451
We just met, I don't know him that well.

527
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:19,151
Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service.

528
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:20,952
I just want talk to him.

529
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:24,752
I'm sorry sir, I can't help you
unless a crime has been committed.

530
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:25,752
Has a crime been committed?

531
01:04:26,352 --> 01:04:31,052
Please, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremly important.

532
01:04:31,052 --> 01:04:33,052
Sorry sir. No crime, no information.

533
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:42,454
What if I told you I was hit by this car?

534
01:04:44,253 --> 01:04:45,754
I don't see any bruises.

535
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:47,553
If you did,
would you give me an address?

536
01:04:48,654 --> 01:04:50,254
No, but the police might.

537
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:32,364
I want to report a hit and run.

538
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:45,815
Bring it back when you are finished.
Fill it out over there.

539
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:25,768
Mr. Reznik.

540
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,769
You sure about these plate numbers?

541
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:33,469
743CR. All right, that's the one.

542
01:07:33,469 --> 01:07:35,569
Do you ever have a car stolen?

543
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,669
No, what?

544
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,670
Cause the car that
allegedly hit you was your own.

545
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:46,670
1969, red pontiac viper
registered to your name.

546
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,471
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totally wrecked.

547
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:02,571
Do you know it is a felony
to file a bogus police report?

548
01:08:04,671 --> 01:08:07,072
Hey, wait a minute.
You got some explaining to do.

549
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:07,972
Hey! Hey!

550
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,180
Jesus, Reznik. Just wanna talk to you.

551
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,081
Hey come back. Reznik, Reznik!

552
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:07,289
Trevor?

553
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:11,089
Oh, no.

554
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,589
Trevor, what do you want?

555
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,390
Trevor, it's okay.

556
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:30,690
Oh God, what happend?

557
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:35,991
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.

558
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:39,692
Did he stop?

559
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:44,092
No, he just kept going.

560
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,192
He fucking hit my drivers man.

561
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,592
He gotta be hanged.

562
01:11:50,893 --> 01:11:52,292
It was my fault.

563
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:54,493
I wasn't paying attention.

564
01:11:55,093 --> 01:11:57,193
Trevor, we got get you to a hospital.

565
01:11:58,593 --> 01:11:59,993
You may have some internal injuries.

566
01:11:59,993 --> 01:12:01,594
it is just bruises.

567
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:03,393
Okay, you see this?

568
01:12:03,993 --> 01:12:07,194
This is a bruise,
and this is a train wreck, alright?

569
01:12:08,794 --> 01:12:11,094
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?

570
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:15,094
I trust you.

571
01:12:16,495 --> 01:12:18,595
Now I know.
You are crazy.

572
01:12:20,195 --> 01:12:21,595
Can I stay here tonight?

573
01:12:22,595 --> 01:12:24,495
Babe, you can stay here every night.

574
01:12:25,945 --> 01:12:26,996
You know that?

575
01:12:29,396 --> 01:12:30,196
What?

576
01:12:31,496 --> 01:12:34,196
What,Babe,
what's going on in that crazy head of yours?

577
01:12:35,996 --> 01:12:37,597
I really want this to work, Stevie

578
01:12:41,297 --> 01:12:42,097
But?

579
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:46,198
You know so little about me.

580
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:50,197
What if I turned into a warewolf or something?

581
01:12:54,098 --> 01:12:56,098
I will buy you a flea collar.

582
01:13:02,099 --> 01:13:02,999
I love you.

583
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,800
Stevie

584
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,699
Yeah.

585
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,200
Thanks.

586
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:32,802
I set out some clean cloth for you,
your stuff is not dry yet.

587
01:13:33,502 --> 01:13:35,302
You always keep men's cloth lying around?

588
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:40,002
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep their clean change cloth here.

589
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:42,702
I probably just throw
them out now, alright?

590
01:13:43,403 --> 01:13:45,003
Hey, perfect fit.

591
01:13:46,803 --> 01:13:48,103
Yeah, whatever Trevor.

592
01:13:48,503 --> 01:13:50,853
I don't have a size 26 waist here.

593
01:13:51,904 --> 01:13:53,503
Hey, how about that idea.

594
01:13:54,504 --> 01:13:56,053
I can get a job selling man's wear.

595
01:13:57,304 --> 01:13:59,605
Those chicks got paid vacations too.

596
01:14:00,304 --> 01:14:01,804
I'll settle for that.

597
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,704
That's not a bad life.

598
01:14:05,205 --> 01:14:07,005
Could be worse.
You know whatelse I want to do?

599
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:11,505
I want to clean up this place,
just get rid of all the fucking junk.

600
01:14:12,405 --> 01:14:14,905
Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper,
which I sometimes am...

601
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:18,405
...but I can also be very very,
you know, organised and neat.

602
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:20,106
And I wanna do more of that.

603
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:23,006
I would love to paint a place.

604
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:28,307
Just make it nice, just be organised,
and neat and paint it white.

605
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:34,407
What I would also like is a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.

606
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,910
()Just like a white, beautiful place
and a decent stove.

607
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:04,510
Not a lot to ask.

608
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:11,611
Wow, don't look so surprised.
A call girl scrambling eggs...

609
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:18,011
Yeah that's funny,
I dont think I ever cooked for a guy before.

610
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:22,112
Not even my husband.

611
01:15:25,612 --> 01:15:27,012
Jesus Christ.

612
01:15:28,312 --> 01:15:29,212
Where is he?

613
01:15:31,312 --> 01:15:32,012
Who?

614
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:33,113
You know who.

615
01:15:35,913 --> 01:15:37,713
- Trevor.
- Don't.

616
01:15:39,913 --> 01:15:42,014
Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?

617
01:15:42,613 --> 01:15:45,014
This, Ivan.

618
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:47,714
He's your ex, isn't he?

619
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:48,714
What?

620
01:15:48,714 --> 01:15:50,114
Why is he doing this?

621
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:52,615
Just becuase i'm fucking you, isn't it?

622
01:15:53,614 --> 01:15:54,814
Now it all makes sense.

623
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:57,715
I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me.

624
01:15:57,715 --> 01:15:58,515
Where is he?

625
01:15:58,515 --> 01:16:00,615
Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?

626
01:16:00,615 --> 01:16:02,715
I don't know what you are talking about, babe.

627
01:16:02,715 --> 01:16:04,715
Ah, don't babe me.

628
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:07,316
Yeah, babe.

629
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:12,116
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
I'll do anything you want, babe.

630
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:16,967
You know what, I don't deserve this.

631
01:16:17,217 --> 01:16:18,067
What did you do?

632
01:16:18,717 --> 01:16:21,717
- Hey!
- Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?

633
01:16:21,717 --> 01:16:22,617
Fuck you!

634
01:16:23,017 --> 01:16:25,518
- You left it in my tip jar the other night.
- Bullshit.

635
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:28,618
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
- Cut the crap, Stevie.

636
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:34,018
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit.

637
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:38,919
- This says he does.
- Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.

638
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:40,519
I'm talking about your ex!

639
01:16:40,918 --> 01:16:41,719
Ivan.

640
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,120
- Who? This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.

641
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,219
Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you.

642
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,920
You are stading next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

643
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:05,821
That's not me.

644
01:17:10,421 --> 01:17:15,022
Trevor, it's you.
Look.

645
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:24,223
You lying whore.

646
01:17:28,423 --> 01:17:29,723
You get the fuck out.

647
01:17:29,723 --> 01:17:31,424
Fucking freak.

648
01:17:31,424 --> 01:17:34,224
You are a fucking pig

649
01:17:34,224 --> 01:17:35,424
You fucking whore

650
01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:38,124
You are a fucking freak.

651
01:17:38,124 --> 01:17:40,824
You are a fucking psycho.

652
01:17:40,824 --> 01:18:00,226
Fucking psycho

653
01:18:28,128 --> 01:18:30,828
Where is Marie?

654
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:32,029
Who?

655
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:34,929
You know who.

656
01:18:34,929 --> 01:18:37,930
Marie my waitress.

657
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:41,530
My! You are chatty tonight.

658
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:45,530
Darling, I am your waitress!

659
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:46,330
What's going on here?

660
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,031
I've never seen you before.

661
01:18:48,031 --> 01:18:50,130
What are you talking about?

662
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:55,131
You come here every night, stay on that same stool, staring at your coffee.

663
01:18:56,731 --> 01:19:00,131
Honest, I am starting to think that you are mute.

664
01:19:00,131 --> 01:19:02,732
I wanna see Marie!

665
01:19:02,732 --> 01:19:07,732
Mister, there is no Marie that works here.

666
01:19:10,033 --> 01:19:14,533
Is everybody at it?

667
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:19,533
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.

668
01:19:20,033 --> 01:19:23,433
Whatever Ivan was paying you is wasting his money.

669
01:19:23,433 --> 01:19:26,133
Go home, Mister.

670
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:31,134
Get some sleep.

671
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:58,042
How could you!

672
01:22:15,149 --> 01:22:19,550
You have to pay your utility bill, partner

673
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:24,350
You know how difficult it is to shave in the dark.

674
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:29,350
What have you done with Nicholas?

675
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:35,051
What have I done with Nicholas?

676
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:44,752
He can't hear you now, pal.

677
01:22:45,952 --> 01:22:50,952
Oh, come on what know what you is dead. heya

678
01:22:53,953 --> 01:22:58,953
You going to do something with that faulty memory of yours. Pal

679
01:22:59,553 --> 01:23:03,154
Might make life a little bit easier.

680
01:23:03,154 --> 01:23:08,154
by the way, I just loved them no chilly myself

681
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:16,955
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.

682
01:23:18,355 --> 01:23:23,356
Where is your hospitality, partner?

683
01:23:28,656 --> 01:23:33,657
If some had walked in, he might get the wrong idea.

684
01:25:36,868 --> 01:25:37,768
Who are you?

685
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:44,168
Oh hell, look like you got
some explaining to do, partner.

686
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:48,275
I know who you are.

687
01:28:53,585 --> 01:28:55,286
You going some where, Mr. Reznik?

688
01:28:57,486 --> 01:29:00,287
Yeah, Mrs.shrike, I'm moving.

689
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:02,286
I didn't receive notice.

690
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:05,787
Your lease requires you
to get 30 days notice in writing.

691
01:29:06,787 --> 01:29:09,187
It wasn't planned,
something came up.

692
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:13,487
You can keep my security deposite.
I won't be needing it anyway.

693
01:29:16,788 --> 01:29:21,288
Really? Mr. Reznik.
You used to be such a good tenant.

694
01:29:22,588 --> 01:29:24,088
I just don't understand it.

695
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,939
Oh, isn't that pretty?

696
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,490
Would you care to sell it?

697
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,191
No, it was my mother's.

698
01:29:50,191 --> 01:29:54,891
I made all arrangements. Don't move my things.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.

699
01:29:55,192 --> 01:29:55,891
You just want to get away...

700
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:58,392
If you are going to give it away...

701
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:03,392
Mrs. Shrike, If you'll excuse me.

702
01:30:58,897 --> 01:31:00,497
I like to report a hit-and-run.

703
01:31:16,098 --> 01:31:17,799
Some one will record your statement.

704
01:31:18,799 --> 01:31:24,199
Later, right now I just want to sleep.

705
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,101
Just want to sleep.
