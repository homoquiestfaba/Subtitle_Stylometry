you should have
little reason for that.

176
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,666
Why in god's name
would you move to Jersey?

177
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,336
-The countryside.

178
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:47,737
It's only like an hour
outside Philly.

179
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,112
There really are
some lovely areas.

180
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:51,047
-Please, mom.

181
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:52,848
You can't put lipstick on a pig.

182
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,487
-Watch your mouth.
-What did I say?

183
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,793
-Your mother and I have been
wanting to get out of the city

184
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,963
for a long time,
go someplace quiet.

185
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:00,967
-Why can't you put lipstick
on a pig?

186
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,568
-I can work on my book.

187
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:04,775
Mom can find a teaching job.

188
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,044
-Yoga. Mm-hmm.

189
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:08,945
-Besides, we can't afford
the area anymore.

190
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:12,256
-Please tell me
you're not selling the house.

191
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:15,396
Wha-- j-Jane's okay with this?
You're okay with this?

192
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:19,304
What about your internship
and your class and her routines?

193
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:21,876
You guys know how important
her routines are to her.

194
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,677
W-what about Maggie and Hannah?

195
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:27,323
And what happens to Jane?

196
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,328
-They want her
to move in with us.

197
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,802
They want her to live with us.

198
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:36,471
Can you believe that?

199
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:39,512
I mean, I guess she wants to, as
well. I can't really blame her.

200
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:41,782
It's a hell
of a housewarming gift... -A beautiful bird.

201
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:43,252
-...bringing home
my autistic sister. -Make a man cry

202
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,487
Flies through the air
like an angel.

203
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:45,657
-Could you hold that thought?

204
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,059
-Yeah. Sure, pal.
Take your time.

205
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,395
We're just talking birds, okay?
-Thank you.

206
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:49,796
-All right.
-Hey.

207
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,436
-Babe, did you hear
what I just said?

208
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:54,507
-Uh, yeah, I heard you.

209
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,677
-And what do you think?

210
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:58,148
- Ugh!

211
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,949
Jesus Christ.

212
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,254
-What do you want to do?

213
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:04,055
-I want to be with you,
you know?

214
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:07,901
Focus on us.
-Yes, right. Yes.

215
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:09,772
I love janey to death.
She is the best.

216
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:12,911
I just...

217
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:14,447
I don't know
that I would be comfortable

218
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,984
with that responsibility,
you know?

219
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,185
-Yes. Exactly.
That's what I told them.

220
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,727
-You told your parents
i didn't want her moving in.

221
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,228
That's not good.
Thanks.

222
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,467
-No, babe.
I just said that you might not

223
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:26,938
be 100% cool with it.

224
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,375
They were grilling the shit
out of me,

225
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,945
and I had to say something.

226
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,916
-Okay, yeah, right.
Listen, no problem.

227
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,917
Um, I have to finish this,

228
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,757
uh, interview
with this insane person

229
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:36,826
that Hewitt put me up to,

230
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,061
and I got to somehow spin this

231
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:41,167
and make this interesting
or readable.

232
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:44,207
I don't know. Um, so tonight,
why don't we do this?

233
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,644
I'm gonna make you
a late dinner,

234
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:46,879
we're gonna
crack open some wine,

235
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,148
and I'm going to hug you
and kiss you,

236
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,818
and we are gonna
celebrate your graduation

237
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,819
from working for tips, okay?

238
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,091
-Yeah.
No, I get it.

239
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,102
I'll talk to you later.

240
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,278
-Semipalmated plover.
-There he is.

241
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,979
Plover, yes.
Beautiful creature.

242
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,619
I guess the point
I'm trying to get at, buddy,

243
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,856
is the teenagers come in here
at night when I'm not here.

244
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,092
They won't let me
stay overnight --

245
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,595
another story entirely.

246
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:16,766
-Jane, come on. Open up.

247
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,509
<i>-What?</i>

248
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,884
-I've got your pancakes here,
and you only had like one bite.

249
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,715
-I'm not hungry.

250
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:26,493
<i>-I'm not going back to him.</i>

251
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,425
<i>-That's silly.</i>

252
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:33,473
<i>Of course</i>
<i>you're going back to him.</i>

253
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,246
<i>Well,</i>
<i>if you don't go back to him,</i>

254
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:38,750
<i>you'll spoil everything for us.</i>

255
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,551
<i>You can see that, can't you?</i>

256
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,372
-You smell like smoke.
Mom's gonna say something.

257
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:53,011
<i>-If I stay married</i>
<i>and keep you on the side...</i>

258
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,215
-I'm sorry I got so frustrated
at the table.

259
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,585
<i>-... and when I'm lonely...</i>

260
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:59,986
-It's just a lot to take in
on the spot.

261
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,631
You know?
<i>-Oh, brother.</i>

262
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,332
-M-mom and dad just --

263
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,605
-shh!

264
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,336
I love this part.

265
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:11,874
<i>-Is that what you</i>
<i>expected of me?</i>

266
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:16,191
<i>-Helen, listen.</i>

267
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,102
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

268
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,836
<i>-Suddenly I've gotten</i>
<i>very cold feet.</i>

269
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,720
-Hey, I'm having a housewarming
party tomorrow night, Jane.

270
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,391
I want you to come.

271
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:38,997
We can talk about all this scary
moving stuff later, okay?

272
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,946
You'll come, won't you?

273
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,349
We've talked about this, Jane.

274
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,820
You have to get
out of the house more often.

275
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:50,025
We've talked about it, right?

276
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,126
-Okay, fine.

277
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,698
I'll go.
Just be quiet, please.

278
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:58,642
I can't listen to you and have
my eyes work at the same time.

279
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,084
-Okay.

280
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:06,257
<i>-Charlie...</i>

281
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,228
-I need that fucking squash
in two.

282
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,263
-It's coming.
It's coming.

283
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,499
-Don't you fuck with me, José.

284
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,637
- Pick up! Thank you.

285
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:16,108
-Eta on those lobsters?
Who's working those lobsters?

286
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,582
Somebody better be working
those fucking lobsters.

287
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,218
-Here's your re-cook --
medium-rare.

288
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,689
Hope the bastard chokes.

289
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,058
-Yeah, very good, very good.

290
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,329
-I told you I'm gonna
make that happen, right?

291
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,464
Kim the waitress?

292
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,834
Eyebrows?
-Ohh.

293
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,135
-Eyebrows.
-No.

294
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:30,237
-Yeah.
-Beautiful.

295
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,909
-Jackie boy, how's it hanging?

296
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,146
-Hey, gyp.

297
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:35,877
Not bad, man.
Was in the weeds.

298
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,520
Now I'm not in the weeds.

299
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,290
-That's great.

300
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:45,571
Say, Jack, got anything
on the back burner for me?

301
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:50,012
I'm fresh out of new recipes.

302
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,949
-Sure.

303
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,619
Yeah, gyp,
let me whip something up.

304
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:04,306
A filet of brook trout with
crushed pistachios and walnuts

305
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:06,177
drizzled
with a light gray fruit butter.

306
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:07,947
There's some vegetables
and shit in there, too.

307
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,448
-Wow.
You made this for me?

308
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:12,056
-With my own blood,
sweat, tears,

309
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,895
and a little bit of snot.
-Ah.

310
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:17,126
Ah, that smells amazing.
-Don't mention it.

311
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,803
Figured everyone deserves
a last meal.

312
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,372
I'm meeting one
of the waitresses

313
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:21,975
when she gets off, so why don't
we open up a tab, huh?

314
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:23,512
- "Jack's tab."

315
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:26,284
Right.
What happened to Christy?

316
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:27,787
- Oh, it's Kim now.

317
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:29,858
- Kim's the waitress?

318
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,359
-Yeah, Kim's the waitress.

319
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,268
-Christy seemed nice.
You two were cool together.

320
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:36,605
-Yeah, just different schedules.

321
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,536
You know.

322
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:41,114
-Some things
were getting serious, huh?

323
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,845
-Things were never serious.

324
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,957
Looks like everyone's
got the same idea, huh?

325
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,228
-Hmm. Yeah.
It pays to have regulars.

326
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:52,336
- You got some nice regulars.
Oh, shit.

327
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:53,437
Oh, man.

328
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:54,975
I can't believe
it's your last night.

329
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,410
And some company
for the occasion.

330
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:57,814
The only other guy
in here looks like a pirate.

331
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:01,487
-And it's still early.
How about that?

332
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:05,596
-Well, here's to you,
a fully employed actress

333
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:09,504
supporting herself
off the fruits of her own labor.

334
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:10,905
Mazel tov.

335
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,778
-Here's to paying equity dues.

336
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,056
Mm.

337
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,427
-You look like you been
sucking on a lemon.

338
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,832
What is the problem?
Not enough presents for you?

339
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,204
-No, it's just...

340
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:27,805
It's been a long day.

341
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:29,478
That's all.

342
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:33,619
-Come on.
It's your last night.

343
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,355
Just don't take my lucky.

344
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,086
Don't look at me like that.

345
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:38,228
It's late.
He doesn't care.

346
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,269
Look at this guy.

347
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:45,213
Attagirl.

348
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:49,046
Give me one of these.

349
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,364
-Mm.

350
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:57,428
-How's my Robbie boy?

351
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,136
Excited for his big
coming-out party tomorrow?

352
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:02,007
He's insane.

353
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:07,219
-Ugh.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

354
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:37,714
Hey. Welcome to fish bar,
where it's always happy hour.

355
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,751
Watch out for that puke there.

356
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,020
-Oh.
-What you got?

357
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,421
Cookies?
Excellent.

358
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,533
You can leave those with me.

359
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:49,504
I'm just joking.

360
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:50,773
You can put them right over here

361
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,214
with all the other goodies.

362
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,248
Chocolate chip?

363
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:56,685
- Where's Bianca?

364
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:58,822
-She's getting the mop
for that mess over there.

365
00:15:58,823 --> 00:15:59,991
-Here.

366
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,292
Have a seat.

367
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,930
I've been saving this seat
for a pretty gal

368
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,331
going on 10 minutes now.

369
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,414
What are you drinking?

370
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:11,715
Or stand.
Standing's good, too.

371
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:14,616
-You just said you were
saving it for someone.

372
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,696
-I'm sorry.
Is it the smoke? Here.

373
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,104
There.
It's out.

374
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,905
-You really shouldn't do that.

375
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:27,309
It's bad for you.

376
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,715
And it's illegal
to smoke indoors

377
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,186
in the state of New York.
-I've heard that.

378
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:35,458
I've also heard
that cookies make your butt big.

379
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:39,065
Well, I'd rather have
a big cookie butt than be dead.

380
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,739
- Yeah,
'cause then you could eat

381
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,309
your own big cookie butt.

382
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:52,697
-Stop it.
I'm not that funny.

383
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,128
You'll make my head big.

384
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,203
Jesus.

385
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:01,915
You, uh...

386
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,685
You must be
in the Bianca's regulars club.

387
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:05,786
I'm a member, too.
I'm Jack.

388
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,459
It's okay.
They're clean.

389
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,770
-Can you just tell her
i brought her cookies?

390
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,206
They're her favorite.

391
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,777
-Yeah, sure.

392
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:18,576
-It was nice meeting you!

393
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,493
- Who should I say you are?

394
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,899
That's a fucking good cookie.

395
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:07,045
-She's my sis
and you take care of family,

396
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:08,515
but what they're asking,

397
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,946
it's like they're forcing me
to say it.

398
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,523
- Say what?

399
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,727
-Well, there's no nice way
of telling someone you love them

400
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,397
but you don't want them around.

401
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,802
-No, you don't have to explain
yourself to me. I get it.

402
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:20,304
If Mischa wanted
to move in with me,

403
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:21,875
I'd be like, "hell no, bitch."

404
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,306
-Right?

405
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:25,582
-They're asking me to take on
a full-time job

406
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,622
when I'm about to be up to my
tits in eight shows per week.

407
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:32,830
And looking after her isn't
exactly a cakewalk, you know?

408
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,201
-I know. I remember how she was
in high school.

409
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:38,040
But she seems much better now.

410
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,142
-No, yeah, you're right.

411
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,013
She is better.

412
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:42,783
There's just a lot.

413
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:45,321
She's... a lot.

414
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:47,058
-Well,
then why did you invite her?

415
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,194
-Hi, Robbie.

416
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,325
-Hi, uh, Cynthia on my table.

417
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:51,735
-What was that, honey?

418
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:53,337
-I just said,
why did you invite her, then,

419
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:54,607
if you don't want
to deal with her all night?

420
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,276
-Well,
i had to cheer her up somehow,

421
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:58,481
and pancakes weren't exactly
doing the trick.

422
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,719
-I just -- I don't -- i-i
don't want you to keep an eye

423
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,955
on her the whole time is all.

424
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,925
-I got it covered, babe.
-Yeah, I know.

425
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,230
I just -- I have a lot of
friends coming from work is all.

426
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:08,635
-So?

427
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:10,104
-So I'm just stressed.

428
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,605
Forget I said anything.

429
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:13,043
-Is that why you're wearing
a tie?

430
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:15,181
-You don't like this?
-I got to go get dressed.

431
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:17,492
Cynthia, bowl these.
-Okay.

432
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:51,793
<i>-Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors, please.</i>

433
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:04,775
-It's such a --
it's a pleasure to meet you.

434
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,588
Good evening.
My name's Jane.

435
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,293
It's a pleasure to meet you.

436
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,030
Good evening.
My name's Jane.

437
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:14,399
It's a pleasure to meet you.

438
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,069
You do know my sister.

439
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,670
Ugh.

440
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,585
-Oh, Bianca,
how's playing titania?

441
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,830
-Oh, my god. Wait.
Is that the "midsummer"

442
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,135
directed by Harrison west?
-When did this happen?

443
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,666
How'd you get the part?

444
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,611
-Um, there was an open casting
call on backstage, and --

445
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,548
-didn't he direct "die hard 6"
or something?

446
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,484
-I think it is incredible
how he is making

447
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:43,085
the transition
from screen to stage.

448
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:45,194
-That's so amazing, b. B.

449
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:46,664
I'm, like, so happy for you.

450
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:47,965
-Thank you.
Thank you.

451
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,968
Just -- can you
excuse me one minute?

452
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:51,272
Sorry, guys.

453
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:54,513
-Already a fucking diva.

454
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,316
- Ew.

455
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:58,354
-So -- -oop, oop, oop.
-So, yeah.

456
00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,724
-Wait. When is the wedding?

457
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,561
-Uh, well, we haven't set a date
just yet.

458
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,798
-Well, are you thinking
a summer wedding?

459
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,569
-Uh, not sure. Uh, most of
my family lives in Boston now.

460
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:07,906
Most of hers are here.

461
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:10,977
It's just a question
of where to funnel them.

462
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:14,887
-I've always wanted
to get married someplace warm

463
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,088
like the Bahamas.

464
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,799
Nice digs, Robbie boy.

465
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,300
-Uh, thanks, my man.
We are very happy with it.

466
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:26,778
Uh, a lot less noisy
than the village was, you know?

467
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,517
Uh, low crime.
Subway's just two blocks away.

468
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:30,852
Came with this awesome swing.

469
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:33,825
-Relax, rob.
We're not looking to buy it.

470
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,127
-All around,
we're pretty jazzed.

471
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,430
-Really?
You're jazzed?

472
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,400
Jesus. Oh, excuse me.

473
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,271
Boy, sure can jam in a crowd.

474
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:41,406
Who are all these people, man?

475
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,645
Do I know any of these people?

476
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,676
-Well, if you don't,
this is, uh --

477
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:48,487
this is typically
where you would meet them.

478
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,359
-I guess you don't pal around
with the old posse anymore, huh?

479
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,199
-Well, you're here.

480
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,569
-Hmm.
-Yes.

481
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,539
Yes, we are.

482
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,079
-So, um... uh...

483
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
-Kim.
-... Kim,

484
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:05,421
you must know Jack
from the restaurant, then.

485
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,458
-Yeah.

486
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,459
-Nyu.
-What?

487
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,734
-She goes to Fordham.
-Fordham?

488
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,270
I have a good friend
who works there -- bill Manning.

489
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:16,309
He's adjunct, teaches a couple
of journalism classes.

490
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,880
You must've heard of him.

491
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:19,953
-No.

492
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,227
I'm gonna go get another drink.
-Hey, sure.

493
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:26,964
Get me one, too, huh?

494
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:32,743
-Whoa. What are you doing?
-Oh. Sorry.

495
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:35,281
Didn't see you.

496
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:36,551
-Can she drink?

497
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:37,986
-Yeah, she can.
Don't be an asshole.

498
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,355
-I'm sorry. I'm just teasing.

499
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:40,825
You have to catch me up
to speed.

500
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,196
Tell me... what happened
with the Christy chick?

501
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,100
-Why does everyone
keep bringing Christy up?

502
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:48,106
That's ancient history.
-Okay. I'm sorry, man.

503
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:49,743
I had no idea you guys
weren't together anymore.

504
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,213
Apologies. Please.

505
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:54,152
Tell me more about this, um...

506
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:57,593
...this Fordham chick who is
drinking all of my good wine.

507
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,565
That's a $100 bottle.

508
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,836
-Oh, well, excuse me.

509
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:05,907
-How's that food, Jane?

510
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,380
Rob was marinating
those suckers all night.

511
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:10,084
-It's all right.

512
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:12,021
-Just because it's
not grilled cheese

513
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:13,691
doesn't mean it's not good.

514
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,261
-What's the matter
with grilled cheese?

515
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:18,672
-Nothing -- as long
as you don't eat it every day.

516
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:23,377
- Sorry.

517
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:25,878
Next time, it's a light puree.

518
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,919
-Hey, is that daddy's shirt?

519
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,725
-Yeah, he said I could wear it.
-Oh.

520
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,829
Well, if you want,
you can go hit my closet,

521
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,365
find something dressier.

522
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:35,696
-No, I like this shirt.

523
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,773
This is dad's writing shirt.

524
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:40,110
Remember?
I sewed the button back on.

525
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:42,181
-There it is.

526
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:44,552
What do you say
we try to go join the party?

527
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,655
We can't really
stay in the kitchen

528
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,024
all night eating all the grub.

529
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,455
-There are a lot of people here.

530
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:51,701
-Yeah, and they are all nice.

531
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,205
Isn't that right?
-Yeah.

532
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:55,806
I make a mean Margarita.

533
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,178
Helps me relax.

534
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,215
Makes talking
to all these people easier.

535
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:01,186
How about I make you one?
-How about we don't?

536
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:03,987
And she'll just have soda.
-No, I'd like one.

537
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,196
I had a beer with dad
in Cape Cod last summer.

538
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:09,567
I can answer for myself,
thank you very much.

539
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:10,705
-Fine.

540
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:11,974
A little one.

541
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,135
-Got it.

542
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,725
-Jane, you are looking
fabulous tonight.

543
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,526
I am loving that sexy man shirt
on you.

544
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:24,632
-Whoa. Easy.

545
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:26,871
-What?
She looks beautiful.

546
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:28,808
All the guys
are gonna want a piece of you.

547
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,545
-Cynthia, zip it.

548
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,646
-Why don't you zip it?

549
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,820
Maybe I want to turn some heads.

550
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,491
It's none of your business.

551
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:40,672
-I'm gonna go see if anyone
else wants a Margarita.

552
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:46,342
-You don't have to stay here
and babysitting me all night,

553
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,953
so how about you just
butt out of it?

554
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:07,051
-Boo!
-Oh, fuck, Jack.

555
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,621
You scared the shit out of me,
rob.

556
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:09,992
-I know.

557
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,832
-Come on.
-Ugh.

558
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,114
Ay-yi-yi-yi.
-Just don't take my lucky.

559
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,276
-Bad influence.

560
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:27,125
Mm.

561
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,034
Quite the crowd in there.

562
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,535
You should've charged a cover.

563
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,739
-Hmm.

564
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,610
-You look beat.

565
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:38,380
-I noticed
you brought a plus-one.

566
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:40,518
Kim from the bar?

567
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,219
-She's not "Kim from the bar."

568
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:43,490
She's just Kimberly.

569
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:46,029
Or Kim. She likes Kim.
-Got it.

570
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,899
-By the way, don't let
this sour you on her forever,

571
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,470
but she's currently
in your bathroom vomiting.

572
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,709
-Forever?

573
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,045
That's a big word for you, Jack.

574
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:57,084
Three whole syllables.

575
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,155
-I didn't mean forever.

576
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:04,065
I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing here.

577
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,466
-Yeah, well, the party's inside.

578
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:10,277
Everybody up there -- I don't
have anything to say to them.

579
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,078
It's like, what are we supposed
to talk about?

580
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,786
All I'm hearing is people
inviting each other

581
00:26:14,787 --> 00:26:16,757
to dinner parties and weddings.

582
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,758
-You jealous?
-No.

583
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:21,600
I mean,
I'm not jealous. Maybe...

584
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,838
I feel a little left out.

585
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,639
Does that sound gay?
-Mm.

586
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,113
-I'm trying to be serious.

587
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:30,183
It's like...

588
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:34,325
It's like everybody went
and joined the grown-up club,

589
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,966
and it just dawned on me
that I forgot to.

590
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,637
-What are you talking about?
Jack, you're fine.

591
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:43,209
You're a sous-chef at
a restaurant in New York City.

592
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,648
-Come on.
We got 3h stars on yelp.

593
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:46,950
-I'm just saying you're fine.

594
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:48,854
You're -- you've got a job...

595
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:50,215
-Yeah...
-... you got Kim.

596
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,862
- That's it.
That's all I have.

597
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,367
My Facebook feed
is just like fucking clogged

598
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:58,206
with party photos
and vacation photos

599
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,237
and wedding photos
and baby pictures.

600
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,782
-Yeah.
-Everybody i know is fucking multiplying.

601
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:04,986
-Mm-hmm. You want kids?

602
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:09,927
-No. With overpopulation
and famine and ice caps melting?

603
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:11,331
No, it's -- it's selfish.

604
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,904
Maybe someday,
but that's not the point.

605
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:14,973
-Well, what is the point?

606
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:16,814
I'm starting to get cold.

607
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,956
-Everybody...

608
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,827
Is doing something
with their lives.

609
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,869
That's my point.

610
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:33,507
You, rob -- everybody.

611
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:36,582
And then there's me.

612
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,888
Almost a decade after college,
I'm still single,

613
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,658
I'm still a line cook.

614
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,595
-Hey, sous-chef.

615
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:43,726
-Exactly.

616
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,002
I'm not <i>the</i> chef.

617
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:47,839
-What's with all the beer tears?

618
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,110
This is very un-Jack-like.

619
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,861
Forget it. I'm gonna collect
my date and go home.

620
00:27:59,864 --> 00:28:01,332
-Oh, come on.
Don't mope.

621
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,243
-I'm not moping.
-You're moping.

622
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:07,211
-Thanks for the lovely evening.

623
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:08,948
Give Robbie a goodnight kiss
for me.

624
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:11,485
-You're moping.
-I'm not moping.

625
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:36,597
-Mnh.

626
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:38,114
Mnh-mnh.

627
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:42,254
-Excuse me just for a second.

628
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:47,892
Hey, janey.

629
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,495
How are you?

630
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,526
Good evening, Robert.

631
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:55,775
You having a good time?
You look...Very nice.

632
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,246
-I like your tie.
-Thanks.

633
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:02,217
I, uh -- I got it at a, um...

634
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:04,224
Thanks.
-Are those fish?

635
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:07,164
-I actually think
they might be baby seals --

636
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:09,765
seals playing with balls.

637
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,305
-I read your article
the other day --

638
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:13,109
the one about the whale
the washed up on the beach.

639
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,980
-Yeah, a baleen.
Big suckers.

640
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:17,091
Look like they got mustaches.

641
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,929
Uh, you want to meet
some of my friends from work?

642
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,801
They, uh -- they also wrote
interesting articles, you know?

643
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:27,839
-No, I'm just gonna stay here.

644
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,340
-Oh.

645
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,345
You want me to stay with you?

646
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,946
-That's okay.
Thanks, though.

647
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,420
-All right.

648
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:37,024
Have fun.

649
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,125
I'm right over here
if you need me.

650
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:40,999
All right.
Aye-aye, captain.

651
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:44,713
Okay.

652
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:29,428
-You okay?

653
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,129
Don't look.

654
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,835
-All right.

655
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:17,525
You looking at me?

656
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,965
- Hey.

657
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:40,296
Don't run off!

658
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,644
I just want to talk.

659
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,048
-Are you following me?
-No.

660
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,488
Well, yeah, sort of.

661
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:51,125
I j-- I just wanted
to apologize.

662
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:52,862
I didn't mean
to scare you back there.

663
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:55,400
A little jumpy, aren't you?

664
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:57,771
-How long were you spying on me?

665
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,509
- Not long.

666
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,911
And I wasn't spying.
I was just --

667
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:02,480
I was just watching you.

668
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:05,921
Only for a minute, though.
I didn't mean to be creepy.

669
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:07,558
-I don't do that all the time,

670
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,328
stare at people,
just so you know.

671
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,131
It's just sometimes I don't know
what to say to people,

672
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,770
so I watch them.

673
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,511
-I hear that.

674
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:24,886
I figured since we didn't get
to have that drink last night...

675
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:27,203
Oh, here.
Let me.

676
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:38,285
Geez.

677
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,559
Fucking finally. Sorry.

678
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:45,065
That was supposed to look cool.

679
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:46,797
-It was cool.

680
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,211
-You thought that was cool?

681
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,148
I think you're pretty cool.

682
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:07,243
Those were some killer cookies
you made last night, by the way.

683
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:10,551
And I would know.
I'm a chef.

684
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:12,855
Chin chin.

685
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,926
Cheers.

686
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,257
-Cheers.

687
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:32,391
They really can see everything
from up here, can't they?

688
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,607
-The empire state building
is the one that really matters.

689
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,746
As long as you can see that,
you know where you really are.

690
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:44,384
Without it,
you may as well be anywhere.

691
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:47,985
It's one of the wonders
of the world, you know?

692
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,564
I just don't understand that.

693
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:52,425
I understand it
may be interesting

694
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:55,707
that humans built it,
but a wonder?

695
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,478
Awe-inspiring?

696
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,582
I just don't get
you neurotypicals

697
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,385
and what you find awesome.

698
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:05,794
A storm on Jupiter
bigger than our whole planet,

699
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,795
black holes...

700
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:12,206
Stars collapsing
in on themselves and dying?

701
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:13,837
That I get.

702
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:18,720
You can see a star's death
for weeks after it's gone.

703
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:22,528
All that matter flying
though the interstellar medium

704
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,029
faster than the speed of light!

705
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,803
It's almost like it never died.

706
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:31,011
-Are you an astronomer
or something?

707
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:33,817
-I'm a costume designer.

708
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,718
-How do you know so much
about space?

709
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:38,693
-I read.

710
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:41,666
I don't know that much, really.

711
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:50,481
-Is it okay if I sit?

712
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:55,562
I suppose so if you want to.

713
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:00,808
♪♪

714
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:08,185
-Would now be a good time
to catch your name?

715
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:10,356
I already told you mine.

716
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:11,487
-Jack.

717
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:12,861
-Your name's Jack?

718
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:13,962
-No, your name's Jack.

719
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:16,134
- Oh, my god.
She remembers me!

720
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,935
She remembers me.

721
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,583
-Now, come on.
What should I call you?

722
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:25,854
-It's silly once I say it.
-Aw, what?

723
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,485
Come on.

724
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:37,477
-Jane.

725
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:41,552
- Jack and Jane.
I love it.

726
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:44,057
See? I told you it was silly.

727
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,161
Forget the empire state building
and black holes.

728
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:48,198
That just blew my mind.

729
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,375
-Hey. There you are.

730
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:54,576
-Hey, Bianca.

731
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:55,981
I didn't realize
you were looking for me.

732
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:57,651
-I-i wasn't. Um, janey,

733
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,087
why don't you
come back inside, hon?

734
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:01,124
Join the party, huh?
-But I like it up here.

735
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,594
-Come on. That's not safe.

736
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,464
-I'm having a good time.
-Jane, I said go back inside

737
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:06,595
and join the party.

738
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:08,273
Go.

739
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:13,015
-What the hell was that?

740
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:14,450
-What do you think you're doing?

741
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:16,488
-Look, i-i
know I've had a bad run-in

742
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:17,958
with a few of your friends,
but come on.

743
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,695
We were really hitting it off.
-What? Wait, wait.

744
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:20,896
Stop.

745
00:36:20,898 --> 00:36:22,738
That's my sister.

746
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,976
She didn't tell you that?

747
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,377
Okay, um, Jack,

748
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:32,554
look, do us both a favor
and stay away from her.

749
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:34,157
Y-you have no idea
what you're getting into,

750
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,961
so just stay away from her.
-What are you talking about?

751
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:37,664
We're just sitting here --
-i swear to fucking god, man.

752
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:39,367
You let a fart loose,
I'll know about it.

753
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:41,738
-Okay.
This is getting ridiculous.

754
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,576
Okay, so she's you sister.
I get it.

755
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:46,147
But what gives you the right --
she's a full-grown woman.

756
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:48,452
You're not her mother.
What are you -- -listen to me.

757
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:51,692
Get your rent-a-fuck
out of my bathroom

758
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:52,828
and take her wherever it is

759
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,430
the fuck you take
chicks like that,

760
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:56,368
but you aren't going anywhere
with Jane.

761
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:59,339
Do you understand me?

762
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,851
I swear to god.

763
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:14,866
Hey, Jane, where are you going?

764
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,809
-I can't believe you.
Why would you do that?

765
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,513
Why would you embarrass me
like that?

766
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:20,049
-I know you're pissed off
right now,

767
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,585
but, Jane, that guy --

768
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,422
-he's the only person
that talked to me all night,

769
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:26,428
and you scared him away.
-Yes. Yes, I did.

770
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:30,135
Because he is only talking to
you because he wants something.

771
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:31,966
He is not good for you.

772
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,943
Let's just go back inside.
-You smell like smoke.

773
00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:36,716
Get away from me!
-Please do not shout.

774
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:38,686
I have neighbors, Jane.

775
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:39,987
-Go away!

776
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,798
Stop hovering around me
all the time!

777
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,702
You don't even want me
talking to anyone.

778
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:48,305
Why did you invite me
if you don't trust me

779
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:51,506
to talk to anyone?
-It's Jack that I don't trust.

780
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,783
He is not the kind of guy
who would respect

781
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,854
how you're... different.

782
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:59,055
- Hey, everybody!
I'm different!

783
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:01,031
Big whoop-de-do!

784
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:04,437
Stop treating me
like I'm some baby.

785
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:07,878
-Well, then, why don't you
start acting like a grown-up?

786
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:12,516
-You don't care
about what I want.

787
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:15,059
You've never cared
about what I want.

788
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,265
-Yeah, Jane, I do.

789
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:21,036
Can you tell me?

790
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:23,738
What do you want?

791
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,847
-She wants a boyfriend.

792
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,548
That is so great!

793
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,322
-I'm just not sure
she's ready for a boyfriend.

794
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:33,863
I mean, at least she said she
wanted someone like rob, but...

795
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,468
-You thought
she'd never want one?

796
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:38,939
-She's always been
kind of a loner.

797
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,510
-You're just being
overprotective.

798
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:41,979
-Of course I am.

799
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,180
This is delicate.

800
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:46,522
I don't think
she's ever even been kissed.

801
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:48,492
-Well, have you asked her?
-No.

802
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,095
-Well, then, how do you know?!

803
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,496
- Ugh!

804
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:55,038
-She needs to go out.

805
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,207
We should go clubbing.

806
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,411
It would be a totally new
experience for her.

807
00:38:58,412 --> 00:39:01,184
She could let her hair down,
shake her tail feather.

808
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:05,055
-A nightclub. Yeah.
She'd fucking combust.

809
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:08,365
-Well, what about
a match.Com profile?

810
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:09,666
I'm on match.Com.

811
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:11,939
How's that working out for you?

812
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,740
-She just doesn't understand

813
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:15,580
what being in a relationship
involves.

814
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:16,782
I mean, everything she knows

815
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,653
she gets from watching
old movies.

816
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:20,657
And anyone we'd set her up with

817
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,528
wouldn't exactly be
expecting to walk her through it

818
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,300
or be an aspy's first date,
for that matter.

819
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,946
If we were to do something,
we would have to take it slow,

820
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:36,217
find someone who's just as new
at all this as she is.

821
00:39:36,222 --> 00:39:37,824
-Oh, my god.

822
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:39,160
There's this guy
i know from work.

823
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:41,531
He's super sweet.
His name is Steven.

824
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:45,105
I wouldn't go so far as to say
he's mentally handicapped,

825
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:46,474
but he's got something.

826
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:48,905
We only give him the easy stuff.

827
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:52,386
I think he could be perfect.

828
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:54,056
Come on.

829
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:55,927
Come on!

830
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:57,158
-I don't know.
-Come on.

831
00:39:57,163 --> 00:40:00,570
We're doing it.
-Well, how -- I --

832
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:03,211
♪♪

833
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:15,065
-Hey, janey.

834
00:40:15,066 --> 00:40:17,604
Cynthia and i
missed you at lunch.

835
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:18,906
-Well, I had a lot of work
to do,

836
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:21,745
so I decided to eat here today.

837
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:23,749
I'm comfortable
adjusting my routine,

838
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,187
for your information.

839
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:29,188
-Well, um, when I'm done
with rehearsal, what do you say?

840
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,834
You want to come
have dinner with me?

841
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:35,305
Well, take my keys,

842
00:40:35,306 --> 00:40:38,244
and when you're finished,
head to my place.

843
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:40,175
Take a shower.
Pick out something --

844
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:41,652
whatever you like.

845
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:43,663
Sound like a plan?

846
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:47,666
Cool.
See you about 6:00.

847
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,991
-Methinks, mistress,

848
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:37,864
you should have little reason
for that.

849
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,595
And yet, to say the truth,

850
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:43,876
reason and love keep little
company together nowadays.

851
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,477
'Tis more the pity
that some honest neighbors

852
00:41:46,482 --> 00:41:47,951
will not make them friends.

853
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:51,758
Nay, nay.
I can gleek upon occasion.

854
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,499
-Thou art as wise
as thou art beautiful.

855
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,300
-Oh, not so neither.

856
00:41:57,303 --> 00:42:00,041
But if I had wit enough
to get out of this wood,

857
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:02,079
I have enough to serve
mine own turn.

858
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,649
Toodles.

859
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,089
-Out of this wood
do not desire to go.

860
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,097
Thou shalt remain here
whether thou wilt or no.

861
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:15,168
I am a spirit of no common rate.

862
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,816
-Ugh!

863
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:25,391
Jesus fuck!

864
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:26,929
Have to get one of the techies

865
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,266
to put some glow tape or
something, perhaps some flares,

866

so it's safe.

867
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:34,744
-Titania, are you --
you present?

868
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:37,215
You with us?
-Yes.

869
00:42:37,216 --> 00:42:38,484
My apologies. I --

870
00:42:38,485 --> 00:42:40,315
-never apologize.

871
00:42:40,323 --> 00:42:44,263
You sound like an amateur
brown-nosing idiot.

872
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:45,866
No more fuck-ups!

873
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:51,545
We're too close to opening
for fuck-ups.

874
00:42:51,546 --> 00:42:53,376
From the top.

875
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:02,900
- Oh, I see their knavery.

876
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,201
This is to make an ass of me.

877
00:43:04,204 --> 00:43:08,344
-I said from the top, Jeffrey!

878
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:09,748
-Y-you mean the beginning
of the play?

879
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,486
- Yes!

880
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,804
Are all actors
this fucking stupid?

881
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:19,428
It was a joke, people.

882
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:21,505
You're doing great work.

883
00:43:21,506 --> 00:43:23,006
Great.

How's -- how's working

937
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:18,357

948
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:42,405

that's...Slow?

952
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,064
-Well, he's autistic.

953
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:58,335
-Right. Right.

954
00:46:58,338 --> 00:47:00,038
Right.

955
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,414
He's older?

956
00:47:03,415 --> 00:47:05,685
He's younger.

957
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:08,357
-He's 29.

958
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,408
Why?

959
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,569
-Just wondering.

960
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,377
-Thanks.

961
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:26,860
-Should've let me get
a cocktail.

962
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:28,865
-Be honest.
You didn't even want one.

963
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:31,766
-I had a drink at your place.

964
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:34,142
-Did you?

965
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,153
-Yeah. Cognac.

966
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:40,087
-Well,
i like what you picked out.

967
00:47:40,088 --> 00:47:41,888
I haven't worn that in forever.

968
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,799
-You wore it when we went
to see grandma last Christmas.

969
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,736
-Take it. It's yours.

970
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:50,174
-No, it's yours.
I got it from your closet.

971
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:52,345
-No, I mean,
i want you to have it.

972
00:47:52,346 --> 00:47:55,046
It looks really lovely on you.

973
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,234
-Rob likes me, right?
-Of course he does.

974
00:48:03,235 --> 00:48:04,804
-I just didn't know if you were
the only one

975
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:06,006
who didn't want me to move in,

976
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:08,007
or if he doesn't
want me to, either.

977
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:12,185
-Jane, look at me.

978
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:13,755
Hey. Eyes on me.

979
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:15,826
Rob likes you very much.

980
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:18,397
It's just we both feel that,

981
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,602
seeing as he and I have never
lived together before,

982
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:24,042
we have to focus on adjusting
to each other, you know?

983
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:25,344
-In other words,
you think I'll screw it up.

984
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:28,284
-That's not what I'm saying.

985
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:30,756
Can we just focus on having
a nice time together today?

986
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:32,826
-I know you think I'll be
a burden, but I'll be good.

987
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,828
I promise.

988
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:35,229
I'll clean up after myself

989
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,335
and I won't bother rob
when he's in his study

990
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:39,640
and I'll give you plenty
of alone time to make love.

991
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:42,780
-Jane, I'm sure you would.
That --

992
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:44,249
can we just talk
about something else right now?

993
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,351
-What else is there
to talk about?!

994
00:48:45,352 --> 00:48:46,821
We're running out of time!

995
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:48,925
Mom and dad already
started packing everything!

996
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,156
-Jane, I said not now.

997
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:52,733
Please.

998
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:10,041
Hey, I found you a date.

999
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:12,743
A friend of Cynthia's.

1000
00:49:14,464 --> 00:49:16,514
-Really?

1001
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:17,615
-Mm-hmm.

1002
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:19,717
-That was fast.

1003
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:21,891
-Did I do good or what?

1004
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,528
-What's he like?
Is he handsome?

1005
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:26,129
What did Cynthia say about him?

1006
00:49:26,134 --> 00:49:28,805
-Um, that he's got a lot
in common with you.

1007
00:49:28,806 --> 00:49:32,946
He's got a job at the bank --
at Cynthia's bank.

1008
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:34,277
He's a banker.

1009
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:36,654
-When are we gonna go out?
-I don't know.

1010
00:49:36,655 --> 00:49:39,359
When do you want me to have
Cynthia tell him you're free?

1011
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,296
-Any night.
It doesn't matter.

1012
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:43,167
-Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

1013
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:47,208
It's a first date,
so let's take it slow.

1014
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:48,678
-I guess I'll keep the dress
after all.

1015
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:51,749
You know, just so I have
something to wear.

1016
00:49:51,752 --> 00:49:53,192
-Okay.

1017
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:56,433
-I bet he's handsome.

1018
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:01,604
Bankers are always handsome.

1019
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:05,044
-I want you to give me

1020
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,514
Bianca's little sister's
phone number.

1021
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:08,785
I want to call her.
Today.

1022
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:10,354
-Jane?

1023
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:12,925
-Does she have other sisters?

1024
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,496
-How do you even know Jane?

1025
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:17,235
-I met her here the other night
and then at the party.

1026
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:19,706
-You talked to her?
-Yeah, I talked to her.

1027
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,208
-And?

1028
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,515
- She's interesting.

1029
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:27,756
-You notice anything a bit, uh,
different about her?

1030
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:29,927
-Yeah.
Like I said, she's interesting.

1031
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:32,528
She's -- she's shy,
she's awkward, even,

1032
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:34,035
but in a fucking cute way.

1033
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:35,906
-Does Bianca know about this?

1034
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,307
-That we met?
Yeah, she told me to stay away.

1035
00:50:38,308 --> 00:50:39,747
-You should probably
listen to her, then.

1036
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:41,449
You know how she can get.
-Fuck that noise.

1037
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,988
If Jane told you
to stay away from Bianca,

1038
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:45,589
would you have listened?

1039
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,428
-That's not --
that's not the same thing, man.

1040
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:49,165
-All I'm asking for
is her number.

1041
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:50,434
Obviously, I can't go to Bianca.

1042
00:50:50,435 --> 00:50:51,835
-I can't do that, Jack.

1043
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,538
I can't go behind her
back, especially not now.

1044
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:56,313
-Why not?
Living together not, uh --

1045
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:57,783
not working out?
-No, no, no.

1046
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:59,252
That's, um...

1047
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:01,691
That's not it.

1048
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,702
-What is it?

1049
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:11,342
-I was just offered a position
as a foreign correspondent.

1050
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:12,846
-You mean like real-deal
type of thing?

1051
00:51:12,847 --> 00:51:16,417
-Yeah, going to other countries,
flying in helicopters,

1052
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,290
interviewing diplomats,
getting shot at --

1053
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,327
all that good shit.

1054
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,564
-This is good, right?

1055
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:23,265
-Yeah, it's -- it's great.

1056
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:24,867
I mean, I know.
I know.

1057
00:51:24,868 --> 00:51:26,807
I'm gonna be
a real journalist -- I know --

1058
00:51:26,808 --> 00:51:28,410
and report on things
that actually matter.

1059
00:51:28,411 --> 00:51:29,980
-Did you tell Bianca?

1060
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:32,218
-Now's not the best time.
She's got opening this weekend.

1061
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:33,721
She's been
stressed out lately as is.

1062
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:34,957
-You got to tell her, man.
-No, I'm gonna tell her.

1063
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:35,959
I just found out an hour ago.

1064
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,360
Give me a break.

1065
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:39,633
-Which way are you leaning?

1066
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:41,069
-Which way am I leaning?
What do you think?

1067
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,606
I'm gonna take it.
Of course I'm gonna take it.

1068
00:51:42,607 --> 00:51:43,641
They're gonna put me
on the front lines.

1069
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,910
Of course I am gonna take it.

1070
00:51:44,911 --> 00:51:46,947
She can't expect me
not to take it.

1071
00:51:46,948 --> 00:51:48,788
- Cheers.

1072
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,530
-So, listen,
if you give me Jane's number,

1073
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,134
Bianca will be none the wiser.

1074
00:51:57,135 --> 00:51:59,640
If she ever finds out, I can
just say Jane gave it to me.

1075
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:01,276
-What?
Bianca won't believe that.

1076
00:52:01,277 --> 00:52:03,080
-Why not?
-Because Jane wouldn't do that.

1077
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,550
Jesus Christ, man.
What?

1078
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:05,885
You're putting me
in a pickle here, man.

1079
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:07,789
-Dude, you're, like sweating.
Calm down.

1080
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,526
-Calm down?
You're expecting me to trust you

1081
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,496
with my future sister-in-law,
and I'm sorry, Jack.

1082
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:12,498
I just -- I can't do that.

1083
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:14,268
-Why not?
-W-why not?

1084
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,471
Are you kidding me?
You serious?

1085
00:52:15,472 --> 00:52:17,108
Last night,
you were with, um, what?

1086
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:19,278
Fordham? Kim? The week before
that, you were with Christy.

1087
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:20,615
-How many women
did you fuck over

1088
00:52:20,616 --> 00:52:23,486
before you met the right one,
rob? Huh?

1089
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:25,858
And don't bother lying,
because I know.

1090
00:52:28,464 --> 00:52:32,138
Dude, Jane and I...

1091
00:52:32,139 --> 00:52:33,369
Had something, man.

1092
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:35,110
We did.

1093
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,851
She said I was cool.

1094
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:48,668
-You have to understand
what you're dealing with, Jack.

1095
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,775
She's not like other girls.

1096
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,276
-I know.
I already said that.

1097
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:53,681
-Not in the way that you think.

1098
00:52:53,682 --> 00:52:55,150
She doesn't have
all the bats in the belfry,

1099
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:56,554
if you get me.

1100
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:58,423
-You mean she's crazy?
-No, she's not crazy.

1101
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:00,027
She -- she lives
with her parents.

1102
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:03,568
She spends a lot of time
watching movies and sewing.

1103
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:04,736
She has social issues.

1104
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:06,306
-What's the problem?
Phobias?

1105
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:08,507
Ocd?
Stuff like that?

1106
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:10,422
-She has asperger's.

1107
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:19,272
Like rain man.
-I know what it is.

1108
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,815
Why --

1109
00:53:27,817 --> 00:53:30,417
Why have you never
talked to me about this, man?

1110
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:32,124
I didn't even know
that Bianca had a sister.

1111
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,830
-Why would I talk to you about
my girlfriend's retarded sister?

1112
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:37,001
-Jesus, man.
Don't talk about her like that.

1113
00:53:37,002 --> 00:53:39,338
-Oh, come on. Jesus Christ.
You sound just like Bianca.

1114
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:41,309
I am cutting to the chase, man.

1115
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,614
I like Jane a lot.
We play chess.

1116
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:46,854
She reads my articles --
all of them.

1117
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:49,955
But sometimes, man,
she is like a robot.

1118
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:52,971
And I mean that
as lovingly as possible.

1119
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:57,138
-So...

1120
00:53:57,142 --> 00:54:00,682
You still want that number?

1121
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:02,251
<i>-It's a matter of principle,</i>
<i>Mr. Harris.</i>

1122
00:54:02,252 --> 00:54:04,455
<i>I just don't like anybody</i>

00:54:16,848 --> 00:54:19,318

00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,689
but it's just the way I am.

1130
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:26,065
Even when I was a kid, I was
always the one asking questions.

1131
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,671
You know, if I was smart,
I'd find myself another date

1132
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:31,142
and forget all about you.

1133
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:34,115
-Sweetie, it's pretty late.

1134
00:54:34,116 --> 00:54:35,618
You might want
to turn the movie down.

1135
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:38,624
-I can't.
I'm practicing.

1136
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,985
<i>-I'm no fool, Pete.</i>

1137
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,897
-Well, just try not to wake
Mrs. Peterson.

1138
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:43,466
She'll never let me hear
the end of it.

1139
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:45,505
-After this week,
you'll never see her again.

1140
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:48,036
So who cares?!

1142
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:53,586

00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,118

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,962

Where are you?

1150
00:55:18,538 --> 00:55:21,738
Come on.
I need the fucking rib eye. -Sorry. I'm sorry. All right.

1151
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:29,559
-Good job tonight, guys.

1152
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,230
-Yeah, José carried my ass.

1153
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:37,642
-I just wanted to say thanks
again for the other night.

1154
00:55:37,643 --> 00:55:39,345
-My pleasure, man.
Glad I could help.

1155
00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:41,215
-Hey.
-Whoa.

1156
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:42,346

00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:43,654
-Okay.
<i>Gracias.</i>

1158
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:45,885
See you. Goodnight, Mr. gyp.

<i>-Mañana.</i>

1160
00:55:51,236 --> 00:55:55,006
You wouldn't mind if I put it
on special for a few weeks?

1161
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:57,581
Like last time?

1162
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,151
-I mean...

1163
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:01,489
I'd have to teach José

1164
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:05,060
how to whip it up
on my off days.

1165
00:56:05,064 --> 00:56:06,967
-That'd be great.

1166
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:10,368
You know,
i knew you were one of a kind

1167
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:13,581
when you first shuffled in here
six years ago.

1168
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:16,587
I knew it then,
and I know it now.

1169
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:19,225
Hang on to the good ones.

1170
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:20,595
Keep up the good work, Jackie.

1171
00:56:20,596 --> 00:56:22,426
I owe you one.

1172
00:56:22,432 --> 00:56:24,502
Big iou.

1173
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,549
-Gyp.

1174
00:56:32,953 --> 00:56:37,227
That's the last time, right?

1175
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,768
-Right.

1176
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:48,282
-I've been making a lot
of soups lately.

1177
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:50,988
-Soups?

1178
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:53,026
-Soups.

1179
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:55,597
Bisques, chowders --
you name it.

1180
00:56:55,598 --> 00:56:59,906
Soups are my achilles heel, man.
I just don't get them.

1181
00:56:59,907 --> 00:57:02,707
So I'm sort of challenging
myself.

1182
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,020
They're elusive.
-Mm-hmm.

1183
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:10,491
-They have less rules to them.

1184
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,832
I mean, think spaghetti,
for example.

1185
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,501
You drop it in,
you come back 15 minutes --

1186
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:16,740
that's just cooked.
Easy-peasy.

1187
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:18,209
But soups?

1188
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,050
Fuck.

1189
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:25,891
I really
want to be able to do soup,

1190
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:27,829
'cause there's nothing better
than a good soup.

1191
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,064
Nothing.

1192
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:30,995
- Come on.
- No.

1193
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:32,839
Come on, dude.
Hear me out.

1194
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,375
They are wild cards.
-Okay.

1195
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:35,644
-There are no rules.
-Okay.

1196
00:57:35,645 --> 00:57:37,080
-I mean, sure. You --
you can follow

1197
00:57:37,081 --> 00:57:39,284
a recipe, exact measurements
and all, you know?

1198
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:41,585
But you follow that,
and the food's for shit.

1199
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,128
A good soup.

1200
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:46,098
I don't know.

1201
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:48,804
You just got to be brave,
jump in there,

1202
00:57:48,805 --> 00:57:50,935
follow your instincts, you know?

1203
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:53,881
And you got to pay attention
to it.

1204
00:57:53,882 --> 00:57:55,985
You got to keep trying it
and tasting it along the way,

1205
00:57:55,986 --> 00:57:58,586
adding everything it needs.

1206
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:02,061
That's a lot of responsibility.

1207
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:05,470
Takes more time.
It's more delicate.

1208
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:09,378
And, frankly, man,
that fucking terrifies me.

1209
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:12,649
Can't stay focused
on one dish that long.

1210
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,754
I mean, you know
what it's like in there

1211
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:15,055
when the shit hits the fan.

1212
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:16,125
You got like 40 tickets
in your face.

1213
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:18,095
You just churn the dishes out.

1214
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:22,936
But soup...

1215
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,809
Fuck.

1216
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,880
I want to have that
in my arsenal, you know?

1217
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,255
-You really like soups, huh?

1218
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:32,386
-Kim, hold on.

1219
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:33,727
Slow down.
- Wait.

1220
00:58:33,728 --> 00:58:36,465
Where do you live?
-Right around the corner.

1221
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:37,796
-Oh, god.
-Come on.

1222
00:58:37,803 --> 00:58:39,943
-I think Jack saw us.

1223
00:58:45,585 --> 00:58:46,715
-José

1224
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:47,961
<i>-dime.</i>

1225
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,863
-Am I an asshole?

1226
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:53,904
Tell me honestly.

1227
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:59,378
-Nah.

1228
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,219
You're a funny man.

1229
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:05,857
-Good.

1230
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:06,860
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

1231
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:08,771
<i>-Buenas noches.</i>

1232
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,388
-You, uh, sure
you don't want me to come?

1233
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:24,428
-I already told you
i can do this on my own.

1234
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:25,669
-Okay.

1235
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,436
And you know where you're going?

1236
00:59:28,437 --> 00:59:31,275
-Yes.
I wrote it down.

1237
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,776
-Oh, do you want
me to do your makeup, or --

1238
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:36,886
-no, makeup
is false advertising.

1239
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:39,224
-What about
just a little mascara?

1240
00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:41,295
-Okay.
Maybe just a touch.

1241
00:59:42,465 --> 00:59:44,334
And you're sure
you don't want me to come?

1242
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:46,205
-Bianca.
-Okay.

1243
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:47,642
-See you later.
Have a nice night.

1244
00:59:47,643 --> 00:59:49,646
Thanks again.

1245
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,996
-We're closing soon, sir.

1246
00:59:58,998 --> 01:00:00,998
-I'm almost finished.

1247
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:05,405
What?

1248
01:00:05,411 --> 01:00:07,848
-Maybe you want to buy it.

1249
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:12,219
-See, this is why people
go to Barnes &amp; Noble.

1250
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:23,611
-Sorry I was late.

1251
01:00:23,614 --> 01:00:25,517
The traffic was a nightmare.

1252
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:27,118
-You have a car?
-No.

1253
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,222
I don't know
why I just said that.

1254
01:00:28,223 --> 01:00:29,859
I walked.
-Oh, it's okay.

1255
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,430
I only waited about a half hour.

1256
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:35,441
-You must've been early, then.
I thought we said 8:30.

1257
01:00:42,284 --> 01:00:44,622
I don't go out to dinner much.

1258
01:00:44,623 --> 01:00:48,229
- You ordered
the wine very nicely.

1259
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:50,266
-Malbec was the only one
i could pronounce.

1260
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:53,137
- So you like red?

1261
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,544
-No, I prefer white.

1262
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:56,745
-Malbec is a red, though.

1263
01:00:56,747 --> 01:00:58,047
My dad drinks it a lot.

1264
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:01,488
-Should we order something else?

1265
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:03,289
It's too late now.

1266
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:10,006
I'm sorry I was late.
It's kind of thrown the whole thing off.

1267
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:13,109
I was only late
because I wasn't sure

1268
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:15,283
if I was going to come tonight.

1269
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:19,891
Took me a long time
to leave the house.

1270
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:23,373
-I'm glad you did.
-I am, too.

1271
01:01:25,137 --> 01:01:27,807
You're so pretty.
I can't believe my luck.

1272
01:01:27,808 --> 01:01:29,377
This type of thing
isn't supposed to happen

1273
01:01:29,378 --> 01:01:31,518
to a guy who still lives
with his mom.

1274
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:36,787
-What do you like to do, Steven?

1275
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,663
-A whole bunch of stuff.

1276
01:01:38,664 --> 01:01:41,068
-Like what?

1277
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:44,879
-Making models
out of balsa wood.

1278
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:50,453
-I'm a builder of sorts, myself.
I mean, I want to be.

1279
01:01:50,454 --> 01:01:53,560
I used to make all my sister's
costumes for the school plays.

1280
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:55,296
Now I work
in the costume department.

1281
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:57,033
They don't let me
design the costumes yet,

1282
01:01:57,034 --> 01:01:58,402
but I'm working
on this really fancy dress.

1283
01:01:58,403 --> 01:02:01,008
-I'll show you my models.
I like showing them off.

1284
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,678
My place isn't too far away.

1285
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:04,782
That's why I had
you meet me here for dinner.

1286
01:02:04,783 --> 01:02:06,251
-Maybe not tonight.

1287
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:08,857
-I create exact replicas
of the wonders of the world.

1288
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,058
Not to scale, of course.

1289
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:17,035
-Don't move.
Stay exactly where you are.

1290
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:20,521
-Oh, just let it ring.
-It could be the realtor.

1291
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:24,187
Yeah? Phil here.

1292
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:27,858
-Hello.
Uh, may I please speak to Jane?

1293
01:02:27,862 --> 01:02:29,865
-Who? Jane?

1294
01:02:29,866 --> 01:02:31,466
-Y-yes, Jane.

1295
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:34,709
-No. No, no.
Jane's out on a date.

1296
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,579
-She's on a date.
-Yeah.

1297
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,980
A date.

1298
01:02:37,983 --> 01:02:40,286
-Okay.

1299
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:42,758
Uh, well, would you --
would you mind taking a message?

1300
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,897
-I-i-i don't have a pen handy.

1301
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:48,468
-Okay, that's fine.

1302
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:51,308
-Your spot's getting cold,
Philly steak!

1303
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:55,149
Hush, margo.

1304
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,654
-Listen, kid,
could you call back tomorrow?

1305
01:02:57,655 --> 01:02:59,224
I'm a little busy right now.

1306
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:01,829
-Yeah, sure. Yeah, would --
would you just please, uh,

1307
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:03,232
let her know that Jack called.

1308
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:05,302
-Sure, sure.
I'll tell her that Zack called.

1309
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:06,973
Bye, now.
-Actually, it's --

1310
01:03:13,386 --> 01:03:15,456
-There's really nothing
quite like boating --

1311
01:03:15,457 --> 01:03:20,697
feeling the wind in your cheeks,
unfurling the sail.

1312
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:22,538
Do you boat?

1313
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:24,875
-No, I've been on a boat,
though.

1314
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:26,306
I like the water.

1315
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:27,714
I've taken the ferry
to staten island

1316
01:03:27,715 --> 01:03:29,518
so I can look at the statue.
-It's funny.

1317
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:31,789
Cynthia told me nothing
about you, and what do you know?

1318
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,227
We have so much in common.

1319
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:37,128
-What do you mean,
nothing about me?

1320
01:03:37,134 --> 01:03:40,444
-Just that, you know,
you were lonely.

1321
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:45,684
-I'm not lonely.
-It's okay.

1322
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:47,315
So am I.

1323
01:03:47,316 --> 01:03:48,523
-What are you talking about?

1324
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,128
I have friends.

1325
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:52,296
-I'm getting very uncomfortable.

1326
01:03:52,297 --> 01:03:53,867
You're -- you're upset.

1327
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:58,242
-What else did Cynthia
say about me?

1328
01:03:58,243 --> 01:04:00,914
She said you were like me.

1329
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:02,945
-I'm nothing like you.

1330
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,955
You're nothing like me!

1331
01:04:08,697 --> 01:04:10,934
-I don't like being alone,
either.

1332
01:04:10,935 --> 01:04:12,604
Sometimes, but not all the time.

1333
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:22,456
-Jane, everybody's --
-no!

1334
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:24,327
I-i have to go now.
-Go where?

1335
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:25,928
The bathroom?
-I'm sorry.

1336
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:27,200
This was just so stupid.
-What did I do?

1337
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,235
-No, no, no, no!
Don't come near me!

1338
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:29,466
-Hey!
Be careful.

1339
01:04:29,467 --> 01:04:31,141
-It's okay.
This happens to me t--

1340
01:04:31,142 --> 01:04:33,312
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1341
01:04:33,313 --> 01:04:34,982
-Ma'am, please calm down.
-Jane.

1342
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:37,521
-Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

1343
01:04:37,522 --> 01:04:38,923
-Don't make a scene.
It's okay.

1344
01:04:38,924 --> 01:04:40,292
-This was so stupid!

1345
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,363
I hate you!
This was so stupid!

1346
01:04:42,364 --> 01:04:44,668
-Listen to me, Jane.
Everything's fine.

1347
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:46,371
Everything -- breathe.
Do your breathing.

1348
01:04:46,372 --> 01:04:47,741
I got you.
I'm here, okay?

1349
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:49,578
We're gonna leave now.
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

1350
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:51,849
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

1351
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:52,985
Cynthia, do you got that?
-Got it.

1352
01:04:52,986 --> 01:04:55,516
-Jane! Jane!

1353
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,159
Jane!
-Whoa. Careful.

1354
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,397
-Jane, don't do this.

1355
01:04:59,398 --> 01:05:02,604
Jane, come back here.

1356
01:05:16,399 --> 01:05:19,269
Damn it, Jane.
I'm wearing heels.

1357
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:21,241
Jane, please stop!
Come on.

1358
01:05:21,242 --> 01:05:23,452
I'm getting a serious cramp.

1359
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:35,837
-Were you spying on me?

1360
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:37,268
-No, I wasn't spying on you.

1361
01:05:37,269 --> 01:05:39,177
I was trying to make sure
everything went well.

1362
01:05:39,178 --> 01:05:41,878
-What's wrong with you?

1363
01:05:41,883 --> 01:05:43,051
I told you not to come.

1364
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:44,253
I told you I could handle it,

1365
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:45,790
and you spied on me.

1366
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,126
-All right, I spied on you

1367
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:48,830
and you asked me not to
and I'm sorry,

1368
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:50,331
but, Jane, come on.

1369
01:05:50,332 --> 01:05:52,704
That wasn't exactly handling it.
-I just wanted to go,

1370
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:55,175
and everybody kept trying
to put their hands on me.

1371
01:05:55,176 --> 01:05:57,346
-They were trying
to calm you down!

1372
01:05:57,347 --> 01:05:59,384
Jesus!
I knew this would happen!

1373
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:02,185
It's not my fault!

1374
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:08,566
He didn't ask
a single thing about me.

1375
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:10,272
He ordered for me,
and I didn't even

1376
01:06:10,273 --> 01:06:12,476
tell him what I wanted.

1377
01:06:12,477 --> 01:06:15,377
And Cynthia didn't tell him
anything about me.

1378
01:06:15,378 --> 01:06:16,484
-What are you talking about,
Jane?

1379
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:18,054
I'm sure that she did.

1380
01:06:18,055 --> 01:06:20,755
-All she said was
that I was lonely

1381
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:24,434
and that I was just like him.
-She didn't say that.

1382
01:06:24,435 --> 01:06:26,772
She just meant that you guys
would have something in common.

1383
01:06:26,773 --> 01:06:28,583
-Based on what?

1384
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,886
You only set me up with Steven
because he's lonely

1385
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:37,827
and a little slow
and he would accept anyone.

1386
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,240
That's what you thought we would
have in common, isn't it?

1387
01:06:46,713 --> 01:06:49,083
Don't even say anything.

1388
01:06:49,084 --> 01:06:51,087
It'll be just another
stupid apology

1389
01:06:51,088 --> 01:06:52,557
like the one you gave me
when you said

1390
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:55,728
you didn't want me to move in.

1391
01:06:55,731 --> 01:06:58,836
You didn't even want me to come
to your stupid party, either.

1392
01:06:58,837 --> 01:07:00,267
I could tell.

1393
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,575
And you know what?

1394
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:03,646
I didn't even want to be there!

1395
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:07,587
It's like you want to forget
i exist or something!

1396
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:11,728
Maybe you should just forget
i asked you for anything ever!

1397
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,668
You only let me down!
-Okay, okay, okay.

1398
01:07:14,669 --> 01:07:17,369
So we set you up with Steven
because he's slow.

1399
01:07:17,374 --> 01:07:19,511
And you're right, Jane.
I'm an asshole.

1400
01:07:19,512 --> 01:07:21,549
Is that what you
need to hear right now?

1401
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:22,584
-No!

1402
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:24,153
-Listen to me, Jane.
Listen to me.

1403
01:07:24,154 --> 01:07:26,224
I'm so sorry
that happened tonight.

1404
01:07:26,225 --> 01:07:28,825
I really am.
I just...

1405
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,835
Life isn't always like it is
in the movies that you watch.

1406
01:07:31,836 --> 01:07:33,366
-No, it has to be.

1407
01:07:33,372 --> 01:07:35,208
It has to be or else
they wouldn't

1408
01:07:35,209 --> 01:07:37,346
have made those movies
to begin with.

1409
01:07:37,347 --> 01:07:38,677
Move!

1410
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:41,922
-Jane!
Jane, where are you gonna go?

1411
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:06,371
Get out of the way!

1412
01:08:08,275 --> 01:08:11,245
-Come on, miss!
What are you doing?!

1413
01:08:11,248 --> 01:08:12,848
Unreal.

1414
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,887
- Hey, babe.

1415
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:32,188
How'd she do?

1416
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,765
Oh.

1417
01:08:36,766 --> 01:08:39,166
That good, huh?

1418
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:40,541
-Yeah.

1419
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:44,477
I'm gonna take a shower.

1420
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:51,527
-Hey, I ran into Paul yesterday.

1421
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:54,066
Do you remember Paul?

1422
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:55,937
-Paul?
-Yeah, he's, um --

1423
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:58,608
he's my buddy from work.

1424
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:03,520
Turns out he's got
a brother with autism.

1425
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:08,361
-What?

1426
01:09:08,362 --> 01:09:11,300
-Rob,
it did not go well tonight.

1427
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:14,371
At all.

1428
01:09:14,374 --> 01:09:17,379
-Okay.
We will figure it out.

1429
01:09:19,852 --> 01:09:23,458
It's a farmhouse
in the middle of nowhere.

1430
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,229
-Uh, well, I don't know.

1431
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:28,501
Maybe she'll get a horse.

1432
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:32,877
-Yeah, or maybe she'll just
sit inside all day

1433
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:37,518
and stay on the fast track to
becoming some old spinster aunt.

1434
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:45,870
Babe, what's going on with you?
What are you working on?

1435
01:09:45,871 --> 01:09:47,740
-Um...

1436
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:51,347
Yeah.

1437
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:52,784
There is something
i need to tell you.

1438
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:54,921
It's probably not
the best timing in the world,

1439
01:09:54,922 --> 01:09:56,190
but...

1440
01:09:56,191 --> 01:09:57,961
-What is it?

1441
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:05,408
-Mine ear, I thank it,
brought me to that sound.

1442
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:07,814
But why unkindly didst thou
leave me so?

1443
01:10:07,815 --> 01:10:11,045
-Why should he stay,
whom love doth press to go?

1444
01:10:11,054 --> 01:10:13,458
-What love could press lysander
from my side?

1445
01:10:16,265 --> 01:10:19,835
-What the fuck was that?!

1446
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:21,675
Turn it off.

1447
01:10:27,588 --> 01:10:29,658
<i>-What are you doing here?</i>
<i>-Simple.</i>

1448
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:31,828
<i>I came looking for you.</i>
-I'm coming.

1449
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:33,029
I'm coming.

1450
01:10:33,032 --> 01:10:35,536
Hello?

1451
01:10:35,537 --> 01:10:37,907
Hey, ma, what is it?

1452
01:10:37,908 --> 01:10:41,247
Bianca, sweetie, thank you
for calling me back for once.

1453
01:10:41,248 --> 01:10:42,517
-Well, you just blew up my phone

1454
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:44,554
in the middle of rehearsal,
so...

1455
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:46,785
-Oh, i-i knew
you were preparing.

1456
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:49,029
I had no idea
you were still rehearsing.

1457
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:52,637
-Well, I am, so maybe next time
send me a text or --

1458
01:10:52,638 --> 01:10:54,838
-but doesn't the show
open tonight?

1459
01:10:54,842 --> 01:10:57,012
-Yeah, just going over
a few things.

1460
01:10:57,013 --> 01:10:59,918
Mm. You must be so excited.

1461
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:01,249
-Psyched.

1462
01:11:01,254 --> 01:11:03,458
- Well...

1463
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,929
I wanted to talk to you
about Jane.

1464
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:08,468
-What do -- what do you mean?

1465
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:11,908
-Just, um, you know, last night,

1466
01:11:11,909 --> 01:11:15,015
um, she was so excited
about her date...

1467
01:11:15,016 --> 01:11:17,285
<i>-... and forget all about you.</i>

1468
01:11:17,286 --> 01:11:21,086
<i>Only I can't help feeling</i>
<i>you're in trouble.</i>

1469
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,663
<i>-I liked it better</i>
<i>this afternoon</i>

1470
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:24,701
<i>when you stopped asking</i>
<i>questions.</i>

1471
01:11:24,702 --> 01:11:27,139
-And then this morning
she wakes up,

1472
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:30,910
and she starts watching "Kansas
city confidential" again.

1473
01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:32,149
Like twice.

1474
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,790
I mean, right now,
she's on her third viewing.

1475
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,494
-Did she say anything, or...

1476
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,995
-No, just that it was good.

1477
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:46,845
So -- so you think
it's just one of her moods?

1478
01:11:46,846 --> 01:11:49,476
-Yeah, exactly, mom.
It's just one of her moods.

1479
01:11:49,484 --> 01:11:51,955
-Okay, um, well,

1480
01:11:51,956 --> 01:11:55,256
we're so excited
for you about tonight.

1481
01:11:55,262 --> 01:11:57,399
I wish you'd let us come though.

1482
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,671
-Mom, you know I don't like
you guys at opening night.

1483
01:11:59,672 --> 01:12:02,642
I get nervous enough
with strangers, and...

1484
01:12:02,644 --> 01:12:03,979
I got to go, mom.

1485
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,914
There's my cue.

1486
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:06,915
-Oh, your cue.
Okay.

1487
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:07,820
I'll let you go.

1488
01:12:07,821 --> 01:12:09,456
-Okay, bye.
-Bye, sweetie.

1489
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:10,657
I...

1490
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:11,862
<i>-Forget it.</i>
-... love you.

1491
01:12:11,863 --> 01:12:14,003
<i>-Mind your own business.</i>

1492
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:18,407
- Uh, Harrison,
i-I'm so sorry about that.

1493
01:12:18,408 --> 01:12:22,078
I thought it was on silent.
It won't happen again.

1494
01:12:24,154 --> 01:12:26,357
-I would hope not.

1495
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:28,494
We open in six hours.

1496
01:12:28,495 --> 01:12:29,925
-Yeah.

1497
01:12:31,903 --> 01:12:36,076
-Do you know how many times
i almost fired you?

1498
01:12:36,077 --> 01:12:37,145
Twice.

1499
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:38,815
The phone ringing
would've been a third,

1500
01:12:38,816 --> 01:12:42,216
but it's too late
to fire you now.

1501
01:12:44,294 --> 01:12:47,567
Why do you still have that?

1502
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:49,269
-These are my --
my notes and my objectives,

1503
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:51,740
and we will --
-screw your objectives!

1504
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,277
It's opening night!

1505
01:12:53,278 --> 01:12:57,518
That's a fucking
security blanket, titania.

1506
01:12:57,521 --> 01:13:00,058
Right now,
you're working too hard

1507
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:03,464
on trying to control
everything around you

1508
01:13:03,465 --> 01:13:06,635
to make sure this fucking thing
goes perfectly.

1509
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:09,877
The fact that you still
have this

1510
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:12,178
shows me

1511
01:13:12,183 --> 01:13:15,656
You have no trust
in the people around you.

1512
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:19,564
I need you to get up there

1513
01:13:19,565 --> 01:13:22,035
and leave all your notes,
objectives,

1514
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:28,946
and your personal shit
off stage.

1515
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,350
Let go.

1516
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:32,389
You think you could do that?

1517
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,359
Just once?

1518
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,631
- Phil, will you get it, please?

1519
01:13:36,632 --> 01:13:37,767
It might be the realtor.

1520
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:41,808
-I'm already getting it!
Christ.

1521
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:43,209
-Morning. Phil speaking.

1522
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,981
-Morning. Is Jane around?
I'd love to speak to her.

1523
01:13:44,982 --> 01:13:48,254
-Uh, yeah, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

1524
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:51,555
Janey, another fish
on the line for ya.

1525
01:13:51,562 --> 01:13:53,331
This one sounds
like a real catch.

1526
01:13:53,332 --> 01:13:56,437
-Dad, I haven't even
brushed my teeth yet.

1527
01:13:56,438 --> 01:13:57,538
-He doesn't know that.

1528
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,476
Should I tell him to call back?

1529
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,547
-Is his name Steven?

1530
01:14:01,549 --> 01:14:04,186
-Hey, is your name Steven?
-No.

1531
01:14:04,187 --> 01:14:07,487
-Negative.

1532
01:14:07,493 --> 01:14:09,303
-Give it here and go away.

1533
01:14:14,307 --> 01:14:16,076
Hello?

1534
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,445
-Hi.

1535
01:14:17,446 --> 01:14:18,676
Jane?
-Yes.

1536
01:14:18,683 --> 01:14:20,886
And who's this?
-Jack.

1537
01:14:20,887 --> 01:14:23,290
We, uh -- we met
at Bianca's housewarming party

1538
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,292
on Monday.

1539
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,363
-Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1540
01:14:31,408 --> 01:14:34,478
-I'm sorry. What did you say
your name was again?

1541
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,690
♪♪

1542
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:44,600
-So, uh, you're the fella
that called last night.

1543
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,704
-Yeah.

it was something that you said

1719
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:40,015
on the roof the other night.

1720
01:24:40,024 --> 01:24:43,162
You said, "i don't get
you neurotypicals."

1721
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:44,398
I looked it up that night,

1722
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:46,135
and I've been reading this book.

1723
01:24:48,742 --> 01:24:51,012
Okay.

1724
01:24:51,013 --> 01:24:54,519
To be honest, rob mentioned it
when I asked for your number,

1725
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,888
but I knew before that.

1726
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:57,925
I mean, i-i couldn't
tell that you were --

1727
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,026
-you must think
I'm some big weirdo.

1728
01:25:01,033 --> 01:25:05,473
-No, I didn't mean it like that.

1729
01:25:05,474 --> 01:25:06,677
There is nothing
wrong with you.

1730
01:25:06,678 --> 01:25:09,048
I like you the way that you are.

1731
01:25:09,049 --> 01:25:11,789
I really, really do.

1732
01:25:13,892 --> 01:25:16,295
-Really?

1733
01:25:16,296 --> 01:25:17,596
-I swear.

1734
01:25:17,599 --> 01:25:20,705
-... vows, the hours
that we have spent

1735
01:25:20,706 --> 01:25:22,909
when we have chide
the hasty-footed time for parting us...

1736
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:29,889
-I was only reading that stuff
because I wanted to understand

1737
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:33,997
how you might feel,
how you might think.

1738
01:25:33,998 --> 01:25:38,468
I just didn't want
to do anything to mess this up.

1739
01:25:42,415 --> 01:25:45,855
-I don't want
to go back down there.

1740
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,426
-Where do you want to go?

1741
01:25:53,872 --> 01:25:58,112
-... so we grew together,
like a double cherry --

1742
01:25:58,113 --> 01:26:02,922
seeming parted
but yet an union in partition --

1743
01:26:02,923 --> 01:26:05,928
two lovely berries
molded on one stem.

1744
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:10,436
So, with two seeming bodies
but one heart,

1745
01:26:10,437 --> 01:26:12,837
two of the first,
like coats in heraldry...

1746
01:26:12,838 --> 01:26:14,478
-Let's go. Come on.
-What are you doing?

1747
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:15,981
-I don't have to go after them.
Come on.

1748
01:26:15,982 --> 01:26:18,921
-Jane can handle herself.
I'm sure she's fine. Don't move.

1749
01:26:18,922 --> 01:26:20,591
-Shh!

1750
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,127
-... and will you rent...

1751
01:26:22,128 --> 01:26:24,498
-She is not fine.
Serious.

1752
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:25,968
The plane has absolutely
crashed.

1753
01:26:25,969 --> 01:26:28,639
Bianca's gonna fucking kill me.
-Oh, my god.

1754
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:31,411
-Shut up!
-Sorry. Sorry. My wife.

1755
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:34,986
I'm gonna rip his dick off.
-Rob!

1756
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:36,957
-Shh!

1757
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,877
-Wow.
Look at this place.

1758
01:26:46,878 --> 01:26:49,616
Pretty cool, huh?

1759
01:26:49,617 --> 01:26:50,951
Why didn't you tell me
you worked here?

1760
01:26:50,952 --> 01:26:53,155
This is incredible.
Look at this stuff.

1761
01:26:53,156 --> 01:26:55,086
-I've patched most of these up.

1762
01:26:56,564 --> 01:27:00,103
You know, a lot of famous actors
wore these costumes.

1763
01:27:00,104 --> 01:27:02,274
-What about this one?
Did you patch this up?

1764
01:27:02,275 --> 01:27:04,075
-I had to fix the zipper.

1765
01:27:05,682 --> 01:27:07,685
Bianca won't mind
if we miss the end?

1766
01:27:07,686 --> 01:27:10,986
-I've seen it like 50 times.

1767
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:14,599
Jack!
-Yeah?

1768
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,304
-Stay here, and don't peek.

1769
01:27:17,305 --> 01:27:19,035
-Okay.

1770
01:27:24,118 --> 01:27:25,658
Ha!

1771
01:27:27,391 --> 01:27:29,261
You could get lost in here.

1772
01:27:29,262 --> 01:27:31,302
-No, you couldn't.

1773
01:27:41,186 --> 01:27:42,855
Hey!
Don't touch anything!

1774
01:27:42,856 --> 01:27:44,686
-Right. Sorry.

1775
01:27:45,829 --> 01:27:46,997
-I said...

1776
01:27:46,998 --> 01:27:50,368
Don't open your eyes!
-Right.

1777
01:27:50,371 --> 01:27:51,706
My bad.

1778
01:27:51,707 --> 01:27:54,577
-Are your eyes closed?
-Yes, they are.

1779
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,820
-I'm trusting you, Jack.

1780
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:09,011
-You can open them now.

1781
01:28:12,883 --> 01:28:14,786
How do I look?

1782
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:17,787
♪♪

1783
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:20,363
-Absolutely stunning.

1784
01:28:20,364 --> 01:28:23,202
-I made it myself.

1785
01:28:23,203 --> 01:28:24,872
I hid it
with all the other ones.

1786
01:28:24,873 --> 01:28:28,079
Nobody else has
seen me in it before.

1787
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,615
-Ah, man, that's what Bianca

1788
01:28:29,616 --> 01:28:31,485
should be wearing
out there tonight.

1789
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:33,055
-No, I made this one for me.

1790
01:28:33,056 --> 01:28:35,794
I was supposed to get rid of it,
but I didn't.

1791
01:28:35,795 --> 01:28:38,625
I added this fabric
from another throwaway

1792
01:28:38,634 --> 01:28:40,871
and all the beading
and the stitching.

1793
01:28:40,872 --> 01:28:45,246
Nobody else wanted it,
but look at it now.

1794
01:28:45,247 --> 01:28:47,585
I wanted you to see me in it

1795
01:28:47,586 --> 01:28:50,656
because it makes me feel
beautiful.

1796
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,395
-You are beautiful.

1797
01:28:53,396 --> 01:28:55,226
-Really?

1798
01:28:55,234 --> 01:28:57,074
-Yeah.

1799
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:03,547
-Just so you know...

1800
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:06,355
I wanted to tell you
about myself.

1801
01:29:06,356 --> 01:29:07,416
I did.

1802
01:29:07,424 --> 01:29:09,662
I don't want to lie to you.

1803
01:29:09,663 --> 01:29:11,666
I was gonna tell you on the roof
that night

1804
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:14,137
before Bianca stuck
her fat head in.

1805
01:29:15,575 --> 01:29:19,645
I was just worried
you weren't gonna like me.

1806
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,955
There was a boy
who wanted to kiss me once,

1807
01:29:22,956 --> 01:29:25,126
and then all of his friends
told him about me,

1808
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:29,234
and he didn't want
to kiss me after that.

1809
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:31,805
-I already told you I like you.

1810
01:29:31,807 --> 01:29:35,714
-He said the same thing,
but he was lying.

1811
01:29:35,715 --> 01:29:40,155
-Well, I am not that boy.

1812
01:29:43,139 --> 01:29:45,567
-Are you about to kiss me?

1813
01:29:45,568 --> 01:29:46,968
-Am I allowed to?

1814
01:29:46,971 --> 01:29:50,309
-I would like that very much.

1815
01:30:02,334 --> 01:30:03,670
-Oh!

1816
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:08,045
Bianca, you were on fire
out there tonight.

1817
01:30:08,046 --> 01:30:10,016
-Let's see
how the next one goes, shall we?

1818
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:12,587
-Hmm.
What did I tell you?

1819
01:30:12,589 --> 01:30:13,989
I'm never wrong.

1820
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:17,130
All right, people,
let's get fucked up!

1821
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:19,100
Ha! Ha-ha-ha!

1822
01:30:19,101 --> 01:30:23,611
Oh, you, sir,
were absolutely fantastic.

1823
01:30:24,206 --> 01:30:27,785
-Why did she want
to meet back here?

1824
01:30:27,786 --> 01:30:29,386
Everybody else is out front.

1825
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:31,358
-It's the perfect place
to put a bullet in my head.

1826
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,259
-Oh, would you calm down?

1827
01:30:35,902 --> 01:30:38,312
I need those.

1828
01:30:39,743 --> 01:30:42,053
- Jane?

1829
01:30:54,472 --> 01:30:56,776
-Did you like my father?

1830
01:30:56,777 --> 01:30:58,977
-I -- I liked him
very much, yeah.

1831
01:30:58,981 --> 01:31:01,586
He had a weary eye for me,
but I liked him.

1832
01:31:01,587 --> 01:31:02,755
He liked me, I think.

1833
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:04,224
-I think he thinks
you're handsome.

1834
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:08,025
- Okay.

1835
01:31:08,032 --> 01:31:10,502
-How many seats
do you think there are?

1836
01:31:12,976 --> 01:31:15,376
-... fairies floating about,
granting wishes.

1837
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:18,650
Do you have any wishes
you need the fairies to Grant?

1838
01:31:18,654 --> 01:31:20,122
-I wish that we were

1839
01:31:20,123 --> 01:31:22,427
in a black-and-white movie
together.

1840
01:31:22,428 --> 01:31:27,805
-Wow. Well, you know, i-i
speak fairy fluently, actually.

1841
01:31:30,845 --> 01:31:33,081
I mean, I'm not incredibly
fluent, but I can do it.

1842
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:40,130
You have the most amazing laugh.

1843
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:45,874
-Bianca,
before you say anything,

1844
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,905
I gave Jack her number.

1845
01:31:47,912 --> 01:31:50,015
I know I made a huge mistake,

1846
01:31:50,016 --> 01:31:52,654
and I am very, very sorry.
I own it.

1847
01:31:52,655 --> 01:31:54,257
I swear I thought
it would make her happy.

1848
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:55,858
I just -- I wanted to...

1849
01:31:57,331 --> 01:31:58,600
...help.

1850
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:01,438
-Thank you.

1851
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:03,676
-You're welcome.

1852
01:32:03,677 --> 01:32:06,677
-I love you, babe.

1853
01:32:06,683 --> 01:32:11,491
-I love you, too,
with all of my heart.

1854
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,397
-And I'm proud of you --

1855
01:32:14,398 --> 01:32:16,898
like, big-time.

1856
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:18,640
-I'm proud of <i>you.</i>
-Mm?

1857
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:21,746
-Like insane-time.
You were...

1858
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:24,617
You were incredible up there.

1859
01:32:26,088 --> 01:32:27,323
-Cynthia's wanting --
wants to say something.

1860
01:32:27,324 --> 01:32:29,962
- I'm gonna get her.

1861
01:32:29,963 --> 01:32:31,966
Hey.
- Hey.

1862
01:32:31,967 --> 01:32:34,767
You were so awesome.

1863
01:32:34,773 --> 01:32:36,776
-Thank you. Thank --
-these are for you.

1864
01:32:36,777 --> 01:32:38,607
Mm.

1865
01:32:38,614 --> 01:32:41,217
-The cast is meeting
at that bar around the corner.

1866
01:32:41,218 --> 01:32:43,918
Uh, how about I meet you guys
there in about 10?

1867
01:32:43,924 --> 01:32:46,328
-What about Jane?

1868
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:50,299
-I don't think
we have to worry about Jane.

1869
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:52,273
-So what now?

1870
01:32:52,274 --> 01:32:54,845
-Uh, I guess, uh,

1871
01:32:54,846 --> 01:32:56,576
I put you in a car
and take you home.

1872
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:58,185
And then I'll see you tomorrow.

1873
01:32:58,186 --> 01:32:59,555
And then we could
start all over.

1874
01:32:59,556 --> 01:33:00,756
-Hey.

1875
01:33:00,758 --> 01:33:02,258
-Oh.

1876
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:06,234
-Relax.
I -- I come in peace.

1877
01:33:06,235 --> 01:33:09,235
-Shouldn't you be out
with the rest of the cast?

1878
01:33:09,241 --> 01:33:12,948
-I'm pretty sure they'll still
have fun without me.

1879
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:14,450
-Well,
if you're here to lecture me,

1880
01:33:14,451 --> 01:33:16,154
you should just go home.

1881
01:33:16,155 --> 01:33:17,655
I'm fine.

1882
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:19,329
-I know you are, Jane.

1883
01:33:21,432 --> 01:33:24,404
-Hey, Jack.

1884
01:33:24,405 --> 01:33:26,335
Did you guys enjoy the show?

1885
01:33:26,342 --> 01:33:27,811
-Yeah.

1886
01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:29,982
You really amazed me, Bianca.

1887
01:33:29,983 --> 01:33:31,384
I mean,
i always knew you were good.

1888
01:33:31,385 --> 01:33:33,785
I just -- I didn't know
you were that good.

1889
01:33:33,786 --> 01:33:35,092
You made me like Shakespeare.

1890
01:33:35,093 --> 01:33:37,731
That's huge.

1891
01:33:37,732 --> 01:33:38,832
-Awesome.

1892
01:33:38,834 --> 01:33:39,968
Thank you.

1893
01:33:39,969 --> 01:33:41,337
That really means a lot.

1894
01:33:41,338 --> 01:33:43,978
-Yeah, I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

1895
01:33:45,681 --> 01:33:48,385
-Do you mind if I just
have a minute with my sis?

1896
01:33:48,386 --> 01:33:52,056
I will give her right back.
I promise.

1897
01:33:54,164 --> 01:33:56,504
-It's okay.
She's telling the truth.

1898
01:33:58,473 --> 01:34:00,744
-Yeah, I'll just wait out front.

1899
01:34:00,745 --> 01:34:03,545
-Again, you were really killer.

1900
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:05,390
-Thanks.

1901
01:34:12,702 --> 01:34:15,205
Wow.

1902
01:34:15,206 --> 01:34:17,036
Where did you get that dress?

1903
01:34:17,043 --> 01:34:19,447
-From the costume department.

1904
01:34:19,448 --> 01:34:22,148
-I don't know
if you should be wearing that.

1905
01:34:22,154 --> 01:34:23,488
-Why not?

1906
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:25,959
I made it. Hmm.

1907
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:28,599
-You made that?

1908
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,739
-Yes, I did.

1909
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,710
-Wow.

1910
01:34:34,712 --> 01:34:36,882
You look so...

1911
01:34:36,883 --> 01:34:41,291
Grown-up and so beautiful.

1912
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:44,565
-You were really good tonight,
Bianca.

1913
01:34:44,566 --> 01:34:46,267
I'm sorry
i didn't watch the whole thing,

1914
01:34:46,268 --> 01:34:48,205
but I was there for most
of your dress rehearsals

1915
01:34:48,206 --> 01:34:49,641
and the regular rehearsals, too.

1916
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:51,512
-I know.
I know you were.

1917
01:34:51,513 --> 01:34:54,618
-And I only meant some
of the things I said last night.

1918
01:34:54,619 --> 01:34:55,687
Not all of them.

1919
01:34:55,688 --> 01:34:57,788
Only some of them.

1920
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,832
-Me, too.

1921
01:35:02,133 --> 01:35:04,343
-Are you mad at me about Jack?

1922
01:35:06,108 --> 01:35:09,078
-Not if he's nice to you.

1923
01:35:09,081 --> 01:35:10,750
-Please don't drive him away.

1924
01:35:10,751 --> 01:35:12,451
I really like him, Bianca.

1925
01:35:12,454 --> 01:35:14,123
I do.
And he likes me, too.

1926
01:35:14,124 --> 01:35:16,394
He thinks I'm beautiful.
-I know he does.

1927
01:35:16,395 --> 01:35:18,532
-And it's okay if you
feel a little overprotective,

1928
01:35:18,533 --> 01:35:20,837
but you don't have
to worry about me.

1929
01:35:20,838 --> 01:35:23,738
I'm very mature for my age.

1930
01:35:23,744 --> 01:35:25,580
-Yes, you are.

1931
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:30,321
And so, Jane, listen, I...

1932
01:35:30,323 --> 01:35:33,094
I think I've gotten
a little out of control

1933
01:35:33,095 --> 01:35:36,295
trying to control everything,
trying to keep you safe.

1934
01:35:36,302 --> 01:35:40,610
I mean, that's what I do.
That's what I've always done.

1935
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:45,687
But I've been so focused
on the person that you were

1936
01:35:45,688 --> 01:35:48,988
that I wasn't seeing
the person you've become.

1937
01:35:50,263 --> 01:35:53,101
I'm so proud of you, Jane.

1938
01:35:53,102 --> 01:35:56,382
And I'm really sorry
i didn't see that sooner.

1939
01:35:58,045 --> 01:36:00,075
-Are you okay?

1940
01:36:03,122 --> 01:36:05,192

1941
01:36:05,193 --> 01:36:08,365

you know?

Um, he'll be back,
but I'm really gonna miss him.

1946

while rob's away.
