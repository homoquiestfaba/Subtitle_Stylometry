Buenos Dias, cecelio!

18
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:39,523
Sir, I'm just sayin', your ad
says, "bad credit, no problem."

19
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,258
So can you define
"no problem?"

20
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,627
Because me not gettin' this loan
is a problem.

21
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,763
I'm sorry. That's why
I'm asking you to...

22
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,331
Sorry, daddy.

23
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,866
That's okay,
but that's just nasty.

24
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,335
No, no, no.
Not you, sir.

25
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,004
Okay, all right,
well, listen to this:

26
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,243
What if I have everything
I need except the $30,000?

27
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:57,440
Keep calm?

28
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,142
Sir. Sir.
Can you...?

29
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,478
Ma'am. Okay.
I-I couldn't tell.

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,680
Aren't you supposed to be
a predatory lender?

31
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,948
Then prey on me!

32
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,349
Okay?
You're a lion, I'm a gazelle.

33
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,718
Okay, fine. Fine.
Do you know what?

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,453
I'm puttin' my
daughter on the phone

35
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,955
so you can explain to her
why she has to go to school

36
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:13,056
in a gangbanger school district

37
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,124
where they're murdering kids.

38
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,492
Murdering!

39
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:16,960
Here,<i> you</i> tell her.

40
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,495
Hey, baby, do what I showed you.

41
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:22,365
Why do you want me
to get murdered?

42
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,000
- No.
- <i>Murdered.</i>

43
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,802
Why do you want me
to get murdered?"

44
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,837
They hung up.

45
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,373
Baby, because you're
not doing what I told you to do.

46
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,008
You are sick.

47
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,044
I'm not sick.
It's called desperate.

48
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:38,748
Baby, all we have to do
is keep saving.

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,483
I just need...
I just need some love.

50
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:42,085
Can you just hug me?
Just kiss me?

51
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,688
Mm. Any better?
Awkward.

52
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,090
Come on. Get your juice,
and your book bag.

53
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,059
I told you
to hit the bull's eye.

54
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,493
How hard is it to cry,
Makayla?

55
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,430
"Murder. Murder."

56
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:57,000
All right.
Watch out.

57
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,168
Move, old man.

58
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,836
Is that weed?

59
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:02,606
Hey, I want you
to be safe, okay?

60
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,773
Listen to me.

61
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,208
Listen to me.

62
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,475
You're not gonna be
at this school forever.

63
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,427
Daddy's workin' on it.

64
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:08,378
I love you.

65
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,513
I love you, too.
All right.

66
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,115
Don't worry.
Kinda hard not to worry.

67
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:13,117
You're my daughter.

68
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,388
Come on, dear.

69
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,556
Hey, watch it!

70
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:21,419
Matter a time.

71
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,606
Matter a time.

72
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:25,395
I kick, James!
Yeah.

73
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:28,031
Move!
Ha!

74
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,366
Ginga!

75
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,369
Hey, babe!

76
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,971
Watch this, honey.
Watch this.

77
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,441
Whoo!
Look at that kick!

78
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:40,744
Axé.

79
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,879
Good job, James!

80
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:51,421
You looked good out there,
my big strong fiancé.

81
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,290
Jaoa says I need to focus

82
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,226
on bringing my power
into the world.

83
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,663
Fuck!

84
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,966
Maybe I can help.

85
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,734
You...

86
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:09,272
Are a<i> great</i> man,
James King.

87
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,975
Do me on the new house.

88
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,017
Did it get bigger?

89
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:25,455
The King needs his castle,
James.

90
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:26,923
So powerful.

91
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,026
So you don't think
it's too much house, do you?

92
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:35,699
James, seriously?

93
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,201
I mean, you wanna raise a family
in<i> this</i> house?

94
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,836
Well, yes.

95
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:43,506
In<i> this</i> house?

96
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:47,811
No! No, this...
This house is a shithole!

97
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,612
Look...

98
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:54,050
There's winners
and there's losers, James.

99
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,320
It's what drives this country.

100
00:05:57,322 --> 00:06:00,156
All right?
People look at what you have...

101
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,891
And they want it.

102
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:06,062
They<i> want</i> your huge house.

103
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,897
And they want...

104
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,334
Your hot, hot...

105
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:12,635
Wife.

106
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:13,837
So hot.

107
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,072
Who's the King?
I am.

108
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:18,501
Are you the King? How much money
you gonna make today?

109
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:19,602
Enough to choke a baby.

110
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:20,759
That's right.

111
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:24,225
Yeah, are you a winner?

112
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,117
Yes, I'm a winner.
Yeah?
Whose tits are these?

113
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,309
They're<i> my</i> tits.

114
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,633
These are the King's tits!

115
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,358
The King's titties.
That's right.

116
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,916
Is it a King's dick?

117
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,908
It's... it's slightly above average.
Yeah?

118
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,967
You gotta stake your claim,
James.

119
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:40,292
Yes!
You gotta stake it!

120
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,217
Stake my... my claim!

121
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,008
Oh, come on, baby.

122
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:47,068

that was quite a ride, man.

169
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,536
That was like
third quarter 2012.

170

It's a real pleasure
to watch you work, sir.

00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,206
Thanks, Leo.
Yeah.

172

How 'bout that,
you knew my name!

173
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:07,343

00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:17,987
James.

178
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:22,592
You made my company
$28 million today.

179
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:23,625
Now, to celebrate,

180
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,663
I would like to give you
an early wedding present...

181
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,665
Partner.

182
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,568
Sir...

183
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,668
Thank you.

184
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,069
Gayle, a minute.

185
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,077
James, this is the moment
when you cross that threshold

186
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,414
and join America's
most elite.

187
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,450
Anything you desire,
anything you want is yours.

188
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,542
I'm ready for it.

189
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,888
You know, I bought an island
in Cape Verde?

190
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,223
An entire island.

191
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:55,390
You can, too.

192
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,851
I would love to.
We could be island neighbors.

193
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,899
You could swim over
and borrow a cup of gold.

194
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,157
Yeah.

195
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,541
You know, and to think it all
started with this.

196
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,209
I still have that computer.

197
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,744
It reminds me...

198
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:17,037
Of my humble beginnings.

199
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:21,551
How I built this company
with my own two hands.

200
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,152
Just me, that computer...

201
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,791
...and an $8 million loan
from my father.

202
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,967
You really did it all
on your own.

203
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:34,273
Very inspiring, sir.

204
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,602
Now, listen, I want you
to drop this "sir" nonsense.

205
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:42,405
You are marrying my daughter,
for Pete's sake.

206
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,242
I want you
to call me "Dad."

207
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:49,178
Really? Dad?

208
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,680
Mm-hmm.

209
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,792
That feels<i> very</i> good.

210
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,753
My... my real father
never had time for me.

211
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,188
He shipped me off to
boarding school in London

212
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,358
with the Murdochs
and the Bin Ladens.

213
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,761
Of course,
that was before...

214
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:10,133
I mean, we knew they cheated
in soccer, but had no idea...

215
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,334
You know...

216
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:14,470
But if I could choose a dad...

217
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:18,228
Hey, you know something,
you're family now, kid.

218
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,939
Okay, then.

219
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:24,663
Oh, boy.

220
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:30,019
Motherfucker.

221
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,040
Ah!
Mr. King.

222
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,875
Take whatever you want!

223
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,143
Please!
Oh, it's the hood.

224
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:55,712
Oh!
Hey! It's Darnell.

225
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,080
Help!

226
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,014
No. Stop!
Help!

227
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,315
Mr. King!
Help!

228
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,750
No!
Oh, dear lord.
Someone help me!

229
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,018
You're being ridiculous!

230
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,853
Stop!
Look at me.

231
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,655
It's me!

232
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,690
I got your keys!

233
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:11,427
Oh! Yes!
I see you.

234
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,263
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

235
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,254
Here you go.

236
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,496
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

237
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,502
Yeah.

238
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:20,580
And, just so you know,

239
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,735
I would have done the same thing
if you were white.

240
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,338
That's...
That's good to know.

241
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,075
Hey, Mr. King.

242
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,177
Um,
while I got you out here,

243
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,947
I just wanna... I just wanna
talk to you for a second.

244
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:33,716
I've... I've been washing
your car for two years now...

245
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:36,018
And, I mean, I can tell
that you're the type of man

246
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,587
who likes the best
of everything.

247
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,357
So as owner and CEO
of Hollywood Luxury Bubbles,

248
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,226
I wanted to offer you

249
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:47,029
an exclusive platinum
lifetime wash card...

250
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,732
For, um, for $30,000.

251
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,768
Now, before
you say anything,

252
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,237
think about the type of money
that you'll save

253
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,139
with this...
With this investment.

254
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,242
Well, actually the time value
of money is such that

255
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:02,211
if I were to put that same
amount in my own fund,

256
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:06,983
in 23 years time, I'd have
in excess of $3 million.

257
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,217
Wow. Yeah.

258
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:09,652
With that rate of return,

259
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,788
I could buy a new car every time
it gets dirty.

260
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,723
Isn't that impressive?
That's amazing, Mr. King.

261
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,325
You see, I didn't get to
the place where I am today

262
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:20,096
by asking for handouts...
But by hard work.

263
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,765
And today,
that hard work paid off...

264
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,435
As I was just named partner
in my firm.

265
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:29,405
Mr. King, that is... hey.
That is amazing.

266
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,807
Thank you so much.

267
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,141
That is...

268
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:33,409
Thank you.

269
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,478
That... that's amazing.
Mr. King,

270
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,979
we...

271
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:40,416
You see, everyone, whether
we're born rich or poor...

272
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:44,353
Or white...
Or miscellaneous...

273
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,155
Who we become...

274
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,957
Is based
on our own decisions.

275
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,091
It's simple as that.

276
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,294
And on that note...
No, Mr...

277
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,329
You don't have to give me
that much, Mr. King.

278
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:54,964
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

279
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,833
Mr. King, you don't have
to give me that much.

280
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,601
Mr. King. Hold on. 
There we go.

281
00:13:58,603 --> 00:13:59,802
You really don't need...

282
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,170
There you go.

283
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:02,471
There's a start.

284
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,473
Mr. King, please.

285
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,876
I feel like you just
haven't given me...

286
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,082
Success is a mind-set!

287
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:18,286
Wow.

288
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,535
Hi, everyone!

289
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:33,703
Hi!

290
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,339
Thank you<i> so</i> much

291
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:39,575
for celebrating our engagement
with us.

292
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,577
James, I love you...

293
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,146
And I can't wait to be married
to you.

294
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,153
And because
you<i> rock</i> my world...

295
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,855
I got you this!

296
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:56,659
Oh! Hey! Wow!

297
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,394
Come on.

298
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,832
This is beautiful.

299
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,101
But not as beautiful
as you, Alissa.

300
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,202
Aww.

301
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,404
I love you.
I love you.

302
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,407
Being with you and in front

303
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,542
of all of our friends
and family here...

304
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:17,613
I just wanna say, I'm the
luckiest man in the world!

305
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:18,948
Play something!

306
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,750
Oh.

307
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:23,352
Oh! Well, actually, there's one
more part to your present!

308
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,688
It's Mr. John Mayer!

309
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,424
John Mayer!
Thank you, thank you.

310
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,859
Hey, everybody!

311
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,862
Who's John Mayer?

312
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:35,031
I just wanna say, thank you,
James and Alissa,

313
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,198
for making me...

314
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,101
Shut up!

315
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,685
...a part of
your special night.

316
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,038
Thank you very much.

317
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,774
You ever seen a hundred women
get wet at the same time?

318
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,808
Watch this.

319
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:57,920

00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:04,627

323
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,307
John, lay back.
I'm gonna take a few bars.

324
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:31,587
Hey! Step aside, FBI!
Back up!

325
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,990
Everybody, step aside!

326
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:36,993
James King.
Yeah?

327
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,995
You're under arrest
for 43 counts of fraud

328
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,529
and 30 counts of
embezzlement.

329
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,131
Well, that's impossible.

330
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,182
Yeah, that's what they all say.
Get him outta here!

331
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,604
I know.
This is some kind of joke.

332
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,815
Is this some kind of joke?

333
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,369
'Cause if this isn't, this is
the worst nightmare imaginable.

334
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,673
Yeah!
Finally.

335
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,018
Are you gettin' this?
Shit, yeah!

336
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,609
Get outta the way!

337
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,879
I swear I don't know what any
of this is about! Mm-hmm.

338
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,949
Don't worry, son!
I'll take care of it.

339
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,784
Let's go.

340
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:05,888
Gayle, call my lawyer.

341
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,523
My party!

342
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,298
The charges are securities fraud
and embezzlement.

343
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,634
These transaction records
prove you're guilty.

344
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,669
I've never seen these.
These are fakes!

345
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:22,891
Boy, if you go to court,
they're gonna kick your ass.

346
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,740
Take the plea.
Dad!

347
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:26,809
Take the plea.
You'll be out in a year

348
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,280
and in the best
shape of your life.

349
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:29,378
No.

350
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,880
I have faith that
the justice system

351
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,348
will exonerate me.

352
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,517
And that the jury will
put aside their bias

353
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,851
and see the truth:

354
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,554
That I didn't steal money
from people.

355
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,562
I lost everything!
Fuck you!

356
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,197
I-I didn't do it!

357
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,233
Judge Carlyle: For too long,

358
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,736
wealthy white collar offenders
like you

359
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:55,371
have gotten a free pass

360
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,706
with light sentences
in minimum-security prison...

361
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,675
While working Americans
have suffered.

362
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,377
Well, that ends today,
Mr. King.

363
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:04,413
I sentence you to the harshest
penalty allowed:

364
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,016
Ten years in a
maximum-security prison.

365
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,886
You have 30 days to get

366
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,188
your affairs in order.

367
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,524
Just run them over!

368
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,359
I can't go to jail.
I'll die in there.

369
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,228
That's not gonna happen, James,

370
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,198
because I'm gonna put
my investigators on this 24/7

371
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,533
until we find out
who really did this.

372
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:27,552
Just make sure you stay within the
county lines with<i> that</i> thing on.

373
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,865
Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals
will be down there pronto.

374
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,942
Son, I want you to stay strong.
Do you hear me?

375
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:37,213
I will.
I'll be so strong for you, Dad.

376
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,654
Why me?!

377
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:47,623
Esquiva!

378

to tell my baby... ♪

379
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,673

It took so long to ring me up,

385
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,424
I had to miss my
waxing appointment.

386
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:23,492
I feel like a gorilla.

387
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,027
It's summer, too.

388
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,930
I can't believe this is
happening to me.

389
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,932
It's like they don't even
recognize you anymore.

390
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:31,056
Thank you. Yes.

391
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:33,728
Alissa! Hey!
It's me, James.

392
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:37,339
I know.
What are you doing?

393
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,375
Why do you look
like that?!

394
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,510
Just eat your fuckin' salads!

395
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:44,213
I'll fuckin' kill you
if you say anything.

396
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,549
Hi. Hi.

397
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:47,551
Hi.
Hi.

398
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:48,951
I came up with a great idea.

399
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,386
Let's just run away!

400
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:52,388
Some place that no one would
ever think to find us.

401
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,723
Mexico.

402
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:58,194
Let's just leave
this material world behind.

403
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,995
Live in a one-bedroom shack.

404
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:01,530
Oh, God.

405
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:04,742
Yes. You could sell
chiclets on the road.

406
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,617
What?

407
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,204
Look, we'll work out
the details later.

408
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,705
We should get out of here.
No!

409
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,207
I already cut off
my ankle bracelet.

410
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,841
No! No!

411
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:14,043
No!
Let's go.

412
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,377
James, no.
What?

413
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,912
No! I'm leaving you!
Why?

414
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:19,815
But I thought
you loved me forever.

415
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,051
Well...

416
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,819
Now you know.

417
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:29,325
Alissa.

418
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:32,228
<i>This is the U.S.
Marshal service.</i>

419
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,196
James King, exit the building

420
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,550
<i>and surrender to
custody immediately.</i>

421
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:37,542
Oh shit!

422
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:41,270
Hey, guys.
He's in there.

423
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,571
Oh!

424
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,341
Why are you arresting me?!

425
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,443
Me llamo es
reagando Esteban.

426
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,379
I am but a simple bartender
from Belize.

427
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,680
Wait, no. Mexico.

428
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:54,149
Call my lawyer in Tijuana.

429
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:08,097
Oh, shit! Aah!

430
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,448
What the fuck is that?!
Get off!

431
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:10,434
It's me!

432
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:11,634
It's me!
Mr. King?

433
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:12,399
Yes.

434
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:14,270
You scared the shit
outta me, man.

435
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,938
Whatcha doin' in the trunk?

436
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,041
I just needed... I just needed
a place to regroup.

437
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,876
You know, fresh start.

438
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:23,879
Okay. Hey.
Lemme help you out, man.

439
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,247
Ugh.

440
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,251
Fuck you, King!

441
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,120
I lost everything
because of you!

442
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:32,122
I didn't do it!

443
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:33,622
Fuck!

444
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,724
Fuck someone!

445
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:37,726
Fuck a tit!

446
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,089
Fuck a tit hard!

447
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,764
For the love of Alan Greenspan.

448
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:44,633
Fuck!
My life is ruined.

449
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:50,406
I venture you've heard
that I'm going to prison.

450
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,008
Yeah.
No, we... we all did.

451
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,977
I just didn't wanna bring it up
first, that's all.

452
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,646
Come on. They're probably sendin'
you to some club fed prison.

453
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,982
You'll be playin' tennis
and golf, you know.

454
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:03,452
I'm going to be attending
San Quentin.

455
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:05,254
They're sendin' you
to San Quentin?!

456
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,822
Oh!

457
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,657
What?
Oh, God!

458
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,426
Oh, they fuckin' in San Quentin.
Oh!

459
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,594
Everybody gets the dick.

460
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:15,420
They might as well call it
San fuckin', man.

461
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,334
I don't wish that
on my worst enemy.

462
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,802
You talkin' about bad?
That's bad.

463
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:24,039
You should know.
I-I'm sorry to remind you.

464
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,176
What are you...
What are you talkin' about?

465
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,129
Well, the fact
that you went to prison.

466
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:31,480
The fact
that I went to prison?

467
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,815
Yes.
Okay.

468
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,620
Just before I get to
another level of anger,

469
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,285
Mr. King,
just tell me for giggles,

470
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:37,811
how do you know
I went to prison?

471
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:38,905
It's really quite simple.

472
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,294
Statistical analysis
is what I do.

473
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,624
Here's the deal:
One out of three black men

474
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:45,627
will find themselves incarcerated
during their lifetime.

475
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,229
Imagine a pizza, okay?
Okay.

476
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:51,549
There are three pieces.
Three black pieces.

477
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:56,171
One of those pieces of pizza
will be thrown in jail

478
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:58,474
at some point
during its life.

479
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:01,744
You know what? Lemme give you
my statistical analysis.

480
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:03,379
You goin' to San Quentin...

481
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,148
There's 100% chance that you're
gonna be somebody's bitch.

482
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,385
Ten years of this:

483
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,353
You know what that is?
Mnh-mnh.

484
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:13,698
That's a big-ass black man
on your pale white ass.

485
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,560
You: "No!
I don't want any more!

486
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:20,929
"Stop! That's enough."
Too late.

487
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:23,332
He done tagged
the next guy in.

488
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,433
That's like a rabbit.

489
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,001
And you don't want him
no more,

490
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,257
so now here comes the guy
that wants to rub your face.

491
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,372
"Oh, I like his hair."
He's breathing on you.

492
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,840
That's disgustin'.
But guess what?

493
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,542
You can look forward
to 10 years of it!

494
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:35,711
What if I speak to all the
bitches and we organize...

495
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:39,014
Form a union, and we put our
feet down and say, "enough!"

496
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,730
There's gotta be more
of us than them.

497
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:41,817
Well, there's not.

498
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:43,761
You deserve everything
you're gettin'.

499
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:45,352
Good luck on survival, sir.

500
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:48,524
Better luck
on handling yourself!

501
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,692
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't leave.
Don't leave, please.

502
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:53,362
I could use your help.
Help you with what?

503
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:56,932
Help me to not be
someone's bitch.

504
00:23:56,934 --> 00:24:00,402
You expect me to help you?

505
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:01,911
I'm supposed
to teach you what?!

506
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:04,072
How to prevent this...

507
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:05,774
All right, stop.

508
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,576
You could train me.

509
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:10,612
You could be the Athena
to my Odysseus.

510
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,915
I don't even know what the fuck
that is, man!

511
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,917
I could pay you.

512
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,718
Whatever it takes.

513
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,754
I need $30,000.

514
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:19,922
Done.

515
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,224
O-okay.

516
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:24,226
Yup. Yeah.

517
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:25,894
Fantastic.

518
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:27,596
All right.

519
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:28,931
What're you doing?

520
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,633
I-I only know these two.

521
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,001
What are you trying to do?

522
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,515
Shake?
You wanna shake my hand?

523
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,262
Oh, yes.

524
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:37,591
Oh, regular.
It's a deal. We got a deal.

525
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,310
Excellent.
Thank you, Darnell.

526
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,443
I'll see you in the mornin',
convict.

527
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,011
What're you doin'?
What is that?

528
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:44,480
Tryin' to do<i> this</i> thing.
No.

529
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,348
Shake. It's fine.
Okay.

530
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,517
Mr. King, no.
I got that.

531
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,185
All right.

532
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:51,353
I appreciate it.

533
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:52,855
No problem.
I appreciate it.

534
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:01,530
Yes! Thank you!

535
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:07,936
Babe...
This does not make any sense.

536
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:09,271
Why would he hire you?

537
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:11,273
Because he thinks I went
to prison, babe.

538
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:13,108
See, that's the part
I don't get.

539
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,643
Why would you
tell him that?

540
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,645
I didn't tell him that.
He assumed that.

541
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:17,846
He assumed it?
Yes!

542
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,048
So what reason
did you give him

543
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,462
to assume that you went to jail?

544
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:21,617
I was bein' black.

545
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,486
This is nuts.

546
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,388
Okay. I don't get
what's nuts to you.

547
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,190
In 30 days,
we'll have the money,

548
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,325
the house'll be ours.
What is the problem?

549
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,296
The problem is
he is never going to believe

550
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:33,921
that you went to jail.

551
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:35,864
Look, babe.
I am your wife,

552
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,833
so I will put it
to you straight.

553
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:40,168
You are not exactly
a thug.

554
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,515
I don't have to be a thug
to portray a thug.

555
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:44,719
Okay?
Honestly, all I gotta do

556
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,543
is change my voice,
talk a little deeper.

557
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,811
Talk like this
and be every stereotype

558
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:51,179
he already thinks I am.

559
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,414
Right now, I'm thuggin'.

560
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,549
Yeah.
This is thuggin'.

561
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,385
You're so good at it,
sweetie.

562
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,987
Have a good night.

563
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:01,356
Bitch!
Don't walk away from me!

564
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:02,524
What the hell
did you just say to me?!

565
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,230
Girl, stop.
What is wrong with you?!

566
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:06,828
Stop! Stop!
What is that?!

567
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,097
I love you!
I was playin'!

568
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:11,900
Bitch.

569
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:13,268
What what what what?!

570
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,870
I didn't say nothin'!
Oh.

571
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,339
Man, I didn't say nothin'.

572
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:19,575
You wanna watch
"the notebook"?

573
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,876
I love you and Makayla.

574
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,844
Yeah, I love you, too.
Good night.

575
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,017
<i>You've reached the voice
mailbox of Martin Clark.</i>

576
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:30,786
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

577
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,021
Hi, Dad?

578
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:34,790
It's James.

579
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,560
Just wondering if there's any
word from the investigators.

580
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:41,096
I still love you.

581
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:44,066
Uh, thank you. Bye.

582
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,301
<i>Now, I heard a crazy story
about you.</i>

583
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,036
<i>This guy James King?
Yeah.</i>

584
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:50,038
<i>And I heard that you played</i>

585
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,808
<i>at the party
where he got arrested.</i>

586
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,242
<i>Yeah. I had no idea</i>

587
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,211
<i>that I was performing
for a monster.</i>

588
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:57,879
<i>I don't know how
to really explain</i>

589
00:26:57,881 --> 00:27:00,320
<i>what it's like to take money
from someone like that.</i>

590
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:02,392
<i>It makes you wanna
give it back to them,</i>

591
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:05,023
<i>except that would be worse
because then they'd have it.</i>

592
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:07,155

00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:09,625

594

Hey, Russell.
It's, uh, it's Darnell.

609
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:58,607
Your cousin.
Your cousin, Darnell, man.

610
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,708
Hey, listen, Russell...

611
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,276
How would you like to make $500

612
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,945
just for telling me
what prison was like?

613
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:06,848
Yeah. Well, I don't...
I don't wanna say that.

614
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,351
Russell,
I shouldn't have to say that.

615
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,852
For... for what?!
What is...?

616
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:12,521
Fine. Fine.

617
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:15,357
I'm a Cliff Huxtable
pussy-lookin' motherfucker.

618
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,727
No!
I'm not even wearing khakis.

619
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:21,229
Russell, can you please
just help me,

620
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:22,564
what I'm asking you for?

621
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:24,800
Just start from the beginnin'.

622
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:26,535
No, no. Like, the beginning
the beginning.

623
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,136
Like, the first day of prison.

624
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:32,340
On... on the first day?!

625
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:35,177
Oh! There's no warmup?

626
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,012
That's sad.

627
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:39,081
Russell, I'm sorry,
did I just hear a gunshot?

628
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:42,018
You gotta go.
Okay. Bye-bye.

629
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,661
Ready, mother...

630
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:53,862
Ready, mother...

631
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,197
Ready, mother...

632
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,364
That's it, that's it.

633
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:02,003
Coming!

634
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:05,774
Rita, Makayla, new house,
good school.

635
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,743
You ready, motherfucker?

636
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,711
Just a second!

637
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:16,785
Hello? Hello?

638
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:18,854
You ready, motherfucker?!

639
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,856
Aah!
Oh, it burns!

640
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:23,625
Pepper spray, bitch!

641
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:25,961
Rule number one: You always
be on guard, okay?

642
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,462
'Cause on the inside,
there's somebody

643
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:29,258
waiting around every
corner to fuck you up!

644
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,742
Prison school is in session,
bitch!

645
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:33,568
You already failin'.
Aah!

646
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,570
I'm so glad I hired you.

647
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:37,105
This is just what I need.
Ohh.

648
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,574
Okay.
Uh, what's next?

649
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:41,109
What the...

650
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,611
How many motherfuckers
live here?

651
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:45,614
All right.
Let's get started.

652
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:48,416
This right here is
my prison readiness program.

653
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,652
Now, if you follow this guide
and do exactly what I say

654
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:52,587
you will definitely survive
in prison.

655
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:55,457
"Keistering."

656
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:58,160
What's, uh, keistering?

657
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,061
Slow down!
You ain't ready for that.

658
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,330
You're the teacher.
And I just want you to know

659
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll do whatever it takes to
survive and get my life back.

660
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,968
That's good, 'cause let me
tell you somethin':

661
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,570
You're gonna have
to work harder

662
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,071
than you ever
worked before.

663
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:13,108
You know, back when I was in
Harvard business school,

664
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,777
I was facing some
pretty long odds.

665
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,512
But I buckled down
and I succeeded.

666
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:18,980
When you was at Harvard,

667
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:20,651
did you ever get raped
for failing a test?

668
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,751
I think that's more
of a Yale thing.

669
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:31,459
"Yale."
I'm sorry.

670
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,511
Shut the fuck up!

671
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,534
Now from this point on,
this ain't your house no more.

672
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,002
This San Quentin!

673
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,170
You understand me?
Okay.

674
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:44,573
From now on
this will be your cell.

675
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:47,229
You do not leave this room
without my permission.

676
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,529
It's good.

677
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,415
For you to sleep on,
señor.

678
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,083
Go on, we ain't got time
for games.

679
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:57,113
Go upstairs, finish turning
this place into prison.

680
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,446
It will be our pleasure

681
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:00,104
to repay you for
your many kindnesses.

682
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:05,694
Put that in there in front of
the statues with the dicks.

683
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,563
James, listen to me.

684
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,997
The key to survival
in prison

685
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,532
lies in the following
simple questions:

686
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:13,201
Are you hard?
And can you handle yourself?

687
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:15,237
Well, this is a rare
moment for optimism

688
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,573
because the answer to that
is a resounding yes.

689
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,107
Well, that's good.

690
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,909
Let me see what your mad-dog
face look like.

691
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:22,411
I'm sorry.
What's a mad dog?

692
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,546
You a mad dog!
Oh, shit.

693
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,182
What's your what, nigger? Huh?
Take whatever you want!

694
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,117
Let me see that!
No!

695
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,920
Stop! I beg of you!

696
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,522
Like a pit bull
with no leash.

697
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,794
That's a mad dog.

698
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,129
Wow. I knew you were
the right guy for the job.

699
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,646
In prison, a mad-dog face is
essential to your survival.

700
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,100
Do you understand me, James?

701
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:47,035
So the idea is that
I make a face

702
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,403
that conveys the fact that

703
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,439
I would have no problem
hurting you.

704
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,940
Exactly what it is.

705
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:52,975
Now convey that shit.

706
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,710
Let me see it.
Okay.

707
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,548
Ha!

708
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,483
That's terrible.

709
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:03,051
No, that's horrible, man.
Anger.

710
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,487
You gotta show me anger.
Why you smilin'?

711
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:08,123
I'm not smiling.
I'm tense and I'm agitated.

712
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:08,957
Come on, man!

713
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,392
Huh?

714
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:11,627
That's your mad...
That's it?

715
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,295
Yeah.
Your fiancée left you.

716
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:14,262
Huh?
That's right!

717
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:15,731
Y-you happy about that?

718
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,232
No.
Then get mad!

719
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:18,900
She gonna leave you?
What is she doin'?

720
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:20,502
She probably on her knees

721
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,738
sucking somebody dick
in the backseat of a truck.

722
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,673
Show...

723
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:26,775
James.

724
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:30,278
Oh. Oh. Come on.
Come on.

725
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,347
I miss her so much.

726
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:34,068
Oh, what the fuck
are you doing, James?

727
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:36,163
I'm sad-dogging you.

728
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:38,854
James?

729
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,956
You think that's a strategy
that could work?

730
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,759
No, I don't. I don't think it's
a strategy that could work.

731
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,380
Hey, listen up, everyone.
I'm extremely sad.

732
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,830
Please don't
sexually assault me.

733
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,132
I'm already too sad.

734
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,001
Hey, fellas.
My heart's already been raped.

735
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:54,703
Wait. I don't wanna
do this anymore.

736
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:57,116
Let's move on. Okay? We're
movin' on from the mad dog.

737
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,007
James, can you fight?

738
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,810
Absolutely.

739
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,812
Esquiva.
Esquiva.

740
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:05,480
What?
Esquiva. Esquiva.

741
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,617
You had to change your
clothes for this?

742
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:08,850
Entrada.

743
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:11,787
What the fuck are you doin',
man?

744
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,691
It's called Capoeira.
It's a Brazilian martial art.

745
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,160
But don't be fooled
by its beauty and grace.

746
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,862
It's actually quite deadly.

747
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:22,597
This is deadly?

748
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,000
That's deadly?

749
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,334
Stab.
Ow!

750
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,803
Stab.
Stop.

751
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,171
Stab. Stab.
Guards!

752
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,472
Guards!
What are you...

753
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:32,307
Stabbity stab, stab, stab!
Ow! Ow!

754
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:34,543
What the fuck
are you doin', man?

755
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:38,046
Shit ain't gonna save you
in San Quentin!

756
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,748
Well, that may not,

757
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,332
but you haven't seen
my bencao kick.

758
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:43,412
Your what?
My bencao kick.

759
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:47,806
Bencao!

760
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:49,891
Look what your dumb ass
done did.

761
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,094
Stab. Stab.

762
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,895
I'm dead.
Stab.

763
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:56,832
I'm dead.
Stab, stab, stab, stab.

764
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,203
You're so bad.

765
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,904
Aw, James.
I gotta tell ya.

766
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:05,841
I just can't imagine what you
must be goin' through.

767
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,510
Ahh. It is so nice
to talk to you.

768
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,712
So, what's the latest
from the investigators?

769
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:14,449
The investigators?
Uh, Chinese hackers.

770
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:15,784
They're pretty sure.

771
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:17,219
Hey!
I know I'm not crazy.

772
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,754
Didn't I tell you
to get off the phone?

773
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:19,567
Get off the phone.

774
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:20,770
Hey, who are you
talkin' to?

775
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:22,557
It's, uh, it's Darnell.
He's helping me.

776
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,792
Get... your time is up!

777
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:25,460
I-I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

778
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,464
Hang it up!
Hopefully, if I get more phone time.

779
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,066
Hang it up!
That was important to me!

780
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,277
Yeah, well, when you got
a long line of angry inmates

781
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,371
waitin' to use
the phone,

782
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,603
you do<i> not</i> wanna piss them off,
James.

783
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,638
I'm going to fuck you up,
Mr. James!

784
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,106
Rosa!

785
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:40,041
You watch your back
on the yard.

786
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,410
Puto.

787
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:44,859
I'm not a puto.

788
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:48,101
Great.

789
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:51,107
All right. We got a problem.
What's that?

790
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,722
James is talking
to somebody.

791
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,090
Oh, no, no,
h-he trusts you.

792
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,625
He'll never put
two and two together.

793
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,926
No, stop it, Peter!
Stop it!

794
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,661
This is your fault!
What?

795
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:02,130
Well, you couldn't get him to
take the plea deal, right?

796
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:04,099
Instead of him
goin' to prison,

797
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:07,169
you got him 30 days to be out
there, runnin' around...

798
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,905
Fucking things up!
I had to make it look good.

799
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,158
You throw a fight, you don't
go down in the first round.

800
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,074
It's fine.

801
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,810
I don't want him out there,

802
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,978
playin' detective with somebody.

803
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,015
You keep an eye on my ex
future son-in-law, would ya?

804
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,117
And find out
who this Darnell is.

805
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,985
I'm on it.
Right away.

806
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:26,021
There you go.

807
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:29,991
All right, James.

808
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:32,212
Look, you're gonna get in
a fight on the inside. Okay?

809
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:33,954
Now, you don't need to win
these fights,

810
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,353
but you need
to show these guys

811
00:35:35,378 --> 00:35:36,884
that you're not afraid
to fight back.

812
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:38,228
Gotta get used
to fightin', man.

813
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:39,668
See those guys over there?

814
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,037
Wow.
Yes.

815
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,793
I want you to go over there and I
want you to fight one of them.

816
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,709
That's insane!

817
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:49,611
They're...
They're behemoths.

818
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,346
They would break my spine.

819
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:52,848
Yeah, well, those are
the type of guys

820
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,149
you're gonna see
in San Quentin.

821
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:55,517
So you gotta shake
that fear, man.

822
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,885
I want you to go over there

823
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:58,487
and punch that big-ass dude
in the mouth.

824
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:02,057
Oh, my God.
My heart is pounding.

825
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:04,693
Okay.

826
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:16,738
Hey, guys.

827
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,774
Who the fuck are you,
man?

828
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:24,646
I wanna fight you.

829
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,017
What?

830
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:30,285
You picked the wrong day
to come to the park.

831
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:33,898
Is this some kind
of joke, man?

832
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:35,522
You ever been
mad-dogged before?

833
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:38,727
You about to get some right now,
motherfucker.

834
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:42,530
What the fuck is that,
man?

835
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:44,199
It's the size of your dick.

836
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:49,104
I'm gonna break it off,
make you eat it.

837
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,873
You...

838
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,575
You fuck your mother
with that dick?

839
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,710
How do you know my mama?
You don't know my mama.

840
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,579
Oh, no.

841
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:00,682
Get him!
Get him!

842
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,284
Get back here, bitch!

843
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,086
Oh, no!
Please don't hurt my body!

844
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:06,521
Aah!

845
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,223
No! My body!

846
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:11,092
Help! Help me!

847
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:13,528
You're breaking my spine!

848
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,374
Wait. What happened
to my tennis court?

849
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:29,577
James, you will no longer refer
to this area as a tennis court.

850
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,713
From this point on,
this is the yard.

851
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:33,415
Understand something, James.

852
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,750
The yard is<i> the</i> most deadliest
part of prison.

853
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:38,053
It's where you come to get
your few precious minutes

854
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,387
of fresh air
and sunlight.

855
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,056
Do you understand me?
Mm. Fresh air.

856
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,426
How many times did I breathe in
clean air,

857
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,561
fragrant with lavender,
and take it for granted?

858
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:48,398
James, I don't give a fuck
how many times.

859
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:49,397
I don't give a shit.

860
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,466
I'm just saying.
Shut up, James.

861
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,068
You gotta step carefully

862
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,448
because if you step in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

863
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,963
you'll end up
in the wrong territory.

864
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,613
For a person like you
that can't fight,

865
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,870
it's not a good thing, James.

866
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:01,176
It's not a good thing
at all.

867
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,178
Right now, you in the
brothas-only section, man.

868
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,113
You got two seconds to get
your white ass out,

869
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,414
before you get
mollywhopped.

870
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,682
Okay, Darnell.
Who's Darnell?

871
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:09,784
You are.
My name is Leroy!

872
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:11,319
Yeah, I suggest you walk,
white boy.

873
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,520
All right.
Walk!

874
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:13,855
I'm walkin'.
Turn around and walk!

875
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:15,857
I'm walkin'.

876
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,425
Hey, ésse.
What?

877
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:19,160
You got a problem, gringo?

878
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:20,328
Darnell,
what are you doing?

879
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,330
Darnell?
Who's Darnell, ésse?

880
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,965
You're lookin' at Carlos.

881
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:26,048
I suggest you walk wherever
you came from, ésse,

882
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:27,298
before you
have a problem.

883
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:28,970
I just was trying
to leave<i> that</i> area.

884
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,672
Okay, well, you need to go back
over there with the negros, ésse.

885
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:31,973
With Leroy?

886
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,508
You go back over there
with the negros!

887
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,176
'Cause that's
where you belong.

888
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:37,382
I don't see anyone.
Yeah, you belong with the negros.

889
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:38,313
Go.
I'm going.

890
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,281
Fuck you callin' a negro,
Carlos?!

891
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,883
He was. I wasn't.
I told you, Carlos!

892
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:43,551
Keep that shit over there
on your side!

893
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:45,520
Take that Yankee with you!
I'll go with you!

894
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,489
Hey, I don't want him.
I don't want him.

895
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,924
He's a negro lover.
You take him.

896
00:38:48,964 --> 00:38:49,897
Why don't I...

897
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,560
Motherfucker, car...
Say somethin' else, bro!

898
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:54,696
Hey!
Hey, I swear to God.

899
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:55,458
Guys, please!

900
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,974
I swear to God,
I'll cut you, ésse.

901
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,402
Let's just shake hands.
There is no shaking hands, gringo.

902
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,175
Friendship.
You go back where you belong.

903
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,425
I don't know
where I belong.

904
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,906
Leave him alone. I'll keep him.

905
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:06,741
You belong with me.

906
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,411
W-who are you?
I'm Dante.

907
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,513
Why don't you
leave him alone, Carlos!

908
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,881
Leave him alone, Leroy!

909
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,316
Are you a woman?
I am if you want me to be.

910
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,485
I don't want that.
No, okay, I know what you are.

911
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:18,820
Let me hold your pocket.

912
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:20,488
Let me hold your pocket.

913
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,556
All right.

914
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:22,857
I claimed him!

915
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,926
He mine, Leroy!

916
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,262
Bitch! You got two seconds to
let his fuckin' pocket go.

917
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,097
Two!
Oh!

918
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,680
Motherfucker! You got two seconds, bitch!
Don't hit a woman!

919
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:32,844
Gonna knock your ass out!

920
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:34,758
Don't hit a woman!
You don't want my pocket.

921
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:36,237
You don't want it.
So what?

922
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,573
Why can't I be happy?
Hey, essé.

923
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:40,608
I don't like you
and this domestic shit

924
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,110
in front of me
and my crew.

925
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:43,545
I don't...
You think I like it?

926
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,593
You need to fuckin' take it
somewhere else, essé.

927
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:48,083
Huh? Gringo, you take you
and your dirty bitch elsewhere.

928
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,751
I'll just go all the way over there.
Don't call me dirty, Carlos.

929
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:52,887
I wasn't dirty
when you was up in it.

930
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,556
I wasn't dirty then, was I?

931
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,758
You were dirty then.
You're dirty now, bitch.

932
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,571
So what?
So what?

933
00:39:57,634 --> 00:39:58,701
You should be...

934
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:00,546
He ain't complainin'.
You should get tested.

935
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:02,452
He ain't complainin'.
No, I'm not complaining

936
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:04,639
because we have yet to have
any sort of interaction.

937
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,092
Mnh-mnh.
Tonight will be our night.

938
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:07,514
No, we won't.
Tonight won't happen.

939
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,741
Hey. Be my white knight.
Save me.

940
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,453
Don't get your hopes up.
Let me ride you.

941
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:12,106
R-ride me?
Let me ride you into safety.

942
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:13,684
No! I don't feel comfortable
with that.

943
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,106
Don't let them fight you
like that.

944
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:16,817
Let go of me!
Leroy is going to be upset.

945
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:18,075
I knew you were
coming back.

946
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,447
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

947
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,360

I knew you were coming back.

motherfucker!

00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:23,954
I'm not doing anything!

950
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:26,196
Motherfucker, I'm about to whoop
your ass, white boy!

951
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:27,649
That's it! That's it.
That's it, gringo.

952
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,533
I swear to God, I'm
getting sick of this shit.

953
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:31,032
I'll fuckin' stab you.

954
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,138
I'm still confused as to what piece
you are in this puzzle, Carlos.

955
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,762
Hold on!
Huh? What?

956
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:37,732
Question, question.
Are there any French gangs?

957
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:40,935
I speak French.
I'm not fluent, but I can...

958
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:44,305
Uh, je m'appelle James?

959
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:47,308
Can I join the gang,
s'il vous plait?

960
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,177
You know what, James?
You can't fight.

961
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,512
Being that you can't fight,

962
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,280
that means I'm left
with one choice,

963
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:54,349
and that's to get
your stupid ass in shape.

964
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,519
God!
You're failing.

965
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,121
I've got a state-of-the-art gym

I heard you!

00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,100
That's your plan?
Yes.

1003
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:20,768
All I'm sayin'
is that when life

1004
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,937
puts a dick in your mouth,
you make dickade.

1005
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:24,439
"Dickade" doesn't sound like

1006
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,507
a significant improvement
over dick.

1007
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:27,909
Okay.
Bottom line, James...

1008
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:29,410
I know what
I'm talkin' about.

1009
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:31,613
We're talkin' about survival.
I understand.

1010
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,248
'Cause that's how
<i>you</i> survived. Right?

1011
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,684
No, you shut your mouth.
No, it is not.

1012
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:38,119
I survived with these.

1013
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,121
Dual hand jobs.
No. No!

1014
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:41,556
I kill with these.

1015
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:44,692
That's the difference
between me and you.

1016
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:47,128
Hence, why you need
to suck a dick.

1017
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,825
Come on, man.

1018
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:52,200

Look around you.

1021
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,872
This is L.A.'s number-one

00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,707
Voted "flirtiest brunch"
three years in a row.

1023
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:03,111
But what do I say?
What do I literally say?

1024
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,946
You say,
"I wanna suck your dick."

1025
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:06,447
Politely.

1026
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,049
"Hey, hi. I'm James.

1027

00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:14,645
I wanna suck your dick.

What if someone says no?

1033
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,660
He ain't gonna say no.

1034
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:19,794
It's a scientific fact.

Is that a real site?
No.

1038
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:27,235

Get up.

1039
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,137
You're gonna go...
You're gonna go to that bar.

can you suck his dick?

1043
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,077
Oh, my gosh.

1044
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,745
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1045
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,647
Survival.

1046
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:41,749
Go survive.

1047
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:44,152
All right.
I'll just go do it.

1048
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,420
Yes, go do it.

1049
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:51,125
Okay. Come on.

1050
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:53,428
Are we doing this
or not, okay?

1051
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,296
Yes,
we're definitely doing it.

1052
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:58,766
Hey, I was nervous the first
time I did karaoke, right?

1053
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,768
Yeah.
Just get up there and sing.

1054
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,671
This is terrible foreplay.
Come on.

1055
00:44:03,673 --> 00:44:05,673
I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
Yeah.

1056
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:07,709
I'm gonna suck your di...
Your di...

1057
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,211
I'm gonna suck your di...

1058
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:11,679
Yeah,
that's what we're here for.

1059
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:13,314
I'll gonna put your di...
In my mouth.

1060
00:44:13,316 --> 00:44:15,149
I'm gonna give you hea...

1061
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,284
Facial.

1062
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,553
Down the hatch! Ha.

1063
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,127
Eating alone?

1064
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:29,297
I just thought you could use
some company.

1065
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,800
Oh. O-okay,
I see what this is.

1066
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:36,304
You... you think that you can...
That you can get with me?

1067
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,574
Ooh, interesting topic of conversation.
Wait. No.

1068
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,310
That wasn't a sit-down
invitation.

1069
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,712
You're like...
You're like a 6.

1070
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:47,582
Thank you.
No, it's not a compliment.

1071
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,250
That's not a...
That's not a good number.

1072
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:50,551
I'm like a 9.

1073
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:53,087
If I were to get
into this game...

1074
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,590
You know, the gay game...
Uh-huh.

1075
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,326
By the way, the gay game
is a game you can win.

1076
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,194
No, I-it's not,
'cause I don't wanna play.

1077
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:02,163
I'm saying "if."
If I were to...

1078
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,832
There's a spot on the bench
for ya, if you decide to join.

1079
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:06,834
No, I'm not... I'm not...
On the bench, man.

1080
00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:08,169
Okay, starter!

1081
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:09,837
I'm not gay, man.

1082
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,208
I'm here supportin' a friend,
doin'... doin' some gay stuff.

1083
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,777
I'm sorry.
My name is Chris.

1084
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,246
It's short for Christmas
came early this year.

1085
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:24,285
Where are you at, man?

1086
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:25,686
Come on, man.

1087
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:28,122
This is gonna help me
in the long run.

1088
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:29,624
Here. Right there.
Ooh.

1089
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,093
Don't point it at me.
Just...

1090
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,628
Hey!
Have fun with it, right?

1091
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,797
Yeah.
Have fun with it.

1092
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,699
Come on.
Three, two, one! In the mouth!

1093
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,377
Aah!

1094
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,546
Look, you're gonna find
you someone, man.

1095
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,214
You just gotta
set your sights

1096
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:55,249
on something more realistic,
you know?

1097
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:56,617
This is what
I need to hear.

1098
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,252
Yes! Yes.

1099
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:00,054
I can't do it.
I really tried.

1100
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,589
I just... I just can't!

1101
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:03,724
You have to train me.
It's my last chance.

1102
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:06,627
Are you ready to train harder
than you've ever trained before?

1103
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:09,230
Because once we go,
we do not hold back.

1104
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:10,898
We do it,
and we do it hard!

1105
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,333
Are you ready
to get hard?

1106
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:13,901
I am ready.
I'm ready to get hard!

1107
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:16,404
You're gonna show me
that you can get hard!

1108
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,172
I'm gonna show you!
I'm gonna get so hard!

1109
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:20,733
'Cause I'm gonna show you how hard!
That's what I wanna hear.

1110
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:22,100
Then let's go home
and get hard.

Sho' enough!

1123
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:51,405

Hey, back off!

You better get those tits
out of my face!

1130
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:05,853
Or I'll show you<i> my</i> tits!

1131
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:07,188
What're you doin'?

1132
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,689
Working on my trash talk.

1133
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:10,892
You know, to get respect
from the other inmates.

1134
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,860
Let me hear some of it.

1135
00:47:12,862 --> 00:47:15,363
Uh, all right.

1136
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:19,367
Hey, pal.
I'm about to tear you a new ass.

1137
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,370
You gonna have to do a little
better than that, James.

1138
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:25,206
Hey, I'm about to tear you
a new ass.

1139
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,842
And sew up your old ass!

1140
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,510
Okay. All right.

1141
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,879
I'm gonna punch you
in the fuck!

1142
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:34,215
I'm gonna make you
my bitch's bitch!

1143
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:36,851
You're gonna be
my grand bitch!

1144
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:40,388
Yeah. You're about to
get 20 likes on instafuck.

1145
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,723
If I see you
around here again,

1146
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:44,692
I'm gonna put a hashtag
on your ass

1147
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:46,427
and see how many hits
it gets.

1148
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,729
Hmm?
Oh, my God.

1149
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,231
Hope you brought
your Costco card,

1150
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,933
'cause you're about
to get dick in bulk!

1151
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,560
What?
This is so dark.

1152
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:54,879
You eat organic?

1153
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:58,482
How about fresh farm-to-table,
a purée of my balls!

1154
00:47:58,521 --> 00:47:59,440
Yeah.

1155
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:02,043
Merry dickmas,
Santa cock!

1156
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,411
Hmm?

1157
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,845
Okay.
All right, man.

1158
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:06,747
Where is this stuff
comin' from, James?

1159
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:09,917
Hey, son. You're a
disappointment to your parents.

1160
00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:11,686
Who I fucked!

1161
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,954
Oh, shit.

1162
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,455
James, this is sick.

1163
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:15,957
You gotta be crazy
to think of this.

1164
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,959
That crazy is good.

1165
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,861
Thank you.
I've got about six hours more.

1166
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:22,829
That's good, James.
That's really good.

1167
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:23,689
Okay.

1168
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:25,866
I like that.
Good.

1169
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:27,969
I like that a lot.
All right.

1170
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,770
I hope you brought
your dick punch-card

1171
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:31,472
'cause the eighth
dick is free.

1172
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:33,074
Stab!

1173
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,875
Ah, shit!

1174
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:37,311
That's not bad, James.

1175
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:41,515
That's not bad at all.
Progress.

1176
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,892
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled cocks!

1177
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:55,029
Yes.

1178
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:02,470
Hey, hey, hey!

1179
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,573
You ready
to get to work today?

1180
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:07,174
Huh?

1181
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:08,843
Hello.

1182
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,444
What's all this stuff?

1183
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:11,946
Oh, these are shanks.

1184
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,948
Or "shivs."

1185
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,518
In Scotland, they're referred to
as "chibs."

1186
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,989
In fact,
I made this one for you.

1187
00:49:21,991 --> 00:49:24,191
Really?
Yeah.

1188
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:27,962
Just to say thank you
for all the hard work.

1189
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,430
Ah, man.

1190
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:31,832
That's nice.

1191
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,494
That's cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1192
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:35,536
Don't... don't hold it
by the blade.

1193
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:37,471
Haven't you ever
held one before? Right here.

1194
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:40,975
Yeah, no, no, my cellie
used to hold 'em all the time.

1195
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,416
I don't like 'em. I feel like
they cause too much trouble.

1196
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:45,985
You pull that out on the yard,
somebody come out attack you,

1197
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:47,930
they can do this to you.
Now what do you do?

1198
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:49,086
You know what I mean?

1199
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,484
Huh!

1200
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:52,987
What the hell?!
Where'd that come from?

1201
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,488
I taught myself
how to keister.

1202
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,657
How to... Keister?
Yeah.

1203
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,492
Up the keister?

1204
00:49:58,494 --> 00:49:59,994
Look.

1205
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,862
The electronic toothbrush part,
it still works.

1206
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:02,557
Oh, no.

1207
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:03,731
Okay, James.

1208
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,299
James, cut it off.
Cut it off.

1209
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:06,500
Get it outta my face, man.

1210
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:08,002
I can turn it on
with no hands.

1211
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,236
I don't want to see that.

1212
00:50:09,238 --> 00:50:10,504
I don't want to see
that trick.

1213
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:11,562
It's okay.
Put it back.

1214
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:13,374
God.
Put it back?

1215
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:15,076
No. No, no.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1216
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,510
Please.

1217
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:18,015
Do you want me
to teach you how?

1218
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,195
Nah, I'mma pass on that.

1219
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,215
It starts with a simple
inverse inhale.

1220
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:24,518
James, stop it.

1221
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,021
That, with a simultaneous
relaxing of the sphincter.

1222
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,023
Okay, I don't...
I don't wanna know.

1223
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,524
You sure?

1224
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:31,859
James, I'm... I'm positive.

1225
00:50:31,861 --> 00:50:33,392
I just wanna ask you
one question.

1226
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,229
I was over there,
and I was touchin'...

1227
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:37,665
I was touchin' all those shanks.
Yeah.

1228
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,067
Were... were they...

1229
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:42,036
Keistered?

1230
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,938
Yeah. Were they...
Were they keistered?

1231
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:46,540
Most of 'em.

1232
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,908
Yeah.

1233
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:59,520
We're about to simulate
a prison riot.

1234
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:02,423
Understand that this is the most
dangerous situation there is.

1235
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:04,458
Prisoners are scared.
Guards are scared.

1236
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,428
The key to survivin'
is to not freak out.

1237
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,597
Good lord.
What's gonna happen?

1238
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,432
Cecelio's just gonna throw
some stuff at you.

1239
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,100
Some roosters,
some mangly homeless guys,

1240
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,368
whatever he's got.

1241
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,627
He's really excited
about this.

1242
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,271
Okay.
Let's do it.

1243
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,606
Wait,
don't I get body armor?

1244
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,150
No. We don't have
that type of time.

1245
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:21,108
Cecelio!

1246
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,977
Why don't we have
enough time?

1247
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,112
James, remember,
do<i> not</i> freak out.

1248
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:27,481
Lights! Music!

1249
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:30,284
Who wants to party?!

1250
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:32,386
Go! Go! Go!

1251
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,321
Cecelio!
Release the chickens!

1252
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:37,124
No, no, no, James!
Don't freak out!

1253
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:39,660
Darnell, there's a baboon!

1254
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,796
You're in my world now!

1255
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,964
Someone let me out!

1256
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:45,666
Stop freaking out!

1257
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:50,004
It's fuckin' beautiful!

1258
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,108
Oh, shit!

1259
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,477
Die! Die!

1260
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:03,184
Cecelio, turn it off!
Turn it off!

1261
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,319
Turn it off!

1262
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:08,656
James, I've lost control!
Cecelio! Pull back!

1263
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,457
I have lost control!

1264
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,161
Oh, my God!
Ah, God!

1265
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:15,663
Oh, my God.
Shit!

1266
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,631
Ah! I'm stabbed!
No!

1267
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,834
I'm cut!
No, you cut me, man!

1268
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,135
You stabbed me!

1269
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,603
No, I didn't!
Yes, you did!

1270
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:24,478
I told you, don't freak out!
You freaked out!

1271
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,806
God! Wait.

1272
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:27,641
No, I'm okay.
Hold up.

1273
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:29,643
It's just the wine.

1274
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:31,278
I see all the wine, man.

1275
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,513
I totally feel fine.

1276
00:52:32,515 --> 00:52:34,215
Oh, fuck!

1277
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,150
What?

1278
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,519
Oh! Don't...
Don't... don't...

1279
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:40,154
That's where
the other one went.

1280
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,456
Yeah, okay, just sit down.
It's a shiv.

1281
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:43,758
It's just a shiv.
Yes, I know.

1282
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:45,159
Hey, don't freak out.
I know.

1283
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,161
I'mma pull it.
Okay.

1284
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,001
Oh, my God.
It's like a fishhook.

1285
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:56,170
The more you pull,
the deeper it lodges.

1286
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,927
All right. Okay.
Look, my wife's a nurse.

1287
00:52:57,952 --> 00:52:59,673
Let's get you to my wife.
Okay?

1288
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:01,041
God.

1289
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:04,044
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

1290
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:06,146
It's sticking
right out of my head.

1291
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:07,414
James, listen.

1292
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:09,183
I don't want to look at it
no more

1293
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,251
because I'm startin' to...

1294
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,685
Oh, shit.
I'm so scared.

1295
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:13,354
I know.
I just don't wanna...

1296
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,902
Can you fuckin' just keep
your head...

1297
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:15,723
Ohh!

1298
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,691
Oh, God!

1299
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:19,260
You drove it in
a little deeper.

1300
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:20,995
Oh, God.
Oh, James, I'm sorry.

1301
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,696
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1302
00:53:22,698 --> 00:53:24,732
Is my eye twitching?
No!

1303
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,367
Answer the question.
Is my eye twitching?

1304
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,002
It look fine.
Yeah?

1305
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,436
Yeah.
Does it look fine?

1306
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:31,739
Yeah, fine, man.
There's nothing wrong.

1307
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,574
Let's play a memory game,
okay? Engage.

1308
00:53:33,576 --> 00:53:34,875
Yes.

1309
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:36,243
What up?
Give me 12 months.

1310
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,579
Months. One, two...

1311
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,747
No.
Four...

1312
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,749
Summer, Christmas...

1313
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,251
What?
Baked potato...

1314
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:45,686
What is "baked potato"?

1315
00:53:45,688 --> 00:53:46,854
Wait.
Did I leave one out?

1316
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,056
No. You're right.
You're right.

1317
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:49,356
Those<i> are</i> the months.

1318
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:52,092
Thanks for driving me
to college, Dad.

1319
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:54,695
What?
What the fuck?

1320
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:57,231
But don't start crying when you
drop me off at the dorm,

1321
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,766
'cause then
I'll start crying.

1322
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,102
I love you, Dad.

1323
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:05,272
Love...
Love you, too, man.

1324
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:06,740
This is where
I need to get out.

1325
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:08,275
James! James! No!

1326
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:12,780
Close the door!
Close the door!

1327
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,349
Are we at Coachella?
No, James!

1328
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:21,488
Rita, thank you once again

1329
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,324
for taking the knife
out of my head.

1330
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,658
Mm.

1331
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:42,843
Makayla, what...

1332
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,345
Young lady.

1333
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,347
But<i> he's</i> doing it.

1334
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,848
This is delicious.

1335
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,151
Okay, James.

1336
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:52,936
Stop. Stop.
You don't have to eat like that.

1337
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:54,188
You're on furlough.

1338
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,924
Mm. Sorry.

1339
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,926
It's part of my training.

1340
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,829
If you let someone mess with
your food, you're a punk.

1341
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,864
It's delicious, though.

1342
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:07,368
Look, you need to shut
this stuff down right now.

1343
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,338
Do you understand you're gonna
get him killed

1344
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,775
before he even gets to prison?
What're you talking about?

1345
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,298
No. Darnell's doing
a wonderful job.

1346
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:14,208
He's a great teacher.

1347
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,877
See that?
And a great friend.

1348
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:19,013
The only thing
I can't figure out

1349
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,881
is how he ever went to jail
in the first place.

1350
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,051
Gosh, me neither.

1351
00:55:22,077 --> 00:55:24,283
You know, Darnell, have you
every shared with James

1352
00:55:24,308 --> 00:55:25,711
the story of
how you went away?

1353
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:27,021
No, he hasn't.

1354
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,899
Well, he's not really ready
for that right now.

1355
00:55:28,924 --> 00:55:30,858
And I got... and I got Makayla
at the table.

1356
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,027
I mean, she's the daughter
of a convicted felon.

1357
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,962
She's strong.
Mm-hmm.

1358
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,397
Good point.
Why don't you tell it.

1359
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,033
And don't leave out any details.

1360
00:55:41,002 --> 00:55:43,837
I-I'd love to hear it.

1361
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,372
I think it could
really help me.

1362
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,308
Okay.

1363
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,913
Uh, we was... we was just
some boys in the hood.

1364
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:56,717
Me, my man Ricky,
and Doughboy.

1365
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,385
Doughboy's real name
was Russell.

1366
00:55:58,387 --> 00:55:59,820
We was close, man.

1367
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:01,685
Ricky, thing about Ricky,
Ricky was special,

1368
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,923
'cause Ricky had
the ticket.

1369
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:05,059
Ricky was
star quarterback.

1370
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,561
You know,
he had a college future.

1371
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,997
He was our golden boy,
you know?

1372
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,865
We got into it
with some other guys.

1373
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:13,500
You know,
some gangbang stuff.

1374
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,869
On the way home
we decide to split up.

1375
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,172
Me and Doughboy said
we'll go this way.

1376
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,007
Ricky said
he'll go this way.

1377
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:23,510
Me and Doughboy come around,
we see Ricky on the ground.

1378
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:25,913
Ricky got shot.

1379
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,015
I run over there.
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'.

1380
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,917
I grab him.
I got his head on my arm.

1381
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,852
I'm lookin'.
I'm like, "Ricky!"

1382
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:35,022
Ricky!

1383
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,958
Aah!

1384
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,895
Ricky.

1385
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:43,297
He...

1386
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,765
He had the ticket!

1387
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:47,034
They got him.

1388
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,802
Doughboy's like,
"come on, man. Get up.

1389
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:50,037
Let him be.
He's done."

1390
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,872
I get up.

1391
00:56:51,874 --> 00:56:53,807
Doughboy says,
"you know what this mean.

1392
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,609
This mean we gotta step up."
Oh, no.

1393
00:56:55,611 --> 00:56:57,311
I said,
"you damn right, it does."

1394
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,412
So we strapped up.

1395
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,447
I don't know
what that means.

1396
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:02,216
It means we got the burners.

1397
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,251
I don't know
what<i> that</i> means.

1398
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:06,553
It means we went
and got the guns.

1399
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:09,389
We saw those guys
later that night.

1400
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:11,925
Three head shots.
Bop! Bop! Bop!

1401
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:14,328
"That's for Ricky!"

1402
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,562
For sure.

1403
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:18,565
Cops came, man.

1404
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:22,136
I told Doughboy
I'd take the rap.

1405
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,805
I said, "you go ahead.
Live your life.

1406
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:26,740
I'll tell 'em it was me."

1407
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:31,311
Cops came. I said, "I did it."
I went to jail.

1408
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:37,084
You gave your life
and your freedom for Russell.

1409
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:40,621
Loyal to a fault.

1410
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,458
It is what it is.
That's why I wash cars today.

1411
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,126
'Cause I got blood
on my hands.

1412
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:48,462
Just like Lady MacBeth.

1413
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,597
Huh?
Like MacBeth.

1414
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:52,299
Yes.

1415
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:53,934
Yes.

1416
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,136
Phew!
Wow, what a story.

1417
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:58,505
Almost sounds like a movie.

1418
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:00,374
- Whew.
- Yeah.

1419
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,642
Mm-hmm.

1420
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:03,644
Darnell,
why don't you tell him

1421
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,147
about that time that that white
lady came and adopted you...

1422
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:09,650
And turned you
into an offensive tackle.

1423
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,652
I think we've talked
enough tonight.

1424
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,854
Oh, there's my cab.

1425
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:16,356
I'd better get back
before lockdown

1426
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:18,825
or Cecelio will put me
in the hole.

1427
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:21,161
He loves putting me
in the hole.

1428
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:23,530
Well,
let me walk you out, man.

1429
00:58:23,532 --> 00:58:27,034
No, that's fine.
Thanks for everything.

1430
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,969
James, it was wonderful
meeting you.

1431
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:30,170
Great to meet you, too.

1432
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:31,738
You know, growing up,

1433
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,174
my family would never spend
any time together like this.

1434
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:36,461
You guys are very lucky.

1435
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,478
Bye, Makayla.

1436
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,881
Bye, Mr. King.

1437
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:42,349
Bye-bye.

1438
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,055
Hey, your dad never went
to jail, okay?

1439
00:58:48,422 --> 00:58:50,691
I've seen "Boyz n the Hood."

1440
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,993
Who showed you
"Boyz n the Hood"?

1441
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:55,195
Daddy,
I don't think he did it.

1442
00:58:55,197 --> 00:58:56,830
Of course he didn't.

1443
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:59,199
You need to do something
that's really gonna help him.

1444
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:01,929
He will<i> not</i> last in prison.

1445
00:59:02,265 --> 00:59:04,571
He wouldn't even last
in my school.

1446
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,770
Hello, this is James.

1447
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:38,071
Hey.
It's me, Darnell.

1448
00:59:38,073 --> 00:59:39,640
Look, man,
I've been thinking it over,

1449
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,275
and I think it might be
a good idea

1450
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,243
to get you some extra protection
on the inside.

1451
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:45,824
So tomorrow were gonna go over
to my cousin Russell's house.

1452
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:46,878
Now listen to me, James.

1453
00:59:46,903 --> 00:59:48,324
My cousin Russell
and his friends,

1454
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:49,957
they're a different
type of dudes, man.

1455
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:51,191
Very suspicious
of outsiders.

1456
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:52,394
I mean,
you walkin' in there,

1457
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:54,472
they're probably gonna think you
a cop off the bat.

1458
00:59:54,497 --> 00:59:56,089
So I need you to do
something for me

1459
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:58,058
so we don't create any
dangerous situations.

1460
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,404
Dress more casually.
Blackface.

1461
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,727
What the fuck was that?

1462
01:00:00,729 --> 01:00:02,596
Uh, s-see you tomorrow.

1463
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:03,964
James. James.

1464
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:05,799
James, don't...
Don't do nothing stupid.

1465
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:06,801

Who you supposed to be
dressed like, James?

1478
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:54,881
Little Wayne.

1479
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:56,692
It's what he wore
at his last runway show.

1480
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:57,784
Oh, lil Wayne.

1481
01:00:57,786 --> 01:01:00,053
You told me I needed
to try to fit in,

1482
01:01:00,055 --> 01:01:03,056
so I stayed up all last night
studying your culture.

1483
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:04,124
I'm sorry, what?

1484
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,625

1485
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:08,128
is the only indigenous
American art form,

1486
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,664

I-I'm not trying to appropriate
your culture.

1496

That's great.
I'll tell the others.

1497
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:35,522
I'm just saying, hip-hop

1498
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:37,724
is a very sophisticated,
multifaceted subculture

1499
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:40,026
that speaks to all
different types of people.

1500
01:01:40,028 --> 01:01:44,331
The music, the... the fashions,
the attitudes, the beefs...

The more I read,
the more I listened,

1502
01:01:47,169 --> 01:01:50,837
the more I felt connected
to its rich cultural tapestry.

1503
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:52,439
That is really great.

1504
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,618
Now, can we please be done
with this conversation?

1505
01:01:55,737 --> 01:01:57,110
Please stop.

1506
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:02,282

Hello.

1519
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:28,937
James King, senior fund manager,
Wealthrop Funds.

1520
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:30,267
James, come on.
Excuse me.

1521
01:02:30,324 --> 01:02:31,591
Right through here.

1522
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,049
Hell naw, man.
Is this the motherfucker

1523
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:38,285
who you said you had to get
ready for prison, man?

1524
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:42,389
Well, I-I need...
I need protection,

1525
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,825
and I'm hoping to join
the Crenshaw Kings.

1526
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,293
Are you?

1527
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:49,629
Hey, I've seen
white people before.

1528
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:52,008
My probation officer is white.
You know what I'm saying?

1529
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:53,633
But you, motherfucker, man,
you...

1530
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:55,302
You white as mayonnaise, man.

1531
01:02:58,104 --> 01:03:00,807
Oh, shit. Maybe in blackface.
Who knows?

1532
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:03,310
Hey, listen.

1533
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:04,778
I tell you what, though.

1534
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,613
You damn sure got
your get-up right, man.

1535
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:08,315
I mean, camouflage
and cheetah print,

1536
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,317
that's straight out
the gangbanger's handbook.

1537
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,819
Yeah, yeah,
like... like lil Wayne, right?

1538
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:14,321
Exactly.
Thank you.

1539
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,323
I love it.

1540
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:19,192
Look, he's not trying
to be a member, okay?

1541
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:21,828
H-he just wants you to protect
him while he's on the inside.

1542
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,831
L-like you did for Darnell
when he took the rap for you.

1543
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:27,334
What?

1544
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:31,171
That's... we can talk about that
another time.

1545
01:03:31,173 --> 01:03:33,173
Yeah.
No.

1546
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,374
So let's let that go.

1547
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:36,343
Y-you remember.
You know.

1548
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,002
With what Ricky did
and the ticket...

1549
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:38,815
No.

1550
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:40,213
And you freaked out

1551
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:42,849
and Darnell took control
of the situation.

1552
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:44,284
Stop.

1553
01:03:44,286 --> 01:03:45,519
Is this motherfuckin'...

1554
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,487
"Boyz n the Hood," man.

1555
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,859
This is a bad time.
Okay, I tell you what, man.

1556
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:55,729
I tell you what: Humor me.

1557
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,064
I'm a fair person.

1558
01:03:58,066 --> 01:04:00,133
And I'm a businessman.

1559
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:02,002
Clear professional.

1560
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,237
What's your life worth
to you?

1561
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:06,806
How does a million dollars
sound?

1562
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:09,843
"How does
a million dollars sound?"

1563
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:11,878
Hold up, everybody.

1564
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,246
Stand back.
I'll handle it.

1565
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:15,048
How does a million dollars
sound?

1566
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,751
Man, a million dollars sound
like a one with six zeros

1567
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,920
behind it with two commas
separating them.

1568
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,688
However, from the sound of CNN

1569
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,256
and the looks of
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>

1570
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:25,344
and everybody else that people
with eyes and ears

1571
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:27,352
go to get they news,
you broke, motherfucker.

1572
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,429
Your assets have been frozen

1573
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:31,932
with no chances of thawing
anytime soon.

1574
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,167
So you probably got as much
or less

1575
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:36,603
than this little no good,
manipulative,

1576
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:39,439
degenerate motherfucker
right here next to you.

1577
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:41,541
Which forces me
to ask the question,

1578
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:42,876
"are you fuckin' with me?"

1579
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,444
You think this
a motherfuckin' game?

1580
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:45,745
You think I'm playin'?

1581
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:47,581
Why would you come up
in my hood,

1582
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,103
in my house, man, and present
yourself as somethin' you not,

1583
01:04:50,128 --> 01:04:51,851
offerin' shit you know
you can't deliver?

1584
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:53,690
Did this motherfucker tell you
to lie to me?

1585
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:54,437
Russ.

1586
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:57,190
Shut the fuck up, man.

1587
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:59,626
I think, real fast,
you need to tell me

1588
01:04:59,628 --> 01:05:01,428
what the fuck
you gonna do

1589
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,431
to make me wanna keep
motherfuckers off your ass.

1590
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,601
You're talking
to James King.

1591
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:10,870
Let me create wealth
for you.

1592
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:17,444
So the normal minimum buy-in to
the nexel fund is $5 million,

1593
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,814
but I can get you guys in using
a brokerage pocket account.

1594
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,383
In other words, liquidate
two bricks of cocaine

1595
01:05:23,385 --> 01:05:24,784
and park it right here.

1596
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:27,420
Now, with the historical
performance of the fund,

1597
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:29,923
that's gonna double
every three to five years,

1598
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:32,959
and we're looking at
$1.2 million easy.

1599
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:34,641
Ain't no way you're making
that much money

1600
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:35,941
without committing a crime.

1601
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,497
With apologies to Balzac.

1602
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:38,798
You pussy.
What the fuck?

1603
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,425
You talkin' about
my ballsack, nigger?

1604
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:42,002
No.

1605
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,270
W-what we're gonna do is we get
other people's money

1606
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:46,506
who've made an opposite
prediction on the market.

1607
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:49,175
Okay, we gonna roll on them
and take they money.

1608
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:51,845
Just how strapped are
these loser motherfuckers?

1609
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,648
Oh, I-I wouldn't worry.
I've taken millions from them,

1610
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:58,451
and they haven't stepped
to me, yet.

1611
01:05:58,453 --> 01:06:01,021
Loser motherfuckers.

1612
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,024
Damn.
Mayo is badass.

1613
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,625
Stock market is gangster.

1614
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:07,527
Take what's yours and fuck
the other guy, right?

1615
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:10,797
Wall Street, man.
Those are the real criminals.

1616
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,966
Those guys get away
with murder.

1617
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:16,102
Wait, man. You murder people
all the time, black.

1618
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:19,539
Oh, yeah.
Murder's my favorite.

1619
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:27,547
You should know,
you did a'ight this time.

1620
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:29,115
Your boy Mayo
is an earner.

1621
01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:31,551
Are you gonna get him some help
on the inside?

1622
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:32,452
I'll help him.

1623
01:06:32,454 --> 01:06:33,720
But not with us.

1624
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:36,523
You know,
inside it's all about color.

1625
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,526
Dude need a white gang.
A<i> very</i> white gang.

1626
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,728
But I'll put
the play together.

1627
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,630
♪ We can't be stopped now ♪

1628
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:46,199
♪ 'cause it's bad boy for life ♪

1629
01:06:52,006 --> 01:06:54,974
That's... that's the gang
I have to join?

1630
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:56,409
They seem kind of racist.

1631
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:58,244
Ain't no "kind of."
They are.

1632
01:06:58,246 --> 01:07:00,180
That's the alliance of whites.

1633
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,083
That's also your only chance
of survival in prison,

1634
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,328
so you need to go in there
and you need to make them

1635
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:06,696
believe
that you're one of them.

1636
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:08,266
Matter of fact,
call me the n-word.

1637
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,223
But say it like you
mean it, though.

1638
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:11,157
Let me hear it.

1639
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:12,358
What?

1640
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,593
No.

1641
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:15,261
That's the wrong "n-word."

1642
01:07:15,263 --> 01:07:17,507
Come on, James, I'm giving you
a free pass right now.

1643
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:19,666
In this truck,
the "n-word" is perfectly fine.

1644
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,901
Just another word right now.
Go ahead.

1645
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:24,170
That still doesn't feel...

1646
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:25,572
All right, let's try this.

1647
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,243
What's that place
where your leg bends?

1648
01:07:27,268 --> 01:07:28,074
My knee?

1649
01:07:28,076 --> 01:07:29,442
Okay.

1650
01:07:29,444 --> 01:07:31,010
And what noise does
a angry dog make?

1651
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:32,545
Grr?

1652
01:07:32,547 --> 01:07:33,547
Put it together, though.

1653
01:07:33,548 --> 01:07:35,682
Knee. Knee grr.

1654
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,818
Ow!
Oh, shit!

1655
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:37,618
I'm sorry.

1656
01:07:39,187 --> 01:07:41,253
I am sorry, man,
that just... that happened.

1657
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:43,433
That literally
just happened.

1658
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:47,193
Wow, I got you good, too.
It just, like, jumped out, man.

1659
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,062
It was a reflex.
I-I really can't tell you.

1660
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:51,231
I didn't even say it.
I was saying two other words.

1661
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,233
I apologize, James.
What do you want me to do?

1662
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,935
Just get your ass out the car
and go in there, act hard.

1663
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:58,938
Fit in, man.
Go ahead.

1664
01:08:00,975 --> 01:08:02,942
Cut the light off!
Shit!

1665
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,719
Fuck yeah!

1666
01:08:23,397 --> 01:08:24,764
Spider, you're up.

1667
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:27,066
Watch and learn, son.

1668
01:08:31,347 --> 01:08:33,011
Hi.

1669
01:08:34,456 --> 01:08:37,610
Uh, if I could have
your attention, please.

1670
01:08:37,612 --> 01:08:39,791
I'm just looking for someone
by the name of spider?

1671
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,314
He's a narc!

1672
01:08:43,238 --> 01:08:44,317
Listen...

1673
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,686
This relationship can't just be
built around him.

1674
01:08:46,688 --> 01:08:49,155
I mean, you got a right to be
happy, too, you know?

1675
01:08:49,157 --> 01:08:50,957
<i>And I am, I am.</i>

1676
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:53,293
<i>And I think I'm open to it
now because of our talk.</i>

1677
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,961
Yeah. That's good.

1678
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,831
I love the fact that you're
listenin'. I love that.

1679
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:01,034
<i>You know, you're the best
boyfriend I never had.</i>

1680
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:02,335
Okay.

1681
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,872
<i>Yeah, well,
I'm not totally giving up.</i>

1682
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:07,841
<i>There is time.
And things change with time.</i>

1683
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,209
No, no, they don't.

1684
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:12,111
No. No, no.
That's never gonna happen.

1685
01:09:12,113 --> 01:09:13,479
<i>You say that now.</i>

1686
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:15,181
No, no, no.
I'm always gonna say that.

1687
01:09:15,183 --> 01:09:16,482
<i>Okay.</i>

1688
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,230
Okay.

1689
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:22,021
Aw, shit.

1690
01:09:22,023 --> 01:09:24,724
Hey, I... I gotta go, okay?

1691
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:26,426
So I'll talk to you later.
Have fun.

1692
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:38,238
Private club, Jew hair.

1693
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,374
Good one, spider.

1694
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:45,211
I walked right into that one.

1695
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:47,380
Uh, James King.

1696
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:48,748
Protestant.

1697
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,818
But, uh, Russell,

1698
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,187
from the Crenshaw Kings,
referred me?

1699
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:56,356
Yeah, Russell said
you'd be by.

1700
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,325
Anyway, I'm going to prison
and I need protection.

1701
01:09:59,327 --> 01:10:01,561
Well, welcome to the club,
Jimbo.

1702
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:03,363
Great! Oh, good!

1703
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:06,165
But you get protection from us,
we got rules.

1704
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,901
Principles.

1705
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:11,671
Rule number one:
When you're on the inside,

1706
01:10:11,673 --> 01:10:14,173
you don't hang out with
the niggers or the spics.

1707
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:16,676
Now, do you have a problem
with that, brother?

1708
01:10:16,678 --> 01:10:18,177
Me?

1709
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,681
O-of course not.

1710
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,350
Spider...

1711
01:10:24,352 --> 01:10:25,952
What do you take me for?

1712
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:28,588
I'm a big-time racist.

1713
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:31,758
I hate the knee.
What?

1714
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,427
What is this shit?

1715
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:37,697
I mean, heck,
I'm such a racist

1716
01:10:37,699 --> 01:10:39,899
that my chess set,
I only have white pieces.

1717
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:42,368
It's confusing, but I don't...

1718
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,437
I won't give the blacks
a chance to win.

1719
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:46,272
Oh, shit.

1720
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:48,141
He's a fucking cop.

1721
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:50,209
He's a cop!
I smell bacon.

1722
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:51,648
I'm not a cop.
Fuckin' hate narcs.

1723
01:10:51,673 --> 01:10:53,313
We'll find out what he is.

1724
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:05,491
Oh, God. Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit. Oh, my God.

1725
01:11:08,663 --> 01:11:11,731
I'm just wondering if maybe
I'm not the best fit

1726
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:13,466
for the Alliance of Whites.

1727
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:16,903
You got anything to confess
before I rip your face off?

1728
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:20,273
Fine! Go ahead!
Kill me!

1729
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:22,508
But please tell the world
I'm not a thief!

1730
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:24,677
I did not do the things
they said I did!

1731
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:31,484
Promise me, spider!
Promise me!

1732
01:11:31,486 --> 01:11:32,952
Burn him.

1733
01:11:32,954 --> 01:11:35,421
Aah!

1734
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:40,560
The fuck was that?!

1735
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:43,463
That's right!

1736
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,832
A black man just came in
with a flamethrower,

1737
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:49,369
just like you
always knew would happen!

1738
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,537
Yeah!

1739
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:53,272
The devil in here, bitch!

1740
01:11:53,274 --> 01:11:54,707
And he's a black man.

1741
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:56,175
Stay yo ass back!

1742
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:57,477
Stay back!

1743
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,479
James! Let's go!

1744
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,847
Yeah.

1745
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:03,383
You all right?
Yeah. Come on.

1746
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,386
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

1747
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:09,055
You know what?

1748
01:12:09,057 --> 01:12:11,285
I got something I wanna say
to y'all since I'm guessin'

1749
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,277
this is the first time
that you've ever been forced

1750
01:12:13,302 --> 01:12:14,277
to listen to a black man.

1751
01:12:14,302 --> 01:12:15,355
You know, maybe you guys

1752
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,696
should just calm the fuck down.

1753
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:18,564
Black people ain't tryin'
to hurt you!

1754
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:20,633
I mean, technically,
<i>I</i> am right now.

1755
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:22,035
But that's only because of

1756
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,337
what you were tryin' to do
to the white guy.

1757
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:25,738
Think about that!

1758
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,074
Google "I have a dream,"
assholes!

1759
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:31,310
It's a teachable moment here,
people.

1760
01:12:31,312 --> 01:12:33,579
Should burn everybody
in here.

1761
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:40,386
Run, James!

1762
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:41,587
Oh, shit!

1763
01:12:41,589 --> 01:12:43,389
Bring me their fucking heads!

1764
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:45,425
Run, James! Run!

1765
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,546
What the fuck are you
knocking over the bike for?

1766
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:48,561
Run!

1767
01:12:48,563 --> 01:12:50,263
Oh, God.

1768
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,398
You just couldn't say
"nigger," huh?

1769
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,933
What?!

1770
01:12:53,935 --> 01:12:56,102
You can't see the irony
in being mad at me about that?

1771
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,237
No!

1772
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,040
Motherfucker!
It's Nazi titties!

1773
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:03,109
And they're huge!

1774
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:07,113
Get out!

1775
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:09,048
Oh, shit!

1776
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,050
Bitch,
get your white ass off!

1777
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:13,786
Goddamn it!

1778
01:13:13,788 --> 01:13:15,455
Oh, go, go, go!

1779
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:17,781
You blew up my club,
Jew hair!

1780
01:13:17,969 --> 01:13:18,984
Oh, shit!

1781
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,060
Post-racial America,
assholes!

1782
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:23,696
Fuck you, Nazis!
Yeah!

1783
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:30,503
I'm so glad to be back in
Crenshaw where it's safe.

1784
01:13:32,873 --> 01:13:35,074
My heart is just now
finally settling.

1785
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:38,644
Yeah.
We're... we're alive.

1786
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:42,215
How 'bout we make a toast
to escaping fucking Nazis.

1787
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,683
Yes.

1788
01:13:51,017 --> 01:13:52,625
You really are innocent,
aren't you?

1789
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:55,561
Yes. Absolutely.

1790
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:57,263
Okay, so, James,
if that's the case,

1791
01:13:57,265 --> 01:13:59,689
then why aren't you tryin'
to find the guy that framed you?

1792
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:00,760
We are.

1793
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:02,835
Who are?

1794
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:05,838
Now, Martin has a team
of investigators

1795
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,473
working around the clock.

1796
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:09,242
He's keeping me up to date.

1797
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,810
But the million-dollar
question is:

1798
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:12,945
Who falsified
my transaction records?

1799
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:14,680
All right, lay it on me.
All right.

1800
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:16,649
Now, this is very complicated
to follow.

1801
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:19,018
I don't expect you to get it
on the first pass,

1802
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,453
so listen very carefully.

1803
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,100
The one thing you need
to understand

1804
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,089
at the Wealthrop Fund

1805
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:25,591
is that everything flows
through Martin.

1806
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:27,527
Okay?
Okay.

1807
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,630
Any sort of contact with the
clearing house, the traders,

1808
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,332
access to trading records
and client information,

1809
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:35,501
international accounts,
institutions,

1810
01:14:35,503 --> 01:14:37,637
and, of course, the doling out
of commissions

1811
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,773
all goes through Martin.

1812
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:42,842
So it's Martin.

1813
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:44,977
No.
Are you fucking ki...

1814
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:46,879
It's common sense, James.
Look!

1815
01:14:46,881 --> 01:14:49,715
All arrows point to Martin!

1816
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:52,685
The only name on the board
is fuckin' Martin!

1817
01:14:52,687 --> 01:14:54,220
Martin! Martin! Martin!

1818
01:14:54,222 --> 01:14:55,788
Come on!

1819
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,490
James, you need to focus.

1820
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:58,824
You're goin' to prison

1821
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:00,492
unless you can prove
that Martin did it.

1822
01:15:00,517 --> 01:15:02,648
Then we'd need to get a hold
of the master records,

1823
01:15:02,673 --> 01:15:04,296
which is a log of all
transactions made

1824
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:05,257
by anyone in the firm.

1825
01:15:05,282 --> 01:15:06,365
Okay, how do we get it?

1826
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,034
Martin has the original copy

1827
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,803
on the same computer that he had
when he started the company.

1828
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:13,539
You got to be the dumbest genius
I've... get up, James!

1829
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:15,641
All right.
Fuck the board!

1830
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:18,411
Let's go, James!
We're going to Martin's office.

1831
01:15:24,518 --> 01:15:27,887
Act natural, James.
You walkin' like you guilty.

1832
01:15:27,889 --> 01:15:29,689
Hey, big guy,
you catch the game?

1833
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,923
Yeah.

1834
01:15:30,925 --> 01:15:32,258
Hey, big guy,
my name is Ken.

1835
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,626
I work here.

1836
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,235
Okay. Okay.
It's in this cabinet.

1837
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,670
We just have to
figure out a way to

1838
01:15:44,672 --> 01:15:46,806
get the door open.
Watch out.

1839
01:15:49,276 --> 01:15:50,710
I got it.

1840
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,278
Ah. There it is.

1841
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,547
Same computer he had
when he started the company.

1842
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:56,749
It's a good luck charm.
Good luck charm, my ass.

1843
01:15:56,751 --> 01:15:58,718
It has no connection
to the outside world.

1844
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,287
No e-mails, no Internet,
no trace.

1845
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:04,957
There it is!
The master records!

1846
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:07,760
That's what we need.
This will clear my name.

1847
01:16:07,762 --> 01:16:09,662
Oh, well, then let's not waste
time. Get it.

1848
01:16:11,565 --> 01:16:14,600
Yes!
I'm not going to prison.

1849
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:17,103
More importantly, I'm not gonna
be anyone's bitch.

1850
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,238
Hey, you are livin' the dream,
my friend.

1851
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,941
Darnell?
Yeah?

1852
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:23,309
Look, you saved my life.

1853
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,444
I don't know how I'll ever
repay you.

1854
01:16:25,446 --> 01:16:26,545
Oh, come on, man.

1855
01:16:29,049 --> 01:16:31,150
Just this once.

1856
01:16:35,122 --> 01:16:36,789
All right, break it up.

1857
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,791
Leave the cart there
and back away.

1858
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:39,892
Move away, come on.

1859
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:41,394
Move, move.

1860
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,562
I actually respect you
for trying,

1861
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:44,997
but enough is enough, James.

1862
01:16:44,999 --> 01:16:46,699
All right.

1863
01:16:48,769 --> 01:16:50,603
What are you doin'?

1864
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:52,505
James, what are you doing?

1865
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,407
Don't mad-dog, James.

1866
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,243
He's gonna shoot us.

1867
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,844
What the fuck?

1868
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:00,680
No.

1869
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,348
He's gonna kill us, man.
Do you want some?

1870
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,016
Oh, fuck!

1871
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:05,851
Do you wanna step with me?!
Aw, God!

1872
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:07,920
You'd better... don't...

1873
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:09,655
Oh, shit!

1874
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:12,024
The gun!
Grab the gun!

1875
01:17:12,026 --> 01:17:14,193
Huh?
Why don't you pick up
the gun!

1876
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:16,095
Uh...
Grab it!

1877
01:17:16,097 --> 01:17:18,130
Yeah. I got it, I got it!
I got it.

1878
01:17:18,132 --> 01:17:19,598
Yeah, I got it.

1879
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,835
You look a little nervous.

1880
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:24,136
First time holdin' a gun?

1881
01:17:24,138 --> 01:17:25,871
Nope.

1882
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:28,307
Motherfucker, freeze!

1883
01:17:28,309 --> 01:17:31,510
'Fore I pop yo ass!
"Pop"? Really?

1884
01:17:31,512 --> 01:17:33,679
I would listen to him.
This man's a dangerous felon.

1885
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,781
Yeah, except
when I ran his record,

1886
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:37,983
it was the cleanest one
I'd ever seen.

1887
01:17:37,985 --> 01:17:40,019
Not even a parking ticket.

1888
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:41,354
Yeah.

1889
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:42,788
What?

1890
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,458
You didn't know?
Yeah.

1891
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,393
Stop dickin' around
and give me the gun.

1892
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:49,895
- Come on.
- Give me the gun.

1893
01:17:49,897 --> 01:17:51,964
I think you have
the safety on.

1894
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:53,666
Shit!

1895
01:17:55,169 --> 01:17:57,536
See? Safety's on.

1896
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:59,238
Safety off.

1897
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,610
Martin was right.
You<i> are</i> a lucky little shit.

1898
01:18:08,382 --> 01:18:10,081
Don't give me reason
to find you again.

1899
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:11,129
Either of ya.

1900
01:18:18,558 --> 01:18:20,393
Don't you mad-dog me,
James.

1901
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,928
Listen, listen, I got some
explainin' to do.

1902
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,563
James!

1903
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:26,899
We can talk about this
after we go catch this guy.

1904
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:28,567
You traitor!
"Traitor"?

1905
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:30,903
Everything you taught me
was a lie!

1906
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:32,905
And now I'm fucked
beyond all fucktitude!

1907
01:18:32,907 --> 01:18:36,175
M-my life's asshole
is... is fucked!

1908
01:18:36,177 --> 01:18:39,111
You stop with your unorthodox
style of cussin'!

1909
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,613
You just remember:

1910
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:44,183
Whatever happens to me in
there, it's your fault!

1911
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:45,751
Oh, stop.
That's bullshit, man.

1912
01:18:45,753 --> 01:18:48,053
Okay, I may have lied to you
about goin' to jail,

1913
01:18:48,055 --> 01:18:49,755
but I did my job.
I got you ready!

1914
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:50,890
Ready for what?!

1915
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,426
Maximum-bullshit prison?

1916
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,763
I almost sucked a dick
because of you!

1917
01:18:57,765 --> 01:19:00,666
I don't even give a shit.

1918
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:04,236
It's<i> my</i> sign.

01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:17,116
between Roth and the
traditional IRA's.

1926
01:19:17,118 --> 01:19:18,717
Fuck is wrong wit' you?

1927
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,619
The shit is pretax.

1928
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:21,954
No, no, no, it's okay.

1929
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:23,489
A lot of people get confused
by that.

1930
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:25,746
No, this bitch is gonna mess
around and get us audited.

1931
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:26,817
Say what you mean, son.

1932
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:28,629
You got five years' receipts,
motherfucker?

1933
01:19:28,654 --> 01:19:30,996
And the strip club
ain't no home office!

1934
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:32,731
That's a red flag, nigga!

1935
01:19:32,733 --> 01:19:34,900
Hey, hey, hey!
You big beanbag-build bitch!

1936
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:37,503
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
stop it! You all friends!

1937
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:39,472
Right?

1938
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,607
Now, Jojo,
you might be right.

1939
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,476
A strip club
<i>isn't</i> a home office.

1940
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:45,277
You're askin'
to be audited, son.

1941
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,280
But is being right more
important than friendship?

1942
01:19:48,282 --> 01:19:50,015
Huh?

1943
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:53,819
Take it from me.
I lost my black friend.

1944
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:55,754
Don't lose yours.

1945
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:57,356
Hug.

1946
01:19:57,358 --> 01:20:00,159
Hug, motherfuckas!

1947
01:20:01,457 --> 01:20:02,828
I'm sorry.

1948
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,097
I'm sorry, man.
I'll love you forever.

1949
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:07,933
Hey, bro, you
know, it's just talk.

1950
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,102
Say, cuz, you ready to get put
on the hood?

1951
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:11,704

Mayo...

1956
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,347
I need you to sink
your mind into this, cuz.

1957
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,682
Once you step through
this threshold,

1958
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:26,552
motherfuckers are ready
to kill for you.

1959
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:29,822
I mean a whole fraternity
of motherfuckers

1960
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:31,190
gonna have your back.

1961
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:34,226
But there's only one way
outta this.

1962
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:37,830
That's when your casket
drops into the ground.

1963
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:40,032
So from this day forward,

1964
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:41,700
you have eternal protection

1965
01:20:41,702 --> 01:20:44,703
until your eternal demise.

1966
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:48,073
We dead-ass serious
about what we do.

1967
01:20:48,075 --> 01:20:50,242
And if you go through
that threshold

1968
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:51,544
and you make it back,

1969
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,013
we gonna be dead-ass serious
about you.

1970
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,015
Time to smoke some fools.

1971
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,084
Crenshaw Kings for life,
motherfucker.

1972
01:20:59,086 --> 01:21:00,819
Hmm. Almost.

1973
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:02,955
Let's roll.

1974
01:21:05,158 --> 01:21:06,692
Hey.

1975
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:08,327
You come back safe.

1976
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:09,662
I will, Shonda.

1977
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,032
We gotta go, Mayo.

1978
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,199
Bye, baby.

1979
01:21:14,201 --> 01:21:16,201
Let's roll, cuz.

1980
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,104
Ho! Hold up!

1981
01:21:19,106 --> 01:21:20,406
Oh, shit!
Wait, wait, wait!

1982
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,775
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!

1983
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:24,910
It's Darnell!
It's Darnell!

1984
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:26,211
It's Darnell!

1985
01:21:26,213 --> 01:21:27,880
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

1986
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:30,249
Shit, cousin! Man, tell 'em
to put their guns down!

1987
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:32,117
Man, put 'em up.

1988
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:35,187
God!

1989
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:37,890
What is your problem, man?
What are you doin'?

1990
01:21:37,892 --> 01:21:39,291
Man, give us a second.

1991
01:21:39,293 --> 01:21:41,460
I'm bloodin' in.

1992
01:21:41,462 --> 01:21:43,629
Crenshaw Kings are gonna protect
me on the inside.

1993
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:45,965
So you're gonna go
and kill somebody, James?

1994
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,766
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

1995
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:49,343
I have to.
I don't have a choice.

1996
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,008
That is not true.

1997
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:55,040
I came here to tell you...
We can clear your name, James.

1998
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:56,909
But you gotta
trust me, man.

1999
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:59,278
We gotta roll, Mayo.

2000
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,780
"Mayo"?
Who... who the fuck is Mayo?

2001
01:22:01,782 --> 01:22:03,983
I'm Mayo.
It's my gang name.

2002
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:07,119
It's short for "mayonnaise,"
on account of my skin color.

2003
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:08,487
I came up with that.

2004
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:10,823
Okay, you wanna go, then?
What?

2005
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,591
You wanna go?
What are you doing?

2006
01:22:12,593 --> 01:22:14,948
What are you doing?
Putting fingerprints all on your gun.

2007
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:17,221
That way, if you go to jail,
I'm goin' to jail wit' you.

2008
01:22:17,246 --> 01:22:19,666
So before you go out there
and make a stupid-ass decision,

2009
01:22:19,691 --> 01:22:21,073
why don't you
think about that?

2010
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:23,802
Yeah. There you go.

2011
01:22:23,804 --> 01:22:25,237
That's... that's it?

2012
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:26,805
My fingerprints are off
that easy?

2013
01:22:26,807 --> 01:22:28,007
Yeah, pretty much.
Good as new.

2014
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,742
Let's roll, Mayo.

2015
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:31,443
James, you got a choice
right now.

2016
01:22:31,445 --> 01:22:33,746
You got the right path,
you got the wrong path.

2017
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,347
Make the right decision,
James.

2018
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:37,249
Follow your heart, man.

2019
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:41,253
James, you gotta trust me
on this one.

2020
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:51,430
Oh, my God!
I almost did it!

2021
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:52,831
I almost killed a man!

2022
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,667
And I was gonna use
this gun.

2023
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:56,335
Hey, James,
put that away, man!

2024
01:22:56,337 --> 01:22:57,436
Stop!

2025
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:01,340
What is your problem?

2026
01:23:01,342 --> 01:23:02,641
I don't know.

2027
01:23:02,643 --> 01:23:05,044
They just... they were
just encouraging me,

2028
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,046
and they were
high-fiving me.

2029
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:09,214
They're passing me
this sticky icky.

2030
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:11,950
And between the pot
and the hos...

2031
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:14,422
It was just an ambrosia
of primal sensations.

2032
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:18,534
And for one brief moment,
I knew what my purpose was.

2033
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:20,826
Okay, okay.
Not to mention Russell.

2034
01:23:20,828 --> 01:23:23,295
He's so charismatic.
Real natural leader.

2035
01:23:23,297 --> 01:23:25,531
Reminds me of a young
Ronald Reagan.

2036
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,466
Hey.

2037
01:23:27,468 --> 01:23:30,636
Thank you for coming back
for me.

2038
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:34,540
Thanks for not doin'
nothin' stupid, man.

2039
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:35,574
Let's get out of here.

2040
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,254
All right, so listen to this.

2041
01:23:49,256 --> 01:23:51,757
I figured out that the residue
on Martin's car was saltwater.

2042
01:23:51,759 --> 01:23:53,358
Then I remembered
the mileage.

2043
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,893
Reason being,
I used to take a picture

2044
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:56,361
of the odometer all the time

2045
01:23:56,363 --> 01:23:58,198
to keep people from accusing me
of joyridin'.

2046
01:23:58,223 --> 01:23:59,448
People do that?
That's awful.

2047
01:23:59,473 --> 01:24:00,833
Yeah, you did it
like three times.

2048
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:02,101
You tried to get me fired,

2049
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:03,869
but you thought my name
was Andre.

2050
01:24:03,871 --> 01:24:05,604
Anyway, look:
Martin used to drive

2051
01:24:05,606 --> 01:24:07,506
the same exact seven Miles
every day.

2052
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:10,042
But last week, he started
driving 56 Miles every day.

2053
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:11,543
56!

2054
01:24:11,545 --> 01:24:13,203
So, what I did was,
I checked the map.

2055
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:15,214
Turns out
that's the exact distance

2056
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,082
of a round trip
to San Pedro.

2057
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:18,917
Saltwater,
ocean, San Pedro.

2058
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:21,222
I just gotta figure out
why he's going to San Pedro.

2059
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:22,728
That's the only thing
I don't know.

2060
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:24,256
His yacht.

2061
01:24:24,797 --> 01:24:25,958
It's docked at the port.

2062
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:28,193
Fucker's got a yacht?
Mm-hmm.

2063
01:24:28,195 --> 01:24:29,528
And an island in Cape Verde,

2064
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,063
where there are no
extradition laws.

2065
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:33,398
Fucker's got a yacht
and a island, James?

2066
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,901
Fucking working for a villain
in a James Bond movie!

2067
01:24:35,903 --> 01:24:38,937
He's gonna make a run
for it.

2068
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:40,775
Not if Mayo can stop him.

2069
01:24:41,814 --> 01:24:45,477
Mayo and chocolat.

2070
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:47,146
"Chocolat"?
Chocolat.

2071
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:49,414
Is that... is that supposed
to be my nickname?

2072
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:50,816
That's your nickname.

2073
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:55,754
I'll do better.
We have the whole car ride.

2074
01:24:55,756 --> 01:24:57,923
Mayo and... Coffee.

2075
01:24:57,925 --> 01:24:59,658
Mayo and fudge.

2076
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,326
I don't want one.
Just call me Darnell.

2077
01:25:01,328 --> 01:25:03,695
Hit it, fudge!

2078
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,407
There it is.
There's his boat.

2079
01:25:15,409 --> 01:25:17,142
The<i> Sea Note.</i>

2080
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:20,679
The<i> Sea Note?</i>
What a dick.

2081
01:25:21,274 --> 01:25:22,808
Come on.

2082
01:25:24,017 --> 01:25:26,685
Get down, James.
You gotta get down.

2083
01:25:27,828 --> 01:25:29,488
Are those guards?

2084
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:31,957
I think so.
There's a lot of 'em.

2085
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:34,959
Yeah.
Oh, there's the computer.

2086
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:36,995
I see it.

2087
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:41,667
James, you gotta get low!

2088
01:25:48,474 --> 01:25:50,309
Oh, no.
They're gettin' ready to leave.

2089
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,444
Shit.
We gotta jump.

2090
01:25:52,446 --> 01:25:53,679
All right.

2091
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,781
What are you...
Get off my hand!

2092
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,749
Sorry, I'm nervous.
Let's go!

2093
01:26:01,521 --> 01:26:03,455
Aah! Ohh.

2094
01:26:03,457 --> 01:26:05,824
Darnell!
I made it!

2095
01:26:05,826 --> 01:26:07,192
Ohh!

2096
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:13,498
Let go of my face!

2097
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,167
That's all you, James.

2098
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:18,070
All you, James!

2099
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:43,295
Okay.
Come on, this way.

2100
01:26:48,534 --> 01:26:52,237
Ah! There it is.
Come on.

2101
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,072
Let's go.
Let's go.

2102
01:26:54,074 --> 01:26:56,108
Oh, shit!

2103
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,046
Get off!
Get off!

2104
01:27:01,048 --> 01:27:04,116
Get off!

2105
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,918
Damn it.

2106
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,420
This is the end, guys.

2107
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:10,088
You going down.

2108
01:27:11,168 --> 01:27:12,357
That's great.

2109
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:13,892
I spend my whole life
in Crenshaw,

2110
01:27:13,894 --> 01:27:15,260
and now I'm about
to get killed

2111
01:27:15,262 --> 01:27:16,895
by some white guy
from Beverly Hills?

2112
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:18,096
On a yacht!

2113
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:19,564
I'm so sorry.

2114
01:27:19,566 --> 01:27:21,233
Hand over the computer,
James.

2115
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:23,535
Come on. Just can't get it
through your head, hmm?

2116
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:26,238
Guys like you will always be
the fall guy 'cause you're weak.

2117
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:34,279
Are you... are you okay?

2118
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:35,981
James? James?

2119
01:27:35,983 --> 01:27:38,283
No. James, please.
Goddamn, James.

2120
01:27:38,285 --> 01:27:40,085
Please,<i> please,</i> James.

2121
01:27:40,087 --> 01:27:43,488
I sentence you to ten years
in a maximum security prison.

2122
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,957
You about to get this:

2123
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,458
Oh, they be fuckin'
in San Quentin.

2124
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,960
John Mayer in this house?

2125
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:49,461
Mouth full of balls.

2126
01:27:49,463 --> 01:27:50,896
Come back, Mayo.
Take it all.

2127
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,397
When life puts a dick
in your mouth,

2128
01:27:52,422 --> 01:27:53,809
you make dickade.

2129
01:27:53,834 --> 01:27:55,100
Go suck a dick.

2130
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:57,402
Your Capoeira's strong!

2131
01:27:57,404 --> 01:27:59,638
Now you must bring your power
into the world.

2132
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:06,678
What? James.
What are you doin'?

2133
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,580
I've been pushed around
for too long.

2134
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:11,283
Now it is time.
I can feel it.

2135
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:12,584
Time for what, James?

2136
01:28:12,586 --> 01:28:14,519
Protect the computer!
Oh, shit!

2137
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:16,088
I don't want the computer!

2138
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,723
Bencao kick!
What?

2139
01:28:20,827 --> 01:28:23,762
Ataque!

2140
01:28:25,499 --> 01:28:27,833
Oh, God!

2141
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,208
Leave me alone!
Stop! No!

2142
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:39,211
James! James!

2143
01:28:42,516 --> 01:28:44,516
Tudo bem!

2144
01:28:51,358 --> 01:28:53,358
All right, get down there.
Come on.

2145
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,395
Tudo bem!

2146
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:04,903
Axé!

2147
01:29:05,692 --> 01:29:09,007
Mayo and chocolat,
motherfuckers!

2148
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:11,843
James, you mean to tell me

2149
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:13,578
you could do this shit
the whole time?

2150
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,949
Capoeira must never be used
unless Capoeira is required.

2151
01:29:15,974 --> 01:29:17,140
Let's go.

2152
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:21,386
Motherfuckers!

2153
01:29:21,388 --> 01:29:25,390
Okay!
Okay!

2154
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:28,326
Beleza!

2155
01:29:28,328 --> 01:29:30,162
Come here!

2156
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:33,398
That's what we do!

2157
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,301
Mother... get off!

2158
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,071
James.

2159
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,073
Do like we used to do
in the yard.

2160
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:44,276
Yeah!

2161
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,912
You got it, James.
Fuck yeah, James.

2162
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:48,780
Get his ass, James.

2163
01:29:55,955 --> 01:29:58,790
God.

2164
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:01,093
I got the computer.

2165
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,095
Lifeboat. Come on.
All right.

2166
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:05,297
Hey, that Capoeira shit
was amazing.

2167
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,933
But you learned some-a
that shit from me too.

2168
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:10,068
Right, James?
What's goin' on here?

2169
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,937
What the hell did you do
to my boat?

2170
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:13,271
Man, fuck this boat!

2171
01:30:13,273 --> 01:30:14,873
We taking the evidence
that you framed

2172
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,708
your son-in-law with,
you sick son of a bitch.

2173
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:18,543
How could you do this
to me, Martin?

2174
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:19,578
Ten years in prison?!

2175
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,046
James, you realize

2176
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,343
that I didn't mean
to hurt you.

2177
01:30:22,368 --> 01:30:23,615
I'm very fond of you,

2178
01:30:23,617 --> 01:30:25,450
but Himalayan Tiger tanked

2179
01:30:25,452 --> 01:30:27,327
and I had to get the money
from somewhere.

2180
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:29,054
I had no choice.
It was you or me.

2181
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,489
That sounds like a choice!

2182
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:33,592
James, fuck him.
We're leaving.

2183
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,229
And next time you wanna store
some fraud shit, get an iPad.

2184
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:39,731
Come on, James.

2185
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:40,932
Oh, my damn.

2186
01:30:40,934 --> 01:30:42,801
Alissa.
James!

2187
01:30:42,803 --> 01:30:44,469
Daddy, what's he doing here?

2188
01:30:44,471 --> 01:30:45,437
It's fine, honey.

2189
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:46,771
Uh, James.

2190
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:48,507
I have a wonderful idea.

2191
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:50,742
Why don't you come with us.

2192
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:53,512
We'll start a whole new life
in Cape Verde,

2193
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:54,946
and nobody has to go to prison.

2194
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:56,281
Don't you want...

2195
01:30:56,283 --> 01:31:00,152
A big, big island?

2196
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,521
Were you in on this?

2197
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:03,755
No, not at first.

2198
01:31:03,757 --> 01:31:05,790
And when he told me about it,

2199
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,325
I was really mad at him.

2200
01:31:07,327 --> 01:31:08,827
But then he explained
how he was

2201
01:31:08,829 --> 01:31:10,634
able to hide most
of the money, so, really,

2202
01:31:10,659 --> 01:31:12,030
there's no harm done.

2203
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:14,432
James, now, there's still time

2204
01:31:14,434 --> 01:31:16,701
to get everything you want.

2205
01:31:16,703 --> 01:31:19,204
Everything.

2206
01:31:19,206 --> 01:31:20,305
No!

2207
01:31:20,307 --> 01:31:22,507
I don't want any of it.

2208
01:31:22,509 --> 01:31:24,876
And you got a white girl's ass.

2209
01:31:25,879 --> 01:31:27,279
Thattaboy.

2210
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:28,980
Hey, James, do you wanna
switch off, man?

2211
01:31:28,982 --> 01:31:30,348
I got nothin' left up top.

2212
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:33,518
Quick, throw it in the Zodiac.

2213
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,221
Right. Then we can get the fuck
outta here.

2214
01:31:36,223 --> 01:31:38,723
Shit!

2215
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:42,060
Goddamn it!

2216
01:31:42,062 --> 01:31:44,796
I am genuinely sorry it had
to end this way.

2217
01:31:44,798 --> 01:31:47,299
When we clear the breakwater,
shoot 'em.

2218
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:49,367
You ain't got to do this, man.

2219
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:50,869
You ain't got to do this.

2220
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:52,537
Well, Dad,

2221
01:31:52,539 --> 01:31:55,640
looks like you thought of
everything, didn't you?

2222
01:31:55,642 --> 01:31:57,509
You were always
one step ahead of me.

2223
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:01,746
Except you forgot
one little detail.

2224
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:07,886
Where'd that come from?

2225
01:32:07,888 --> 01:32:10,522
First rule
in prison pat-downs:

2226
01:32:10,524 --> 01:32:12,324
Always check the anus.

2227
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:15,260
Someone learned how to keister.

2228
01:32:15,262 --> 01:32:16,194
Ew.

2229
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:17,262
That's right.

2230
01:32:17,264 --> 01:32:18,997
Nuts and butts.

2231
01:32:18,999 --> 01:32:22,701
You point? Okay.
That's how you wanna do it?

2232
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,502
You point at him.
I'll point at Martin.

2233
01:32:24,504 --> 01:32:26,438
Either way.
So if I die, Martin's goin'.

2234
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,407
So you figure it out.
Shoot me, Martin gets shot.

2235
01:32:29,409 --> 01:32:31,443
You're gonna...
Ball's in your court, Gayle.

2236
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:33,845
Alissa? Huh?
Shoot her.

2237
01:32:33,847 --> 01:32:36,248
Sh-shoot her. You need to shoot
that bitch anyway.

2238
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,582
You're not gonna shoot me.

2239
01:32:37,584 --> 01:32:39,084
You're wasting time.

2240
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,052
Police'll be here any second.
That's right.

2241
01:32:41,054 --> 01:32:42,687
We're talkin' the real police.

2242
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:44,856
The ones that's gonna

Uh-huh.

2244
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:47,559
That's got dogs that can swim.

2245
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:49,461
Let me tell you somethin'
about swimmin' dogs.

2246
01:32:49,463 --> 01:32:51,710
Now, let me tell ya, you're

2247
01:32:51,749 --> 01:32:53,365

plausible.

2250
01:32:58,138 --> 01:33:00,972
Yes!

2251
01:33:00,974 --> 01:33:02,207
Hell yeah.

2252
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,276
Oh, shit.

2253
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:05,877
How?

2254
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:07,312
Remember this bracelet

2255
01:33:07,314 --> 01:33:09,781
that crooked lawyer of yours
gave me?

2256
01:33:09,783 --> 01:33:13,451
By my calculation we should be
well outside the county line.

2257
01:33:13,453 --> 01:33:16,488
Prison school's in
session, bitch.

2258
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:19,391
And somebody
just graduated.

2259
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,092
That's perfect.
That's perfect.

2260
01:33:21,094 --> 01:33:22,494

Yeah, where you goin?

2264
01:33:27,834 --> 01:33:30,402
Huh, Martin? What?!
Look at you, man!

2265
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,637
I know.
God, look at you!

2266
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,939
Where did you put...
That was in your ass.

2267
01:33:34,941 --> 01:33:36,408
Yep.
That was in your ass.

2268
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,010
The computer proved
I was innocent.

2269
01:33:39,012 --> 01:33:41,846
Martin was arrested for fraud,
tampering with evidence,

2270
01:33:41,848 --> 01:33:43,281
and obstruction of justice.

2271
01:33:43,283 --> 01:33:46,318
And I will be contacting
my attorney. Daddy?

2272
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,653
As for me, I was cleared
of all charges

2273
01:33:48,655 --> 01:33:50,288
related to the embezzlement.

2274
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:51,856
So I guess we did it.

2275
01:33:51,858 --> 01:33:53,658
Mayo and chocolate.

2276
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:57,523
Thank God we won't be needin'
<i>this</i> anymore.

2277
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:58,863
This illegal, unlicensed gun.

2278
01:33:58,865 --> 01:34:01,539
Okay, James. You know, you should
really get rid of that thing.

2279
01:34:01,564 --> 01:34:03,301
- Gun!
- Drop it!

2280
01:34:03,303 --> 01:34:05,537
Oh, shit.
Uh...

2281
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,472
I did end up getting six months

2282
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:09,774
for carrying an
unlicensed weapon.

2283
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:14,212
But, thanks to Darnell,
I was ready.

2284
01:34:16,549 --> 01:34:18,783
Martin didn't do as well.

2285
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:21,519
But he learned
a valuable lesson, too.

2286
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:24,522
