So high school.

153

Right. The whole idea
of waiting until August...

Yeah, I agree.

161

- No talking.
- I guess, um...

162
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,079
maybe we could text?

163
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,747
Occasional texts. Okay.

164
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,457

Um...

166

What if one of us starts seeing someone?

167
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,341
- [chuckles]
- I don't have anyone in mind. I...

168
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,887
Alec, I just think we respected each other
when we were together, so

169
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,515
we should respect each other
when we're apart.

170
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,726
- I mean, we've been together two years.
- Mmm.

[laugh awkwardly]

182
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,626
Thank you, Mason.

183
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,723
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

184
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,100
[laughs] For sure.

185
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,518
Hey, Juicebox.

186
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,021
- Uh, no.
- So, I'm Foster.

187
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,148
- And I just wanted to say...
- No, means no!

188
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,441
Foster.

189
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,736
All right. [laughs]

190
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,906
How you doin'?

191
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,917
[laughs]

192
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,710
Paige Wilcox.

193
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,712
She checks all the right boxes.

194
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,381
- Is she on your list?
- Didn't even bother.

195
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,925
I'm not worthy.

196
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,259
[sparkling bells]

197
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,312
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey, how are you?

198
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,231
Good. I heard about you and Erin.

199
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:44,941
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm Foster.

200
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,400
Mm-hmm. Um...

201
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,902
[Paige] Do you...

202
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,737
Do you wanna hang out?

203
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,448
I... Yeah. Sure.

204
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,741
- [Alec] Um...
- Now?

205
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,910
Can I just pretend I went to college

206
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,787
and then backpack around Europe instead?

207
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,957
Do people really fact-check resumes?

208
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,209
I feel like that's very time-intensive.

209
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,127
You don't really want to do that.

210
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,380
I'm not saying
I'm gonna put an Ivy League.

211
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,675
Although I could put Harvard
and just test the waters.

212
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,843
I feel like it's easy to pretend
you went to Harvard.

213
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,887
You just have to bring it up a lot.

214
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,305
[Alec] Oh! Look out!

215
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,100
[laughs]

216
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,060
[laugh] Sorry!

217
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,062
- [Alex] Bring it back in there.
- [Paige] It's hard. I drink beer,

218
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,105
- [Paige] I don't play with it.
- [laughs]

219
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,731
[Erin] That was quick!

220
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,941
[laughs]

221
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,067
[sighs]

222
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,277
- Come on.
- [scoffs]

223
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:30,903
Fishnets?

224
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
Wait, you're...

225
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,037
Griffin.

226
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,747
Right. How are you?

227
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,707
Great.

228
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,251
Normal.

229
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,919
Actually, I...

230
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,337
[Mason] Whoa! Too thirsty, bro.

231
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,881
He's great, Phoebe. [laughs]

232
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,551
You know, we were actually
just catching up.

233
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,929
You know, Griffin here, he definitely
wants to be interviewed.

234
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,888
Oh, really?

235
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,223
- [Mason] Yeah!
- [Griffin] Mm-mm.

236
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,766
No. I don't remember saying that.

237
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,059
[Phoebe] No, that would be great.

238
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,645
Have a different perspective.
You left for high school, right?

239
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,148
- Yes, he did.
- Yeah, I did.

240
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,442
Cool, we'll reach out. When you're free.

241
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,110
- It's Phoebe...
- Fisher.

242
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,196
Right. Thanks.

243
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,826
- You know her name is Phoebe Fisher.
- Blow me.

244
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,994
[laughs]

245
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,997
[Lilah's mom] So the woman at the agency
said you have a car,

246
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,793
which is important because I'll need you
to drive Lilah to and from auditions.

247
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,128
Auditions?

248
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,964
Well, Lilah has been modeling and acting
for some time now.

249
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,051
You know what they say,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

250
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,470
I was a child actor when I was younger.

251
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,680
Bit of theater, commercial work,

252
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,807
and I was in a pretty well-known movie.

253
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,393
<i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

254
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,355
Wow, that's... cool.

255
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,606
Lilah,

256
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,068
this is Audrey. She's gonna
be helping us out this summer.

257
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,069
Hm.

258
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,029
I'll let you two get to know each other.

259
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,162
So...

260
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,794
So your mom tells me
you're quite the actress.

261
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,420
It's a challenging endeavor.

262
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,297
I'm just trying to hone my craft.

263
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,301
Ooo. [sighs]

264
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,556
So who's the next lucky lady on the list?

265
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,851
[sighs]

266
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,815
- Christine Purdy?
- [Foster] Mm-hmm.

267
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,650
You planning to attend Bible study now?

268
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
She's probably a virgin.

269
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,654
It would be my honor.

270
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,697
[laughs]

271
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,615
- [tire squealing]
- [Alec] Woe!

272
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,533
[Foster] Oh!

273
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey!

274
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,494
Grad gift! What do you think?

275
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,745
Oh, man, this is...

276
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,247
this is amazing.

277
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,666
Right? I mean, it was this or double D's,

278
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,001
but I think I made the right choice.
My boobs already rock.

279
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,046
Oh! Beach bonfire party. Are you down?

280
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,716
I... sure. Yeah.

281
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,718
Okay. I will text you the info.

282
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,177
And I will see you tonight.

283
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,929
- [engine starts]
- [Paige] Bye, boys.

284
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,014
[engine roars]

285
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,309
Does she have a sister?

286
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,686
[tire squealing]

287
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,313
Mom?

288
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,440
[Griffin] <i>I don't know.</i>

289
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,151
<i>I feel that we have
such an opportunity in this...</i>

290
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,113
<i>really connected world
to get to know each other.</i>

291
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,199
<i>Maybe even wipe away some hatred
based on stereotypes.</i>

292
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,244
And what do we have to show for it?

293
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,204
Snap streaks.

294
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,083
Makes me wanna throw my phone
in Lake Michigan. [laughs]

295
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,420
Okay. Final question.

296
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,592
Name the one thing you wanna accomplish
during your college experience.

297
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,511
Yep.

298
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,473
To never have my stomach pumped?

299
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,432
[laughs]

300
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,811
Okay. I think we have it. [laughs]

301
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,398
I feel like that was
utterly unremarkable.

302
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,649
You did great.

303
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,319
[whispering] You should have seen
some of the others.

304
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,072
Ah, nice setup.

305
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,115
Yeah.

306
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,410
[Phoebe] One of my teachers knows
the guy who owns the studio.

307
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,580
[Phoebe] And I could do a lot of it
on my laptop, but

308
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,082
this place has full-on effects,

309
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,584
sound mixing...

310
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,880
I don't really know how to do
some of the techy stuff. [sighs]

311
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,007
Especially the audio.

312
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,801
ProTools, huh?

313
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,303
Yeah. Not my friend.

314
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,597
[chuckles] Here.

315
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,057
[Griffin] So you have automation here.

316
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,851
[Griffin] Gotta delete that
and bring down the track.

317
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,936
[mouse clicks]

318
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,979
How does everyone knows
how to do this except for me?

319
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,106
[chuckles] Well, I don't know
about everyone else,

320
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,025
but I've been recording stuff
since I was a kid.

321
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,445
Do you need anything else?

322
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,241
So you're shooting
your film for SC, right?

323
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,367
What?

324
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,077
USC? Film school?

325
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
- Mason said you were...
- No. NYU.

326
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,164
In New York?

327
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,000
NYU of New York. Yes.

328
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,629
Um... I'm not doing it for them.
It's for a festival this summer.

329
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,716
NYU, huh? Lady Gaga.

330
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,010
Oh, please. Did she even graduate?

331
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,971
I can play that game.

332
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,056
Okay. Actors...

333
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,558
Ethan Hawke,

334
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,477
Billy Crudup, Miles Teller.

335
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,188
- It's okay.
- You prefer directors?

336
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,439
- I do.
- Okay.

337
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,816
Um...

338
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,529
Spike Lee, Oliver Stone,

339
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,489
Martin Scorsese.

340
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,615
- Okay.
- [laughs]

341
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,243
Wait, where are you going?

342
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,453
Columbia.

343
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,331
So, we're both in New York.

344
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,708
Yeah.

345
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,544
Columbia.

346
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,088
James Franco...

347
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,550
[laughs] Well, not that I'm that crazy
about Columbia, but...

348
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,554
if I were to attend an alumni mixer,
I may run into Alicia Keys,

349
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,513
Jake Gyllenhaal.

350
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,850
Yeah, no big deal.
And then maybe grab a beer with

351
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,643
Teddy Roosevelt, Barack Obama...

352
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,313
- I don't know, Gandhi?
- [laughs]

353
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,439
Strong finish.

354
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,781
Well...

355
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,827
Um, thank you so much
for the interview and the...

356
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,579
audio expertise.

357
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,081
Yeah, no problem. Anytime.

358
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,043
Right.

359
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,837

[cell beeps]

534
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:21,895
Damn it!

535
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,282
Crap!

536
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:36,868
It was going great.

537
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,663
It was going great,
and I started getting cocky.

538
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,249
I got cocky, started cracking jokes
that clearly didn't make sense

539
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,792
and I made it awkward!

540
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,630
[sighs]

541
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:50,966
[cell beeps]

542
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,759
It's her!

543
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:53,927
It's her!

544
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,889
[sighs]

545
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,558
[laughs]

546
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,520
Probably just poor reception.

547
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,855
[car engine roars]

548
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,109
[Chad] Remind me again why I am invited
to your sister's rehearsal dinner?

549
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,860
Well, she was your first babysitter.

550
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,320
And she gave you baths.

551
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,739
So she has an intimate knowledge
of your penis.

552
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,409
Terrific. Well, I can't wait to bond
with her new husband over that.

553
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,077
Aw.

554
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,038
We're early,
and the catering's gonna suck.

555
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,208
- Oh! Wanna grab a bite?
- Sure.

556
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,589
Two buck longnecks, half-priced wells
till 6:00, guys. What'll it be?

557
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,260
Uh... Well... Yeah, I guess...

558
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,679
- Long neck.
- Preference?

559
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,598
Surprise me?

560
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,475
Yeah. Good for me.

561
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,518
Gotcha.

562
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,021
I almost forgot...

563
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,987
We're doing 10 dollar buckets.

564
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,865
Great deal, Tracy.

565
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,534
- Bucket it is.
- You got it, sweetheart.

566
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,370
She didn't card us!

567
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,372
I've no idea what we just ordered.

568
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,458
It's the suits! The ties!

569
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,460
We look like everyone else in here.

570
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,253
[Chad] You mean like businessmen!

571
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,256
- No!
- Yeah...

572
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,385
Crazy day at the CBOE, huh, guys?

573
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,595
[groans]

574
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,306
So crazy. Yeah!

575
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,766
How did you know?

576
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,392
Most of other traders are already drunk.

577
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,603
Well, I guess we got
some catching up to do.

578
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,772
To our new friend, Tracy.

579
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,649
You guys are sweet!

580
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,905
[Christine] Why is it okay
that everyone else can have a thing like

581
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,574
a capella or tattoo sleeves,

582
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,327
but I'm an outcast at school
because my thing

583
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,745
is Jesus?

584
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,331
I mean...
I feel like I can't even say "Jesus"

585
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,041
without making people uncomfortable.

586
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,626
Jesus!

587
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,586
- Jesus!
- Right.

588
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,590
Like when I suggested a Bible study
to the guys I bodybuild with,

589
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,967
they laughed at me.

590
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,595
You're a Christian bodybuilder?

591
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,430
You never told me that.

592
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,348
I dabble.

593
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,432
[laughs]

594
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,518
Let's all pray.

595
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,312
Dear Lord,

596
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,692
we thank you for the opportunity
to break bread and share your bounty.

597
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,820
And we welcome my newest friend, Foster,

598
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,948
who has been a beacon of hope for me

599
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,326
amid the confusion
and darkness of adolescence.

600
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,162
- [Christine] We search...
- [boy] Dude, go home.

601
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,414
You got no shot.

602
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,333
I'm here for Jesus.

603
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,085
Seriously. Give up.

604
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,920
What do you know?

605
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:34,879
Man to man?

606
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,716
Telling ya. She doesn't even kiss.

607
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,426
[smacks]

608
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,224
- [man] <i>What the...</i>
- [Walter] <i>Have they called yet?</i>

609
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,435
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

610
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,103
<i>My dirty undies, dude.</i>

611
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,396
<i>Laundry. The whites.</i>

612
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,856
- [laughs]
- [man] <i>Walter,</i>

613
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,650
<i>I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.</i>

614
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,820
[Walter] <i>That's right, dude. The white.</i>
<i>The ringer could not look empty.</i>

615
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,406
[Griffin] How have you not seen
<i>The Big Lebowski?</i>

616
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,366
[Phoebe] The Dude abides.

617
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,077
[Griffin] It's impossible to go wrong
with the Coen brothers.

618
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,704
<i>Fargo?</i>

619
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,039
<i>- No Country For Old Men? Blood Simple?</i>
- [chuckles]

620
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,500
You're so full of it right now.

621
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,295
Your IMDB app is literally exploding.

622
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,714
I'm sorry, IMDB?

623
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,466
[European accent] What is this
you speak of?

624
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,925
[laughs] No, what accent is that?

625
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,135
Like, Dracula?

626
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,470
- No.
- Let me see your phone.

627
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,263
- Hey. No, hey!
- Let me see it.

628
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,681
Hey! No! You're in... Hey! Stop!

629
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,100
You're invading
my personal bubble here, okay?

630
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,728
[Phoebe throat]

631
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,439
Do you wanna get some food or something?

632
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,692
I'm sorry, I promised my mom.

633
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,360
She ordered Chinese.

634
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,737
No, it's cool.

635
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,072
I didn't mean to cross over into,

636
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,325
you know, official date territory.

637
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,077
Not that it would have been our first,
by the way.

638
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,414
Eighth grade. Bladeland.

639
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,501
Yeah. You may recall it was retro night.

640
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,753
That's right. With the four wheel skates.

641
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,588
- And the disco ball.
- [laughs]

642
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,507
Remember they had that couple skate?

643
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,551
And they played, like, a cheesy slow song
and we had to do a lap.

644
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,638
Well, yeah, we did two so I could work up
the courage to hold your hand.

645
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,931
Did you?

646
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,809
No. You would have remembered,
I'm quite the interlacer.

647
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,353
I probably would have taken us both down.

648
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,855
I would have cushioned your fall.

649
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
Aw.

650
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,234
Then you left for school.

651
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,112
Yeah. Came home for Thanksgiving
and it's like the whole world here

652
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,280
had changed.

653
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,782
The abyss of high school.

654
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,584
This is me.

655
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,130
I had fun tonight. Thank you.

656
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,465
Sure.

657
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,593
- Night.
- Night.

658
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,312
So, do you have a boyfriend?

659
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,064
I used to.

660
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,608
This guy named Tyler.

661
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,611
He was kind of a slacker.

662
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,447
Netflix and chill is like
his life mantra.

663
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,241
So why did you date him?

664
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,577
I don't know.

665
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,079
My friend Erin wanted me to date him.

666
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,040
And he wasn't, like, the worst option,
so I guess he was okay.

667
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,669
Why would you settle for a boy
who's just okay?

668
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,297
I don't know.

669
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,716
Nobody has ever asked me that before.

670
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,384
[laughs]

671
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,973
I always get the biscuits and gravy.

672
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,601
- Even for dinner time.
- [Erin laughs]

673
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,768
Thanks.

674
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,730
So, do you bring
all your first dates here?

675
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,733
Oh, only the ones I land on.

676
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,111
No, this place reminds me of home.

677
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,404
But never for a date.

678
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,239
Mmm, where's home?

679
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,908
Falls City, Texas.

680
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,536
Couple thousand people.
I actually grew up on a ranch.

681
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,122
Wow. [laughs]
Big change, huh?

682
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,041
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Erin laughs]

683
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:04,339
Shouldn't you be, like, out with your
teammates getting drunk with groupies?

684
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,174
Shoot, am I late for that already?

685
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,675
Um...

686
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,802
No, I've...

687
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,721
I have an opportunity here

688
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,097
and I don't wanna blow it.

689
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,516
My parents sacrificed a lot.

690
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,770
And I kind of owe it to them
to take this seriously.

691
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,023
You're making it very hard to judge you.

692
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,691
[laughs]

693
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,776
You wanted to judge me?

694
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,321
Not wanted, but expected... yeah.

695
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,491
I mean, come on.
It's no secret how ball players are.

696
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,700
Not a newsflash.

697
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,119
Oh, yeah. No, you're right.

698
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,374
Um... Most of my teammates
are set, you know?

699
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,751
And I am still playing off of
my minor league contract,

700
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,878
so it's just... different.

701
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,881
[inhales] Plus, drunk groupies...

702
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,091
not my idea of fun.

703
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,760
Well, what is your idea of fun?

704
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,057
[laughs]

705
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,372
[sighs]

706
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,540
[scoffs]

707
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,083
Honey baby,

708
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,836
are you almost done?
It's like 2,000 degrees out.

709
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,963
- Last coat.
- "Honey baby"?

710

00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,428
Saw the bloodbath in the market
today, guys. These are on me.

1057
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,223
Hey, T, what's the scoop
on those two over there?

1058
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,725
Janet and Claire. Advertising, I think.

1059
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,019
- Mmm.
- Oh, God. They saw me.

1060
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,312
Probably think I'm a stalker.

1061
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,731
It's no big of a deal. You'll be fine,
just be cool, hey, breathe.

1062
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,358
- [inhales]
- Ooo.

1063
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,400
Breathe with me.

1064
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,111
[heavy inhale and exhale]

1065
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,822
- Here you go, buddy. Oh, they're here.
- Okay.

1066
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,324
Mind if we join you guys?

1067
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,201
Absolutely. Have a seat!

1068
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,661
[chuckles]

1069
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,037
[clears throat] So...

1070
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,915
I'm Reece, this is Chad...

1071
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,333
- Mm-hmm.
- [clears throat]

1072
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,502
- So what brings you lovely ladies...
- Reece?

1073
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,878
Chad?

1074
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,966
How about we cut the shit
and order some shots?

1075
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,185
[knocking on door]

1076
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,649
[Phoebe's mom] Hi, Griffin!

1077
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,692
I'm Phoebe's mom.

1078
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,902
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Come on in.

1079
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,201
Hey, hi, yeah...

1080
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,453
Nice to meet you... too. [inhales]

1081
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,219
[Phoebe's mom] Can I get you anything?

1082
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,765
I'm good. Thanks.

1083
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,852
You sure about that?
That was a pretty long "um".

1084
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,520
We have soda, water...

1085
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,647
I'm... really, I'm fine.

1086
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,357
[Phoebe] Hey!

1087
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,819
- So you guys finally met?
- And I look like this.

1088
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,821
[Phoebe's mom] I just got back
from the gym.

1089
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,866
I'm not surprised...
with your exciting dating life.

1090
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,284
She's never home anymore.

1091
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,536
I feel like she's the teenager
and I'm the mom.

1092
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,914
- My exciting dating life.
- [Phoebe] No, I love it!

1093
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,042
[Phoebe] This guy might actually
be a keeper.

1094
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,003
Anyway, honey, Griffin doesn't care
about any of this.

1095
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,255
No.

1096
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,886
Okay. Well, that's our cue
to hit the road.

1097
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,347
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

1098
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,101
[Phoebe] So, is this party
at Mason's cabin, like, BYO-Indica?

1099
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,230
What's up?

1100
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,232
Nothing.

1101
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,485
Did my mom say something weird?

1102
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,237
I mean, I love her.

1103
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,366
She's my best friend,
but she's still a mom. [chuckles]

1104
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,534
No, she's fine.

1105
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,287
She was just sharing
all that dating stuff, I guess.

1106
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,039
Yeah. She always does that.

1107
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,958
I mean, talking too much.

1108
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,918
But... whatever.

1109
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,462
She's in a good place right now, so...

1110
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:19,923
With this guy?

1111
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,967
So he's...

1112
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,885
I mean, I guess she really likes him.

1113
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,929
I mean, at her age she's lucky

1114
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,556
to find someone
who isn't like a serial killer,

1115
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,642
married or both, so...

1116
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,435
I'm like, you go, girl!

1117
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,648
You sure she didn't say anything?

1118
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,149
No.

1119
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,360
I just wasn't expecting
to meet her right then.

1120
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,738
You are not good at acting
off the cuff, are you?

1121
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,240
[scoffs]

1122
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,789
- Oh!
- Like this.

1123
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,582
Last call, kids.

1124
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,586
Okay, so our firm
is one big popularity contest.

1125
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,299
We have the cool kids,
you have the nerds, the...

1126
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,842
the outcast.

1127
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,886
It's like high school all over again.

1128
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,722
I know exactly what you mean.

1129
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,140
This guy I was seeing

1130
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,310
got a slogan on a bottle of mustard,

1131
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,354
and thought it entitled him
to sleep with everyone.

1132
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,690
"Spicy goodness".

1133
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,610
Two words
and he thinks he is J.K. Rowling.

1134
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,654
Sorry. Nerdy reference?

1135
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,989
No. Are you a Potterhead?

1136
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,198
Guilty.

1137
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,784
Okay, I am stopping
this topic of conversation.

1138
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,286
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

1139
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:35,206
I got a sense of it and I'm drawing
my final conclusions and... [inhales]

1140
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,626
Your old boyfriend is an idiot.

1141
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,963
[Chad] He doesn't deserve you.
I mean... look at you. You're...

1142
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,049
Totally hot.

1143
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,760
- [small laugh]
- And smart.

1144
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,137
Uh, and stuff.

1145
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,223
Take me home.

1146
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,020
You don't want to hang out anymore?

1147
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,647
[laughs]

1148
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,442
- You are hysterical!
- [laughs]

1149
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,651
[door opening]

1150
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,528
[Claire] Here we are!

1151
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,240
So, I know it's a shoebox.

1152
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,576
[Claire] But I'm a promotion away

1153
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:14,037
from getting something bigger
near Wrigley.

1154
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,331
No, it's amazing.

1155
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,210
[Chad] Good, high ceilings... Central air.

1156
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,337
[Chad] Big windows.

1157
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,174
Hm... Decent view of the city.

1158
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,385
Pretty cool...

1159
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,936
Do you know what the first thing
I noticed about you was?

1160
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:42,899
Your tie.

1161
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,111
Yeah, well.
I'm still getting used to them.

1162
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,821
They always come out crooked...

normal assistant stuff.

Thank God Lilah is
at her grandparents' this weekend.

1176

She doesn't have to absorb any of this.

Hey, Erin.
You gotta get a load of these honkers.

- No, no. Mm-mm.
- I'm sorry, but you have to.

- No, no, no.

We're gonna borrow your car,

[laughing] Out of her mind.

1189
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,899
Are you still gonna have time to meet
with that college rep? I mean,

1190
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,775
it seems kind of a lot.

1191
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,652
Yeah, well, it turns out

1192
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,947
that the admissions guy from Clarke
is gonna be in town.

But I don't know
if I even want to meet with him.

Audrey, are you kidding?

1195
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,748
The only way to get off the waitlist
is to go for it. I mean,

1196
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,958
you should be calling every day.

1197
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,543
Getting rec letters...

1198
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,003
sending flowers to his wife...

four years in Dubuque?

Hurts my heart.

00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:34,761
I don't know.

1202
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,096
Hey, speaking of hearts,

1203
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,474
are we expecting a good season
for the Cubs?

1204
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,434
Let's just say,

1205
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,395
I am very glad
to be going to school here in the city.

1206
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,066
- Ooo!
- [Lilah's mom shouts] More Vicodin!

1207

[whispering] Oh my God! What's that?

1209
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,948
Oh, my God, I just peed a little.

1210
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,824
[chuckles] Wait.

1211
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,952
You're thinking about dumping her?

1212
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,037
We never have anything to talk about.

1213
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,581
And why are you trying to talk?

1214
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,085
[scoffs] The same reason I try
to talk to you and instantly regret it.

1215
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,507
If Paige Wilcox wants to date you,

1216
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,136
you date Paige Wilcox
until Paige Wilcox is done with you.

1217
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,555
Say Paige Wilcox again.

1218
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,598
I will if it makes her appear.

1219
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,353
So Milo and Lucy totally have
this twin thing going on.

1220
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,815
Like, Lucy got stung by a bee,
and I swear Milo could feel it.

1221
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,775
And they talk to each other.

1222
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,944
No joke. They have conversations.

1223
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,988
[Paige] Like in the kitchen the other day,
oh, my God.

1224
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,781
They were just chatting
and going on and on,

1225
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,199
it was the cutest thing ever.

I'm pretty sure
they were talking about cheese.

1227
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,454
So, how do you keep yourself busy
in the summer?

1228
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,957
I do driveway sealing.

1229
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,167
You know, like blacktop?

1230
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,503
It's just a summer gig,
but it's my own business.

1231
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,590
Ew, does that involve manual labor?

1232
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:54,966
Uh, yeah.

1233
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,135
Boring. Moving on. Hot tub, anyone?

1234
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,803
Hot tub, everyone.

1235
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,763
- [Mrs. Wilcox] Woo hoo!
- [man] Yeah, I'll take 'em.

1236
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,181
[roars]

1237
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,810
[sighs]

1238
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:52,523
[Erin] Okay, this is amazing!
We are on the field! [laughs]

1239
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,818
- Welcome to my office.
- Wow!

1240
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:57,820
[chuckles]

1241
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,614
Where are you taking me?

1242
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,159
Just wanna show you something.

1243
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,453
Okay. [giggles]

1244
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,621
Come on.

1245
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,250
[Erin] Oop! [laughs]

1246
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,836
A little scary, but I gotcha.

1247
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,046
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1248
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,047
Good job.

1249
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,178
This is the scoreboard?

1250
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,601
Okay, my dad is going to flip out

1251
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,103
when I tell him about this.

1252
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,938
Pretty cool, huh?

1253
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,732
You threw a picnic?

1254
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,401
Little bit, yeah.

1255
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,361
- Hope you're hungry.
- So cute.

1256
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,321
[gasps]

1257
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,740
[Santos] Oh, yeah.

1258
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,870
- Hi.
- Hey.

1259
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,956
That's where we met right there. Remember?

1260
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,207
[Erin] Ah! Yeah.

1261
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,459
Wow!

1262
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,669
Pretty cool, huh?

1263
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,505
Yeah. [chuckles]

1264
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,925
You've only been here three months
and you already own the place.

1265
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,595
Uh, yeah, at least until I hit
my rookie slump.

1266
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,849
Not on my watch, sir.

1267
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,811
Well, you know I am batting .344
since I ruined your dress,

1268
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,940
so I guess you are kind of
my good luck charm.

1269
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,191
See?

1270
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,321
[romantic guitar music plays]

1271
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,720
[uplifting music playing]

1272
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,161
- I come in peace.
- Hey.

1273
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,456
Sorry to ambush you. I...

1274
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,124
- I sent you texts, but I...
- I know.

1275
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,586
I'm sorry. Things have just been
kind of crazy lately.

1276
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:20,880
[Alec] Sure. Um...

1277
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,133
Listen, I've been thinking...

1278
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:25,802
and...

1279
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,513
the summer is just going by way too fast.

1280
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,558
And I wanted to see you
before we both leave for school.

1281
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,815
Should I take that as a no?

1282
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,858
Alec, we had an agreement.

1283
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,778
Then you went and posted pictures

1284
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,113
with your new girlfriend
15 minutes after we broke up.

1285
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,199
She posted that. I...

1286
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,203
You know what? You're right.

1287
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,330
I'm sorry. I hated that she did that,

1288
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,249
and I wanted you to know
it's nothing like that.

1289
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,875
What is it like with Party Paige?

1290
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,252
[car engine roars]

1291
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,419
[sighs] It's...

1292
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,089
[car engine revving]

1293
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:06,843
Hey!

1294
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,596
Wait, is that... That's...

1295
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,723
I gotta go. But, um...

1296
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,225
Have a nice 4th, okay?

1297
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,228
What is this?

1298
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,772
I got signed to Under Armour,
so no more squeaky brakes.

1299
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,108
- [Erin] Nice. Can I give this to you?
- [Santos] Absolutely. I'll take it.

1300
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,610
- [Erin] Very nice. I really like it.
- [Santos] Kinda cool, huh?

1301
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,445
[Santos] A lot more horsepower
than the last car.

1302
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,448
[car engine roars]

1303
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,325
Happy Independence Day.

1304
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,244
[screams]

1305
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,250
[cheering]

1306
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,721
One, two, three!

1307
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,645
Woo!

1308
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,649
- [girl] Yeah!
- [boy] Go get 'em, man!

1309
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:04,901
Yeah!

1310
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,490
- [yells]
- [Mason] Woo!

1311
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,035
Yes!

1312
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,454
Woo!

1313
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,832
[teens yell]

1314
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,051
[Mason] Here we go!

1315
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,844
[cheering]

1316
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:33,804
Mm-mm.

1317
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,766
- [girl 1] Hi!
- [girl 2] Oh, my God!

1318
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,809
- They are perfection! Can I feel?
- Sure.

1319
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,062
Oh, my God!

1320
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,189
That's my kind of ilk.

1321
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,274
The dude that I told you about.
He's hot for you.

1322
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:46,275
Right?

1323
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,113
[Claire] Just look around here.

1324
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,742
Three million people
all trying to get ahead of each other.

1325
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,036
Everyone fighting for the same spot.

1326
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,413
I guess I never really thought of it
like that.

1327
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,998
Yeah, that's because

1328
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,541
you cutthroat traders

1329
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,168
are too busy pillaging
your way to the top.

1330
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,836
[laughs]

1331
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,216
You're the first guy I've met here
who I don't feel has a secret agenda.

1332
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,385
Quick pit stop
before we head to the fireworks?

1333
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,844
For sure. [laughs]

1334
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,727
I'm sorry. Is this Chicago,
or is this Heaven?

1335
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,562
No, dude. We gotta tell 'em.

1336
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,358
Claire wants me to have lunch with her dad
who's a big honcho at Morgan Stanley.

1337
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,276
Wear the yellow tie. Says old school.

1338
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,611
Dude, I'm not kidding.

1339
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,072
Chad, remember...

1340
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,074
in a few weeks we're leaving for college.

1341
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,409
And the girls?

1342
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,121
They move on to some workforce douchebags
way worse than we are.

1343
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,626
[indistinct voices]

1344
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,712
[snores]

1345
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,013
[explosions and screams]

1346
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,681
[Griffin] O-kay.

1347
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,266
- Seriously?
- [boy] Woo!

1348
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,101
[laughs]

1349
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:03,978
You wanna...

1350
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:04,895
Yeah.

1351
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,272
[chuckles]

1352
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,151
I bet you had to fight off all the girls
with a stick this summer.

1353
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,736
[chuckles]

1354
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,156
Actually, you might be surprised.

1355
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,782
Really?

1356
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,789
I was thinking...

1357
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,125
why we don't go find our own spot

1358
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,085
and make our own fireworks?

1359
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,591
So you can tell me where I rank!

1360
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,218
Wait. What?

1361
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,888
Let me just publicly declare

1362
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,725
that I'm not the next fool
to fallfor this idiot's hook-up list.

1363
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,436
[chuckles]

1364
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,731
It's gone viral, douchebag!

1365
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,816
No one is gonna sleep with you.

1366
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,776
Ever.

1367
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,573
- Ew!
- Ah!

1368
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:59,325
- [girl] Jerk!
- Ah!

1369
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,495
[Lilah] Look at the stars.

1370
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:04,997
Just like you someday.

1371
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:06,665
I don't know.

1372
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,210
What? You're so talented.

1373
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,004
You'll at least have a lot of choices.

1374
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:13,547
Well.

1375
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,841
I mean, you will too, Audrey.

1376
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,760
Have you heard back from that college?

1377
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,136
Nah.

1378
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,180
Still just waiting around
for the low-hanging fruit.

1379
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,433
Wait.

1380
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,185
College has fruit?

1381
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,229
[chuckles]

1382
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,356
It's an expression.

1383
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:35,444
I've been settling for anything
that's left on the tree.

1384
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,363
My ex.

1385
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,157
My college. This job.

1386
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,242
Wait.

1387
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:44,662
Why would you ever
just settle for anything?

1388
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,374
And what do you mean, this job?

1389
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,875
[laughing] No offense.

1390
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,837
No, I mean, you're really good at it.

1391
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,256
And you're like my favorite person
that's ever worked for my mom.

1392
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,716
And there's been more than I can count.

1393
01:08:59,926 --> 01:09:01,261
I am?

1394
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,515
Yeah, [laughs] you are.

1395
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,020
Yeah, well, I mean, I am pretty awesome.

1396
01:09:11,104 --> 01:09:12,523
- [fireworks explosion]
- [Audrey sighs]

1397
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,066
Look, they're starting!

1398
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,152
[chuckles]

1399
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,821
They look so close! Whoa!

1400
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,332
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1401
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,960
[Phoebe] It's nice.

1402
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,381
I can't imagine what that party
is looking like now.

1403
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,049
Yup. [laughs]

1404
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,179
I'd much prefer doing something like this.

1405
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,433
I think I've always sort of been
an outsider on the inside.

1406
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:48,809
You know?

1407
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,314
Sometimes I feel like...

1408
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,318
I'm floating over my body,
like, watching my interactions.

1409
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,945
[laughs] An observer, for sure.

1410
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:01,697
I feel it too.

1411
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:05,034
Like, my dad's not in the picture, and...

1412
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,330
I think I handle it better
because I feel it less.

1413
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,540
Sometimes I...

1414
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,585
fear...

1415
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:16,712
whether I'm...

1416
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,798
even capable of love.

1417
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:25,638
Or if I'm just destined to observe it
for the rest of my life.

1418
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,057
You know what I mean?

1419
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,392
I wish I felt less sometimes.

1420
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,104
But I don't think
you need to worry about it.

1421
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,440
No, I just... I worry...

1422
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,902
if I've never been able

1423
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,987
to fully let my guard down with someone,

1424
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,240
maybe I'm not capable.

1425
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,826
Look, Phoebe.

1426
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,331
I'm gonna be real honest with you.

1427
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,168
I would like to be that person.

1428
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,547
And I love...

1429
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:04,760
that you are
a way-too-wise-for-your-years artist.

1430
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,888
And that you look like an angel,

1431
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:09,640
a sex goddess,

1432
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,726
and a nerdy librarian,
all at the same moment.

1433
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,063
Not that you look
like a librarian, or a nerd.

1434
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:17,731
I love nerds.

1435
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,109
- Not in a weird way.
- [chuckles]

1436
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,407
Phoebe.

1437
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,450
There's something I have to tell you.

1438
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,910
I'm listening.

1439
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,246
I can't tell you while you're kissing me.

1440
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,415
I'm not very good at taking direction.

1441
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,459
What do you wanna tell me?

1442
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:46,969
[sighs]

1443
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,017
I don't know.
I just... I have to tell you that...

1444
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,938
I'm so embarassingly in love with you.

1445
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,028
[whispering] I'm here.

1446
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:07,197
I'm right here.

1447
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,620
[crickets chirping]

1448
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:14,997
[Santos] Yeah, your cake was a hit, huh?

1449
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,665
[Erin] Yeah. Did people like it?

1450
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,751
[Santos] I think they did.
It looks like it's all gone.

1451
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,710
[Erin] Oh, good.

1452
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:21,962
[Santos] We're a really good cooking team.

1453
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,048
- [Erin] I think so.
- [Santos] Oh yeah.

1454
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:27,551
- [Erin] It's so beautiful here.
- Yeah.

1455
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,220
Yeah, this place is great.

1456
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,140
- Thanks for helping me find it.
- You're welcome.

1457
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,810
And this barbecue that you did
was first class.

1458
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:40,689
The last one that I hosted
had plastic chairs and a pig roast.

1459
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:41,982
I know what you mean. [laughs]

1460
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:45,027
I'm used to parties
where people are taking shots and...

1461
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:46,487
- throwing up everywhere.
- Ew.

1462
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,529
Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

1463
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,616
The guys on the team enjoyed
seeing you here tonight.

1464
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:51,700
Mm-mm.

1465
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,995
I told them to get used to it.

1466
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,511
- You're gonna lose. [laughs]
- Oh, my... [laughs] Oh, my God!

1467
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,304
Big fail.

1468
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:14,473
You are not gonna believe it!

1469
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,933
I submitted your reel,

1470
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,976
and you have a tryout

1471
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,395
with<i> America's Got Talent.</i>

1472
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,647
[Lilah's mom] But we have
a lot of work to do before then,

1473
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,649
so I want to start
full rehearsals this Friday.

1474
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,025
This Friday?

1475
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,821
But... Audrey and I were going
to the beach. We had a whole plan.

1476
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,656
You can go to the beach any day.

1477
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,990
This is the big time.

1478
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,159
[Lilah's mom] This could be national TV.

1479
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,495
[Lilah's mom] So Sebastian's coming over
to work on your inflection.

1480
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,248
I think<i> Baby Love</i> will knock 'em dead.

1481
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,209
You want me to sing?
You know I hate singing.

1482
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,628
Lilah, you have a beautiful voice.

1483
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,338
So, unless you have some hidden talent,

1484
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,048
like juggling blindfolded,

1485
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,842
you are going to sing.

1486
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,677
[footsteps moving away]

1487
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,471
[car engine roars]

1488
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,349
[man on the radio] <i>...and there's a smash</i>
<i>from Ricky down the line.</i>

1489
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,393
<i>This kid is unbelievably hot.</i>

1490
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,270
[sighs] This sucks.

1491
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,730
I'm rooting against my own team
because of that guy.

1492
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,108
He, y bro, which is worse?
My hookup list flameout

1493
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,360
or you ending things with Paige willingly?

1494
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,530
I'm sorry, bro.
She has the IQ of a toaster.

1495
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:12,865
I can't do it.

1496
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,366
This was gonna be the summer.

1497
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:17,077
- I'd been planning it for months.
- No. Don't sweat it, bro.

1498
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:19,496
Honestly, the hookup gods
are just punishing you

1499
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,206
because you were getting too greedy.

1500
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,667
- I don't know, man...
- No, seriously, bro.

1501
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,210
From the fat kid in 8th grade

1502
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,713
to the jacked badass sitting
next to me right now,

1503
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,965
you had a pretty sick run
with the ladies in high school.

1504
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,760
Yes. You did. You did it. [laughs]

1505
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:40,225
Right?

1506
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:43,896
Wait...

1507
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,773
Wait, wait... [chuckles] what?

1508
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:48,525
- You're...
- [sighs]

1509
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,737
No! [laughs]

1510
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,489
What?

1511
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,948
- How can this even be possible?
- [laughs]

1512
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,325
[stammers] I don't know man, I just...

1513
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,660
You know, I was so busy with ball,

1514
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,621
you know, I was traveling every weekend

1515
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,623
and had camps every summer,
I just never really...

1516
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,792
But I just figured, you know...

1517
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,921
This was the summer
I'd make up for lost time.

1518
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,173
[laughs]

1519
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,301
I don't know, man, I...

1520
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,970
I guess that list was pretty lame.

1521
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,431
Kinda got what I deserved.

1522
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,432
[scoffs]

1523
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:21,850
Forget it, man.

1524
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,352
All right? Just clean the slate.

1525
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,437
[birds chirping]

May-sawn!

1529

Griff!

1530
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,454
Dude, how's my mix coming?

[Griffin] <i>Sounding sick.</i>

1532
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,706
Dude, I'm working on it right now.

1533
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,084
We're sitting at 100 beats per minute,
you're gonna love it.

01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,336
[Griffin] <i>It's not your usual</i>
<i>chillin' out bongapalooza.</i>

1535
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,712
Perfect, bro.

1536
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,215
I'm stoked. Special occasion.

1537
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,008
[Griffin] <i>Special occasion?</i>

1538
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,469
Oh, hell, yeah. [laughs]

[knocking on door]

1541
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,017
- Hey, honey!
- [Griffin] Hey, Mom.

1542
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,436
Oh, you have a friend downstairs.

1543
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:08,772
Cute.

1544
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,824
Hey.

1545
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,535
Guess what?

1546
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:24,955
You okay?

1547
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,331
No, my mom found out

1548
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,709
that the piece of shit
she's been dating is married.

1549
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,545
Can you believe that?

1550
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:33,880
Oh.

1551
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,550
I'm so sorry.

1552
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,051
Is this an epidemic?

1553
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,512
Like, can anyone be faithful anymore?

1554
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,098
You know, my mom feels like
she's been sucker-punched,

1555
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,601
and it makes me feel
like you can't trust anyone.

1556
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,437
He just seemed like the most normal guy.

1557
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,064
- Have you met him?
- Yeah, once. Why?

1558
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,441
No. I'm...

1559
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,484
just processing this.

1560
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,778
It makes me want to tell his family.

1561
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,448
Did you... talk to her?

1562
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:00,866
No, no. I haven't.

1563
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,117
Well, you have to.

1564
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,786
Look. We have to talk.

1565
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,079
Come on.

1566
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,666
- Bye, Mom.
- [Griffin's mom] Wait.

1567
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,210
You're taking off?

1568
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,546
Yeah. We're just gonna go for a walk.

1569
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,465
It was really nice to finally meet you.

1570
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:20,093
[Phoebe] You raised a great son.
One of the last good ones, maybe.

1571
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,054
He always speaks very highly of you.

1572
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,388
[sighs] Thank you.

1745
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:05,011
[under breath] complicated.

1746
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:06,054
Hm. Right.

1747
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:06,971
[sighs]

1748
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,557
Then you should figure it out, then.
Take all the time you need.

1749
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,561
[doorbell ringing]

1750
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:15,647
[sighs]

1751
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,028
- [man] Phoebe Fisher?
- Yeah.

1752
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,281
[man] It's prepaid.
Enjoy.

1753
01:27:26,115 --> 01:27:28,117
[romantic music playing]

1754
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,158
[knocking on door]

1755
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,159
[Griffin's mom] Griffin?

1756
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,413
I, uh... I picked up
a new laundry bag for your dorm.

1757
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,916
- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- You know, you'd think that...

1758
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,129
with you having been away at Berkshire...

1759
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:25,800
that all this goodbye stuff
would be easier.

1760
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,637
[clumsy voice] But it isn't.

1761
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:33,433
Mom.

1762
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:40,982
There is something I need to tell you.

1763
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:45,236
[romantic ballad playing]

1764
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:50,700
So, I know it's short notice, but, uh...

1765
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:55,538
my family is renting this place
in Michigan for Labor Day weekend...

1766
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:57,498
- Claire...
- ...it's really gorgeous.

1767
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,666
- [Claire] There's no TV.
- Claire...

1768
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,877
- [Claire] So at night we sing songs...
- Claire!

1769
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,546
I'm 18.

1770
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:05,882
What?

1771
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:07,592
I just graduated high school.

1772
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:09,260
I'm not a trader.

1773
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,387
[Chad] I don't even know
what CBOE stands for.

1774
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:13,431
I do now, because I googled it, but...

1775
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,770
Was wondering how long is was gonna take
for you to tell me that.

1776
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,357
What? You knew?

1777
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,316
[laughs]

1778
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:27,236
Oh, please.
You are way too sweet to be a trader.

1779
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:31,699
And that first morning,
your wallet was open on the floor.

1780
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:33,659
[Claire] I saw your license.

1781
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:36,496
Along with your robotics club
membership card.

1782
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:38,831
I had no idea you were treasurer.

1783
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:41,250
Should really lead with that more.

1784
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:45,463
What about all that stuff
about meeting your dad?

1785
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,882
[chuckles] I liked watching you squirm.

1786
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,259
And Janet?

1787
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,262
She's not pissed
we're just a couple of lying dorks?

1788
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,765
- Does she look pissed?
- [Reece] One more. One more.

1789
01:29:58,017 --> 01:30:00,019
Whoever said that you weren't cool

1790
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:02,188
doesn't really know you.

1791
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,023
I do.

1792
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:07,276
And this is who you are.

1793
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:11,322
Can we, like, get married today?

1794
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:13,950
[laughs]

1795
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:22,834
[boat horn]

1796
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:26,087
[Mr. Edmunds] To be honest, Ms. Jarvis,
your transcript is very...

1797
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,296
average.

1798
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:31,426
Yeah. Well, my GPA suffered the past
two years because I've been working.

1799
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:32,593
Pretty much all the time.

1800
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,345
Oh! In what capacities?

1801
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,431
Fast-food joint, coffee shop.

1802
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,808
You take what you can get, you know?

1803
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:41,519
Well, obviously,
we can't offer admission to everyone.

1804
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:44,605
And believe me, you would be lucky
to have our institution in your life.

1805
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,774
Nonetheless, we do see some potential...

1806
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:49,402
and that is why we are willing
to take a risk

1807
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,904
and offer you admission to Clarke College.

1808
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:53,197
You mean I'm in?

1809
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,574
On a probationary basis.

1810
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:56,033
- What's that mean?
- You may enroll,

1811
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,119
but you will not be
eligible for campus housing,

1812
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:00,246
the Greek system or student government.

1813
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,041
So basically I am shut out
of all the fun parts of college.

1814
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:05,668
Congratulations.

1815
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,588
Mr. Edmunds...

1816
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:11,549
I pass.

1817
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:12,508
[Mr. Edmunds] What?

1818
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,304
You guys were my last choice and...

1819
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:18,222
I don't wanna settle.

1820
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:19,474
[Mr. Edmunds] You're passing on us?

1821
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:21,767
So, you're left with nothing?

1822
01:31:22,935 --> 01:31:23,811
No.

1823
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:27,106
I'm left with me.

1824
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,611
Look, I may not know what I'm gonna do,

1825
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:34,655
instead of attending my backup school,

1826
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,782
on a probationary basis.

1827
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,868
But whatever it is...

1828
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,954
[chuckles] I'm gonna kick
the shit out of it.

1829
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,250
Thank you, Mr. Edmunds.

1830
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,382
Twenty-three driveways
and two parking lots. Record summer.

1831
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,468
No doubt. I'm beat.

1832
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,720
Hey, you think you can handle
this invoice for me?

1833
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,931
There's something I need to do.

1834
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:03,643
That sounds extremely vague, but...

1835
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:04,560
[laughs]

1836
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:06,270
Sure. Go ahead, I'll finish up.

1837
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:09,899
- Good work this summer.
- You too.

1838
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:16,614
[sighs]

1839
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:19,283
[knocking on door]

1840
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:26,290
So we're all finished. Mrs. Davis.

1841
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,502
Oh, not Mrs. anymore. Nicole's fine.

1842
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:31,837
Looking really good.

1843
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:33,923
I've been watching you guys all week.

1844
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:35,550
Yeah.

1845
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:36,968
Um...

1846
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,719
So, I've got your invoice.

1847
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,596
Let me go get my checkbook.

1848
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:42,765
Come on in. I'll get you something cold.

1849
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,645
[Nicole] Unless you're in the mood
for something

1850
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:49,146
hot.

1851
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,491
[cheering]

1852
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,952
[announcer over PA] <i>And here comes</i>
<i>local product, Mason Riley,</i>

1853
01:33:03,035 --> 01:33:05,663
<i>who has a shot at the podium
here in his final run.</i>

1854
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,093
Woo!

1855
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:22,888
[cheering]

1856
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,243
[announcer pver PA] <i>He sticks it!</i>
<i>He sticks it!</i>

1857
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,788
<i>You've just punched your ticket
to the fall season tour.</i>

1858
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:50,041
[crowd cheering] Mason! Mason!

1859
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:00,968
- [inhales heavly]
- Mmm. Are you okay?

1860
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,387
Two breakups in one summer,

1861
01:34:03,512 --> 01:34:05,598
maybe if I hurry up
I can cram in a third. [laughs]

1862
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,434
Okay, but you don't have time
for those childish games anymore.

1863
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:11,145
- I mean, you're a college woman now.
- [laughs]

1864
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:12,521
How was your interview?

1865
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,274
So... big news.

1866
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:16,525
- [clears thoat]
- Yes?

1867
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,028
I'm not going to college.

1868
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,365
But I am enrolled

1869
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:24,492
in Teachers Without Borders.

1870
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:26,827
Well, that's amazing,

1871
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,789
but you're gonna go
to college eventually, right?

1872
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,040
Okay.

1873
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,168
- I love you.
- [Erin] Mm-hmm.

1874
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:36,796
But we come from different places.

1875
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,298
You just have to understand

1876
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:42,343
that you've got different opportunities
because of that.

1877
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:45,388
I'm sorry. Are you upset because
I got into my first choice?

1878
01:34:45,554 --> 01:34:47,807
Because I worked really hard.

1879
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:50,101
I know you did. And I would never
take that away from you.

1880
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,729
Look, Erin. You're gonna be successful.

1881
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:54,647
[scoffs]

1882
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:58,693
I just... I need you to not judge
my version of success.

1883
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:00,695
Which is...

1884
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:03,447
- not settling for Dubuque.
- [laughs]

1885
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,534
It's teaching
little twerps English in Borneo.

1886
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:07,743
- Aw.
- [laughs]

1887
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,120
And it turns out...

1888
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:11,539
I like kids.

1889
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,166
Mmm. I'm proud of you.

1890
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:17,586
Are you mad at me?
Are we gonna fight?

1891
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,297
Uh, no. I love you, like, too much.

1892
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:22,591
-[Erin inhales heavly] Mmm.

1893
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,177
- [Erin] Hmm...
- [Audrey] What?

1894
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,555
[gasps] He came!

1895
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:29,140
- [Erin] Hm.
- [Audrey] Oh, wow.

1896
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,891
[Audrey] Okay, you gotta go.
This is dramatic enough.

1897
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,977
- Are you sure?
- Go! Get the hell out of here.

1898
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:35,563
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you. Good luck.

1899
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:36,522
[under breath] Thanks.

1900
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:45,489
Hey.

1901
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,075
Your parents sent me an invite.

1902
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,368
I wasn't sure if I should come.

1903
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:50,911
I'm glad you did.

1904
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,538
[chuckles]

1905
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,249
So where's the rookie of the year?

1906
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,418
Ah. Struck out.

1907
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:58,919
- [Erin laughs]
- [Alec scoffs]

1908
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,546
What about Paige?

1909
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:01,672
Turned the page.

1910
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,799
There was a better book
out there somewhere.

1911
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,885
Ah, what was she, a scratch and sniff?

1912
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,636
[laughs]

1913
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,222
I miss smart people.

1914
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:13,225
I missed you.

1915
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:15,770
I was thinking...

1916
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,313
Um...

1917
