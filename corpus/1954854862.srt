00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,433
What?

182
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,701
That was awesome.

183
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,002
Come on, up top.

184
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,538
You put that
filthy thing away...

185
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,541
And give me
the good stuff!

186
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,644
( all cheering )

187
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,447

( engine revving )

188
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,816
( all screaming )

189
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,818
Who looks stupid now?

190
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,822
Who's not so great now?
( laughs )

191
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,691
( brakes screech )

192
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,426
( engine sputtering )

193
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,462
Hey!

194
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,798
Gotta be crazy
to try and stop hater!

195
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,867
Right, wander?

196
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,401
( roars )

197
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,872
( engine revving )

198
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,444
Please, sir! Just let them go!

199
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,712
The planet is ours!

200
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,846
Shut up, peepers!

201
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,015
Forget the planet,
I want that trophy!

202
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,484
I'm the greatest in the galaxy!

203
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,455
( roars )

204
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,991
Yahoo!

205
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,759
( brakes screech )

206
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,927
Hey, hater!

207
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,662
Final challenge for the win!

208
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,031
Last one into town
is a rotten egg!

209
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,866
Please, sir! No!

210
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,468
¶ all right!

211
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,736
( beeping )

212
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:08,172
( engine revving )

213
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,774
¶ all right!

214
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,144
Lord hater,
number one superstar! Whoo!

215
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,548
I'm...

216
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,816
The greatest...

217
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,984
In all...

218
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,153
The galaxy!

219
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,738
( all cheering )

220
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,743
Wow, what a...

221
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,811
Neat...

222
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,046
Little...

223
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,547
Town!

224
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,135
Hi. Sorry to bother.

225
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,072
Just wanted to stop by
and give you this.

226
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:21,245
Congrats. You won that race
fair and square.

227
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,752
Well, best be goin'.

228
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,153
Later, hater!

229
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,731
( roars )

230
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,566
( roars )

231
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,134
( grunts )

232
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,737
That all you got,
you overgrown iguana?!

233
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,873
( roars )

234
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,047
Take that! ( laughs )

235
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,915
( roars )

236
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,183
( groaning )

237
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,285
Uh, syl...

238
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,754
You think...

239
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,022
That maybe...

240
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,556
You should...

241
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,558
Try another...

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,760
No!

243
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,163
I-I-I-I-I-I've got this!

244
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,531
( groans )

245
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,235
Totally under control.

246
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,904
( groans )

247
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,241
Yeah, but maybe there's
another way to stop--

248
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,243
No, this is the only way!

249
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,780
I'll be fine!
I need to bash this beast!

250
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:29,781
Okay.

251
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:29,781
Let's see...

252
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:29,781
Something to help,
something to help,

253
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,251
Something to help,
something to help,

254
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,852
Something to help,
something to help--

255
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,656
( gasps )

256
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,327
( roars )

257
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,965
Oh, you poor baby!

258
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,335
( groaning )

259
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,171
( screams )

260
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,772
( groans )

261
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,775
Oh, don't you worry!
We'll get you back to mama!

262
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,811
Even if she wants to kill us!

263
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,780
Yes, she does!
She wants to kill us dead!

264
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,016
Great job, wander.

265
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,718
This rock is perfect
for bashing that beast!

266
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,154
Sylvia, sylvia, sylvia...

267
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,856
It's like I always say,

268
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,860
A little lump of love will take
the buck out of the bronco.

269
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,328
( brakes screech )

270
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,329
Huh?

271
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,331
This rock is an egg,

272
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,367
And that beast
is this egg's mother.

273
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:28,239
And once it's put
back in its nest, it will hatch.

274
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,845
And mother and child
will have a joyful reunion!

275
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,680
¶ mother and child, y'all

276
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:40,852
And the power of love will
turn her into a nurturing mommy,

277
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:45,223
Instead of flying harbinger
of death and destruction!

278
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,757
Forget it!

279
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,759
Sappy, smooshy-wooshy,
lovey-dovey silliness

280
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:48,759
Ain't my style.

281
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,996
You're on your own
this time, wander.

282
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,865
That thing wants to eat us!

283
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:57,869
And the only way to get her
to back off is to fight her off!

284
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,070
( grunts )
ow!

285
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,038
I'll have
nothing to do with this!

286
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,841
Well, poo-poo to you,
miss punchy punchersons.

287
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,111
Who needs ya, anyway?
I'll do it myself!

288
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,114
With the power of love!

289
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,850
( grunting )

290
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,219
( groans )

291
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,420
Stupid egg.

292
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,691
What am I, a babysitter?

293
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,759
"let's go get the egg."

294
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,995
( roars )

295
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,001
Stop!

296
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,869
( brakes screech )

297
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,239
( grunting )

298
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,842
<i>Slow down.</i>

299
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,811
There's a baby on board!

300
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:49,820
( whistling )

301
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,724
( roars )

302
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,200
( roars )

303
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,801
Ugh!

304
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,973
Perfect! If we hurry,
we'll escape before it
realizes there's an exit!

305
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,243
Slower!

306
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,751
<i>Slower.</i>

307
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,796
Sl--
wander!

308
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,298
Look, we have got
a very short window of time

309
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,801
Before dragon breath
figures out a way to get to us.

310
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,804
If we're gonna get to that nest
in the next millennium,

311
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,806
This baby
is gonna have to man up--

312
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,307
( cheering )

313
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,742
And why are you doing that?!

314
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:51,382
Aw! She likes you!

315
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:53,818
( roars )

316
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,019
( screams )

317
00:15:58,423 --> 00:15:59,523
My baby!

318
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,460
( screams )

319
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,029
Phew!

320
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,499
( screams )

321
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,769
Phew!

322
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,274
( screams )

323
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,442
Phew!

324
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,912
( screams )

325
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,187
Phew! Safe and sound!

326
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,323
Right back where we started!

327
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:38,929
( roars )

328
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,865
Quick! Out here,
we're fish in a barrel!

329
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,800
What is wrong with you?!

330
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,369
You've been flingin'
this poor thing around
like a sack of potatoes!

331
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,806
Do you know nothing
about proper parenting?!

332
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,274
( roars )

333
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,176
What?! What?!
What do you want me to do?!

334
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,844
The baby needs to know
we're helping it,

335
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,046
Not hurting it.

336
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,881
It needs some reassurance.

337
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,382
It needs...

338
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,550
Don't tell me.

339
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,353
A hug!

340
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,521
Over...

341
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,588
My...

342
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,856
Dead...

343
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,857
Body!

344
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,693
( roars )

345
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,265
There! Good, right?!
Good?! Can we go?!

346
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,600
( roars )

347
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm not happy right now.

348
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:26,510
¶

349
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:31,048
¶ we are on a quest
to get egg-y to the nest-y ¶

350
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,984
¶ projectile spines
hit more than they miss ¶

351
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,986
¶ well, the baby
has a scratch ¶

352
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,988
¶ on her shell
that hasn't hatched ¶

353
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,925
¶ and a boo-boo
just demands a kiss ¶

354
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,928
¶ and now you're shiverin'

355
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,596
¶ from frosty freezy
ice breath ¶

356
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,200
¶ and I can tell you want
to punch me in the gut ¶

357
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,634
¶ baby's cold,
have to admit ¶

358
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,570
¶ needs mother hen
to sit on it ¶

359
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,939
¶ and you have got
the biggest butt ¶

360
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,642
¶ after getting hit
with monster spit ¶

361
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,611
¶ a bath we take

362
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,081
¶ and now we soothe eggy-poo
with patty cake ¶

363
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,118
¶ caring for children
is such fun, won't you agree? ¶

364
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,619
¶ you thought
you'd kick some monster butt ¶

365
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,554
¶ instead you dressed for tea

366
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,057
¶

367
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,227
¶ as we approach
our final destination ¶

368
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,563
¶ you have been burned
and singed and smashed ¶

369
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,532
¶ it was all worth it,
oh, you'll agree ¶

370
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,401
¶ 'cause finally
you will see ¶

371
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,403
¶ a lump of love
will take the bronco's buck ¶

372
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:25,403
¶ oh, yeah

373
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:29,440
¶ a lump of love
will take the bronco's...

374
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,608
¶ buck

375
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,677
¶

376
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,114
( groans )

377
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:48,959
( groans )

378
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,100
( panting )

379
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,602
( grunts )

380
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,673
Finally.

381
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,475
Good riddance!

382
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,646
( gasps )

383
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,593
( knocking )

384
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,627
Oh!

385
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,695
Oh!

386
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,572
Oh, I see what you're doing.

387
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,974
Well, it's not gonna work.

388
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,177
No cutesy-wootsey egg
is gonna make a softy out of me!

389
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,181
Just as soon as wander
sees his lovey-dovey plan
go up in smoke,

390
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,717
I will be back to doing
what I do best--

391
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,286
Kicking some monster butt!

392
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,654
( grunting )

393
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,495
Huh?

394
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:57,495
Here we go!

395
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:02,466
Hey, aren't you gonna
stay for the reunion?

396
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,135
Why? Do I look like
a giant flying lizard?

397
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,637
Climbing a mountain like...

398
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,173
( grumbling )

399
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,407
I can't believe
I'm doing this!

400
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:16,080
¶ oh, yeah

401
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,649
¶ mother and child, y'all

402
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:22,152
¶ mm-hmm,
it's the big reunion ¶

403
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,588
¶ ow! Look out!
That's the wrong baby! ¶

404
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,725
( roars )

405
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:32,129
Aah! Sylvia!

406
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,797
( roars )

407
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,199
You were right!

408
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,567
( roars )

409
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,402
It does wanna eat us!

410
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,104
( roars )

411
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,572
Sylvia!

412
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,741
( roars )

413
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,609
Back off,
you thick-witted skink!

414
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,512
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?!

415
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,681
( roars )

416
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:54,218
Hush now, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be...

417
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,686
( roars, gasps )

418
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,556
All right?

419
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,458
( growls )

420
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:07,431
( roars )

421
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,634
( whimpering )

422
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,406
( coos )

423
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,574
( gulps )

424
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,708
( sighs )

425
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,444
Look! A little lump of love!

426
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,613
( cooing )

427
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,149
Took the buck
out of the bronco.

428
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,651
( laughs )

429
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,421
Aw!

430
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,825
¶

431
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,226
¶ oh, wander

432
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,663
¶ over yonder

433
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,799
¶ and check out this and that

434
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,234
¶ if you wander

435
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,638
¶ over yonder

436
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,808
¶ best be sure
to wear your hat ¶

437
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,277
¶ all the things
that you will see ¶

438
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,745
¶ and you certainly
will be free ¶

439
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,680
¶ if you wander over yonder

440
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,716
¶ just you and me

441
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,883
¶
