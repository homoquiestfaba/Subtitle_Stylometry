There's no story.

No, I value our people's lives.

00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,664
I'll take Jane to the Dark World, and
draw the enemy away from Asgard.

696

When Malekith pulls
the Aether from Jane,

697
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,706

The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.

our heads right now,

his men will fall on
10,000 Asgardian blades.

706
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,482
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

As many as are needed!

Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

719
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:13,041
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,973
What was his last name again?

728
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,311
And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.

729
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,525
He was later taken
into police custody

730
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,445

734

No one is to come

735
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,548
or to go.

736
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,349
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

737
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:11,228
What use is a guardian such as that?

738
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,432
Malekith will return,
you know this.

739
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,023
I need your help.

740
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:23,240
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

742
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,536

strong and unchallenged

743
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,243
whether he is or not.

744
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,123
But he is blinded, Heimdall

745
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,951
by hatred and by grief.

746
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,707
As are we all.

747
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,003
I see clearly enough.

here on is a risk.

00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,766

He can sense its power.

755

If we do nothing,
he will come for it again

756
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,739
but this time, lay waste
to all of Asgard.

Jane off-world.

locked away in the vault.

To mock?

767
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,566
Loki, enough.

768
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,826
No more illusions.

Now you see me, brother.

770
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,512
Did she suffer?

771
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,973
I did not come here
to share our grief.

772
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,185
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

773

Go on.

774
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,645

as much as I do.

775
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,694
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

Vengeance

777
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,943
and afterward, this cell.

779
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:39,497
You must be truly desperate

780
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,754
What makes you think
you can trust me?

781
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,251
I don't.

782
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,049
Mother did.

783
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,838
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

784
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,139
I did so with a glimmer of hope

785
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,092
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

786
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,187
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

787
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,392
You betray me, and I will kill you.

788
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,404

790

He will betray you.

791
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,736
He will try.

792
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,701
This is so unlike you, brother.

793
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,869
So clandestine.

794
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,235
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

795
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,874
If you keep speaking,
I just might.

796
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,842
Fine. As you wish.

797
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,382
I'm not even here.

798
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,214
Is this better?

799
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,884
It's better company at least.

800
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,933
Still, we could be
less conspicuous.

801
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,858
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

802
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,401
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

803
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,737
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

804
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,947

to like them so much.

805

another who will not take it.

1345
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,862
Is this my legacy?

1346
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,622
Loki died with honor.

1347
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:38,950
I shall try to live the same.

1348
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,455
Is that not legacy enough?

1349
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:53,806
It belongs to you.

1350
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:56,301
If you are worthy of it.

1351
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,887
I shall try to be.

1352
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:05,026
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1353
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,650
I know.

1354
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,826
If I were proud of the man
my son had become,

1355
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,662
even that, I could not say.

1356
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:22,786
It would speak only from my heart.

1357
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,583
Go.

1358
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,166
My son.

1359
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:31,545
Thank you, Father.

1360
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:48,190
No.

1361
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,193
Thank you.

1363
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,624
I present to you,

1364
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:15,833
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1365
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:18,506
Whoa...

1366
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:26,140
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1367
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:31,941
You know why we're here.

1368
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,567
Of course.

1369
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:40,650
But, if I may ask,

1370
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:44,696
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1371
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,744
The Tesseract is
already on Asgard.

1372
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:51,415
It is not wise to keep two
Infinity Stones so close together.

1373
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:54,539
That's very wise.

1374
01:45:04,381 --> 01:45:05,758
I can assure you,

1375
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:12,231
it will be absolutely safe here,

1376
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:16,936
in my collection.

1377
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:20,526
See that it is.

1378
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,586
One down.

1379
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,590
Five to go.
