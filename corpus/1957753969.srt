-I'll give the both of you.

192
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,788
five seconds
to give me my money.

193
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,055
-You pull that trigger

194
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,191
and hell's fire
will rain on you.

195
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,660
-Wouldn't be my worst day.

196
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,764
One.

197
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:42,770
-Hear us out, Mr. Wilder.

198
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,071
-Two.

199
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,709
Three.

200
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,178
-You like gold, Dutch?

201
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,479
-Four.

202
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,783
-We know where enough of it is
to make you a rich man.

203
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,221

-Next time I see you,

208
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:27,314
I'll take your balls out
and eat 'em.

209
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:31,251
-You have no idea
what hell awaits you, boy.

210
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:37,090
-[laughs] Yeah, right.

211
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,694
[Sally] A few months ago,
I heard rumors

212
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:43,463
that the wolves out East were
planning to hire prospectors

213
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:44,799
to mine deep for gold

214
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,535
within Indian Territory.

215
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,938
One simply cannot believe
in rumors alone,

216
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,140
so I did a little
sniffing around

217
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,545
and with luck, I stumbled
across this telegram.

218
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:01,049
Along with it, we intercepted
their Indian scout

219
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,382
who was hired to escort them

220
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,886
through an area called
the Black Woods.

221
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:08,121
an uncharted forest somewhere
beyond the prairie wasteland,

222
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,258
and this is what
they found so far.

223
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:14,629
-Those flakes.
they ain't worth shit.

224
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,633
-If you make sure
those prospectors

225
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,334
don't make it back East,

226
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,037
I'll let you take out
as much gold as you can carry.

227
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,472
-I ain't no damn miner.

228
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,240
[Wallace] By now,
those prospectors

229
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,109
have probably found
enough deposits

230
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,445
leading them to a vein.

231
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:34,949
We can sweep on in
and take it from them.

232
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,418
If not, I'm there to find it.

233
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,188
-Sound rosy?

234
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,057
-All right, let me
get this straight.

235
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,094
You want me to kill
a couple of miners for you.

236
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:49,964
And then you want me
to go dig for my own payment

237
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,232
in a place that no one knows
how to get to.

238
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,103
-Not only did we retrieve
that pouch of gold

239
00:18:55,202 --> 00:19:00,742
but we, uh,
convinced their scout.

240
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:02,242
to give us directions.

241
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,444
-You know
how to kill people.

242
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,582
And I know how to find
shiny things.

243
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:08,716
-Is that a fact?

244
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:13,021
-That much gold
can set a man for life.

245
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,623
Help him disappear.

246
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:19,226
You don't want to be fetching
envelopes forever, do you?

247
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,263
-Hi, handsome.

248
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,901
-Ain't you just
a rose in the desert.

249
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,570
-Oryen, go see
where Edward ran off to.

250
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:31,906
-Oh.

251
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,173
-Man.

00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,078
-Buy a girl a drink?

253
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,513
-What's your name?

254
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,648
-Wendy.

255
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,315
-I'll meet you upstairs.

256
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,618
[Wendy blows a kiss]

257
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,657
-Two Feathers,
you got seconds.

258
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:54,696
-You'll find what
you're looking for,

259
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:57,431
and once you do,
we'll all be rich and free.

260
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,801
One more thing:

261
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,271
There are many legends
about the Black Wood.

262
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,576
So, as you travel forth
from here, please take caution.

263
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:11,679
Let's hope those stories
I've heard are not all true.

264
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,214
We must be going.

265
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,188
-Miss Pickerton,
if you cross me,

266
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,090
I'll find you and tie a rope
around your neck.

267
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,625
I'll drag you behind my horse
till there ain't nothing left.

268
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,631
You see, I don't care
that you're a woman.

269
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,735
-Keep in mind,

270
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:37,105
if Mr. Price doesn't return
to me within a month,

271
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,107
I'll have every lawman
hunting you down

272
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:40,808
ready to hang you and your men.

273
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,812
You are right, Mr. Wilder.

274
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,013
I am a woman.

275
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,350

want to fuck with.

276
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,389
Happy hunting.

277
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,793
Get yourself
a bottle of whiskey.

278
00:20:58,893 --> 00:20:59,961

00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,638
