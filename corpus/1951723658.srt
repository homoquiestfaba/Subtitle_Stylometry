1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,027
<i>All kids are afraid of the Boogeyman.</i>

2
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>Henry and I were no different,</i>

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,742
<i>even before that night.</i>

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,888
- It's the one I wanted.
- You sure?

5
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,719
We can always return it, get something
you want more, like schooI clothes.

6
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,350
I told them you wanted a dirt bike,
but they wouldn't listen.

7
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,453
- Help me put it together, Henry, please.
- Sure, after I use the bathroom.

8
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,999
- Who wants cake and ice cream?
- I do.

9
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,668
- Great job, sweetie.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,639
Didn't you go to the bathroom, paI?

11
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,469
Yeah.

12
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,811
I thought we talked about this.

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,115
You're 11 years old now, bud.

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,591
The hallway light burned out again.
Will you fix it?

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,801
See? Nothing to worry about.

16
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,079
Dad.

17
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,327
Henry, I saw him.

18
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,529
I saw the Boogeyman.

19
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,965
He is reaI.

20
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,202
No, no.

21
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,553
No.

22
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,132
When the police came, he was gone.

23
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,170
But only for the time being.

24
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,398
Are you still afraid of the Boogeyman?

25
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,235
No, of course not.

26
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,544
I just meant...

27
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,778
What happened to my parents
is still vivid to me.

28
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,082
I'm really sorry, Laura.
No one should have to go through that.

29
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,387
- Henry said that the intruder wasn't caught.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,518
- Do you and Henry ever talk about it?
- No, no.

31
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,160
We talk around it.
It's what people do, you know.

32
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,061
It's not easy admitting you're afraid
of the Boogeyman,

33
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,009
even to your own sister.

34
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,541
You know, the three months
that Henry's been here,

35
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,841
we've been able to help him.

36
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,849
- If you're open to this program...
- No, it's not...

37
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,284
It's okay, I'm 18 now. I'm fine.

38
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,949
Hey.

39
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,228
I hope I'm not interrupting.

40
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,235
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,843
- I'm here if you need to talk, okay?
- Okay.

42
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,412
- Either one of you.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,945
I can't even tell you how much I miss this.

44
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:07,219
Seriously, I have not had
Marsha Marsha Marshmallow

45
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,521
since you left for the clinic.

46
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,028
I meant you.

47
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,598
- You know, us hanging out.
- Yeah.

48
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,066
I knew what you meant.
I just missed Marsha more.

49
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:23,437
So tonight, your favorite TV shows
Tivo'd and ready to go,

50
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,101
your lasagna,

51
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,769
and I thought maybe we'd stop by the mall
and get you some shirts

52
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,246
that don't have paint
and sweat stains on them.

53
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,445
- I have a job interview tomorrow.
- Already?

54
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,023
- Where? When did you do that?
- It's a printing company in San Francisco.

55
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,651
- Yeah, I applied online at the clinic.
- Wow.

56
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,630
That's great, Henry.

57
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,065
Well, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's perfect. They do lithography.

58
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,498
It's like silk-screen,
but for, you know, posters and stuff.

59
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,801
I mean, the guy saw my work
and he loves it, you know.

60
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,470
He said I could use some of his equipment
for my own stuff if I wanted.

61
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,344
San Francisco's just so far away.

62
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,249
I mean, you would have to live on your own.
You're sure you could do that?

63
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,548
Well, yeah. Yeah, you know.

64
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,419
I mean, I can do it now.

65
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:16,221
The Hillridge Clinic, it, you know,
really made me a different person.

66
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,960
It would've been nice if you included me
in your decision.

67
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,865
I'm including you now.

68
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,263
No, now you're telling me.

69
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,034
You know, we should go.

70
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,940
I shouldn't have even had this ice cream.
It's freezing.

71
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,979
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
It's just an interview.

72
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,674
We can talk about it when I get back.

73
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,580
Just forget it, okay?

74
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,486
Want some help?

75
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,038
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

76
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,740
What, now you're not gonna talk to me?

77
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,520
Henry?

78
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,095
Henry!

79
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,284
It's okay, it's okay. I'm here.

80
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,698
When did you do this?

81
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,702
While you were gone,

82
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,273
it got really bad.

83
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,880
Every time I closed my eyes,
I could see him.

84
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,914
He's been waiting.

85
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,856
- Waiting?
- For us to be apart.

86
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,828
I always told you
that I could handle it, but...

87
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,630
That you were the one that needed help.

88
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,971
But the truth is,

89
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,543
I don't want you to go, Henry.

90
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,110
I can't do this on my own.

91
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,237
You can call me whenever you want.
You know that, right?

92
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,035
Yeah, I have my cell phone.

93
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,042
That won't do you any good out here.

94
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,274
You're just gonna have to settle
for what us old-timers call a landline.

95
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,912
Cut off from the rest of the world,

96
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,182
no cell phone, lockdown every night.

97
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,884
I'm really starting to reconsider.

98
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,357
Laura, the lockdown
is just an insurance precaution

99
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,951
for the hospitaI proper.

100
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,500
It helps the administration sleep better
at night knowing that the building is secure.

101
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,795
You mean making sure
that crazy people aren't roaming the halls.

102
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,131
Got you.

103
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,969
<i>The night staff is here if you need them,
and you will have phone access 24l7.</i>

104
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,944
What do you say?
You want to see your room?

105
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,974
Sure.

106
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,584
Look, I'II...

107
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,216
I'll check in as soon as my interview
is done tomorrow, okay?

108
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,258
You promise?

109
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,928
On my life.

110
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,137
You know, the people here,
they're just like you and me.

111
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,705
They're not as crazy as you think.

112
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,777
Stay away from me, you crazy bitch!
I'm just trying to urinate.

113
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,209
- Well, Nicky, this is...
- Complete bullshit!

114
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,406
You have to talk to Dr. Allen
and make him call off his henchmen.

115
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,608
I'm sorry, Dr. Ryan.
We just finished her weekly weigh-in

116
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,185
and I found her sneaking in the bathroom.

117
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,379
Okay, let's talk about this later.

118
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,855
Nicky, I want you to stop by my office
in a few minutes.

119
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,121
- But I didn't do anything.
- I know, but I want you to see me anyway.

120
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,990
This is Laura Porter. She's Henry's sister.

121
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,693
- She's going to join our...
- Whatever.

122
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,634
There's really a nice girI hiding inside
of Nicky.

123
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,764
Yeah, well, maybe one of them
should try eating a sandwich.

124
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,942
- I didn't realize bulimia was a fear.
- It's not.

125
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,886
She suffers from a fear of gaining weight.

126
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,519
So this is Henry's old room.

127
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,257
He painted this while he was here.

128
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,034
- Do you want me to take it down?
- No, leave it up.

129
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,040
He always said
when things were too dark growing up,

130
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,011
that you were the one to pull him out.

131
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,413
Funny.
I could say the same thing about him.

132
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,682
Laura, I'm very happy that you're here.

133
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,892
I'm gonna let you unpack.

134
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,495
Then you can meet the other patients
and Dr. Allen.

135
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,721
Dr. Allen?

136
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,061
He's head of the hospitaI
psychiatric department.

137
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,032
I'll see you in group.

138
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,342
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

139
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,640
Your door was open,
so I just wanted to come in and say hi.

140
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,943
- Hi, I'm Mark.
- Laura.

141
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,746
And this charming guy behind me,
that's PauI.

142
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,184
- Hi.
- Hi.

143
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,585
- Germaphobe. Don't take it personally.
- Oh.

144
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,095
My light in my closet went out.
Would you mind taking a look?

145
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,097
I got it.

146
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,702
Thanks, bud.

147
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,938
So it looks like we have something
in common, huh?

148
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,568
It's the dark. He's terrified of it.

149
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,782
For me, it's not so much the dark,
it's what lives in the dark.

150
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,981
- You must be Henry's sister.
- Pretty stupid, huh?

151
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,920
Everyone's afraid of something.

152
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:23,540
Hillridge Clinic, Santa Barbara County,
January 22nd.

153
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:29,019
Dr. Jessica Ryan's
severe phobia group therapy session.

154
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,216
Dr. Mitchell Allen,
hospitaI administrator, supervising.

155
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,604
I'm afraid of losing controI of my life,
so I cut.

156
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,732
Cut? You mean...

157
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,942
Most people try to deaI
with their emotions internally,

158
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,979
but Alison finds that overwhelming.

159
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,446
It's really more like impossible.

160
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,987
But with one cut,
all the internaI stuff becomes externaI.

161
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,249
I can just deaI with it, you know.

162
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,154
But then if I stop...

163
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,456
I'm afraid to stop.

164
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,765
- How about you? What's your deaI?
- Same thing as my brother.

165
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,636
I saw my parents killed when I was a kid.

166
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,774
The police never found the guy.

167
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,642
Well, you can't catch the Boogeyman, right?

168
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,681
- He hasn't had a problem finding me.
- He?

169
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,618
You continue to see this "he"?

170
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,359
I don't always see him.

171
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,322
- Sometimes you just...
- You feeI him.

172
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,363
I felt him. Here, in this place.

173
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,801
- Alison, that's not constructive in any way.
- What?

174
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,806
We're all here because we have shit
to deaI with from our past, right?

175
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,274
Just because somebody comes
and gives it a name and a face

176
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,400
doesn't mean it's not reaI.

177
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,948
Laura's fear is less ethereaI.
She fears a specific entity.

178
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,610
The clinicaI term is Bogyphobia.

179
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,882
- Bogyphobia? Are you fucking kidding me?
- Nicky.

180
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,618
And here I thought you were suffering
from some serious ailment,

181
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,489
like Easter Bunny phobia.

182
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,063
- You scared of Santa Claus, too?
- Okay.

183
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,759
All right. Are you guys finished here?
Laura? Laura.

184
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,903
- Laura!
- I'm kind of scared of Santa Claus.

185
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,001
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

186
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,681
That's it?
You're just gonna throw in the toweI?

187
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,684
Nicky's right. I'm wasting everybody's time.

188
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,912
Shit!

189
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,395
You know, I've lived with this for 10 years
and managed, you know?

190
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,497
But when you're really alone,
there may come a time

191
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,761
when you can't manage.
Because I know I didn't.

192
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,692
Look, Laura,

193
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:04,739
my mother spent her entire life
in an institution battling schizophrenia.

194
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,209
And every month,
my dad would take me there to visit her.

195
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,973
It was different then.

196
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,380
It was electroshock therapy
and sensory deprivation.

197
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,081
It turned her into a vegetable.

198
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,154
She would just stare at the wall
and she'd mumble.

199
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,259
It's probably the worst sound in the world.

200
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,998
And then I found out that it was hereditary,

201
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,534
and I was so scared
I was going to become her one day.

202
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,235
UntiI I faced my fear.

203
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,940
- How?
- By studying it.

204
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,707
I became a psychiatrist
because I wanted to understand the illness.

205
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:51,154
Laura, you just have to expose the fear
and really look at it, and you will get better.

206
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,155
But it's your choice.

207
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,403
Good night, Gloria.

208
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,709
Buzz me out.

209
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,010
See you tomorrow.

210
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,754
- Yo, Mark.
- Yeah?

211
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,160
- The package arrived.
- It did?

212
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,292
- You know, the one you've been waiting for.
- Halftime, all right?

213
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,864
- Thank you very much.
- CooI.

214
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,838
Hey, not on the floor.
I turned the basement lights on.

215
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,203
Yeah. Sure, no problem, man. Thanks.

216
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,433
Hey, ladies.

217
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,467
Fuck, fuck! Ow! Fuck!

218
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,837
Perry?

219
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,078
Hey, I'm still down here!

220
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,197
Hey. Hey!

221
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:25,326
Hey, I'm still down here!
Hey, I'm still down here!

222
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,672
Hey, I'm down here! Wait!

223
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,873
Jesus Christ! Help me!

224
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,814
I'm down here! Please! Help!

225
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,264
Anybody there?

226
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,267
Hello?

227
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,306
How did he... I mean, you just don't fall
into an elevator shaft.

228
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,811
You do if it's dark
and you're baked out of your mind

229
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,508
on Perry's hydroponic pick of the day.

230
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:24,186
Sorry, I don't mean to state the obvious,

231
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,914
but wasn't Mark afraid of the dark?

232
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,655
The police think
that Mark's fear instigated his fall.

233
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:35,163
He turned off the lights
to avoid being caught.

234
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,701
And once it was dark, he panicked.

235
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,133
Wait.

236
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,337
But I heard Gloria tell the police
that he was

237
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,508
cut in half.

238
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,277
I mean,
that doesn't sound like an accident to me.

239
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,115
Apparently, he tried to climb out
of the elevator shaft,

240
00:25:56,221 --> 00:26:00,885
but he only got halfway into the basement
before the car came down on him.

241
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,520
Every time I think about it,

242
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,756
- and all the blood that...
- Whose chair is this?

243
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,231
Doctor, this isn't my chair.
This isn't my chair!

244
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,498
- Who stole my chair?
- PauI...

245
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,735
- Who stole it?
- PauI. Right over here. Is that it, there?

246
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,312
You've got to breathe.
You need to breathe.

247
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,907
Okay, wait.
Here, here, let me feeI. Come on.

248
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,349
Here's your hand soap.
Get in your seat.

249
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,216
Here, I've got it right here.

250
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,086
Here, let me help you.
Let me get that off there.

251
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,025
Mark was the only one
who actually believed I could get better.

252
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,187
He made me believe it, too.

253
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,458
We'll take as much time as is needed

254
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,797
- for you to absorb Mark's accident.
- No, don't.

255
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,599
It doesn't sound like an accident to me.

256
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,043
I think somebody else turned the lights off.

257
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,338
Like who, Laura?

258
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,822
- Maybe it was the Boogeyman?
- Nicky.

259
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,396
Maybe it was.

260
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,202
- This is counterproductive.
- Counterproductive?

261
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,702
Laura has as much right as anyone
to share her fear with the group.

262
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,144
I'm sorry.

263
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,147
Let's reconvene later today, okay?

264
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,978
Hey, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Who's dead?

265
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:41,751
Mark fell into an elevator shaft.
I think maybe somebody killed him.

266
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,797
- Henry?
- Yeah, I'm here.

267
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,034
Look, I've been driving all night
and I just got to my interview.

268
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:55,300
I'll head straight back there
the second I'm done.

269
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,432
You don't believe me?

270
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,533
I didn't say that. I just...

271
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,873
<i>Look, I've been there.
Whenever something bad happened,</i>

272
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,279
<i>I thought he was coming back to finish
what he started when we were kids.</i>

273
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,784
Yeah, but now you're ready to leave
the past behind and throw me away with it.

274
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,354
- No, Laura...
- Yeah, I've got to go.

275
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,947
Look, if I drive through the night,
I'll make it there by 5:00 a. m.

276
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,391
- Just sit tight, okay?
- Hurry.

277
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:49,490
I had maintenance fix that for you.
I'm sorry if you were upset this afternoon.

278
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,822
- I didn't intend...
- I'm fine.

279
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,891
I'm leaving tomorrow morning, anyways.

280
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,602
What you fear doesn't live inside
that closet, Laura.

281
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,103
It lives inside you.

282
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,675
Can you remove it surgically
or do I need an exorcism?

283
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,873
You know, we've always struggled

284
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,741
to understand the darkness within us.

285
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,516
Fears and anxieties buried so deeply

286
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,787
that they're just too painfuI to face.

287
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,885
And you think my darkness
is the Boogeyman.

288
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,032
But how does that describe
what I've seen with my own eyes,

289
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,262
what other kids have seen
throughout history?

290
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,634
Well, it's a common scapegoat.

291
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,275
Our society will always find a way
to externalize.

292
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,505
Every culture around the world
has a name for him.

293
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,981
The words sound different,
but they all describe the same being.

294
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,210
How does your theory account for that?

295
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,913
We're all afraid of the same thing.

296
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:55,789
The Boogeyman, germaphobia,
they're all masks.

297
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,887
Masks that we create to hide

298
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,431
what we're truly afraid of.

299
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,196
What do you think I'm truly afraid of?

300
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,768
Well,

301
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:15,879
if you're willing to stay,
willing to accept

302
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,610
that your fear comes from within,
maybe we'll find out.

303
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,254
Hello, Jessica.

304
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,532
I didn't know you were still here.

305
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,696
I'm thinking about staying overnight,
actually.

306
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,005
We're short-staffed
now that Perry's been fired,

307
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,546
and I'm really concerned how everyone's
been affected by Mark's death.

308
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,214
Jessica,

309
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:59,823
the board's gonna have a lot of questions
about what happened here today.

310
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,223
Mark's accident has nothing to do
with my program.

311
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,795
Your program?

312
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,323
Your experiment.

313
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,333
The board has always thought

314
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:16,099
that putting this particular group
of patients together was a mistake.

315
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,370
And, quite frankly,
I'm beginning to agree with them.

316
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,740
I'm really sorry to hear that.

317
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,936
- I'm sorry.
- Get the fuck out now!

318
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,379
Christ! Watch where you're going.

319
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,089
Do me a favor.
Walk with me and follow me to my room.

320
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,262
- No, thanks, I'll pass.
- Come on, I'll owe you one.

321
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,119
Common sense dictates I shouldn't ask,
but what's the bucket for?

322
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,025
We all have our own way of dealing
with Mark's death.

323
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,122
Isn't that why you went off on Henry earlier?

324
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,467
No, but thanks for listening in.

325
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,208
Henry always said you were the reason
he wanted to get better

326
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,778
because he didn't want to hold you back.

327
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,940
- He told you that?
- Every day he was here.

328
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,590
I never meant to hurt him. It's just...

329
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,622
You and Darren?

330
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,932
Once upon a time.

331
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,698
What? And he's in here

332
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,636
because he's afraid of being
anything but an asshole?

333
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:14,108
Agoraphobic.
Completely terrified of the outside world.

334
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,210
You'd never know by looking at him,
though, right?

335
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,780
He's cute. I see why you fell for him.

336
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,790
Yeah, well, don't think that just
because he pays you a little attention,

337
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,984
he's actually interested in you.

338
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,924
- Nicky, I was just saying...
- Will you just leave?

339
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,622
- Nicky.
- I want to be alone.

340
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,564
- Just leave me alone, okay? Get out!
- I'm not even interested.

341
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,644
PauI?

342
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,556
- PauI, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

343
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:08,224
- We missed you at dinner.
- Yeah, well, you see this mess.

344
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,838
Well, if you wanna talk,
I'll be in my room, okay?

345
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,630
Hey, PauI?

346
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,561
PauI?

347
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,373
- Oh, God!
- Get help now!

348
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,399
Come on, buddy.

349
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,417
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

350
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,616
Oh, Jesus Christ!

351
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,153
Get help!

352
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,088
- I think he's dead.
- What happened?

353
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,788
Call down to the hospitaI.
I want some paramedics up here.

354
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,382
He must've swallowed it.

355
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,515
Like... What? You mean, like, on purpose?

356
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,491
You think he killed...

357
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,233
The phones are dead. I can't get a diaI tone.

358
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,107
I can't get a pulse.

359
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,882
Jesus Christ!

360
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,244
Go down to the hospitaI.

361
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,911
- I want you to find somebody.
- No, it's not happening.

362
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,580
We can't buzz open the doors
with no phones.

363
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,350
Well, doesn't somebody have a key?

364
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,620
- Dr. Allen has an overriding key.
- There has to be an emergency exit.

365
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,821
Do you know how much older this place is
than the actuaI hospitaI?

366
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,661
I'm sorry, so you're telling me
that we're stuck here untiI the morning,

367
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,166
untiI Dr. Allen comes?

368
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,671
- No! No, there's no way! We have to get out!
- Alison! Alison!

369
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,798
I'm sure that the phones
are only out temporarily, okay?

370
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,400
Hey, Henry will be here at 5:00 at the latest.

371
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,412
He will get someone
to open those doors, okay?

372
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,607
Laura, take everybody down to the rec room.

373
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:30,153
Okay. Okay, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

374
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,113
I need you to help me cover him up.

375
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:46,434
Okay, let's just...
Let's just leave him right here, okay?

376
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,868
Go ahead. You check on the kids.

377
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,944
Jesus, PauI, what the hell happened to you?

378
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,026
It's still out.

379
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,572
Somebody is bound
to pass by sooner or later.

380
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,239
Why don't you go down to the basement
and check the computer system?

381
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,476
It integrates the phone lines
with the security system.

382
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,519
Maybe it just went offline.

383
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:42,523
- I'd really appreciate your help.
- Okay.

384
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,555
If I see someone, I'll flag them down.

385
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,932
How're you holding up?

386
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,231
What was it that PauI drank?

387
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:04,212
It was this mixture that he made
out of industriaI-strength cleaners

388
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:07,341
'cause he couldn't find one
that was strong enough.

389
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,748
Why would PauI have a cockroach problem?

390
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,579
Oh, he wouldn't.

391
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,681
He kept all his food
in one of those airtight things.

392
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,662
No, no, I know, but there was a cockroach.
It crawled under his bed.

393
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,425
I mean, there's food all over his floor.

394
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,559
Well, that's not like him.

395
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,968
No, food attracts bugs,
and bugs have germs.

396
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,636
And he would've been terrified
at the thought of it.

397
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,078
Just like Mark would've been terrified
of a dark basement.

398
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,173
Wait. You actually think she makes sense?

399
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,946
Well, nothing that's happened in the past
24 hours really makes sense, Nicky.

400
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,420
Jesus Christ, what does it matter?

401
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,718
PauI killed himself, someone killed PauI.

402
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,192
Either way, it's just one less person
whining in group tomorrow.

403
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,128
You know, you might want to watch
how hard you sell that!

404
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,564
And what the fuck were you doing
in his room, anyway, Darren?

405
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,331
It was him.
I saw him in the hallway earlier, okay?

406
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,141
- He preys on our fears.
- That's it, I'm out of here.

407
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,944
It's what he does. He knows what scares us.

408
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,024
Gloria?

409
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:30,827
Gloria!

410
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,503
Hey, any luck with the phones?

411
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,236
Gloria's in the basement.
She's reconnecting the system.

412
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,872
- Have you seen Darren or Nicky?
- A few minutes ago. Why?

413
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,309
- It's not important. Get some rest.
- Okay.

414
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,255
Gloria?

415
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,071
Gloria?

416
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:36,824
God.

417
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,662
Oh, my God.

418
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,105
Who is that?

419
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,244
God, no, please.

420
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,544
Please. No!

421
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,398
Someone there?

422
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,866
It's just me.

423
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:49,200
- What the fuck are you doing in here?
- I don't know where else to go.

424
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,466
What are you talking about?

425
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,510
Mark and PauI are dead.

426
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,506
Yeah. I was there, remember?

427
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,912
I know you, Darren.

428
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,422
Come on, it must have been terrible
finding PauI like that.

429
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,025
But you can't keep shutting me out.

430
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,994
You're the only person here that I trust.

431
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,196
Why did you end up hating me so much?

432
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,330
- Huh? What did I do?
- You didn't do anything, Nicky.

433
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,242
Then it's the way that I look?

434
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,411
Did I... Did I get too thin?

435
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,352
- I'm the one with the problem, not you.
- Bullshit!

436
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,425
Nicky, what I'm dealing with,

437
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,753
it's not just being afraid
of the outside world. You know, it's...

438
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,832
It's the people out there, too.

439
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,678
So you don't think I'm disgusting?

440
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,185
I'm agoraphobic, I'm not blind.

441
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,673
Alison?

442
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,347
Hey, are you awake?

443
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,331
Oh, my God!

444
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,572
Alison, Alison. Oh, my God!

445
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,743
Help! Nicky!

446
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,213
Somebody! Help!

447
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,414
Nicky!

448
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,584
Somebody, help!

449
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,588
Nicky!

450
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,330
Let me in!

451
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,300
Come on! Is somebody out there? Please!

452
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,805
- What was that?
- I don't know.

453
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,015
Anybody!

454
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,914
Laura! What's wrong?

455
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,010
Somebody killed Alison.
Come on, we have to find Dr. Ryan.

456
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,486
What are you talking about?

457
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,421
- What's going on?
- Alison's dead. Somebody cut her open.

458
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,087
- Where's Dr. Ryan?
- I don't know. Everybody's gone.

459
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,061
Come on, I'll show you!

460
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:17,898
Right here.

461
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,170
There was blood everywhere.

462
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,139
- He must've cleaned it up.
- Who cleaned it up?

463
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,845
- It was...
- Who, Laura?

464
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,788
Alison was Iying in this bed.
Her arms were cut to shreds.

465
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,757
She was probably in the middle
of one of her cutting sessions,

466
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,827
and you interrupted her.

467
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,158
There were maggots crawling out
from underneath her skin.

468
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,494
It was like she was trying to cut them out.

469
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,227
You know what? Just stop. Where's Alison?

470
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,734
- I just told you.
- No! No, where's Alison, really?

471
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,081
Hello!

472
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,888
I already checked up here.
Everyone is missing.

473
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,731
She's right. I don't see anybody.

474
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,230
Gloria went down to the basement
a couple of hours ago

475
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,331
to fix the phone system.
Maybe she's still down there.

476
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,808
It doesn't take a couple of hours
to restart a computer.

477
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,539
Hey, guys, Dr. Allen didn't sign out.

478
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:43,547
Hey, what Laura said about people
being forced to face their fears,

479
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:44,642
who did that sound like?

480
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,915
You don't think
that Dr. Allen could be behind this, do you?

481
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,583
He's been fucking sadistic lately.
Look at the way he treated Laura.

482
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,184
No. He was just afraid
we'd all start buying into her theory.

483
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,853
Maybe he was afraid I was right.

484
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,195
Okay, what about the time he locked Henry
in the closet?

485
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,267
What?

486
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,393
He refused to let him out
untiI he faced his fears.

487
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,471
Come on, you know him
and all of his "darkness within" bullshit!

488
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,403
Look. Okay, I'm the first one
to bash on Dr. Allen,

489
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,338
but he wouldn't do something like this.

490
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,934
What else did he make Henry do?

491
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,912
Help! Somebody get us the fuck out of here!

492
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,198
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

493
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,695
<i>"Patient suffers
from delusions and hallucinations</i>

494
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,664

Oh, my God.

00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,530
Shit!

502
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,413
Who's there?

503
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,383
Nicky?

504
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,661
She's out here, Darren.

505
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,232
- What's that?
- I found it in Dr. Allen's office.

506
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,164
- Any keys?
- No.

507
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,896
But you're right
about Dr. Allen being sadistic.

508
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,632
Before he came to the Hillridge Clinic,
he treated others like me.

509
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,710
- One was this guy, Tim Jensen.
- So?

510
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,904
One night, Jensen killed a bunch of people,
claimed the Boogeyman did it.

511
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,981
What?
Like a split personality or something?

512
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,312
That's what Dr. Allen thought.

513
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,154
Jensen ended up killing himself
under Dr. Allen's care.

514
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:37,022
I mean, he almost lost his license over it.
He's just as afraid as the rest of us.

515
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,028
He's terrified that he's been wrong
about the Boogeyman all along.

516
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,859
And then you show up.

517
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,059
Allen's bad memories resurface
and people start dying, right?

518
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,499
Fuck this!

519
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,970
Darren, wait!

520
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,743
Darren! Darren, stop it!

521
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,873
Both of you just get the fuck
away from me!

522
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:09,819
Darren!

523
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,823
Darren, calm down!

524
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,830
- Leave me alone!
- Darren! Listen!

525
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,026
We need to fix the computers
in the basement so we can get out of here.

526
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,625
You think someone wants to kill us?

527
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,432
It could be Dr. Allen
or it could be either one of you.

528
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,973
I'm gonna lock myself in my room
untiI the morning staff gets here, okay?

529
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,202
- Problem solved.
- I want to stay with you. Okay?

530
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,809
You guys, please.
I can't go down there by myself.

531
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,014
What are you doing?

532
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:46,178
The second somebody shows up,
I am out of here.

533
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,454
You can't just leave.

534
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,990
Watch me.

535
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,632
- Where are we gonna go?
- "We," Nicky?

536
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,760
I've got news for you, there's no "we".

537
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,469
I thought things were gonna be different
this time.

538
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:09,944
Darren, look, I know what happened
between us scares you, okay?

539
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,479
No, no, no! You don't know.

540
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,049
See that's the problem is
you think you know.

541
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:17,380
You think you know me. You think
you have me all figured out, right?

542
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:21,253
You have no idea
what kind of person I really am.

543
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:25,051
You know, Nicky,
you're always so worried about fixing me.

544
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,391
Why don't you try fixing yourself first, huh?

545
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:28,725
- Take a good look at yourself.
- Don't!

546
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,356
- Try fixing yourself!
- Don't, Darren!

547
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,495
You know what?
Just get the fuck out of here.

548
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:35,764
- Just get the fuck out.
- What?

549
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,874
Just get the fuck out of my room!

550
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,910
- And stop being so fucking pathetic!
- You're hurting me!

551
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,478
DeaI with it!

552
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,183
You're Iying to yourself, Darren.

553
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,612
You'll end up dead on the inside.

554
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,413
One day, your heart's
just gonna shriveI up and rot away

555
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,983
before you ever have the chance
to share it with someone.

556
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,641
Fuck!

557
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,951
<i>I didn't want to hurt Nicky.
I was just so fucking scared.</i>

558
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,659
<i>She said that she loved me and...</i>

559
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,767
<i>And I just... I felt like I couldn't breathe.</i>

560
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,538
<i>Well, this is how we do it, Darren.</i>

561
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:40,480
<i>We conquer our fears
by facing them head-on.</i>

562
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,627
No fucking way.

563
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:53,759
<i>Your reaction, I think,
tells us something about your illness.</i>

564
01:02:56,806 --> 01:03:00,765
<i>I suspect what you're truly afraid of
is opening up.</i>

565
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:17,856
<i>Fearful that if you do,
she'll rip your heart right out.</i>

566
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,342
Darren!

567
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,745
No!

568
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:48,929
Help!

569
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,976
Dr. Ryan? It's him.

570
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,279
He is reaI.

571
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,454
Oh, my God.

572
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,482
What did he do?

573
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,564
He is reaI.

574
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,466
- He is reaI.
- Just like your mother.

575
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,204
He is reaI.

576
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,273
He's reaI.

577
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,807
You have to be quiet.
You have to be quiet. Please.

578
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,713
You have to be quiet. He's gonna find us.

579
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:47,059
He is reaI.

580
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,692
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

581
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,131
I'm sorry.

582
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,271
I'm sorry.

583
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,747
Dr. Allen, how did you...

584
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,239
What are you doing?

585
01:15:56,351 --> 01:16:01,880
Laura, everything's gonna be fine.
The police are on their way.

586
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,787
Now you and me are gonna go upstairs

587
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,292
- and have a nice little talk, Laura.
- No, no, no, no.

588
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:07,895
The Boogeyman, he's here, okay?

589
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,124
- We have to go.
- No, Laura. No, he's not, Laura.

590
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:15,726
You should of seen what he did
to Nicky and Darren and PauI, too.

591
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,304
I found them.

592
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,342
- What is that?
- It's just a sedative, Laura, that's all.

593
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,709
It's a sedative, all right? Now, come on.

594
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,339
Wait. Wait, do you think that I did it?

595
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:32,352
Now, Laura, please, don't make this difficult.

596
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,617
Stop! Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

597
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:39,387
If you'd have listened to Tim Jensen,
he'd still be alive.

598
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:40,893
To Tim Jensen?

599
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:48,325
He's right behind you!
He's right behind you. Look! Look!

600
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,870
- He's not behind me!
- Yes, he is!

601
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,999
- He doesn't exist!
- Yes, he does! Look!

602
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,464
In time you'll see that I'm right.

603
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,825
No! No! No!

604
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,359
- It's okay, Laura. I'm here.
- No!

605
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,730
No, it's not you!

606
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:56,693
Henry!

607
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,904
Don't hurt me, please.

608
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:05,309
- Laura, I would never hurt you.
- You hurt the rest of them.

609
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,607
No.

610
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,683
- Not me.
- Henry!

611
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,387
Stop it!

612
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:21,920
Leave her alone!

613
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,804
Try to remember, Henry.

614
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:38,975
Try to remember what actually happened
the night that your parents were killed.

615
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,946
He was waiting for me.

616
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:46,943
He was hiding from my family in the closet.

617
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,489
The Boogeyman wasn't there, Henry.

618
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:56,728
He wasn't there when you were 11,
and he isn't there now.

619
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,197
See?

620
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:17,245
- No, no, no. I can't do it. I can't do it.
- You don't have a choice.

621
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,376
Stop! Hey!

622
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,183
No! What're you doing?

623
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,723
- You stay right there. Right there.
- Please, help me!

624
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:27,824
This is how you do it.

625
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:32,332
If you want to conquer your fears,
you have to face them.

626
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,298
Face them head-on.

627
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,333
Face the darkness on your own.

628
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,998
Look him right in the eye.

629
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,409
He's not reaI, Henry.

630
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,944
- He's only in your head.
- Oh, no. Help me. No!

631
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,284
He has power over you because you allow it.

632
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:01,452
He's in here! Help me! Oh, God.

633
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,360
Help me!

634
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,661
Help me!

635
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,662
Help me!

636
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:20,107
<i>He's hiding. I saw the Boogeyman.</i>

637
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:23,082
<i>He's... He is real.</i>

638
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,383
He's not reaI, Henry.

639
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,724
He's only in your head.

640
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:46,332
The night mom and dad died,
I should've done something.

641
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,705
What could you do? You were 11.

642
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,211
- I can help you.
- Help me?

643
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,283
- Yeah.
- Like you always have?

644
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:03,089
I'm your older brother.
I should've been taking care of you.

645
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,525
I was always so scared.

646
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,859
But the Boogeyman,

647
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,095
I looked into his eyes,

648
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:24,103
and saw that he's afraid of nothing.

649
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:28,672
You killed them. Mark, PauI!

650
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:31,977
Alison.

651
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:35,079
- He forced them to face their fear.
- Henry.

652
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,216
You thought the Boogeyman
was your greatest fear. You're wrong.

653
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,989
- He'll show you your true fear.
- Henry!

654
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,732
Stop it, Henry! Stop!

655
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:52,798
Stop!

656
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,204
Henry!

657
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,345
Now, you listen to me.

658
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:05,215
I hurt you much more than I helped you.

659
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,250
I'm sorry for that.

660
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,790
You suffered a psychotic break.

661
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,459
But you did help me.

662
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,531
I'm completely cured.

663
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:10,706
Dr. Allen, let go. No, no!

664
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:30,144
Dr. Allen's records indicate that
your brother was released severaI days ago

665
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:32,481
in positive mentaI health.

666
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,212
Did you find her?

667
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:38,918
You're the one currently being treated
for Boogeyman-related delusions.

668
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,652
Is that correct?

669
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:46,423
- Dr. Ryan? Did you find her?
- I told you. We searched twice.

670
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:50,894
Except for you, we didn't find any survivors.

671
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,640
Detective, there's something in here
I think you need to see.

672
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:04,851
Good morning.

673
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:13,919
Well,

674
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,661
I think we found the last body.

675
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,305
No.

676
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:06,511
I think you're gonna have to come with us.

677
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:12,744
- No.
- Okay, we're gonna need some help in here.

678
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:14,845
Henry, he's still in here, okay?

679
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:17,924
You have to listen to me, okay?

680
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:19,651
Henry's still in here!

681
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:23,288
Henry's still in here!
You have to find him. He's still in here.

682
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:28,233
Henry's still in here!
Listen to me! Listen to me!

683
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,167
Henry's still in here!
