I never thought that this son of a bitch
wanted to be a millionaire.

00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:15,870
You should have thought about that many years
back and work for it.

00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:27,085
Anyway, what would

76
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:49,787
Mom is right, it's time to think
in a retirement home is not fair to her.

77
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:53,723
Do not need a retirement home
only need something that gives meaning to your life.

78
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,363
That's all that happens.

79
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,398
Yes, it's pathetic.

80
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:02,329
Seems that drinking is the only thing that has given meaning to
your life, until now.

81
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:06,133
Mom and I are seeing reality,
and you should too.

82
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:07,866
A retirement home is best for him.

Which, let's face is much more
what he thought of us.

84
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:13,605
Never gave anything for you or for me.

85
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:21,887

552
00:49:29,363 --> 00:49:30,796
That's what makes you feed pigs.

Do you have any other cars?

554
00:49:44,378 --> 00:49:47,142

Do you have imported cars?

567
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:17,368

Nice to meet you.

Your dad is the celebrity here.

579
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:57,299
That's what I came to talk to
my dad did not win anything, not the lottery or anything.

580
00:51:57,511 --> 00:51:59,945
He is a little confused by something
received in an email.

581
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:01,739
And he has gotten out of hand.

582
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:03,677
Or is that not
won a million dollars?

583
00:52:03,884 --> 00:52:05,044
No ma'am.

.

585
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:11,519
He was always very confused.

586
00:52:11,725 --> 00:52:13,852
ŻUsted  met my dad?

587
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,756

588
00:52:15,962 --> 00:52:20,422
I do not want to talk but other
Woody and I used to be together.

589
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:22,295
ŻUsted was his love?

590
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:23,526
That is correct.

591
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:24,863
What happened?

592
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:27,006
Your mom, that's what happened.

593
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:28,504
As this Kate.

00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:34,005
I can say Pig greets Benders.

596
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:35,238
Okay.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

597
00:52:35,348 --> 00:52:36,576

598
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:39,375
Why would she won.

599
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:44,080
It's water under the bridge,
not get me wrong.

600
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:46,020
I married a fantastic man.

601
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:49,525
We made this newspaper together.

602
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,254
Until he died,
had 3 children.

603
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:53,558
Eight great-grandchildren.

604
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:55,166
I have no complaints.

605
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:59,934
ŻWoody drink then?

606
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,803
Sure,
happens early here.

607
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:06,270
Not much to do really.

608
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:11,111
Now there are many things.

609
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:13,582
For Woody, everything went wrong from Korea ..

610
00:53:13,787 --> 00:53:15,880
Had hard times there

611
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:18,216
I thought I was just a mechanic.

612
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:20,359
If it was for armed aircraft.

613
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,222
But he was shot when he was transferred.

614
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:25,660
You knew that, right?

615
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:57,094
Thank you.

616
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:19,208
Here, Woody, and Albert Ray

617
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,487
They look like kids.

618
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:30,687
Your dad did not talk much and when
returned, hardly said a word.

619
00:54:31,097 --> 00:54:33,395
But I was always very friendly.

620
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,500
People took advantage of him.

621
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:38,068
And he could not return the favor.

622
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:43,504
Now everyone thinks he's a millionaire
the big hero here.

623
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,042
Sorry I can not publish it

624
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:49,511
But I do not publish  bad.

00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:53,413
Just one little story about how
and Kate went through the town.

626
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,283
It's hard to imagine you and my mother
fighting over the same man.

627
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,981
I knew I had no chance anyway.

628
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:03,026
Do not let him near the bases.

629
00:55:33,994 --> 00:55:35,461
What eat, man?

630
00:55:36,229 --> 00:55:37,491

You see the menu for 10 minutes.

632
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:42,493
Where says meatloaf?

633
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:45,896
Maybe they have.
Not have.

634
00:55:46,106 --> 00:55:47,437
Choose else.

635
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:49,831

00:56:00,353 --> 00:56:04,380
Chicken then.
ŻFrito or brisket?

641
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:07,385
Frito.
It will eat brisket.

642
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:09,488
Zto you ma'am?

643
00:56:09,696 --> 00:56:13,632
He thought  roast beef,
but I'm not sure.

644
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:16,097
What would you recommend me?

645
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:19,563
All is good, but
recommend the tilapia.

646
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,167
No, I want roast beef.

647
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,072
I want tilapia.

648
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,147
Do not forget to go to the bar
soups and salads.

649
00:56:41,895 --> 00:56:43,522
Ed Pegram is singing.

650
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:04,473
Always had a good voice.

651
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:07,278
Is the only good thing in that bastard.

652
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:09,045
Not so bad.
Do not you is it?

653
00:57:09,422 --> 00:57:12,823
ŻSupiste always wanted to mess with me?

654

Jesus, Mom, everything all the people wanted to seduce
?

655
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:20,460
These guys grew up watching the cows and pigs ass.

656
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:24,467
Is natural for a real woman
fools again.

657
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:27,697
Mom, do not talk about that stuff
before eating.

658
00:57:28,975 --> 00:57:31,739
You were always a sensitive boy.

659
00:57:32,278 --> 00:57:33,836
And very nice.

660
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:38,549
When you were a baby
people stopped me on the street.

661
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:40,879
Y
I said you were beautiful.

662
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:43,117

Thank you.
Heart of Gold.

686
00:59:12,178 --> 00:59:14,339
Not a secret,
he drank and when...

687
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:19,177
Workshop had ruined many
work and wasted money.

688
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,816
He was older than I,
like a big brother.

689
00:59:25,592 --> 00:59:28,083
I wanted to show my respect.

690
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:30,289
So I
I paid a lot of money.

691
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:32,021
But I never gave it back.

692
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:36,998
Well considering that money will soon.

Fair enough.

That arregláramos accounts.

696
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:47,437
You want your $ 800 back?

697
00:59:49,549 --> 00:59:50,880
Woody should me much more than that.

698
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:53,986
Sorry to tell you but

699
00:59:54,187 --> 00:59:55,654
My Dad did not win anything.

700
00:59:55,822 --> 00:59:57,585
Is a big misunderstanding.

701
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,951
You can understand that.

702
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:04,726
True, żentonces'll Lincoln
to you visit the museum?

703
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:06,656
Look at David.

704
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:09,098
Not want to have to
get a lawyer on this.

David.

708
01:00:18,578 --> 01:00:22,378
I'm a man with a strong sense of
good and evil.

709
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,645
If Woody earned money.

710
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,241
I do not see anything.

711
01:00:26,452 --> 01:00:27,646
That would be wrong.

712
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:29,983
I'll fix it.

713
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:35,253
Are you threatening my family?

714
01:00:36,162 --> 01:00:37,686
ŻAmenazando? No.

715
01:00:38,598 --> 01:00:39,792
That would be wrong.

716
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,668
I'm the victim here.

717
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:46,668
We're just talking.

718
01:00:48,474 --> 01:00:51,272
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to pee
.

719
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:54,378
You know how that goes.

720
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:09,526
Good to see you again,
are happy for you.

721
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:11,761
Buy a boat and go fishing
.

722
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,023
That's what I would do.

723
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:14,530
I'll remember.

724
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:19,628
David may not remember Kathy and Dale.

725
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:21,733
Hi, how are you?
- Hello.

726
01:01:22,475 --> 01:01:23,601
David Grant.

727
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,176
Never would have recognized.

728
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:28,870
're A beautiful man.

729
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:30,613

Ż You see?

731
01:01:32,118 --> 01:01:34,018
As a prince made of porcelain.

732
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:36,155
Thank you.
- Well...

733
01:01:36,356 --> 01:01:37,414
Beware.

734
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:41,285
Enjoy.

735
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:48,928
I just had an interesting conversation with Ed Peagram
.

736
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:51,194
What did he want?
Some of the money from my father.

737
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:53,997
Can I pay about $
if needed.

738
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:56,808
Of course not.

739
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:30,439
Hey you, wake up.

740
01:02:32,478 --> 01:02:33,706
Wake up now.

741
01:02:35,315 --> 01:02:36,407
What about Dad?

742
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:38,678
ŻIremos Lincoln today?

743
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:40,279
Tomorrow.

744
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,882
Why not today?

745
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:44,223
Today is Sunday,
is closed.

746
01:02:45,058 --> 01:02:46,923
All your brothers coming today, remember?

747
01:02:47,994 --> 01:02:49,325
Some are dead.

748
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:51,592
The dead do not come.

749
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:59,633
Damn but claim they will give that money to another.

750
01:03:03,376 --> 01:03:04,570
Hey Dad.

751
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:08,710
Do you remember that with which you were dating, Peg?

752
01:03:09,282 --> 01:03:10,943
Who?
Peg Bender.

753
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:13,879
No, when?

754
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:15,982
Last week.
How do you ask that?

755
01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:17,747
Years ago before they marry you.

756
01:03:20,793 --> 01:03:22,055
Was a long time ago.

757
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,329
Why mention it?

758
01:03:51,657 --> 01:03:54,285
Not see your children Martha.

759
01:03:54,494 --> 01:03:55,893
Where are they?

760
01:03:57,497 --> 01:03:59,624

What's the difference?
A very big.

767
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:16,945
Cole can explain it better than me.

768
01:04:17,383 --> 01:04:18,816
Bart does not have to be there.

769
01:04:19,018 --> 01:04:20,280
He is a volunteer.

770
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,414
That's good.

771
01:04:29,762 --> 01:04:31,889

Chevy Impala you had.

774
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:40,428
I never had a Impala.

775
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:45,168
Do not know what it was then.

776
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:53,684
Had a Buick.

777
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:56,047
That's what it was.

778
01:04:57,123 --> 01:04:58,283
Zaun driving that?

779
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:00,290
I have not done in years.

780
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:03,286
Still thought you were.

781
01:05:08,301 --> 01:05:09,928
Was 78, right?

782
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,103
From 79.

783
01:05:12,972 --> 01:05:15,668
From the 79, those were good cars.

784
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,438
Was fine.

785
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:21,342
I no longer do so.

786
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:24,743
These cars lasted forever.

787
01:05:27,887 --> 01:05:29,149
What happened?

788
01:05:29,722 --> 01:05:30,916
Stopped working.

789
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:34,753
Yes, do that.

790
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:37,791
Hello?

791
01:05:37,997 --> 01:05:39,157

Hello everyone.

793
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:47,638

794
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:50,233

Chicago and Detroit.

797
01:05:58,017 --> 01:05:59,644
How long took you driving?

798
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:13,889
Uncle Woody.

799
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,692
Ż you talked to the newspaper?

800
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:17,993
Yet.

801
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:20,638
I do not take my picture.

802
01:06:21,707 --> 01:06:23,675
I went to the office early.

803
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,846
How does it feel to be a millionaire Woody?

804
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:33,477
Okay.

805
01:06:34,287 --> 01:06:35,652
A million dollars.

806
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:37,950
Can you imagine?

807
01:06:38,558 --> 01:06:40,958
Drink to Woody.

808
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:48,694
I do not want to ruin the party but

809
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,334
all know this is

810
01:06:50,536 --> 01:06:52,800
a farce, gained nothing.

811
01:06:54,073 --> 01:06:55,199
Nice try  Ross.

812
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:56,768
're Past that.

813
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:59,077
Ross is right,
gained nothing.

814
01:06:59,645 --> 01:07:01,875
Try to keep it secret so that

815
01:07:02,081 --> 01:07:03,673
not come to ask for money.

816
01:07:04,216 --> 01:07:05,513
I understand.

817
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:08,119
True, Woody is not a millionaire yet
.

818
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,788
We should all remember that.

819
01:07:10,423 --> 01:07:12,220
But tomorrow will be a different story
.

820
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:16,989
What is the first thing you will do with the money
Woody?

821
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:18,754
First.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

822
01:07:20,232 --> 01:07:21,460
Buy A truck

823
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:23,163
and a compressor.

824
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,062
What will you do with a compressor?

825
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:28,501
Need paint.

826
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,501
ŻSeguirás you working?

827
01:07:32,545 --> 01:07:33,773
No.

828
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:36,312
only must replace the compressor that Ed was

829
01:07:36,616 --> 01:07:39,414
Why do not you
for him while you're in town?

830
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:43,383
Come on David.

831
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:45,580
Guys will not do that.

832
01:07:45,925 --> 01:07:48,393
I will shoot  for
old piece of junk.

833
01:07:48,995 --> 01:07:51,555
Am I the only string in this family?

834
01:07:52,498 --> 01:07:53,522
Ok, Mom. All right.

835
01:07:54,634 --> 01:07:57,432
But Ross thought to drive later.

836
01:07:57,637 --> 01:07:58,934
To see the old house
dad.

837
01:07:59,071 --> 01:08:00,368
That house.

838
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,968
You still still there?

839
01:08:02,341 --> 01:08:04,138
There is a farm there.

840
01:08:04,343 --> 01:08:05,503
But never demolished.

841
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:07,106
's Still there.

842
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,713
Why want to waste their time watching that?

843
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:11,816
Must be filled with rats.

844
01:08:12,385 --> 01:08:15,252
Papa, will you go see it?

845
01:08:16,389 --> 01:08:17,481
What?

846
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,917
David and I want to see where you grew up.

847
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,154
Why?

848
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:44,273
What makes the man?

849
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:47,810
Just go to the cars pass.

850
01:08:49,088 --> 01:08:51,056
Remember when we were kids

851
01:08:51,223 --> 01:08:54,124
and we had chairs all afternoon to see the track?

852
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:56,689
Yes

853
01:08:56,896 --> 01:08:58,921
Hello David, Hello Ross.

854
01:09:00,132 --> 01:09:02,726
Good to see you guys again.

855
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:05,931
We can not let so much time pass
again.

856
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:09,536
Yes Thanks Aunt Betty, good to see.

857
01:09:10,643 --> 01:09:13,840
But something is
hard to say.

858
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:16,681
Feel it deserves to be mentioned.

859
01:09:17,049 --> 01:09:18,073
What?

860
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:20,080
Good.

861
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:23,084
Well you know...

862
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:25,120
Woody has always had money problems.

863
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:27,690
The family helped him occasionally.

864
01:09:28,828 --> 01:09:30,455
So in view of their good fortune.

865
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:34,165
We think your family would

866
01:09:35,034 --> 01:09:36,228
fix things.

867
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:38,469
've Heard that quite lately.

868
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:42,898
You know, Cole and my people would not say anything if you only
out for them but,

869
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:45,338
are in this too.

870
01:09:46,445 --> 01:09:48,106
ŻDicen they want money from us?

871
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:50,278
Well because we think...

872
01:09:50,483 --> 01:09:52,144
Family
Woody took over and that.

873
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:54,050
I stood tall.

874
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:58,350
We help and we were quite rich.

875
01:09:58,524 --> 01:10:00,253
But it was my brother.

876
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:02,427
Could not bear to see the suffering family.

877
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:04,389
Aunt Betty Listen, guys...

878
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:07,531
To be frank and honest.

879
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:09,565
Woody gained nothing.

880
01:10:09,735 --> 01:10:11,293
Is a farce.

881
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:15,171
're A fucking liar.
Do not give me that Ross.

882
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:17,970
You wanna fight?

883
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:19,837
Let's do it.

884
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:26,584
Watch my face,
'm on TV.

885
01:10:34,627 --> 01:10:35,855
What is it?

886
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:38,427
Have they gone mad?

887
01:10:39,932 --> 01:10:42,560
Aunt Betty and his thugs
request repairs.

888
01:10:43,269 --> 01:10:44,361
Why?

889
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,505
's "" Profit "" Dad.
They say we owe them money.

890
01:10:48,174 --> 01:10:49,664
You see, no money?.

891
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,240
Money?

892
01:10:51,644 --> 01:10:53,703
Betty  What are you talking?

893
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,876
Help Woody know
when taken everything he earned.

894
01:10:59,251 --> 01:11:01,879
You know as well as I was
backwards.

895
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:05,352
They did work on your car for free.

896
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:06,547
They got free fuel.

897
01:11:06,759 --> 01:11:09,751
Not ask for much, only
symbolic.

898
01:11:09,962 --> 01:11:11,486
I took records.

899
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,088
The money they gave him no
approaches what you are owed.

900
01:11:15,668 --> 01:11:17,659
I could not tell anyone not
.

901
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:19,265
That ruined.

902
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:21,937
I think you're delusional.

903
01:11:22,341 --> 01:11:24,468
Where do you think you got that money when

904
01:11:24,677 --> 01:11:28,169
you went and opened that room?

905
01:11:28,714 --> 01:11:32,150
From my parents when they died.

906
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:34,742
I can not believe what they do.

907
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:39,052
Usually a person has to die before ronden
vultures.

908
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:42,053
Worry, we did not want to imply anything
.

909
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:45,620
It was just a courtesy before
speaking directly with Woody.

910
01:11:46,165 --> 01:11:50,033
Not dare to ask for money.

911
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:51,903
Is not poor, he is rich.

912
01:11:52,104 --> 01:11:54,800
Even if you were not you would
a dime.

913
01:11:55,007 --> 01:11:56,872
Not allow it.

914
01:11:57,076 --> 01:11:59,203
Maybe not up to you,
Aunt Kate.

915
01:11:59,411 --> 01:12:00,503
Enough.

916
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,707
Listen carefully.

917
01:12:03,582 --> 01:12:07,518
Can go fuck each other.

918
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:10,780
Guys, go by his father.

919
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:47,580
What do you think man?

920
01:13:48,187 --> 01:13:49,586
It looks almost the same.

921
01:13:50,122 --> 01:13:51,453
That is true.

922
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:53,625
Here's how your mother did.

923
01:13:58,897 --> 01:14:00,728
My dad built this place.

924
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,525
Really?

925
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:05,633
Yourself Why?

926
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:08,132
Yes, before I was born.

927
01:14:10,142 --> 01:14:11,473
His brothers helped him.

928
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:48,873
I can.

929
01:14:57,756 --> 01:14:58,984
This was my room.

930
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:03,293
That's where Brother Woody died
.

931
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:07,224
Remember that  Daddy?

932
01:15:09,835 --> 01:15:10,995
Right.

933
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:48,072
This was the room of my parents.

934
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,139
They hit if he came here.

935
01:15:57,783 --> 01:15:59,375
Guess nobody is going to hit me now.

936
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:13,792
The barn is still standing.

937
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,586
Zya seen enough?

938
01:16:44,096 --> 01:16:45,120
Guess.

939
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:48,996
Just a bunch of old stuff.

940
01:16:57,009 --> 01:16:58,943
Ever wanted to be a farmer
like your father?

941
01:17:03,348 --> 01:17:04,747
Not remember.

942
01:17:06,785 --> 01:17:07,979
Not matter.

943
01:17:27,873 --> 01:17:29,841
There's the old farm hares.

944
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:34,572
She is dead and in the nursing
Valentine.

945
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,305
One son still lives there.

946
01:17:43,088 --> 01:17:45,955
Ahi is the place right Ed.

947
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:52,390
What are you doing?

948
01:17:53,332 --> 01:17:54,424
Let's do it.

949
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:55,692
're Here.

950
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:58,227
What do they want?

951
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:01,502
Papa, do not you want to see if you still have your
compressor?

952
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:56,052
Enough of this nonsense .

953
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:54,582
Dad,
finally have your compressor back.

954
01:19:57,556 --> 01:19:59,183
That's not my compressor.

955
01:19:59,991 --> 01:20:01,015
Yes it is.

956
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:04,051
Mine did not look well.

957
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:06,025
Has to be yours.

958
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:08,722
Is an old compressor that found in the barn of Ed

959
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:11,664
That was not the barn Ed

960
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,599
you talking about.

961
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:16,535
It was the home of Westendorf.

962
01:20:16,742 --> 01:20:18,141
Oh yeah you're right.

963
01:20:18,343 --> 01:20:20,937
Clear the Westendorf .

964
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:23,910
Ed lives closer to the people.

965
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:26,380
I got confused.

966
01:20:26,585 --> 01:20:28,780
Ed's wife, Dorothy.

967
01:20:28,987 --> 01:20:30,579
Oh My! sow that was it.

968
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:33,724
Anything you want to say about the Western
old?

969
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:35,893
No, are good people.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

970
01:20:36,094 --> 01:20:38,654
They had hard times.

971
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:42,561
Lost a son,
almost run out of money.

972
01:20:42,768 --> 01:20:45,236
But they worked hard and saved the farm.

973
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:50,773
deserved what you did to them.

974
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:53,706
Papa did not you tell us that
that was not the home of Ed?

975
01:20:53,912 --> 01:20:56,039
Did not know what the hell.

976
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:59,217
Have you ever seen our
steal a machine before?

977
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:01,716
I never know what they are doing.

978
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,787
Why do not you say it was not yours?

979
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,514
I thought you wanted it.

980
01:21:06,725 --> 01:21:09,387
For what would we want an old compressor?

981
01:21:09,594 --> 01:21:12,028
That was what I could not understand.

982
01:22:23,368 --> 01:22:28,328
Hi George, Hello Jean.

983
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,974

Well, we were going and thought we should greet

We have not been to Hawthorne
for a long time.

987
01:22:41,386 --> 01:22:43,251
What are you doing in the back seat?

988
01:22:46,558 --> 01:22:50,688
We were resting here
back until it appeared.

989
01:22:50,896 --> 01:22:53,456
Not you going to come visit?

990
01:22:53,665 --> 01:22:58,068
Sorry, we only have time to say hello and follow

Living.

994
01:23:06,878 --> 01:23:09,278
Are they still living in Montana?

995
01:23:09,481 --> 01:23:11,346
Zen Billings not?

996
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,847
Right.

997
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:15,679
You still hairdresser Kate?

998
01:23:15,887 --> 01:23:18,185
No, stop that.

Hello little David,

1015

How you doing  cowboy?

1016
01:25:22,881 --> 01:25:24,712
Was all right.

1017
01:25:29,921 --> 01:25:33,015
Chatter is enough it's time to talk business.

1018
01:25:33,224 --> 01:25:39,823
Woody told your son not mind using something like
of your winnings.

1019
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:43,330
To even things out with your old friend Ed

1020
01:25:43,535 --> 01:25:45,196
How much you need?

1021
01:25:45,403 --> 01:25:47,633

10000 Dale dad.

1025
01:25:57,215 --> 01:25:59,012
I do not have yet.

1026
01:25:59,217 --> 01:26:02,618
Woody ,
I always thought we were friends.

1027
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:06,450
Remember it was you who convinced you to stay with
Kate.

1028
01:26:06,658 --> 01:26:10,219
If David, your dad wanted a divorce.

1029
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:13,022
Why
was fucking a girl in the bathroom.

1030
01:26:13,231 --> 01:26:14,220
I thought I was in love.

1031
01:26:14,432 --> 01:26:15,990
Woody Is not that right?

1032
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:25,336
When was this dad?

1033
01:26:25,543 --> 01:26:28,341
After Ross was born before you.

1034
01:26:28,546 --> 01:26:31,743
If I had not been here
possibly you were not here.

1035
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,713
At the time
divorce was a sin.

1036
01:26:33,918 --> 01:26:36,148
Now I guess it's okay.

1037
01:26:36,354 --> 01:26:38,288
God must have changed his opinion or something.

1038
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:42,586
Though do not blame Woody.

1039
01:26:42,794 --> 01:26:46,286
Because Kate was always a fucking.

1040
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:48,591
Away from us.

1041
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,233
I want that money.

1042
01:26:50,435 --> 01:26:51,424

Okay little David.

1044
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:55,532
Let's do it your way.

1045
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:01,770

We do not.

1058
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,294
Shut up.

1059
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:32,731
The throw.

We saw how stupid it was,
żmillonario?

1061
01:28:36,341 --> 01:28:38,673
What a joke, you are pathetic.

1062
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:09,729
Not mention anything about this to Mom or Ross

1063
01:29:09,941 --> 01:29:14,844
