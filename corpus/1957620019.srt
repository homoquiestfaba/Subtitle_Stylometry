00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,167
[music playing]

2
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,867
[gunshots]

3
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,600
You motherfucker.

4
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,167
[inaudible] You fuck.

5
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,533
[gunshots]

6
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,400
[gunshots]

7
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,767
[sirens]

8
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,100
Yeah, burn, you asshole, burn.

9
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,367
Who are you calling
an asshole, you prick.

10
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,900
Now drop the gun
before I blow a hole

11
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,267
in a more appropriate place.

12
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,267
[police radio]

13
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:10,133
Hold the flashlight
still, will you?

14
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,633
Can anybody find the lights?

15
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,633
I don't believe this.

16
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,467
God.

17
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,800
Oh, check it out.

18
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
Let there be light.

19
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Hey, I got if from a Chinese
lady across the street.

20
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
Great, bring it over here.

21
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,633
Hey, Turner, isn't it
a little cold for Hawaii?

22
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,867
Oh, yeah.

23
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,467
I left my jacket in
the car with Bobby.

24
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh, that's nasty.

25
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,267
Wing [inaudible].

26
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:40,600
Yeah, it's a hell of a mess.

27
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,400
And you can forget
about fingerprints.

28
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,933
Blue coats fucked us
on this one again.

29
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,533
Guys, how many times
do I have to tell you,

30
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:49,933
do not touch anything
until we get here?

31
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,967
We didn't.

32
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,900
[phone ringing]

33
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Well, you might
as well answer it.

34
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,700
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's here.

35
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Hang on.

36
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,533
It's for you.

37
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,200
It's an Officer Vanelli.

38
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,133
Yeah.

39
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,500
I got the son of a bitch.
Yeah, that's right.

40
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,667
He was holding.

41
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:16,933
And guess what?

42
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,833
He had a fun gun on him.

43
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:19,767
Yeah, all right.

44
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,133
All right, yeah.

45
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:24,000
You're going to have to
sell me over a blue coat.

46
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,967
Hold on one second.

47
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,833
Ah, shit, it's one of
those fucked up phones.

48
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,900
Man, I can't read the address.

49
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hold on.

50
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,767
Yeah, 1621 Curden.

51
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:49,433
It all leads back to my
brother's original story.

52
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,400
Oh, and do me a favor.

53
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,033
Get my jacket out of the
car before they tow it, OK?

54
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,333
Oh, your jacket.

55
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,200
Yeah, I'll get it
out of the car.

56
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,100
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

57
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't' know what the
fuck you're talking about.

58
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,267
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

59
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,533
--right out of the socket.

60
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,400
It wasn't $50 though.

61
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,867
It was a bad ass [inaudible].

62
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,667
All right, real bad.

63
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,400
It's funny What people do
when their sense of perception

64
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,267
gets fucked up.

65
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,600
So tell me exactly
what happened when you

66
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,767
got to the scene of the crime.

67
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, let's see now.

68
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,767
I told the guy to
empty his pockets

69
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,433
and give me all of his money.

70
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,167
I want to see my attorney,
and I want to make a phone call.

71
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,400
Did you say something?

72
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,433
Yeah, I want to see
my fucking attorney.

73
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,733
I didn't think so.

74
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,867
So give me all your money.

75
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,600
Then what happened?

76
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's see, then I--

77
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,500
oh, yeah, that's right,
I put a gun to his head,

78
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,133
and I blew a hole in it.

79
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,267
Wow, now that's intense.

80
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,333
I got to get this down.

81
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,900
I put a-- yeah, now talk
about pre-meditative, man.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,333
The jury's going to love this.

83
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,767
Say, what's your name again?

84
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,833
Fuck you.

85
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,067
No, fuck you, Clarence.

86
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,767
I just went over your rap sheet.

87
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,333
It took me an hour and a half.

88
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:25,333
January 25, 1978, extortion
and due process, conviction,

89
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,933
released 30 days later
for good behavior.

90
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:32,633
March 25, 1981, armed
robbery, no conviction,

91
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:36,200
released 22 days later
after incarceration.

92
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,233
Hey, is this guy a snitch?

93
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,533
Why is he getting
released so quick?

94
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,433
Are you a song and
dance man, Clarence?

95
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,100
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

96
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,567
What's the deal, Clarence?

97
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,167
I don't like getting shot
at, only more than you do.

98
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,033
But there's one thing
I really fucking hate,

99
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,500
and that's my fucking shoe.

100
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
I want to know one thing.

101
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,133
Where did you get the
gun from, Clarence?

102
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,200
Fuck you.

103
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,733
No, fuck you, Clarence.

104
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:12,033
We're talking about the fun
gun, pal, the police issue?

105
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,233
See my partner doesn't
care about murder,

106
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,300
but he's really into guns.

107
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,733
I'm talking about
the gun you were using

108
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,833
target practice on me with.

109
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,033
I'm going to leave
you two guys alone

110
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,567
for a little while, all right?

111
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,933
I got to take a leak.

112
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,767
You going to be
all right, Turner?

113
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,133
Hey, wait a minute,
you can't leave

114
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,867
me alone in here with this guy.

115
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:33,933
There's got to be a witness.

116
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,367
That's illegal.

117
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:38,033
Clarence, babe, we all
bend the law once in a while.

118
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:41,633
You of all people
should know that.

119
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:42,933
Hey, wait a minute.

120
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,433
You can't leave me alone
in here with this guy.

121
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,000
That's illegal.
There's not to be a witness.

122
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Hey, wait a minute.

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, [inaudible],, how
are you doing, buddy?

124
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,667
Get that heroine
problem fixed yet?

125
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:18,433
There's nothing I hate more
than a jail house snitch.

126
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,433
But I guess some people are
just too lazy to do their jobs.

127
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,633
You taking good care
of Lieutenant here,

128
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:28,267
I hope, because Lieutenant
Parker has his troubles

129
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,200
trying to find his way around.

130
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,833
Well, maybe if your
brother was here,

131
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,633
I could buy your directions.

132
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,067
Hey, fuck you, Clark.

133
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,900
If it wasn't for my brother,
you'd still be writing

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,133
parking tickets on Sunset.

135
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,933
Well, the pay wasn't
as good, but at least

136
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,067
I can still sleep at night.

137
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,167
This way.

138
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,000
Everything's still
on for tomorrow, right?

139
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,900
Yeah, everything's
going as planned.

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,367
I even talked to the governor.

141
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,733
Thank god, your brother's
still got some friends left.

142
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,333
Yeah, some friends.

143
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,267
The governor would hang
his own mother if there

144
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:10,767
was a re-election in it.

145
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,600
Look, you got to understand,
it's not too popular to be

146
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,700
defending a dishonest cop right
now, especially when he killed

147
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,067
the mayor's 16-year-old son.

148
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,567
My brother didn't
kill anybody.

149
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,267
And don't give me
that honesty crap.

150
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,633
We all have to draw the line
somewhere and you know that.

151
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm sorry, Frank.

152
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,400
Jeez.

153
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,733
Hey, nice suit.

154
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,833
Is it new?

155
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,733
Always with the jokes.

156
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,800
How are you doing, kid?

157
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,233
Yeah, work sucks.

158
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,233
Me and Turner are on graffiti
patrol again this week,

159
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,000
but what else is new?

160
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, let's face it,
they don't exactly like it

161
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,167
when you blow up your car.

162
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,167
Yeah, word travels
fast around here, huh?

163
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah, around here
it's the only thing

164
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,633
that does travel fast.

165
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,233
How's Turner doing?

166
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,933
Ah, he's doing all right.

167
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,300
But he still won't do a visit.

168
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,533
Like I said, it's all right.

169
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:04,833
You tell that little
punk when I see him,

170
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,133
I'm going to kick his ass.

171
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,733
The next time, I'm
blaming everything on him.

172
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,067
You know this guy,
Clarence Dumont?

173
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,333
He's connected.

174
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:12,167
No.

175
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:13,900
Are you downstairs in H South?

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
I don't travel down south much.

177
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,067
It's mostly transit
district stuff.

178
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,833
Yeah, tell me about it.

179
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,233
He's never done more
than six months.

180
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,933
And every time he's been
popped, it's been a felony.

181
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,667
He keeps on getting
off on technicals.

182
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,800
This is bullshit.

183
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,833
Anyway, I found
another gun on him.

184
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,667
- [inaudible]?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,700
County or state issue?

186
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,767
It was a county.

187
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,233
It's automatic.

188
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,500
It's got the serial numbers
filed off and everything.

189
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
But this one's a
little different.

190
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,933
This one's fresh.

191
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,000
It couldn't be more
than a week old.

192
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,167
That makes seven,
including yours.

193
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,500
Well, hopefully
after tomorrow,

194
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,767
it's not going to matter.
Where's Frank?

195
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,267
He had to leave.

196
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,133
He wasn't feeling too good.

197
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,700
Hey, but anyway, look.

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,533
You said everything's going to
be all right for tomorrow, OK?

199
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,900
And if this gun thing--

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Forget about the
gun thing, Bobby.

201
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,933
Look, I feel pretty
good about tomorrow too.

202
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,700
It's been two years.

203
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,367
[inaudible] about enough.

204
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,633
Do you want me to
get anything for you?

205
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:06,733
You can get me out of here.

206
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,500
That's about it.

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,200
OK, anyway, take
care of yourself, Roy.

208
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,533
Take care of myself,
that's easy part.

209
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,667
The cops are the
sickest fucks in here.

210
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,033
I wish that was a joke.

211
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,733
Yeah, so do I.

212
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,567
[inaudible]

213
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,567
[music playing]

214
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,333
NEWS ANCHOR [on tv]:: And
additional information

215
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:57,167
on the case and time
served on the trial

216
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:01,267
may bring the release of Officer
Vanelli in tomorrow's hearing.

217
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,167
The attorney's of
Officer Vanelli

218
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,100
have proposed the
new detectives never

219
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,967
actually caught up with
the young [inaudible]

220
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,233
the night of his death.

221
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,300
However, [inaudible]
reports have positively

222
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,133
identified the murder weapon as
the police issued [inaudible]

223
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,700
assigned to Detective Vanelli.

224
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,867
I can't fucking believe
he's late already.

225
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,667
Something's wrong.

226
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:33,533
Something's terribly wrong here.

227
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,167
Just hang on, pal.

228
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,567
He's going to be
here any minute.

229
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:37,500
Excuse me.

230
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,467
Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli?

231
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,400
No, no.

232
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
That's Vanelli.

233
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, excuse me.

234
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,967
Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli?

235
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,900
I'm from the public
defenders office.

236
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,633
Yeah, so?

237
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:52,967
My name is Evelyn Kurtz.

238
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,067
I was appointed by the
city of Los Angeles

239
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,733
to serve as Thomas
Vanelli's attorney.

240
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,100
I am correct in assuming
that you are his brother.

241
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,367
Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli, I'm
afraid I'm going to be late.

242
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:08,367
There's not much time and I need
to find out some information

243
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:09,933
regarding arrangements
that were made

244
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,833
during the preliminary
hearings and also

245
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,133
any other pertinent
information that you

246
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,900
might have regarding this case.

247
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,900
What the fuck
is going on here?

248
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,133
Excuse me?

249
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,333
No, excuse me.

250
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,133
I seem to be missing
something here.

251
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,167
My brother and I already
have counsel on retainer.

252
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:27,800
There must be some
extremely bad mistake.

253
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,467
Excuse me, Mr.
Vanelli, but I'm

254
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,300
afraid the only mistake here
is that you obviously have

255
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,167
not been informed properly.

256
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,200
Were you aware that
Franklin Damato

257
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,800
was admitted to
USC Medical Center

258
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,800
late last night with a
serious pulmonary disorder?

259
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,433
Christ, Turner,
get to a phone.

260
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:46,733
Call a hospital.

261
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,900
I don't give a damn if he's
on the operating table.

262
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,900
Just get through to him.

263
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,667
Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli.

264
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,833
I'm afraid we're going to have
to make some sort of motion

265
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,733
here.

266
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,867
I need some information.

267
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:57,767
Stop it.

268
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:58,933
I'll make it easy, OK?

269
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,133
You're completely
out of line here.

270
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,333
You want information?

271
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,233
Call 411.

272
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,633
I've got my brother
with his head

273
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,567
on a chopping block in there.

274
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,467
And there isn't any time to
chitchat with some law student

275
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,167
about how fucked up
the legal system is.

276
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:19,800
Listen, Mr. Vanelli, I
talked to the district attorney

277
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,300
this afternoon.

278
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,067
I got him to lean back a little
bit on anything that might

279
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,567
make the press a little hungry.

280
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:29,100
We can get 30-day extension
of cause and effect, no loss

281
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,867
or lean against the
plaintiff's rights.

282
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,800
Ryan went for that?

283
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:45,167
Let's just say he's a
friend of mine, an old friend.

284
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,067
We'll have another
pitcher, babe.

285
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,933
Right, and we'll have
another Coke, please.

286
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,467
Fucking Frank.

287
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,100
Here's to Frank, a hell of an
attorney when he's not sick.

288
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,667
God, is she gifted.

289
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:09,967
She's [inaudible] experience.

290
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,433
She's out of her league.

291
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,933
Bobby, she is hardly
out of her league.

292
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah, but it's incredible.

293
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,867
A man's life is at stake here.

294
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,800
It's murder.

295
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
That's just the point.

296
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,900
I don't want anything
to do with it.

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,967
Oh, Bobby, how
can you say that?

298
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,200
It's simple.

299
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,733
First of all, she's
a fucking yuppie.

300
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,600
And second of all, I don't
think she has enough experience.

301
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,200
Well, all right, here
we have to disagree.

302
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,600
First of all, she
is not a yuppie.

303
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,400
And secondly, I think she
has plenty of experience.

304
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,333
Oh, forget it.

305
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,933
I've got somebody
else on the way,

306
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,500
an old friend of the family.

307
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,533
But Tom's just too ashamed
to ask her, I guess.

308
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:48,600
So I'll do it.

309
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,433
I don't let that
bullshit stand in my way.

310
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,100
I just don't think Evelyn
has enough experience,

311
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,267
don't you think Turner?

312
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,567
Evelyn?

313
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,533
Yeah, I guess.

314
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:01,533
Can have a beer, please?

315
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,067
Forget it, forget it.
Never mind.

316
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,233
Never mind.

317
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,700
Look, I've got to
get this guy home.

318
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,933
He's still on duty.

319
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,700
On duty, are we?

320
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,967
Well, at least I am.

321
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,433
I got to call in for you, OK?
OK, come on.

322
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,400
Let's go.

323
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,033
No, I want to stay.
Man, go ahead.

324
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,000
You go on without me.

325
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,067
I'm going to hang out.

326
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,567
I'll get a cab,
or I'll get a ride

327
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,867
from somebody or something.

328
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:33,867
Go ahead.
- You sure?

329
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:34,867
- Yeah.
- Fine.

330
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,067
Fine.

331
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,233
Look, do me a favor,
you take it easy.

332
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,100
Don't let this guy
drive the cab, OK?

333
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,100
Take it easy, Turner.

334
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,000
[music playing]

335
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,367
Tonight, all members of the
Los Angeles Police Department

336
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:09,100
get a special two for one at
the bar with tropical drinks.

337
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,133
Wow, you're really
knocking those down, cowboy.

338
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:30,100
Yeah, I certainly am.

339
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,333
What do you
think you're doing,

340
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,567
going through those purse.
- No, you don't understand.

341
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:11,500
Yeah, right.

342
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,067
What the hell are
you doing that?

343
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:58,233

[scream]

348
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,567
Get up against the wall.

349
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,033
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

350
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,100
This little weasel was
going through the purse.

351
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
You're not calling my
little Roger a thief, are you?

352
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
You're Roger?

353
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,633
[inaudible]

354
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:08,600
Fuck you, [inaudible].

355
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,600
[interposing voices]

356
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,567
Shit.

357
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,567
Dammit.

358
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,967
Sit down, man.

359
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,933
Fuck you, man.

360
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,533
Shut up, my man.

361
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,933
Fuck you.

362
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,900
Damn fucking rednecks.

363
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,900
Look at these guys.

364
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,867
[interposing voices]

365
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,967
Hey, homie, you got a problem?

366
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,733
Shut up.

367
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,067
My problem's you, man.

368
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,533
You shut up.
- Fuck you.

369
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:38,500
Vanelli?

370
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Release.

371
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,367
If if wasn't for
you, I wouldn't

372
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:51,500
be in this fucking place, man.

373
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,833
Hey, fuck you, dude?

374
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,367
You got a problem, huh?

375
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:55,567
You want to start something?

376
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:56,667
Huh?

377
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:57,833
You want to start something?
- Get him, man.

378
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:58,433
Get him.
Get him.

379
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,100
Get him.

380
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
[interposing voices]

381
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,167
Luckily, the
didn't file a report.

382
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:07,633
I believe this is
the kind of thing

383
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:11,633
they put you on suspension
for a relatively long time.

384
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:14,033
As it is, I'm sure the
DA is already gotten

385
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,000
a little word about this.

386
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,700
Hey, I appreciate
the ride home.

387
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,933
But I didn't ask
for it, all right?

388
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,600
Oh, you didn't.

389
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,733
Well, once again, I'm afraid
you've been misinformed,

390
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,867
this time by your own memory.

391
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,267
I suppose you don't remember the
phone call you made last night

392
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,867
for a half hour free.

393
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,333
Free phone call?

394
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,167
Yeah, the free phone call.

395
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:39,100
You drooled in my ear so much,
you probably short circuited

396
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,433
the phone at the jail.

397
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,767
Shit, I did that.

398
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:46,700
I can't remember a thing.

399
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,100
Oh, that's refreshing.

400
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,600
No, it's not.

401
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,967
Trust me.

402
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:55,533
All right.

403
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:58,600
I think I will.

404
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,967
You will what?

405
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:03,600
I need somebody I can trust.

406
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,133
I need your help.

407
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,700
My brother needs your help.

408
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
This is it?

409
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,367
Yeah, this is it.

410
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:35,667
Listen, Mr. Vanelli, it
was in my best interest

411
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:38,067
to get you out of any long term
incarceration you might have

412
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:40,533
incurred after last
night's little escapade,

413
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:43,667
solely for the purpose of
keeping publicity at a minimum.

414
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,700
Now, as I informed you, I've
been assigned by the court

415
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,400
to represent your brother.

416
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,567
And any bad publicity we
must keep at a minimum.

417
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,367
Now, if you're so inclined
to discuss this case,

418
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:57,500
you can reach me at my office
during regular business hours.

419
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,333
[buzzer]

420
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,233
OK there's fresh
towels in the bathroom.

421
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,067
There's clean sheets on
the bed in the guest room.

422
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,633
You have anything
in the refrigerator

423
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,200
except the cherry yogurt.

424
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,467
And I'll be at the
office until 6:00.

425
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:43,200
Your landlord will
be home at 6:00.

426
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,433
So you'll be gone
when I get home.

427
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:47,900
And here's cab fare.

428
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,833
You can pay me back later.

429
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,267
Evelyn.

430
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,067
What?

431
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:55,900
Why are you doing this?

432
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,167
I read your brother's files.

433
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:00,300
I believe he's innocent.

434
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:02,967
[speaking spanish]

435
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,133
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:08,733
[speaking spanish] No

437
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:10,367
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,567
[inaudible] I saw
the cab already gone.

439
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:13,367
I thought you were gone.

440
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,433
No, I was taking a shower.

441
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,433
I'm sorry.

442
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,833
I'm really sorry.

443
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,200
I didn't mean to scare you.

444
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,600
I'm concerned that--
did you cut yourself?

445
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,933
Yeah, you scared
the hell out of me.

446
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:26,133
I jumped, but the razor didn't.

447
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,200
Here, let me take a look.

448
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Well, that's not so bad.

449
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,800
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

450
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,800
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

451
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,733
So how was your shower?

452
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,067
Did you have a nice shower?

453
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,567
Yeah, a great shower.

454
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,700
You have a nice shower.

455
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,833
Is it still bleeding?

456
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:10,967
I think so.

457
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,100
Here, here's a Band-aid.

458
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,033
No, no thanks.

459
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:15,100
I don't need it.

460
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,400
You should have
used my electric.

461
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,333
Yeah, electric.

462
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,900
I should get
that cab right now.

463
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,033
My landlord should
be home by now.

464
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:30,667
I can't believe I lost
my / that's got to be

465
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,267
the third time in two months.

466
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,800
Forget about the cab.

467
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,767
I'll drive you.

468
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,333
I went to your brother's
attorney's this afternoon.

469
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:43,967
Have you ever been to his house?

470
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:44,900
No, not really.

471
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,733
Is it a nice place?

472
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,967
Well, I'm not sure.

473
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:52,267
I may have been at
the wrong place.

474
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,600
Well, it's somewhere
in Beverly Hills, right?

475
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,967
Yeah.

476
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,767
He called and gave me the
address, 101 Dalmatian.

477
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:58,867
Oh, that's right.

478
00:38:58,967 --> 00:38:59,833
Yeah.

479
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:03,367
Yeah, like the Disney film.

480
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,200
Disney?

481
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,467
Yeah, "101 Dalmatians,"
don't you remember that?

482
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,900
I think that's a little
bit before my time.

483
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Why?
How old are you?

484
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,467
How old are you?

485
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,633
Old enough.

486
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,633
For what, to hang
out all night at nudey

487
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,067
bars drinking like a
delinquent teenager?

488
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:30,633
Listen, Evelyn, I can
find my own way home.

489
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,733
Wait a minute.

490
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,933
I went to the right place,
and no one was there.

491
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:45,867
I knocked on the
door for 20 minutes.

492
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,033
Well, what do you
want me to do about it.

493
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,467
You're the one that's
so damn clever.

494
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,033
Well, I thought he had a
[inaudible] or something.

495
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,467
It just didn't seem
right that I would go,

496
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,133
and he would ask me to
come over, and then not

497
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:55,100
be there for the appointment.

498
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,500
He does have a live-in nurse.

499
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,633
Maybe he got the time
wrong, or the address wrong.

500
00:39:58,733 --> 00:39:59,900
No, no, no.

501
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,133
It was 101 Dalmatian
right off of Burten Way.

502
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,700
Well, maybe he had
an attack or something.

503
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,833
Maybe he had to go
to the hospital.

504
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:04,967
I don't know.

505
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,133
Are you sure you
got the time right?

506
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:08,967
Come on.
Let me take you home.

507
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:11,767
I promise not to mention
last night again.

508
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,700
OK.

509
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,267
Thanks.

510
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,900
I called the hospital, and
they have no record of him

511
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,033
ever having been admitted.

512
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,167
I'd call my service,
but I've already

513
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:22,433
called them three times.

514
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:23,667
[inaudible]

515
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:24,967
OK, thanks.

516
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:25,700
Well, wait a minute, is
the red light flashing?

517
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,367
Yeah, it is.

518
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,200
I hate it when nobody
leaves a message.

519
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,333
Nice place.

520
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:41,533
Yeah, it's not my fault.
I know it's a little small.

521
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,033
Whenever I'm late with the
rent, my landlord's got

522
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,867
this giant crank downstairs.

523
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:51,700
And she gives it another turn,
and my walls move in tighter.

524
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,900
Yeah, hello?
Yeah, hi.

525
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,233
This is 266.
Any messages?

526
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,967
Uh-huh.

527
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,467
Uh-huh.

528
00:40:58,567 --> 00:40:59,233
Uh-huh, yeah.

529
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,767
OK, thank you very much.

530
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,200
Nothing.

531
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,467
It's too late to call him now.
- Well, what time is it?

532
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:06,533
1 o'clock.

533
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,067
No wonder why my
landlord was pissed off.

534
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,000
She's usually passed
out by 9 o'clock.

535
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,600
Thanks for dinner.

536
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,967
It was great.

537
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:25,100
So are you going to
keep your promise or what?

538
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,533
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

539
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:27,533
Sure.
Please, do it.

540
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:28,733
Please, sit down.

541
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,000
Sit down on the bed right here.

542
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Go ahead.

543
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,167
OK.

544
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:47,100
You see, now when you fire a
gun, only the tip of the bullet

545
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,267
leaves the barrel.

546
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,367
Here, let me show you.

547
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:50,867
No, thanks.

548
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,333
Oh, don't be afraid of it.

549
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:53,967
More people get
killed accidentally

550
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,167
because they're afraid of guns.

551
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,867
And you can imagine.

552
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:59,133
I've never held a gun before.

553
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:00,633
It's so heavy.

554
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:05,600
Yeah, it's made of solid
steel, except for the handle.

555
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,867
Now, basically, there are
three parts to a bullet, OK?

556
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,700
You've got the firing cap,
the shell casing, and the lid.

557
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,233
Right.

558
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:19,333
OK, now the hammer strikes
the firing pin inside the gun,

559
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:23,000
which in turn strikes the
primer, which sets off

560
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,933
an explosion in the casing,
which pops the lead off

561
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:28,167
at 155 feet per second.

562
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:30,367
Now, try to outrun that.

563
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,467
OK, but what about
that rifling thing

564
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:33,467
you were talking about?

565
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,100
Oh, yeah.

566
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,500
Well, you see, every barrel
has several small grooves,

567
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,467
slightly curved.

568
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,967
So the lead catches
on those grooves

569
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,867
and spins so that
the bullet will

570
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:48,933
travel straight and instead of
wobbling off any old direction.

571
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,200
See, now look at these pictures.

572
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,500
See, that was the
bullet that was

573
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,567
fired from Tom's gun in the lab
under controlled conditions.

574
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:01,733
Now that's the lead they took
out of Mayor Crenshaw's son.

575
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,200
Notice the match.

576
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,300
I do.

577
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,800
OK, but now what about
this one right here?

578
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,200
This one got flattened on
impact because it hit a bone.

579
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,733
See, most people
don't realize that,

580
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,100
but it's almost
impossible to get

581
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,367
a rifling match all the time.

582
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,633
See-- or this could have
been a hollow point,

583
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,367
or it could have been x'ed.

584
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:19,500
X'ed?

585
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,033
Well, that's when
somebody takes a hacksaw,

586
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,400
and saws an x in
a top of the lead.

587
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,867
See, and then the bullet
splits apart on impact.

588
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,467
Basically, it kills
people better.

589
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm impressed.

590
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,000
You certainly are
an expert on guns.

591
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
I'm no expert.

592
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,600
My brother, Tom,
he's the expert.

593
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,200
He taught me everything I know.

594
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,667
I got to hand it
to Frank, if this

595
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:50,100
is the kind of evidence
he's been up against, no

596
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,267
wonder he's not feeling good.

597
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:56,067
Yeah, it's quite dramatic.

598
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,500
It circumstantial.

599
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,967
But it's like first impressions.

600
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:08,133
You know how sometimes
you can be mistaken.

601
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,300
Yeah.

602
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:20,567
I seem to be constantly
learning that.

603
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,400
Me too.

604
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:43,533
Oh, you're home.

605
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:45,100
Sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

606
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,000
How did you get in here?

607
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,167
The door was unlocked.

608
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:49,333
Look, man, where
have you been, man?

609
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:50,700
I've been trying to
call you all day.

610
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,767
I was worried about you.

611
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,933
This better be important.

612
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:55,367
It is.

613
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:56,467
Bobby, Frank's been killed.

614
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:57,400
What?

615
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,433
Do you really think so?

616
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,267
Yeah, I think the
new dragon is 10

617
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,700
times better than the old one.

618
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,733
I don't know, maybe if
they use the same theme song.

619
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:07,633
They do.

620
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:08,567
No, they don't.

621
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,567
[singing], remember?

622
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,900
They don't use that.

623
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,700
I thought they used that.

624
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,833
You get anything good?

625
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:16,933
Just the facts,
man, just the facts.

626
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,300
That's good.

627
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Hey.

628
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,333
Hey, why don't you guys
do something useful?

629
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,533
Like what?

630
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:26,200
I don't know, get a
transfer off my department.

631
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:30,867
Excuse me, miss.

632
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:32,367
You can't come in here.
- It's OK.

633
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,933
She's with us.
- That's OK, miss.

634
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,233
Just go right ahead.

635
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,633
Just don't touch anything,
fingerprints, huh?

636
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,567
Yeah.

637
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:38,567
[inaudible]

638
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:39,467
OK.

639
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:20,233
How do you spell Penelope?

640
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,933
Is that with an E or an I?

641
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:23,367
With an E.

642
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:26,933
Maybe it stands for business
or something, like IBM.

643
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:30,300
Oh, no, no.
Maybe it stands for a gang.

644
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,367
I think we should visit
our buddy, Clarence's house.

645
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,467
I think he might be able
to translate this thing.

646
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:35,767
I doubt it.

647
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,300
I'm telling you, I'd beat
the living shit out of him.

648
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,333
He had absolutely
nothing to say.

649
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:42,133
It was like talking to
those towelheads in Iraq.

650
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,333
At least them, we could throw
them out of the helicopter

651
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:45,467
afterwards.

652
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:47,700
You guys really didn't
do that shit, did you?

653
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,300
Fuck them.

654
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,967
I can't believe they
stuck us with this car, man.

655
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:54,500
We're supposed to be undercover.

656
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,833
Well, I think Wilson's still
got a bug up his ass about you.

657
00:46:57,933 --> 00:46:59,800
You said we were
lucky to get this one.

658
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,200
This is ridiculous.

659
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,467
We might as well paint
this thing black and white.

660
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:07,000
Funny you should
mention painting.

661
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,333
Graffiti patrol.

662
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:09,433
Great.

663
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,233
I can't believe they
stuck us on this again.

664
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,700
Yeah, well, they still can't
believe what you did to his car

665
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,033
either.

666
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,600
Oh, catching Clarence
didn't count, right?

667
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,067
Hey, look, I thought
it was a great bust.

668
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,100
I got this great leather
jacket out of the deal

669
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,767
and you got those
fabulous new shoes.

670
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:26,267
Hey, that reminds me.

671
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:29,233
I got to stop at a Sears and
get me a pair of real shoes.

672
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:31,300
Do you know, is there a Sears
around here by any chance?

673
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,667
Somewhere.

674
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,933
But let's see, now we got
to look for Clarence Dumont.

675
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:37,500
And where's that at?

676
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,433
That's up right up here on the
corner of Crack and Eight Ball.

677
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah, let me see.

678
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,600
[record skipping]

679
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,733
Oh, Jesus Christ.

680
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:29,367
Come on, honey,
put the gun down.

681
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:30,133
Come on, honey.

682
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:31,733
Don't hurt yourself.

683
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,400
Put down that gun.

684
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,067
Put the gun down.

685
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,433
That's it.

686
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,400
Take it easy.

687
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,833
Just put the gun down, baby.
Come on.

688
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:40,033
Just drop the gun.

689
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,533
Come on, honey,
don't hurt yourself.

690
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:54,900
Fuck.

691
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,067
Call 911.

692
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,333
Fuck.

693
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:35,067
Don't even think about it
Clar-- put a clamp on it.

694
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,000
Against the wall.

695
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,500
Against the fucking wall.

696
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,733
You turn around, you're going
to lose your fucking dick.

697
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,000
Now how much shit
you got stashed

698
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,133
in this place, Clarence?

699
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,367
What are you
talking about, man?

700
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:45,467
I am clean.

701
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,633
You call accessory
to murder clean, man?

702
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,100
What are you talking about?

703
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
I want some fucking
answers, and I want them now.

704
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,533
And if you don't give me those
fucking answers right away,

705
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:55,567
your fingerprints are going to
be all over the murder weapon.

706
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,833
All right, man, what
do you want to know?

707
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:00,467
Well, it's a little late to
talk about the hazards of drug

708
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:01,933
abuse and your old lady.

709
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:04,400
So let's talk
about guns instead.

710
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,933
Let's start with the fucking
gun used on me last week,

711
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:08,367
and we'll end up with this one.

712
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:11,267
I don't know nothing
about no guns, man.

713
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:13,767
I'm telling you, I
don't know nothing.

714
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:15,333
Why don't you tell him, man?

715
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:18,433
I don't know nothing about
no guns, pure and simple.

716
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:25,267
He seems to like you.

717
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:26,900
Why don't you talk to
him while I go outside

718
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,033
and check his car out?

719
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:29,433
Hey, wait a minute.

720
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:32,033
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know, man.

721
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:41,033
We can make a deal,
man, a new deal.

722
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:43,400
A new deal?

723
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,600
Fuck, somebody's
in the car, man.

724
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,967
Make your deal with Turner.

725
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:48,733
And when I get back, I'll
see it it's workable.

726
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,000
Hey, don't touch
that dial or I'll

727
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,600
blow your fucking head off.

728
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,133
Put your hands on the wheel.

729
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,533
Where the hell did
you come from, man?

730
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:18,333
New York, originally,
but now I'm here.

731
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,000
Hey, fuck you.

732
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,333
[gunshot]

733
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,567
The fuck, he had a gun, man.

734
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,500
He tried to kill me.

735
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:28,567
Go after him.

736
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:30,000
I'll call it in.

737
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:36,000
Fuck.

738
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Fuck.

739
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,800
[sirens]

740
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,800
Son of a bitch, god dammit.

741
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,767
[inaudible], motherfucker.

742
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:12,767
[gunshot]

743
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:26,600
Get the fuck over, motherfucker.

744
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,733
Fuck you, you
cock-sucking fucking dick.

745
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,333
[gunshot]

746
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,633
Fuck.

747
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,600
[train whistle]

748
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,167
Oh, fuck.

749
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:27,567
Pull over.

750
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,833
[phone ringing]

751
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:44,867
Evelyn Kurtz's office.

752
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:46,667
May I take a message, please?

753
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:50,167
Yeah, is Evelyn Kurtz in?

754
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:52,033
Well, do you know what
time she'll be back?

755
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:54,067
Sir, I do not know when
she's going to get back.

756
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:55,167
If you'd like to
leave a message,

757
00:58:55,267 --> 00:58:56,267
I'll be happy to take a message.

758
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,700
Do you know where she went?

759
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,800
No, I do not, sir.

760
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,167
Would you care to
leave a message?

761
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:03,333
Don't you know anything?

762
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:05,833
I know one thing, that
you're extremely hostile.

763
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:09,467
Could you hold, please?

764
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:10,467
It's for you.

765
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:14,833
Oh, good.

766
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:16,100
You're there.

767
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,233
Look, I thought I'd
never get a hold of you.

768
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:22,700
Oh, right.

769
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,067
Great.

770
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,667
Hey, did he have anything
to say about my brother?

771
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:32,167
Listen, I've got something
I want to show you.

772
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:33,367
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

773
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:34,133
OK, but look.

774
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:36,533
Look, I need a favor.

775
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:37,600
I need a favor from you.

776
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,033
No, no, I'm on my
way to the jail now.

777
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:42,367
All right, OK.
I'll tell him.

778
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:43,433
I'll tell him.

779
00:59:43,533 --> 00:59:44,967
Look, you've got to
do something for me.

780
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:46,667
You've got to find something.

781
00:59:46,767 --> 00:59:50,200
I need to know this address.

782
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,100
Yeah, you've got a pen?

783
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:02,133
It's 3656 Sunswept Drive.

784
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:03,033
All right, yeah.

785
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:04,967
I'll see you later.

786
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:06,433
OK, bye.

787
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,167
You can't park here, miss.

788
01:01:40,267 --> 01:01:41,700
This is a private entrance.

789
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,467
And there's no parking anywhere
on this side of the canyon.

790
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:47,300
You'd get ticketed before you
unfastened your seat belt.

791
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,333
I'm sorry.

792
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:50,067
I couldn't seem to
get the car started.

793
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:55,833
Are you out of gas?

794
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:57,733
Oh, gee, I don't know.

795
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,933
I didn't even think to look.

796
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:02,067
I mean the gauge is all
the way to the right.

797
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:03,300
That's full, right?

798
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:09,067
Yes, ma'am, I believe it is.

799
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:12,367
Why don't you get out and
let me have a look at it.

800
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:13,733
Would you?

801
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:16,567
It's a new car, and I'm just
not even very used to it yet.

802
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,067
You know how that is.

803
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,600
Thank you.

804
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,133
It's no problem.

805
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,100
Is that you, Evelyn?

806
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,467
Mayor Crenshaw,
I don't believe it.

807
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:38,967
So what in the hell
are you doing up here?

808
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:41,233
I thought that was
you, but I wasn't sure.

809
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,833
Is that your
driveway I'm blocking?

810
01:02:43,933 --> 01:02:44,733
Oh, believe me.

811
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:45,900
I'm used to it.

812
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,333
This parking thing
is an ongoing deal.

813
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:51,400
Seems like no matter how
many parking bills I pass,

814
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,500
there's never any place
to park this damn boat.

815
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,100
They even towed me away.

816
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,300
I got to handcuff William to it.

817
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,367
Even then, I'll get
some wise rookie giving

818
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:02,733
me a ticket to make a point.

819
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,567
Ah, there's nothing to it.

820
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,600
Oh, thank you so much.

821
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,867
I'm really grateful.

822
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:11,000
It was sputtering all
the way down Sunset.

823
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:15,700
Well, listen, can I
invite you in for something?

824
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,333
Oh, Mayor, thank
you very much.

825
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:18,400
I'd love it.

826
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,267
But I've got court
early tomorrow morning.

827
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:22,800
You still doing PD work?

828
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,833
Yeah, I'm doing
specials for the county.

829
01:03:25,933 --> 01:03:27,133
No kidding.

830
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:28,733
Maybe I should get
your number in case

831
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:33,667
I get caught tearing up those
parking tickets of William's.

832
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:36,567
I don't think Mr. Vanelli
would appreciate his case being

833
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:39,667
jeopardized by foolish
counsel that was steering

834
01:03:39,767 --> 01:03:41,000
him in the wrong direction.

835
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:53,633
I appreciate your
advice, Mr. Mayor.

836
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:56,233
But I can assure you
that I won't get stuck

837
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,100
in traffic like Frank did.

838
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:11,633
Is he going be all right?

839
01:04:11,733 --> 01:04:13,900
Well, he ain't going
to be fucking his wife

840
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,333
for a while, that's for sure.

841
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:16,800
Well, he's lucky
he only got kicked.

842
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,900
Word in here is
that Clarence was

843
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,567
heavily into guns and crack.

844
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:20,900
Tell me about it.

845
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,267
That chippy who shot herself
was wired out of her skull.

846
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:25,300
It was only a matter of time.

847
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,900
Besides, Evelyn told me
something about some file.

848
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
She's going to check it out.

849
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,067
She'll let us know tomorrow.

850
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,467
What files?

851
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,833
I don't know, something
she found at Frank's house.

852
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:36,500
Anything to do
with that PINA thing?

853
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,967
Yeah, have you
figured that out yet?

854
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:38,900
I don't know.

855
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,800
It's somebody's name.

856
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,333
Penelope?

857
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:43,700
Penelope's with an E. This
thing is really getting weird.

858
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,633
I got two murders, two bullets.

859
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:48,033
I got two bodies.

860
01:04:48,133 --> 01:04:52,033
And then this PINA
thing in cough syrup.

861
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:54,933
Two shots, one of them
smashed into the skull

862
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:56,100
and the other one in the gut.

863
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,600
It's a total beauty.

864
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,433
Beautiful, but no fucking
gun to match it with unless you

865
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:00,533
luck out with SID.

866
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,133
I won't know about
that till late tomorrow.

867
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:04,767
100 guns, it takes a long
time to check it out.

868
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:05,900
As it is, I had a bribe.

869
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,933
Bribe?

870
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:08,267
Hey, don't worry about it.

871
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:09,933
It's only fixing a couple
of parking tickets.

872
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:12,100
I am worried about it, Bobby.

873
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,833
Hey, look, you're in a lot
of trouble here, pal, OK?

874
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,100
I'm just trying to help you out.

875
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,967
One shot in the head and the
other one in the stomach,

876
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:22,167
I can't figure it out.

877
01:05:22,267 --> 01:05:25,567
Even the chic shot
herself in the head.

878
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:26,767
Tyrone.

879
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:27,767
What about him?

880
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:28,900
He had two leads in him too.

881
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,200
Yeah.

882
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,633
The only guy that didn't
have two leads in him

883
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:33,433
is that fucker, Anderson.

884
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:34,800
Anderson?

885
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,433
Yeah, Clarence's buddy, the
guy with the guns in the crate?

886
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:38,733
Anderson.

887
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,767
Anderson, why does that name
sound so fucking familiar?

888
01:06:00,533 --> 01:06:03,833
About six liters of hydrate
and another gram of sodium,

889
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:04,967
and it will be ready.

890
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:07,267
You see, it's a
special solution that

891
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:10,333
stops the bullet without
destroying the rifling works.

892
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,400
It's kind of like
Jell-O. Can you

893
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,700
put this in the fridge for me?

894
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,933
Yeah.

895
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:17,067
And what time do you
want me to give you

896
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:18,867
a call tomorrow [inaudible]?

897
01:06:18,967 --> 01:06:20,267
Late.

898
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:22,367
I've I'm working on this
solution for about 10 years.

899
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:24,667
It's the only one
like it in the world.

900
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:29,500
I've been shooting this
thing 43 times on this case.

901
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,333
OK.

902
01:06:30,433 --> 01:06:33,067
OK, Aaron, there's the ticket.

903
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:34,000
Great, thanks.

904
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,333
I'll tell him.
Thanks.

905
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:36,267
Great.

906
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:40,533
Oh, my new assistant.

907
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:41,733
I've been going through
them like crazy.

908
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:52,800
Hey, Bernie, what's up?

909
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,800
How are you
doing there, Bobby?

910
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,200
OK.

911
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,367
Everything's for sale.

912
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:28,267
Hey, say there, you got
a nickle for the juke box?

913
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:31,967
The jukebox here
takes dollar bills.

914
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:36,133
Boy, have I got a
song to sing for you.

915
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:37,400
Let me see that ticket.

916
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:44,033
Oh, the guy who got this ticket
travels in some mighty high

917
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:45,367
social circles.

918
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:48,567
Guess who's address this is?

919
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:49,867
Try me.

920
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:54,767
3656 Sunswept Drive,
the humble abode

921
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:58,167
of one honorable
Franklin Crenshaw.

922
01:07:58,267 --> 01:08:00,333
The mayor, you're kidding?

923
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:03,233
Do I look like I'm kidding?

924
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:06,800
So did you talk to your brother?

925
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,867
Yeah, I told him you were
going to be early tomorrow.

926
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:11,267
But forget about that.

927
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,033
What about the stuff you
picked up at Frank's house?

928
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,000
I don't want to talk
about that until I'm sure.

929
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,000
Don't you trust me?

930
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,500
Well, of course I trust you.

931
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,167
Do you trust me?

932
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:23,367
Can I have
another one, please?

933
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:27,333
Another Virgin pina
colada coming right up.

934
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:31,300
So what about
the guy you chased?

935
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,500
Anderson, Philip Anderson.

936
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,333
You know him?

937
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:40,100
Philip Anderson,
wait just a minute.

938
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,400
Wait just a minute.

939
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:48,833
That's him.

940
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:50,767
It's Tyrone's crack dealer.

941
01:08:50,867 --> 01:08:53,100
He was the one that was with
the mayor's son the night

942
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,467
your brother and
Turner lost him.

943
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:00,300
Are you still going to
have a drink before dinner?

944
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,033
Yeah.

945
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:02,567
What do you have?

946
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:04,600
For the next couple of hours,
we have two tropical drinks

947
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,833
for the price of one.

948
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,933
I'll just have
a cup of coffee.

949
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:09,967
Oh, do you have espresso?

950
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,133
No, no way.

951
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:13,867
OK, I'll just have
a plain cup of coffee.

952
01:09:13,967 --> 01:09:17,633
Oh, and could you bring that
with cream and sugar, please?

953
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:18,900
Uh-huh.

954
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,400
I'll take one of those.

955
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,167
No, no.

956
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:23,333
You get two of those.

957
01:09:23,433 --> 01:09:25,367
Yeah, but I just want one.

958
01:09:25,467 --> 01:09:27,167
For the next couple
hours, you get two

959
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:28,533
drinks for the price of one.

960
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:29,567
OK, OK.

961
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,367
I'll take two, but
I'll just drink one.

962
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:35,000
OK.

963
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:47,033
God, it's impossible to
quit drinking nowadays.

964
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:49,800
Well, it's more
difficult for some people.

965
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,733
What do you mean by that?

966
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:51,633
Nothing.

967
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,767
OK, now where were we?

968
01:09:56,867 --> 01:09:57,933
The rooftop.

969
01:09:58,033 --> 01:09:59,533
The rooftop.

970
01:09:59,633 --> 01:10:02,333
According to Frank's records,
your brother and Turner were

971
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:04,367
chasing the mayor's
son across some rooftop

972
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,000
and out of the [inaudible].

973
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,400
Write Right.

974
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,400
Well, apparently, there
was someone else there too.

975
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,600
Yeah, Turner.

976
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,133
No, besides Turner.

977
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:14,367
Well, what do you mean?

978
01:10:14,467 --> 01:10:15,567
Look, your brother's
whole defense

979
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:16,867
is that he didn't
catch the mayor's

980
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:18,200
son the night of the murder.

981
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,533
And if he didn't
catch the mayor's son,

982
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,200
he certainly didn't
shoot him at close range

983
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,800
like the coroner's report said,
especially with two shots,

984
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,333
right?

985
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:29,167
I'm telling you, if turner
didn't have a convenient attack

986
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,900
of his vertigo, he would
have been a solid eye

987
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,900
witness for my brother.

988
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
He's still having a
tough time facing Tom.

989
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,367
He won't even do a visit.

990
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:40,900
He's got this big guilt
trip over the whole thing.

991
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,167
OK, so there you have it.

992
01:10:43,267 --> 01:10:46,200
So if you buy your brother's
story that he never caught up

993
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,967
with the mayor's son,
then it stands to reason

994
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,333
that somebody else shot him.

995
01:10:50,433 --> 01:10:52,567
Now, I'm telling you,
I think that somebody

996
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,233
else was that Anderson kid.

997
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:58,267
He was out there waiting
for him, and he shot him.

998
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:01,567
Yeah, but you're missing
two important points here.

999
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:03,367
Number one, there's motive.

1000
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:07,767
And number two, the bullet
from Tyrone's stomach

1001
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:11,367
was a perfect rifling
match to my brother's gun.

1002
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,133
First motive.

1003
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:14,900
I want you to
listen to something.

1004
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,433
From counsel for the defense,
people versus Thomas Anthony

1005
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:21,967
Vanelli, in consideration of
the actions and allocations

1006
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:23,767
inferring the sale of
narcotics and abuse

1007
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:29,167
thereof to Tyrone Crenshaw by
with and from Phillip Anderson.

1008
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,867
Counsel, hereby request the
presence of Phillip Anderson

1009
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:34,667
as witness and possible
implied suspect

1010
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:36,467
in the murder of
Tyrone Crenshaw,

1011
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:40,400
signed Frank Price,
date July 22.

1012
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,067
Where Where in the
hell did you get that?

1013
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,300
That's privileged information.

1014
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,300
But Frank was going to point the
finger at this kid, Anderson.

1015
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,400
Yeah.

1016
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,367
And whoever found out
pumped a few slugs

1017
01:11:51,467 --> 01:11:53,067
into him before he could talk.

1018
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:57,367
Not a few shots, two
exactly, two in Frank,

1019
01:11:57,467 --> 01:11:59,267
and two in that
Spanish nurse of his.

1020
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:01,767
Everything's in twos.

1021
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:04,200
I just talked to Tom about that.

1022
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,533
[pager ring]

1023
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:20,067
Where's the phone?

1024
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,233
It's right over there.

1025
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,833
So you want another drink?

1026
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:44,533
Is that two for
one special still on?

1027
01:12:44,633 --> 01:12:45,467
Uh-huh.

1028
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,433
Yeah, sure.

1029
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:48,333
I'll take two.

1030
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:01,167
There you go.

1031
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,633
I've got to go.

1032
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:18,933
My secretary just called.

1033
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:19,933
Well, what about dinner?

1034
01:13:20,033 --> 01:13:21,167
Well, I'm sorry.

1035
01:13:21,267 --> 01:13:22,567
We'll have to take a
rain check on that.

1036
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,933
What can be so important
this late at night.

1037
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,000
You tell me.

1038
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:40,733
There you go.

1039
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,433
I have something
for you, Mr. Vanelli.

1040
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,600
Have you got a light?

1041
01:14:57,767 --> 01:15:00,367
- How do you know my name?
- You don't remember?

1042
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,767
No, sorry.

1043
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:07,167
Should I?

1044
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:13,533
I work over at the Coco
Bowl I work around, you now?

1045
01:15:13,633 --> 01:15:15,800
Yeah, I remember now.

1046
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,800
You're the bitch
that smacked me.

1047
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,300
Say, wasn't your
hair brown then?

1048
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,567
A new wig.

1049
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:25,133
Please, don't be angry
with me Mr. Vanilli.

1050
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:27,367
I'm very sorry.

1051
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:30,233
Besides, I want to
make it up to you.

1052
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,633
Yeah.

1053
01:15:31,733 --> 01:15:34,433
How do you want to make it up
to me, by biting off my dick?

1054
01:15:34,533 --> 01:15:36,267
If you want me to.

1055
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:38,067
I'm rather fond of it.

1056
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,600
All right, so what do you want?

1057
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,067
A trade.

1058
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:42,433
A trade?

1059
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:43,567
Yes.

1060
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,533
I've got something you want.

1061
01:15:45,633 --> 01:15:49,533
And the county jail has
got something that I want,

1062
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:50,567
my little Roger.

1063
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:51,467
What?

1064
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:52,833
That little purse thief?

1065
01:15:52,933 --> 01:15:56,500
Look, honey, I'm not in the
market for what you're selling.

1066
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,633
And besides, soliciting
is against the law,

1067
01:15:59,733 --> 01:16:00,967
or don't you know that?

1068
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:05,433
Oh, Mr. Vanelli,
you've got it all wrong.

1069
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:07,433
You see, it's not
me that I'm selling.

1070
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:11,300
It's this.

1071
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,700
Where in the hell
did you get that?

1072
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,833
I think it will
help your brother.

1073
01:16:18,933 --> 01:16:22,000
It's the gun that
killed Wang Da Chow.

1074
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,500
Do we have a deal?

1075
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:33,700
[knocking]

1076
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,700
Oh, Jesus.

1077
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,700
What?

1078
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,100
It's me.
Open up.

1079
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,467
I got to talk to you.

1080
01:16:38,567 --> 01:16:39,333
I am busy.

1081
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:41,400
Just come on.
Open the door.

1082
01:16:46,867 --> 01:16:47,833
Come on, open up.

1083
01:16:47,933 --> 01:16:48,767
I got to talk to you.

1084
01:16:48,867 --> 01:16:50,467
It's important.

1085
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:51,433
I was coming.

1086
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:02,300
This better be good.

1087
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,667
Hey, Turner, you got a rag?

1088
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:05,867
A what?

1089
01:17:05,967 --> 01:17:07,133
A rag.

1090
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:08,267
Hey, throw me the rag.

1091
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,833
I sure hope you know
what the fuck you're doing.

1092
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:14,133
Don't worry your
pretty little face.

1093
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:16,000
Just toss me that rag.

1094
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,200
This is exactly how
they do it at SID,

1095
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,433
only they got a bigger budget.

1096
01:17:20,533 --> 01:17:23,733
All right, so where did
the broad get the gun?

1097
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,100
It was a job.

1098
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,567
Her boyfriend was paid $50
to pick up in the alley

1099
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:28,633
off Curtis Street.

1100
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:29,900
Wait, Curtis Street.

1101
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Now, isn't that the
import/export warehouse

1102
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,000
where we found Wang Da Chow?

1103
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,200
Sometimes your
memory amazes me.

1104
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,367
And guess you paid him the $50?

1105
01:17:37,467 --> 01:17:38,567
Haven't a clue.

1106
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:42,233
Anderson The late Phillip
Anderson, gun collector

1107
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:45,200
extraordinaire,
Clarence's partner,

1108
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,867
supplier of dangerous narcotics
to Mayor Crenshaw's son.

1109
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:48,900
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

1110
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,133
Now I don't get it.

1111
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:51,733
What about the gun
we found on Clarence?

1112
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,100
Are you ready for this?

1113
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,533
It's so fucking brilliant,
you won't believe it.

1114
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:56,667
Well, probably not.

1115
01:17:56,767 --> 01:17:58,233
But try me anyway.

1116
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,467
Hey, you got any vice grips?

1117
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:02,433
Do you have any idea
how fucking late it is?

1118
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:05,400
Yeah, you weren't
sleeping anyway.

1119
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,333
My point exactly.

1120
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:14,167
You know, we keep
catching these fuckers,

1121
01:18:14,267 --> 01:18:19,367
like Clarence, you find
the weapon on them.

1122
01:18:19,467 --> 01:18:28,433
well, you know he
just shot somebody,

1123
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:32,900
and we match the rifling of
the bullets with the gun,

1124
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,667
but they don't match.

1125
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:36,467
Thanks.

1126
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:38,767
But we overlooked two
very important things.

1127
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:39,733
Now, remember that word two.

1128
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,033
Two.

1129
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,133
I'm going over everything
in my head, right?

1130
01:18:43,233 --> 01:18:46,700
Two bodies, two bullets, right?

1131
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,733
And then it hits me, two guns.

1132
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:52,133
Two guns?

1133
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:55,833
Yeah, two guns,
and two bullets,

1134
01:18:55,933 --> 01:18:58,567
but only one good bullet.

1135
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,967
OK, now I don't get it.

1136
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:01,433
What do you mean
by one good bullet?

1137
01:19:01,533 --> 01:19:05,633
Just give me a second and
I'll explain ti all to you.

1138
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:09,033
But first, we need a control.

1139
01:19:09,133 --> 01:19:10,267
A control?

1140
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:12,467
Yeah, you know, a control.

1141
01:19:12,567 --> 01:19:14,200
Didn't you take
science in high school?

1142
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:14,933
No, no.

1143
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:16,267
I hated science.

1144
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:19,000
You need a gun, and we'll
use it as a control.

1145
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,733
Wait, my gun?

1146
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:21,633
What about your gun?

1147
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:23,900
My gun's in the house.

1148
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,267
Now, my gun's in my house.

1149
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:27,100
Do you want to stay here
for two more fucking hours

1150
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,400
while I go home and get
my gun and come back here?

1151
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,567
Great.

1152
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:32,800
Now I got to wake up Donna.

1153
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:38,533
Clarence, he had
two guns, right?

1154
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:42,300
He takes the bullet from one
gun any an x into the lead.

1155
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,133
Now, what does that do, right?

1156
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:47,333
When the bullet hits the
body, it breaks apart, right?

1157
01:19:47,433 --> 01:19:48,933
It's totally untraceable,
OK, especially

1158
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:54,800
in close range at the head, on a
shoulder blade, in a bone area,

1159
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:55,700
right?

1160
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,667
So it breaks apart.

1161
01:19:56,767 --> 01:19:58,067
It's completely untraceable.

1162
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,867
There is no way you are
ever going to get a rifling

1163
01:20:00,967 --> 01:20:02,900
match on a bullet of that time.

1164
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,933
So there, OK.

1165
01:20:04,033 --> 01:20:06,467
What does good, old Clarence do?

1166
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:10,067
He takes the other gun, and
he leans over the already dead

1167
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:13,267
body, and he pumps a
bullet into fleshy area,

1168
01:20:13,367 --> 01:20:16,533
let's say the
stomach, for instance.

1169
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:20,633
So then he turns around, and he
runs, and he runs, and he runs,

1170
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,067
and he runs down the block.

1171
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:24,933
He runs around the corner,
he runs down the alley,

1172
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:28,233
and he takes the fresh
gun, and he tosses it

1173
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:30,533
in a pre-determined stash spot.

1174
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:33,100
It throws the fresh gun
away and he purposely

1175
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,867
hangs on to the other gun.

1176
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:37,133
Bing, bang, we catch him, right?

1177
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:40,233
And we're as happy
as little Boy Scouts.

1178
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,167
We take the weapon down to SID.

1179
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:46,233
The rifling doesn't match,
case dismissed, no evidence.

1180
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:50,133
Meanwhile, Blondie's
boyfriend comes by later

1181
01:20:50,233 --> 01:20:52,200
and he picks the gun
out of the dumpster.

1182
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,333
Now we got to take
the rifling here

1183
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:57,900
and match it with the pictures.

1184
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,633
And we have to
do this tonight?

1185
01:20:59,733 --> 01:21:01,667
Yeah, tonight.

1186
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:04,067
Wait a minute, now you're
not going to fire guns

1187
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,733
right now, right, tonight?

1188
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:06,867
Someone's going
to call the cops.

1189
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:07,767
We are the cops.

1190
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:10,100
[gunshots]

1191
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:21,800
Excuse me, isr.

1192
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,967
What is it?

1193
01:21:23,067 --> 01:21:24,367
There's an Evelyn
Curtz to see you.

1194
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:27,033
Evelyn Curtz, oh, sen her in.

1195
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:44,967
Bobby, if you put
a hole in my pool,

1196
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:45,967
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1197
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,500
Hey, chill out.

1198
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,567
Why do you think I took half
the powder out of the bullets?

1199
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:50,967
What the hell are
you doing out here?

1200
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:52,633
Are you coming in or what?
- Hey, I got it.

1201
01:21:57,733 --> 01:21:59,033
You fucking idiot.

1202
01:21:59,133 --> 01:22:00,500
Hey, would you mind
getting the bullets

1203
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,467
while you're down there?

1204
01:22:07,067 --> 01:22:08,067
You stupid jerk.

1205
01:22:37,467 --> 01:22:39,200
[phone ringing]

1206
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,200
BOBBY [recorded voice]::
Hi, this is Bobby.

1207
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,633
I'm not at home right now.

1208
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:46,067
But if you leave a
message after the beep,

1209
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:50,233
your call will be returned
as soon as possible.

1210
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:02,167
[tv on in background]

1211
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,167
[gunshots]

1212
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:43,467
I'm going to tell
you one more time.

1213
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:46,367
Don't ever touch the
body until I arrive.

1214
01:28:46,467 --> 01:28:48,033
I don't care if you
are wearing gloves.

1215
01:28:48,133 --> 01:28:50,000
Where the hell did you
get those things anyway?

1216
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,500
Well, I got hem
at the gas station.

1217
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,633
They give them out now so you
don't get gas on your hands,

1218
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:54,767
the self-serve pump?

1219
01:28:54,867 --> 01:28:57,100
Does this look
like a gas station?

1220
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,600
This is the scene of a
crime for crying out loud.

1221
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:01,600
Excuse me.

1222
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,500
How long are you going to be?

1223
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,633
I'm sorry.

1224
01:29:03,733 --> 01:29:04,967
This is going to probably
be an all nighter.

1225
01:29:05,067 --> 01:29:06,133
I got measurement to take.

1226
01:29:06,233 --> 01:29:07,767
I got fingerprints.

1227
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:09,833
Besides, this is a cop.

1228
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:11,733
I got to do this
one by the book.

1229
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:15,000
If you can find a place
to stay for a couple days,

1230
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,900
it would be a big help.

1231
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,533
I got to do this
one by the book.

1232
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:19,333
Come on.

1233
01:29:19,433 --> 01:29:20,767
I'm taking you to the motel.

1234
01:29:20,867 --> 01:29:22,300
- Well, wait a minute.
- Yeah, come on.

1235
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,367
Come on.

1236
01:29:23,467 --> 01:29:24,367
You're going there,
and you're not going

1237
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:25,067
to tell anybody where you are.

1238
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:27,433
[inaudible]

1239
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,900
So I went to the mayor's house.

1240
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,267
I thought it was the
only fair thing to do.

1241
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:43,667
After all, we do work together.

1242
01:29:43,767 --> 01:29:46,367
We're still professionals.

1243
01:29:46,467 --> 01:29:48,967
Yeah, Lieutenant Parker
was a professional.

1244
01:29:49,067 --> 01:29:52,233
We're rank amateurs
compared to him.

1245
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,833
And you of all
people should know

1246
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:56,000
not to divulge any
information to a suspect

1247
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,933
until you have enough
proof to lock him up.

1248
01:29:58,033 --> 01:29:59,700
I have the proof.

1249
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,000
I got back the serial
numbers on all the guns

1250
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,833
that you found and
compared them to the ones

1251
01:30:03,933 --> 01:30:05,333
that your brother had found.

1252
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:08,100
Then I got the numbers of
Anderson's gun and also the one

1253
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,433
that you found on Clarance.

1254
01:30:09,533 --> 01:30:10,967
They were consecutive
numbers starting

1255
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:13,333
with the last issue of the
last handgun distributed

1256
01:30:13,433 --> 01:30:15,300
by the police department.

1257
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,000
See, that's why I was
late to Campbell's.

1258
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,000
My secretary finally
got a hold of the list.

1259
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,600
What did he do, sleep
with a girl to get it?

1260
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,133
Very funny.

1261
01:30:24,233 --> 01:30:27,033
The fact is, that according
to the manufacturer's records,

1262
01:30:27,133 --> 01:30:30,400
the LAPD purchased
5,000 more guns

1263
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,633
than were listed on
the LAPD records.

1264
01:30:34,733 --> 01:30:39,400
And guess whose name was
signed on the purchase order?

1265
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,933
Mayor Crenshaw's.

1266
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:42,467
You guessed it.

1267
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:44,800
And you figured this
out all by yourself?

1268
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,700
Don't patronize me.

1269
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,000
In reality, your
brother is the one

1270
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,667
that deserves all the credit.

1271
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:50,967
I get it.

1272
01:30:51,067 --> 01:30:52,800
That's the information
that the Mayor's son was

1273
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,033
using to blackmail his father.

1274
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:56,833
He was skimming
guns off the top.

1275
01:30:56,933 --> 01:30:59,000
Yeah, and was going to turn
him in if he didn't give money

1276
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,633
to support his drug habit.

1277
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:01,533
Which he didn't.

1278
01:31:01,633 --> 01:31:02,900
Exactly.

1279
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,967
And when the word got back to
the guys buying the weapons,

1280
01:31:06,067 --> 01:31:07,267
he was offed.

1281
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:09,533
They paid somebody to
shoot the Mayor's kid.

1282
01:31:09,633 --> 01:31:10,933
Yeah.

1283
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:12,300
And then they set
it up to make it look

1284
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,667
like your brother did it.

1285
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:16,467
See, then they killed
two birds with one stone.

1286
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:18,200
They figured that your
brother was getting just

1287
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,467
a little bit too close, and they
wanted him out of the picture

1288
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:21,367
too.

1289
01:31:24,867 --> 01:31:29,067
Hey, you haven't told me
about that pool thing yet.

1290
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:30,167
The pool?
You

1291
01:31:30,267 --> 01:31:31,500
This two gun theory.

1292
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,667
That's why you came
to my house, remember,

1293
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:37,000
this brilliant two-gun thing
you just had to tell me about?

1294
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,067
Yeah, yeah, OK.

1295
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:39,300
I'll tell you in the morning.

1296
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,633
You just get some
sleep now, all right?

1297
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:33,733
The next stop on your list,
[inaudible] a little Wang Da

1298
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:36,200
Chow was skimming off the top.

1299
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,833
You know, Bobby, I
had a hard time getting

1300
01:32:39,933 --> 01:32:41,400
back to bed after you left.

1301
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,533
That's too bad,
because I figured

1302
01:32:43,633 --> 01:32:46,300
you and Donna were good for
at least two more rounds.

1303
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,033
But then again, I forgot
about that kick in the nuts

1304
01:32:49,133 --> 01:32:50,833
you took from
Clarence last night.

1305
01:32:50,933 --> 01:32:52,133
Oh, come on, Bobby.

1306
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,267
He was a fucking scumbag
and everybody knew it.

1307
01:32:54,367 --> 01:32:56,167
So you blew him away.

1308
01:32:56,267 --> 01:32:57,667
One less scumbag.

1309
01:32:57,767 --> 01:33:00,800
What are you trying to do,
clean up the city, pal?

1310
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,267
Maybe it was something he said
to you in interrogation room

1311
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:05,333
when I left you
two alone that day.

1312
01:33:05,433 --> 01:33:08,300
Maybe I should have stayed
around for the strong arm.

1313
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,600
Look, you don't understand.

1314
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,767
They wanted me to kill
your brother, all right?

1315
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:12,800
I talked them out of that.

1316
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,800
They just wanted
me to shoot him.

1317
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,867
Who's they, Turner?

1318
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:20,033
Mayor Crenshaw.

1319
01:33:20,133 --> 01:33:22,300
Are you just another
pawn like him?

1320
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,167
You fucking make me sick.

1321
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:27,967
You shoot the Mayor's
son, and then you set

1322
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:28,933
up my brother for the Patsy.

1323
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:29,833
Look.

1324
01:33:29,933 --> 01:33:30,833
I didn't want to do it.

1325
01:33:30,933 --> 01:33:32,467
But I didn't have any choice.

1326
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:34,000
I was into them for
some big money, Bobby.

1327
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,267
They were going to kill me.

1328
01:33:35,367 --> 01:33:37,867
You really had me
going there for a while.

1329
01:33:37,967 --> 01:33:39,333
There was one thing
I couldn't figure

1330
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:43,100
out, how you got the gun.

1331
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,967
Now , faking your
fear of heights,

1332
01:33:45,067 --> 01:33:46,800
so you wouldn't have to
be an eyewitness alibi

1333
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,667
for my brother was one thing.

1334
01:33:48,767 --> 01:33:52,567
But getting a hold of his gun
and shooting the Mayor's son,

1335
01:33:52,667 --> 01:33:54,733
now that was a work of art.

1336
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:57,833
That's the one thing that
I just couldn't figure out.

1337
01:33:57,933 --> 01:33:59,967
But you fucked up.

1338
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:02,800
You let me get a little
too close to the help.

1339
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,233
It's amazing what
one small favor

1340
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:08,033
will do for the right person.

1341
01:34:08,133 --> 01:34:10,567
She, Blondie, she
gave me a blow by blow

1342
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:13,467
description of the night
my brother had with her.

1343
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:15,933
It was the same night
that he lost Tyrone

1344
01:34:16,033 --> 01:34:18,900
running across the rooftops.

1345
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,700
He's always been a
little on the weak side

1346
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,533
when it came to
women, especially

1347
01:34:22,633 --> 01:34:24,167
when they were for free.

1348
01:34:24,267 --> 01:34:26,633
While he was slipping
it to her, you

1349
01:34:26,733 --> 01:34:29,233
were running down the
alley with his gun

1350
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:33,467
and planting a fresh, clean
lead in the Mayor's son.

1351
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:37,500
Only he'd already been shot
with a nice x-style bullet

1352
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,467
from Anderson's gun.

1353
01:34:39,567 --> 01:34:41,100
What a way to go.

1354
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,067
Kill me once, but
shoot me twice.

1355
01:34:45,167 --> 01:34:46,633
Look, I didn't
want to do it, Bobby.

1356
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:49,500
But sometimes things just don't
turn out the way you plan them.

1357
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,300
I thought it was just
going to be a straight hit.

1358
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,700
I didn't know it was
going to be your brother.

1359
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,233
But see, he got too close, man.

1360
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:57,900
He got too close to the
fucking guns, Bobby.

1361
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,600
You remind me of
alcohol, Turner,

1362
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:03,433
always waiting around
just to fuck me up.

1363
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:08,833
It's still kind of cold to be
wearing that Hawaiian shirt,

1364
01:35:08,933 --> 01:35:10,333
isn't it, pal?

1365
01:35:10,433 --> 01:35:12,767
Just about as cold as it was
the night when you took out

1366
01:35:12,867 --> 01:35:14,733
Frank and his Mexican nurse.

1367
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:22,100
Who would have thought that PINA
pina was Spanish for pineapple?

1368
01:35:25,233 --> 01:35:30,067
I think that pretty much
points the finger at you, pal.

1369
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,833
So what's next?

1370
01:35:31,933 --> 01:35:33,533
You got my name on
one of those bullets

1371
01:35:33,633 --> 01:35:36,267
or do I have to shoot
somebody with one of yours.

1372
01:35:36,367 --> 01:35:38,533
If you think I'm going to
move in with my brother,

1373
01:35:38,633 --> 01:35:40,433
I got news for you, pal.

1374
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:43,367
I got that attorney
working on it.

1375
01:35:43,467 --> 01:35:47,300
And he's going to be walking
the streets tomorrow afternoon.

1376
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,533
Not Evelyn.

1377
01:35:48,633 --> 01:35:50,000
Yeah, that's right.

1378
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,733
She figured out the
gun scam before I did.

1379
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:56,200
But then again, she travels
in the same circles.

1380
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:59,100
We make a good team,
don't you think?

1381
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,133
Go ahead, make your move.

1382
01:36:01,233 --> 01:36:03,133
Try to split us up.

1383
01:36:03,233 --> 01:36:05,033
But you're going to have
to shoot me more than twice

1384
01:36:05,133 --> 01:36:07,033
before you can get to her.

1385
01:36:07,133 --> 01:36:08,867
I got to do it, Bobby.

1386
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:09,767
You leave me no choice.

1387
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,100
Go ahead, you dumb fuck.

1388
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,133
You haven't got the balls.

1389
01:36:16,233 --> 01:36:17,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1390
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,933
Let me just turn around so
you can shoot me in the back

1391
01:36:20,033 --> 01:36:22,467
like you did to Clarence.

1392
01:36:22,567 --> 01:36:25,800
Go ahead, pull the
trigger, motherfucker.

1393
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,267
Go ahead, you dumb--

1394
01:36:41,367 --> 01:36:43,633
I told you you'd have to
shoot me more than once.

1395
01:36:43,733 --> 01:36:46,133
But then again, you'd
have to use real bullets.

1396
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,167
I took the liberty of
filling your gun with blanks

1397
01:36:48,267 --> 01:36:50,133
when we were at the pool.

1398
01:36:50,233 --> 01:36:52,400
Look, you're not going
to take me in, Bobby.

1399
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,233
It's not going to be that easy.

1400
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:55,533
It's over, Turner.

1401
01:36:55,633 --> 01:36:58,400
Even the mayor is going
to fall on this one.

1402
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:02,467
Look, I'm going to turn
around, I'm going to walk away,

1403
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,400
and you're never
going to see me again.

1404
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,733
The only way you're going to
take me down is to kill me.

1405
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:07,833
And I know you too well, Bobby.

1406
01:37:07,933 --> 01:37:09,033
You don't have what it takes.

1407
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:11,500
And I suppose you do.

1408
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,467
Look, Bobby, I
was in a tight spot.

1409
01:37:14,567 --> 01:37:16,267
I didn't have any
place else to go but--

1410
01:37:49,967 --> 01:37:52,033
[gunshots]

1411
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:31,567
Two guns?
Two shots.

1412
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:02,000
I can't believe
that Tom is going

1413
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,467
to be released in
a couple of hours

1414
01:39:03,567 --> 01:39:07,033
and this whole ordeal
is finally over.

1415
01:39:07,133 --> 01:39:09,100
Finally, I'm glad about that.

1416
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,600
But I think it's good.

1417
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,900
It's good with few release
papers, that's bad.

1418
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,100
See that son of a bitch?

1419
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,533
He's still walking the street.

1420
01:39:16,633 --> 01:39:17,767
Bobby, Bobby, calm down.

1421
01:39:17,867 --> 01:39:18,900
And just stop it.

1422
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,867
There is nothing
you can do about it.

1423
01:39:20,967 --> 01:39:23,000
This is a system that
has to be followed.

1424
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,300
Fuck the system.

1425
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,067
Bobby?

1426
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:26,167
Bobby, come back.

1427
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:35,300
Crenshaw, you may
think you can lock people

1428
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,233
up and write your own rules.

1429
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:39,567
But the people aren't
going to take it.

1430
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,567
Who do you think
you are, you punk?

1431
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:47,500
You so much as look
at me the wrong way,

1432
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,167
and I'll have you
writing parking

1433
01:39:49,267 --> 01:39:52,367
tickets in a neighborhood
that doesn't know how to read.

1434
01:39:52,467 --> 01:39:55,067
There's a hammer behind
every bullet on this force,

1435
01:39:55,167 --> 01:39:59,167
and you looking at the
man who pays your salary.

1436
01:39:59,267 --> 01:40:02,000
Don't make my fingers
itch, Mr. Vanelli,

1437
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,000
or the next time you
see your brother's name,

1438
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,367
it will be carved in stone.

1439
01:40:50,067 --> 01:40:54,333
[music playing]
