1
00:00:56,884 --> 00:01:03,168
I knew Harvey Dent,
I was his friend.

2
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,248
and it was very long time before

3
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:10,855
someone inspires
us the way he did.

4
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:15,593
I believed in Harvey Dent.

5
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:37,992
- Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
- He wasn't alone.

6
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:42,388
- You don't get to bring friends.
- There are not my friends.

7
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:46,087
- Don't worry no charge for them.
- And why would I want them?

8
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:48,592
They were trying to up your price.

9
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,695
They work for the mercenary,
a masked man.

10
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,167
Bane?

11
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,166
Get them on board.
I'll call them in.

12
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,987
The flight plan
I just filed the agency,

13
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:12,526
list me, my man, Dr Pavel here

14
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:15,102
but only one of you.

15
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:22,950
The first one to talk get
to stay on my aircraft.

16
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,434
Who paid you
to grab Dr. Pavel?

17
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:42,743
I didn't fly so good,
who wants to try next?

18
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:48,171
Tell me about Bane!
Why does he wear a mask?

19
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,396
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

20
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:55,824
Or perhaps he was wondering
why someone would shoot a man

21
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,596
before throwing him out of the plane.

22
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:06,509
At least you can talk. Who are you?

23
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:09,423
It doesn't matter who we are.

24
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:12,553
What matters is our plan.

25
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,290
No one cared who I was
until I put on the mask.

26
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:27,493
- If I pulled that off, will you die?
- It will be extremely painful ...

27
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,292
- You're a big guy.
- ...For you.

28
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,392
Was getting caught part of your plan?

29
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,486
Of course.

30
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:46,281
Dr Pavel refused that offer
in favour of yours.

31
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,179
We had to find out what he told you.

32
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:51,002
Nothing! I said nothing!

33
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:06,756
Congratulations!
You got yourself caught!

34
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:07,614
Sir ...

35
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,500
Now what's the next step
of your master plan?

36
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,400
Crashing this plane ...

37
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,301
...with no survivors.

38
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,563
Mayday! Mayday!

39
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:52,632
No!

40
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,510
They expect one of us
in the wreck, brother.

41
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,807
- Did we started the fire?
- Yes. The fire rises.

42
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:14,600
Calm down, doctor.
Now this is not the time for fear.

43
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,240
That comes later.

44
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:47,357
Harvey Dent's day
may not be our oldest holiday

45
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,582
but we're here tonight because
it's one the most important.

46
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:54,788
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime.

47
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,253
It made Gotham a safer place than
it was at the time of his death,

48
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,159
eight years ago.

49
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:02,156
This city has seen a
historical turn around

50
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,742
No city is without
crime but this city is

51
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:06,866
without organized
crime because of

52
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:11,477
the Dent's act gave law enforcement
teeth in it's fight against the Mafia.

53
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,148
Now people are talking
about repealing the Dent's act

54
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:19,076
and to them I'll say not on my watch.

55
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,557
I want to thank Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

56
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:25,054
Now I'm told that Mr. Wayne
couldn't be here tonight,

57
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,919
but I'm sure that he's
with us in spirit.

58
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,789
and now, I'm going to give away
to an important voice ...

59
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,225
Who can lay eyes on Wayne these days?

60
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,281
No one has, not in years.

61
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:38,415
People put in faith in a murderous
thug in a mask and a cape.

62
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,948
A thug who shows his
true nature when

63
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:47,633
he betrayed the trust of this great
man and murdered him in cold blood.

64
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,376
Sweetheart, what's so
fast with the chow?

65
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,181
Shrimp balls?

66
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:53,684
Jim Gordon can tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

67
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:54,286
Thank you.

68
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:57,902
Let him tell you himself.
Commissioner Gordon!

69
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,586
The truth ...

70
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:22,807
I have... a speech telling
the truth about Harvey Dent.

71
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,761
Maybe the time isn't right.

72
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,327
Maybe right now...

73
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,517
All you need to know is that ...

74
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,895
there are one thousand
inmates in Blackgate Prison

75
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,138
as a direct result of the Dent's act.

76
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:48,123
These are violent criminals essential
thugs in the organized crime machine.

77
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:53,637
Maybe, for now I should say about the
death of Harvey Dent's is this...

78
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:00,211
It has not been for nothing.

79
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:02,496
Did you see the guy
who owns the house?

80
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:04,791
No. I heard he never
leaves the east wing.

81
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:08,533
You know, I heard he had an accident.
Yeah that he's disfigured ...

82
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,588
Mr. Till! Why are your people
using the main staircase?

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,467
- And where is Mrs. Bolton?
- She's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

84
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:21,232
Get to the east wing.

85
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:23,655
Unlock door, put the
tray on the table,

86
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,099
and lock the door again.

87
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:26,396
Nothing more.

88
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:33,138
I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I tried
but he won't see you.

89
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,296
You know, you mustn't
take it personally.

90
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,094
Everyone knows that Wayne
is hold up in there with

91
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:41,100
8 inch nails paving into mason's jar

92
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,609
It's very good of you
to let me off the ground.

93
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,750
Why are you wasting your
time trying to talk

94
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,401
to a man who throw
away your investment

95
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:04,186
on some save the world vanity project?

96
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,775
He can't get your
money back, I can.

97
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:10,192
I could try explaining that
the save the world project,

98
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:14,125
vain or not, is worth investing in,
Mr. Daggett.

99
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,652
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys.

100
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:21,178
So why waste my time, indeed?

101
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,855
Second report shift report's in,

102
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:25,485
You should spend some
time with the mayor.

103
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:27,195
Well that's your department.

104
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,628
Did anyone shows him
the crime stats?

105
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,795
He goes by his guts,

106
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,101
and it continue to bothers him
no matter what the numbers.

107
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,602
Must be popular with his wife.

108
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,213
Not really. He took the kids
and left for Cleveland.

109
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,921
We have plenty of time for visits.

110
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,216
The Mayor going to dump
him in the spring.

111
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,411
Really? But he's a hero.

112
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,105
War hero. This is peace time.

113
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,231
Sorry sorry.

114
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:22,168
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne!

115
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,844
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

116
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:33,031
Although you don't have
long nails or facial scars sir...

117
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:36,285
That's what they say about me?

118
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:39,673
Because you know,
no one ever sees you.

119
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,204
That's a beautiful necklace!

120
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:43,746
Reminds me of one that
belongs to my mother.

121
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:46,480
It can't be the same one,

122
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:51,025
because her Pearls are in the safe.

123
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:58,865
The manufacturer clearly
explained that it is uncrackable.

124
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,643
Nobody told me
it was uncrackable.

125
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:13,125
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

126
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:15,493
Look you wouldn't
beat up a woman,

127
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:17,856
anymore than I would
beat up a cripple.

128
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,997
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

129
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,543
Good night, Mr. Wayne!

130
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,187
- Can I have a ride?
- You read my mind!

131
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,230
Let's go!

132
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,566
Ms. Tate was asking to see you again.

133
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:55,869
- She's very persistent.
- And quite lovely.

134
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:58,099
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

135
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,943
- What are you doing?
- Examining print dust.

136
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,716
We've been robbed.

137
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:05,960
And this your idea of a..
sounding the alarm, is it?

138
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,174
She took pearls,
tracking device and all.

139
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:09,782
- She?
- One of the maids.

140
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,787
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this part of the house.

141
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,326
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

142
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:21,503
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't. She does.

143
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:27,361
Sir! Congressman Gilly's
wife been calling

144
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:30,043
in apparently the
congressman never made

145
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,304
it home after the Wayne
Foundation event.

146
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,310
That's the job for the police.

147
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:37,028
When you and Dent clean up the
streets, you've cleaned them good.

148
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:42,171
Pretty soon we will be chasing
down an over due library books.

149
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:48,269
and yet, here you're act
like we're still at war.

150
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,087
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

151
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:54,885
You have something you
want to ask me officer Blake?

152
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,794
It's about that night, this night,
eight years ago, the night Dent died.

153
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,302
The last confirm sighting
of The Batman.

154
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,059
Who murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams,

155
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:08,388
brakes Dent's neck
and then just vanishes.

156
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,943
I'm not hearing the question.

157
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,517
Don't you want to know who he was?

158
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,995
I know exactly who he was.

159
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,021
He was The Batman.

160
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:25,601
Let's go see about
The Congressman's wife.

161
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:36,108
Master Wayne!

162
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,749
Master Wayne!

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,170
You haven't been down
here in a long time.

164
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:14,854
I'm trying to finding more
about our jewel thief.

165
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:16,309
I ran her prints.

166
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,347
Unless she loss a lot of weight,

167
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,794
she was wearing someone
else's fingerprints.

168
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,062
She's good.

169
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,389
She may be, but we
a..trace on the necklace.

170
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:29,368
We do, so I cross reference
the address she went back to,

171
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,290
with police data on high
end thieves and these

172
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:35,375
and Selina Kyle.

173
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:40,857
Her database’s are full of close
calls and tips around the fences.

174
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:44,769
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

175
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,540
We should send the police
before she fences her purposes.

176
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,068
She won't. She likes it too much
and they weren't what she was after.

177
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,245
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

178
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:57,470
I was printer toner mixed with
graphite on the safe.

179
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,173
It gives you good pull
and and it's untraceable.

180
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,115
Fascinating! You two should
exchanging notes over coffee.

181
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,193
So you're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

182
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,348
At this point, I'd set you
up with a chimpanzee,

183
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:10,152
if it'd bring you back to the world.

184
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,287
- There's nothing out there for me.
- And that's the problem.

185
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:17,036
You hung up your cape and your
mask but you didn't move on.

186
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,775
You never went to find a life,
you'll find some how...

187
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,848
Alfred ...

188
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,985
I did find someone.

189
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,552
I know, and you lost them
but that's all part of living sir.

190
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,170
But you're not living,
you're just waiting,

191
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,947
hoping things to go bad again.

192
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,477
Remember when you left Gotham?

193
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,444
Before all this,
before Batman,

194
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:38,488
You've been gone for seven years.

195
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,199
Seven years I've waited
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

196
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:45,608
Every year, I took a holiday.

197
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,319
I went to Florence's cafe
on the banks of the Arno.

198
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,296
Every fine evening, I'll sit there
and ordered a Fernet Branca.

199
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,342
I had this fantasy..

200
00:16:56,886 --> 00:17:02,354
that I would look across the
tables ... and I'll see you there ...

201
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,872
...With a wife maybe
a couple of kids.

202
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:12,483
You won't say anything
to me, nor me to you.

203
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:19,482
But we both know that you made it,
that you were happy.

204
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:26,622
I never wanted you to
come back to Gotham.

205
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,068
I always know that
there was nothing

206
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:31,619
else here for you except
pain and tragedy

207
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:35,819
and I wanted something
more for you than that.

208
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,912
I still do.

209
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:47,815
It washed up here a
couples of times a month

210
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,614
even more when it gets colder.

211
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,608
Homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

212
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:57,703
We pulled him from the base but
other than that, we didn't touch it.

213
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:00,960
What?

214
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:03,082
His name is Jimmy.
He's from St. Swithin's.

215
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,528
He's the boy on my school.
I coached the ball.

216
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,082
Jimmy has not been around for months.

217
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,287
- No, why?
- Blake, you know why.

218
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:15,895
He aged out.

219
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,802
We don't have the resources
to keep the boys on after 16.

220
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,102
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for them.

221
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,902
Not for the past couple of years.

222
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:27,402
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

223
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:30,301
I'd like to. If that's alright.

224
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,702
You know what he was
doing down there in the tunnels?

225
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:37,201
A lot of guys go in down in the
tunnels when they aged out.

226
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:44,294
They said he lived down there.
They says there's work down there.

227
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:45,998
Work?

228
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:48,804
What kind of work you
can find in the sewers?

229
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:52,303
More than you can
find out here I guess.

230
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:55,288
- So you know about him.
- Of course.

231
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:59,685
Do you think he's coming back?

232
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,378
I don't know...

233
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,595
You brought a date?

234
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:21,297
I like someone around
to open doors for me.

235
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:25,206
Right hand, I got partials.

236
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:31,403
Very nice!

237
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:36,801
Not so fast, handsome!
You've got something for me?

238
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,201
Oh yes.

239
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:51,316
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints,

240
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,217
but I'm guessing, you need his thumb.

241
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:59,114
- You don't count so good huh?
- I count fine.

242
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:02,913
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

243
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,919
Okay ...

244
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:13,072
My friend's outside, just... hit send.

245
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,990
- This place is a little dim.
- I'll light up in a minute. Trust me.

246
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:31,879
Is everything okay?

247
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:34,271
Great. Catch you later.

248
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:45,567
It would've been a lot easier to
just give me what we agreed.

249
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,574
We can't have loose ends.

250
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:52,277
and even in that dress,
no one going to miss you.

251
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:55,781
No but my friend over there,

252
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:59,172
Every cop in the city is missing him.

253
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:03,624
That's cute! But they're not going
to be looking in a place like this.

254
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:08,165
I don't know,
you did use your cell phone.

255
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,634
Police! Get down now!

256
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:43,045
Help me!

257
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:55,217
Keep some pressure
on that, sweetheart.

258
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,328
Call me?

259
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:04,990
- Careful, Miss.
- He's bleeding! You gotta help him!

260
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:11,084
I've got The Congressman.

261
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:41,498
There!

262
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:49,484
The manhole! Get this out.
Get the GWPD down here!

263
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:51,944
You three, down with me!

264
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:55,899
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

265
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:14,183
What? He went down there?

266
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,819
- We're going down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

267
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:49,329
What gas? It's a sewer.

268
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:51,481
No one goes in there until
we know what's down there.

269
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,426
We know who's there sir,
a police commissioner.

270
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:55,477
Someone get this hot head out of here.

271
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,776
and where's that GWP guy?

272
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:43,014
Why are you here?

273
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:46,368
Answer him!

274
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:49,856
I was asking you.

275
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,648
It's a Police Commissioner.

276
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:59,679
- And you brought him down here?
- We didn't know what to do.

277
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:01,451
- We just thought ...
- You panicked.

278
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,449
And your weakness cost
the lives of three others.

279
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:07,070
No. He's a little ...

280
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:13,630
Search him. Then I'll kill you.

281
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,519
He's dead!

282
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,409
So show me his body!

283
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,699
The water runs to any
one of the out flows.

284
00:25:47,824 --> 00:25:49,786
We'll never find him.

285
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:58,229
- Follow him.
- Follow him?

286
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,911
Detective! Detective! Hey!

287
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:17,548
You awake?

288
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:24,603
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

289
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:27,304
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't
take unscheduled calls,

290
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,504
even from a police officer.

291
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:33,104
If I go get a warrant for the
investigation of Harvey Dent's murder,

292
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:35,904
it still counts as an unscheduled?

293
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,226
How can I do for you officer?

294
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:45,080
Commissioner Gordon been shot.

295
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,756
He chased a gun man down in the sewers.

296
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:52,209
When I pulled him out, he was
babbling about an underground army,

297
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,969
a masked man called Bane.

298
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,272
Shouldn't you be telling this to
your superiors officers about this?

299
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,913
They asked if he saw
any giant alligators.

300
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:03,703
He needs you.

301
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,790
He needs The Batman.

302
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:08,948
Commissioner Gordon thinks ...

303
00:27:08,949 --> 00:27:11,628
Oh he doesn't know.
He didn't care who you are.

304
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:14,953
But we met before.

305
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,697
There was a long ago,
I was a kid at St. Swithin's ...

306
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:22,176
Used to funded by The
Wayne Foundation.

307
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:23,331
It's an orphanage.

308
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:26,928
My mother died when I
was small in a car accident.

309
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,627
But I don't remember it.

310
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:32,496
My dad got shot a
couple of years later

311
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:34,620
for a gambling debt.

312
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:38,554
Oh I remember that one just fine.

313
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:47,565
Not a lot of people knows what it
feels like to be angry in your bones.

314
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:53,548
I mean they understand.
The fosters parents.

315
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,942
Everybody understands ...

316
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:57,926
...For a while.

317
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,526
Then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do

318
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,400
move on.

319
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,598
After a while they stop understanding.

320
00:28:06,722 --> 00:28:08,487
They send the angry little
kid to a boy's school.

321
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:10,311
I figured it out too late.

322
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:16,319
You got to learn to hide the anger,
practice smiling in the mirror.

323
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:19,784
It's like putting on a mask.

324
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:23,716
So you show up this one
day, in a cool car,

325
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,932
pretty girl in your arms.

326
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:31,879
You were so excited!
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan?

327
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,508
We used to make up stories
about you man, legends ...

328
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,332
and you know the other kids,
that's all it was, it's just stories.

329
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,798
But when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

330
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,680
I seen that look on your face before.

331
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,927
It's the same one that
I taught myself.

332
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:56,017
I don't why you take the
fault of Dent's murder

333
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:59,412
but I still a believer in The Batman.

334
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:02,692
Even if you're not...

335
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,238
Why did you say that
your boy's home

336
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:09,056
used to be funded by
The Wayne Foundation?

337
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,904
Because the money stopped.

338
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:12,955
About time to get some fresh air

339
00:29:12,956 --> 00:29:15,654
and start paying attention
to the details.

340
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:19,462
Some of that details
might need your help.

341
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,786
Have you checked that name, Bane?

342
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:24,180
He's a mercenary.
No names.

343
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:27,125
He and he's man were
behind a coup in West Africa.

344
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:32,207
They've secured a mining operations
for our friend, John Daggett.

345
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:35,176
- And Daggett brought them here.
- So it seems.

346
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,835
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

347
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:43,164
Alfred, why did The
Wayne Foundation

348
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,554
stopped funding the
boy's home in the city?

349
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:52,142
The foundation is funded by the
profits of Wayne Enterprises.

350
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,044
There have to be some ...

351
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,471
Time to talk to Mr. Fox I think.

352
00:29:56,474 --> 00:29:58,271
I'll get him on the phone.

353
00:29:58,272 --> 00:30:01,657
No. Did we still have any
car around the place?

354
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,701
Yes, one or two

355
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,909
I need an appointment at
a hospital for my leg.

356
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,488
- Which hospital?
- Which ever one Jim Gordon's in.

357
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,351
I've seen worst cartilage in knees.

358
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:16,556
- It's a good?
- No.

359
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,260
That's because there's no
cartilage in your knees

360
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:22,278
and not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders.

361
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:24,761
Between that and scar
tissue on your kidney,

362
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:27,257
residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue

363
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:29,989
and the general scar over
quality of your body,

364
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,427
I cannot recommend you to
go heli-skiing, Mr. Wayne.

365
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:34,909
Right.

366
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:55,080
We're in this together.
I thought you were gone.

367
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,488
The Batman wasn't needed
anymore. We won...

368
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:01,803
We strung a lie.

369
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:08,002
Now there's evil rises again
where we try to bury him.

370
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:12,302
The Batman has to come back.

371
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:15,403
And if he doesn't exist anymore?

372
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:21,890
He must. You ...

373
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:34,684
<i>You got them wallet, do you?</i>

374
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:37,591
- You took my wallet!
- No I didn't!

375
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,490
- Get out!
- She took my wallet...

376
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,011
Now!

377
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:43,910
Crazy!

378
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:46,273
I don't know why he's so upset
about. It's only 60 bucks in here.

379
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:49,006
You got to wear the watch.

380
00:32:03,232 --> 00:32:04,008
Who's that?

381
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,039
Another stiff convety climb
out of his sport car.

382
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:08,146
Well that's Bruce Wayne!

383
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:11,532
Bruce Wayne, over here!

384
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,437
- I'm not sure if my assistant ...
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne.

385
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,556
Thank you so much.

386
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,726
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

387
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,797
Ms. Tate, is it not?

388
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,536
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these events.

389
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,796
Proceeds goes to big fat spread.

390
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:37,868
This is not about charity.

391
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:42,739
It's about feeding the ego which
ever society hag laid this on.

392
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,610
Actually this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

393
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,512
And the proceeds will go
where they should,

394
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,044
because I paid for the big
fat spread myself.

395
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:54,714
You spread generously?

396
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,148
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

397
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,025
Take our clean energy project.

398
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,786
Sometimes, the investments
just doesn't pay off.

399
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:05,403
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:08,101
You have a practiced
absent, Mr. Wayne.

401
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,441
But a man who does not care about the
world doesn’t spend half his fortune

402
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,690
on a plan to save it.

403
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:20,709
And isn't so wounded when it's
fail but he goes into hiding

404
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:23,596
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne!

405
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:28,900
Mind if I cut in?

406
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:31,423
Thank you.

407
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:35,944
You're don't seem happy to see me.

408
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,484
- You're suppose to be a shut-in.
- I felt like some fresh air.

409
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:42,283
Why didn't you called the police?

410
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,659
I have a powerful friend who
deals with things like these.

411
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:50,520
It's a brazing costume
for a cat burglar.

412
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:55,937
- Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
- Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

413
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:58,962
- Who's your date?
- His wife is in Ibiza.

414
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:02,863
She left her diamonds behind
though, worried it might get stolen.

415
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:05,217
It pronounced 'Ibitha'.

416
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:08,647
You wouldn't want any of these folks
realizing you're a crook now.

417
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:09,475
Social planner.

418
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:13,282
You think I care what everyone
in this rooms thinks of me?

419
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:16,887
I doubt you care anyone in
any room who thinks of you.

420
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:20,862
Don't candescent, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know me a thing about me.

421
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,304
Well Selina Kyle.

422
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,508
I know you came here from
your walk-out Old Town,

423
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,433
a modest place for a
master jewel thief.

424
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,708
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement

425
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:34,239
or you in deep with
the wrong people.

426
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:37,073
You don't to get judge
just because you

427
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,283
were born the master
bedroom of Wayne....

428
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:40,754
Actually, I was born in
the Regency room.

429
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:43,416
I started out doing what I had to.

430
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:46,266
Once you're done
what you had to,

431
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,136
They never let you do
what you wanted to.

432
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,946
Start fresh.

433
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:52,976
There's no fresh start
in today's world.

434
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:55,980
Any 12 years with a cell phone
would find out what you did.

435
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,206
Everything we do is collated
and quantified everything sticks.

436
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,857
Is that how you justify stealing?

437
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,555
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

438
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:07,797
I don't stand on the shoulders
of the people with less.

439
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:08,969
Robin Hood?

440
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:12,049
I think I do more to help someone
than most of the people in this room.

441
00:35:12,146 --> 00:35:13,710
Than you.

442
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,407
I think maybe you're
assuming a little too much.

443
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:18,906
Maybe you're being
unrealistic about what's

444
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:21,146
really in your pants
other than wallets.

445
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:21,706
Ouch.

446
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,288
You think all this can last?

447
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,288
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

448
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:30,682
You and your friends better
battered down the hatches.

449
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:33,091
Because when it hits,
you're all going to wonder

450
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:36,758
you could ever thought
you could live so large

451
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,782
and leave so little
for the rest of us.

452
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:46,082
You sound like you're
looking forward to it.

453
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:48,382
I'm adaptable.

454
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,186
Those pearls do look better
on you than it did in my safe,

455
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:55,166
but I still can't let you keep them.

456
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:05,011
You scared her off!

457
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,503
Not likely ...

458
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,516
I still lost my ticket.

459
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,721
Your wife said you're
taking the cab home.

460
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:15,245
My wife?

461
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,509
Just you, sir?

462
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,505
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

463
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,741
Takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things.

464
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:39,673
Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe

465
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:43,597
What brings you out of
prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

466
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,224
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor,

467
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,805
even if you have lost
most of my money.

468
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,529
Actually you did that.

469
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:52,447
If you follow all your
entire RND budget

470
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:55,429
to a fusion project
that you get mock more.

471
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,576
Your company is unlikely to thrive.

472
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,305
What are the options?

473
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,623
Well if you're not unwilling
to turn on the machine,

474
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:04,276
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

475
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:06,404
Well then sit tight.

476
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:08,331
Your majority keep dagger at bay

477
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:12,808
while we figured out a future for the
energy program with Miranda Tate.

478
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,746
She has supported the
project all the way.

479
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,293
She's smart and quite lovely.

480
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,530
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

481
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,916
- Show her the machine.
- I think it over.

482
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:31,807
- Anything else?
- Nope. Why?

483
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:36,292
Well these conversation used to
end with an unusual request.

484
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,632
I retired.

485
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:42,604
Let me show you some stuff, anyway.

486
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,556
Just for old times' sake.

487
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:54,554
I figured you had to
shut this place down.

488
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:57,243
Oh, it was always shut down.
Officially.

489
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,769
What's the new stuff ...

490
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,070
After your father died,
Wayne Enterprises

491
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,544
has set up 14 different
defense subsidiaries.

492
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:06,105
For years, I've been
shuttering and consolidating

493
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:08,325
all the different prototypes
under one roof.

494
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,396
- My roof.
- Why?

495
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:13,339
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

496
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,092
Now you just showing off.

497
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,609
It's a defense department project.

498
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:25,113
Tight Geometer Urban Pacification.

499
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:27,590
Rotors are configured to
maneuver between buildings

500
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:30,056
without recirculation.

501
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:32,193
What it's call?

502
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:36,704
It has a long uninteresting
Wayne Enterprise’s designation.

503
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:40,231
I just the took of calling it The Bat.

504
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:44,113
And yes Mr. Wayne,
it does come in black.

505
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:48,758
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

506
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,943
Takes a better mind
than mine to fix it.

507
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:52,583
A better mind?

508
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,919
Well I was trying to be modest.

509
00:38:56,205 --> 00:39:00,012
A less busy mind, yours.

510
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:08,936
It should be a bit painful.

511
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:10,736
You'll be very welcome to try, Alfred.

512
00:39:10,836 --> 00:39:13,837
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

513
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,855
Not bad ...

514
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,438
Not bad at all!

515
00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:30,538
If you're seriously considering
going back out there,

516
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:33,049
you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

517
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:34,847
I'm all ears.

518
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:38,246
There is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world.

519
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:44,338
A pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die.

520
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:48,238
But sometimes a man
rises from the darkness.

521
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:52,439
Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

522
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:54,939
- Bane!
- Right.

523
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:57,940
Born and raised in hell on earth.

524
00:39:58,141 --> 00:39:59,144
Born in a prison?

525
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:01,944
No one knows why or how he escaped.

526
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:09,017
But they do know once he did, he was
trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.

527
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:11,609
Bane was a member of
The League of Shadows.

528
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,967
And then he was excommunicated.

529
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:17,889
And any man who is too
extreme for Ra's Al Ghul,

530
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,075
is not to be trifled with.

531
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,883
I didn't realized I was known
for trifling with criminals.

532
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,515
That was then.

533
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,887
Then you can just strap up your
leg and put your mask back on,

534
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,067
but that doesn't make
you what you were.

535
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:36,202
If this man is everything what you
say he is, then the city ​​need me.

536
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:41,521
The city needs Bruce Wayne,
your resources, your knowledge.

537
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,672
It doesn't need your
body or your life.

538
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:46,761
That times has past.

539
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:50,041
You're afraid if I go back
out there, I'll fail.

540
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:51,897
No.

541
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,324
I'm afraid that you want to.

542
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,818
You can't short the stock if
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

543
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:15,291
Wayne's coming back has change.

544
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:17,991
- Changes, is it good or bad?
- I vote bad.

545
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:21,029
- On what basis?
- I flip the coin.

546
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:29,304
I said no rye man.

547
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:35,491
Rookie! Loose the helmet!
We need faces for camera.

548
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,694
Come on let's go scalping.

549
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,942
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

550
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:50,645
Really? Then why are you people here?

551
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,577
You got to get in there!

552
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,681
- It's a hostage situation.
- No! This is a robbery!

553
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:21,993
They have direct access to
the online trading desk.

554
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:24,496
I'm not risking my men
for your money.

555
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,297
Sir, you going to ask you to move.
We have a situation here.

556
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:32,490
It's not our money,
it's everybody's.

557
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,756
Really? Mine is in my mattress.

558
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:36,168
If don't put these guys down,

559
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,602
that something in your mattress maybe
be worth a whole hell of a lot less.

560
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:42,020
Cut the fiber cable and
take out that cell tower.

561
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:44,223
- Thank you.
- That will slow them down.

562
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:51,994
They cut the Fiber.

563
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:56,430
- The cell's working.
- For now.

564
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,676
Get all this barriers up.

565
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:03,539
I want all of them up.

566
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,172
No one gets in or out of
any of these streets.

567
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,560
- Where am I suppose to move it?
- Back it up.

568
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:15,141
Just stay in your vehicle, okay?

569
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,014
How much longer does
the program needs?

570
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:27,804
Eight minutes.

571
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,096
Time to go move out.

572
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,645
Everybody up!

573
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:37,223
You two, move!

574
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:41,459
Thank you.

575
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,140
Steady!

576
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:53,515
Steady!

577
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:03,136
I got something!

578
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,879
Do not shoot! We've hostages!

579
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,528
Hold your fire!

580
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,667
Go! Go!

581
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:31,006
Hey, let me go!

582
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:34,393
Please! Hey!

583
00:45:36,172 --> 00:45:39,223
- Shoot the tires!
- There's no shot.

584
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:43,714
Now back off! Back off!
They've got hostages!

585
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,870
<i>Police are pursuing
the 4 suspects from</i>

586
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,034
<i>downtown in respond to
a hostage situation</i>

587
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:49,273
Gotham PD...

588
00:45:55,331 --> 00:45:57,237
What's going on with the lights?

589
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:05,898
I can't pick up anything!

590
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:07,047
Who the hell was that?

591
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:10,456
Oh boy you're in for
a show tonight, son!

592
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:17,454
Please! Help!

593
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:37,021
Sorry!

594
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:39,619
Put that thing away before
you hurt yourself.

595
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,220
Get in!

596
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,219
Let's go. You, get in the car!

597
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,219
We've spotted The Batman!

598
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:55,816
I want all everyone in.

599
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:58,117
Every car patrol, street
cops and off duty too.

600
00:46:58,217 --> 00:46:59,417
Call them in now!

601
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,212
I'm going to do what
Jim Gordon never could.

602
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:04,108
- What's that?
- I'm going to take down The Batman.

603
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:07,489
<i>..the 4 suspect are
carrying two hostages</i>

604
00:47:07,573 --> 00:47:09,672
<i>that they kidnapped them at
the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

605
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:11,443
<i>Witnesses reported that ...</i>

606
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:15,732
<i>It seems hard to believe.</i>

607
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:18,449
<i>But report are suspects
are now being pursued,</i>

608
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,299
<i>what appears to be, The Batman.</i>

609
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,601
Well what do you know..

610
00:47:27,051 --> 00:47:30,229
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

611
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:35,103
Please! Let me go! Please!

612
00:47:44,075 --> 00:47:45,148
<i>One bike has pulled off.</i>

613
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,239
<i>No hostage. Shall we pursue?</i>

614
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:54,335
Negative. Stay on The Batman!

615
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:58,380
- He's getting away.
- Who do you want to catch huh?

616
00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:01,401
Some robber or the son-of-a-bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

617
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,515
Eight years and he
has to pick tonight.

618
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:16,059
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

619
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:28,476
Please! Just let me go! Please!

620
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:04,266
TRANSFERRING COMPLETE

621
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:47,467
<i>We lost him.</i>

622
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:49,425
How could you lose him?

623
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:50,924
<i>He's got a lot of firepower.</i>

624
00:49:51,065 --> 00:49:53,221
And what? You don't?

625
00:49:57,277 --> 00:49:59,175
<i>He heads back downtown.</i>

626
00:49:59,238 --> 00:50:01,162
and he's as dumb as he dresses.

627
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:03,248
Close it up, gentlemen!

628
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,390
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen!

629
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,812
I might've the wrong
animal there, sir!

630
00:50:57,205 --> 00:50:59,207
You're sure it was him?

631
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:09,148
<i>Bane says that Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.</i>

632
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:10,928
What about the men they've arrested?

633
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:15,733
He said and I quote:
'They would die before talking.'

634
00:51:16,499 --> 00:51:19,233
Where does he finds these guys?

635
00:51:20,332 --> 00:51:22,369
Open the champagne!

636
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:28,663
- And can we get some girls in here?
- Be careful what you wish for!

637
00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:42,018
- Cat got your tongue?
- You dumb bitch!

638
00:51:42,123 --> 00:51:44,247
Nobody ever accuse of being dumb.

639
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:47,881
You're dumb, for coming here tonight.

640
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,568
I want what you owe me.

641
00:51:52,189 --> 00:51:56,309
- One doesn't get ...
- Nice outfit!

642
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:58,415
Aren't those heels make
it tough to walk?

643
00:51:58,522 --> 00:52:02,291
I don't know, do you think?

644
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:04,973
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

645
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:07,457
The program ' The Clean Slate'.

646
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,002
The Ultimate Tool for a
master thief with a record.

647
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:13,162
Hold it right there!

648
00:52:26,673 --> 00:52:30,082
- Where is it?!
- 'The Clean Slate?'

649
00:52:30,172 --> 00:52:32,130
When you type in someone's
name, date of birth

650
00:52:32,177 --> 00:52:36,632
and a few minutes they're gone,
every database on earth.

651
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:39,301
Sounds a little too good to be true?

652
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:43,266
You're lying! RIKEN DATA took
it to the prototype stage.

653
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:45,465
That's why I bought them.

654
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:50,720
But they had nothing.
It was a gang-land myth.

655
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:03,337
Stay back!

656
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:08,073
I'm not bluffing!

657
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:12,314
They know! They just don't care.

658
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:32,030
- You got to be kidding me.
- No guns, no killing.

659
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,671
Where the fun in that?

660
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:54,792
My mother warned about getting
into cars with strange men.

661
00:53:54,884 --> 00:53:56,993
This isn't a car.

662
00:54:46,518 --> 00:54:48,177
See you around!

663
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:50,464
You're welcome!

664
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:53,570
- I had it under control.
- Those weren't street thugs.

665
00:54:53,711 --> 00:54:57,225
They were trained killers.
I saved your life.

666
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,016
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

667
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:05,524
Wayne wasn't kidding
about a powerful friend.

668
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:08,650
I sold his prints to Daggett.

669
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:12,503
Something that doesn't even exist.

670
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,822
I doubt that will get the
better of you.

671
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:17,995
- Hey when a girl's desperate...
- What's he going to do with them?

672
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:19,977
I don't know but
Dagget seem pretty

673
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:22,324
interested in that mess
at the stock market.

674
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:29,882
Miss Kyle ...

675
00:55:32,169 --> 00:55:34,853
So that's what that feels like...

676
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:55,743
I seen you in the
television coverage,

677
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:58,429
you've got your taste for
wanting destruction back.

678
00:55:58,528 --> 00:56:00,229
There are 3 disks.

679
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,145
Aren't the police suppose
to be investigating them?

680
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:05,048
They don't have the
tools to analyze it.

681
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:06,749
They would if you gave it to them.

682
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:09,441
One man's tool is another man weapon.

683
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:10,415
In your mind perhaps,

684
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,746
but there aren't many things
can't turn into a weapons.

685
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:14,849
Alfred, enough!
The police weren't getting it done

686
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,150
Maybe they might have. If you hadn't
made the side show of yourself.

687
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,751
You I didn't had it in me.

688
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,051
No! You got to glow at the
police force, a married chased

689
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,350
with a lot of fancy
new toys from Fox's.

690
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,151
What about when you
come up against him?

691
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,349
What then?

692
00:56:28,448 --> 00:56:29,542
I'll fight harder. I always have.

693
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:33,439
Take a look, his speed,
his ferocity, his training.

694
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:36,047
I see the power of believe.

695
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:39,234
I see The League of Shadows insurgent.

696
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,932
- You said he was excommunicated.
- By Ra's Al Ghul.

697
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:45,232
Who leads them now?

698
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:47,632
Ra's Al Ghul was The League
of Shadows and I beat him.

699
00:56:47,732 --> 00:56:50,532
Bane is just a mercenary,
we need to find out what he's up to.

700
00:56:51,896 --> 00:56:55,208
Trade of some kind. Coded.

701
00:56:55,297 --> 00:56:58,222
And my fingerprints
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

702
00:56:58,318 --> 00:56:59,330
Give this to Fox.

703
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:00,804
He can crack the code

704
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:03,867
and tell us what trades
they were executing.

705
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:11,196
I'll give this to Mr. Fox but no more.

706
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:16,618
I sewed you up, I set your
bums but I wont bury you.

707
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:20,667
I buried enough members in
The Wayne family.

708
00:57:20,762 --> 00:57:21,852
You're leaving me?

709
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:25,889
You see only one end
to your journey.

710
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:30,865
Leaving is all I have to
make you understand.

711
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:34,706
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

712
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,210
You used to talked about finishing
about a light on that awful cave.

713
00:57:39,303 --> 00:57:42,886
Alfred, Rachel died knowing
that we had decided to be together.

714
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,621
That was my life,
beyond the cave.

715
00:57:44,718 --> 00:57:47,290
I can't just move on.

716
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:50,938
She didn't, she couldn't have.

717
00:57:50,984 --> 00:57:54,195
- What did she had?
- You know I can't change that.

718
00:57:54,293 --> 00:57:57,343
And if, before she died,
she wrote a letter

719
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,833
saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

720
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:09,865
And what if to spare your pain....

721
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:14,006
I burned that letter ...?

722
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:18,482
How dare you use Rachel
to try and stop me.

723
00:58:18,573 --> 00:58:21,727
I am using to choose
Master Wayne.

724
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:25,059
Maybe it's time we all start
trying to out smart the truth

725
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:28,607
and let it have it stay.

726
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,071
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

727
00:58:31,186 --> 00:58:34,649
You expect to destroy my world ...

728
00:58:36,037 --> 00:58:39,140
...and then think we're
going to shake hands?

729
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:41,259
No.

730
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:45,252
- I know what this means.
- What is it means?

731
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:50,028
It means your hatred and it
also mean losing someone.

732
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:53,357
Who I've cared kept
for since I first heard

733
00:58:53,477 --> 00:58:59,121
his cries echoes through this house.

734
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:04,517
But it might also mean
saving your life.

735
00:59:04,735 --> 00:59:08,479
And that's more important.

736
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,906
Good bye, Alfred!

737
00:59:33,397 --> 00:59:35,824
Alfred?

738
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:42,101
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

739
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:45,360
Page three.

740
00:59:45,484 --> 00:59:49,652
Seem you made a series a laud of
put options on the future exchange.

741
00:59:49,757 --> 00:59:51,287
Verified by thumb print.

742
00:59:51,396 --> 00:59:53,864
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

743
00:59:53,968 --> 00:59:57,264
Long term we may be able to prove
it was a fraud but for now,

744
00:59:57,265 --> 00:59:58,710
you're completely broke.

745
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:02,579
and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

746
01:00:02,736 --> 01:00:04,156
The weapons ...

747
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:06,654
We can't let Daggett get his
hands on the applied sciences.

748
01:00:06,748 --> 01:00:09,788
Applied sciences is all lock
up and off the books.

749
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,981
The energy project however
is a different story.

750
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,871
Miranda Tate ...

751
01:00:15,669 --> 01:00:17,654
We need to convince the
board to get behind her.

752
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:18,803
Let's show her the reactor.

753
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:22,501
We're meeting her there in 35
minutes so you better get dressed.

754
01:00:22,715 --> 01:00:25,944
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

755
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,892
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

756
01:00:32,506 --> 01:00:36,394
Please keep hands and
feet in the car at all time.

757
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:43,869
This is it, isn't it?

758
01:00:43,962 --> 01:00:45,974
The reactor is beneath the river

759
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,604
So it can be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach.

760
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:54,651
Is Bruce Wayne
really that paranoid?

761
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:57,376
I fail to give an answer on that one.

762
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:06,805
I thought you might like to see
what your investment builds.

763
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,218
No fossil fuels, free clean
energy for an entire city!

764
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:14,707
Three years ago, a Russian
scientist published

765
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,582
a paper on weaponize
fusion reactions.

766
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:22,871
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

767
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:25,397
I think this machine works.

768
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:32,309
Miranda, if it were operational,
danger to Gotham would be too great.

769
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:35,667
Would it make you feel better
to know that the Russian

770
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:38,518
scientist died in a plane
crash six months ago?

771
01:01:38,643 --> 01:01:42,280
Someone been working
hard with Dr. Pavel.

772
01:01:42,391 --> 01:01:45,394
Someone will figured
out the way for make

773
01:01:45,395 --> 01:01:48,396
this power source into
a nuclear weapon.

774
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:55,990
I need you to take control of Wayne
Enterprises and this reactor.

775
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:58,529
- To do what with it?
- Nothing.

776
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:03,041
- Until we can guarantee it's safety.
- And if we can't?

777
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:04,807
Decommission it, flood it.

778
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:08,749
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

779
01:02:08,842 --> 01:02:10,535
The world is not ready, yes.

780
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:14,992
Bruce, if you want to save the world
you have to start trusting it.

781
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:16,085
I'm trust you.

782
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:18,725
It doesn't count.
You have no choice.

783
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:21,853
I could've flooded this chamber at
any time in the last three years.

784
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:26,168
I choosing to trust you. Please ...

785
01:02:33,478 --> 01:02:37,578
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
this meeting will now come to order.

786
01:02:37,678 --> 01:02:40,771
You know, I would like to point out that
we have a non-board member here.

787
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:44,469
There is highly irregular, even if
his name is above the door.

788
01:02:44,569 --> 01:02:46,770
Bruce Wayne's family
built this company.

789
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:50,956
- and he himself has run it ...
- Into the ground, sir!

790
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:52,156
Does anybody disagrees?

791
01:02:52,256 --> 01:02:53,556
Check the share prices this morning.

792
01:02:53,656 --> 01:02:58,817
Crazy gambling on future not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat,

793
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:03,156
it has cost us all a lot of
money and he has to go.

794
01:03:03,256 --> 01:03:06,357
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

795
01:03:13,758 --> 01:03:15,458
Well back to business.

796
01:03:17,156 --> 01:03:18,856
How does it feel to be
one of the people, Wayne?

797
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:20,759
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car..

798
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:22,861
I didn't know that you're
off the board.

799
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:26,773
Looks like you'll need a ride huh?

800
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:29,546
Mr. Wayne, will you get a ride?

801
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:33,462
What the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne Board?

802
01:03:33,569 --> 01:03:36,014
I mean, is she been meeting with him?
Is she been sleeping with him?

803
01:03:36,015 --> 01:03:36,758
Not that we know of.

804
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:39,884
Oh clearly you don't know much
of anything, do you? Where's Bane?

805
01:03:39,964 --> 01:03:42,307
- You told him it was urgent.
- Where is that man now?

806
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:45,924
Speak of the devil,
and he shall appears.

807
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:49,083
What the hell is going on?

808
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:52,227
The plan is preceding as expected.

809
01:03:52,324 --> 01:03:56,362
Really? Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

810
01:03:56,471 --> 01:04:00,345
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work my friend.

811
01:04:00,428 --> 01:04:03,055
And now you have my
construction crews

812
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:06,222
going around the city
at 24 hours a day.

813
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:11,857
How exactly is that suppose to help
my company absorbs Wayne?

814
01:04:13,946 --> 01:04:16,506
- Leave us!
- No! Stay here!

815
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,223
I'm in charge here.

816
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:22,279
Do you feel in charge?

817
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,079
I have paid you a small fortune.

818
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:31,489
And this gives you power over me?

819
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:33,219
What is this?

820
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:38,715
Your money and infrastructure
have been important ...

821
01:04:38,812 --> 01:04:40,363
...until now.

822
01:04:40,437 --> 01:04:43,518
- What are you?
- I'm Gotham reckoning.

823
01:04:43,628 --> 01:04:47,114
It'll end of all the damn
you've been living on.

824
01:04:48,547 --> 01:04:51,749
You are pure evil.

825
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:54,802
- A necessary evil.
- No!

826
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:03,350
Well you've started quite a mess.

827
01:05:03,507 --> 01:05:05,225
To protect the people closes to me.

828
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:07,171
Maybe you're a loner, right?
You didn't have a family.

829
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:09,287
There are always people
that you care about.

830
01:05:11,317 --> 01:05:13,875
But you didn't realize how
much until they're gone.

831
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:16,868
The idea was to be a symbol.

832
01:05:16,962 --> 01:05:22,331
Batman can be anyone.
That was the point.

833
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,734
- Well it damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

834
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:27,533
I'll figured that out in the end.

835
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:30,302
Do you got anything on
Bane's whereabouts?

836
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:34,023
Yes, I have 500 pages of tunnel
records and a flashlight.

837
01:05:34,116 --> 01:05:35,843
I could use some help actually.

838
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:39,153
You know what,
drop me in the old town.

839
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:46,453
<i>- I don't think so!
- That is not how it works.</i>

840
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:48,602
He's not a mark.

841
01:05:48,714 --> 01:05:51,454
and he doesn't have a
cent to his name anyway.

842
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:56,234
Yeah. It's not much, but it's
more than you got right now.

843
01:05:56,388 --> 01:05:59,204
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

844
01:05:59,311 --> 01:06:01,989
The rich doesn't even go
broke like the rest of us huh?

845
01:06:02,097 --> 01:06:06,210
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

846
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:08,770
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

847
01:06:08,912 --> 01:06:11,981
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

848
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:14,836
- He wants to meet tonight.
- Why?

849
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,002
He needs to find Bane.
He says you know how.

850
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:26,023
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay. I like your place.

851
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:29,591
Mr. Wayne!

852
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:34,046
I'm sorry they took all your money.

853
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:36,591
No you're not.

854
01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:39,422
- Can we help you officer?
- Yeah.

855
01:06:39,531 --> 01:06:42,347
John Daggett's body was found
in a dumpster an hour ago.

856
01:06:42,348 --> 01:06:44,818
Thought you might wanna know.

857
01:06:44,947 --> 01:06:45,970
Why?

858
01:06:45,979 --> 01:06:47,798
Well his name is all
over this permit I just

859
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,455
pulled to half the
tunnel under Gotham.

860
01:06:49,582 --> 01:06:53,633
That's MTA maintenance, sewer
construction and others things...

861
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:55,973
What did you get with the
tunnel searches?

862
01:06:57,038 --> 01:07:00,287
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hot heads out.

863
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:02,313
We had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

864
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:03,983
Well get more then.

865
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,018
Work the grid.
I want him found.

866
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,467
Yeah, the masked man. We're on it.

867
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,384
Lose the uniform.
You’re working for me now.

868
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:13,922
We could some hot head around here.

869
01:07:14,078 --> 01:07:15,788
Sir, Daggett's death could
only be a coincidence.

870
01:07:15,897 --> 01:07:17,664
You're a detective now, son.

871
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:21,628
You're not allowed to believe in
coincidences anymore.

872
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:35,929
- Nobody's answering.
- No ...

873
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:40,250
- I'm on my own now.
- Do you have keys?

874
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:42,718
I never needed them.

875
01:07:49,018 --> 01:07:51,283
I hope you didn't liked
reaching my money.

876
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:53,628
Suffering this character.

877
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,315
I'll take care of your
parents legacy, Bruce.

878
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:06,918
Who's this?

879
01:08:13,816 --> 01:08:15,709
Where is Alfred?

880
01:08:17,006 --> 01:08:18,908
He left.

881
01:08:20,214 --> 01:08:22,116
...taking everything...

882
01:08:46,013 --> 01:08:51,012
- What's that?
- Our power has been shut off.

883
01:08:56,112 --> 01:08:58,210
You're good at that.

884
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:01,311
When I was a child, we
had almost nothing.

885
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:07,214
But on the nights when we had
a fire, We felt very rich indeed...

886
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:11,627
I assumed your family was wealthy.

887
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:16,126
Not always not when I was young.

888
01:09:16,723 --> 01:09:21,410
- It's an old mistake.
- I had a few myself.

889
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:25,113
More than a few.

890
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:30,310
I could leave tonight.

891
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:35,116
Take my plane and go
anywhere we wanted.

892
01:09:36,325 --> 01:09:40,619
Some day perhaps. Not tonight.

893
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,014
Don't be shy!

894
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:15,221
Wayne said that you can
get me the 'Clean Slate'.

895
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:18,521
- That depends ...
- On what?

896
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,217
On what you want it for..

897
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:23,414
I have acquire it to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

898
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:26,014
Still don't trust me huh...

899
01:10:26,213 --> 01:10:31,132
- How can we change that?
- Start by taking me to Bane.

900
01:10:34,073 --> 01:10:35,856
You asked...

901
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:40,202
From here, Bane's man
patrol the tunnels

902
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:42,496
and they're not your
average brawlers.

903
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,779
Neither am I.

904
01:10:52,365 --> 01:10:53,412
- He's behind you!
- Who?

905
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,975
Me!

906
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:01,309
Where do you think you're going? ...

907
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:15,867
Less a little bully.

908
01:11:23,353 --> 01:11:26,106
I had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me.

909
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:28,914
You made a serious mistake.

910
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:32,131
Not as serious as yours ...

911
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:34,363
...I fear.

912
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:42,415
- Bane ...
- Let's not stand on so moody here.

913
01:11:43,114 --> 01:11:46,097
Mr. Wayne ...

914
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:58,715
Peace has cost you your strength.

915
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,292
Victory has defeated you.

916
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:05,647
The adaptability and deception ...

917
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,486
powerful agents ...
to the uninitiated people.

918
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:12,230
But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce?

919
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:14,990
Members of the League of Shadows.

920
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:19,558
And you betrayed us.

921
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:26,286
Yes. You were excommunicated
by a gang of psychopaths.

922
01:13:30,015 --> 01:13:33,321
I am the League of Shadows.

923
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:37,360
I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny!

924
01:13:50,261 --> 01:13:54,487
You fight like a younger man,
there's nothing held back.

925
01:13:54,832 --> 01:13:58,909
It's admirable, but mistaken.

926
01:14:02,498 --> 01:14:06,133
You think darkness is your ally?

927
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:12,047
You've merely adopted the
dark, I was born in it.

928
01:14:12,174 --> 01:14:15,377
Molded by it ...

929
01:14:15,561 --> 01:14:18,948
I didn't see the light until
I was already a man.

930
01:14:19,072 --> 01:14:22,103
By then was nothing to be blinded.

931
01:14:24,664 --> 01:14:29,165
Shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

932
01:14:33,954 --> 01:14:37,559
I'll show you where I had made my home.

933
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:41,252
Whilst preparing to bring justice.

934
01:14:43,196 --> 01:14:45,899
Then I will break you.

935
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:58,369
Your precious armory!
Great fully accepted.

936
01:14:58,466 --> 01:15:00,770
We'll need it.

937
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:13,032
Ah yes! I was wondering
what would weight first...

938
01:15:17,227 --> 01:15:19,314
Your spirit ...

939
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,491
...or your body?

940
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,401
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

941
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,501
I got a line up of Congressman's
kidnapping.

942
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:26,599
- Excuse me, miss!
- Yes?

943
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:29,901
I'm going to need to see your
ticket and identification, please.

944
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:32,704
Do you mind?

945
01:16:44,802 --> 01:16:47,701
I showed your picture to The
Congressman. Guess what?!

946
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:52,101
- Don't tell me. Still in love?
- Oh head over heels.

947
01:16:52,301 --> 01:16:54,001
Pressing charges though.

948
01:16:54,201 --> 01:16:57,900
You've made some mistakes, Miss Kyle.

949
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:01,895
- Girl's got to eat.
- And you have an appetite.

950
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:04,298
Why would run? You can't hide
from us with a record like this.

951
01:17:04,398 --> 01:17:08,613
- Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
- Who then? Bane?

952
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:10,304
What do you know about him?

953
01:17:10,404 --> 01:17:14,300
About you should be as
afraid of him as I am.

954
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,500
You can offer you protection.

955
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,101
Okay ...

956
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,600
When I spotted you, I was looking for
a friend of mine, Bruce Wayne.

957
01:17:31,936 --> 01:17:33,738
Did that killed him?

958
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:37,438
I'm not sure.

959
01:17:56,830 --> 01:18:01,654
Why didn't you just kill me?

960
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:05,727
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

961
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:08,931
Your punishment must be mastered here.

962
01:18:08,932 --> 01:18:12,447
- You're the charger?
- Yes.

963
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:16,323
But not of your body.

964
01:18:18,914 --> 01:18:21,103
Of your soul.

965
01:18:21,104 --> 01:18:25,292
- Where am I?
- Home.

966
01:18:25,293 --> 01:18:31,182
Where I learned the truth
about despair, as will you.

967
01:18:31,217 --> 01:18:35,616
There's a reason why this
prison were a hell on earth.

968
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:37,364
Hope.

969
01:18:37,365 --> 01:18:41,079
Every man who has lotted here over
the centuries looked up to the light

970
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,794
and imagine climbing to freedom.

971
01:18:44,795 --> 01:18:49,467
So easy, so simple!

972
01:18:49,468 --> 01:18:55,720
Unless you break man turning into
seawater for uncontrollably fast.

973
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,865
Many have died trying.

974
01:18:59,866 --> 01:19:04,998
And then here can be no
true despair without hope.

975
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:07,220
So as I terrorize Gotham,

976
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:12,017
I will feed it's deeper
hole to poison their souls.

977
01:19:12,718 --> 01:19:15,524
I would let them live
so they can survived

978
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:18,787
and you can watch them
trampling over each other

979
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:22,081
...to stay in the sun.

980
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,953
You could watch me
torturing an entire city.

981
01:19:27,954 --> 01:19:32,209
And then when you truly understood
the depth of your failure,

982
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,954
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghu's destiny.

983
01:19:38,603 --> 01:19:41,728
We will destroy Gotham.

984
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:49,946
and then, what would you've
done, when Gotham is ashes ...

985
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:58,865
Then you have my permission to die.

986
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,937
You're locking her up in here?

987
01:20:13,972 --> 01:20:17,855
The Dent's act allowed non-segregation
based extraordinary needs.

988
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:20,905
First time she broke out of women
correctional, she was 16.

989
01:20:21,005 --> 01:20:25,297
- A little closer, honey!
- Why honey? You want to hold my hand?

990
01:20:25,681 --> 01:20:27,521
She's going to be fine.

991
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:31,828
I still don't see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project.

992
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:33,401
Bruce got a lot of things right,

993
01:20:33,402 --> 01:20:36,005
keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them.

994
01:20:38,803 --> 01:20:43,660
Oh good of you to join
us Chair President.

995
01:20:43,661 --> 01:20:47,316
All I need now is one more
Ordinary Board member.

996
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:54,359
- Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?
- No. I will volunteer.

997
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:56,658
Where are you taking us?

998
01:21:06,682 --> 01:21:08,025
You were right, Commissioner!

999
01:21:08,226 --> 01:21:09,810
Would you excuses us, please?

1000
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:10,848
What happened?

1001
01:21:10,983 --> 01:21:13,330
Your mask man kidnapped the
Wayne Enterprise’s Board.

1002
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:16,508
He let most of them go, but he took
three of them into the sewers.

1003
01:21:16,509 --> 01:21:18,711
No more patrols.
No more hide and seek.

1004
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:21,738
Get every available cop down
there and smoke him out.

1005
01:21:21,739 --> 01:21:26,009
- The Mayor won't want panic.
- So it's a training exercise?

1006
01:21:28,434 --> 01:21:31,255
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1007
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:35,254
Not you, you telling me
The Batman have gone.

1008
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:40,381
So you chase up the daggers
leads anyway you can.

1009
01:21:40,382 --> 01:21:41,830
Yes, sir.

1010
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:57,054
He asks how you much would
pay us to let you die?

1011
01:21:57,055 --> 01:21:59,895
I told him... I told him
you have nothing.

1012
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:01,521
You tell them pleasure!

1013
01:22:01,522 --> 01:22:05,786
I paid more than that to
keep you alive.

1014
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:14,814
You would try to climb.

1015
01:22:28,582 --> 01:22:31,695
He can win? Everybody has?

1016
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:34,529
Well of course not!

1017
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:47,115
He say there's one who did.

1018
01:22:47,116 --> 01:22:48,953
A child.

1019
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:53,115
A child born in this hell.

1020
01:22:53,314 --> 01:22:58,004
- Bane ...
- An old legend. Nothing more.

1021
01:23:02,919 --> 01:23:08,088
What they really tease me, you
wanted to see is happening soon.

1022
01:23:33,285 --> 01:23:35,554
Fire in the hole!

1023
01:24:03,127 --> 01:24:05,151
Turn it on!

1024
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:13,756
I only need one other Board member,
there are eight others waiting.

1025
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,355
I won't do it.

1026
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:17,830
Alright stop!

1027
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:21,192
Lucius, you will kill
this man and yourself,

1028
01:24:21,193 --> 01:24:23,732
and you'll barely
slow them down.

1029
01:24:49,063 --> 01:24:52,869
Go on then, do your work!

1030
01:24:55,072 --> 01:24:57,188
Take them up to the surface!

1031
01:24:57,189 --> 01:25:01,355
People of their status
deserve to experience

1032
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:04,966
the next era of
Western civilization.

1033
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,707
I had half of daggett some
of that plan some odd

1034
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,922
location they pour for
underground construction.

1035
01:25:12,923 --> 01:25:14,883
<i>anything strange about the pouring?</i>

1036
01:25:14,884 --> 01:25:19,378
Honestly, Commissioner. I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1037
01:25:19,379 --> 01:25:22,835
But knowing about
patterns. Keep looking!

1038
01:25:27,504 --> 01:25:32,674
It's done. This is now a
4 megatons nuclear bomb!

1039
01:25:34,197 --> 01:25:38,074
Pull the core out of the reactor!

1040
01:25:38,075 --> 01:25:40,641
No! You cannot!

1041
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:44,767
This is the power source
capable of sustaining it.

1042
01:25:44,768 --> 01:25:49,048
If you move it, the core will
depleted in a matter of months.

1043
01:25:49,049 --> 01:25:53,236
- Five, by my calculations.
- It will go off!

1044
01:25:54,729 --> 01:26:01,102
And for the sake of your children
Dr. Pavel, I did hope it does.

1045
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:04,179
Hey

1046
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:09,173
That was you in front of
The Stock Exchange wasn't it?

1047
01:26:10,066 --> 01:26:11,453
When?

1048
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:14,327
When half the city cops try
to pull onto castle street

1049
01:26:14,328 --> 01:26:16,024
and your truck was
shutting them out.

1050
01:26:16,025 --> 01:26:19,718
- Oh yeah ... you're the cop.
- Detective.

1051
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:24,003
And, as detective we're not allowed
to believe in coincidences.

1052
01:26:33,868 --> 01:26:36,627
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1053
01:26:44,388 --> 01:26:48,955
Commissioner it's Blake. I got two
dead witnesses and a lot of questions.

1054
01:26:48,956 --> 01:26:50,097
Call me when ...

1055
01:26:50,668 --> 01:26:54,662
Wait a minute!
Four barrels of polisobutilen.

1056
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:59,015
That looks like motor
oil right next to it. Jesus!

1057
01:26:59,016 --> 01:27:03,045
They're not making cement,
they're making explosive!

1058
01:27:09,535 --> 01:27:12,473
- Patch me through Foley!
<i>- Foley is overseeing the operation.</i>

1059
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:15,059
They're heading into a trap.

1060
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,307
We seeing literally thousand of
police heading into the sewer.

1061
01:27:17,308 --> 01:27:19,555
Mr. Mayor, literally thousands of police ...

1062
01:27:19,556 --> 01:27:21,568
It's just a training exercise that's all.

1063
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:22,843
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1064
01:27:22,844 --> 01:27:25,213
I got tickets to watch our
boys trash Rapid City.

1065
01:27:27,438 --> 01:27:28,281
Foley.

1066
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:29,978
<i>It's a trap.
Pull all of them out!</i>

1067
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:32,201
Bane has been pour concrete
rigs with explosives.

1068
01:27:32,202 --> 01:27:33,720
Where?

1069
01:27:48,959 --> 01:27:50,637
<i>There's a ring
surrounding the tunnels!

1070
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:53,027
They're going to blow it and
trap the cops underground!

1071
01:27:53,854 --> 01:27:57,147
Pull them out! Now!

1072
01:28:20,951 --> 01:28:23,523
That's a lovely lovely voice!

1073
01:29:04,059 --> 01:29:06,575
Let the games begin!

1074
01:30:40,237 --> 01:30:45,965
Citizens take control ...

1075
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:50,653
Take control of your city!

1076
01:30:55,339 --> 01:30:57,359
- Foley!
- Jesus, Blake!

1077
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,876
Every cop in the city is
down in those tunnels!

1078
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:01,975
Not every cop.

1079
01:31:16,056 --> 01:31:19,399
Sir, you're okay? I'm a police
officer, I need your car right now.

1080
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,978
Play the corners, rookie!

1081
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:14,762
Get the coat, son!

1082
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:21,270
This, this is the instrument
of your liberation.

1083
01:32:23,316 --> 01:32:26,458
Satellite show some radiation spike.

1084
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:29,638
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1085
01:32:33,475 --> 01:32:37,060
Identify yourself to the world!

1086
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:42,515
Dr Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1087
01:32:42,953 --> 01:32:46,579
Pavel was confirmed
dead, plane crash on an

1088
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:51,030
agency pull out of Uzbekistan
but it looks like it's him.

1089
01:32:51,031 --> 01:32:54,888
And what, What is this?

1090
01:32:54,889 --> 01:33:01,709
It's a fully prime neutron bomb
with a blast radius of 6 miles.

1091
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:06,144
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1092
01:33:07,355 --> 01:33:09,114
Only me.

1093
01:33:09,115 --> 01:33:14,063
Only you ... Thank you, good doctor!

1094
01:33:17,116 --> 01:33:20,438
Now, this bomb is armed.

1095
01:33:20,439 --> 01:33:27,439
This bomb is mobile and the identity
of the trigger man is a mystery.

1096
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:33,171
For one of you holds the detonator.

1097
01:33:33,172 --> 01:33:37,742
Now we came here not as
conquerors, but liberators

1098
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:42,313
to return control of this
city to the people.

1099
01:33:43,665 --> 01:33:48,949
At the first sight of interference
of the outside world,

1100
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:53,503
or to those people attempting to flee,

1101
01:33:54,737 --> 01:33:58,054
This anonymous Gotham-might,

1102
01:33:58,055 --> 01:34:02,912
this unsung hero will
trigger the bomb.

1103
01:34:04,277 --> 01:34:07,771
As of now, Martial Law is in effect.

1104
01:34:07,772 --> 01:34:10,976
Return to your homes,

1105
01:34:10,977 --> 01:34:16,468
hold your families
close and wait.

1106
01:34:16,469 --> 01:34:21,591
Tomorrow you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1107
01:34:25,967 --> 01:34:31,169
Hold back the fighters! Start
high level reconnaissance flights.

1108
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:34,105
Get the president on the line!

1109
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:58,641
<i>Tanks and planes cannot stop
us from detonating our device.

1110
01:34:58,642 --> 01:35:01,058
<i>Send a negotiator
to discuss term</i>

1111
01:35:01,059 --> 01:35:04,026
<i>of access to supplies
and communication!</i>

1112
01:35:09,577 --> 01:35:11,967
How many of you there, son?

1113
01:35:13,309 --> 01:35:15,065
You don't have
enough man to stop

1114
01:35:15,066 --> 01:35:17,389
12 million people from
leaving this island.

1115
01:35:18,289 --> 01:35:21,847
No, no we don't. But you do.

1116
01:35:23,043 --> 01:35:26,557
Why the hell would I try help
you to keep your hostages?

1117
01:35:26,558 --> 01:35:32,019
If one person crosses this bridge,
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1118
01:35:37,301 --> 01:35:40,093
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient</i>

1119
01:35:41,096 --> 01:35:45,910
<i>They have proven this before
and they will prove it again.</i>

1120
01:35:45,911 --> 01:35:50,331
<i>We do not negotiate with terrorists,</i>

1121
01:35:50,332 --> 01:35:53,274
<i>But we do recognize realities.</i>

1122
01:35:53,275 --> 01:36:00,356
<i>As this situation develops, one thing
must be understood above all others.</i>

1123
01:36:00,857 --> 01:36:04,369
<i>People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.</i>

1124
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:06,300
What does that mean?

1125
01:36:06,301 --> 01:36:09,168
It means we're on our own.

1126
01:36:09,169 --> 01:36:11,290
I have to get in front of a camera.

1127
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:14,323
Well sir, they will kill you the
second you show your face.

1128
01:36:14,324 --> 01:36:17,230
Bane says he's giving Gotham
back to the people.

1129
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:18,655
They need to know I could lead.

1130
01:36:18,656 --> 01:36:20,321
Bane is not going
to let that happen.

1131
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:23,703
- Then he will show his true colors
- Then you'd be dead.

1132
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:46,787
Behind you, stand a
symbol of oppression.

1133
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:52,556
Blackgate Prison, where
a thousand men has

1134
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:56,771
languished under the
name of this man:

1135
01:36:56,926 --> 01:37:00,099
Harvey Dent.

1136
01:37:00,134 --> 01:37:07,126
Who has been held to you as
the shinning example of justice.

1137
01:37:07,127 --> 01:37:09,800
We're just keep moving you until we
can get you in front of a camera.

1138
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:13,706
You have been supplied
with a false idol,

1139
01:37:13,707 --> 01:37:18,001
to stop you tearing
down this corrupt city!

1140
01:37:18,002 --> 01:37:22,446
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent!

1141
01:37:22,447 --> 01:37:27,194
From the prayers of
Gotham Police Commissioner.

1142
01:37:27,229 --> 01:37:30,147
James Gordon.

1143
01:37:30,148 --> 01:37:36,101
'The Batman didn't murdered Harvey
Dent, he saved my boy.'

1144
01:37:36,102 --> 01:37:40,104
'Then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes,'

1145
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:43,285
'So that I could threw my shame,'

1146
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:50,282
'build a lie around this
fallen idol.'

1147
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:57,390
'I praised the mad man who
tried to kill my own child,'

1148
01:37:57,391 --> 01:38:01,358
'But I can no longer live
with my lie.'

1149
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:05,524
'It's time to trust The people
of Gotham with the truth'

1150
01:38:05,525 --> 01:38:09,979
'And it is time for me to resign.'

1151
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:14,104
And do you accept this
man resignation?

1152
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:20,312
And do you accept the
resignations of all these liars,

1153
01:38:20,313 --> 01:38:22,118
of all the corrupt?

1154
01:38:25,436 --> 01:38:29,029
Those men locked up for 8
years at Blackgate with

1155
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:32,478
denied parole under the
Dent's act based on a lie?

1156
01:38:32,481 --> 01:38:35,041
Gotham needed a hero.

1157
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:39,215
It needs it now more than ever.
You betrayed everything you stood for.

1158
01:38:40,878 --> 01:38:42,847
What's the point?

1159
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:47,789
Far out there when the
structures failing,

1160
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:51,263
and on the road, weapons
city more than shackles

1161
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:54,126
and letting the bad guy getting hit.

1162
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,308
One day, you may face
such a moment of crisis

1163
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:04,740
and in that moment I hope
you have a friend like I did!

1164
01:39:04,741 --> 01:39:10,933
To plunge their hands into the filth
so that you can keep yours clean.

1165
01:39:10,934 --> 01:39:15,299
Your hands looks pretty filthy
to me, Commissioner.

1166
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:20,178
We take Gotham from the corrupt.

1167
01:39:21,726 --> 01:39:23,304
The rich.

1168
01:39:23,305 --> 01:39:29,946
The oppressors who for generation has
get you down with myth of opportunity,

1169
01:39:29,947 --> 01:39:35,837
and we give it back to
you, the people.

1170
01:39:37,029 --> 01:39:41,068
Gotham is yours.
None shall interfered.

1171
01:39:41,069 --> 01:39:43,577
Do as you pleased.

1172
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:49,864
and start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1173
01:39:58,217 --> 01:40:01,378
Step forward those who would serve.

1174
01:40:02,962 --> 01:40:06,484
To an army, a world will be raised.

1175
01:40:08,827 --> 01:40:13,632
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent years...

1176
01:40:17,628 --> 01:40:23,752
and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure.

1177
01:40:28,114 --> 01:40:32,156
Courts will be convened.

1178
01:40:37,797 --> 01:40:41,762
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1179
01:40:45,084 --> 01:40:48,250
Blood will be shed.

1180
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:53,166
The Police will survive

1181
01:40:53,266 --> 01:40:57,858
as they learn to serve
true justice ...

1182
01:40:57,859 --> 01:41:01,747
This great city ...

1183
01:41:02,996 --> 01:41:06,330
it will endure ...!

1184
01:41:07,333 --> 01:41:11,396
Gotham will survive!

1185
01:41:32,407 --> 01:41:35,624
He says you must first
fix your back.

1186
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:36,933
How does he know?

1187
01:41:36,934 --> 01:41:40,333
He was the prison doctor.
A morphine addict.

1188
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:44,385
When heard of this pleasure
of powerful evil,

1189
01:41:44,386 --> 01:41:47,385
including your mask friend.

1190
01:41:47,386 --> 01:41:48,825
How?

1191
01:41:49,973 --> 01:41:55,397
Many years ago,
it was a time of plague.

1192
01:41:55,432 --> 01:42:00,076
Some of the other
prisoners attacked Bane.

1193
01:42:00,874 --> 01:42:04,069
The Doctor humbling attempt
to rebuild the damage,

1194
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:07,264
left him in perpetual agony.

1195
01:42:07,265 --> 01:42:10,658
The Mask hold the pain at bay.

1196
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:16,262
Bane was the child who struck out?
He was born here?

1197
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:21,075
Legend is that it was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1198
01:42:21,076 --> 01:42:24,441
They felt in love with the
warlord's daughter.

1199
01:42:24,442 --> 01:42:28,507
They were married in secret,
but the warlord found out.

1200
01:42:28,508 --> 01:42:33,126
The mercenary was
condemned to this pit.

1201
01:42:33,127 --> 01:42:35,049
But then he exiled him instead.

1202
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:39,514
The mess I understood that it was the
daughter who secure his release.

1203
01:42:39,515 --> 01:42:45,428
But what he could not know,
was the true price of his freedom.

1204
01:42:45,429 --> 01:42:49,184
She took his place in the pit.

1205
01:42:50,423 --> 01:42:55,106
And she was with child,
the mercenary child.

1206
01:42:56,401 --> 01:43:00,918
Innocence cannot flower underground,
it has to be stem out ...

1207
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:08,700
One day, the doctor
forgot to lock the cell.

1208
01:43:15,059 --> 01:43:19,245
But the child had a friend,
a protector.

1209
01:43:19,246 --> 01:43:23,858
Who showed the others that this
innocence was their redemption.

1210
01:43:23,859 --> 01:43:25,469
It was to be priced.

1211
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,695
The mother was not so lucky.

1212
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:34,966
This is Bane's prison now.
It wouldn't want this story told.

1213
01:43:45,436 --> 01:43:49,487
There's a vertebra
protruding from your back.

1214
01:43:49,488 --> 01:43:52,062
It has to be put back.

1215
01:43:56,778 --> 01:44:00,424
Stay like this until you stand.

1216
01:44:08,662 --> 01:44:11,966
Did you not think I would
return, Bruce?

1217
01:44:17,984 --> 01:44:20,731
I told you I was immortal.

1218
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:24,188
I watched you die!

1219
01:44:24,189 --> 01:44:28,434
Oh they're many forms of immortality.

1220
01:44:29,414 --> 01:44:33,646
Once I had a wife. My great love.

1221
01:44:35,362 --> 01:44:37,879
She was taken from me.

1222
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,770
You were the mercenary.

1223
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:47,593
Bane is your child, your heir.

1224
01:44:47,628 --> 01:44:50,413
I'm here to ensure
The League of Shadow

1225
01:44:50,414 --> 01:44:54,312
fulfills it's duty to restore
balance to civilization.

1226
01:44:54,347 --> 01:44:58,141
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years

1227
01:44:58,142 --> 01:45:02,480
with all your strength,
all your resources,

1228
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:05,142
all your moral authority.

1229
01:45:05,306 --> 01:45:09,181
and the only victory you
achieved was a lie.

1230
01:45:09,182 --> 01:45:12,360
Now, you understand?
Gotham is beyond saving

1231
01:45:12,361 --> 01:45:15,296
and must be allowed to die.

1232
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:33,418
No!

1233
01:46:08,564 --> 01:46:10,792
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1234
01:46:10,793 --> 01:46:14,214
Now, it's everyone's home.

1235
01:46:14,215 --> 01:46:18,404
There's storm coming remember?
That is what we wanted.

1236
01:46:46,624 --> 01:46:49,474
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

1237
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:53,230
- Any news from the Commissioner?
- The less you know father..

1238
01:46:53,265 --> 01:46:54,818
How are the boys doing?

1239
01:46:54,853 --> 01:46:58,210
Well we had more power on,
so they get some TV.

1240
01:46:58,211 --> 01:47:01,720
- It's good to see you father.
- Blake, you be careful out there.

1241
01:47:01,721 --> 01:47:04,682
They hunting down cops like dogs.

1242
01:47:09,591 --> 01:47:14,798
- Why build yourself?
- I'm not meant to die in here.

1243
01:47:14,833 --> 01:47:19,612
Here or there, what's the difference?

1244
01:48:20,016 --> 01:48:23,438
I told you it can not be done.

1245
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:26,289
You told me a child did it.

1246
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:32,456
But no ordinary child,
a child born in hell,

1247
01:48:36,173 --> 01:48:38,689
forged from suffering,

1248
01:48:39,671 --> 01:48:42,958
harden by pain.

1249
01:48:42,959 --> 01:48:47,185
Not a man from privileged.

1250
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,169
We got blues in the ground sir.

1251
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:10,029
Just waiting on intel.

1252
01:49:14,716 --> 01:49:17,593
- Do you have ID?
- Of course not.

1253
01:49:17,594 --> 01:49:21,203
- How can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1254
01:49:21,204 --> 01:49:23,517
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1255
01:49:23,518 --> 01:49:26,477
- Captain, glad to have you here.
- It's our job sir.

1256
01:49:26,478 --> 01:49:28,514
Now how many are
all you are they?

1257
01:49:28,515 --> 01:49:31,189
Well there's dozen, I
rather not say exactly.

1258
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:34,495
The man trapped underground,
numbered almost 3,000.

1259
01:49:34,496 --> 01:49:36,550
- What kind of condition are they in?
- They been getting in food and water.

1260
01:49:36,551 --> 01:49:38,398
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:41,637
Take out the mercenaries guarding the
outflows south of Ackerman Park,

1262
01:49:41,638 --> 01:49:44,543
blow the rubble, we can make a
hole big enough for 10 at a time.

1263
01:49:44,544 --> 01:49:46,428
I'm in contact with my
partner down there.

1264
01:49:46,429 --> 01:49:47,917
They're just waiting
for the day.

1265
01:49:47,918 --> 01:49:49,617
Commander, they haven't seen
daylight for three months.

1266
01:49:49,618 --> 01:49:52,176
Police officers who haven't seen
daylight in three months.

1267
01:49:52,177 --> 01:49:53,073
What about the bomb?

1268
01:49:53,074 --> 01:49:55,494
The satellite can't pick up
any radiation hot spots.

1269
01:49:55,495 --> 01:49:59,019
They keep it on a truck.
It must have lead lined roof.

1270
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:01,981
- They're moving constantly.
- Good, so you know the truck?

1271
01:50:01,982 --> 01:50:05,435
Well it's one of the three.
We've been tracking it.

1272
01:50:05,761 --> 01:50:07,259
Decoy.

1273
01:50:08,274 --> 01:50:10,243
You're not really think
he's coming back, do you?

1274
01:50:10,244 --> 01:50:11,385
Doesn't matter what I think.

1275
01:50:11,386 --> 01:50:15,604
Actually it does. You should put
your faith in something more real.

1276
01:50:15,605 --> 01:50:17,849
But the routes don't vary much.

1277
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:21,282
- What about the trigger man?
- No leads. It's a bluff.

1278
01:50:21,283 --> 01:50:23,843
Bane wouldn't gave control
on that to someone else.

1279
01:50:23,844 --> 01:50:25,172
We can't take that chance.

1280
01:50:25,207 --> 01:50:27,769
Until we have the trigger
man, we just track the device.

1281
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:30,564
And mean while, Gotham
lives under a warlord?

1282
01:50:30,565 --> 01:50:31,944
Like some failed state?

1283
01:50:31,945 --> 01:50:34,958
Dialed it back, officer.
The situation is unprecedented.

1284
01:50:34,959 --> 01:50:37,018
We can't do anything
to risk million of lives.

1285
01:50:37,019 --> 01:50:40,402
Can't you tell? Aren't you going to
tell them what actually is going on?

1286
01:50:40,403 --> 01:50:43,927
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1287
01:50:43,928 --> 01:50:46,009
There's someone you need to meet.

1288
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:48,441
Came up stairs looking
for a vantage point.

1289
01:50:48,442 --> 01:50:50,837
Found the people who runs the
corporation living up here.

1290
01:50:50,838 --> 01:50:51,580
What corporation?

1291
01:50:51,581 --> 01:50:53,513
Wayne Enterprises.

1292
01:51:03,188 --> 01:51:05,380
Mr. Fox would you like
to brief the captain?

1293
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:08,176
Mrs. Tate is fully aware
of the situation.

1294
01:51:08,177 --> 01:51:12,717
As the CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1295
01:51:12,718 --> 01:51:14,943
- Why?
- We built it.

1296
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:16,456
You built the bomb?

1297
01:51:16,457 --> 01:51:20,832
It was build as a fussion reactor.
First of it's kind

1298
01:51:20,867 --> 01:51:24,509
Bane turned the core into a bomb,
and remove it from the reactor.

1299
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:25,726
That's the important part.

1300
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:28,120
As the device's fuel
cells deteriorates,

1301
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:31,911
it becomes increasingly unstable
to the point of detonation.

1302
01:51:31,912 --> 01:51:36,111
- This bomb is a time bomb.
- And it will go off in 23 days.

1303
01:51:36,112 --> 01:51:38,803
Regardless of the Bane's
revolution or what we

1304
01:51:38,804 --> 01:51:40,922
and the outside
world choose to do.

1305
01:51:40,923 --> 01:51:43,879
Your peace-man plan may not be
as practical as you thought.

1306
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,008
Could you disarm it?

1307
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:48,256
I could reconnect to the
reactor to stabilize it.

1308
01:51:48,257 --> 01:51:50,536
Let's move away from this
location and call it in.

1309
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:51,340
Alright let's go!

1310
01:51:51,341 --> 01:51:54,961
Let me take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1311
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:03,773
Someone sold us out.

1312
01:52:27,778 --> 01:52:30,346
I'd die before I talk.

1313
01:52:30,347 --> 01:52:34,244
How about new schedule, Captain.

1314
01:52:39,554 --> 01:52:44,506
- There were people living upstairs.
- Round them up for judgment.

1315
01:52:48,315 --> 01:52:53,250
And hang them where the world to see.

1316
01:53:07,934 --> 01:53:12,436
He says that the leap of
freedom is not about strength.

1317
01:53:12,437 --> 01:53:16,664
- My body makes the jump.
- Surviving is spirit.

1318
01:53:21,531 --> 01:53:24,700
My soul, is it ready to
escape with my body?

1319
01:53:24,701 --> 01:53:27,675
Feel is why you afraid?

1320
01:53:27,676 --> 01:53:30,194
No, I'm not afraid.

1321
01:53:31,167 --> 01:53:33,341
I'm angry.

1322
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:02,764
Bruce ...

1323
01:54:04,494 --> 01:54:06,788
Why did we fall?

1324
01:54:11,797 --> 01:54:18,797
You do not fear death. You think this
makes you strong? It makes you weak.

1325
01:54:19,752 --> 01:54:21,144
Why?

1326
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:23,661
How can you move faster than possible?

1327
01:54:23,662 --> 01:54:26,177
Fight longer than possible?

1328
01:54:26,178 --> 01:54:30,541
Without the most powerful
impulse left in you.

1329
01:54:30,542 --> 01:54:33,394
The fear of death.

1330
01:54:33,395 --> 01:54:36,506
I fear death.

1331
01:54:36,507 --> 01:54:41,579
I fear dying in here,
all my city burns,

1332
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:45,257
there's no one there to save it.

1333
01:54:46,121 --> 01:54:48,718
And then make the climb!

1334
01:54:52,922 --> 01:54:54,628
How?

1335
01:54:55,541 --> 01:54:58,432
As the child did.

1336
01:55:01,882 --> 01:55:05,851
Without the rope.

1337
01:55:05,852 --> 01:55:09,742
That fear will fight you again.

1338
01:55:15,442 --> 01:55:19,859
Ah surprise for your journey,
that's wonderful.

1339
01:55:24,883 --> 01:55:28,384
- What does that mean?
- Rise.

1340
01:55:29,516 --> 01:55:30,985
No.

1341
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:04,736
There's been a mistake.
Take me to Bane!

1342
01:57:07,096 --> 01:57:09,018
Where's Bane?

1343
01:57:14,809 --> 01:57:16,078
Where's Bane?

1344
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:20,898
There's no mistake Mr. Stryver.
You are Philip Stryver.

1345
01:57:20,899 --> 01:57:24,799
Executive Vice President of
Daggett Industries?

1346
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,769
Who for years has been
living off the blood

1347
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:30,805
and sweat of people
less powerful than him!

1348
01:57:30,806 --> 01:57:34,384
Call Bane!
I am one of you.

1349
01:57:34,385 --> 01:57:38,438
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1350
01:57:38,439 --> 01:57:43,130
Now chooses are yours: exile or death?

1351
01:57:49,372 --> 01:57:52,662
- Exile.
- Sold!

1352
01:57:52,663 --> 01:57:55,414
The man of the cold sweat.

1353
01:58:02,121 --> 01:58:06,248
You follow the thick ice. If you
try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1354
01:58:06,249 --> 01:58:08,049
So no one made it?

1355
01:58:21,464 --> 01:58:22,409
Where the hell are they?

1356
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:24,102
It's not like we have
a lot of time here.

1357
01:58:24,103 --> 01:58:27,134
- How long?
- The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1358
01:58:27,135 --> 01:58:29,456
We have about 18 hours
to do something.

1359
01:58:29,457 --> 01:58:30,152
To do what?

1360
01:58:30,153 --> 01:58:32,023
To mark the truck.
Get a GPS on it,

1361
01:58:32,024 --> 01:58:34,723
so we can start to figure
out how to bring it down.

1362
01:58:41,248 --> 01:58:42,936
That's it?

1363
01:58:45,034 --> 01:58:47,154
Foley!

1364
01:58:47,648 --> 01:58:50,340
Where is Foley? Damn it!

1365
01:58:50,341 --> 01:58:52,907
You shouldn't be out in the streets.

1366
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:57,449
Jim, he's not here.

1367
01:58:57,450 --> 01:59:02,482
You let your wife come to the door,
when the city is under occupation?

1368
01:59:02,517 --> 01:59:05,874
What did you do? Bury your
uniform in the backyard?

1369
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:08,021
You saw what they
did to the special forces.

1370
01:59:08,022 --> 01:59:10,272
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrolled?

1371
01:59:10,273 --> 01:59:13,064
When every gang banger want to plant
one as soon as our back are turned?

1372
01:59:13,065 --> 01:59:15,582
Now is different and you know it.
This guys run the city.

1373
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:17,448
The government is done
a deal with them.

1374
01:59:17,449 --> 01:59:20,391
Bane's got their balls on
the ice that's not a deal.

1375
01:59:20,392 --> 01:59:23,597
If you move on Bane, the trigger-man
is going to hit the button.

1376
01:59:23,598 --> 01:59:27,965
Do you think he's given control
of that bomb to one of the people?

1377
01:59:27,966 --> 01:59:30,574
You think this apart
of some revolutions?

1378
01:59:30,575 --> 01:59:33,183
There's only one man with his
finger on the button, that's Bane.

1379
01:59:33,184 --> 01:59:36,360
Look we all got to keep our heads
down until they can fix this.

1380
01:59:36,361 --> 01:59:38,485
If you had family here ...

1381
01:59:38,486 --> 01:59:41,835
It's only get fix
from inside the city.

1382
01:59:41,991 --> 01:59:48,182
Look Peter, I'm not asking you to
walk down grand in you dress rules,

1383
01:59:48,182 --> 01:59:49,288
but something has to be done.

1384
01:59:49,389 --> 01:59:51,473
- I'm sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down..

1385
01:59:51,474 --> 01:59:54,315
What's good that going to do
tomorrow when that thing blows.

1386
01:59:54,316 --> 01:59:57,196
You don't know that's
going to happens.

1387
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:03,276
I hear you're looking
for men Commissioner?

1388
02:00:03,277 --> 02:00:04,549
How about me instead?

1389
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:09,728
- Miss Tate, I can't ask do do that.
- Please.

1390
02:00:12,387 --> 02:00:14,387
- What you did?
- Nothing.

1391
02:00:14,412 --> 02:00:15,743
I didn't take anything.

1392
02:00:15,744 --> 02:00:18,508
You steal from us? You little bastard.

1393
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:21,838
Now you boys know you
can't come in my

1394
02:00:21,839 --> 02:00:23,838
neighborhood without
asking politely.

1395
02:00:29,328 --> 02:00:33,550
Never steal anything from
someone you can't outrun, kid!

1396
02:00:38,862 --> 02:00:42,574
You're pretty generous for a thief!

1397
02:00:49,888 --> 02:00:52,858
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1398
02:00:52,859 --> 02:00:57,284
- If you expecting an apology ...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1399
02:00:57,285 --> 02:00:58,881
I need your help.

1400
02:00:58,882 --> 02:01:02,964
- And why would I help you?
- For this. ' Clean Slate'.

1401
02:01:02,965 --> 02:01:07,411
You trust me with that,
after what I did to you?

1402
02:01:07,412 --> 02:01:10,489
I admit I was a little let down.

1403
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:13,717
But I still think
there more to you.

1404
02:01:13,718 --> 02:01:16,800
In fact that, I think that.
For you, this isn't just a tool.

1405
02:01:16,801 --> 02:01:21,023
It's an escape route you want
to disappear, start fresh.

1406
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:22,849
I couldn't even get
off this island.

1407
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:25,858
I could give you a way off once
you to get me to Lucius Fox.

1408
02:01:25,859 --> 02:01:29,821
I need you to find out where they're
holding him and take me in.

1409
02:01:32,365 --> 02:01:34,832
- Why do you need Fox?
- To save the city.

1410
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:38,205
Who says it needs saving?
Maybe I like it this way.

1411
02:01:38,206 --> 02:01:40,886
Maybe you do.

1412
02:01:40,887 --> 02:01:44,292
But tomorrow that bomb is going off.

1413
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:49,094
Get your powerful
friend on the case?

1414
02:01:49,095 --> 02:01:51,455
I'm trying, but I need Fox.

1415
02:01:51,521 --> 02:01:55,667
Once it approaches, flick the switch.

1416
02:01:55,668 --> 02:01:58,239
The needle hit 200, you
give me the signal.

1417
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,934
I'll will mark truck. Okay?

1418
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:02,302
Heads up! Heads up!

1419
02:02:18,096 --> 02:02:20,602
- I got it!
- Mercenaries at your 6.

1420
02:02:20,903 --> 02:02:24,444
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1421
02:02:26,074 --> 02:02:28,825
Commissioner Gordon,
you're under arrest.

1422
02:02:28,826 --> 02:02:30,135
On who's authority?

1423
02:02:30,136 --> 02:02:32,333
People of Gotham.

1424
02:02:32,334 --> 02:02:37,436
No lawyer. No witnesses.
What sort of due process is this?

1425
02:02:37,437 --> 02:02:41,144
You guilt have been determined.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1426
02:02:41,145 --> 02:02:43,584
Now what will it be?

1427
02:02:43,585 --> 02:02:46,546
Death or exile?

1428
02:02:46,647 --> 02:02:51,730
Crane, if you think we're going
out on that ice willingly,

1429
02:02:51,731 --> 02:02:54,415
you have another thing coming.

1430
02:02:55,694 --> 02:02:58,564
- Death then.
- Looks that way.

1431
02:02:58,565 --> 02:03:02,000
Very well. Death!

1432
02:03:02,601 --> 02:03:05,065
By exile.

1433
02:03:06,793 --> 02:03:09,260
Bring her to me!

1434
02:03:15,392 --> 02:03:17,392
Hey. Going down. Get things ready.

1435
02:03:17,417 --> 02:03:19,417
Let's gear on.

1436
02:03:26,591 --> 02:03:28,598
Spot this one on the spot.
Got a big day tomorrow.

1437
02:03:28,695 --> 02:03:31,491
We all do. Not every day
you bag Bruce Wayne!

1438
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:35,802
- Bruce?
- You okay?

1439
02:03:35,803 --> 02:03:38,208
You pick the hell of time to
go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1440
02:03:38,209 --> 02:03:40,003
How long until that core ignites?

1441
02:03:40,004 --> 02:03:41,884
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1442
02:03:41,885 --> 02:03:44,553
Unless we can reconnect
it to the reactor.

1443
02:03:44,554 --> 02:03:48,324
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1444
02:03:48,325 --> 02:03:51,159
- Do what necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1445
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:53,437
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1446
02:03:53,438 --> 02:03:58,496
Sorry to spoil things boys but
they want these guys to themselves.

1447
02:03:59,966 --> 02:04:03,120
- I won't forget about us, Miranda!
- I know.

1448
02:04:12,074 --> 02:04:15,688
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne!
- He should be so lucky.

1449
02:04:21,968 --> 02:04:26,830
Any move I make on Bane or the
bomb, the trigger-man will set it off.

1450
02:04:26,831 --> 02:04:29,887
They won’t use radio or
cell, too much interference.

1451
02:04:29,888 --> 02:04:31,698
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1452
02:04:31,699 --> 02:04:34,582
It had to be a Micro-burst,
long-range.

1453
02:04:34,583 --> 02:04:36,407
- Can you block it?
- Yes.

1454
02:04:36,408 --> 02:04:40,580
But I need the EMP cannon
guidance mounted on the Bat.

1455
02:04:40,581 --> 02:04:43,113
Remember where you parked it?

1456
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:00,560
- It fly okay?
- Yeah.

1457
02:05:00,995 --> 02:05:03,503
Even without the autopilot.
Thanks.

1458
02:05:03,504 --> 02:05:06,219
Autopilot?
That's what you're there for.

1459
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:48,079
Thing's clear. Come on, quick! Climb.

1460
02:05:58,226 --> 02:05:59,743
Lock it up!

1461
02:06:04,168 --> 02:06:05,948
Who are you?

1462
02:06:34,754 --> 02:06:36,802
Light it up!

1463
02:06:53,918 --> 02:06:55,918
Mom check it out.

1464
02:06:56,182 --> 02:06:58,058
Honey, take a look!

1465
02:07:07,188 --> 02:07:09,450
Impossible!

1466
02:07:10,299 --> 02:07:14,476
Keep her close!
He'll come for her.

1467
02:07:14,477 --> 02:07:18,554
- Where's Miranda Tate?
- Bane took her.

1468
02:07:18,555 --> 02:07:22,033
He holds up city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1469
02:07:22,034 --> 02:07:24,503
This blocks detonator
signal to the bomb.

1470
02:07:24,504 --> 02:07:26,972
Get it on to it before sunrise.

1471
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:29,352
If I hit the button when starts.

1472
02:07:29,353 --> 02:07:32,225
- When what start?
- War.

1473
02:08:08,336 --> 02:08:09,496
You missed a spot.

1474
02:08:12,630 --> 02:08:15,805
If you're working alone,
wear a mask!

1475
02:08:15,806 --> 02:08:18,122
I'm not afraid if they see me
standing up to these guys.

1476
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:21,929
The mask is not for you, it's to
protect the people you care about.

1477
02:08:22,754 --> 02:08:25,614
Count to five and throw.

1478
02:08:35,564 --> 02:08:38,466
Hey no offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1479
02:08:48,266 --> 02:08:51,182
- What now?
- All out assault on Bane.

1480
02:08:51,183 --> 02:08:54,000
But you need to get
people across the bridge.

1481
02:08:54,001 --> 02:08:54,704
Why?

1482
02:08:54,705 --> 02:08:59,343
In case we fail. Leave an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1483
02:08:59,344 --> 02:09:03,892
- You don't need me here?
- You given me an army. Now, go!

1484
02:09:04,193 --> 02:09:07,038
- Alright, thanks!
- Don't thank me yet.

1485
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:10,328
Well I might not get the chance later.

1486
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,407
You shouldn't have.

1487
02:09:25,613 --> 02:09:28,042
All in town tunnel blocked by debris.

1488
02:09:28,043 --> 02:09:31,369
But the cannon have anough fire
power to make a path for people.

1489
02:09:31,370 --> 02:09:33,158
Wait until the fighting begins!

1490
02:09:33,159 --> 02:09:36,449
You going to wage your war
to save your stuck up girlfriend?

1491
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:38,803
To start it, throttle.

1492
02:09:38,804 --> 02:09:40,036
I got it.

1493
02:09:40,037 --> 02:09:42,455
We have 45 minutes to save the city.

1494
02:09:42,456 --> 02:09:46,050
No. I got 45 minutes to get
clear of the blast radius.

1495
02:09:46,085 --> 02:09:47,456
because you don't stand
a chance against these guys.

1496
02:09:47,457 --> 02:09:48,918
With your help, I might.

1497
02:09:48,919 --> 02:09:51,826
I open that tunnel,
but then I'm gone.

1498
02:09:51,827 --> 02:09:55,372
There's more to you than that.

1499
02:09:57,517 --> 02:10:00,809
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1500
02:10:03,225 --> 02:10:08,488
Come with me! Save yourself!

1501
02:10:09,871 --> 02:10:15,113
You don't owe these people anymore.
You given them everything.

1502
02:10:15,114 --> 02:10:18,955
Not everything. Not yet.

1503
02:10:58,495 --> 02:11:02,951
Disperse! Disperse or be fired upon!

1504
02:11:03,783 --> 02:11:06,721
There's only one police in this town,

1505
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:47,085
Open fire!

1506
02:12:38,083 --> 02:12:40,158
- Here it comes.
- Get ready!

1507
02:13:09,527 --> 02:13:14,110
So you came back to die
with your city!

1508
02:13:14,111 --> 02:13:18,135
No. I came back to stop you.

1509
02:13:29,155 --> 02:13:30,261
Now!

1510
02:13:43,207 --> 02:13:44,286
That's impossible.

1511
02:13:46,124 --> 02:13:48,084
Come over the fifth!

1512
02:14:02,732 --> 02:14:06,685
Get on the bus, go ahead.
You come with me! You too!

1513
02:14:06,686 --> 02:14:10,071
Hey you, you and you, come here!

1514
02:14:10,072 --> 02:14:12,016
Everyone else get on the bus! Okay.

1515
02:14:12,017 --> 02:14:15,036
You guys, you're going to knock
on doors and spread the word okay.

1516
02:14:15,037 --> 02:14:18,172
The bomb going to go off.
Get out by South Street tunnel.

1517
02:14:18,207 --> 02:14:19,299
or over the bridge.

1518
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:23,549
You go, you do two blocks, you get
back to the bus. Alright? Go! Go!

1519
02:14:24,345 --> 02:14:28,521
- Is he back?
- Keep your eyes open. Go!

1520
02:15:50,563 --> 02:15:52,753
Cover the doors!

1521
02:15:55,487 --> 02:15:58,617
Where's your trigger? Where is it?

1522
02:15:59,727 --> 02:16:03,107
You never gave it to
any ordinary citizen.

1523
02:16:03,108 --> 02:16:05,719
Where is it?
Where's the trigger?

1524
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:08,791
Where is it?

1525
02:16:17,047 --> 02:16:20,543
Tell me where the trigger is.

1526
02:16:20,544 --> 02:16:23,401
Then, you have my permission to die.

1527
02:16:35,363 --> 02:16:40,459
I broke you.
How did you come back?

1528
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:44,815
You think you're the only one who
could learn the strength to escape?

1529
02:16:44,816 --> 02:16:49,485
- Where's the trigger?
- But I never escaped.

1530
02:16:50,256 --> 02:16:52,655
But the child,

1531
02:16:53,556 --> 02:16:56,180
Child of Ra's Al Ghul's,
who made the climb.

1532
02:16:56,181 --> 02:16:59,443
But he's not the child
of Ra's Al Ghul.

1533
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:04,023
I am.

1534
02:17:04,024 --> 02:17:09,830
Although I'm not ordinary,
I'm a citizen.

1535
02:17:29,017 --> 02:17:30,546
Miranda?

1536
02:17:32,956 --> 02:17:34,312
Why?

1537
02:17:34,613 --> 02:17:40,289
Thalia. My mother named me
Thalia before she was killed.

1538
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:46,237
The way I have been killed
if not for my protector, Bane.

1539
02:17:53,918 --> 02:17:55,031
Good bye.

1540
02:17:57,150 --> 02:18:00,148
I climbed out of the pit.

1541
02:18:05,164 --> 02:18:07,718
I found my father

1542
02:18:09,844 --> 02:18:13,745
and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1543
02:18:13,746 --> 02:18:15,790
But by that time,

1544
02:18:15,890 --> 02:18:20,891
the prisoners and the doctor
had their work to my friend,

1545
02:18:20,892 --> 02:18:22,184
my protector.

1546
02:18:25,956 --> 02:18:32,887
The League took us in and trained us
but my father could not accept Bane.

1547
02:18:32,888 --> 02:18:36,943
He saw only a monster,
whose very existence

1548
02:18:36,944 --> 02:18:41,119
was the reminder of the hell
he left his wife to die in.

1549
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,503
He excommunicated Bane from
The League of Shadows.

1550
02:18:44,504 --> 02:18:49,814
His only crime was
that he loved me.

1551
02:18:51,023 --> 02:18:54,723
I could not forgive my father.

1552
02:18:58,371 --> 02:19:00,935
Until you murdered him.

1553
02:19:17,958 --> 02:19:23,419
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

1554
02:19:23,454 --> 02:19:28,584
Innocence is a strong word
to throw around Gotham roose.

1555
02:19:29,973 --> 02:19:33,726
I honor my father by
finishing his work.

1556
02:19:45,073 --> 02:19:47,782
Vengeance against
the man who killed

1557
02:19:47,783 --> 02:19:50,784
him is simply a reward
for my patience.

1558
02:19:51,802 --> 02:19:53,085
You see?

1559
02:19:54,033 --> 02:19:59,105
It's the slow knife.
The knife that takes it's time.

1560
02:20:02,137 --> 02:20:07,769
The knife that wait years,
without forgetting,

1561
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:12,264
then slip quietly
between the bones,

1562
02:20:12,265 --> 02:20:16,778
that's the knife that cut deepest.

1563
02:20:16,844 --> 02:20:18,597
Please!

1564
02:20:25,463 --> 02:20:29,393
Maybe that knife was too slow.

1565
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:31,496
The truck is under attacked.

1566
02:20:31,497 --> 02:20:34,930
Gordon. You gave him a
way to block my signal

1567
02:20:35,231 --> 02:20:37,221
No matter.

1568
02:20:39,027 --> 02:20:42,071
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1569
02:20:45,794 --> 02:20:47,794
Come on!

1570
02:20:54,799 --> 02:20:56,819
Stay back! What are you doing?

1571
02:20:56,820 --> 02:21:00,390
Blake. MCU, I'm getting
these boys to safety

1572
02:21:00,391 --> 02:21:02,350
You're going to get
us all killed.

1573
02:21:02,351 --> 02:21:05,485
If anyone cross this bridge,
they'll blow up the city.

1574
02:21:05,486 --> 02:21:08,679
It going to blow up anyway.
We need to open this bridge, now!

1575
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:12,452
Detective, if you take one step
forward we will shoot you!

1576
02:21:12,453 --> 02:21:16,225
If you do two forward,
we will blow the bridge.

1577
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:21,743
Go back to the bus and wait
for me alright! Just go back and wait.

1578
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:26,264
They've prepared a convoy.

1579
02:21:26,265 --> 02:21:28,959
We must secure the bomb
until it detonates!

1580
02:21:29,829 --> 02:21:35,303
Don't kill him. I want him
to feel the heat.

1581
02:21:35,338 --> 02:21:38,168
Heat the fire of 12 million souls.

1582
02:21:38,203 --> 02:21:39,511
You failed!

1583
02:21:45,116 --> 02:21:47,687
Good bye, my friend!

1584
02:21:56,863 --> 02:22:00,265
Keep moving forward!
Take back the stairs!

1585
02:22:08,567 --> 02:22:09,920
Shoot them!

1586
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:12,711
Shoot them all!

1587
02:22:21,758 --> 02:22:25,543
We both know that I
have to kill you now.

1588
02:22:28,053 --> 02:22:30,928
You have just to imagine the fire.

1589
02:22:38,309 --> 02:22:40,682
About the whole no guns thing,

1590
02:22:40,683 --> 02:22:44,714
I'm not sure I feel strongly
about it as you do.

1591
02:22:57,569 --> 02:22:58,771
Pull up!

1592
02:23:02,027 --> 02:23:03,683
Stay level.

1593
02:23:15,967 --> 02:23:19,523
We have to force them to
the entrance of the reactor.

1594
02:23:20,858 --> 02:23:24,126
I need you on the ground.
I'll be leaving. Go!

1595
02:23:24,127 --> 02:23:28,081
The situation has changed!
Your orders are out of date.

1596
02:23:28,082 --> 02:23:32,185
I'm a cop like you and
I'm walking out there.

1597
02:23:32,186 --> 02:23:35,566
Please do not shoot me!

1598
02:23:36,679 --> 02:23:38,181
Shoot at his knee.

1599
02:23:47,629 --> 02:23:50,123
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1600
02:23:50,124 --> 02:23:55,568
Detective, please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!

1601
02:23:55,569 --> 02:24:01,419
Stop walking! Blow it! Do it!

1602
02:24:12,924 --> 02:24:16,427
They have to get that bomb here
and you got ten minutes.

1603
02:24:26,075 --> 02:24:28,900
They're pushing us to the
entrance of the reactor!

1604
02:24:28,901 --> 02:24:31,338
They're going to try
to reconnect the core.

1605
02:24:31,363 --> 02:24:33,363
Idiots!

1606
02:24:34,129 --> 02:24:39,901
You son-of-bitches! You killed them.
You're just following orders!

1607
02:24:40,298 --> 02:24:42,477
Alright boys get in circle,
bow your heads.

1608
02:24:44,688 --> 02:24:46,349
Not much longer.

1609
02:25:35,044 --> 02:25:37,462
Let's get everyone back in the bus.
Okay?

1610
02:25:37,463 --> 02:25:38,995
Go! Go! Back in the bus.

1611
02:25:38,996 --> 02:25:41,934
There's no where to go!

1612
02:25:41,935 --> 02:25:43,763
On the bus!

1613
02:26:39,663 --> 02:26:43,074
You got to the truck EAST!

1614
02:26:46,796 --> 02:26:48,283
Stay straight!

1615
02:27:20,339 --> 02:27:23,654
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1616
02:27:30,412 --> 02:27:34,503
Fox showed me how overwrite reactor.

1617
02:27:36,957 --> 02:27:38,586
Oh dear.

1618
02:27:41,882 --> 02:27:45,413
Including the emergency flood.

1619
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:08,830
There's no way this
bomb will be stopped.

1620
02:28:09,058 --> 02:28:10,647
What are you doing?

1621
02:28:10,847 --> 02:28:11,783
Protect them from the blast!

1622
02:28:11,784 --> 02:28:13,186
We're going to be alright!
Double time! Go!

1623
02:28:13,187 --> 02:28:14,482
It's an atom bomb!

1624
02:28:14,483 --> 02:28:16,047
You think they need to
hear that right now?

1625
02:28:16,048 --> 02:28:17,504
You want to watch them
die without hope? Come on!

1626
02:28:18,347 --> 02:28:21,191
Prepare yourself.

1627
02:28:21,192 --> 02:28:27,291
My father's work is done.

1628
02:28:32,491 --> 02:28:35,599
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay.

1629
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:39,617
- Set it to fly over water and eject?
- No autopilot.

1630
02:28:41,579 --> 02:28:45,011
You could've gone anywhere, did
anything but you came back here.

1631
02:28:45,012 --> 02:28:49,271
- So did you.
- I guess we're both suckers.

1632
02:28:56,231 --> 02:28:59,295
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1633
02:28:59,296 --> 02:29:01,934
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1634
02:29:01,935 --> 02:29:03,250
Hero can be anyone.

1635
02:29:03,251 --> 02:29:05,994
Even a man knowing
something as simple as

1636
02:29:05,995 --> 02:29:08,873
reassuring putting a
coat around a young boy

1637
02:29:08,874 --> 02:29:12,129
shoulders to let him
the world hadn't end then.

1638
02:29:29,723 --> 02:29:31,565
Bruce Wayne?

1639
02:29:45,229 --> 02:29:47,925
Vlad, they go! You too!
Come on father.

1640
02:30:06,915 --> 02:30:09,135
Hey heads down! This is it!

1641
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:12,765
No! That's Batman!

1642
02:31:00,034 --> 02:31:01,977
That's detonation!

1643
02:31:09,069 --> 02:31:12,000
It's out over the bay,
it's clear of the city.

1644
02:31:30,741 --> 02:31:33,370
'I see a beautiful city'

1645
02:31:33,371 --> 02:31:38,763
'and the the brilliant people
rising from this abyss.'

1646
02:31:38,764 --> 02:31:43,471
'I see the lives, for which
I lay down my life.'

1647
02:31:43,472 --> 02:31:49,560
'Peaceful, useful, prosperous
and happy.'

1648
02:31:51,202 --> 02:31:55,660
'I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts'

1649
02:31:56,366 --> 02:31:59,691
'And in the hearts of
their decedents.'

1650
02:32:00,597 --> 02:32:03,016
'Generations ends.'

1651
02:32:05,188 --> 02:32:09,359
'That's the far, far better
thing that I do...'

1652
02:32:10,349 --> 02:32:12,733
'...than I had ever done.'

1653
02:32:12,734 --> 02:32:17,494
'and It's a far, far better
rest that I go to...'

1654
02:32:20,508 --> 02:32:23,331
'...than I had ever known.'

1655
02:32:40,893 --> 02:32:45,060
I'm so sorry. I failed you!

1656
02:32:46,197 --> 02:32:48,426
You trusted me ...

1657
02:32:49,333 --> 02:32:51,693
And I failed you.

1658
02:32:54,217 --> 02:32:57,247
Can't I change your mind,

1659
02:32:58,861 --> 02:33:01,470
about quitting the force?

1660
02:33:01,471 --> 02:33:05,716
You know you said about
structures becoming shackles.

1661
02:33:05,717 --> 02:33:09,591
You were right and I
can't take it, it's injustice.

1662
02:33:11,226 --> 02:33:14,132
No one ever going to know
who saved the entire city.

1663
02:33:14,133 --> 02:33:16,357
They know.

1664
02:33:17,248 --> 02:33:19,961
It was The Batman.

1665
02:33:36,879 --> 02:33:41,043
Mr. Wayne's will is not amended to
reflect his more modest estate.

1666
02:33:41,044 --> 02:33:44,035
Nonetheless, they're considerable
assets to dispose of.

1667
02:33:44,036 --> 02:33:48,067
The content of the house are to
be sold to settle the state accounts.

1668
02:33:48,068 --> 02:33:53,087
and the remainders left in it's
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1669
02:33:54,213 --> 02:33:58,322
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition

1670
02:33:58,323 --> 02:34:02,369
that they never be demolish, altered
or otherwise interfered with.

1671
02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:07,364
That they shall be used for one
purpose and one purpose only:

1672
02:34:08,296 --> 02:34:13,101
The housing and care of the city's
at risk and orphan children.

1673
02:34:13,102 --> 02:34:15,120
And I clerk and help anyone with

1674
02:34:15,121 --> 02:34:17,769
a small correspondences
and instruction.

1675
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:20,576
- Blake, John?
- Nothing here.

1676
02:34:20,601 --> 02:34:21,712
Alright,

1677
02:34:21,713 --> 02:34:23,564
Try my legal name.

1678
02:34:26,215 --> 02:34:30,083
You should use your full name.
I like that name, Robin.

1679
02:34:30,084 --> 02:34:31,306
Thanks!

1680
02:34:31,307 --> 02:34:33,046
Why are we even worrying
about stabilization software?

1681
02:34:33,047 --> 02:34:35,808
This entire autopilot system
is completely obsolete.

1682
02:34:35,809 --> 02:34:39,761
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1683
02:34:39,762 --> 02:34:43,933
But Mr. Fox it's already been fixed,
software patch, six months ago.

1684
02:34:43,934 --> 02:34:46,579
Check The ID on the patch.

1685
02:34:48,601 --> 02:34:50,687
Bruce Wayne.

1686
02:34:50,688 --> 02:34:53,609
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1687
02:34:53,610 --> 02:34:55,275
Better leave no stone unturned.

1688
02:34:55,375 --> 02:34:58,507
We can't leave a string of
pearl on the manifest flaws.
