1
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,924
You're gonna burn them.

2
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,638
You gonna go shopping for
three hours again today?

3
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:32,031
Leave your cellphone off?

4
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,544
You think I don't know what you're doing?
You think I'm stupid?

5
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:45,546
And yet you can't make
me a simple... damn breakfast.

6
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:30,108
Vanessa! Miyuki! Wait up!

7
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,614
Sorry. I dropped my phone.

8
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:36,418
God, Allison, you're such a klutz.

9
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,529
I saw you in the cafeteria today.
Do you always eat alone?

10
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:43,529
Um, well, I had to, uh...

11
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:48,126
She's only been in Tokyo for like,
three weeks or something.

12
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:53,231
No, actually, I've been at
your school for six months.

13
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,140
Oh, you have? Huh.

14
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,481
Well, no wonder you wear
your uniform like that.

15
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:02,579
Like what?

16
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,289
Roll it up. You'd look cooler.

17
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:17,599
No, no.

18
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,793
Here.

19
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,196
Higher.

20
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,201
That's better.

21
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,314
You should show off your legs more.
They're not bad.

22
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:33,608
Thanks.

23
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,425
You know, you should eat
with us sometime.

24
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,720
Really? Oh, that'd be great!

25
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,728
Let us check our calendar
and get back to you.

26
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,032
So, where are we going, anyway?

27
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,090
What is this place?

28
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:24,490
Come on, Allison.

29
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,200
This is it.

30
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,501
Can you feel it?

31
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,406
What do you mean?

32
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:44,415
They say this is one of
the most haunted houses...

33
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,114
in all of Japan.

34
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:52,421
Yeah. And that anyone who
goes inside gets the curse.

35
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,368
Come on.

36
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:12,274
Come on.

37
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,819
This is where the girl from
the International College...

38
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:58,518
killed her boyfriend two years ago.

39
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:00,754
Really?

40
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,258
Yeah.

41
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,563
She was the one who started
the fire that killed him.

42
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:15,869
Maybe they came here to,
you know...

43
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,480
Well, maybe you should bring
Michael down here,

44
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,583
since you two are so adventurous.

45
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:23,876
Come on, let's go upstairs.

46
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,473
It's in there.

47
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,667
The way up to the attic.

48
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,679
Where she lives.

49
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:27,876
Who?

50
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,782
What are you talking about?

51
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:38,786
Kayako.
The woman who was murdered here.

52
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,088
What?

53
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,290
Yeah.

54
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,400
He killed her.

55
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,705
He snapped her neck and
drowned their son in the tub.

56
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:57,108
He was so sick
he even killed the kid's cat...

57
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,612
before he hung himself.

58
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,013
But before he offed himself,

59
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:06,121
he wrapped up his wife's body
in plastic...

60
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,222
and stuffed her in the attic.

61
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,528
No way! I'm not going in there.

62
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:28,441
You don't have to go up, just inside.

63
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,338
If you close your eyes
and count to ten...

64
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:38,551
when you open them again
you'll see her.

65
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,057
All the other girls have
been too afraid to try.

66
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,062
Only me and Miyuki
have been able to do it so far.

67
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,623
One, two, three...

68
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,520
You have to go further in.

69
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,847
You have to close your eyes
before you start counting.

70
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:48,248
One, two, three, four...

71
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,850
Hey! C'mon, you guys,
open the door!

72
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:53,757
- Sorry, Allison.
- Open the door. Please!

73
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,557
Wait, wait, I gotta take a picture.

74
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,462
C'mon, you guys! This isn't funny!
I can't open it!

75
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,092
Okay, scaredy-cat.

76
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,096
Come on out.

77
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,299
Please! Please!

78
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:11,709
You guys! Please!
Let me out! Please open the door!

79
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,414
I can't open it.

80
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,625
Okay, Allison. Very funny.

81
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,525
We're not holding the door.
You should be able to open it.

82
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,303
Please! Please!

83
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:22,705
Hi, Mom. How are you feeling?

84
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,612
What took you so long?

85
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:37,023
What's going on?

86
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,029
Your sister's in the hospital.

87
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,127
What?

88
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,138
There's been an accident.

89
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:03,581
What, in Tokyo?
What kind of accident? Is she? Is she...

90
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:08,679
There was a fire.
They think she started it.

91
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,189
What?

92
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,090
And Doug's, Doug is dead.

93
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,392
Oh, no.

94
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:28,300
I booked a flight.
It leaves early tomorrow morning.

95
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:32,813
No... No, Mom, you can't fly.
You're too sick.

96
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,917
I'm not going.
You are.

97
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,023
I... I can't.

98
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:53,328
You see, you see, that's the difference
between you and Karen.

99
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,734
She knows how to face life.

100
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:02,476
I don't care that you girls
aren't speaking. She's your sister.

101
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:08,474
Believe me, I wish there was
someone else, but there isn't.

102
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,585
Bring her back.

103
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,029
Do you speak English?

104
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,571
Uh, Im, Im looking for my sister,
Karen Davis.

105
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:06,470
- Bring someone who can speak English.
- OK.

106
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,576
Just wait

107
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,472
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

108
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:18,678
I think this is
Karen Davis' sister.

109
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,389
Sister?

110
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:27,293
- Follow me.
- OK, thanks.

111
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,590
- I'll do it.
- OK, thanks.

112
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:33,296
She's here. They'll take you to her.

113
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,801
- Thank you.
- Come here

114
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:43,106
This way.

115
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:47,509
She might be Karen's sister.

116
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,753
Karen?

117
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,759
Karen?

118
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,384
You're here.

119
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,786
You're really here.

120
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,691
Thank god, you're here.

121
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,801
What did you do?

122
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,602
You need to help me.
You need to get me out of here now!

123
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,211
Okay, whoa, slow down.
Just stop for a second.

124
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:51,903
Tell me what happened.

125
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:54,506
Did you start that fire?

126
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,215
Aubrey, you have to get me out of here.

127
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,819
Karen, okay, You're scaring me. Stop.

128
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,548
Please, listen to me.
I'm the only person that can stop her.

129
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,854
- Who? Stop who?
- I have to go back there! I have to!

130
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,661
Please. It's my only chance.

131
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,761
Karen, I'm sorry.

132
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,964
- Take her outside.
- OK.

133
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,680
Aubrey...

134
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,288
don't go in that house.

135
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,695
Is she okay?

136
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:49,501
I don't really know.

137
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,004
Look, I really need to talk to her.

138
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,104
Are you a friend of hers or something?

139
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:02,717
No. I don't know her.

140
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,412
I'm a journalist. My name's Eason.

141
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,824
I don't think she can
talk to you right now.

142
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:15,427
The doctors told me
they're going to sedate her.

143
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,927
She can't have any
visitors until tomorrow.

144
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,821
Open it.

145
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,225
Don't go there!

146
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:37,921
Excuse me. I just want to
talk to you about...

147
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,134
Wait! I just wanna talk to you about
your sister and the house that she?

148
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:26,910
- Alright.
- I can carry something else.

149
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,413
- Yeah? One more?
- Sure. No problem.

150
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,212
You sure? Alright.

151
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,321
- Can you carry this one?
- No.

152
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:36,618
- I could, actually, if you wanted me to.
- And you could. I know you could.

153
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,625
- Thanks, sweetie.
- There you go.

154
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:41,729
Alright. The kids are upstairs.

155
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,433
- I'm nervous.
- I know. It's going to be great.

156
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,125
- Yeah?
- Gonna be great. I swear.

157
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,437
C'mon, Jake.

158
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,344
- Welcome to your new home.
- Hey.

159
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,680
Okay, well, That's everything.

160
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,680
Why don't you help me take this
stuff back to the bedroom, okay?

161
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:05,081
Okay. Sally's coming to help
and I promised her pizza.

162
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,383
Pizza! Pizza Alright.

163
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,590
Hey.

164
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,798
Jake, come here, please.

165
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,898
I want you to get some of
this stuff out of the closet, all right?

166
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,999
Put it under your bed.
Make some room for Trish's coats. All right?

167
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:31,407
Here you go.

168
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:37,507
Take this, and this,
and how about this?

169
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:41,019
There you go. Very good.
Go, go... Thank you.

170
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,418
Are you okay?

171
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:50,326
Yeah. I'm just not sure that he is.

172
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,524
He's gonna be okay.
Just give him time.

173
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:59,631
- Trish, this is Sally.
- Hi, Trish.

174
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:01,867
- Thanks for helping.
- No sweat.

175
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,070
I hope you're hungry.
I'm gonna be ordering from Tufano's.

176
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:08,478
Tell them to send Billy.
He's totally hot.

177
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,683
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice meeting you.

178
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:16,383
I'm really glad you're
finally moving in.

179
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:18,685
Thanks.

180
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,498
Now it'll be easier for me
to borrow your clothes.

181
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:48,115
Jake.

182
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,925
Could you knock first?

183
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,226
Oh. Sorry.

184
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,268
Um, I'm sorry about the closet.

185
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,772
I know this must be really hard
for you, Jake.

186
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:14,177
I mean, it's a really big change.

187
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,380
And I just,
I just want you to know that

188
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:24,881
if you ever want to talk about anything
I would really like that.

189
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:29,988
I'm not going to call you 'Mom.' Okay?

190
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:33,396
Good.
Because I don't really want you to.

191
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:36,197
'Trish' works just fine for me. Deal?

192
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,199
Okay.

193
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:45,005
Hi, Mr. Fleming.

194
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:09,653
You can see how the shape of these
characters reflect their meanings.

195
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:12,859
This is the character 'ki.'

196
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,666
In English, it's 'tree.'

197
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:24,472
If you add another tree to it,
it becomes 'hayashi.'

198
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,978
In English it means 'woods.'

199
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:32,576
If you add another ki to it,
it becomes 'forest.'

200
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:36,486
Does anybody know how
to read this two Kanzi?

201
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:49,496
Sorry.

202
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,518
Now what does this look like?

203
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,520
Okay, I'll give you a clue.

204
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:22,134
Now, even with my awful righting,
I'm not a drawer.

205
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,940
But, as you can see, that it's a gate.

206
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,842
And, it's structured by two doors.

207
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,142
And the interesting thing...

208
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:48,260
Hey, Allison.
Are you feeling okay, sweetie?

209
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:51,456
Because I've been
really worried about you.

210
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,864
I heard you went to see
the school shrink this morning.

211
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,469
Poor thing.

212
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,317
I'm sorry.

213
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:32,517
- You're late.
- I know. I had to close up.

214
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,522
Let's go.

215
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:56,645
Pick anyone you like.

216
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,880
Let's go with this one.

217
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:11,096
Welcome, this is 8,900 Yen.

218
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,712
- I like it.
- Good.

219
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,213
Get comfortable. I'll be back.

220
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:00,172
Stop, Michael!

221
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,474
It tickles.

222
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:40,507
Miyuki.

223
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:31,291
Hello?

224
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,486
Karen?

225
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,493
Karen?

226
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:10,252
Let's begin with the first
incident three years ago.

227
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,959
Your colleagues were the primary
investigators on that case?

228
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,466
That is correct.

229
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:21,667
It's my understanding that
these colleagues have since disappeared.

230
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:28,179
They have.

231
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:31,182
A mother and the child were
killed in that house.

232
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:33,081
The husband murdered them.
I have questions about?

233
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,486
The incident happened as
reported in the local papers.

234
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,387
Understood.

235
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,495
Recently an American
family died in that house...

236
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,296
also under suspicious circumstances.

237
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:53,703
I cannot get into those details.

238
00:39:55,943 --> 00:40:00,209
So, two incidents?
Two families died in one house?

239
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:09,416
So, two incidents?
Two families died in one house.

240
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,933
I cannot get into those details.

241
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:30,537
So, two incidents?
Two families died in one house.

242
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,230
Hello.

243
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,839
The cops said you were the one
that pulled my sister out of the fire.

244
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:44,646
I'm sorry about your sister.

245
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,956
I know why your sister did what she did.

246
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:04,800
- Here.
- Thanks.

247
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,305
Karen found all this stuff online.

248
00:42:10,644 --> 00:42:13,010
Terrible things happened in that house.

249
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:18,815
I've been covering this story since
I moved to Tokyo three years ago.

250
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,411
Karen would've never done this.
It doesn't make any sense.

251
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:30,824
Ever since your sister
went inside that house...

252
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:35,826
she felt like
someone was there with her...

253
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,838
something watching her...

254
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:40,833
threatening her.

255
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,746
How do you know that?

256
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:53,349
Ever since I've been in the house
I've been experiencing the same things.

257
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,359
Your sister burned down
that house because...

258
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,188
she thought it would stop.

259
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:06,497
But the fire changed something.

260
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:09,696
I think it's getting worse.

261
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,300
Where are you going?

262
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,603
I was hoping you could tell me
something I don't already know.

263
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:21,409
But you can't.

264
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,009
I'm not even sure what I'm looking for anyways.

265
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,518
I've got no choice
but to go back to the house.

266
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,020
Well, I'll go with you.

267
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:32,321
- I don't want you to go.
- I'm going with you.

268
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,818
I am not leaving here until
I find out why my sister is dead.

269
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:32,496
So what's it gonna be,
PB & J or chicken salad?

270
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:38,600
Last night... did you hear it?

271
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:41,009
Okay, PB & J it is

272
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:45,307
Lacey, didn't you hear it?

273
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,613
There were sounds.

274
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,923
From next door.

275
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,530
What could you hear?

276
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,259
I heard the Flemings coming home.

277
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:08,166
They looked really... weird.

278
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:11,175
Weird? How?

279
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:12,869
Well, yesterday I...

280
00:47:13,013 --> 00:47:16,574
I'm sorry, you guys.
Why didn't you get me up?

281
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:19,679
Good morning.

282
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:23,883
Tonight's final cut.
I'm pretty sure I'll make it.

283
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:26,083
You're totally gonna make it.

284
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:29,391
- Are you nervous?
- Not really.

285
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,691
- You should've tried out.
- Oh, please.

286
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,106
Jake!

287
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,508
Jake!
C'mon, hurry up!

288
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:59,956
Hello? Hey, Nate.

289
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:06,261
Really?
No, he never said that to me.

290
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,164
I don't know, maybe he left a message
on the cell, I'm not sure.

291
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:16,071
See, he wouldn't say that to me.
He would just say that to you.

292
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:19,579
Because he likes you, that's why.

293
00:48:21,515 --> 00:48:23,176
You don't have to be coy.

294
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:27,778
I know, It's important to be professional
but you have to have a life.

295
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:38,989
Who are you talking to?

296
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:40,895
It's just Nate.

297
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:44,401
Are you okay?

298
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,903
I forgot my keys.

299
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,406
I'll go check the bedroom.

300
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:37,683
Come in.

301
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:44,995
Vanessa, please have a seat.

302
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:56,303
Allison has been telling me an
interesting story that I'd like you to verify.

303
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:58,104
A story about what?

304
00:49:59,446 --> 00:50:04,213
About a visit you made with her
and Miyuki Nazawa to a certain house.

305
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:07,013
I'm sorry, Miss Dale,
but I don't know what she told you.

306
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:11,818
Please, Vanessa,
no one is in trouble here.

307
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,427
I just need to find out exactly
what happened in that house.

308
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,535
Miyuki is missing.

309
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,240
We just got the call.

310
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:33,744
Apparently she never came home
last night.

311
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,338
She said she was going to be
with her boyfriend, Michael.

312
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:42,353
Yes, we've spoken with him.
He said she disappeared.

313
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:47,256
Now you can understand, Vanessa,
how important it is that we hear the truth.

314
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:50,954
Why did you do this to me?

315
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,657
Why did you take me to that place?

316
00:50:57,904 --> 00:50:59,769
You wanted to come.

317
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,204
What did I ever do to you?

318
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:04,003
Allison, wait!

319
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,509
Wait here.

320
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:09,396
Miyuki?

321
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:46,120
Miyuki... is that you?

322
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,996
- Wait here.
- No, I... want...

323
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:32,899
Please. Just stay here.

324
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,077
Eason...

325
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,302
Aubrey...

326
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,111
please don't go in that house.

327
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:13,357
Aubrey! What are you doing in here?

328
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:16,367
Something pulled me in.

329
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:20,867
- I told you to stay outside.
- I didn't know...

330
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:23,069
We have to go. Now.

331
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:35,479
Kayako kept this journal her whole life.

332
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:38,983
She was only eight
when she wrote this part.

333
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:45,496
I don't understand it,
but it looks creepy as hell.

334
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:50,694
It's not creepy. It's sad.

335
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:53,303
Apparently, her mother was an Itako.

336
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:55,699
Itako? What is that?

337
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:01,141
It's a kind of channeler.

338
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:05,146
People believe they can talk with
deceased loved ones through them.

339
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:10,744
But... I don't understand this part.

340
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:17,159
I have a friend. He's really into folklore.
I think he can help us.

341
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:27,364
This is not Itako.

342
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:32,173
Wait.

343
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:43,886
This person who is written in diary
did channeler, but...

344
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:49,392
I can't say
this is channeler exactly.

345
00:58:50,328 --> 00:58:54,492
I mean, something...

346
00:58:57,135 --> 00:59:01,435
He says what Kayako wrote was about
the rituals her mother performed...

347
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,637
and how they were somewhat abnormal.

348
00:59:14,085 --> 00:59:18,351
I can't explain it in English.

349
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,050
Shaman...

350
00:59:21,693 --> 00:59:23,354
Exorcist.

351
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:28,361
It must be named Exorcist.

352
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:34,770
There's no real word to
describe it in English, but...

353
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,875
the closest thing would be 'exorcist'.

354
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:52,088
She did this to her daughter.

355
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:58,494
Take demon away from
people's mind or body.

356
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,297
- What is it?
- She let daughter eat

357
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,799
- Eason?
- Demon everyday.

358
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:06,096
Eason!

359
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:09,304
I've never heard about it.

360
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:14,104
It... it sounds like her mother
was able to cure people

361
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:16,805
through extracting evil spirits...

362
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,416
out of their bodies...

363
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:25,018
and feeding them to her daughter.

364
01:00:26,157 --> 01:00:27,317
What?

365
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:54,042
First thing tomorrow
morning we have to go see her.

366
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:56,746
See who?

367
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,389
Kayako's mother.

368
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:11,600
I've tried everything.
I even went back to the house. I...

369
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:15,499
Look...

370
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:22,207
if she can really take evil spirits
out of people, maybe she can help us.

371
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:28,817
I don't know what to believe any more.

372
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:36,825
We don't have a choice.
It's our only hope.

373
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:40,225
Okay.

374
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:59,043
This is the research
I was doing for the story.

375
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,981
I've got her childhood address...

376
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:05,882
right here.

377
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:20,101
It's a small village.

378
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:30,810
The train will only take us halfway.
We'll have to switch to a bus.

379
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:44,524
Last time I saw Karen,
we got into this huge fight.

380
01:02:46,364 --> 01:02:48,127
It was really stupid.

381
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:56,631
She took me out to lunch and she
dropped this college application on me...

382
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:59,971
and I... I was just...

383
01:03:12,023 --> 01:03:13,991
I was so pissed.

384
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,790
I thought she was trying to be
just like my mother.

385
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:28,699
I screamed at her to stop trying
to change my life and leave me alone.

386
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:34,706
She did.

387
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:40,110
We never spoke again until last night.

388
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:51,024
I always, I always blamed Karen for
my mother's indifference towards me.

389
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,534
But I know that wasn't true,
and I really...

390
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,760
I really regret...

391
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:08,076
Well, you know, it's strange.

392
01:04:08,613 --> 01:04:13,778
Back in Hong Kong, my brother lived
a few blocks away from me for four years.

393
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:17,283
We never even tried to see each other.

394
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,792
I'll make some tea.

395
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:28,693
Yeah, thanks.

396
01:07:21,305 --> 01:07:22,670
Eason?

397
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:35,780
Eason?

398
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,540
Eason? Are you in here?

399
01:08:08,686 --> 01:08:09,948
Eason?

400
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:40,376
Eason?

401
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:47,283
Eason...

402
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:52,486
Eason... Eason!

403
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:53,790
Eason!

404
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:26,754
Jeez, you sick or something?

405
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,060
So... what do you think?

406
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,683
Sally, are you okay?

407
01:10:11,342 --> 01:10:12,502
Jake?

408
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:17,413
No, it's okay.
I'll be right there.

409
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,817
I have to go.

410
01:10:32,963 --> 01:10:34,123
Jake?

411
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:51,741
Jake?

412
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:05,886
God!

413
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,890
Jake. What are you doing in here?

414
01:11:09,033 --> 01:11:12,901
I... I was scared.

415
01:11:13,037 --> 01:11:15,096
What were you scared of?

416
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:16,706
Trish.

417
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:19,709
And Dad.

418
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:25,811
They were fighting, Lacey.

419
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:29,817
Where are they?

420
01:11:31,255 --> 01:11:35,021
I... I don't know...

421
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,428
But I wish Mom was here.

422
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:44,529
Jake...

423
01:12:39,757 --> 01:12:41,315
Mr. Fleming?

424
01:13:49,059 --> 01:13:50,219
Hi...

425
01:14:31,435 --> 01:14:32,902
What's wrong, Jake?

426
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:35,903
I went next door and I...

427
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,302
- You went where?
- Next door.

428
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:44,805
I saw something in the window... eyes.

429
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:47,314
It's all right, Jake. It's okay.

430
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:49,817
Something is really wrong, Lacey.

431
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:54,613
Tomorrow I promise
I'll go there with you. Okay?

432
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,429
Just try and get some sleep now.

433
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:42,503
Dammit!

434
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:32,786
You got home late last night.

435
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:37,188
Where were you?

436
01:16:44,134 --> 01:16:45,294
Come in.

437
01:16:56,847 --> 01:16:58,212
Allison...

438
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:02,051
Allison, are you all right?

439
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,655
Maybe we should go see the nurse.

440
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,148
I want to go home.

441
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,264
Take a breath.

442
01:17:17,401 --> 01:17:21,360
Tell me what's going on.
You can talk to me.

443
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:27,570
It was that house.

444
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:34,274
There was something there
when I was there.

445
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:35,578
I...

446
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:46,393
I just want to go home.

447
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:52,901
Allison, Listen...
I've been to that house with the police.

448
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:55,402
There's nothing there.

449
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:58,804
It's just an abandoned house.

450
01:18:00,077 --> 01:18:04,138
You... went there?

451
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:10,951
Yes, I did.

452
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:13,853
She's going to come for you.

453
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:19,758
She got Miyuki and Vanessa...

454
01:18:19,896 --> 01:18:22,262
and now she's after me.

455
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:23,559
Allison...

456
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:28,864
I don't know what you're talking about.

457
01:18:31,608 --> 01:18:33,872
- What?
- They are right here.

458
01:21:08,532 --> 01:21:09,794
Hello?

459
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:49,632
I need to speak to you about
your daughter Kayako.

460
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:57,642
I saw the journal.
I know you can get rid of evil spirits.

461
01:22:00,317 --> 01:22:02,182
She is dead.

462
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,981
You did this.
You made her what she was.

463
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:08,590
Now, I need you to help me
help me end this.

464
01:22:08,725 --> 01:22:10,090
Wait!

465
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:19,399
People came looking for me.

466
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:23,804
Full of pain and suffering...

467
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:39,119
I took the dark spirits from them.

468
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:43,717
And so did my daughter.

469
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:48,219
You poisoned her.
Look what she has become.

470
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:54,025
I did not create this evil.

471
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:59,233
Kayako was killed by her
husband because she was foolish.

472
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:02,576
That is where the curse started.

473
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:06,878
I did not make her what she is now.

474
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:13,581
My sister tried to burn down
the house where Kayako was killed.

475
01:23:14,624 --> 01:23:16,592
She thought if she burned down
the house that it would stop?

476
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:19,593
This is not about a house.

477
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:24,798
You are just making things worse.

478
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:27,894
This is rage.

479
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:33,505
She wants us to suffer the way
she has suffered.

480
01:23:36,046 --> 01:23:40,506
- No. We have to make it stop.
- No, it will not stop.

481
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:46,916
It will grow
and destroy everything it touches.

482
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:50,720
It will spread beyond the house.

483
01:23:52,762 --> 01:23:56,323
There can be no end to what has started.

484
01:24:01,705 --> 01:24:05,266
You brought her here.

485
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,150
Hey.

486
01:26:03,193 --> 01:26:04,751
Are you okay?

487
01:26:04,894 --> 01:26:06,452
Something bad.

488
01:26:08,198 --> 01:26:09,358
What?

489
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:11,865
Something bad lives there.

490
01:26:13,203 --> 01:26:15,865
That is what's making
everything else bad here.

491
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:23,879
Come on, Jake.
Let's go.

492
01:26:37,227 --> 01:26:38,387
Dad?

493
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:41,494
Trish?

494
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:57,908
Dad?

495
01:27:18,902 --> 01:27:20,460
Just wait here.

496
01:27:21,804 --> 01:27:24,864
Dad? Trish?

497
01:27:40,723 --> 01:27:41,883
Hello?

498
01:27:45,028 --> 01:27:46,393
Hi, Mom, it's me.

499
01:27:46,529 --> 01:27:49,498
I've been waiting for you.

500
01:27:50,934 --> 01:27:55,701
Where have you been?
How is Karen?

501
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:04,139
She's gone, mom.

502
01:28:06,683 --> 01:28:09,243
- I'm sorry.
- She's gone?

503
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:19,054
I know how much you loved her. I...

504
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:21,957
I know she was everything to you.

505
01:28:22,098 --> 01:28:26,762
Why have you done this? You were...
You were supposed to bring her back!

506
01:28:28,204 --> 01:28:30,866
You could never do anything
on your own.

507
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:36,469
I love you so much...

508
01:28:38,915 --> 01:28:41,884
but you can't talk to me
like this anymore.

509
01:28:44,921 --> 01:28:46,980
This has to end.

510
01:28:47,123 --> 01:28:48,385
Aubrey!

511
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:55,596
- Aubrey!
- I love you, Mom. Goodbye.

512
01:29:35,905 --> 01:29:37,770
My sister is dead.

513
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:43,374
You killed her...

514
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:48,174
just like you killed the others.

515
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:55,289
You won't stop. Why?

516
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:58,487
What do you want?

517
01:30:04,834 --> 01:30:05,994
Doug?

518
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:14,407
Wait... Karen!

519
01:30:17,647 --> 01:30:18,909
Karen?

520
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:22,816
Karen, no!

521
01:31:34,157 --> 01:31:35,419
Lacey!

522
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:42,021
Lacey! Lacey!

523
01:31:49,572 --> 01:31:51,733
Lacey! Lacey!

524
01:31:51,874 --> 01:31:54,638
No. No

525
01:31:54,777 --> 01:31:56,540
Lacey!

526
01:31:56,679 --> 01:31:58,442
- No!
- Jake.

527
01:32:17,633 --> 01:32:19,396
It's time for your bath.

528
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:18,086
Karen?

529
01:35:52,448 --> 01:35:57,715
They say this is one of the most
haunted houses...

530
01:35:57,853 --> 01:36:00,754
in all of Japan.

531
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:02,357
Yeah.

532
01:36:02,491 --> 01:36:05,654
And that anyone who goes
inside gets the curse.

533
01:36:22,111 --> 01:36:24,773
All the other girls
have been too afraid to try.

534
01:36:24,914 --> 01:36:27,883
Only me and Miyuki
have been able to do it so far.

535
01:36:51,941 --> 01:36:53,203
Help me!

536
01:36:54,143 --> 01:36:56,304
Please, you have to help me!

537
01:37:07,089 --> 01:37:08,647
He killed her.

538
01:37:09,992 --> 01:37:11,960
He snapped her neck.

539
01:37:13,496 --> 01:37:18,365
If you close your eyes
and count to ten...

540
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:21,664
when you open them again,
you'll see her.

541
01:37:28,811 --> 01:37:32,474
It's all your fault!
What did you do?

542
01:37:34,016 --> 01:37:35,881
What did you bring here?

543
01:37:36,018 --> 01:37:41,183
It followed me here.
They followed me here.
