1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,559
When the value of the x coordinate is
equal to or less than the value of...

2
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,301
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

3
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,701
Why?

4
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:56,801
I just put that up there as a joke.
That's probably the hardest
geometry equation in the world

5
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,501
How much extra credit is it worth?

6
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,081
Well, I've never seen anyone get it right
including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT.

7
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:08,302
I guess if anyone here can solve that problem

8
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:12,963
I'd see to it that none of you ever have to open
another math book again for the rest of your lives.

9
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:24,849
Max ? You want to try it ?

10
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:30,603
I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?

11
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,559
You got it

12
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:39,407
You guys have it real easy.
I never had it like this where I grew up

13
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:45,468
But I send my kids here. Because the fact is
you go to one of the best schools in the country

14
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,107
Rushmore

15
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:54,978
Now, for some of you it doesn't matter.
You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich

16
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,108
But here's my advice to the rest of you

17
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:07,281
Take dead aim on the rich boys.
Get them in the crosshairs

18
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,309
And take them down

19
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:17,009
Just remember. They can buy anything.
But they can't buy backbone.

20
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:21,909
Don't let them forget that. Thank you.

21
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,930
Are you free for graduation, Herman?
Maybe you could give us an encore.

22
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,610
I don't give a shit.

23
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,810
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.
The least these little pricks can do is
hear me out.

24
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,311
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

25
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:48,446
I just wanted to tell you I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

26
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,311
Your speech was excellent

27
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:58,338
This is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway

28
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:13,312
I really think
you're right about Rushmore.

29
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:20,313
- What's his name again?
- Max Fisher

30
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,213
He's a sharp little guy

31
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,313
He's one of the worst students we've got

32
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:49,395
We're putting you on what we call
sudden death academic probation

33
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:51,818
And what does that entail?

34
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:56,318
It entails that if you fail another class
you are going to be asked to leave Rushmore.

35
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,118
- In other words, I'll be expelled.
- That's correct

36
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,319
Can I see some documentation?

37
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,919
Too Many extra curricular activities, Max

38
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:20,920
I don't want to tell you how to do your job
But the fact is no matter how hard I try,
I still might flunkanother class

39
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,690
And if that means I have to stay on
for a post-graduate year, then so be it.

40
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,922
We don't offer a post-graduate year.

41
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:31,420
- We don't offer it yet.
- Just bring up the grades

42
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:35,720
Do you remember how I got into this school?

43
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:38,321
Yes, you wrote a play

44
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:43,621
That's right. Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate

45
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,772
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

46
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,249
You read it and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ?

47
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:54,922
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it

48
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,622
But I still might have to expel you

49
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:03,522
Couldn't we just let me float by?
For old times' sake?

50
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:06,722
I can't do it, Max.

51
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:12,724
- They want to kick me out
- Oh, no. Not again. What are you going to do?

52
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:16,894
The only thing I can do.
Try and pull some strings with the administration

53
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,061
<SYNC start=440656>

54
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:26,123
- Did you hear they're teaching Japanese next year?
- That's the rumor

55
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:29,524
- And they're canceling Latin.
- What?

56
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:35,287
I tried to get Latin canceled for five years
"It's a dead language", I'd always say

57
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,582
Well, I guess they finally heard you.

00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:54,625
Excuse me!

61
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,425
Could I see a list of all the people
who've checked out this book in the past year?

62
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,326
Look at that

63
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:51,928
I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both
and I believe they both get paid in the end

64
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,528
But the fools first

65
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:58,629
Chapter fifteen: The Lad with the Silver Button

66
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,629
- Meet me on the corner in 10 minutes
- Where are you goin'?

<SYNC start=554300>

68
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,330
Excellent! That's was Excellent!

<SYNC start=567062>

<SYNC start=570482>

72
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,731
I told Mr. Calloway the other day
how fortunate we are
to have someone like you looking out for Dirk.

73
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:42,131
I'm just trying to impart
some of the experiences I've accrued
to help him.

74
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:48,163
This has my number on it

75
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:51,332
- Hello, Dirk?
- Hi, mom!

76
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:02,176
- How'd the math test go?
- What math test?

77
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,533
- No. Did you turn in your paper on the Berlin Airlift?
- Yeah, I got an extension.

78
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:12,433
- So how did it go with Mrs. Calloway?
- We shook hands

79
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,333
- Big Deal!
- And I gave her my phone number

80
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,833
- Buchan said he'd have already banged her by now
- What?

81
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,863
<SYNC start=624697>

82
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,734
That's my best friend's mother he's talking about

83
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,334
I thought that's why you picked Dirk
as your chapel partner.

84
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,134
What are you, a lawyer?

85
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,834
It's Max Fisher.
- Oh, hi!

86
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:43,549
...

87
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:52,635
What's the secret, Max?
- The secret?

88
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,535
Yeah. You seem to have it pretty figured out

89
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,235
I don't know.

90
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:04,485
I think you just gotta find something you love to do,
then do it for the rest of your life

91
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,336
For me, it's going to Rushmore

92
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,737
Did you invite that kid to your party?
- Max Fisher?

93
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:30,037
- There's gonna be girls there. I'd rather die
- Pull your head out of your ass

94
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:36,766
Do vidjenja. -Bog, Max.
-Vidimo se sutra.

95
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,444
May I see the back, please?

96
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:55,826
- That's it
- Thank, you

97
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,707
I need a signature on this geometry test

98
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,797
I know...

99
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,340
37%.

100
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
I don't know what to do anymore

101
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:23,145
It could have been worse.
You almost got the A

102
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:35,341
Maybe I'm spending too much of my time
starting up clubs and putting on plays

103
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,041
That's possible

104
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:46,442
I should probably be trying harder to score chicks.
That's the only thing anybody really cares about.
Butit's not my forte, unfortunately.

105
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:48,742
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

106
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:53,842
You're like one of those clipper ship captains
You're married to the sea

107
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,592
Yes, that's true

108
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,442
But I've been out to sea for a long time

109
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:09,271
Hello?
- Hi

110
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,117
- I like your hat
- Oh, thank you

111
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:25,703
You're a teacher here, aren't you?

112
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:31,584
- And this is your first year at Rushmore
- Uh-huh

113
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,045
How long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

114
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:41,145
- How old are you?
- 15

115
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:44,389
- Since I was your age
- You're kidding

116
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,433
- You should quit
- You're right

117
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:54,190
And I should mind my own business

118
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:02,948
- Where'd you go to school, by the way?
- Harvard

119
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:09,411
Really? That's a coincidence.
My top schools where I want to apply to are
Oxford and The Sorbonne.But my safety is Harvard

120
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:12,872
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you

121
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:14,500
What do you want to study?

122
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:22,747
I haven't decided for sure.
But probably a double major
in Mathematics and Pre-Med

123
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,747
What was your major?

124
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:29,648
I didn't have a major. But my thesis was on
Latin American Economic policy

125
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:34,311
Ah, that's interesting. Did you hear
they're not going to teach Latin here anymore?

126
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,524
This was more like Central America

127
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,648
Oh, Central America and whatnot

128
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:46,114
But moving on, they're gonna cancel Latin.
They've got to make room for Japanese

129
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:51,327
That's a shame because
all the Romance Languages are based on Latin

130
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:55,664
- Yeah, they are
- Nihilo sanctum estne?

131
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,349
What's that?
That's Latin, isn't it?

132
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:01,628
What does that mean?

133
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:04,841
Is nothing sacred?

134
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:17,686
Sic transit gloria : Glory fades

Never in my wildest imagination did I ever dream
I would have sons like this

142
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,353
What does your dad do, Max

143
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:16,284
He's a neurosurgeon at St. Joseph's Hospital.

144
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:22,331
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain.
But he seems to enjoy it

145
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:27,210
Oh, no! I got this one

146
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:32,257
- You were in Vietnam, if I'm not mistaken?
- Yeah

147
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:36,303
- You were in the shit?
- Yeah, I was in the shit

148
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:44,955
What's on Sunday? Oh, that's right.
The Twin's birthday party

149
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,356
Do you wanna come?

150
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:55,946
I'd love to. Except I've already got
previous occupations to attend to.
Thanks for the invitation, though

151
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,661
- Come work for me
- What do you mean?

152
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:06,999
I mean, I could use someone like you

153
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:12,963
I may not be rich, Mr. Blume
And my father may only be a doctor
But we manage

155
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:16,557
Excuse me, Mr. Blume
Nice talking to you

156
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:20,157
You're on the team?

157
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:22,263
I'm an alternate

158
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,363
Miss Cross?

159
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:03,163
I thought I would just let you know
as per our conversation the other day...

160
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:07,364
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance Languages.
I gave a little speech

161
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:10,464
- I heard about this
- You did?

162
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:13,412
I understand you made a very convincing argument.

163
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:19,764
I thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're going to continue the Latin program.

164
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:23,880
- I'm very impressed
- Thank you very much

165
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:29,865
- You need an assistant?
- Do we get to have assistants around here?

166
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:35,682
I doubt it. I'm on scholarship, though.
Academic scholarship. So I get to do odd jobs.

167
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:42,314
- How did you decide to teach at Rushmore?
- My husband went here.

168
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:46,731
I didn't know you were married.

169
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:50,779
Well, he's dead now.
So I'm not actually

170
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,659
- When did he die?
- Last year

171
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:01,367
- My mother's dead
- I'm sorry to hear that

172
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,251
She died when I was seven.

173
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:09,797
So we both have dead people in our families.

174
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:16,513
Now what's going on in here?

175
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:21,100
These were just born

176
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:26,064
I don't want any alloys.
I want steel.

177
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:29,400
I don't give a rat's ass if he did

178
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:33,988
Steel, Harry

179
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:39,949
- You change your mind? You want the job?
- No. But I've got an idea. And need some money

180
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:48,269
Rushmore deserves an aquarium.
A first class aquarium where scientists can lecture
and students canobserve marine life in its natural -

181
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:50,870
- I don't know. What do you think, Ernie
- Aquarium?

182
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:57,370
- What kind of fish?
- Barracudas. Stingrays. Hammerheads. Piranhas...

183
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:01,770
- Piranhas? Really?
- Yes, I'm talking to a guy in South America.

184
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:07,269
- What did Guggenheim say?
- Nothing. I thought I should go to you first

185
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:12,857
Because at this moment
I feel our best strategy is to keep a low profile.

186
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:16,371
The more preparation I can do,
the stronger our case will be
when we take it to the administration.

187
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:22,871
- How much money do you want?
- $35.000 for the initial plans

188
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:35,213
- I'll give you $2500
- O.K.

189
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,274
<SYNC start=1320446>

190
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,075
- Thank you
- You're welcome

191
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:05,277
Max?

192
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:09,677
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure

193
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:14,983
Has it ever crossed your mind that
you're way too young for me?

194
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:23,378
It's crossed by mind that
you might consider that a possibility, yes.

195
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:25,693
Not to mention you're a student...

196
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:31,379
I'm not trying to pressure you into anything, Miss Cross.
I'm surprised you brought it up so bluntly.

197
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,379
I just want to make sure...

198
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,379
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes

199
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:49,380
And the truth is neither one of us has
the slightest idea where this relationships is going.
We can'tpredict the future.

200
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,880
- We don't have a relationship, Max
- But we're friends

201
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,100
- Yes. And that's all we're going to be
- That's what I meant by relationship.
You want me to graba dictionary?

202
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:07,817
- I just want to make sure we understand each other
- I understand. You're not attracted to me

203
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,181
C'est la vie.

204
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:19,743
- Max. You're fifteen. Attraction doesn't enter into it
- If you say so

205
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:22,831
All I'm getting is...

206
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,587
I've never met anyone like you

207
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:32,215
You can take that for whatever it's worth

208
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:39,097
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you, either

209
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:44,727
You haven't, have you?

210
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:49,981
You want to shake hands?

211
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:54,945
- I'm glad we had this conversation
- So am I

212
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:58,684
I can't wear a wire!
They're feeling me up every day!

213
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:01,744
Oh, Come on. You'll have complete protection

214
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:05,621
I've heard that one before
I got to go put a dime in the meter

215
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:08,913
Joe, put a dime in the meter for officer Serpico

216
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:11,669
- If you agree to testify in open court...
- No!

217
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:15,765
- No what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify

218
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,760
I expect your gun and badge on my desk

219
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:29,385
Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
You're going to follow this all the way
to the end of the line, where Igot to be.

220
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:31,386
So help me, God!

<SYNC start=1538849>

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,530
<SYNC start=1545107>

223
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:51,958
What happened to the cannoli line?
You're supposed to say "Forget about it, Sanchez"

224
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,187
I made a mistake, all right?
It doesn't make any difference, anyway

225
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,755
Hey, I'm letting it go. But don't tell me it doesn't matter. Every line matters.

226
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:02,134
- Get off my back!
- Don't fuck with my play!

227
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,106
Max!

228
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,759
- I thought the acting tonight was excellent
- Thanks. Well, it was better in rehersals

229
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:49,092
I'll catch up with you later, Dad
I've got a dinner to go to

230
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:51,724
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, cast and crew only

231
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:55,484
- You need some money?
- No, Dad

232
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,814
<SYNC start=1622009>

233
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:04,694
- Max, that was great!
- I'm so glad you could come

234
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:07,791
I want you to meet a friend of mine
Peter Flynn. Max Fischer

235
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:12,450
- Who's this guy?
- Peter

236
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:16,392
I really liked your play
It was really cool

237
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,592
What happened to your nose?

238
00:27:21,092 --> 00:27:23,628
I got punched in the place

239
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,392
What's your excuse?

240
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:27,298
Hey, arthur!

241
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,792
- How you doing?
- Nice job

242
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:33,393
- Am I going to get to meet your dad tonight, Max?
- Oh, no. The old man's on call

243
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:37,393
Mr. Blume, I'd like you to meet Miss Cross
and I didn't catch this young gentleman's name

244
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:44,853
- I like your nurse's uniform, guy
- These are OR scrubs

245
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:46,399
OR they?

246
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,504
- Well, they're totally inappropriate for the occasion
- Well, I didn't know we were going to dinner

247
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,208
- That's because you weren't invited
- Take it easy, Max

248
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,914
You're the one who ordered him a Scotch and soda

249
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,544
What's wrong with that? I can write a hit play

250
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:06,394
Why can't I have a drink when I want myself?

251
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:14,426
- So tell me, Curly. How do you know Miss Cross?
- We went to Harvard together

252
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:17,695
And I wrote a hit play. And directed it
So I'm not sweating it, either

253
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:22,395
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm getting the check

254
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:24,396
No, you're not. Excuse me.

255
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:27,096
I just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us.

256
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:32,396
We only expected to be a party of three,
but somebody invited himself along. I apologize.

257
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:34,655
- Quite all right
- OK

258
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,896
- You're being rude, Max.
- No, I'm not

259
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:45,097
I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play
And my dinner, which wasinvitation only

260
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:49,251
- Would you like me to pass you the butter?
- Yes, please

261
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,589
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

262
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:57,759
You hurt my feelings
This night was important to me

263
00:28:57,992 --> 00:29:01,993
- How did I hurt your feelings?
- Oh, my god!

264
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:05,151
I wrote a hit play

265
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,690
And I'm in love with you

266
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:44,763
- Hi
- Were you hiding over there?

267
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:48,724
Didn't wanna distrupt class

268
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:54,063
- What's that you're painting?
- That's a jelly fish

269
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:59,401
- What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?
- Max wants to talk to you

270
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:03,401
- What for?
- To apologize, I think

271
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,450
We should talk over here

272
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:11,831
- He sent you here?
- Yeah

273
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:16,460
- Are you his messenger?
- No. I'm his friend

274
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:22,925
You were right
I shouldn't have allow him to drink

275
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:30,556
I don't think I should see Max anymore
- He's not going to like the sound of that

276
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:36,146
I know. But I think I let him get too attached

277
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:42,066
- What do you think?
- Oh, I think you your did the best

278
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,904
Tell him I'm sorry

279
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,544
What's your first name?

280
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:05,758
- Rosemary. What's yours?
- Herman

281
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:12,605
He wrote you a letter.

282
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:19,813
Dear Miss Cross, I would like to take this opportunity
to formly apologize for the events of night of the23th

283
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:21,856
I am not accustomed to drinking alcohol.

284
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,906
Please do me the service of
coming to the unveiling of a new venture
I have undertaken

285
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:29,195
I hope you will attend, if possible.

286
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,806
I remain your friend, Max Fisher.

287
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:41,607
- Cut the music

288
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,507
- What time is it?
- 1:15

289
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:50,407
- Did you see her?
- She's not here

290
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,007
Go check the classroom

291
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,808
- Should we go ahead and take care of this tree?
- Let's wait a few minutes

292
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:57,515
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Beck, good to see you

293
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:01,644
This is where they're building the new aquarium
I'm in charge of the committee, if you can believe it

294
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:07,983
- This is the baseball diamond
- I believe it's being relocated a few feet over

295
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:10,860
Is it true the aquarium will have piranhas?

296
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:13,947
- Where'd you hear that?
- My source indicated that it was a possibility

297
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,409
- Yes, it's true but promises are very tricky
- Max

298
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:22,109
- Bad news
- What's the story?

299
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,609
- She has a substitute teacher today
- Why?

300
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,409
- I guess she got sick
- You know she's not sick. Give me the phone

301
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,384
Janet! Max Fischer.
Is Blume there?

302
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:39,846
Oh, where is he?
Goddammit, he's supposed to be here

303
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,893
I don't give a shit about barracudas
But fuck it. I'm building it anyway

304
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,857
Max!

305
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:56,411
- Hello, Dr. Guggenheim!
- What do you think you're doing?

306
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:58,615
- We're having a fund-raiser for...
- Turn that damn thing off

307
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,158
Tell me this isn't happening.

308
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:04,412
I'd rather not have this conversation
in front of the crew.

309
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,558
<SYNC start=2008647>

310
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:35,597
We have a new student with us today.

311
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:41,314
His name's Max Fischer and he's actually asked
to say a few words to the class.

312
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:47,027
- Max? You want to take it away?
- Sure. Thanks very much

313
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:51,414
I just wanted to introduce myself

314
00:33:57,004 --> 00:34:04,928
I'm Max Fischer.
I'm a former student of Rushmore Academy,
which I recently got expelled from

315
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:12,101
This is my first time in a public school.
And I know you probably think
I was born with a silverspoonin my mouth

316
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:21,444
But I'm no elitist. I think you've got some great facilities
and I'm really looking forward to making thebest
of it over here at Grover Cleveland.

317
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:28,534
One footnote: I noticed you don't have a fencing team.
I'm going to start one up.
Let me know if you'dlike to join

318
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:36,167
- Max?
- Yes?

319
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:41,087
Hi. I'm Margaret Yang. I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.
I just wanted to tell you I liked your speech

320
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,317
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before

321
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,136
How unfortunate!

322
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,265
The silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way
But I think I know how you meant it

323
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:57,396
Do you know it?
I gotta go to class right here

324
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:17,788
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

325
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,420
- Hey, Max. How's it going?
- Terrible

326
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,008
Tell me something.
When you talk to Miss Cross the other day...

327
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,963
- Excuse me. Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second

328
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:39,018
I got to tell you. I don't know what you see in her.
I don't think she's right for you.

329
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,896
What's that supposed to mean?

330
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:48,135
I mean, she's not that beautiful.
She's not that intriguing

331
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:52,977
She has something you can put your finger on. But...

332
00:35:52,977 --> 00:35:56,283
Look, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable.
But let's get to the point

333
00:35:56,659 --> 00:36:00,790
- Will she see me again? Yes or no?
- No

334
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,500
I'm talking on the telephone

335
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:08,503
Oh, Come on. That's rude.

336
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:26,023
Hey, Fisher!

337
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:29,566
You better beat it, sunnie

338
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:36,924
You know, Fischer. I've been watching you.
Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk -

339
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:39,950
- because his mother's a great piece
and then getting nowhere

340
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:45,539
Like everything you do.
Big show. No results.

341
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:50,425
What do you call getting a hand job
from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar?

342
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,221
A fucking lie?

343
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,425
You think I got kicked out for just the aquarium?
Nah. It was the hand job.

344
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:02,425
You wanna know something else?
It was worth it

345
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:11,482
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner
And please apologize to what's his name for me

346
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:18,237
- I will. Are you OK?
- I'm fine. But I miss Rushmore.

347
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,660
I miss the seasons.
And watching the leaves change

348
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:31,917
By the way, what time does the library close?
I got an overdue book to turn in

349
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,259
That's your handwriting, isn't it?

350
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,528
My husband gave me this book
when he came to visit to me when I was 13

351
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:49,728
And he went to Rushmore.
So when he died I gave it to the library here

352
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:58,025
- You remind me of him, you know?
- I do? How?

353
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:08,429
- You remember you were in the Rushmore Beekeepers?
- Yeah. I was President of them

354
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,964
He founded that club

355
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:25,330
- Do you think we can be friends again, Miss Cross?
In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course, I do

356
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:29,971
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

357
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,892
Yeah. But I need a tutor

358
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,981
OK! What else do we got?

359
00:39:58,224 --> 00:39:59,635
- Hi, Max
- Hello

360
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,736
- What was your name again?
- Margaret Yang

361
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,316
- What are you doing seventh period, Margaret Yang?
- I have guitar lessons

362
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:12,136
- Classical guitar or?
- Rock

363
00:40:12,136 --> 00:40:14,189
That's good. We can get out of it then

364
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:17,322
<SYNC start=2418597>

365
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:22,706
Put Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody.

366
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,437
And bring a headshot, please

367
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:41,438
- Hello, Herman.
- How are you, Rosemary?

368
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:46,936
Fine, thanks. I just got home
and I'm having a little snack

369
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:50,857
Having some carrots?

370
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:59,090
- Nice house!
- Yeah, it isn't mine. I'm just sort of housesitting

371
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:06,139
Were you in the neighborhood?

372
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:11,439
Didn't Max have something planned for us today?
A trip to the museum or something?

373
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:15,140
I don't think so.
I think he's rehearsing tonight

374
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,240
Oh. That's right. His new play

375
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:24,305
- He's really making a go of it over at Grover Cleveland
- Yeah. He's doing very well, isn't he?

376
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,352
You want a carrot?

377
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,271
Yeah. I'll have one of those

378
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:49,163
I'll probably be seeing you soon

379
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:56,011
Or we could go for a walk, if you like

380
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:10,017
- Sure
- Well, this is nice, isn't it?

381
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:15,854
Kind of brisk.
I'll just get a sweater. I'll be back in a minute

382
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:53,015
- Dirk?
- I know about you and the teacher

383
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:10,990
- Does Max know?
- No. And I don't want him to know.
I just want it to stop. Right now

384
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:16,162
You're a married man, Blume.
And you're supposed to be his friend

385
00:43:16,497 --> 00:43:22,710
- Look, Dirk. I am his friend
- Oh, yeah. And with friends like you, who needs friends?

386
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:37,683
Unlock it!

387
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:44,229
Little Calloway!

388
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:53,739
You're standing up for the wrong guy.
Fischer ain't your mate

389
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:59,949
- What are you talking about, Buchan?
- He thinks your mum's good for a bonk
That's why hepicked you as his chapel partner

390
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,649
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself

391
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:12,966
- He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar
- Max never said that

392
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:20,974
Yeah. I suppose you're right.
After all, the son of a brain doctor
doesn't need to impress anybody, doeshe?

393
00:44:22,558 --> 00:44:27,688
- The killing has got to stop, esse
It's getting too loco. No more gats
- Nigger, you're the crazy one

394
00:44:28,023 --> 00:44:31,067
People will be trying to kill you.
Are you talking about getting rid of your gun?

395
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:36,698
- It's time, homey
- Kiss me, Little One

396
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:41,827
Then he kisses her and we're out. OK
Is that for me?

397
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:47,208
Dear Max, I'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out
that Mr. Blume is having an affair with MissCross.

398
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:52,552
My first suspicions came
when I saw them frenching in front of her house
then I knew for sure whenthey went skinny dipping

399
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:58,969
in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs
while you were taking a nap on the frontporch

400
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:09,037
Why am I telling you this now?
Because you're such a good friend
Take care, pal. Fondly, DirkCalloway

401
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:13,479
<SYNC start=2714905>

402
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:18,613
- How was she, Herman?
- Jesus Christ!

403
00:45:19,656 --> 00:45:23,658
Was she good? I bet she was.
Although I wouldn't know 'cause I never screwed her

404
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:30,454
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap.
"Are you comfortable, Max?"

405
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:36,954
- "I'll just be out back nude
getting hand jobs from the woman you love"
- We never went skippingdipping

406
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:43,763
Sure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me
you didn't just walk out of her house
at twoo'clock in the morning

407
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:49,018
I'm in love with her

408
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:54,680
Well, I was in love with her first

409
00:45:55,981 --> 00:46:04,280
And all that crap about "I don't think she's that great"
"I don't think she's right for you, Max"
Thatwas all bullshit, wasn't it?

410
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:13,257
- Do you think she's in love with you?
- I don't know

411
00:46:13,457 --> 00:46:17,678
Well, I guarantee you she's not
And she never will be

412
00:46:19,253 --> 00:46:21,130
Max!

413
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,887
I saved Latin!

414
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,682
What'd you ever do?

415
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:39,540
On the planet I'm from
the sun only comes out once a year

416
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:43,759
- That is why my skin...
- Excuse me!

417
00:46:44,316 --> 00:46:47,238
I just came by to thank you for wrecking my life

418
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:54,459
Max, what are you doing?

419
00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:15,223
Hello? Mrs. Blume? This is Max Fisher
I have some information regarding your husband

420
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,736
Thank you for meeting me

421
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:30,613
You're welcome

422
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,491
Would you like a sandwich?

423
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:38,247
All right

424
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:47,494
- I have a tuna, peanut butter and jelly
I'm sorry it's not something more exotic
- I'll take the tunafish

425
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,428
Get to the point

426
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:16,115
- And how long will you be staying with us, Mr. Blume?
- Indefinitely. I'm being sued for a divorce

427
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:18,464
Shortie!

428
00:48:19,535 --> 00:48:24,873
- So can you tell me where the pool's located?
I might want to take a dip after I have the dinner
-It's on the roof, sir

429
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:10,449
5'3", a hundred and twleve pounds,
black hair, glasses...

430
00:51:28,173 --> 00:51:31,050
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad
Can you drop me off at Rushmore?
I got to go settle a score

431
00:51:31,217 --> 00:51:33,470
You think that's wise, Max?

432
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:50,820
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Private property! You're trespassing!

433
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,491
Wait a minute! Stop!

434
00:51:57,494 --> 00:52:01,081
Let's have a truce for a second
Truce! Truce!

435
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,508
What's this all about?

436
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:19,972
Did you say my mother gave you a hand job?
Did you say it?

437
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:25,811
Who told you that goddamn lie?
Never mind. I know who said that

438
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:30,478
- And I'm going to stick a knife in his heart
And I'm going to send him back to Ireland in abodybag
- He's from Scotland

439
00:52:30,508 --> 00:52:38,479
Well, tell that stupid mick
he just made my list of things to do today
I'm going to pop a cap in hisass

440
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:43,579
So you received the package?

441
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:50,086
Good. I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on

442
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:58,594
- I never took you for an informer, Max
- What's that suppose to mean?

443
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:09,312
She resigned this morning
Before I even got your little snapshots
So your latest attempt at sabotagehas backfired

444
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:13,774
- But she's one of the best teachers you've got
How could you let her go?
- Why are you trying toget her fired?

445
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,069
You stupid old fool!
I'm trying to win her back!

446
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:36,161
Miss Cross?

447
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:37,629
Hi, Max

448
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,973
- You need any help?
- No. I have it. Damn it!

449
00:53:47,848 --> 00:53:51,978
- Here. Let me see
- No. Please, I don't think you should come in here

450
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:57,815
Look. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings

451
00:53:57,823 --> 00:54:02,353
I'm sorry I love your friend instead of you
But... Please, Max

452
00:54:02,946 --> 00:54:07,200
- You honestly believe you love Blume instead of me?
- Yes

453
00:54:07,384 --> 00:54:10,328
You'll forgive me if I won't take your word for that

454
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:13,998
If you don't stop, I'm going to lose it
I mean it!

455
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,826
It's too late

456
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:23,757
Wait, please

457
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:32,585
- I got kicked out because of you!
- You got kicked out because...

458
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:38,563
- Rushmore was my life. Now you are!
- No, I'm not

459
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:45,378
What do you really think is going to happen between us?
You think we're going to have sex?

460
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:54,328
That's kind of a cheap way to put it, don't you think?
- Not if you've never fucked before, it isn't

461
00:54:57,499 --> 00:54:59,187
Oh, my God

462
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:05,587
How would you describe it to your friends?
Would you say that you fingered me?

463
00:55:05,587 --> 00:55:09,050
Or maybe I could give you a hand job
Would that put an end to all of this?

464
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:14,188
Please. Get out of my classroom

465
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:26,488
- Fischer, ya spotty fucker!
- Hey, Magnus

466
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:29,089
Got any hand jobs lately?

467
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:42,124
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here. Your stepfather!
Waitin' for your mum so he can get a piece

468
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,047
Your mind is as warped as your ear, Buchan

469
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,718
Don't get nasty, brother

470
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:15,955
We got him, Dirk. We got him

471
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:34,975
Max?

472
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,144
Hi, Mr. Blume

473
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:44,516
You wanted to meet?

474
00:56:44,892 --> 00:56:51,193
- When?
- Right now. You said you wanted to put an end to this

475
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:57,905
Oh. Yeah. I was going to try and
have that tree over there fall on you

476
00:56:58,405 --> 00:57:04,036
That big one? That would have flat me like pancake

477
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:11,250
- What stopped you?
- What's the point? She loves you

478
00:57:25,973 --> 00:57:32,496
- She's my Rushmore, Max
- Yeah, I know. She was mine, too

00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:58,536
- Good night, Stan. Merry Christmas!
- See you next time

483
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:09,629
It's been nice having your company
here at the shop, Max

484
01:00:10,088 --> 01:00:14,800
Have you put anymore thought into
giving school another shot?

485
01:00:17,011 --> 01:00:23,969
Max, I like being a barber. I'm good at it
But I always thought you'd try another line of work

486
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:30,315
- You talked about being a senator or a diplomat
- Pipe dreams, dad

487
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:34,320
I'm a barber's son

488
01:00:37,906 --> 01:00:40,106
See you at dinner

489
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:03,722
- Hello, Dirk
-Hi, Max

490
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:09,508
- What can I do for you?
- I thought I might get a haircut
- We are closed

491
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:15,776
Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
I threw rocks at you the other day
But I guess I should gonow

492
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,910
Merry Christmas

493
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:29,581
What in the hell is that?

494
01:01:46,972 --> 01:01:53,102
- So did you heard the news?
- I doubt it. I don't really follow the news anymore

495
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:59,691
- Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke
- I'll send him a box of candy

496
01:02:00,234 --> 01:02:02,695
Maybe you ought to go visit him

497
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:16,376
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in

498
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,591
It's so good to see you

499
01:02:26,094 --> 01:02:30,639
These are glorious
Let me put them in some water. Have a sit

500
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:36,645
- Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim?
Or can he not hear me?
-No, he can hear you

501
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:47,563
Hello, old timer. It's Max Fischer

502
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:56,370
- You probably can hear me because
I don't know if your brain is damaged so...
- What do you want?

503
01:03:00,501 --> 01:03:02,515
Nelson?

504
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:11,803
- It's the first thing he said in 10 days

505
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:18,519
- Do you think he recognized me?
- No, I don't think so

506
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,706
Hey, amigo

507
01:03:45,694 --> 01:03:47,617
So who gave you the shiner?

508
01:03:48,964 --> 01:03:53,968
Either Ronny or Donny.
But I can't tell the difference anymore

509
01:03:55,262 --> 01:03:58,472
Whichever one it was, it clocked you

510
01:03:59,557 --> 01:04:05,353
- Kids don't like their parents to get divorced
- I don't blame 'em
- Neither do I

511
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:24,519
- How is she?
- I really don't know

512
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:27,341
- Why not?
- I don't see her in 6 weeks

513
01:04:28,418 --> 01:04:30,796
What happened?

514
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,520
She left?

515
01:04:34,715 --> 01:04:39,520
- She's in love with the dead guy, anyway
- Edward Appleby

516
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:48,144
She's fucked up

517
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:55,693
- Adios, amigo
- Hey, you ok?

518
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:01,574
I'm a little bit lonely these days

519
01:05:33,187 --> 01:05:34,730
Max?

520
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:38,485
What are you doing here?

521
01:05:39,652 --> 01:05:44,031
- I don't know. Jesus!
They came at me out of no where. It was so sudden
- What?

522
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:48,495
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?
I just got hit by a car

523
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:51,247
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

524
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:55,209
- What did you say?
- Come inside

525

<SYNC start=3961063>

526
01:06:07,428 --> 01:06:12,600
- So this is where it all happens?
- Oh, what happens?
- I wouldn't know

527
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:18,523
- So why'd you dump Blume?
- That's none of your business

528
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:23,736
I know it's not. But I was just hit by a car
I'm a little confused right now

529
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:28,824
- I mean. I thought you dumped me for Blume
- I never dumped you because we were never going out

530
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:32,952
Because it would help me
if you would talk to me for a minute.
And tell me what happened

531
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:48,761
Well. A: He's a married man
B: He hates himself

532
01:06:49,302 --> 01:06:56,792
- And C: He smashed your bicycle, didn't he?
- My previous bicycle. Yes

533
01:06:57,184 --> 01:07:01,939
- Well, what sort of person does something like that?
- I don't know

534
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:07,229
War does funny things to men

535
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:12,450
He thinks you dumped him because of Edward Appleby

536
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:16,577
What does that mean?

537
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:20,332
Well, I mean. You live in this room

538
01:07:20,665 --> 01:07:23,919
With all his stuff. It's kind of...

539
01:07:25,252 --> 01:07:29,132
- I was married to him
- I know you

540
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:41,231
I will say Edward has more spark and character
and imagination in one fingernail than
Herman Blumehas in his entire body

541
01:07:42,831 --> 01:07:45,089
One dead fingernail

542
01:07:49,902 --> 01:07:53,412
Right. One dead fingernail

543
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:00,870
How'd he die by the way?

544
01:08:01,746 --> 01:08:04,498
He drowned

545
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:08,919
- How'd your mother die?
- She got cancer

546
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:17,178
Hold still for a minute, ok?

547
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:28,688
- You're very pretty
- Thank you

548
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,745
Is this fake blood?

549
01:08:56,035 --> 01:08:58,050
Yes, it is

550
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:06,390
You know, you and Herman deserve each other
You both are little children

551
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,102

01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:56,313
Hey, I have a, I'm sorry about what I said
about your mom giving me a handjob

555
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,780
I know, Max. Sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass

556
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:07,867
Hey, it's ok

557
01:10:13,288 --> 01:10:15,373
What's that?

558
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:20,129
I don't know

559
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,269
Nice landing

560
01:10:40,356 --> 01:10:44,485
What's that you got there?
A flight plan or something?

561
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:50,990
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so
- Dirk, this is Margaret Yang

562
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:05,295
I heard about your science fair project on Action 13
They said the Navy was going to buy it from you

563
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:08,195
- No, not anymore
- Why not?

564
01:11:08,195 --> 01:11:10,551
- Because it was fake
- What do you mean?

565
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:17,182
- I faked all the results
- Why?
- Because it didn't work. I thought it would but it didn't

566
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:28,277
You were a real jerk to me. You know that?

567
01:11:29,904 --> 01:11:32,363
Sorry, Margaret

568
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:37,326

What's this?

575
01:13:34,064 --> 01:13:40,152
That's the Perfect Attendance awards
and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore

576
01:13:40,444 --> 01:13:46,409
I thought you could choose which one you like more
and you could wear that one and I could wear theother

577
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:51,747
I'll take punctuality

578

Come here

Well, Well. Well...
Look what the cat dragged in

01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,606
- Sorry, I'm late
- That's OK

582
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:26,321
I want you to meet somebody
Mr. Blume, this is my father, Bert Fischer

583
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:34,620
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fischer
Mr. Fischer was my father's name. Call me Bert

584
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:42,295
So Max tells me you need a haircut
I want to you sit down

585
01:14:51,929 --> 01:14:59,556
- I don't know, Bert
- Don't worry, Mr. Blume. It's a painless procedure
Maybe we throw in a shaveas well

586
01:15:02,522 --> 01:15:06,951
Are you fine with that mustache?
Do you wanna keep it for a while?

587
01:15:10,321 --> 01:15:12,556
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know

588
01:15:12,556 --> 01:15:14,701
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so

589
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:18,664
- Good, good
- Why?
- Cause we're going to need all of it

It doesn't look good

Ah, shit! What am I doing here?

596
01:16:41,075 --> 01:16:45,955
How the hell did you ever get so rich?
You're a quitter, man!

597
01:16:46,998 --> 01:16:49,999
I paid eight million dollars

598
01:16:52,086 --> 01:16:54,562
And that's all you're prepared to spend?

599
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:06,846
I'm sorry you couldn't make it
to the little ground-breaking the other day

600
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:10,402
It's kind of a shame, since he's building it for you

601
01:17:12,563 --> 01:17:16,316
I never asked anybody to build me an aquarium

602
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:20,780
- I'm not sure how that rumor got started
- Me, neither

603
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:29,287
- You think Edward Appleby would've built you one?
- Yeah. He probably would've if he had the money

604
01:17:29,663 --> 01:17:35,210
That's what I thought. Blume's got a little more
spark and vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

605
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:40,465
- But the aquarium was your idea
- Well, I gave it to my friend

606
01:17:42,507 --> 01:17:45,507
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please

607
01:17:45,507 --> 01:17:49,347
Could you make the order out to Ready Demolition?

608
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:54,062
Thank you very much

609
01:17:58,691 --> 01:18:01,151

- Will you stick it up your mother's arse, ya little prick?

616
01:18:47,028 --> 01:18:52,950
I've got to hand it to you, Magnus.
You've got a way with words. You want to be in a play?

And to Edward Appleby. A friend of a friend

Also you'll find a pair of safety glasses

641
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:42,336
I'm OK! Go, go, go, go!

642
01:22:42,837 --> 01:22:47,467
- Take it easy, Dirk
- How much time we got, Wood?

643
01:22:47,758 --> 01:22:52,154
- Bring me some more ketchup very quickly, please
- This is gonna look stupid
- No, it's not. It'sgonna look real

644
01:23:10,405 --> 01:23:15,202
- Thank you
- You're welcome. Hold this one, too. OK?

645
01:23:19,454 --> 01:23:24,127
So what do you think of Max's latest opus?

646
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:26,211
It's good

647
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,801
It's got a happy ending

648
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:57,117
- Adios, Esposito
- Adios, Sarge. Say a prayer for Surf Boy

649
01:23:58,869 --> 01:24:01,829
Semper fi(Good luck), soldier
Semper fi

Sic transit gloria
Maybe we'll meet someday when the fighting stops

651
01:24:13,422 --> 01:24:15,385
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out!

652
01:24:31,607 --> 01:24:33,819
Hello, Esposito

653
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:43,159
- Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?
- You bet I will

654
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
<SYNC start=5101462>

655
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:18,891
- Did Max send you an invitation?
- Yeah. And he told me to wear a tie

656
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:24,074
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thanks you very much, Mrs. Yang

657
01:25:24,617 --> 01:25:28,592
I wrote a different version of the play two years ago

658
01:25:28,592 --> 01:25:32,374
- But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore
- Oh, really? why?

659
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:37,377
- No. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals
- A very good evening to you, Fishers

660
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:41,925
Miss Cross, I'd like you to meet
my father, Bert Fischer. He's a barber

661
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:46,679
- This is my friend Rosemary Cross
- Hello, Rosemary

662
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:53,311
And, of course, you know Mr. Blume
I'd also like everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang
And this isMargaret

663
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:59,900
I'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage
It's clearly a safety hazard

664
01:26:00,151 --> 01:26:05,113
- Last year he tried to raise piranhas
- Yeah, I know he did that
What'd you think, Mr. Littlejeans?

665
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:07,994
Best play ever, man

666
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:14,663
- I thought I was very realistic performancer
- Yeah? Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' line

667
01:26:14,913 --> 01:26:19,336
- I didn't notice
- How are Ronny and Donny doing in military school?

668
01:26:19,503 --> 01:26:22,005
- They love it
- Lucky Bastards

669
01:26:22,546 --> 01:26:28,884
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon
- No. I'm a barber. But a lot of people make that mistake

670
01:26:34,766 --> 01:26:39,688
- You were incredible tonight, Margaret
You were that poor girl
- Thank you

671
01:26:40,021 --> 01:26:45,276
- I loved it when you grabbed onto
the bottom of the chopper as it was taking off
- That was totallyimprovised

672
01:26:46,151 --> 01:26:50,364
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course
- Can you do an Australian accent?

673
01:26:50,697 --> 01:26:52,897
I'm working on something that's set in the outback

674
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:55,828
I really feel like celebrating, you know

675
01:26:55,828 --> 01:27:00,165
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes. I'd love to

676
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:07,548
- You're looking good, Bert
- Hello, Mr. Blume
- Hello, Margaret

677
01:27:07,756 --> 01:27:12,928
May I cut in? I haven't had a change to
cut a rug with your new girlfriend yet

678
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:19,433
Yes, I am. Find your own partner, Mr. Blume
I'm spoken for

679
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:23,229
No, it's OK. He's my friend

680
01:27:29,026 --> 01:27:35,783
- Well, you pulled it off
- It went OK. At least nobody got hurt

681
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:39,599
Except for you

682
01:27:41,204 --> 01:27:44,125
No. I didn't get hurt that bad

683
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,002
Come on, you two. Shake a leg

684
01:27:49,879 --> 01:27:51,879
You you like to dance?

685
01:27:51,879 --> 01:27:55,960
Yeah, but let's see if we DJ can play
something with a little more...
