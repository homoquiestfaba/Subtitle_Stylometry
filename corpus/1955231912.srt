<b>getting my butthole refinished.</b>

499
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,035
<b>[ Laughter ]</b> <b>It was
very expensive.</b>

500
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,904
<b>So when I read</b> <b>in</b><b><i>The
New York Times</i></b>

501
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,840
<b>that labiaplasties are
becoming</b> <b>increasingly popular,</b>

502
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,376
<b>especially among teens,</b>
<b>I was not surprised.</b>

503
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,545
<b>I had so many questions</b>
<b>about labiaplasty,</b>

504
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,513
<b>so I sat down</b> <b>with Dr.
Jennifer Berman</b>

505
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,216
<b>to learn all about</b>
<b>designer vaginers.</b>

506
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,419
<b>Dr. Berman, why would a
woman</b> <b>get labiaplasty?</b>

507
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:05,491
<b>Labiaplasty means removal</b> <b>of
excess skin in the labia.</b> <b>Okay.</b>

508
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,792
<b>And if there is a redundancy,</b>

509
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,361
<b>meaning length...</b>
<b>increased length...</b>

510
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,529
<b>Redundancy... I like that,</b>
<b>where you're just like,</b>

511
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,631
<b>"Okay, I get it, vagina."</b>

512
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,898
<b>On and on and on and on.</b>

513
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,800
<b>And if it interferes</b>
<b>with sexual relations</b>

514
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,535
<b>or it's irritating</b>
<b>when they exercise,</b>

515
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,270
<b>you know,</b> <b>those would be...</b>
<b>Right.</b>

516
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,640
<b>Have you noticed a trend in more</b>
<b>women getting labiaplasties?</b>

517
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,709
<b>I've noticed a trend</b> <b>in more
people talking about it,</b>

518
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:27,446
<b>extremely self-conscious</b>
<b>about their genital areas.</b>

519
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,748
<b>I'm one of those women</b>

520
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,217
<b>who have definitely started</b>
<b>talking about it more</b>

521
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,718
<b>because I would look at porn,</b>

522
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,720
<b>which, of course,</b>
<b>they're all, like,</b>

523
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,456
<b>these tiny, little God's</b>
<b>little whisper of a vagina,</b>

524
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,791
<b>and I would see
that,</b> <b>and I'd say,</b>

525
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,326
<b>"Oh, I guess that's</b>
<b>what everyone wants."</b>

526
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,795
<b>You hear guys...</b> <b>"Oh,
roast beef sandwich.</b>

00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,697
<b>You look like... "</b> <b>You just go,</b>

<b>"[ Laughs ]</b> <b>That must be gross."</b>

529
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,068
<b>And then you're like,</b>
<b>"I'm disgusting."</b>

530
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,070
<b>What's driving</b>
<b>women's insecurity</b>

531
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,506
<b>is that we think</b> <b>men
think it's beautiful.</b>

532
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,940
<b>Like, I feel like this,</b>

533
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,610
<b>it's like, they stick
out,</b> <b>like, that much.</b>

534
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,279
<b>Well, that's...</b> <b>I could pull
them out</b> <b>like to here probably.</b>

535
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,447
<b>That's normal.</b>

536
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,415
<b>That is?</b> <b>Yeah.</b>

537
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,016
<b>It's like a little, like...</b>

538
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,486
<b>You know like a little dog's</b>
<b>soft little tongue peeking out?</b>

539
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,021
<b>It's almost like...</b>
<b>All right, I get it.</b>

540
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,257
<b>All right, so,</b>
<b>there's a little bit</b>

541
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,025
<b>of what we call "labial show,"</b>

542
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,894
<b>which</b> <b>is what you're describing.</b>
<b>Ooh! I...</b>

543
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,263
<b>That's gonna be</b>
<b>my Broadway play.</b>

544
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,464
<b>Labial Show.</b>

545
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,899
<b>You did it.</b> <b>You named it for me.</b>

546
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,202
<b>So, there's sexual sensations</b>
<b>that are in that area.</b>

547
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,938
<b>It also adds a little bit</b>
<b>of length to the vagina,</b>

548
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,140
<b>so it kind of grabs</b>
<b>along the outside,</b>

549
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,643
<b>so there's a functional
purpose</b> <b>to the labia.</b>

550
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,311
<b>"Don't let go, dick."</b> <b>[ Laughs ]</b>

551
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,281
<b>It's almost like they're...</b>
<b>a cliffhanger.</b> <b>Yeah.</b>

552
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,882
<b>So, what are</b> <b>some
of the drawbacks</b>

553
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,017
<b>of getting labiaplasty?</b>

554
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,286
<b>I've seen some majorly
botched</b> <b>labiaplasties.</b>

555
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,454
<b>Really?</b> <b>Yes.</b>

556
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,056
<b>Changing it, mutilating
it,</b> <b>even, to some degree.</b>

557
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,058
<b>So you shouldn't just
get it</b> <b>willy-nilly.</b>

558
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,661
<b>You certainly shouldn't do it</b>
<b>just for cosmetic reasons.</b>

559
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,796
<b>I'm leaving</b> <b>this
conversation feeling, like,</b>

560
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,999
<b>I love it, and I just</b>
<b>want to spread the love.</b>

561
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,300
