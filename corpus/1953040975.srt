she's got a wedding ring, no husband.

the husband's around.

with the building

were any guests

You know, her other
slipper's up here. Yeah?

15
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,686
Well, I'm just saying,
it's improbable

16
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,411
that somebody would wanna walk
down the stairs with one slipper.

She's disoriented, you know?

19
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,401
There's only one point of
impact and it's severe enough

20
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,087
that she fell from a 12foot height,
not rolling down the stairs.

is what I've been told.

It's unavoidable, yes.

51
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,728
We're so sorry for the... Yes.

52
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,401
It is a disturbance. You're...

53
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,130
Yup. Thank you.

54
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm sorry.
What were you asking me?

55
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,046
You were saying that you've never
met the tenant who lives across...

56
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,441
No. No, no, I haven't.
I've been here now...

It's been 11 years. Oh, my.

58
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,969
She was in the apartment before I
arrived, yes, so we've never met.

59
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,520
In 11 years, you've never had any
interaction with her personally?

60
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,965

<i>Yeah, so, in that sense, we
have had communication, yes.</i>

you to come into the station...

Really? ...after you get off.
What time will that be?

We can do this one of two ways.

You can let me in now and
I'll make it short and sweet

83
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,400
or I'll come back later with a
warrant and a bunch of other guys.

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,087
And from what I understand,
you won't like that too much.

85
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,131

I'll get awarrant.

I'm gonna come in here for a second.

93

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,251
Look, nobody's in trouble.
I'm just following protocol.

95
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,651
I just needed a few
minutes of your time.

96
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,531
You live right across
the hall from her.

97
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,726
Right.

98
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,606
Wow, this is a really
beautiful apartment you have.

99
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,361
Is that what they teach
you in detective school?

100
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,081
Charm me with false praise and then
we're sitting down for coffee?

101
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,721
Well, if you're offering, you know,
I'd love a cup of coffee. I...

102
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,609
I got here at 6:00
in the morning.

103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,728

Yes.

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,410
Are you expecting
somebody at this hour?

108
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,006
I imagine that you already
know the answer to that one.

109
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,885
Okay, you got me.
That was dishonest. I... Uh...

110
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,691
I was just trying
to break the ice.

111
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,560
Yeah, well, I'm not interested in
breaking ice or engaging in small talk,

112
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,210
so I'd very much
like it if you would

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,851
just get to the
point so that I can

114
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,410
get on with my morning.

115
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,725
So no coffee?

116
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,006
How long have you lived here?

117
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,326
You wanted to talk to
me about my neighbor?

118
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,925
Thank you. Uh...

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,490
Yeah, that's right.

120
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,289
This is really nice.

121
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,285
She was old

122
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,570
and it's my understanding she
was sick for quite a while.

123
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,846
I don't know.

124
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,684
Well, from what I
put together, uh,

125
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,888
she was feeling a lot better.

126
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,721
You know, she liked to take the
stairs instead of the elevator.

127
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,724
She preferred to walk
instead of taking a cab.

128
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,521
Hmm. Well, if you say so.

129
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,285
So, your concierge says that you
don't like to get out that much.

130
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,885
I suppose so.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,046
Are you... Uh...

132
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,810
What is that? Um...

133
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,605
Agoraphobia?

134
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,045
Well, if you insist.

135
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,408
No, no offense.
You know, I suffer from arachnophobia.

136
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,081
Really?

137
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,161
Mmm-hmm.

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,049
Yeah. That's a fear of spiders.

139
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,166

full of tarantulas right now.

141
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,051
You're pretty witty for a lady
that doesn't get out that much.

142
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,726
Are you here to talk
about me or Hilary?

143
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,161
Hilary?

144
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,766
That was her name.

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,206
But I thought you
didn't know her at all.

146
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,770
No, Detective, I did not.

147
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,360
So why would you call her by her first
name if you didn't know her at all?

148
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,602
All right. Are we done yet?

149
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,008
No. Just a few more minutes.

150
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,487
Um, over the last couple
of days or weeks,

151
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,209
were there any strange visitors

152
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,123
or anything out of the ordinary

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,729
that you were aware of
coming from the apartment?

154
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,843
No strange sounds last
night when she died?

155
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,969
Since I don't know when
she died, day or night,

156
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,361
and since I've already
made it clear

157
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,367
that I didn't hear anything out of the
ordinary coming from her apartment,

158
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,323
then I'd venture to guess
that we are entering

159
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,090
into an area of...
Hmm, redundancy?

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,286
Okay, now we're done.

161
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,170
Thank you for the coffee.
I'm gonna give you a couple of cards.

162
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,490
If you think of
anything, uh, call me.

163
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,684
Thank you.I will.

164
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,921
Okay.

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,729

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,167
It's a little confusing,
but it's nice.

167

figure it out.

17 years ago this month.</i>

175
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,403

summer cottage in upstate New York.</i>

176

is being filmed</i>

177
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,890

178
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,329

record of 14 straight hours.</i>

179

on Justine's whereabouts.</i>

180
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,125
<i>Theories range from her running
off with a Saudi prince</i>

181
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,009
<i>to her being a victim
of foul play.</i>

182
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,488
<i>Now while the great and
powerful Phillip Waters</i>

183
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,483
<i>claimed until his
death five years ago</i>

184
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,449

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,968
<i>In the days leading up to what would
become her historic vanishing act,</i>

188
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,681
<i>it was rumored that
18 year-old Justine Waters</i>

189
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,845
<i>had just become engaged to Prince
Achmed Mustafi of Jordan.</i>

you could help me identify

194
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,080
this crest?

195
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,963
Interesting. Yeah? Why is that?

196
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,884
Well, this could
be a family crest.

197
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,482
This is the letter "M", correct?

198
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,006
Well, that was the intention.
The drawing is rough, but...

199
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,048
(LAUGHS) Well, where'd
you find this?

200
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,329
I can't really tell you.
I just need to find out what it is.

201
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,808
Okay. I got a book in the back,

202
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,769
something of an
almanac, so to speak.

203
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,410
Might be able to find a match.

204
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,722
How long do you think...
Oh, one second. (PHONE RINGING)

205
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,801

might interest you

210
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,881
are some prescription

212
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,167

who the doctor is?

213
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,971

And we are getting another

232

238
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,883
They rented the apartment!

239
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,566
How could this have happened?

240
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,489

241

is simply outrageous.

242
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,962
They haven't returned any
of my phone calls, either.

243
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,042
Is there anything we
can do to stop this?

244
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,129
I will look into it immediately.

245
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,281

You know, the police were here.
In my home.

251
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,042
Of course the police
were here, Abby.

252
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,121
And that doesn't bother you?

253
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,771
The police were here
because Hilary died.

254
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,003
She had a fall and they're
investigating her death.

255
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,924
You live across the hall, so of
course they're gonna inquire

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,809
if you heard
anything suspicious.

257
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,487
Once they deduce that her death was an
accident, which it most certainly was,

258
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,770
they'll have no need to
bother you any further.

259
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,409
One of the detectives
left me his card.

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,607
Oh.

261
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,170
Ray, how many wallets have I
bought you through the years?

262
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,651
Abigail, I'm attached to this.

263
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,610
It was a gift from your mother on
my first day of medical school.

264
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,569
I'll never part with it.

265
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,928
It's just that I don't
want things to change.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,207
Okay? I just need
things to stay the same

267
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,248
I just need things to continue...
Abby, Abby.

268
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,926
As they have been.
This is a disruption.

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,163
Well, if change is
what you don't want,

270
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,841
I strongly advise that
you stop inquiring

271
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,843
about the apartment
across the hall.

272
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,249
And it's sort of academic.
The apartment is leased.

273
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,241
And they're gonna lead their
lives just as Hilary led hers.

somewhere or something.

now that you've helped her

00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,087
No, sir. No, sir, not at all.
I was just trying to help with...

524
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,207
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Let me help.

525
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,281
Oh, good.

526
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,124
This... I shouldn't see that.

527
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,328
It's fine. Okay. All right.
I'll get the elevator.

528
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,129
(MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)

529
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,201
There we are.

530
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,805
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to help.

531
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,291
Don't worry about it.
There were just so many bags.

532
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,486
I didn't realize... It's fine.

533
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,370
It's not all for me.
I bought you a new tie.

534
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,046
A new tie?

535
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,609
A new tie? Yeah A new tie.

536
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,127
KLANDERMANN: Right here, sir?

537
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,880
On the counter, please. Uh! huh!

538
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,167
Excuse me, sorry.

539
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,241
Thank you.

541
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,805
Everything all right,
Klandermann?

542
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,245
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

543
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,526
Well, no.

544
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,240
That's...

545
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,487
That's where I found her.

546
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,330
CHARLIE: Found who?

547
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,845
Mrs.
Lonnigan, the previous tenant.

548
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,166
What do you mean?
Well, that's...

549
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,402
I was the one that found her.
Right here.

550
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,731
They said she fell
down the stairs.

551
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,124
I didn't know that.

552
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,884
She was such a sweet old
lady, too, you know?

553
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,200
Everybody loved her
in the building.

554
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,370
Always had something
sweet to say

555
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,965
and always made everybody smile.

556
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,565
The whole building
loved her, really.

557
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,130
That's so sad.

558
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,202
I'd just never seen
anybody die before.

559
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,161
What do you mean?

560
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,086
She wasn't dead yet
when I found her. No.

561
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,130
We got a call, the tenant
down below, Henderson,

562
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,971
they heard a real loud...

563
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,850
And I raced to...
And the door was unlocked,

564
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,209
which is quite unusual for a building
like this, I'll tell you that.

565
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,443
But it seemed as if she
were still trying to speak.

566
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,725
What was she trying to say?

567
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,245
Oh, I have no idea.

568
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,728
See, I'd never seen
anything and there she...

569
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,441
It was awful, so it's all
kind of a blur now, you know.

570
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,329
CHARLIE: Yeah.
Yeah, that's a shame.

571
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,641
I mean, I have an idea
I shouldn't say that.

572
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,609
I haven't told anybody this
before, but when I found her

573
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,890
it sounded like she was
trying to say, uh, "Why?"

574
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,721
"Why?"

575
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,404
But it was a "Why me?"

576
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,131
"Why did this happen to me?"
kind of "why." Does that make

577
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,691
any, uh...

578
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,527
(EXHALES)

579
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,289
I'm so sorry.
I should not be here.

580
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,089
I'm so sorry to
take up your time.

581
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,004
Do you need any help unloading
these bags at all or...

582
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,650
I'll remember how I
know you, Mr. Stanford.

583
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,245
I swear I will.
I'm so sorry I haven't.

584
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,561
All right, let me
know when you do.

585
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,641
Sure thing.

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,524
LILLIAN: What was that about?

587
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,969
CHARLIE: He thinks he knows me.

588
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,165
Does he?

589
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,321
I don't think so.

590
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,601
Hi. Sorry.

591
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,284
This, um... From...

592
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,401
You're good?

593
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,725
Thank you. Okay.

(ABIGAIL READING)

595
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,887
Before you moved around, you were
just in Bakersfield that whole time?

596
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,450
Bakersfield, California.

597
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,320
My mom drank, mostly to
get away from my father,

598
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,001
who also drank.

599
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,041
Hmm.

600
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,963
Was he abusive? Yeah.

601
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,042
That's pretty much why I left,

602
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,565
because I couldn't take it any more.
I was 15

603
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,525
and I had $7.20 to my name.

604
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,762
And I had fallen in
love with Charlie

605
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,843
and he's pretty much
just taken care of me.

606
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,484
I couldn't...

607
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,608
I couldn't stay with
someone who hurt me.

608
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,809
I mean, we have a good time,
but I don't really...

609
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,890
I wouldn't really have
anything without him

610
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,651
I just couldn't do it.

611
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,684
So what's the alternative?

612
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,561
Would you like some more wine?

613
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,290
Yes, please.

614
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,930
So where's your family?

615
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,331
My mom died.

616
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,046
And your father?

617
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,250
He's dead, too.

618
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,407
Oh.

619
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,443
Were you close with them?

620
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,005
I was close with my mother.

621
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,721
Mmm-hmm.

00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,286
My dad...

623
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,249
My dad drank as well

624
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,483
and he'd fly off the handle.
He'd go into these rages.

625
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,049
And he would beat
my mother and me

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,566
when I tried to protect her.

627
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,606
Mmm-hmm.

628
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,681
Hmm.

629
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,047

control anything.

Haven't I always
been there for you?

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,287
My father had a friend.

643
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,443
My father had a friend and he
knew how bad my father could be

644
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,729
and what he was capable
of, so he helped me to...

You know, I didn't
intentionally...

647
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,085
I didn't set out intentionally.

She did have tendencies to push herself.
