329
00:43:58,119 --> 00:43:59,139
You're hurting me Mason.

Now stop the engine by pressing
the red button to go right

366
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:27,989
lt is too much.

367
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,425
What the hell is going on?

368
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:45,638
Slow down, okay?

369
00:49:45,585 --> 00:49:47,245
We have to keep a low profile on this.

370
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,098
Low profile? Mason is on this train.

371
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:51,797

We're screwed man,
everybody is getting sick at once.

377
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:12,364
Just shut up, you're not the
only one scaring your pal

378
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:18,789
Terrorism plus sickness,
equal biologial war

379
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:20,625
Sir.

380
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,685

l can't help these people if you
keep riding them up.

386
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:36,463
Maybe we should all remain
calm then

387
00:50:36,947 --> 00:50:40,579
Cos pretty similar we are all knocking
at the fucking gates

388
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,881

00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:54,103
You want to go out on your own?

390
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:58,229
Fine.
You're on your own.

391
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,612

Vincent, we're not stopping

400
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:39,488
Kill them, get all the money.

401
00:51:39,712 --> 00:51:41,573
We got the wall hiding.

402
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:01,199
Slow down.

444
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:42,214
My god, do you have the viles?

445
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,424
l've done everything l can to get them.

446
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:52,001
Unless you recover it,
and stop this train.

447
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,452
l'm in the proceeding sir.

448
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:13,939
We got to clear the track now,

00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:14,841
Yes sir,

450
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:16,769
And call the world health organisation

451
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:52,236
He's up here.

452
00:59:52,331 --> 00:59:53,261
Kill him!

453
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:40,518
Are you okay?

454
01:00:40,488 --> 01:00:41,688
Yeah, l'm okay.

455
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:43,398
Do you know what's going
on round here?

456
01:00:43,953 --> 01:00:45,044
l'm not sure.

457
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,919
Everyone is sick at the
same time but...

458
01:00:56,506 --> 01:00:58,265
l think it might be smallpox.

459
01:00:58,644 --> 01:00:59,585
Smallpox?

460
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,311
Wasn't that wiped out?

461
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,592
ln 1973,

462
01:01:35,507 --> 01:01:36,508
Christop is dead.

463
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:38,128
Are you sure?

464
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:44,168
Yeah, l pushed him out of the
train out of his cycle.

465
01:01:44,597 --> 01:01:46,226
No way he could survive.

466
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:47,519
You better be right.

467
01:01:47,733 --> 01:01:48,704
What about Corina?

468
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:50,046
No sign.

469
01:01:50,238 --> 01:01:51,829
l need those vaccine in me.

470
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:18,822
l'll be down into my nicker soon.
The young one is gonna suffer.

471
01:02:24,816 --> 01:02:26,147
You can cover yourself up if you want.

472
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:31,109
Most countries still denotculating
small pox in 1979

473
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:32,439
We have our shots.

474
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:35,372
So our system still have the
traces of the vaccine

475
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:38,288
But any point after that have
absolutely no protection.

476
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:40,695
Are you saying we're safe,
we can't get it

477
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:42,343
No, no, no, no.

478
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:45,294

01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:02,885
No, get ice.

482
01:03:05,584 --> 01:03:06,885
You need to go and help her.

483
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:08,302
l can't go.

484
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:09,565
You need to help me.

485
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:10,989
l'm afraid.

486
01:03:11,476 --> 01:03:13,837
Come on.

487
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:36,804
No, no, no

488
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:47,787
Come in...

489
01:03:50,449 --> 01:03:51,500
What's going on?

490
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,755
Mum...

491
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:38,484
Let me of of here, there must be
some one on this train

492
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:42,218
You're wasting bullet.

493
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,068
Give me now!

494
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:08,825
Help me stop this train.

495
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:16,782
The engine is on fire.

496
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:20,047
Get out of there!

497
01:05:20,392 --> 01:05:20,982
Yeah.

498
01:05:21,773 --> 01:05:25,175
Happy birthday Christop.

499
01:05:30,286 --> 01:05:36,060
You got 2 minutes,

01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:52,664
l swear to god, l'll shoot you.

503
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:54,148
You got the vile.

504
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:57,390
l'll kill you!

505
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:58,250
You're sick.

506
01:05:58,856 --> 01:06:01,878
lf you had let me go.
Everything would be okay.

507
01:06:01,928 --> 01:06:02,859
l would be fine.

508

Listen, with the viles,
We can cure you and everybody esle

509
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,198

l'm gonna make things right.

513
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:42,738
What's going on?

514
01:06:42,983 --> 01:06:45,214
The drunken moron, hasn't stop.

515
01:06:47,973 --> 01:06:49,374
Stop the train!

516
01:06:49,836 --> 01:06:51,557
There's no way to avoid a collision.

517
01:06:54,797 --> 01:06:56,488
Just a few seconds to go.

518
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:09,614
Put that weapon down.

519
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:11,478
Drop the clear.

520
01:07:20,152 --> 01:07:21,381
Let them go.

You let Ethan go.

529
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:49,552
Give it to me first.

530
01:07:56,793 --> 01:07:59,355

538
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:06,941
Be careful.

539
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:32,658
Ethan?

540
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,211

How much are you gonna

What are you talking about?
l don't know what you are talking about

622
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:44,621
No, l'm thinking clearly.

And explain to me how Mason knew
which compartment you booked us in

630
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,828
You're dislusional, you're delusional.

01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:12,005
Delusion is...

632
01:20:15,879 --> 01:20:16,750
