Need some more picks
and shovels in here!

Do you see this?
Come here! Come here!

[Man]
Where are you going, Raoul?

9
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,243
You must come to the mine
for the celebration.

[Man]
It is very selfish of you
to steal from me.

13
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,219
Yes?Yes.

14
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,570
After all,
did I not promise to share
the treasure of the temple

15
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,485
with the whole town?

16
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:32,315
Do not kill me, Señor Diaz.
I beg you.

17
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,321
Take the treasure.
Please, just don't kill me.

18
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,236
I'm not going
to kill you, Raoul.

19
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,153
May God bless you.

20
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,372
You are.

21
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,809
Please, Señor Diaz.

22
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,333
I have a wife
and a child.

23
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,726
I can't.

24
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,945

You die alone,
or you can have company.

30
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:14,357

would do if my boy Luis
was being threatened.

This is my gift to you.

Maybe we should stop
at a filling station, Thomas.

51
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,934
Honey, the farther south
of the border you go,

52
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,544
the cheaper the gas.

53
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,937
Oh, for heaven's sake.

54
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,156
I just don't want
to get stuck out here

Good job, Ricky,
you're learning Spanish.

Thank you, prostituta.

60
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,693
What did you just call me?

61
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,390
That's enough.
Will you stop it?

62
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,175
I'm getting a migraine
and you're making it worse.

to learn Mexican, Mom!

He's studying.

Did you hear
what he called me?Not now, Lily.

66
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,052
Listen to your mother.

67
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,359
Why do you always
take his side, Mother?

68
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,927
I think
you know why, Lily.

69
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:33,540
That sign says there's a little
town up the road a piece.

70
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,500
I think we should stop.
We're almost out of gas.

71
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,197
Yeah.

72
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,940
Hey, maybe we should get a room
for the night, you think? Huh?

73
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,639
I'm so tired,
I can barely keep my eyes open.

74
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:49,207
Good. I've seen enough desert
and cactus to last a lifetime.

75
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:54,386
I can't wait to see you
on that beach.

76

Eww.

All right.
Let's unload.

82

I told you so.No, you didn't.

83
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,637
Yeah!That is enough!

You did not!Lily, Lily...

85
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,467
What?Enough. Stop.

Daddy, make him stop!

97
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,737
All right, Ricky,
that's enough.

98
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,043
Now, you're even
giving me a headache.

Did you find anyone?

102
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,009
Well, there's a cleaning lady
in the parlor

103
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,620
and I guess it's her mother
in the dining room

104
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,709
and neither one of them
speak English.

105
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,930
Well, for heaven sakes,
what is wrong with these people?

106
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,584

[continues speaking Spanish,
distorted]

110
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,854
You are not just gonna check
yourself in, Thomas.

111
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,508
You can't do that.

112
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,511
Well, I'm not gonna wait around
for someone to show up

113
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,732
so that we can give 'em
our money, if that's
what you're thinking.

114
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,038
Well, that's strange.

115
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,170
What?

116
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,346
Well, the last person
that signed in

117
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,131
was back in '47.

118
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,699
Well, maybe they don't use
that ledger anymore.

119
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,266
Oh.

120
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,095
You could
get arrested, Thomas.

121
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,707
Really?
Well, I'll tell you what.

122
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:08,406
If we do, we just bribe
the policía.

123
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,496
That's what they do
down here in Mexico, you know.

124
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,107
You're so square, Daddy.

125
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,413
That's so
completely prejudiced.

126
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,502
What?Saying you'll just
bribe the policía.

127
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,722
You wouldn't say that
if we were home.

128
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,768
Not now, Lily.No, it's terribly wrong.

129
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:26,468
Really. I think you owe
all Mexicans an apology.

130
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,730
Really?

131
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,210
Well, I'll tell you what.

132
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,517
If I ever see one,
I'll apologize.

133
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,652
Hey, son.

134
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,436
Follow me.

135
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,613
Up here, I think.

136
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,185
Numero cinco.

137
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,190
You and your brother
are going to share this room.

138
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,497
There's only one bed, Daddy.

139
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,890
I'm 19 years old.

140
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,848
Couldn't you have stolen
another key?

141
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:02,330
Listen, princess,
we're going to have to pay
for these rooms eventually

142
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:06,290
and I'm not going
to pay for three rooms
for a few hours' stay.

143
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,857
It's just too expensive,
and anyway,

144
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,381
we'll be on the road
first thing come sunrise.

145
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,687
Cheapy Señor Cheapstein.

146
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,820
Hey.What did you just
call your father?

147
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:17,737
Just the greatest dad
in the whole wide world.

148
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,870
That's what I thought.
It's time for bed, young man.

149
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,743
We'll see you
in the morning.

150
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,049
Ah, yes.
Number five.

151
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,791
Good night, princess.
Thank you.

152
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:31,054
See you, sport.

153
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,187
Mother, we're here.

154
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,888
I can't believe you talked me
into going to Mexico
for vacation.

155
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,368
With the kids, no less.

156
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:43,458
It's Ricky's first week
out of the hospital, honey,

157
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,852
after beating
that damn polio.

158
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,244
I know. I just--

159
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,769
I wanted it to be special.

160
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,902
It will be. Promise.

161
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,951
So...

162
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,782
The kids are in bed.

163
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,830
Wanna make love?

164
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,451
[loud creaking]

165
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,819
It sounds like there's
someone else in here

166
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,300
and they're even noisier
than you.

167
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,879
I'm gonna take
a bath, Ricky.

168
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,795
I'll be back
in a few minutes.

169
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,615
Oops.

170
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,313
Hmm.

171
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,854
Ahh.

172
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,845

[groans]

174
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,557
How could you come
into the bathroom

175
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,081
when I was taking a bath,
you little brat.

176
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,258
You think you can get away with
anything just because you're...

177
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,785
My diary! How dare you?

178
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,483
Ricky White,
you're horrible.

179
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:05,007
I wish you had died
in that hospital.

180
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,793
[screams]

181
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:10,317
[distorted growling]

182
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,147
Daddy!

183
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,584
[Lily screams]

184
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,371
Señorita!

185
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,940
There's a boy-- a boy upstairs,
who's hurt badly.

186
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,030
Please,
he needs our help!

187
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,814
[screams]

188
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,299
Help me!
Help me, please!

189
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:42,088
[moaning]You have to help me.
There is this woman...

190
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,046
She had an accident.
A small boy--

191
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,571
He just came up and I--

192
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,486
[moaning]

193
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,968
[screams]

194
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,106
[Lily screams]

195
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:07,722
[speaking Spanish]

196
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,071
[Lily screams]

197
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,551
[car horns blaring]

198
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,118
Banana chips.No banana chips.

199
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,815
Nuts, peanuts, almonds...

200
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,295
Um...peanuts.

201
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,644
[laughs]

202
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:18,863
Can I have some more?You're picky.

203
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,213
I am picky.

204
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,866
You're picky.Thanks, babe.

205
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,173
I have to pick out
the fruit for you?You do.

206
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:27,220
You don't like the nuts, you
don't like the banana chips...

207
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,048
Picky!

208
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,050
[laughs]

209
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,660
So, okay.

210
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,054
Are you sure you're right
about this whole thing?

211
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,447
'Cause I don't really do well
with first impressions.

212
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,015
Like when I interviewed
for my college entrance exam,

213
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,583
I spilled iced coffee all over
my interviewer's shirt.

214
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:45,586
And P.S., she was wearing
a white T-shirt, no bra.

215
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,937
Got her to turn on
the headlights, if you
know what I'm saying.

216
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,504
You know,
you will be fine.

217
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,114
Nah.No, they'll love you.

218
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,159
Nah.Yes!

219
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:54,551
Really?Yes.

220
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,206
Well, you love me,
I get that, it's just,

221
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,122
from what you tell me,
your parents are like
really traditional,

222
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,124
you know,
like really old school.

223
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,126
I know their type.
I-I know their type.

224
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,736
They're gonna
be sittin' there thinking,

225
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,130
"No one's ever good enough
for our little girl."

226
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,046
You know? Especially not
a little gringo like me.

227
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,787
Okay, will you just
stop worrying?

228
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,095
Just be yourself and they will
adore you, just like I do, okay?

229
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,271
You do adore me, don't you?Yes, I do.

230
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,186
What do you
adore about me?Everything.

231
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,839
Every little last thing?Yes.

232
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,625
So, where we at, where we going,
where we been, what's going on?

233
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,931
Yeah, um, are we still
on El Camino Real?

234
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,498
I'm gonna have to assume so,

235
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,240
because every road in Mexico
is El Camino Real.

236
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:32,763
El Camino Real.
El Camino Real.

237
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:36,463
Lots of old roads. Why do they
have so many old roads?

238
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,073
No new roads in Mexico?

239
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,770
El Camino Nuevo?

240
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,686
It looks like there's a town
about two miles up the road.

241
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,123
We can stop
and ask there.

242
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,733
Yeah?Yeah.

243
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,952
What? About why everything's
El Camino Real?

244
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,345
[laughs]
No.No?

245
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:52,218
About how to get to my parents'
new ranch from here.

246
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,350
Oh! Right, right.

247
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,657
Yes.
[laughs]

248
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,183
We are never gonna find
a gas station out here.

249
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,229
No kidding.
Not to mention a freaking--

250
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,318
Joss! Joss!Oh, shit!

251
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,929
[car horn blaring]

252
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,547
Are you all right, babe?Yeah. You're bleeding.

253
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,419
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

254
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:22,639
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

255
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,293
Are you okay?

256
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,252
Are you okay, lady?
Oh, my God!

257
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:28,689
[speaking Spanish]What the hell happened to her?

258
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:32,388
Who did this to you?
Who did this to her?
What the fuck's going on?

259
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,042
[speaking Spanish]

260
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,479
Oh, my God, we've got to
get her to a hospital.

261
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:39,178
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

262
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,095
[car engine sputtering]

263
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:54,236
Fuck! I saved up
for a year and a half for
this fuckin' piece of shit!

264
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,238
Joss. Joss,
you'd better come over here.

265
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,501
I have to find
the police or the sheriff

266
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,155
or the magnificent
fucking seven...

267
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,243
Joss!

268
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,201
What?Come here!

269
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,333
What is that?

270
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,769
What does that say?

271
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,510
What--What does that say?

272
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:12,211
"They cut out my tongue
so no one can hear my screams."

273
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,995
[sobbing]

274
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,868
Okay, um,
I'm gonna get the police.

275
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,923
Hola.Uh, hola.

276
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,882
Um, do you, uh--
do you speak Eng--

277
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:35,059
Okay. You, uh,
"speako" English?

278
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,671
"Speako?"

279
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:39,629
Yeah, uh, fuck, do you--

280
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,283
Uh, English...

281
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,285
What seems to be
the trouble, son?

282
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,810
Oh, you do. Okay, good.
Okay, we were in an accident.

283
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,682
Uh, you really gotta help us.

284
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:52,207
We were driving into town
and we almost ran into
this funeral procession

285
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,514
and this lady spilled out of
the coffin they were carrying.

286
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,167
We weren't going that fast.

287
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,648
And she had
her tongue cut out, so...

288
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:02,173
I'm gonna need
to see your I.D.Okay, yeah.

289
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:17,537
All right,
which of you two young ladies
is missing a tongue?

290
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,842
Her.

291
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,671
Yeah, I know, I know.

292
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,632
Her name is Esmerelda,
Sheriff.

293
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,373
Esmerelda.

294
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:35,642
Well, now, Esmerelda, I don't
know what happened to you,

295
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,861
but I want you to know that

296
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:41,691
we're gonna make sure you get
the very best of care, okay?

297
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,345
You two are lucky.

298
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,479
A lot of crazy shit goes down
here on November 1st.

299
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,916
I'll just take care
of our little girl here

300
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,267
and the two of you just drag
that coffin out of the road.

301
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,358
I got a bad wheel.
All right. That's it.

302
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,142
Hey, Sheriff?
It's, uh--

303
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:01,363
What about our car?
It's totaled. Can we rent one?

304
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,800
[laughs]

305
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,846
Rent a car?Yeah.

306
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,370
There's not even a mechanic
within a hundred miles of here.

307
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:09,850
Are you kidding?

308
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:12,200
I'll hold onto
your driver's license.

309
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,202
We'll see about getting you
out of here tomorrow.

310
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,336
There's a hotel across
the street. Just ask for Oleta.

311
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,774
Don't fight me now.

312
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,170
Santa Bonita.

313
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,087
We'll just wait here, then.It could be worse.

314
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:34,222
I guess this turned out
to be the scenic route
to my parents, then.

315
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,963
It's quaint,
I'll give you that.

316
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:43,927
Hello?

317
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,414
Uh, hello?

318
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:58,246
[rings bell]

319
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:06,254
Hola. Como esta usted?

320
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,389
Por favor necesito...

321
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,014
Easy, now.

322
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:30,800
Easy! Easy.

323
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,587
Very good, sugar.

324
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,416
Now, you'll be safe in here.

325
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,164
[sighs]

326
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,698
Oh, Lily.

327
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,051
What are you doing here?

328
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,706
Oh, just need a room.

329
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:09,491
We have no rooms.

330
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:12,451
You-You-You have no rooms?

331
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,759
Okay, right now, I'd settle
for a broom closet, honestly.

332
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:19,327
You've got some seriously weird
people running around.

333
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,896
I've had a really rough day.
If I was you, I'd lock
that door.

334
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,854
I'd bar the windows--Is there a problem?

335
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,901
You did bar the windows. Que pasa?

336
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:30,469
You need just one room?

337
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,383
Yeah, just the one room.

338
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,345
Room five.

339
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,478
Dinner will be served
promptly at 7.

340
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:43,525
If you're late,
you will go hungry.

341
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,961
Okay.

342
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,877
Thank you. I think.

343
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,662
[Old Woman hisses]

344
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,490
Just one moment, please.

345
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,541
Yeah, weird.

346
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,117
Oleta wishes you
to have this.

347
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,684
It is a holiday.

348
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,773
She wishes you to celebrate.

349
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,644
What holiday is it?

350
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:19,692
November 1st. Ours is a town
of old ways and customs.

351
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,911
Many of the people
have gone away.

352
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,566
A few have stayed,

353
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,525
but not many.

354
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:30,180
Joss, it's Día de los Muertos,
the Day of the Dead.

355
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,834
What?

356
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:34,271
It's the day our people
believe the dead return

357
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:37,144
to walk the earth to see
their loved ones once more.

358
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,146
It's an ancient
tradition in Mexico.

359
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:42,845
That may be true in other towns,
but not here, Alicia.

360
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:43,890
Oh, no.

361
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,501
That is why
you must--[bell rings]

362
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,460
If you'll excuse me.Yeah.

363
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,950
Okay. Nice.

364
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,648
So...
[clears throat]

365
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,652
1892.

366
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:10,656
I wonder if it's
a good year for wine.

367
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:13,920
We'll find out.We'll find out.

368
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,837
Nice.

369
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,143
Oh, man, can you
believe this place?

370
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,842
How creepy. I feel like
I'm in the Haunted Mansion.

371
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:26,280
[spooky voice]
"Of course, there's
always my way out!"

372
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:29,022
[sinister laugh]Okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop.

373
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:31,677
Yeah, this place is
definitely a little freaky.

374
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,419
A little? Yeah, well,
yeah, definitely.

375
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,552
Like, a lot freaky.

376
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,337
Lady downstairs was like,
"Sorry, there are no rooms
available."

377
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,602
And then says, "Well, no, there
actually are some rooms left."

378
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,691
This shit hole
has nothing but empty rooms.

379
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:48,345
Who cares? Let's just get
the hell outta here.

380
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:49,869
I'd love to get
the hell outta here.

381
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:52,088
Well, you heard
what the sheriff said, babe.

382
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,656
The car's not gonna be ready
for another day, so--

383
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,528
Forget the sheriff, Joss.
Maybe we can call my parents.

384
00:26:57,572 --> 00:27:00,444
They are gonna be so pissed
at me for being late.

385
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:03,839
Wait a minute. Your parents
are gonna be pissed?Yeah.

386
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:07,147
You know what?
I have a better idea.

387
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,714
Can you hold that?

388
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,676
Ah, two bars.Who are you calling?

389
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,069
Huh?Who are you calling?

390
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:19,463
Ah! What up, homeboy?
Ha! How's the O.C.?

391
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,683
Of course.Uh-huh.

392
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,685
Yeah, is it really,
really pretty
with all the pretty people?

393
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,731
It's a'ight.
Dude, check it out.

394
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:29,125
Me and Alicia were on our way
down to visit her parents

395
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:31,737
down here in Mexico,
and we ran into a...

396
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,695
into some car trouble.Car trouble?

397
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,610
If I tell him
what actually happened,

398
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,438
there's no way
of him coming down here.

399
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,483
Okay.So, let me lie.

400
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,311
We're partying.
Of course we are.

401
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:44,401
I don't know, bro. We're
drinking like really good wine.

402
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,229
We're chilling out.
It's pretty tight.

403
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,840
You wanna come down?

404
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:51,104
This place you've probably never
heard of called Santa Bonita.

405
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:52,671
Yeah.

406
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:56,413
No, no one speaks Spanish.
It's all English.

407
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:58,589
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

408
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,767
So, what's up, dude?
You gonna come down?

409
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,554
Tyler? Tyler?

410
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:09,731
"Day of the Dead Cell Phones"
is more like it.

411
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:12,255
And my charger's in the car,
which sucks.

412
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,736
Hmm.So. Um...

413
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,652
[giggling]

414
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,089
Are you gonna
take a shower?

415
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,917
Why? Do I need one?

416
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,790
I-I'm just asking.

417
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,661
[giggles]

418
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,578
This wine is really strong.
I'm seeing three of you now.

419
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,754
Oh, really? Lucky you.

420
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,321
Yeah.

421
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,759
See you when you get back.

422
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,500
Mm-hmm.

423
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,641
[water running]

424
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,617
[gasps]

425
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,105
[bathroom door opens]

426
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:24,806
Joss, I just saw something
in the bathroom--

427
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,808
a reflection
of a little boy.

428
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,418
It was really
fucking creepy.

429
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,552
I mean, he was there
and then he was gone.

430
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,336
Of course
you saw shit, babe.

431
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,339
You had like half a bottle
of wine from 1892.

432
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,341
That shit
doesn't mess around.

433
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,653
I really, really
wanna get outta here.

434
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:49,135
I mean, this place is fucked up
and these people are crazy.

435
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,137
I know, babe, I know.
Don't worry though.

436
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,922
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you, okay?

437
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:57,230
The sheriff has taken Esmerelda
to get medical attention,

438
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,363
and we're in this
really creepy hotel,

439
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,366
waiting for Tyler and Erica
to come pick us up.

440
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,806
So, we just have to figure out
some weird way to kill time.Something.

441
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,461
Do you know of any
good way to kill time?I don't know.

442
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,247
I'll tell you one thing.What's that?

443
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,425
I am going to be
so happy to see Tyler for once.

444
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,519
Why do you have it in
for him so bad, anyway?

445
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:29,001
I just don't like the fact
that he sleeps around on Erica.

446
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:32,831
Well, it probably doesn't help
that she's a vacuous bimbo,

447
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,180
but still...

448
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,878
I think it doesn't help
that she's a cheerleader.

449
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,924
And you hate cheerleaders.[giggles]

450
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,969
You really, really do.
Don't you?

451
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,885
Just a little bit.
Yeah, okay, maybe a lot.

452
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,887
[laughs]

453
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,674
What's vacuous mean?

454
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:53,852
Empty-headed and shallow.

455
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:57,594
Who's empty-headed
and shallow?

456
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:00,597
[giggles]
Erica.

457
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,647
Hey.

458
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:51,997
What?

459
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,217
What time is it?

460
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,045
Do you remember me
telling you

461
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,221
about a little boy
in the bathroom?

462
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,136
Yeah. Of course.

463
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,966
I-I, uh-- I listen.

464
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,142
I just dreamed about him.

465
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,321
Um, is this your way
of telling me you want kids?

466
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:17,065
I think it's a little
early in the relationship,
but you know, if...

467
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,719
[groans]
Look, babe,

468
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,591
we both had a lot to drink
on an empty stomach,

469
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,507
which, in retrospect maybe
wasn't such a great idea,

470
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,554
but it's dinner time,
and it'd be a good idea

471
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:30,165
for us to get
some food in our stomachs.

472
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:32,646
[groans]

473
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:36,041
[indistinct voices]

474
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,694
Did you hear that?

475
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:40,001
At least we're not
the only ones here.

476
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,742
[Thomas]
They can't have disappeared.

477
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:44,266
They're probably
playing a prank, right?

478
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,007
How hard can it be

479
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:49,532
to find a teenage girl
and a little boy in this town?

480
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:52,187
[Woman yelling
indistinctly]

481
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,150
Yeah, I told you there was
a little boy in the bathroom.

482
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:00,848
And I bet Esmerelda
is their daughter, Joss.

483
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:03,851
She's no runaway.
She was probably kidnapped.

484
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,071
I better go
and talk to them.

485
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,116
[sighs]

486
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,120
[Thomas]
Doesn't anyone knock here?

487
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,602
[Woman]
Ricky! We've been worried
sick about you.

488
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,038
And where's Lily?

489
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,432
[Thomas]
Where is she?[loud banging]

490
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,087
Hey! Get away from my son!
Get away from him!

491
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,046
[Woman]
What are you doing?
Ricky, what are you doing?

492
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,180
[screams][stabbing sounds]

493
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,833
[Thomas]Ricky!

494
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:31,270
[Woman screams]

495
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:34,012
[screaming continues]

496
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,519
Are you all right?

497
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:09,525
I want to leave, okay?
I want to leave now.

498
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:10,874
Something terrible
happened here.

499
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,572
Yeah, babe, I know.

500
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:16,010
Well, I want to leave too,
but we can't.

501
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,317
Don't worry.

502
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,536
Tyler and Erica
are on their way down.

503
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,973
They're gonna be here
any minute, all right?

504
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,280
Tell you what, babe, hey.

505
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:28,283
How about if I go get
our bags out of our room

506
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:32,244
and we'll just go downstairs
and get something to eat
and wait for 'em.

507
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,897
Yeah, okay.Okay?

508
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,813
Maybe I should have something
to eat. Calm my nerves.

509
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:40,034
Okay. Yeah.
That's a good idea.

510
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,004
It's a nasty habit.

511
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:59,053
I'm sure it's killing me.

512
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,317
But I just love
the way it tastes.

513
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:10,151
It's kinda
like eatin' pussy.

514
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,546
You know, some guys...

515
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,158
Some guys get off on the way it
makes a woman feel, you know,

516
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:21,380
it gets her all moanin'
and wiggling around.

517
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,730
But I love the taste of it.

518
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:27,864
I love the taste
when I get my tongue in there.

519
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:35,568
You're probably wonderin'
why I'm telling you all this.

520
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:41,226
See, I been

521
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:44,272
dying a little death

522
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:48,102
a long, long time.

523
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,931
You, on the other hand...

524
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,592
you're prettier
than most of 'em.

525
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:03,248
But you're Mexican.

526
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:14,128
And we've got to have a Mexican
to keep those bastards
in their places.

527
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,086
Comprende, mi amor?

528
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:20,830
You Catholic?

529
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:30,536
Well, you better start saying
your pre-death shit,

530
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,582
'cause we're about to finish
what we started.

531
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:40,198
[screams]

532
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,243
What? What's that?

533
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,853
Cat got your tongue?

534
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:46,073
[sobbing]

535
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:48,728
Nope.

536
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,382
I got it.

537
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:07,268
That is not for you.

538
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,270
Sit over there.

539
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,186
All right.

540
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,232
You're the boss.

541
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,241
Uh, could we get some menus?

542
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,679
I have what I have.

543
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:30,813
If you don't want it,
you don't need to eat it.

544
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,730
[hisses]

545
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:50,268
You know what I love
about this place?

546
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,095
How warm
and sociable everyone is.

547
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,315
When we get home,
I'm gonna write to AAA

548
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,926
and have this place
declared a four diamond resort.

549
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,319
Not three, four.Stop it.

550
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,060
What?They're gonna hear you.

551
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:03,368
I don't care.
It's not like we're ever
coming back here again ever.

552
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,674
'Cause this place is, you know,
not-coming-back-to-able.

553
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,894
Would you care for
some more wine?

554
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,852
[Both]
No.

555
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,115
Mescal?

556
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,639
No.What's that?

557
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,728
Tequila.No.

558
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,515
I guess she doesn't
understand that in English--

559
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,952
[Boy]
Help me! Help me!

560
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,184
There's nothing here.

561
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,541
You ready for weird?

562
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,631
No, I think I've had
enough weird for one day.

563
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,286
They're all over the place.

564
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,419
Must leave 'em around
like Bibles.

565
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,597
That is for you.

566
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,208
It speaks
for those who cannot.

567
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,253
[bell ringing]

568
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:15,918
[grunts]

569
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,993
Whatever creeps you got,

570
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:49,561
I think it's contagious.

571
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:53,347
Got a little time left
so I can get her ready.

572
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,001
Oh, shoot.

573
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,578
We got a little problem.

574
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:11,321
Looks like we're gonna need
another Mexican.

575
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:17,327
The last three pages
have been ripped out.

576
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:20,069
Maybe they're back
where I found it.

577
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,494
What the fuck is this shit?

578
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:58,412
This isn't like any Día de los 
Muertosaltar I've ever seen.

579
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,500
Really?

580
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,546
[distant moaning]

581
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,948
Hello?

582
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,520
Nothing.

583
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:26,179
[grunting]

584
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,535
Okay, shh!

585
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:52,684
[yelling]

586
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,076
Fuck!

587
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,469
[laughs]Oh, goddamn it!

588
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,166
Got you, baby.
Happy Halloween!

589
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,864
You guys are fuckin' assholes.
Seriously.

590
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:01,606
A little shaky today,
are we, Joss?Yeah, that's not funny.

591
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:04,130
You two look like
you just saw a ghost.

592
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:05,610
A few too many, in fact.

593
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:08,264
Are you ready to go?Let's get out of here.

594
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:09,614
Wait, go?
We just got here.

595
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:10,919
Yeah, we're exhausted.

596
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:12,747
We've been driving
the last couple hours.

597
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:15,750
We should spend the night here
and go in the morning.

598
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:18,057
[Erica]
This is a lovely town
you found here.

599
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,581
'Cause I mean, really,
who needs running water?

600
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,018
Yo, man,
we saw your car outside.

601
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:25,194
Looking a little extra toe-up
than usual.

602
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:26,195
Yeah.

603
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,588
You know what?

604
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,938
You guys really did
get here fast. Thank you.

605
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:33,594
That's because daddy
bought my baby a fast,
expensive little car.

606
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:36,554
Wish I had
a daddy like that.I don't think you understand.

607
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,469
There is something about this
town we really don't like.

608
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:42,037
Joss didn't tell you what
happened this morning.

609
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:45,084
No, Joss didn't tell us
what happened this morning.
What happened, Joss?

610
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:46,564
Some fuckin'
freaky-deaky shit, man.

611
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,783
No, really, it was...
You don't feel like driving?

612
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:52,178
I'm happy to drive if it means
getting out of Dodge tonight.

613
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,701
There was a funeral
in the street.

614
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:55,834
This woman-- her tongue
had been sliced out.

615
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:58,097
Oh, her tongue
had been sliced out.

616
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,621
Yes!Okay, yeah, that is
pretty freaky-deaky.

617
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:02,580
I'll say.
Freaky-deaky.

618
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:07,410
But listen, we're fried.
We got wine, we got food.
Nobody to bother us.

619
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,849
Truth be told, man, we're just
glad to get out of the dorm.

620
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:14,113
The whole place smells
like booze and spooge.Nasty.

621
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:17,246
And this place--
it's not that bad.
What do you think, babe?

622
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,597
I think
it's kind of romantic.

623
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,251
Romantic, if your idea of
romantic is the Overlook Hotel.

624
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:25,254
The what? It's just a little Shining
reference, babe.

625
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:26,778
You know, "Overlook Hotel,"

626
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,127
Jack Torrance,

627
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,824
"Here's Johnny."

628
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:33,001
What?Really? Wow.

629
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:36,004
Her idea of an old movie
is pre- American Pie.

630
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,616
No shit.[Erika]
Shut up!

631
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,748
Yeah, um, listen, guys.

632
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,881
Um, I'm gonna get our bags.

633
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:44,926
I'm gonna go
put 'em in the car

634
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,667
and we can
talk about this later.

635
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,235
I'm sure there's some other
hotel in some other town.

636
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:50,671
This one's not gonna cut it.

637
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:53,326
Don't mess up my car.

638
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,588
Don't...Don't go out there.

639
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,850
Babe, it's gonna be okay.

640
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:58,113
I gotta tell the sheriff
we're splitting anyway.

641
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:00,333
We'll be back tomorrow
to get the car.

642
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:04,250
That's all I get?We got some more where
that came from. L'chaim.

643
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,904
Yeah.

644
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:34,062
[growling]

645
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:44,899
You are a catch.I know.

646
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:47,772
What the hell
do you see in him?I know! It's crazy!

647
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:49,643
It's crazy!It's crazy, right?

648
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,341
It's crazy!Crazy! You are hot.

649
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:57,782
You're hot, smart,
and creative I think...Mm-hmm.

650
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,827
You speak, what,
five languages?Five languages.

651
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:00,828
Five languages.Five.

652
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,743
And what,
I barely speak one.

653
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:07,530
English, Spanish, French...

654
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,141
English, Spanish...

655
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,012
[laughs]
Okay, babe.Shut up!

656
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:12,797
You're drunk.I am not.

657
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,320
Are too.Am not.

658
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:15,408
[glass smashes]

659
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:16,757
Oh!Am too.

660
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:35,733
[Tyler]
What's this?

661
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:38,039
Ojaldra.

662
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:41,956
Sweet bread made by Oleta,
for the festival of the dead.

663
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,308
I hope you enjoy it

664
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,660
Muchas gracias.

665
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:55,404
English, Spanish, French,
Mexican, Italian...is that five?

666
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:57,885
Let's see what we got
going on here.

667
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,844
English, Spanish...

668
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:01,802
Mmm, this is some
good shit, right here.

669
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,804
Yo, taste this.
This right here,

670
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:06,067
with a little chocolate syrup,
a little whipped cream...

671
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:10,593
[Erika]
I was thinking,
more like hash but, you know.

672
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:15,773
Hash ojaldra.

673
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,818
You might have something there.

674
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,602
Hash ojaldra.

675
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,954
How much carbs
do you think is in this?Oh, you look great.

676
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:25,826
It doesn't matter how many
carbs, eat it. Go ahead.

677
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,829
No. Not until I see a label.

678
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,831
Babe, it's homemade.

679
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,877
They don't make
labels here, okay?

680
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,837
Plus, it's rude if you don't
eat it when they offer you
something. Right, Alicia?

681
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:42,625
Well, I guess, when in Rome...
just be in Rome.

682
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,802
Mm-hmm. Some good shit
right here.

683
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,848
You should
really have some.Okay.

684
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:51,852
I'm just not gonna have any of
that zillion-proof wine with it.

685
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,596
Careful of the bones.

686
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,514
Fuck!

687
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:15,833
Shit!

688
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:19,358
We are out of here now!

689
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:22,883
Hey! Hey, guys.
Tyler! Tyl--

690
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,842
Fuck! Erica!

691
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:27,888
What the fuck? Shit.

692
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,237
[fires gun]

693
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:31,805
Hey! Where the fuck's Alicia?What?

694
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,589
Alicia!
Where the fuck is she?

695
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,896
Uh, I don't know,
I don't know.Shit.

696
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,899
That fucking bitch put something
in our food, you guys.

697
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,858
What the fuck?

698
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:46,602
Take this, and if
she comes back, make sure
she never leaves your sight.

699
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:49,388
Don't trust any of those
townspeople. They're in
on whatever's going on.

700
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,172
You're buggin' out--Do what I say!

701
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:54,915
If she gets back, get in
the car and honk the horn.
I'll come running.

702
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,352
All right, I need the keys.

703
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:01,226
Wait. Where are you going
to look for her?

704
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:02,880
There.

705
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,841
Whoo!

706
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,149
[crowd yelling, chanting]

707
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,179
Oh.

708
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:43,572
Excuse me,
have you seen Alicia?

709
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:44,922
[growls]Oh, my God.

710
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:47,620
The girl who was
here before. Alicia.

711
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:50,362
Adonde esta Alicia?

712
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:53,974
Muerta.

713
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,889
Muerta.

714
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,979
[crowd yelling, chanting]

715
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,074
Alicia!

716
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:10,991
Alicia! Alicia!
Wake up, baby!

717
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,126
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back!

718
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:17,345
Back up!

719
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:20,566
Drop the knife,
motherfucker.

720
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:22,307
Drop the knife!

721
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,834
You drop that
fucking knife.

722
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:29,227
Now!

723
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,322
Oh...

724
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:39,019
Thank God.

725
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:42,675
Thank God you still
have your tongue.

726
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,157
[grunts]

727
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:49,464
Now look what you've done.

728
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,858
They're gonna come
for you now.

729
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:54,208
Just like they did Lily.

730
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:59,735
[Sheriff]
You should have
let me finish.

731
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:01,172
Without a sacrifice,

732
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:04,523
those bastards will
come back out of the ground.

733
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:08,875
Oh, you have no idea
what you've done.

734
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,703
She hasn't been satisfied.

735
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:13,445
What the hell
are you talking about?

736
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:18,928
[Sheriff]
Now you're all gonna die.

737
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:21,540
I could have stopped them,
but it's too late.

738
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,673
It's too late!

739
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:29,548
[Sheriff]
I tried to do what
you told me to do, Oleta.

740
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,158
I tried!

741
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:34,379
I tried!

742
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:38,035
Not yet!
[grunts]

743
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,087
Mother.

744
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:49,002
[growling, moaning]

745
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,135
[screams]

746
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:58,055
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

747
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,579
Fuck. The keys.
Tyler has 'em.

748
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:02,146
Tyler!

749
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:05,018
Tyler! Let's go.
We're leaving.What's going on?

750
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,195
Are you okay, babe?
We're leaving! Give me the keys!Here.

751
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:09,979
Let's go!

752
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:11,720
Come on!

753
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,116
Shit, they've got
the car surrounded now.

754
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,640
[Alicia]
I don't think those are
the people from the church.

755
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,816
Look at them.[Joss]
Who the hell are they?

756
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,340
[Erika]
They'd better not
damage my car,

757
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:25,082
Shut up, Erica!All right, guys,
let's get back inside.

758
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,346
Before they see us. Come on.
Erica, Tyler. Let's go guys!

759
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,565
[all moaning]

760
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,355
I'm gonna go check
this door and upstairs.All right.

761
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:39,400
I'm okay.You're okay?

762
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:41,489
Wipe this shit off of me.

763
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:44,144
[Tyler]
Joss, I'm gonna
go upstairs and secure it.

764
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,755
Okay.Give me the keys.

765
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:48,279
[Joss]
Are you okay, babe?

766
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,715
I'm okay.You all right?

767
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:51,586
Yes.Hey. Hey, hey.

768
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,197
Thank you.

769
00:51:57,157 --> 00:52:00,900
Okay, babe.
I don't have enough bullets to
deal with all those people.

770
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:04,121
I'm gonna run
to the sheriff's office
and grab some more bullets.

771
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:06,079
Okay? Babe?

772
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,733
I'll be right back.

773
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,169
I'll be right back.

774
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,216
Joss! Wait.[opens door]

775
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,522
Give me the gun.
I can cover you.

776
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:17,003
I'm fine.
Give me the gun.

777
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,659
Okay.

778
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:27,361
You ready?

779
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:30,364
Go. Get back!

780
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:44,291
What the fuck?

781
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,517
Hello?

782
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,171
Hey!

783
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:57,435
Exc-- Hey! Hello?

784
00:52:57,478 --> 00:53:00,002
Esmerelda?
Esmerelda, is that you?

785
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:03,223
Hello?
Are you-- Are you okay?

786

[screeching]

792
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:13,902
I don't like this.

793
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:18,255
What's taking Joss so long?

794
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:26,263
Stay back!

795
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,310
I'm warning you!

796
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,345
Shit![groans]

797
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,607
Fuck!

798
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:09,001
I'm gonna go get Joss.

799
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,264
Are you crazy? No.

800
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,310
I'll be fine.
I'll be right back.

801
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:15,268
I promise.

802
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,923
I'll be right back.

803
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,884
Joss!

804
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:24,886
Hey, look,
y'all need to stay back!

805
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,020
Look, I don't want no problems
and neither do you.

806
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,761
[moaning]

807
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:35,244
[yelling indistinctly]

808
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:36,507
Back the fuck up!

809
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,727
Oh, shit!

810
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:42,513
Tyler, get inside! Now!

811
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:44,950
Come here, dog!
[yells]

812
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,172
Tell me I didn't see
what I think I saw.

813
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:51,522
Help me move this![Joss groans]

814
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:56,091
[all moaning]

815
00:55:56,135 --> 00:56:00,313
What's going on, here?
What is going on?

816
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,011
Shit! I need something to
sterilize this wound right now.

817
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,883
Hurry up, please!
Did it bite you?

818
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:07,320
Yes! What the fuck
does it look like?

819
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,844
Bit me like
I was a fucking Big Mac.

820
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:11,411
[groans]
It fucking hurts!

821
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,545
Calm down, relax.
It'll be okay.

822
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:16,416
This shit is deep.

823
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,245
You knew!

824
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:21,465
You knew and you
didn't say anything.

825
00:56:21,508 --> 00:56:23,423
Those plates on the windows,

826
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,686
they're to keep
them out, aren't they?

827
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,385
[grunts]
Aren't they?

828
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,212
Okay, we've got nothing.

829
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:32,476
What's out there?I have no idea.

830
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,001
They looked like dead people and
those things wouldn't go down.
Lower this leg.

831
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:39,483
I shot one of those
bitches three times
and she wouldn't go down!

832
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:41,876
Calm him down.
Alicia, help me move this couch.

833
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,878
We've gotta block
the other door.Joss...

834
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:47,447
You don't think the bite--If this was a movie,
maybe yes,

835
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,493
but in real life,
I have no idea.

836
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,408
I don't have no heart
to kill him,

837
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,279
and if he starts turning,
you don't either.

838
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:56,543
Let's just stop talking
about it and block
the other door, please.

839
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:00,417
Hey, guys...

840
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,942
We should go upstairs.You're right.

841
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,596
I think we'll be
safer upstairs.

842
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:08,207
Come on, let me help you
upstairs, dog.

843
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,904
Wait, what are you doing?

844
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:13,255
What are you
talking about, babe?You can't take him upstairs.

845
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:15,388
What if he turns
into one of those things?

846
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,521
Erica, are you serious?

847
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:19,610
Yes, I'm serious.
You just said it yourself.

848
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,481
He's been bit.
He could be infected.

849
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,570
Do you wanna
take the chance?

850
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:26,486
[grunts]Do you?

851
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,534
She's right. She's right.
We can't take that chance.

852
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:32,100
We can't take that chance.

853
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:34,842
Yes, we can.
We are not gonna do this.

854
00:57:34,886 --> 00:57:37,497
[Joss]
No, no, no, no.

855
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,413
She's right.
She's right. Really.

856
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,372
I can't risk turning
into one of those things.

857
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,636
I can't risk hurting
one of you guys.

858
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:48,203
So, just leave me
here with the shotgun.

859
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:51,511
Leave me here with the shotgun
and I'll hold down
the fort, okay?

860
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,731
So, just leave me here,
you guys.

861
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:55,515
[Alicia]
You can't do this!

862
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,300
Baby, baby...

863
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:02,522
It's the only way unless you're
prepared to kill me yourself.

864
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,483
Go on.

865
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:09,050
Coming?

866
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:15,666
I'm staying here with him.

867
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:19,234
Alicia, stand by your man--

868
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:20,758
normally, very noble.

869
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:23,587
I get it, okay? But right now,
you're asking for death.

870
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,546
And Tyler and I need you with us
if we're gonna survive.

871
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:30,985
I was with you,
until you decided to abandon
my boyfriend to those things.

872
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:34,641
What do you think?
Daddy's gonna come
down here to rescue you?

873
00:58:34,685 --> 00:58:36,382
We are in this together.

874
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:39,559
And the minute we all start
to turn on each other,
we are finished.

875
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,909
You're just a coward
when it comes down to it.

876
00:58:41,953 --> 00:58:45,043
Daddy's scared little girl!Okay, you know what?

877
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:47,001
Coward? Really?
Fuck you! Okay?

878
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,482
Tyler and I are here
because of you.

879
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,528
And this is
the thanks we get?

880
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,573
You didn't tell us
what was going on.

881
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,444
You didn't
say a goddamn word.

882
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,838
We are here because you
and Joss were selfish!

883
00:58:57,882 --> 00:58:59,536
[screams]

884
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:04,062
Joss, we gotta go, we gotta go.
Come on, dog.

885
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:05,454
[Erika]
Come on!

886
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:07,631
We don't have time for that.
Here, take this.

887
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:09,589
Ah, there you go.[Joss screams]

888
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:11,635
[moaning, shrieking]

889
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,597
Don't move.

890
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:24,604
They're not by the car anymore.
We could run for it.

891
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,781
Joss can't run on this leg.
It needs to be treated.

892
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:30,131
Well, we've got
to do something.

893
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,568
Hold on, buddy.

894
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:32,786
Fuck.

895
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,180
Let me sterilize
the wound with alcohol.

896
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,835
Martia said there
was mescal downstairs.
I'm gonna go find her.

897
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:39,619
Alicia, be careful.

898
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,622
[Joss]
Look at me. Look at me.

899
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,103
[growling]

900
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,722
I thought you said
there was mescal here.

901
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,942
Look carefully.

902
00:59:57,985 --> 01:00:00,640
You will find
what you need here.

903
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:04,122
All I see are a bunch
of creepy art projects.

904
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:07,429
The past determines
the future.

905
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,868
Cut out the fortune-cookie
wisdom, okay?

906
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:14,045
It's getting a little old.
Maybe it's in the kitchen.

907
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:19,354
You wanna get me
some more hot water, babe?Sure.

908
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:25,273
Hey, man, I'm all right.
I'm getting a little--
[moans]

909
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:28,537
I'm getting worried
about Alicia.Relax, relax, big guy.

910
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,583
Who's the doctor here?

911
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,195
Doctor? You've been in premed,
what, three months?

912
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,850
You sure you know
what you're doing?Hey, you lucked out.

913
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:40,637
I almost went pre-law.
Hold this for me.

914
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,683
All right.Squeeze.
This is gonna hurt.

915
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,554
All right, one more.

916
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,948
[water sloshing]

917
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:01,848
I saw blood.

918
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:08,028
Blood stains everything
in this house

919
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,857
and this town.

920
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:14,774
We should talk to them,
let them know about the danger.

921
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:17,821
We must do more than that,
Alicia. You must...

922
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:20,084
[bell rings][gasps]

923
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:21,825
I must go.Wait!

924
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:24,871
Come on, Alicia,
I need the alcohol.

925
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:48,765
Goddamn.

926
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:54,161
Hang on. You know
what I mean?

927
01:02:54,205 --> 01:02:55,946
[turns faucet off]

928
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:57,861
You okay?

929
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,821
You all right, babe?

930
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,694
What's wrong?

931
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:08,262
[sniffling]

932
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:10,525
I'm so scared.

933
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:15,008
Come here, baby.
It's okay.

934
01:03:15,052 --> 01:03:17,837
[crying]It's gonna be okay.

935
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,665
Trust me.

936
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:22,450
Just be strong, please.
Just keep going.

937
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,768
I love you.

938
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:50,827
[moaning loudly]

939
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:55,135
[Joss groans]

940
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,790
You're all good, bro.

941
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:02,969
See anything out there?

942
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:06,146
[electricity surges]What the fuck?

943
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,803
[Joss]
Are you kidding me?
Are they in?

944
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,587
They're not inside. They
probably just cut the power.

945
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:14,851
Look, I'm gonna
get some matches, okay?

946
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:18,028
How did they get at the wiring?
What the fuck do those things
want out there?

947
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:20,857
[Tyler ]
Whatever it is, they either
want us or something in here,

948
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,816
because I don't see 'em
banging on anybody else's door.

949
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,905
Maybe they just like
white girls.Fuck off.

950
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:27,907
You never stop, do you?[chuckles]
No.

951
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,604
I can't believe you two
are laughing.

952
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:31,911
I had a chunk taken out
of my leg and I'm still
enjoying myself.

953
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,957
We gotta do something,
you guys.

954
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,829
I agree, but we're
surrounded in here.
Not much we can do but wait.

955
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:40,789
Well, sitting around
waiting to die isn't so much
a plan, it's suicide.

956
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,054
I've got something else
in mind, so get the shotgun.

957
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:45,969
Come on.

958
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:50,887
Here you go. Be right
back now, all right?

959
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:54,891
Hey, Tyler, thanks.

960
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,675
No doubt, man.

961
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:02,159
Alicia, check that door,
make sure it's secure.

962
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,335
I'm gonna make a run
for the car.

963
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:08,121
I'm gonna pull it right up
to the front door. Through it
if I fucking have to.

964
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:12,125
Are you crazy? If anybody's
going out there,
it's gonna be me.

965
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:13,953
Why? 'Cause you're
a big, tough guy?

966
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,869
No, tough girl. 'Cause
I don't want you out there
risking your life.

967
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,828
When, what? When you
could be risking yours?

968
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:21,918
It's a very good answer,
but it's not gonna fly,
all right?

969
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:24,790
Besides, you're the only one
who knows anything
about being a doctor.

970
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:28,968
So, just keep the testosterone
in check, okay?

971
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,449
[zombies moaning]

972
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,887
I'll go, Erica.
I got you into this.

973
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,977
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for Joss and me.

974
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,980
Don't remind me,
but you don't know how
to drive stick

975
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:45,028
and now's not really
the best time to learn.

976
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:46,638
I'd rather be out there
than in here.

977
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:49,771
So, I'm going.
That's that.

978
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,124
Plus, I got the keys, so--

979
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:58,650
I hope you're as good
a shot as Joss says, because
once I get out there,

980
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,131
I'm gonna need you
to hold those guys back
or I'm not gonna make it.

981
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:03,481
Holding down your back,
baby. Don't worry
about that.

982
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,009
Tell Joss that I'm sorry.You can tell him yourself
in the car.

983
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,969
Okay. Are you still
mad at me?

984
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:14,622
[chuckles]

985
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:16,798
Take this.
You're gonna need it.

986
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,975
Let's go!

987
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:25,068
All right, look,
on the count of three,
open each door.

988
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:28,027
We're just gonna
go out blastin'. Erica.

989
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:36,122
What was that for?

990
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,950
Luck.

991
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:42,085
Could have put
a little tongue into it.

992
01:06:43,129 --> 01:06:45,827
Three, two, one!

993
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:50,006
Ah, hell no!
Go, baby, go, go!

994
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,659
[shouting]

995
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:53,618
Yes, she made it!She made it?

996
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:55,968
[growling loudly]

997
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,236
Good to meet you.[grunting]

998
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,195
[screams]

999
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,547
Guys, I need some backup!

1000
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:16,945
I'm clearing the way for you,
baby! Don't stop running!
Go! Go! Go, baby!

1001
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,133
[zombies scream]

1002
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:35,529
Come on,
let's go back inside.

1003
01:07:44,712 --> 01:07:47,280
[zombies growling]

1004
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,680
[zombie groans]

1005
01:07:57,682 --> 01:08:01,120
She's coming around.
Here. I'm gonna go get Joss.

1006
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:04,993
Wait, what about Martia
and the old woman? We've gotta
take them with us, too.

1007
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:08,171
That's too many people.
We can't fit all of them.
It's just us. That's it.

1008
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:10,521
Okay, you know what?
You go, get help.

1009
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:14,133
I will stay here with Joss and
protect those people until you
can bring back the Federales

1010
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:18,137
or whoever can take care of
whatever those things are, okay?

1011
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:20,400
You sure?Yes, I'm sure.

1012
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:23,142
All right. Let me move
this out of the way.

1013
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:25,144
I'm gonna go help Erica.

1014
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:27,146
[horn honking]

1015
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:31,759
On three, now. Lock the door
behind me, all right?Okay.

1016
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:35,154
One, two, three!

1017
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,504
[zombies roaring]

1018
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:40,203
Oh, my God.

1019
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:56,088
I love you.

1020
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,831
[screaming]

1021
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,400
Put me down!

1022
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:15,673
[bones cracking]

1023
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:18,241
[crying]

1024
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:25,987
[crying]What's she doing now?

1025
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,033
[sobs]

1026
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:34,300
Nothing. She's just sitting
at the end of the street.

1027
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:37,390
What's she waiting for?I don't know, Joss!

1028
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:40,088
All right, babe.
It's just a question.

1029
01:09:40,132 --> 01:09:43,788
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just...

1030
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:47,661
You just didn't see
what happened. I watched Tyler
die right in front of me.

1031
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:57,454
It's okay. It's okay.

1032
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:01,806
If we can just make it
through the night,
maybe they'll go away, right?

1033
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:04,243
'Cause tomorrow
the Day of the Dead's
gonna be over with.

1034
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,247
And they'll just...
go away, right?

1035
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:11,207
Right?

1036
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:17,952
I'll be back.

1037
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,046
[growling]

1038
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:32,837
Tyler, come here. Tyler.

1039
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,752
[flesh tearing][screams]

1040
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:42,934
[screams]
Tyler, don't!

1041
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:45,371
No, please, please!

1042
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:47,330
Please, please, please!

1043
01:10:48,766 --> 01:10:51,769
Martia, I need to know
what the hell is going on

1044
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,511
in this godforsaken town
of yours.

1045
01:10:54,554 --> 01:10:56,252
You are right.

1046
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:59,777
God has forsaken this town.

1047
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,475
All that is holy
has no place here,

1048
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,348
and your boyfriend
was partly right

1049
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:08,786
when he guessed I knew
what was going to happen.

1050
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:13,094
I also prayed
and hoped for it.

1051
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:16,707
Sit down.

1052
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:20,711
What is all this?

1053
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,718
I don't understand.
How can all this be happening?

1054
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:30,155
How can she know the future?

1055
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:35,073
Over 150 years ago,

1056
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:38,337
this town was first settled
by the Diaz family.

1057
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:41,035
They owned the land

1058
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:44,865
and employed
most of the laborers
who worked here.

1059
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:48,565
One day,

1060
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:52,612
Vargas Diaz's workers
made the most incredible find.

1061
01:11:58,444 --> 01:12:02,013
They had found 
an ancient Aztec temple--

1062
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:06,844
the shrine to the lady 
of the dead herself, 
Mictecacihuatl.

1063
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:11,283
The temple was filled with gold 
and jewels of such a value

1064
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,503
no man could put 
a price on it.

1065
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:17,463
Vargas believed the Goddess, 
in return for his sacrifice,

1066
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:20,423
would reward him 
with his greatest wish--

1067
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:22,381
immortality.

1068
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:26,124
Diaz put everyone
in town to work

1069
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:29,519
while offering to split
his unimaginable wealth

1070
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:32,652
with all those who helped him 
work the mines.

1071
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:35,655
But first, he would have to 
deal with the town sheriff,

1072
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:38,919
his oldest friend, Martinez.

1073
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:42,401
What is this?A going-away present.

1074
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:44,360
Going away?

1075
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:48,233
I don't think so.

1076
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:02,943
You've already
taken my wife.

1077
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:08,427
I won't let you take
my daughter as well,
Señor Diaz.

1078
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,043
Choose, Martinez.

1079
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,568
Do you want to leave
here breathing,

1080
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:21,527
or in a pine box?

1081
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:25,270
You must promise me, Vargas,

1082
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:30,275
that you will never
set a hand on her.

1083
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:34,192
Martinez,
you need not worry.

1084
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:40,503
I would never harm
my Oleta's little girl.

1085
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:46,378
So, I say ride, Sheriff,
before I change my mind.

1086
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:06,616
I'm sorry you won't be here
to celebrate Day of the Dead
here with us.

1087
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:10,968
We will miss you, Martinez.

1088
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:21,326
[Martia] Sparing his wife's 
first husband, Martinez, 
by sending him away,

1089
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:23,633
he invited everyone to town

1090
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:26,549
to a celebration 
of Día de los Muertos

1091
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:29,682
for the final excavation 
of the temple.

1092
01:14:29,726 --> 01:14:32,076
But he betrayed them all,

1093
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:34,948
[horse neighs]

1094
01:14:34,992 --> 01:14:37,211
[people screaming]

1095
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:40,519
detonating it and 
imprisoning everyone within,

1096
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:42,782
looting its treasure 
for himself

1097
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:46,786
and sealing a bargain 
with the Goddess of Death. [sobbing]

1098
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,702
So everyone in the town 
was buried alive,

1099
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:53,271
but not Vargas.

1100
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:58,102
No, he had other things
to attend to that night.

1101
01:14:58,145 --> 01:15:02,628
I'll tell ya,
when I get back to Texas,
I'm gonna sell this junk,

1102
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:05,544
and buy myself
the biggest,

1103
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:09,679
fattest, Texas whore
you ever did see.[all chuckling]

1104
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:12,551
When I get back, I'm gonna
go down to the stable,
get her some--

1105
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:14,988
Papi! Papi! Papi!

1106
01:15:17,817 --> 01:15:20,820
Luis, what have you
done to your face?

1107
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:23,170
Can I go
to the celebration, too?

1108
01:15:23,214 --> 01:15:28,132
No, Luis. You must
practice your violin.
It is very important.

1109
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:31,614
You must be the best
at everything you do,

1110
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:33,616
and your playing
is improving all the time.

1111
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:37,881
In time, you will thank me
for all the sacrifices

1112
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:40,274
I have made for our family.

1113
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:43,451
But I wanna go. Everyone else
in town will be there.

1114
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:46,063
No, Luis.

1115
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:50,502
Do as I say,
or I'll take you to my knee.

1116
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:55,289
Now, there will be much time
to celebrate later.

1117
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:05,691
As I was saying, none of this
would be damn near possible
without you, Mr. Vargas.

1118
01:16:05,735 --> 01:16:07,911
All we been doing
was working the brothels

1119
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:10,478
and bouncing barflies
back north.

1120
01:16:10,522 --> 01:16:12,611
You invited us
into your home,

1121
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:15,309
made us part
of your family.

1122
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:19,705
We won't forget what
you've done for us.
No, sir, we won't ever forget.

1123
01:16:19,749 --> 01:16:23,448
A toast to Mr. Vargas.

1124
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:25,406
[Men]
Here, here.

1125
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:28,540
And to Mictecacihuatl,

1126
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,195
lady of the dead,

1127
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:34,981
who has brought us all together
and given us so much.

1128
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:36,896
[Men]
Here, here.

1129
01:16:38,855 --> 01:16:41,379
Given me so much.

1130
01:16:41,422 --> 01:16:44,817
So very, very much.

1131
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:49,256
[Men gagging, choking]

1132
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:58,178
Well, well, Sheriff.

1133
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:01,617
What brings you back
to our little town?

1134
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:07,318
Couldn't bear to leave without
seeing Oleta one last time.

1135
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:10,103
Or did you forget,
she is my wife now.

1136
01:17:10,147 --> 01:17:12,671
You know damn well
what I'm doing here.

1137
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:15,587
You sacrificed them,
all of them,

1138
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,721
our whole town, for what?

1139
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:22,550
For wealth.
Haven't you taken enough
from this town?

1140
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:24,683
And from me?

1141
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:26,554
It was a terrible accident,
Sheriff.

1142
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:29,601
Like these men
you accidentally poisoned.

1143
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,821
Like I'm accidentally
going to kill you.

1144
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:33,736
Papi! Papi! [fires gun]

1145
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:37,391
[screaming]

1146
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:42,266
[grunts]

1147
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:46,183
[screaming, crying] 
Cabron!

1148
01:17:46,226 --> 01:17:48,751
Help me, Oleta!

1149
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,709
[sobbing]

1150
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:53,146
Luis, no!

1151
01:17:55,453 --> 01:17:58,543
Cabron!
[sobs]

1152
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:00,980
Luis, no!

1153
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:12,383
He had killed his only heir,
his beloved son,

1154
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:16,648
and was left with
a wife racked with grief
and a fool's fortune.

1155
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,869
He has spent the rest
of his eternal life

1156
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:22,828
in the penthouse,

1157
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:27,790
waited on dutifully by his wife
and stepdaughter

1158
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,401
who served his every need.

1159
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,760
The diary pages.

1160
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:51,683
[Martia] 
Everyone in our town 
who has died an unnatural death

1161
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,731
will return to walk again 
on Día de los Muertos.

1162
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:59,691
[Alicia] 
Martia, what do 
the dead want?

1163
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,649
Revenge.

1164
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:06,785
What's going on?

1165
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:08,787
What's it say? Dejalos entra.

1166
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:11,094
Babe, I don't speak Spanish."Let them in."

1167
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:14,358
Let them in?That's what the diary says,
"Let them in."

1168
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:17,709
Let them in?
What, are you crazy?Maybe.

1169
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:18,928
Wait.

1170
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:22,061
[cocks gun]Here.

1171
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:23,802
Give me a kiss.

1172
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:25,978
Alicia?Yeah.

1173
01:19:26,022 --> 01:19:27,675
I love you.

1174
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,982
I love you too.

1175
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:36,684
Shit!

1176
01:20:04,887 --> 01:20:06,105
Vargas Diaz?

1177
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:10,544
[Spanish]

1178
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:14,200
Callate. What?

1179
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:19,858
She is beautiful,

1180
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,819
like your daughter.

1181
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:25,864
In fact,

1182
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:30,826
do I detect
a family resemblance?

1183
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:38,877
All this, all the lives,

1184
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:41,793
all the people and
the suffering for this?

1185
01:20:43,795 --> 01:20:48,713
The great Vargas Diaz is nothing
more than a pampered child.

1186
01:20:53,196 --> 01:20:55,633
Tell me,

1187
01:20:55,676 --> 01:20:57,809
was eternal life
worth it?

1188
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:02,988
[pants]
I think so.
[growls]

1189
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:17,089
[shuddering]

1190
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:20,876
Worth it to taste
your young flesh.

1191
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:22,442
[whimpering]

1192
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:24,923
[hissing, moaning]

1193
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,494
[whimpering continues][sighs]

1194
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:38,067
[gasping, moaning]

1195
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:54,518
Enjoy it while
you can, asshole.
Company's coming.

1196
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:02,265
[zombies moaning]

1197
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:11,100
Stay away from me!

1198
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:18,411
I wanna live!
[shouting]

1199
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:20,544
[flesh tearing]

1200
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:24,113
[screaming]

1201
01:22:29,857 --> 01:22:32,556
Joss? Joss?

1202
01:22:33,731 --> 01:22:35,646
Joss!

1203
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:41,826
Joss!Right here, Alicia.

1204
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,874
[crying]

1205
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:01,889
I guess
they're all gone.

1206
01:23:01,933 --> 01:23:03,543
[Alicia]
Yeah.

1207
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:08,287
Martia, you must
come with us.I cannot.

1208
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:11,464
You can't stay here.

1209
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:15,468
Do you know why Oleta set
two plates on the night
