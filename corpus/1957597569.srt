Not like it was
because you're gay.

176
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:01,661
Okay.

177
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,265
I keep forgetting you're gay.

178
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,734
I keep forgetting it matters.

179
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,234
It doesn't, man.
It's just that...

180
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:14,339
- I mean, you weren't gay when we went into the haze.
- I was six.

181
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,109
I wasn't sure.

182
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:21,380
I didn't know it mattered, but it
does matter. At least out here anyway.

183
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,685
In my dream world, or the haze,
or whatever you want to call it.

184
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:30,589
I never even came out of the closet...
being gay or straight didn't exist.

185
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,190
You just hooked
up with whomever.

186
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:34,459
What if you wanted
to have a kid?

187
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:41,567
I had one.

188
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:44,804
You had a kid?

189
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:51,543
[laughs] Yeah.

190
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,178
Were you jerking off to Scout,

191
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:54,847
the little deaf girl
from across the way?

192
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:57,482
- She's not that little anymore.
- Neither are you.

193
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,352
Don't go changing the subject.

194
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:02,487
You never told me
you had a kid in the haze.

195
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:06,291
I've never really told any of you much
about what the haze was like for me.

196
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,829
Yeah, well, none of us really
ever talked much about it.

197
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,332
It's just weird. You know,

198
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,434
- we're not used to you being...
- A faggot.

199
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,435
No, gay.

200
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,138
It's been fucking
strange for this family.

201
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:23,676
It's been fucking strange
for the whole world.

202
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:28,380
I'll never forget Mom telling me that some
grown up made a drug that would let us go

203
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,751
into the haze and we would live
happier lives.

204
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,488
I would have anything
I could imagine, literally.

205
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,828
It sounded like that's what
I was supposed to do,

206
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,595
but I didn't get a choice.

207
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,198
The world had no choice.

208
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:50,569
They did, but they didn't.

209
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:55,340
You were probably too young to
remember, but we had to take the drug.

210
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,178
Anyone who was in power went into the
haze, I mean, look around.

211
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:01,814
The haze was better.

212
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,151
I do miss it.

213
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:12,324
I guess I never told you
about my kid because...

214
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:15,928
[sighs] ...I miss my son.

215
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:20,599
I mean, I know he wasn't real,
but he was real.

216
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,201
Stop being such a faggot.

217
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:27,472
[laughter]

218
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,476
[coughing]

219
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:32,879
[sighs]

220
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:38,617
- You should get that looked at.
- Yeah, by who, slut?

221
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:42,287
- Someone who gives a shit.
- [laughs] You know, ever since in my haze,

222
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:45,692
you and I still busted each
other's balls all the time.

223
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:48,795
- I don't have any balls, you ass.
- I'm the ass?

224
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:52,799
You're the one who basically dreamt
reality, you're so full of yourself.

225
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:57,369
The best thing you can come up with was you in
the real world as if the haze never existed.

226
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:01,239
- [laughs]
- I did not say that I dreamed reality.

227
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:05,477
- It wasn't exactly like that.
- Let's get back to you wanking off to that little deaf girl

228
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,547
- out the window.
- Wanking? When did you become British?

229
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:10,983
when I sucked tons of English
cock in the haze.

230
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,250
Eurgh!

231
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,657
- Out with it, chunky.
- Come on. You know I can't help that.

232
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:20,525
Shouldn't have been so proud
and paid for your own plan.

233
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,828
It's worth my pride.

234
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:26,498
Plus, we were never supposed to wake up.
And besides, watch the name calling.

235
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:29,802
- Fine, faggot.
- [chuckles] Touche.

236
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:35,307
You guys should have taken this super,
duper health plan that Dad took.

237
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,609
No way, that would have sucked.

238
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,212
I'd still look like I was six.

239
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:40,278
[chuckles]

240
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:43,750
Is it weird that Dad and I
basically look the same age?

241
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,855
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I
want to hear more about you wanking it

242
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:50,522
- to the little Scout.
- Oh, fuck off!

243
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:52,524
- [laughs]
- So here's the dish.

244
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,426
[Garp grunts]

245
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:56,963
[Augustine]
I walk in...

246
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:02,300
...Garp's in his undies, jerking it
with one hand, binoculars in the other.

247
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:04,036
He throws the binoculars at me.

248
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,774
- Ouch, are you okay by the way?
- Yes.

249
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,676
And somehow we still
have not discussed him

250
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,544
jacking off
to that little deaf girl.

251
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,681
[coughing]

252
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,016
God, I hate that.

253
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:19,952
Out with it.

254
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,054
Fine. I just want
to see her naked.

255
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,323
When I was in my haze,
I could do whatever I wanted.

256
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:27,693
I could go where I wanted,
I could eat what I wanted.

257
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:31,898
I could fuck when I wanted. If I wanted
to fuck eight girls, I fucked 16.

258
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,000
I was a king. I was a rock star.

259
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,839
- A glutton.
- Whatever. I'm proud of who I am and what I am.

260
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:44,977
I mean, in the haze I got to do whatever
I wanted. I mean, till two years ago

261
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:49,882
when Ward killed himself and that jackass
Zaphoid B. Esquire declared that nobody else

262
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:54,987
can legally make the drug and we've been out
of the haze and fucking on house arrest.

263
00:19:56,421 --> 00:20:00,726
Ever since that fateful fucking bullshit
day when I had to awake to that fucker

264
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:04,462
Lord Voraz telling me what I can and
can't do. No, no, shh, fuck that.

265
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:08,100
Ever since I woke to a world
full of lawyers with fucking guns

266
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,335
that tell me what I can
and can't do.

267
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:13,072
All... All I wanted is to see

268
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,942
little Scout Finch, who is no
longer so little by the way.

269
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,111
All I've wanted is
to see that hot girl get naked.

270
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:21,981
I haven't... I haven't
wanted to be a rock star.

271
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,548
I haven't wanted to be a king.

272
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,718
I haven't
wanted to fuck 16 girls.

273
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:30,522
I just want to see her get naked or
partially naked or fucking something!

274
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:37,763
And every night I come into my room,
I grab my binoculars and I shit in the dark

275
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:41,734
like the shitty old man
I've become and I watch her,

276
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:46,873
and I think, please shitty
world, please shitty world,

277
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:51,043
just let her get naked before she closes
the blinds. Every night I think it,

278
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:55,380
please don't close the blinds,
and every night she closes them.

279
00:20:57,582 --> 00:21:01,954
And every night I realized that the simplest
dream can't come true anymore and I want to die.

280
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:09,028
She closes the blinds and
my fat sickly ass wants to die.

281
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,138
Get naked.

282
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,610
- What?
- Get naked and get in front of the window.

283
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,650
If everyone in the world who wanted
to see naked people in the window

284
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,486
just stood naked in their windows,
then there will be plenty of naked people

285
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,456
in the windows. Get up,
get naked, be what you want.

286
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:40,826
All right.

287
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,460
I will.

288
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,766
Thank you.
That's all I'm saying.

289
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,769
- [grunts]
- [Solsbury] Whoa! No, no, no...

290
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:52,004
- Ha-ha!
- Not now!

291
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,706
Yeah!

292
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:03,115
Hey. Hey, guys, come here.
She's opening her blinds.

293
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,119
[laughing]

294
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:11,791
[laughter]

295
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:34,714
I'll be damned.

296
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,549
What do you make of that?

297
00:22:41,988 --> 00:22:45,891
- Today is officially two new A.D.
- That's right.

298
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:50,528
Time sure does fly. Two years ago
to this day in the year of our Ward,

299
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:57,502
Ward took his own life at the tender age
of 121 and left the hazers or druggies

300
00:22:57,602 --> 00:23:02,507
without their medicine and turned the
world upside down as he always did.

301
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:06,846
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- I want to hear this.

302
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:09,882
[woman reporter] He sure was a great
man and we all miss him dearly.

303
00:23:09,982 --> 00:23:14,020
Ward was running for President and was the
most beloved Americans since the ancient

304
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,289
Bobby Kennedy when he shocked
the world by attempting suicide.

305
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:19,959
Goddamn TV Sniggle.

306
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:27,599
The world cried for Ward until six
months after that suicide attempt,

307
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,802
when he made
that fateful speech.

308
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,972
- Hello.
- Remember that, hun?

309
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:35,841
- [Ward] No matter how much I've had in life...
- What?

310
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:40,913
...no matter how much I achieve, I...
I've always felt alone,

311
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:45,317
I tried to kill myself because
nothing made me happy anymore.

312
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:49,554
I was going to be the President
of the United States of America,

313
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:54,126
the country I love, and still
nothing would bring me joy.

314
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:57,863
I asked myself,
what is the meaning of life?

315
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,900
I didn't ask it
in a large worldly way.

316
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,569
But in a simple way,
I asked for the definition.

317
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:09,208
I think scientists believe life is an
organism that uses oxygen or water.

318
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:15,580
I mean, years ago when they sent those
probes to space, that's how scientists

319
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,650
looked for life,
by looking for water.

320
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:24,290
But they never found life,
and I decided they probably never would.

321
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:31,864
I mean, if they look by looking for
water, that's not what life is.

322
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,901
I mean, if something walked up to
me and said, "Hi, Ward, how are you?

323
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:36,869
How are you doing today?"

324
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,906
And it... it didn't
need oxygen or water,

325
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,908
I would still consider it alive.

326
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,010
Fuck!

327
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:49,315
[device clatters]

328
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:51,383
...decided that the scientific

329
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:53,352
definition of life was wrong.

330
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:57,723
I decided that the meaning
of life was what I feel,

331
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:01,260
and if all I was going to feel
was horrible all the time,

332
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,028
why would I want to keep living?

333
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:07,333
So, I decided to commit suicide.

334
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:12,638
When I woke up in the hospital
and my doctor told me

335
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:16,742
everything was going to be okay,
I reached out to take his hand.

336
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:21,113
I realized he was a hologram
from a remote TV Sniggle.

337
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:26,085
This made me know that I was
not connected to anyone.

338
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:32,925
I realized that with technology and Sniggles,
we have all withered into our own space.

339
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:38,864
I was actually considering suicide
again when when the doctor told me

340
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:42,001
about a successful suicide that
had taken place the day before.

341
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:47,840
It... it was a suicide of
a childhood friend of mine.

342
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:03,055
I thought if someone that grew up
where I grew up and how I grew up

343
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:08,327
could kill himself and... and we
couldn't understand it or stop it...

344
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:13,199
...then how could we understand
people in different places?

345
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:18,938
How could we understand things
larger than us or smaller than us?

346
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,275
Or more importantly, how could
we understand something like God

347
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:29,248
or an interconnected energy
or... or anything like that.

348
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:34,153
I realized...
life isn't what I feel.

349
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:37,189
It's what... what we all feel.

350
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:41,227
I wasn't depressed.
I was disconnected.

351
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:46,298
I want so badly to be connected, to have
meaningful relationships with others.

352
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:52,037
But today everyone is so caught
up in the world that exists

353
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,373
that I find it
no longer possible.

354
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:58,310
So, I have invented the drug.

355
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:01,380
And we all know
what happened from there.

356
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,251
The richest of the rich and the most
powerful people were on it until...

357
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:09,922
Until all the assholes who ruled the Earth,
like my father, gave away all their money

358
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:14,126
to lawyers so they could go on the drug until
those lawyers wanted to go on the drug too,

359
00:27:14,226 --> 00:27:18,364
so they deputized other lawyers to take
care of them and us and so on and so on.

360
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:23,769
Until goddamn 25% of the Earth was
deputized lawyers, and 50% of the people

361
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:30,009
were on a drug, and 25% of everyone
else took care of everything else!

362
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:33,345
- [Helmholtz] God, shut up!
- until the whole world was under one form of government

363
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:37,016
called contractualism,
and idiots ruled,

364
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:41,353
and ten percent of fuck was
fuck, and everything that sucked

365
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:45,190
just sucked and magic!
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

366
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,860
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!
- Shut up, Garp!

367
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,028
Fuck off.

368
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,934
You know, if you just
wouldn't let Ward be alone,

369
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:59,938
this never would've happened. The drug
didn't work on him. If he just interacted,

370
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,273
we wouldn't be in this mess.

371
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,015
[gentle guitar music]

372
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:23,195
Dad will never admit it. But they're
never going to ratify the contracts,

373
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,897
- they'll just leave this house.
- Don't say that.

374
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,166
They won't even let me pay
to eat healthy

375
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,068
or to change my clothes.

376
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:32,604
You're the one that chose
the cheap health food plan.

377
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:37,843
Well, I didn't think I was gonna have to
wake up and be a chunky, disheveled mess.

378
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:41,380
I didn't know I was going to have
to be sick from gas and junk food.

379
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,450
It doesn't matter now.

380
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:49,888
Fred Kinnan Esquire's never gonna let
Zaphoid B. Esquire ratify our contracts.

381
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:53,392
We're never gonna be free. We're never
going to be allowed to go outside.

382
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:54,526
How ludicrous is that?

383
00:28:56,161 --> 00:29:02,101
The Union of United Esquires, attorneys
with guns that control the entire world.

384
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,103
I mean, who could even
make that shit up?

385
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:11,076
One government that rules the world called
contractualism that forces everybody

386
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:13,979
to follow their contracts
or die is ludicrous.

387
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:19,585
Do you really think that
the Union of United Esquires

388
00:29:19,686 --> 00:29:22,254
is why the legal controller
won't ratify our contracts?

389
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,328
Sols, I had to yell "I desist"
with a fucking gun in my face.

390
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:35,234
I don't even think desist
should be a word.

391
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,907
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I want to be alone.

392
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:46,612
We're in my room.

393
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:51,550
Fine.

394
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,686

395
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:58,991

399
00:30:54,279 --> 00:31:00,586
I, Zaphoid B. Esquire, solemnly swear
that we are still working to ratify

400
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:06,058
these contracts. And we will try to meet
our deadline of January 8th, two New A.D.

401
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:06,992
Next week.

402
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,329
And now... I will take
a few questions.

403
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:13,031
Ready for press member
number one.

404
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:17,704
Is Fred Kinnan Esquire against
ratifications altogether?

405
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:20,773
Oh, you would have to ask him
that, but I would think not.

406
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,445
Is there ever a chance that the
contracts will all be nullified

407
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:29,716
and people can go back to being
what they want without fear of death

408
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:32,084
and... and... and...
and imprisonment within their own home?

409
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:36,488
I'm sorry. I can't hear you,
but I think I know what you're asking...

410
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:39,157
...will we ever go to...

411
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:42,060
[device beeps]

412
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:52,805
I am so sick
of being in this house.

413
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:55,708
[sighs]

414
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,080
[sighs]

415
00:32:05,852 --> 00:32:07,419
[whooshes]

416
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,125
- [chuckles]
- What's so funny?

417
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:16,428
Nothing. It's just... nothing.

418
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,297
Come on, out with it.

419
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:23,135
It's just, you're having a little
trouble with the makeup Sniggle.

420
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,337
- Goddamnit.
- Mom.

421
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:27,306
Sorry, it's just frustrating.

422
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,412
[whooshes]

423
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:37,583
Let me help you.

424
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:42,621
An old lady at 35.

425
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:45,557
[whooshes]

426
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:49,161
Not to dissuade your exuberance,
but you're 55, Mom.

427
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:53,098
Yeah, but I blinked when
I was 35 and awoke an old lady.

428
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,601
Must be strange for you.

429
00:32:56,736 --> 00:33:00,305
For all of us, we lived in dreams
that have more realistic time.

430
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,341
I just blinked.

431
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,746
What was it like to be gas?

432
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:09,649
It wasn't gas exactly.

433
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,819
Just kind of didn't exist.

434
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,688
It was like I was floating.

435
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:19,859
And there was nothing...

436
00:33:21,593 --> 00:33:22,594
...and everything.

437
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:26,598
It was.

438
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,870
[gentle guitar music]

439
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:39,879
[water running]

440
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,881
[grunts] Ow.

441
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:43,650
[Helmholtz]
You okay in there?

442
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,751
Fine.

443
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:48,253
You coming to bed?

444
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,256
Damn toothbrush Sniggle broke.

445
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:56,328
- Use mine.
- You know, in my dream,

446
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:59,666
we didn't even have to brush.
We were always just clean.

447
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:01,500
Everything was clean.

448
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,703
Everything was perfect.

449
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:10,208
[retches]

450
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:12,577
I can sense you're there.

451
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:14,647
What's wrong?

452
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:20,920
[chuckles] Nothing, babe.

453
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,656
Just so sick of
everything always breaking.

454
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:25,758
Breaking... Breaking...
[voice glitches]

455
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,827
- [laughter]
- Breaking...

456
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:33,498
What?

457
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:39,204
You mean me? I'm breaking.

458
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:43,575
No... [chuckles] Not you.

459
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:46,344
[exhales]

460
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:48,881
These damn Sniggles.

461
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,350
Our house.

462
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:55,688
Our futures.

463
00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:58,423
I can feel it.

464
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:02,294
Age was always
so important to you.

465
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,664
You're not
attracted to me anymore.

466
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:07,432
[scoffs] Yes, I am.

467
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:11,336
Then take me.

468
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,275
- I'm just not...
- You're not attracted to me.

469
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:22,581
D... Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I am.

470
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:23,850
That's bullshit.

471
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,887
While you were off living in a
world where we were young and hot,

472
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:29,756
I got old, old and blind.

473
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:34,526
Sure you got a little older.

474
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:38,765
But... you're still the most
beautiful girl in the world.

475
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:40,700
That's BS Helm, and you know it.

476
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,535
I may be blind
but I'm not blind.

477
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:49,041
When couples grow old together,
it works, the change is gradual.

478
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:55,982
You don't notice. But with us, you've
been gone for 20 years in some great dream

479
00:35:56,082 --> 00:35:57,717
in the haze with perfection.

480
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,587
In your world, we never aged.

481
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,327
We were just hot. And you woke
up looking that way.

482
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:15,802
You're a good man
and you try to hide it.

483
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:18,871
But you were and are vain.

484
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:23,375
I think being in the moment
is amazing.

485
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,779
I'm not as vain as you think.

486
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:30,683
What was that?

487
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,885
Oh, nothing.

488
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,323
For me, the haze
was a spectacular few seconds.

489
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,761
Then I wake up a second later,

490
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,997
I'm old, my husband doesn't want
me, my kids are all depressed,

491
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:47,834
I'm locked in the house and my
husband can't even have sex with me.

492
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:51,403
If that were true. [chuckles]

493
00:36:51,904 --> 00:36:53,438
Would I be this turned on?

494
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,910
[chuckles] Oh, Helmholtz,
I know that voice.

495
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,879
[Helmholtz moans loudly]

496
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,782
Oh, Helmholtz, oh!

497
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:04,884
Oh, Helmholtz!

498
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:07,086
- Oh!
- I want you so bad.

499
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,387
Okay, that's good.
Right there. Like that!

500
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:11,824
[moans] Oh, my...
I'm gonna come.

501
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,491
I'm coming.

502
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,360
Ah! I'm gonna come.

503
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,797
[both moaning loudly]

504
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:19,832
I'm gonna come. I'm coming!

505
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:23,135

815

Solsbury told me I should just
get naked and stand in the window.

816
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:53,505
She told me that if everybody in the
world who wanted to see naked people

817
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:56,275
in the window would just stand naked
in the window, then there'd be plenty

818
01:01:56,308 --> 01:02:01,280

So I got naked and she saw me and...

819

01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:09,121

- No. No, well, not right away anyway but she laughed.

01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:18,964
And since then for the last six
months we've been communicating.

823
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:20,933

as I am a single hardworking public servant.

no way we'll get these ratifications done.
