00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,472
You know, maybe you were
a demon yourself, huh?

182
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,207
Maybe you've got a
demon inside of you.

183
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,176
Tucker, what are talkin' about?

184
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:53,881
Well, I mean, uh... endangering
the lives of a whole city

185
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,082
Of innocent people.

186
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,118
That sounds pretty demonic
to me, how about you?

187
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,155
All you have to do is give
me that detonator, pal.

188
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:02,956
Why?

189
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,724
Why should I do that?

190
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,526
To prove you're
not one of them.

191
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,261
How else can I trust you?

192
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,033
Come on.

193
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,106
Give me the detonator.

194
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,107
Come on.

195
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,612

196
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:30,050
You know... Goddamn,
you're a good guy!

197
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,051
Give me the detonator.

198
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,491

but I got him.

I have a gun.

230

I can't see now.

236

Why don't you warn me next time?

237

And your right leg some more.

238

Oh, I get it.

So you're the shy type?

Now look, Buster this blood
crap was your idea, not mine.

256
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,410
But I tell you what.

257
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,781
I'll let you lick it off my
body for an extra $20 bucks?

258
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,683
That won't be necessary.

259

Hey, pud-knocker, it's
supposed to be $40 bucks.

You're an ordinary cop, Tucker.

269

You have been
trained in psychology

270

As well as forensics.

271
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,815
You're supposed to bring
me psychotics in alive,

272
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,916
Not blow them away.

273
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,519
I have to be alive
to do my job, sir.

274
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,821
I mean, last I heard, it
was still legal for a police

275

Officer to defend himself?

276
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,858
That's right, but
not with a gun.

277
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,760
Now, I have been covering for
you before this because you

278
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,162
Are a damn good cop.

279
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,330
But I am through
being jacked around.

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,233
Now I want that hand cannon
on my desk tomorrow morning.

You have been issued
an authorized weapon.

282

settle the gun issue,

285
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,440
Can we talk about
Luther Pantelli

286
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,142
And what the lab boys say?

287
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,348
The autopsy reports says
that he was pumped full

Of D-7 His body was like jello.

289
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,719
I pumped three
shots into this guy

290
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,821
And he still kept
coming after me.

291
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,858
You know, he's gotta be
on some new kind of drug.

292
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,495
Well if he is, uh,
we'll know that when

293

00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,225

MALE (OVER TV): We
interrupt this program

367
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,129
For a special bulletin.

368
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,966
Mrs. Claudia Granger, wife of
prominent local businessmen

369
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,669
Howard Granger and co-owner
of the Downy Corporation

370
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,606
Has been found brutally murder
in the hills above the city.

371
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,976
So far police say there are
no known suspects in the case.

372
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,444
The bizarre bullseye drawn
with the victims own blood

373
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,513
Suggests to investigators
that the murder

374
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,849
May be related to
the slaying of Mrs.

375
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,685
Jennifer Graham two weeks ago.

376
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:22,955
Her torso was slashed in a
pattern of concentric circles.

377
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,424
The police are so far
denying any connection

378
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,159
With the similar
murder of Mrs. Jennifer

379
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,564
Graham, whose body was also
marked with a bloody bullseye.

380
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,767
Mr. Granger has posted a
$10,000 reward for information

381
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,935
About this crime.

382
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,604

All right, all
right, all right.

388
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,693
Well, hello boys.

389
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,729
I though Halloween was over.

390
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,496
Fuck you, Tucker.

391
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,899

To express your inner feelings.

393
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,804
And as for you, Morris,
you need to learn how

394
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,173
To keep 'em bottled up inside.

395
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,842
Gauge wants to see you.

396
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:19,812
Oh, well, I was just on my way.

397
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,847
Uh, OK.

398
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:22,348
What are you guys
gonna do, carry me?

399
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:23,515
No, we're gonna frisk you.

400
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,419
You know, Kelsey,
I always thought

401
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,056
You had homoerotic tendencies.

402
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,258
Fuck you, Tucker.

403
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,626
OK, what are you
guys looking for?

404
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,427
An illegal drone.

405
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,329
Yeah, you got a warrant?

406
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,931
Now I'm gonna search
your apartment.

407
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,173
Hey Kelsey, while you're at
it, will you make up my bed?

408
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:47,974
Fuck you.

409
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,183
You're the spokesperson.

410
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,751
You tell 'em what
they wanna hear.

411
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,888
Tell 'em we got some leads
and we're checking them.

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,391

a bitch in here.

414
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,770
Take a seat, officer.

415
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,005
Thank you, sir.

416
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,676
You look like you
slept in the toilet.

417
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,844
Thank you, sir.

418
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,119
Did you read the Graham
and Ranger reports yet?

419
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,553
Uh, yes, sir.
I did.

420
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,354
Good.

421
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,958
'Cause you're on the case.

422
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,893
This is top priority.

423
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,662
If you trip on your dick, the
whole department stumbles.

424
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:44,563
Anything else, sir?

425
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,765
Yeah.

426
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,134
Got the final results of
Luther Pantelli's autopsy.

427
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,035
You were right.

428
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,202
It's a new chemical.

429
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,940
The lab boys think it's
a distant cousin to PCP.

430
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,008
They code named it Hombra.

431
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,544
It partly neutralized
the muscle relaxant.

432
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,412
That's why he kept coming.

The part of the brain that
controls the intelligence.

that, you'll love this.

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,799
A hooker called it in.

440

Said some John paid her to
pose in the same position

00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,335
We found the victim.

442
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,238
Even used phony blood to
draw the bullseye pattern.

443
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,408
Could be a wacko imitating
the Graham killing.

444
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,578
Or our suspect has been
practicing for another kill.

445
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,380
I got Hinkle running
cross-refs on the face,

446
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,748
But no positive ID.

447
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,851
If this is our man, we got a
turbo-charged fruit loop here.

448
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,319
And he is the whole enchilada.

449
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,323
The connection between Luther
Pantelli and our killer.

450
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,926
I want you working
in isolation on this.

451
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,628
Nobody except you, me
and Hinkle will know

452
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,997
This guy could be a repeater.

453
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,664
Otherwise, the media will blow
this thing out of proportion

454
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,868
And make this job a bigger pain
in the ass than it already is.

455
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,837
I'm the wrong man
for the job, sir.

456
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,138
What are you talking about?

457
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,874
I mean the suspect probably
slipped Luther Pantelli

458
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,742
The drug to whack him out.

459
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,577
Which means he knew the
Grangers well enough

460
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,880
To know when Mrs. Granger
was getting back into town

461
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,949
And who their chauffeur was.

462
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,617
That's premeditated murder.

463
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:12,684
That's murder one.

464
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:15,321
That means I'm the
wrong man for the job.

465
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,823
I only handle crazies.

466
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,959
Our suspect still fits the
legal profile of a crazy.

467
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,794
And you're the best man
to predict his pattern

468
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:22,962
And bring him in
so he doesn't have

469
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,530
A chance to act it out again.

470
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,900
But no other cops and
no press, except Hinkle.

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,602
Now, you'll have priority access
on your usual coded frequency.

472
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,038
Anything else?

473
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,372
Yeah.

474
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,207
Well?

475
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,743

when I run into this geek?

You listen to me, Tucker.

478
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,217
I'm not going to alter
anymore autopsy reports

479
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,953
Just to cover your ass.

480
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,121
If you shoot somebody
for any reason,

481
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,890
I'm gonna turn you
over to the wolves.

482
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,757
All right?

483
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:52,992
Bad PR or not.

484
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,927
Now, you're gonna be
issued a new stinger.

485
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,362
Used properly, that
you do the trick.

486
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,297
Look, if the suspect
is taking the same drug

487
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:02,434
Luther Pantelli is, these
tranquilizers won't do diddly.

488
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,104
We're not as dumb as
you think we are, Tucker.

489
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,206
The lab boys doubled the dosage.

490
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,676
A couple of well-placed
shots should do the trick.

491
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,744
That should be enough.

492
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,313
Anything else?

493
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,681
No, what more could a guy want?

494
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:19,986
Get this slime, Tucker.

495
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,287
Before he has the
chance to kill again.

496
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,222
That M all look like clowns.

497
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,459
Yeah, we wouldn't wanna
start a trend, now would we?

498
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,196
Excuse me, I wanna talk to
you about Luther Pantelli.

499
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,163
Andrea, I don't have time.

500
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,865
Besides, it's over
and done with.

501
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,266
Not quite.

502
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,436

my committee for investigation.

00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,570
Um, Mrs. Andrea Layton.

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,607
She's with the
prosecutor's office.

505
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,443
And chairperson of some, uh,
arrest procedure committee

506
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:45,711
Or something like that.

507
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,746
We're city-authorized
watchdog committee rooting out

508
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,481
Those officers who
have not yet adjusted

509
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,283
To new arresting procedures.

510
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,285
And if we don't stop these
abuses against suspects,

511
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,087
We won't be able
successfully prosecute.

512
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,928
Who are you?

513
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:05,097
Uh, this is officer
James Tucker.

514
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,133
The notorious James Tucker?

515
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,400
You know, there's a
rumor going around

516
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,970
That you have an illegal
weapon and used it to violate

517
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,404
Luther Pantelli's civil rights.

518
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,075
That's very funny.

519
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,843
Isn't that funny, Commander?

520
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:21,313
The lab tech in forensics
says the autopsy was altered.

521
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,115
His body was cremated.

522
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,317
So you squeaked by this
time, but next time

523
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,919
I'm gonna put you away.

524
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,122
Yeah, why don't you try putting
the criminals away, Ms. Layton?

525
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,324
Oh, I've put a lot
criminals away, Mr. Tucker.

526
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,993
Yeah, you put 'em
out in the clinics,

527
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,694
You give 'em a few
behavior mod shots

528
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,896
And, boom, they're out
cruising the streets again.

529
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,632
It's not my fault.
That's the law.

530
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,334
No, that's compromise.

531
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,771
You can't take the heat,
get out of the system.

532
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,539
Why don't I start by
getting out of the room?

533
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,557
Hinkle, come in.

534
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,093

about going out with women?

Is that we know that
Stillmore and the training

make this Hombra.

it, the public will believe it.

00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,395
My communications were out.

719
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,231
Why don't we plea
special circumstances?

720
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:27,598
I tried that.

721
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,634
The DA said too many courts have
been overturning convictions

722
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,469
Based on special circumstances.

723
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,338
All we can do is get
him for experimenting

724
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,006
With unapproved chemicals.

725
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,542
They'll wash out the Hombra
and surgically implanted

726
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,177
Government-issued downer.

727
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:41,279
He'll be sleep-walking
for a year.

728
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:44,615
Andrea, this guy Stillmore
is a hot-shot chemist.

729
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,252
I mean, he's made a drug that
neutralizes police stingers.

730
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:50,888
If he can do that, he can make a
drug to neutralize the downers.

731
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,958
Now, he's been killing these
woman and I don't know why.

732
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:56,227
And nobody seems to care.

733
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,828
But if you let him
go, he's gonna go out

734
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:58,729
And carve another bullseye.

735
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,131
You can count on it.

736
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:04,402
Got a towel?

737
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:16,013
Why did you have to
kill Granger's wife?

738
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,816
He was late on a shipment.

739
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,018
You know it takes time to
manufacture that base chemical

740
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,021
And you have kept
asking for more.

741
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,791
Excuses can be costly.

742
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:27,992
Granger found that out.

743
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:30,295
So did Graham.

744
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,962
If you don't stop, I'm
gonna cut off your supply.

745
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,635
Shall I called the
police and tell them

746
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,138
About your little experiments?

747
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,773
Oh, they'll slap
your hand, I know.

748
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,244
But in the corporate world,
the concept of retribution

749
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,746
Is still operant.

750
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,815
You'll be ostracized.

751
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,318
They'll take away your pension.

752
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:56,554
Your club membership.

753
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,589
A fate worse than death.

754
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:02,093
[Laughs]

755
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,461
Why do you need so much?

756
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,995
You've got enough to satisfy
your addiction for a lifetime.

757
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,467
Since you people
aren't interested

758
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,870
In the commercial
value of my formula,

759
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,672
I'm going into
business for myself.

760
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:16,541
[Laughs]

761
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,908
You bastard.

762
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,777
You know what Hombra
will do to people?

763
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:21,546
True, it's wonderful.

764
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,013
When will the shipment be ready?

765
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,883
I have orders to fill.

766
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:26,684
By next week.

767
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:33,090
I think, by the
day after tomorrow.

768
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,058
I'll pick it up personally.

769
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:39,930
What if you're being watched?

770
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,133
Oh, I will be.

771
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:43,067
But it won't matter.

772
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:49,340
You have a lovely
wife, Germaine.

773
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:54,245
Good day.

774
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,759
Gotta nail that son
of a bitch to the wall.

775
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,695
And I'm gonna use
the system to do it.

776
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,029
FEMALE (OVER RADIO):
Attention units.

777
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,164
What is that?

778
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,665
FEMALE (OVER RADIO): We
have a 2-11 in progress.

779
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:15,933
Highland South.

780
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:17,435
Three males, armed with guns.

781
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:23,174
This is Tucker, 9-211 I'm
in the area and I'll take it.

782
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,643
Hang on.

783
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:29,079
[Music playing]

784
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:38,956
Get down!

785
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,678
Nobody move!

786
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,012
Drop the bag.

787
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,248
I'll be forced to shoot.

788
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:19,630
April Fool's.

789
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:44,622
Drop those guns.

790
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:49,260
Looks like somebody else
wants to play these games, too.

791
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,998
Too bad cops aren't
allowed to carry guns.

792
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,500
That's the rules.

793
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:01,005
New rules.

794
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:08,513
Tucker.

795
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,593
So what're you gonna
tell your committee?

796
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,166
Guess I'll tell 'em to
mind their own business.

797
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,372
I think we should get out of
here before the sirens get

798
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:35,172
Any closer.

799
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,143
MALE (ON TV): Ladies
and gentlemen,

800
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,211
The Sally Winfrey Show.

801
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,414
And here's Sally.

802
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,214
Yes, Commissioner.

803
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:45,316
It's just about to start.

804
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:50,388
SALLY (ON TV): Officer Tucker,
do police dart guns protect you

805
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,757
From a criminal using stolen
military or black market

806
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:53,924
Weapons?
TUCKER (ON TV): Well, I...

807
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,360
SALLY (ON TV): I mean,
doesn't this gun ban

808
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,861
Put the police at an
enormous disadvantage?

809
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:57,895
TUCKER (ON TV): Well...

810
00:54:57,995 --> 00:54:58,996
SALLY (ON TV): Some
police departments

811
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:00,297
Throughout the country
are going on strike

812
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,732
Rather than go out
on the street with

813
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,167
Those little plastic stingers.

814
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,903
Is your department
considering such action?

815
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,271
TUCKER (ON TV): No.

816
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:10,808
SALLY (ON TV): Would you go
out on strike, Officer Tucker?

817
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,210
TUCKER (ON TV): No, ma'am.

818
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,546
SALLY (ON TV): Why not?

819
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:20,217
TUCKER (ON TV): Well, um...
'cause it wouldn't do any good.

820
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,886
SALLY (ON TV): What would?

821
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,821
TUCKER (ON TV): Giving law
enforcement back their weapons.

822
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:30,428
Putting guns back in
the hands of the people

823
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:31,896
That are paid to
protect the city.

824
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,167
Hi, Commander.

825
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,603
[Laughter]

826
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:45,710
SALLY (ON TV): Can we please
go to a commercial now?

827
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,613
[Phone ringing]

828
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,548
COMMISSIONER (ON PHONE): Gauge,
goddammit, I want you to...

829
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:52,116
Yes, commissioner.

830
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:54,685
I understand I'm sorry, sir.

831
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:02,059
The shipment is late.

832
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,761
MALE (OVER PHONE):
I Told you to stop.

833
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,896
I've just begun.

834
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,364
No one can stop me, now.

835
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:08,265
I can.

836
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,400
If you kill one
more time, I will.

837
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,300
You son of a bitch.

838
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,502
Try it.

839
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:15,506
And I'll tell everyone
what a killer you are.

840
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,808
Now I want that shipment.

841
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,644
You know that in
its virgin state

842
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,345
The chemical is highly volatile.

843
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:24,114
You can't rush the process
without risking an explosion.

844
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,951
I've got to have it to mix
it into the final formula

845
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,420
Before I can transport Friday.

846
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,957
MALE (OVER PHONE): If I don't
have what I want by morning,

847
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:36,093
I'll have to take steps to
ensure your cooperation.

848
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:37,795
MALE (OVER PHONE): All
right, all right, all right.

849
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,031
I'll... I'll have
half of it ready.

850
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,434
Only half, Germaine?

851
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:44,401
It's the best I can do.

852
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,207
[Dial tone]

853
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:34,845
Oh, fuck you... Tucker.

854
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,858
Now Tucker, what do
you wanna do that for?

855
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:48,926
He'll be all right.

856
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,296
He can just consider
it an extra day off.

857
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,198
So when are you guys
gonna leave me alone?

858
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,834
When we get that gun.

859
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:57,635
Got a warrant for you.

860
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,028
Come on, Morris.

861
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:27,665
You're gonna piss my maid off.

862
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,999
Look, Tucker.

863
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,768
Give us the gun, you won't
have to go through all of this.

864
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:46,583
Tucker.

865
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,954
How can you live like this?

866
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,055
I guess I'm just lucky.

867
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,497
I know that gun's
around here somewhere.

868
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,067
You know, Morris, you just
looked in here last week.

869
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,845
That was last week.

870
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:23,553
You fuckin' rat.

871
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:30,194
He doesn't know he's a rat.

872
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:31,361
He thinks he's a dog.

873
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,036
Freud, come on, Freud.

874
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:39,837

01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:45,409
Go on.

876
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:51,348
Hey, you finished?

877
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:52,149
Not quite.

878
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,151
Gauge wants to talk to you.

879
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,519
About what?

880
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:56,553
They found another bullseye.

881
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,406
We got another victim, Tucker.

882
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,574
Similar MO.

883
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,543
She was strangled, that stabbed.

884
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:22,579
Those are burn marks, not blood.

885
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,449
The suspect just poured
lines of kerosene

886
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:28,919
And then set them on fire.

887
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,889
Is that our man?

888
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,058
What's the victim's profile?

889
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:34,992
Monica Cantrell.

890
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:35,793
Rich.

891
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:36,994
Divorced.

892
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:37,795
Hm.

893
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,830
Could be Stillmore.

894
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,331
Did we pick him up?

895
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,132
We can't

896
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:44,068
Why not?

897
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:45,369
He's got an alibi.

898
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:48,806
A witness who says he
never left town that night.

899
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:51,641
Who?

900
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:53,110
Us.

901
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,378
What?

902
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:55,312
Yep.

903
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:58,115
I put a man on
him night and day.

904
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,484
When he was released.

905
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,786
It's all there.

906
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:03,187
Where he's been the
last five weeks.

907
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:04,488
A model citizen.

908
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:06,957
Boot to the city, got a job
at some electronics firm.

909
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:11,595
Developing etching compounds for
liquid circuitry or something.

910
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:13,197
I was about to call
up surveillance

911
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,298
When this happened.

912
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,333
Read the entry on the 16th.

913
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:17,534
OK.

914
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,603
Subject played music until
10:00, called a coworker

915
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:22,406
And talked about some technical
problem for over two hours,

916
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:23,607
And went to bed.

917
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:26,543
Got up the next morning
and drove himself to work.

918
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:29,213
When was the time of death?

919
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:30,280
8:16 PM.

920
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,215
Puzzling.

921
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:32,016
Copycat killer?

922
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:35,652
I guess it must be.

923
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:41,859
Tucker, I'm gonna call off
the surveillance on Stillmore.

924
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:09,719
Do you think he could
be having an affair?

925
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,488
Thought did cross
my mind, you know?

926
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,057
Well, I went into his
office the other day

927
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:15,459
And I've never seen
him look so distracted.

928
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:19,329
Well, when I asked him, he said
the company profits were fine.

929
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,664
No.

930
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:22,332
He even said that we would
be able to take a little trip

931
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,767
Together real soon.

932
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:26,536
Yeah.

933
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,571
You know what?

934
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:28,839
My masseur Georgio is here.

935
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:29,639
I gotta go.

936
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,779
Hi.

937
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,314
Is Georgio sick again?

938
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,383
Yes

939
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:40,350
Come on in.

940
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,759
Feels good.

941
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,729
[Moaning]

942
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,100
So, um, what's
wrong with Georgio?

943
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,303
He's feeling a little
under the weather.

944
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,973
Your hands feel so good.

945
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:36,773
Mm.

946
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:44,714
[Phone ringing]

947
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,657
Hello?

[Indistinct]

949
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:56,626
What?

[Indistinct]

951
01:04:58,595 --> 01:04:59,396
Where?

[Indistinct]

953
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,766
When?

954
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:03,900
That's impossible.

955
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:06,136
I was watching his place
all night last night.

956
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,005
[Indistinct]

957
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:09,373
Yes sir, I'm on my way.

958
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,115
And don't forget to lock
up when you leave, now.

959
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:26,023
FEMALE (OVER RADIO): 49-211.

960
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:27,424
Looks like we've got
another bullseye at...

961
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,159
Mr. Tremaine?

962
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,328
Where were you last night?

963
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:06,930
I was at the office.

964
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:07,931
So late?

965
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:11,035
There's a lot of work to do.

966
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,037
Do you remember
a former employee

967
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:16,006
By the name of Glenn Stillmore?

968
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,841
I need another drink.

969
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:19,576
It's important.

970
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:22,312
He was a top-notch chemist
for the Downy corporation

971
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:23,380
And he was fired.

972
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,414
Why?

973
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,083
I don't keep track
of all my employees.

974
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,452
People come and they go.

975
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:30,087
My wife has just been killed.

976
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:31,221
I'm not in the mood.

977
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,222
Excuse me.

978
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:56,580
Elgar.

979
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,651
Hi, Doc.

980
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:02,452
Elgar.

981
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,954
You look like hell.

982
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:06,256
Thanks, Elgar.

983
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,059
I hear you've been carrying
a new illegal weapon.

984
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:42,292
Every load, government issue.

985
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,527
The master.

986
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:47,631
Oh, I was once when
they let me deal guns.

987
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:50,967
Can you make some
more of these?

988
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,569
I don't know.

989
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,472
I would have to cobble
some equipment together.

990
01:07:55,572 --> 01:08:00,043
The Feds confiscated all I
had when the anti-gun law went

991
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:01,845
Into effect.

992
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:04,214
Oh, it would take some
time and I would be

993
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:06,483
Duck squat if they caught me.

994
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:22,799
Elgar.

995
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:24,634
I'll pay you.

996
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,903
Whatever it takes.

997
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:29,606
What is money to
an old man like me?

998
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:36,079
But I could stand a little
adventure in my life.

999
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:39,549
Thanks, Elgar.

1000
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:47,491
Hey, Tuck.

1001
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:50,694
Where you been hiding this?

1002
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:54,097
Now, you really don't
wanna know, do you?

1003
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:54,998
Well, don't worry.

1004
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:58,502
I, uh... I wrapped it in plastic.

1005
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:13,550

1006
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,551

01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:21,491

1008
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:25,529
Just shut up and give me
phone traffic on Stillmore.

01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:28,164
Oh wait, one sec, my love.

1010
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:31,635
So, you been thinking
about your choice?

1011
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:33,570
What choice?

1012
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,772
Meat loaf or spinach quiche.

1013
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,508
Oh, I can't get it off my mind.

1014
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:39,476

the last 45 minutes.

1016
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,685

01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:51,688
Um, audio analysis
confirms it's your man.

01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,258
When are you gonna take a break?

1020
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,425

authorized surveillance?

1023
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:02,466
You know, every time I
call, you're always there.

1024
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:03,533
Day or night.

1025
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:06,803
I mean don't you ever go to bed?

1026
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,004
Is that an invitation?

1027
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:14,278
Good night, Hinkle.

1028
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,745

Did I come at a bad time?

1045
01:11:32,356 --> 01:11:33,890
You see, he's
killed four women.

1046
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,860
Two of 'em that we know right
up underneath our noses.

1047
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,995
And everybody thought it
was the work of a crazy.

1048
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:41,731
Yeah, he is crazy when
he's on the Hombra.

1049
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,400
But I think he
has another reason

1050
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,370
For making those killings.

1051
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,639
So there's some connection
between these women?

1052
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:50,940
Yeah.

1053
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:51,741
Look.

1054
01:11:54,578 --> 01:11:57,146
I still don't see it.

1055
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,783
The first victim,
she was remarried.

1056
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:03,152
But her first husband,
his occupation was?

1057
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:04,721
Downy chemical.

1058
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,522
Right.

1059
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,824
The second victim.

1060
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:10,827
Her husband was the chairman of?

1061
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,295
Downy chemical corporation.

1062
01:12:12,396 --> 01:12:13,430
And the third...

1063
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,632
And the third was Mr.
Tremaine's secretary.

1064
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:18,234
Now, he must've been
having an affair.

1065
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,804
And the fourth
was Mrs. Tremaine.

1066
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:21,605
Mm-hmm.

1067
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:23,373
But why go after the women?

1068
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,208
Why not kill the board members?

1069
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,643
They're the ones that fired him.

1070
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:29,345
Because they're wealthy
and they're powerful.

1071
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,481
But they have heavy security.

1072
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:35,184
Now, the women... they're
easily accessible.

1073
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,020
Especially the mistress.

1074
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,024
And besides, uh... he
loves to kill women.

1075
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:42,826
And he won't stop.

1076
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:44,193
No.

1077
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,463
So we have to figure
out how he did it.

1078
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:47,664
Right.

1079
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:52,902
But, Ms. Layton, we might
have to break the law.

1080
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:54,871
Now, how do you feel about that?

1081
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,156
Look, the basement.

01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,324
Well, what do you know?

1089
01:15:02,566 --> 01:15:03,800
Now all we have to
do is figure out

1090
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,402
How to get out of this
place without being seen.

1091
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:12,308
There must be some kind of
trap door around here somewhere.

1092
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:32,228
That's it.

1093
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:33,563

01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:57,353
I was about to ask
you the same question.

1097
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:59,255
I wanna talk to my attorney.

1098
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:02,091
You're gonna need an attorney
where you're going to, pal.

You're under arrest.

1102
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,132
I wanna talk to you.

1105
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:25,048
He just broke in to
Stillmore's apartment.

1106
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:26,015
So did we.

1107
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:40,363

I'm not going to arrest you.

Instead, I'm going to
beat the shit out of.

1110
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,244
And why am I going to
beat the shit out of you?

1111
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,345
Because I can't sleep at night.

1112
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,613
And why not?

1113
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,148
Because there's a lot of
innocent women getting killed.

1114

And unless you give me
answers, I'm going to make

OK, I'll tell you.

But not here, somewhere safe.

1119
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,772
Two years ago, Stillmore
came to the, uh, board

1120
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:25,041
With a formula for a new
intelligence booster,

1121
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,810
Which he called Hombra.

1122
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:29,512
And we ran our own
tests and eventually

1123
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:32,749
Evidence of side-effects made
it, uh, commercially unviable.

1124
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:34,751
What kind of side-effects?

1125
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:37,353
Delusions of grandeur.

1126
01:17:37,453 --> 01:17:38,788
Muscle spasms.

1127
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:39,588
Hyper-activism.

1128
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:42,458
Uh, paranoia.

1129
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:45,995
S... Sometimes death.

1130
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:47,897
It's a powerful addictive.

1131
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:50,666
I think that, uh, Stillmore
had been into his own stock

1132
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,201
For some time.

1133
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:57,941
The, uh, Hombra made him,
uh, brilliant but psychotic.

1134
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,076
And he threatened
us with exposure

1135
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,145
If we didn't, uh,
continue to, uh, make

1136
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:04,848
The basic chemicals so he
could have enough Hombra

1137
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:06,082
For his own addiction.

1138
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:16,059
So... We, uh, supplied him
with enough base chemicals

1139
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,693
Just to keep him happy.

1140
01:18:17,794 --> 01:18:20,363
But he demanded more and more.

1141
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:25,634
Then we realized he was
selling it on the street

1142
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:28,704
And we refused to...
To give my anymore.

1143
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:35,244
He went into a rage and
he, uh, he started to kill.

1144
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:37,546
Until we supplied him with more.

1145
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,215
TUCKER (ON TV): Does
Stillmore look like a priest?

1146

1147
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:41,818
I... I'll tell you.

1148
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:43,652
But not here, somewhere
where it's safe.

1149
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:53,529
You said Stillmore is
trying to expose you?

1150
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:58,234
I... It's routine for us to
pay poor people to, uh, act

1151
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:04,707
As our Guinea pigs for the... the
final stages of... of testing.

1152
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:08,577
And, in this case
we, uh, skipped

1153
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,614
The preliminary lab tests.

1154
01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:17,520
And several people, uh,
suffered bad reactions.

1155
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,155
And one died.

1156
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,858
Did Stillmore know about this?

1157
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,192
Yeah.

1158
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:26,662
Uh, we, uh, we tried
to destroy our records.

1159
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,264
So that was the fire?

1160
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:29,332
Yeah.

1161
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,101
Uh, but he, uh, he
anticipated our actions

1162
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:37,640
And... had made photocopies of
all... all the records and we,

1163
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:41,210
Uh, cooperated just
keep him quiet.

1164
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,980
Who was he selling to?

1165
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,382
He, uh, flies the
Hombra to Oceanside.

1166
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:50,619
We believe they're
mob-related drug dealers.

1167
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,457
They're starting to sell
it all over America.

1168
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:56,459
It could create a
whole new crime wave.

1169
01:19:56,559 --> 01:20:01,530
And... And the Hombra it
neutralizes the police tranqs.

01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,500
If he isn't caught,
there are gonna

psychotic addicts

shipment today at 10 o'clock,

1174

And if he gets that
shipment to Oceanside,

1175
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,713
There's enough to
wipe out a whole city.

One other thing.

1177
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:23,086
The Hombra is
highly combustible.

it's even more flammable.
