I know.
We're shutting this down.

You don't wanna shut the party down.
You wanna join us.

came, I thought you were strippers?

00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,267

you are setting yourself

60
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,836

it's a fucking costume party.

67
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,893
Oh, no, no, no.
She sleeps through anything.

68
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,461
Yes, you do.

69
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,895
When the babysitter bailed, Glenn and I were
like, 'Fuck it. ” We have missed every party.

70
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,058
No way we're missing
the White Trash Bash.

71
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,762

bachelorette weekend?

75
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,578
Yeah!
I think it's gonna be

76
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,613

00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,446

00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,588
Oh.
Sorry.

79
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,157
That's gonna be fine.
That's totally fine.

00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,588

you guys seen Duquez?

84
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,983
Will you relax
with the doughnuts?

85
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,283
Oh, sweetie, I want to. I'm trying to push
the savory and all they want is the sweet.

86
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,685
I promise you
no one cares.

87
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,123
Hey. Where the fuck
are the doughnuts?

88
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,620

D. Duquez is AWOL.

90
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,633

Yeah. I'm not seeing
any doughnuts.

169
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,136
You specifically
said get the glazed.

170
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,647
They didn't have glazed.
I tried. There was jelly.

171
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,116
There was Boston cream.
Jelly, Boston cream.

172
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,154
Eric, I have a whole package
of ginger candies in my bag.

173
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,458
Hi, Willow.

174
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,651
Mmm, thank you.
But we're gonna be okay.

175
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,659
McCRUDDEN:
I found you a big brown naked!

176
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,729
I can't get it off!
I can't shake it off!

177
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,526
Hey, everybody
naked in the pool.

178
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,341
Well, that's a half hour
ahead of schedule.

179
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,839
Yeah! Anybody?

180
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,412
Anybody?

181
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,913
Oh, you all suck.
Chickenshit.

182
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,382
Want me to go to Brent's?
Pick up Entenmann's?

183
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,576
Don't worry about it.

184
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,653
Now I'm gonna go jump
in that pool

185
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,757
because McCrudden
is dying in there alone.

186
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,018
That's what friends do.
See, they don't leave each other hanging.

187
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,527
Where's your patriotism?

188
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,720
My man.

189
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,388
I got you.

190
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,530
My fucking BlackBerry.

191
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,553
Dad, what are you
doing here?

192
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,460
Uh, hmm.

193
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,727
Oh, yeah, I own the place.
Cherie, this is my son, Eric.

194
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,098
Hi.
He's told me all about you.

195
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,299
Ah, yeah.

196
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,704
Great party. Thanks for
letting us sleep it off.

197
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,539
No problem.

198
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,409
Hm. It must have been
quite a fiesta.

199
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,742
Oh, yeah,
I guess so.

200
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,578
Did the best I could
with the turds.

201
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,244
I know you did, Bill. I wish you would
have let me know you were coming out.

202
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,448
Maybe we can throw someone
down on a couch.

203
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,092
Ah, we're not staying.

204
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:26,628
I just came out for the day to do a
meet-and-greet with the brokers.

205
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,890
Brokers?

206
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,829
You got the message, right?

207
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,933
I saw that you called.

208
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,093
I'm putting the house
on the market.

209
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,165
What? Wait, you're selling
our house?

210
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,641
Ah, I'm hardly ever
out here anymore.

211
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,281
It's time to unload.

212
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,677
But hey, what about me?

213
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,945
I'm always out here.
My friends are always out here.

214
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,317
So make me an offer.

215
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,548
Ah. Ha-ha-ha.

216
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,121
Dad, come on.
I don't ask you for anything.

217
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,160
How about this?
We go get breakfast.

218
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,956
We talk over
the house situation.

219
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,191
Maybe we all can chip in
for utilities?

220
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,301
Ah, I'm a little pressed
for time, kiddo.

221
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,962
We're gonna go play a quick nine
and then gotta get back.

222
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,836
Cherie's never played before.

223
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,305
I'm so excited.

224
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,968
Dad, this is fucking bullshit.

225
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,138
I'll call you next week.
We'll do yoga.

226
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,156
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

227
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,889
Your dad is a selfish prick.

228
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,033
Smoothie?
Ooh.

229
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,226
It's gonna be sad
not coming out here.

230
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,837
Me and Willy might not
even be around next summer.

231
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,338
The L.A. thing again?
Are you serious?

232
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,499
You just moved into
that place in Brooklyn.

233
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,906
But Willow's doing really
good with her acting.

234
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,809
She did that Pizza Hut
Latin America commercial.

235
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,008
Ooh, deliciosa!

236
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,182
Her dad is gonna hook me up
with a job at a big law firm.

237
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,550
What about the album?

238
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,714
I'll work on the album
while I'm doing law.

239
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,225
Yeah? Will you?
You know what I'm excited about?

240
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,262
Throwing one of these parties
in my one-bedroom apartment.

241
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,762
That'll be fun, right?

242
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,367
Maybe I can put
the food out on the fire escape.

243
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,367
Eric.
The band in the bathroom.

244
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,869
I have to get more outlets.

245
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,337
I'll get a power strip.
Why not? I'll splurge.

246
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,907
Eric.
What?

247
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,407
This is a major moment.

248
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,103
It's okay to let the hurt in.

249
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,341
To allow yourself to actually
be present in a moment.

250
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,247
Okay, thanks, doc. You really
make the moment more real

251
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,048
by talking about how real
the moment is in the middle.

252
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,215
No, I understand.
You're probably feeling

253
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,588
some anger and some
misdirected frustra-

254
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,387
Feel better now?
A little bit, yeah.

255
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,192
Dude, that was awesome.
Oh, fuck!

256
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,390
Oh!

257
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,900
What about now?

258
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,196
Oh, much better.

259
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,993
Now I'm in the moment.

260
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,735
McCRUDDEN: I don't
understand summer school.

261
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,572
Isn't the point of being a teacher
that you get summers off?

262
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,908
Well, they pay us poop, so,
what am I gonna do, waitress?

263
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,551
Oh, my God, the big news.

264
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,916
So the principal told me today

265
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:10,493
that the friendship bracelets that the girls
are wearing are actually sex bracelets.

266
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,753
Hmm.
What?

267
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,919
I saw something
about that on Oprah.

268
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,259
Girls we r these different
color bracelets

269
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,266
and every color represents,
like, a sex thing.

270
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,928
So if you tear off a girl's
blue bracelet,

271
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,937
that means
she has to give you oral.

272
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,769
Yup.
What's a yellow bracelet?

273
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,069
Uh, a hug.

274
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,507
Aww.
Oh, sweet.

275
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,772
I know.
What about purple?

276
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,937
Teabagging?

277
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,674
Oh!

278
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,943
Really?

279
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,109
Well, what is teabagging?

280
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,311
Balls in mouth.

281
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,115
Oh, no!

282
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,987
Teabagging?
What is with the kids today?

283
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,822
Well, the blowjob
is the new French kiss.

284
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,965
Wow, we really missed
the boat on that one.

285
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,794
I feel like if we had had
sex bracelets back then,

286
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,526
no one would have
torn mine off.

287
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,932
Ohh. No, no, no, sweetie.

288
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,301
I would have torn off
your BJ bracelet.

289
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,103
You're just saying that,
but thanks, Eric.

290
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,870
Thanks for letting me
blow you.

291
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,310
You're welcome.
You're a good friend.

292
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,121
Hey, Dody.
Mm-hm?

293
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,657
Hi. Can I help you?

294
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,488
Are you Eric?
Yes.

295
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,653
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

296
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,493
I'm Dody Henderson from
the Henderson Realty Group.

297
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,567
And this is my associate
Kelly Tanner.

298
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,170
Hi. How are you?
Hi.

299
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,563
No, thank you.

300
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,833
Lame.

301
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,998
Oh, I shouldn't.
Mm-hm.

302
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,075
We can't wait
to get your house sold.

303
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,510
We need this place
clean, clean every day.

304
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,151
Water the lawns,
skim the pool.

305
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,585
You never know when buyers are gonna
stop by to say hi and buy, buy.

306
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,553
Oh, B-U-Y! Ha, ha!

307
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,750
Whatever.

308
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,863
Oh, and make sure the toilets
are clean enough to eat out of.

309
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,521
Yeah, whatever.

310
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,831
Maybe I should sprinkle some
rose petals on the driveway too.

311
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,561
Just do what you can.

312
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,263
Will do.
Wow.

313
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,740
What are the chances of maybe selling
this sometime after Labor Day?

314
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,036
You wanna sell a summer home
during the summer.

315
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,408
That's kind of the point.

316
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,341
So glad we're in
business together.

317
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,746
Om shanti.

318
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,249
Om.Shanti it is.

319
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,217
Vultures.
Yeesh.

320
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,088
It's light. It's light.

321
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,392
We should put it up closer.
Like there?

322
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,935
McCRUDDEN: Oh, yeah.
That'll bring in all the right clientele.

323
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,311
Listen. Have you given any more thought
to the final Labor Day blowout?

324
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,644
I really don't know.

325
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,218
I mean, obviously,
we gotta do something huge.

326
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,652
But what do you do
for a final blowout?

327
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,416
Go out in a blaze of glory.
Heads held high.

328
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,992
I get it.
Deserved...

329
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,924
Holy shit. Oh, shit.
Here we go. Bingo.

330
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,927
What?
I got the concept right here.

331
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,497
Brown party.

332
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,158
Brown party.
Brown party.

333
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,461
Brown clothes, brown food,
brown drink,

334
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,162
brown clown,
brown balloons,

335
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,671
live music supplied by
Jackson Browne.

336
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,105
I don't know what you're
thinking. Is that good?

337
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,404
It's fucking awful.

338
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,173
Take it easy.
I'm just spitballing.

339
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,441
It's not like you're throwing
ideas my way.

340
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,779
He spells with an E at the end.
Doesn't matter.

341
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,581
Holy shit.
We got a situation here.

342
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,451
Oh, my fucking God.

343
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,854
Dude, she's wearing
a sex bracelet.

344
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,358
McCRUDDEN:
Holy fuck, she is.

345
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,827
Oh, boy, that's trouble.

346
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,296
It's blue. It's blue.
Sword swallower.

347
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,334
When she reaches out for my
cone, I'm gonna snag that thing

348
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,630
and it's deep-throat city
all night long.

349
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,102
No, no, no.

350
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,175
Please don't do that.
Don't. No, stop.

351
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,038
Stop. Stop it.

352
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,705
I bet she unhinges her jaw like a
fucking python swallowing a rat.

353
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,647
Um, do you guys
know what you want?

354
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,879
Yes, we do.
Yeah. We got a pretty good idea.

355
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,647
No, ice cream
is what we're into.

356
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,391
Do you think a girl like that looks at
us like we're a couple of old dudes?

357
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,829
The way we used to look at 30-year-old
guys back in high school and say,

358
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,492
'Oh, man, look at that
lame old guy hitting on Sue. ”

359
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,230
Ha, ha. Yeah, probably.

360
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,136
I don't know. Weren't 30-year-old
guys a lot older back then

361
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,834
with, like, mustaches
and jobs?

362
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,172
It certainly seemed like it.
Yeah.

363
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,571
What?

364
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,876
Fuck, dude, we're getting old.
Bullshit. Come on.

365
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,384
I got a foot cramp
the other day masturbating.

366
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,523
What? Doesn't make sense.
I swear to God. It happened.

367
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,853
Do you think that girl and her
friends really have BJ orgy parties?

368
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,187
Indubitably.
Really?

369
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,352
Duquez is right.
We got fucking hosed.

370
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,465
Goddang.

371
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,365
Hey, what about that?

372
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,525
What about what?

373
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,399
What about that
for the final party?

374
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,733
What?
An orgy.

375
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,375
An orgy?
An orgy.

376
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,033
You wanna have an orgy?
Why not?

377
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,872
Get out of town.
it'll never happen.

378
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,274
Why not?
Why not?

379
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,540
Because people don't
have orgies, you know?

380
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,116
Oh, come on. They used to.

381
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,082
True.
Yeah, think about it, dude.

382
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,121
An orgy.
A good old-fashioned orgy.

383
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,956
Wowie.
That is a blaze of glory.

384
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,095
Okay. Now you know
I hate naysayers, right?

385
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,730
But I'm gonna have to say nay.

386
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,229
Really?
Really.

387
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,957
Are you throwing down
the gauntlet?

388
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,068
Oops, what's that?

389
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,500
It's on the ground
as we speak.

390
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,738
We're gonna have an orgy.

391
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,634
We're gonna have an orgy.

392
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,667
Oh, boy. Here we go.

393
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,238
Okay, guys,
I've been mulling it over

394
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,316
and I have a concept
for the final fiesta.

395
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,248
All right.
What is it?

396
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,752
Whoo!
Fiesta.

397
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,913
While this will be
the most spectacular

398
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,255
and insane party any of us have taken
part of, it's not gonna be a big thing.

399
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,657
It's just gonna be us.

400
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:51,767
It's gonna be small,
intimate, special.

401
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,665
Oh, I'll make lasagna.

402
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,328
Yummy.
Oh, yeah.

403
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,768
We're gonna have an orgy.

404
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,647
Who?
Us.

405
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,611
Where?
Right here. Labor Day weekend.

406
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,687
Us? A naked sex orgy?

407
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,323
You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not. Why not us?

408
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,288
People used to have them
all the time.

409
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,620
All the time.

410
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,285
What happened
to our generation?

411
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,658
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

412
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,528
AIDS.
AIDS.

413
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,294
AIDS hit right
when we hit puberty.

414
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,495
And it scared the shit
out of all of us.

415
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,631
It turned sex into this big,
frightening thing.

416
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,141
He's right.

417
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,974
Kids today are freaks,
our parents were freaks,

418
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,706
we're a bunch of
fucking pussies.

419
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,477
We're the lamest generation.
This is our chance.

420
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,847
Our chance to do it right.

421
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,011
Take back what's
been taken from us.

422
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,522
Isn't that from Goonies?
I am paraphrasing Goonies.

423
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,320
Orgy. Orgy.

424
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,329
Orgy. - Orgy. - Orgy. -

425
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,797
Duquez, come on.
You're into this, right?

426
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,233
What? Heh-heh-heh. No.

427
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,374
We're all friends.
It would just be too weird.

428
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,408
How do you know unless you try?
EW!

429
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,173
If we all went into this with an
open mind, it could be amazing.

430
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,511
In theory,
a noble call to arms.

431
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:20,350
In practice, I cannot
imagine a more awkward

432
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,514
and uncomfortably
terrible evening.

433
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,423
Oh, laugh, laugh,
laugh all you want.

434
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,824
Seriously, don't you get it?
This is it,

435
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,024
the final blowout,
and then the house is gone.

436
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,534
People move away.
Things change.

437
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,105
We need to think
outside of the box.

438
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,209
And inside the box.

439
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,571
Eww.

440
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,770
Mike, that's not
what I'm going for.

441
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,243
Come on. An orgy?

442
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,842
What?
What?

443
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,040
Are you serious?

444
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,277
Yes, it worked. Ha-ha-ha.

445
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,217
Come on. An orgy?

446
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,720
It's madness.

447
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,917
Ugh.
It's gonna be a fucking blast.

448
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,584
Success!
Success!

449
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,889
Sue's in.
Thank you, yes.

450
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,054
Here we go.
Come on.

451
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,894
I'm gonna go meet Marcus.
Oh, my God.

452
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,594
All right, think it over.
Think it- Everybody, okay.

453
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,067
All right, I get it.

454
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,071
It's gonna hike a while to come
around on this whole orgy idea.

455
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,232
Right? Hero?
No, okay. H, h I

456
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,142
Very good, but go ahead, type it in your
BlackBerrys, pencil it in your notebooks.

457
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,613
Orgy. Orgy.

458
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,911
Orgy. Orgy.

459
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,079
Orgy. Orgy. Orgy.

460
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,654
So, Sue, you think this is how you're
gonna finally sleep with Eric?

461
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,768
What? We dated
in high school.

462
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,460
Come on,
that was ages ago.

463
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,400
You guys never,
you know, did it,

464
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,336
so it's kind of
unfinished business.

465
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,841
Yeah, but I've slept with
like a ton of guys since then,

466
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,502
so this doesn't have
anything to do with it.

467
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,444
Fine, but other
than social awkwardness,

468
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,777
give me one reason.

469
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,080
Oh, very well. How about
I give you several reasons?

470
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,779
Like, oh, I don't know,

471
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,618
chlamydia, the herp,

472
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,626
gonorrhea,
syphilis, papilloma.

473
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,127
The Steve McQueen movie?

474
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,960
No, that's Papillon.
The virus that causes genital warts.

475
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,296
Ugh. Why do you think
of this stuff?

476
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,462
Don't you remember the article my
mom clipped from The New Yorker?

477
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,471
No.

478
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,010
Condoms can't stop it
and it causes cervical cancer.

479
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,045
You don't have a cervix.

480
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,346
I don't know how you could have sex
in front of a room full of people.

481
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,648
I mean, I don't even like
to get naked at the spa.

482
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,655
I'm not saying that this is
gonna be easy for me,

483
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,818
but isn't that what
kind of makes it exciting?

484
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,521
I'm not saying that
it wouldn't be fun,

485
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,666
but it's an orgy.

486
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,859
What's the point of
losing all this weight

487
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,970
if you're not gonna show off
your new bod?

488
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,901
You haven't even worn
your bikini yet.

489
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,506
I still have
5 more pounds.

490
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,507
I think this could help
build your self-esteem.

491
00:23:54,666 --> 00:24:00,082
There's the miracle cure. I'm gonna start turning
my clients onto group sex instead of Zoloft.

492
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,479
We're going to the beach.
At least do that.

493
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,678
It's our last summer.
Let's go to the beach.

494
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,347
Shockingly, I'm gonna pass on the
stroll through the tick-infested dunes.

495
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,516
Dude, I've had
Lyme disease.

496
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,185
It's not a big deal.
It's antibiotics, boom, done.

497
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,560
You know I have a needle phobia.
Okay? I can't go to the doctor.

498
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,361
The puncturing
the veins and the... Ugh.

499
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,027
Okay, whatever.
Enjoy the great indoors.

500
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,367
Yeah. Bye.
Okay.

501
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,874
Ooh, hey, Eric. Uh, could you
grab some sand for my ass crack?

502
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,569
I'll grab some
for your cervix.

503
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,047
Okay. Let's say you dated
four guys in one year,

504
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,208
right, and you slept
with them.

505
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,547
You'd be cool with that?
Totally.

506
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,748
And how many guys
have you slept with this year?

507
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,549
None.

508
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,093
Or the year before.

509
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,596
So really all you're doing
is sleeping with four guys

510
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,132
in, like,
a shorter time frame.

511
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,431
I never really thought
of it that way.

512
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,630
What do you think?

513
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,935
Insane, idiotic
and self-destructive.

514
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,074
Okay, hypothetically.
Mm-hm.

515
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:09,083
If I did decide to do it,
but at the last minute,

516
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,380
I totally freaked out,

517
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,490
they would let me out,
right?

518
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,922
Laura, it's an orgy,
not The Accused.

519
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,154
It's not fun
unless everybody's into it.

520
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,158
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

521
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,597
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah? Yeah?

522
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,795
I'm gonna do it.
All right. Yeah, girl.

523
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,133
Hey, guys,
what's the celebration?

524
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,772
Just talking about how to get
Laura back in the saddle.

525
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,505
Whoo, yay!
I'm gonna find you a guy.

526
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,448
Glenn's cousin Frank
is coming to the wedding.

527
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,742
He runs a karate studio in Hoboken.
Pretty cool.

528
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,445
McCRUDDEN:
Okay, Game on. Let's go.

529
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,784
All right, John Kruk.

530
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:52,394
I'll tell you what I'm gonna throw,
and you're still gonna whiff at it.

531
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,291
Slow breaking curveball.

532
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,323
Oh!

533
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,491
Goddamn it! I dare you
to throw that again.

534
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,639
Sweet Wiffle,
the nerd's revenge.

535
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,705
Ooh, I got my
bunt face on.

536
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,172
Drills, ladies. Drills.
Let's go. Look alive.

537
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,675
Album cover,
hat or no hat?

538
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,813
Oh, Doug,
come on, man.

539
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,846
You've been doing this
for two years.

540
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,484
Mixing, remixing.
Hatting, no hatting.

541
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,779
Your music's awesome.
Get it out there.

542
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,720
No one will give it a shot if they don't dig my look.
It's an image-based industry.

543
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,326
What the fuck(? This is why
you're headed for a shitty job.

544
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,987
You need to stop trying to look like a
rock star and start living like one.

545
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,565
Yeah, do the orgy.
Do the orgy.

546
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,201
You think Mick Jagger
would have said,

547
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,394
'No thanks, mate.
No orgy for me.

548
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,232
I've got an on-again-off-again
girlfriend. ”

549
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,533
'I don't
wanna cheat on David Bowie. ”

550
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,836
'No cheating on Bowie. ”
Hey, Willow.

551
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,906
I know what Tom Hanks
feels like now.

552
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,015
My only concern, Duque,

553
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,515
is that the hat doesn't
make you look gay enough.

554
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,845
Oh, yeah.

555
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,579
You could Photoshop in three
guys jizzing on your face?

556
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,190
Or on the hat?
Ooh, ooh.

557
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,553
That's good.
Hey.

558
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:01,186
You could take that five-song demo, make it a double album.
One with the hat, one without it?

559
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,424
You could call it, uh,
Exile on Hat Street.

560
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:07,035
Yeah, or Jagged Little Hat?
Oh, Meat Loaf. Hat Outta Hell.

561
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,105
What about Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hats Club Hat?

562
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,902
What if I just call it My
Shitty Friends Don? Respect Me?

563
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,039
Indie. You won't be able
to sell at Walmart.

564
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,240
Who's next up to hat?
Two and two to Harvey Key.

565
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,045
Sandy winds up and delivers.

566
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,079
Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo!
Fuck me.

567
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,723
Hey, Ali Cat.
Hi.

568
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,085
Like what you see?

569
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,284
This could be all yours
Labor Day weekend.

570
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,224
Oh, Eric.

571
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,126
Do you mind if
I make an observation?

572
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,267
Oh, boy. Sure, go ahead.

573
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,369
You have intimacy issues.

574
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,731
Really? Yeah.

575
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,237
I figured an orgy is
as intimate as it can get.

576
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,240
No, no, no, but intimacy
isn't about intercourse, Eric.

577
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,707
It's about emotion.
Mm-hm.

578
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,643
You don't need to get laid.
You need to be in a relationship.

579
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,751
Heh, heh. Look, just because
you're in an unhappy relationship,

580
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,417
doesn't mean
the rest of us need to be.

581
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,419
I'm not in an unhappy
relationship.

582
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,457
I'm in an adult relationship.

583
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,595
It's fun, whatever it is.
Hold on one sec?

584
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,788
Hey, Marcus. You want
to hike a few cracks with the bat?

585
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,261
No, thank you.

586
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,426
Football is my game,
European football.

587
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,899
Gotcha.

588
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,301
Did he date Siegfried or Roy?
I can't remember.

589
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,772
Oh!

590
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,673
God, it's embarrassing
watching you play this sport.

591
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,610
Aww, it's cow shit.

592
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,614
Look, doc, it's your life.

593
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,150
You can do
whatever you want.

594
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,618
All I'm saying is that maybe
Labor Day weekend

595
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,053
might be the last chopper
out of Saigon for you.

596
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,697
Knock, knock.
Guess who.

597
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,666
Dody! Ha-ha-ha.

598
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,136
These are the Webers.
How you doing?

599
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,505
We brought some extra signs

600
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,337
because someone
is stealing ours.

601
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,172
Oh. That's too bad.

602
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,674
Oh, good. Okay.
Hey, guys. Do me a favor?

603
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,978
When you go in the house, don't
go to the basement or anything.

604
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:07,317
Not that there's anything or anyone
down there in a cage or otherwise.

605
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,483
Thanks, Eric.
That's so helpful.

606
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,820
What is he talking about?

607
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,862
Oh, gosh. Don't worry. Don't worry.

608
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,330
He's a little off.

609
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,730
It's a head injury.

610
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,996
That's why he wears
the helmet.

611
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,663
Are they all challenged?

612
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,810
Yes. But at least
they have each other.

613
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,175
Oh, that's so great.

614
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,873
Have fun with your game,
sweetie.

615
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,517
Thanks, Mrs. Weber.

616
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,051
We are five minutes
from Indian Wells Beach.

617
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,418
And wait till you see
your bedroom.

618
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,221
What if someone comes in?
These people never knock.

619
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,800
I just locked the door.

620
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,803
Fine, but you really
must be quiet.

621
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,304
None of your usual screeches.

622
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,066
Okay, okay, okay.
Yes?

623
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,268
Yeah.

624
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,239
Oh, Marcus. Oh...

625
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,908
Let's get you out
of these dirty little panties.

626
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,054
Do it. What?

627
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,589
What's going on? Why are you stopping?
What's going on? Hey.

628
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,248
What?

629
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,451
What have you done
to your vagina?

630
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,257
I shaved it.

631
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,138
Why?
I don't know.

632
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:08,801
Because I thought it would be
something different, sexy.

633
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,574
Women are supposed to have pubic hair.
Why would I find it sexy?

634
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,808
You look like
a prepubescent girl.

635
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,350
I'm not a child molester.

636
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,613
Okay, you know what, it's hair,
Marcus, and it's gonna grow back.

637
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,186
Well, I wished you
would have told me

638
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,851
about your little secret
before I unwrapped this.

639
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,463
This lambskin condoms
cost 2 Euros.

640
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,293
It's wasteful.

641
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,494
I did it for you!

642
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,603
You could have
consulted with me.

643
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,138
I don't make you wear
deodorant because you don't want to!

644
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,277
Alison, you're being
like a child.

645
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,878
Fuck you, go away!

646
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,981
You go away.

647
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,480
I think this is chemical.

648
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,482
Darling, what dosage
are you hiking?

649
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,814
You- Fuck you!

650
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,319
This is your problem.

651
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,891
I was just expressing my
sexuality in a healthy manner.

652
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,996
God forbid, Marcus,
that we experiment a little bit.

653
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,392
Fine.

654
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,501
I'm going back to the city
and I'm taking the iPod.

655
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,899
Fine. Leave!

656
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,370
And your breath is terrible!

657
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,533
My breath is natural.
Unlike your vagina.

658
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,036
Fuck you!

659
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,586
Oh. Jesus.

660
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,512
Sorry.

661
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,886
Ahem. It's all right.

662
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,097
The worst part is
I'm just peeing right now.

663
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,010
I've been kicking
around a few ideas.

664
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,049
Party themes.
Let me know what you think.

665
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,518
First one, Roman, right?
You're talking togas, wine,

666
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,884
bushels of grapes,
the whole deal.

667
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,923
Then I also have '70s, right?

668
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,552
We got the swinger vibe,
polyester, big hair,

669
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,563
upstairs and down, you know?
Um, I don't know.

670
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,134
What about the Kama Sutra?

671
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,735
That's actually not bad.
Yeah?

672
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,600
Ye h, ye h, like the sex secrets
of the E st, right?

673
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,742
Mm-hm.
Oh, that's- Yeah.

674
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,709
You know you have like,
uh, incense, tapestries.

675
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,371
Veils, diaphanous fabrics.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,279
I have no idea what the hell
that is, but I like it.

677
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,613
You and me, we're on the
same page with this.

678
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,120
Right? I think so.
Absolutely.

679
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,451
How do you spell 'Kama'?
Yeah.

680
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,093
Dude, babe alert
at 3 o'clock.

681
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,092
Three o'clock.
My 3, my 3.

682
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,428
Wait.
That hurts my dink.

683
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,934
Wait a minute.
That's Kelly.

684
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,572
Who?
My Realtor.

685
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,298
Oh, shit, the enemy.

686
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,671
Listen to me. Listen.

687
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,779
We cannot afford to lose the casa
de sex before Labor Day, okay?

688
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,848
You go over there, you get in
tight with her, lay on the charm,

689
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,951
and get her to drag ass
selling the house.

690
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,450
No, no, that is-
Yes, yes.

691
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,919
She is a tough cookie.
She'll see through that.

692
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,024
Her? Please, dude,
you're the king.

693
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,491
A little winey-diney, she'll
be your humble wench servant.

694
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,453
Keep friends close,
but enemies closer.

695
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,897
Yeah. That doesn't make any sense.
Just go fucking charm her, okay?

696
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,634
Okay.
Go, go, go.

697
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,032
All right.
Do the thing.

698
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,470
What?
The smile thing. Ahem.

699
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,638
Kelly. Kelly. Hi.
Oh, Eric.

700
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,178
Hey.
Hey.

701
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,042
Oh, my God, look at this.
Watch.

702
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,276
I hope anything I said didn't screw
anything up with the client.

703
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,546
I was joking around.
I didn't freak them out?

704
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,382
Oh, no. Not at all.
Oh, good.

705
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,287
You were wearing that helmet
so I was able to convince them

706
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,327
that, you know,
you ride the short bus.

707
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,157
Well, that's good.

708
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,696
Yeah. Thanks.
Well played.

709
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,198
Hey, do you mind if-?
Maybe I can make up to you.

710
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,165
Take you out to dinner
or something?

711
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,202
Could be fun, yeah?
Oh, gosh, thanks.

712
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,502
Um, technically, I'm not supposed
to go out with clients so...

713
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,578
Well, technically
my dad's the client.

714
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,578
Right now I'm just some
random dude on the beach.

715
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,240
She's smiling. Look, she's smiling.
She's buying it.

716
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,750
Okay. I'll go to dinner
with you.

717
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,013
All right.

718
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,350
But, tell me which party
we met at.

719
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,686
Was it one of my parties?
Mm-hm.

720
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,487
Okay. What, um...

721
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,028
Oh, was it the
Cuba Libre party because

722
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,393
I was in mojito haze
that whole day and I just-

723
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,932
Nope.
No.

724
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,433
Oktoberfest in July?

725
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,538
Nope.
Oh, oh, no, no, I know.

726
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,764
I know.

727
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,205
Uh, it was the Star Trek versus Star
Wars Battle for the Universe Party

728
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,209
and you were dressed
as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

729
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,712
How drunk do you get
at these parties?

730
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,715
Uh, pretty drunk.
It's kind of a social obligation.

731
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,445
Okay. I'm gonna
give you a hint.

732
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,214
I wear a size 9 shoe.

733
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,687
Oh, my God.

734
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,885
Oh, my God,
you're bean dip girl.

735
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,030
You're bean dip girl?
I am.

736
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,291
Have you been bean dip
girl the whole time?

737
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,627
Oh, he's so good.

738
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,895
I can't believe that.
I was gonna call you.

739
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,402
I had your number
on my hand

740
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,438
and I jumped in the pool
and it was gone.

741
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,099
I thought I lost you.
I thought you were gone forever.

742
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,472
And you-

743
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,807
You look so much better
without the fake baby.

744
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,573
I actually prefer the mullet.

745
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,081
Oh, I just cut it yesterday.

746
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,445
Oh.
For work.

747
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,611
Don't think this whole funny,
charming thing right now

748
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,586
gets you off
for stealing my signs.

749
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,885
I don't know
what you're talking about.

750
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,959
I'm furious
those signs are gone.

751
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,596
You're lying.
I'm not lying.

752
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,425
Your voice just went up.
What?

753
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,429
I.. I'm..

754
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,933
I'm not lying. I am not lying.

755
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,502
You're so lying.
No, I'm not.

756
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,571
Fucking James Bond. Fuck.

757
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,968
Wow, look at that, huh?

758
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,273
Holy smokes.
Another gorgeous shot.

759
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,608
Yeah, thanks.

760
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,779
What should I use,
pitching wedge or nine?

761
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,047
I used the nine.

762
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,687
I think maybe
I should use the wedge.

763
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,291
Or use the wedge.

764
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,588
Ugh! Why am I like this?

765
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,962
Oh, just pick a club and hit it.
What is the big deal?

766
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,832
Will you do the orgy with me?

767
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,863
Hey, can we
play through?

768
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,133
Hold on a second, man.

769
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,840
The orgy.

770
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,141
You think that would be
a good idea?

771
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,008
I'm stuck.
And I think the reason

772
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,485
is because
I feel like a fucking fraud.

773
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,057
I'm not cool.
I have a law degree.

774
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,661
I ride a motorcycle and it scares
the fucking shit out of me.

775
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,230
And I play golf at my mom's
fucking country club

776
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,558
with assholes like this.

777
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,397
What's the holdup?
Play the wedge!

778
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,031
This is not rock 'n' roll.

779
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,842
This could be
really good for me.

780
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,001
For me and for us.

781
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,875
Will you do the orgy with me?

782
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,845
Sure, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Yeah.

783
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,184
Really?

784
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,422
Holy shit.
Yeah.

785
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,187
If you're sure
this is what you want.

786
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,026
Yeah, absolutely.

787
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,361
Good.
I think.

788
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,659
Fore!

789
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,713
So you wanna know why
guys don't get as excited

790
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,373
about their wedding
as women do?

791
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:32,043
See, it used to be like a guy would get
rewarded for his commitment with sex.

792
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,883
But you and Glenn have
had sex like a billion times.

793
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,390
For God's sake, you guys
have a kid together.

794
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:43,089
So for Glenn, it's just kind of
like all commitment, no reward.

795
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,733
You know?

796
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,927
I'm the fucking reward.

797
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,730
Of course you are.
Of course.

798
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,430
No.
Hello?

799
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,268
Something's wrong.
He's never late.

800
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,469
Try him again.
I have been trying him.

801
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,078
He's not answering
his phone.

802
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,806
At least he won't wear a white
tuxedo like you dickheads.

803
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,609
Oh, God,
that's good.

804
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,588
Oh, sweet Lord in heaven.

805
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,384
What the fuck,
are you stoned?

806
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,755
No. No, no, no, better.

807
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,557
I'm wearing a thing called
The Yank. From Adam & Eve.

808
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,599
One end straps around your leg,
the other end around your wang.

809
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,727
The brochure says, 'With every stride,
it gives your member a gentle tug. ”

810
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:23,928
Ahh.

811
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,939
What are you doing with a rope
on your cock at my wedding?

812
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,009
Endurance training,
Labor Day.

813
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,113
Mm-mm.
For what? A jack-off marathon?

814
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,010
What? Uh, yeah.

815
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,846
That's exactly it.
You nailed it. Heh, heh.

816
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,681
Hey, check it out.
Look who's here.

817
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,654
Oh, fantastic.
Another asshole in white hails.

818
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,123
Keep the change, man.

819
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,957
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, my God.

820
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,799
Well, well, well.
Look at you.

821
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:54,493
You're late, you're in costume,
and you appear to be hammered.

822
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,830
Who the hell
are you?

823
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,132
Long story. I got fired.

824
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,467
What?
What?

825
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,134
It had more to do with the fact that I
almost blew a $2 billion merger deal

826
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,304
because some bozo jumped into
the pool with my BlackBerry.

827
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,343
Oh, shit. Dude.

828
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,645
I spent most of last night
crying and drinking

829
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,654
and then I drunk-dialed my mom.
She kind of talked me down.

830
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,485
Then I woke up this morning,

831
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,821
had a little more to drink
and I realized, you know what?

832
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,021
This is good. I'm free.

833
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,494
Adam, I'm so sorry.

834
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,565
Shh, shh, shush.
You're my friend.

835
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,667
No, they took my twenties
from me.

836
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,863
And I plan to make my thirties
making up for it.

837
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,666
And you know what else?

838
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,401
I'm doing the orgy. Fuck it.

839
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,001
Orgy?

840
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,738
What orgy?

841
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,541
The fuck are you
talking about?

842
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,412
See, this is exactly why we
should have told him, Eric.

843
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,882
Told me what?

844
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,181
That's what we're doing
for Labor Day. An orgy.

845
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,915
Bullshit. Who's having an orgy?

846
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,390
It's me, Willow,
these two fellas,

847
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,894
Laura, Sue, now drunkie.

848
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,190
Waiting on Alison.

849
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,333
Jesus H.
Fucking Christ.

850
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,402
How come you cocksuckers didn't
think of this fucking orgy idea

851
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,869
five fucking years ago?
Goddamn it!

852
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,065
Ahem. Uh, Glenn.

853
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,904
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to start without your friend.

854
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,306
Oh, he's here.
He's, uh...

855
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,409
Hi, Rabbi.
No.

856
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,414
Pardon my French.

857
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,848
All right, everybody.

858
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,513
Introducing
for the very first time,

859
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,092
Mr. and Mrs. Glenn Pasillio.

860
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,622
Paciello.
Paciellio.

861
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,198
Here we go.

862
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,396
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

863
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,235
I am married.

864
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,901
Thank you.

865
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,580
I can't believe you guys
broke up because you shaved.

866
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,650
He's the weirdest,
creepiest guy ever.

867
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,479
Here you are, ladies.

868
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,089
You guys are definitely
broken up this time, right?

869
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,792
Fuck relationships.

870
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,762
Right now, all I wanna
do is have some fun.

871
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:09,094
♪ No, I'm not afraid of love ♪

872
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,268
♪ Just because I run away ♪

873
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,137

874
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,617

876
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,757
Labor Day.

877
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,618
I'm in.

878
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,627
Yes. Yes.

879
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,459
Oh, and I'm fully shaved.

880
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,133
Alison.
Oh, no, no, no.

881
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,294
I'm not making a speech.

882
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,634
Sorry about that.
it's, uh, private conversation.

883
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,670
Are you okay?

884
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,303
You know what they're doing over Labor Day?
Do you know what the party is?

885
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,540
What?

886
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,151
They're having a fucking orgy.

887
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,515
Heh-heh-heh.
What are you talking about?

888
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,214
They are having an orgy.

889
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,185
Like a sex orgy?

890
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,487
Like a sex orgy
and we're not invited.

891
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,698
Hey. Hi.

892
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,232
So is it true?

893
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,631
That all of you
are having this orgy

894
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,670
and you didn't think
to invite us?

895
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,709
What are you all
looking at me for? I-

896
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,403
Guys, you just got married,
okay?

897
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,549
L- You have a kid.
You don't-

898
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,015
Don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

899
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,847
Well, of course
we wouldn't come.

900
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,853
It's that you didn't ask us.
You didn't even think of us.

901
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,424
In fact, you specifically
hid this from us.

902
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,561
We invited all you
to be here today,

903
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,061
just the most special
day of our lives,

904
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,099
and you, who are supposed
to be our closest friends...

905
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:49,362
There were family members who didn't
get invited so you could come.

906
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,698
Family members.
Right.

907
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:55,271
Now, we're just totally out of your
pervy little social club. Huh?

908
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,538
I don't believe this.

909
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,214
Sorry.
Are you happy?

910
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:11,224
Because you and your stupid orgy
just ruined our goddamn wedding.

911
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,419
Oh, come on, Glenn.
Kate!

912
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,220
Is it too late to invite them?
I'll go talk to her.

913
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,422
No!

914
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,534
Are you kidding me?
Guys, it's Katie.

915
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,294
She's gonna be fine
in like an hour.

916
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,233
I just realized
I'm really hammered

917
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,465
and I would really
like to dance.

918
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,972
I'm dancing too.

919
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,941
This reminds me
of our senior prom.

920
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,102
You still won't give me
a hand job, right?

921
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,912
♪ it's the boom boom ♪

922
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,921
♪ it's the boom boom ♪

923
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,655
♪ Oh, baby ♪♪

924
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,090
McCRUDDEN:
Oh, God.

925
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,731
It's amazing that you're still
so tight with your high school friends.

926
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,771
None of mine moved
back after college.

927
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,773
Yeah, it's a, uh... I don't know,
it's maybe corny to say,

928
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,809
but these guys and gals
are kind of like

929
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,470
the closest thing I've got
to a family these days.

930
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,777
That's why the house, the summer
house, it's like our rec center.

931
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,618
I think we're getting an offer
on the rec center.

932
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,251
My dad will be thrilled.

933
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,789
I knew it.
What?

934
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,359
I knew it wasn't a family
decision to sell the house.

935
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,827
No. We're not big into
family decisions anymore.

936
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,262
My mom,
she lives in Portland, Oregon,

937
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,528
with this, uh,
Reiki healer asshole.

938
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,332
Tell me exactly how you feel.
Oh, he's good. He's good.

939
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,101
Uh, no, she's kind of
out of the picture.

940
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,835
Her doing. Um, yeah,
it's just me and my dad.

941
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,606
Hm, well, your dad
seems like a fun guy.

942
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,805
Oh!
Yeah?

943
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,008
Yeah, yeah, he's very fun.
He's a hoot.

944
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,983
Kind of like being raised
by an older fraternity brother.

945
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,680
He hit on me a little bit.
No.

946
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,985
He ask you to play golf?
Yes.

947
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,492
That's his move.
He's very good at golf. Very good.

948
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,824
But he did it right in front
of Cherie and she had no idea.

949
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,523
Neither did my mom
for a while.

950
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,835
Now if you will excuse me,
Oh.

951
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,902
I have to win this game
if you don't mind.

952
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,801
Does this make you...?
It's a little distracting.

953
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,909
That's not distracting at all. Oh!
Jesus.

954
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,408
I lied.
It was a little distracting.

955
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,768
We to hero to observe.
Th t is II.

956
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,812
You got rubbers on you?

957
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,885
McCRUDDEN: Yeah. What do you think
this is, an underground sex club?

958
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,185
Do you have any
idea where you're going?

959
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,386
McCRUDDEN: He said come in
through the warehouse entrance.

960
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,723
You got rubbers on you?

961
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:29,921
No.
What?

962
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,066
We to hero to observe.
Th t is II.

963
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,327
It's a sex club.
Semper H. Always prepared.

964
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,267
You know what I mean?
Doesn't that mean 'always faithful'?

965
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,532
Hey, who took Latin
in seventh grade?

966
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,939
Moi, okay? I brought a pack
with me if you need one.

967
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,942
Give me the signal.
I won't need one.

968
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:51,844
What do you want?

969
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,182
The password is chandelier.

970
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:57,882
Who's your connection?

971
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:01,120
Vic George, friend of my uncle's.
Yeah. He told me to expect you.

972
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,389
Come on in.

973
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,768
So welcome to the Paradiso.

974
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,066
What the fuck(?

975
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,044
Can I hike your clothes?
No.

976
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,441
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

977
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,740
Okay, follow me.
Yeah.

978
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,076
This is Bill.
Hey, Bill.

979
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,946
That was a panda.

980
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,211
Go easy on that thing.

981
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,412
Didi, Ginger.

982
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,248
Clambake.

983
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,654
Good look at that. That's pretty cool.
Yeah.

984
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,819
This group right here.
They're crazy, crazy, crazy.

985
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,464
Heh, heh.
Okay.

986
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,396
If you guys get a shot, get in the swing.
You will love it.

987
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,297
My grandma has that thing.

988
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,062
Another time,
probably.

989
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,968
You need anything,
just ask for Fred.

990
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,165
Oh, Fred's Beds?
That's a different Fred.

991
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,401
I'm a dentist.

992
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,671
Vic, he is over there in the
futon section. All right?

993
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,007
Okay.
Have a good time.

994
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,238
Thanks, Dr. Fred.

995
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,508
You guys be good.

996
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,448
Whoa. Should've had
this guy at the wedding.

997
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,118

Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.

1002
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,667
McCRUDDEN:
Vic?

1003
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,102
Hey, Mikey.
Hey.

1004
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,707
Little McCrudden.

1005
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,639
Holy shit, you've grown.
Yeah.

1006
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,472
How you doing, baby?
Good, good.

1007
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,475
How's your folks?
Good, they're on a cruise.

1008
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,515
Mom got her pound cake
recipe published.

1009
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,051
This is my buddy Eric.
Eric, Vic.

1010
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,983
Your mom's a good woman.

1011
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,119
Oh, how you doing, man?

1012
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,058
Yeah. Good to meet you.

1013
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,284
This is Ellen.

1014
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,485
Ellen.
Hi, guys.

1015
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,063
Hi.
Eric and Mikey.

1016
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,857
It's Mike. I go by Mike now.

1017
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,695
First time at
the Paradiso, eh, guys?

1018
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:47,961
Mm-hm.
Ooh, ooh.

1019
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,071
Got a couple of cherries
to pop.

1020
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,831
Come on, guys, hike off
the clothes and get fucking.

1021
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,409
No. No fucking. No. Actually, no, no.
We're here more doing research

1022
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,705
than anything else.
We're gonna throw an orgy.

1023
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,213
We were hoping we can
get a little advice.

1024
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,011
I see. Let's powwow
over at the snack nook.

1025
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,778
Snack nook is good.
Snack nook.

1026
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,352
Just let me finish up here.

1027
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,047
No rush.
Rush if you want.

1028
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,885
Rush a little.
Oh.

1029
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,086
Come on, cowboy.
Time to shine.

1030
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,692
Yeah. Almost.
Let's keep going, just a second.

1031
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,424
I'll be right there,
just a second.

1032
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,829
There we go.

1033
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,432
Look at me, not her.

1034
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,602
Look at me, not her. Look at me.
I'm not gonna look at him.

1035
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,438
Oh.
Oh. Ah.

1036
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,946
Did your brother finish college?
I know he switched a couple schools.

1037
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,880
Yeah. Oof. Oh.
Yeah.

1038
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,350
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1039
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,819
Do me a favor,
count me down.

1040
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,049
Five, four, three-

1041
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,559
Go back to 10!
Ten, nine, eight-

1042
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:51,131
Oh! Your mom's
a good woman.

1043
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,262
A little early on that one.

1044
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,933
He just said your mom's
a good woman when he ejaculated,

1045
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,132
just so you know.

1046
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,376
Holy shit,
I got a second one.

1047
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,243
Holy shit.

1048
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:21,154
So you kids are gonna
have an orgy? Hm?

1049
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,603
So, Vic, as someone that's
clearly done this type of thing

1050
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,298
thousands of times, I'm guessing,
we could really use your expertise.

1051
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,171
How do we make sure
that the women are into it?

1052
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,936
The women?
Yeah.

1053
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,672
Don't worry about the women,
worry about you guys.

1054
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,317
Us? What?

1055
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,919
Women are in touch
with their sexuality.

1056
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:50,388
Guys are much more likely to freak out
at the sight of someone else's junk.

1057
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,389
Taquito?

1058
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:57,863
Uh... No, thanks.
I ate just before I came.

1059
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,798
You see? This is what I'm talking about.
You're scared shitless.

1060
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,029
You won't even touch
the taquito.

1061
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:07,698
It's like it's a cock and you're
afraid to put it in your mouth.

1062
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,107
I swear to God, I had a bacon
cheeseburger like 45 minutes ago.

1063
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,112
Hi.
McCRUDDEN: Hi.

1064
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,718
Okay, so how
do we make it happen?

1065
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,388
You can't make an orgy happen.

1066
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,387
It has to evolve organically.

1067
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,026
Just because you have a bunch
of naked people in the room

1068
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,025
doesn't mean
you're all going to get it on.

1069
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,790
You might just need a really
intense conversation.

1070
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,559
Sometimes a girl just
wants to have a heart-to-heart,

1071
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,429
and she ends up
pulling a train.

1072
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,135
Uh, pulling a train?
Mm.

1073
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:38,796
Yeah, you know.
A train.

1074
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:42,876
Gawk, gawk, gawk.
Chicka-chicka-chicka. Whoo-whoo!

1075
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,536
Ha-ha-ha.
That's a choo-choo train. Thank you.

1076
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,648
Hey. Ellen, hello.

1077
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,848
Vic.
Two-minute warning.

1078
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,585
I'm ready whenever you are.

1079
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,656
She always is.
Ah.

1080
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,091
Wow. Yes.
One more thing.

1081
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,853
Every wolf pack has a leader.
I take it you're the lead wolf?

1082
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:03,395
Fucking A.
Uh, yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Yeah.

1083
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,090
Well, then it's
all on your shoulders.

1084
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,760
If you don't run,
nobody behind you can run.

1085
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,702
Oh, that's good.
What does that mean? What do I do?

1086
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,173
You have to get naked.

1087
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,507
Okay.

1088
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,113
Uh- I get that.
Mm-hm.

1089
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,580
Not just your body.

1090
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:28,185
You've gotta get naked in your mind,
in your heart, in your soul.

1091
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,848
You've gotta be honest
with yourself and everybody

1092
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:35,019
about what you want. If you're
a pegger, be honest about that.

1093
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,687
Okay.
If you're polyamorous,

1094
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,888
put it out there.

1095
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,227
You want to put on
a diaper, embrace it.

1096
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,428
But trust me, if you put up walls,
everybody's gonna put up walls.

1097
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,368
The whole thing is
dead in the water.

1098
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,133
What is a pegger?

1099
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,299
Chick fucks a dude up the ass
with a strap-on.

1100
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,645
Yeah, not really my bag,
but like I always say,

1101
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,407
I'm willing to try
anything twice.

1102
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,611
I always say it.

1103
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,220
Ha-ha-ha!

1104
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,447
Hey, guys. Hey!

1105
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,289
Hello, senator. Hello.

1106
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,319
This is a lot to process.

1107
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:09,890
You listen to me.

1108
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:14,167
You can't force it
and you can't fake it.

1109
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,497
So you better cut the bullshit,

1110
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,107
nut up, and be a man.

1111
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,400
Now if you'll excuse me,

1112
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,774
I feel the blood
rushing back to my sword.

1113
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,745
I noticed that.

1114
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,483
Well, hey, Vic, thank you.
This is all good stuff.

1115
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,484
Good advice.
Yeah. Good. Thank you.

1116
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,678
My pleasure, guys.

1117
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,051
Okay, watch that thing.
This is unnecessary.

1118
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,189
Watch that thing.

1119
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,152
Good luck.

1120
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,528
Oh, one more thing.

1121
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,691
Buy some scented candles.
It helps hide the smell of ass.

1122
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,767
Okay. Good, good, good.

1123
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,927
Smart.
Smart, smart, smart.

1124
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,300
Don't eat anything here.

1125
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,169
You son of a bitch.
Don't.

1126
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,774
Uh-oh.

1127
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,212
Holy shit, is that-?
Oh, boy.

1128
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,785
Keep going.
Don't let her see you.

1129
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,123
Oh!
Hey, what the fuck(?

1130
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,828
Oh. Man, oh, man. All right.
That was good?

1131
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,295
That was good.
Yeah.

1132
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,559
Yeah, okay, here we go.

1133
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,634
You ready?
Showtime.

1134
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,130
Sh- Shit.

1135
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,569
I'm gonna count that.
Okay.

1136
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,403
I'm gonna count that there.
Okay.

1137
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,306
Yeah, it's juvenile.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1138
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,971
What?
What's Dody like as a boss?

1139
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,744
She just seems like she could be
a little, you know, domineering.

1140
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,684
Oh, my gosh, no. I mean, she's
not what you think, you know.

1141
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,155
I mean, of course,
at work she's all business,

1142
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,590
but, Eric, she has
traveled the world.

1143
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,026
No shit.
She speaks all these languages.

1144
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,665
Wow.
She's just full of surprises.

1145
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,357
Oh, I bet she is.

1146
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,662
I bet she's been places
I can only imagine.

1147
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,836
So, like, now that
you're super into me...

1148
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:03,239
No, there's something
I actually have to tell you.

1149
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,879
Sincerely I, um...
Really?

1150
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,015
Yeah, I kind of misled you.
Uh...

1151
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:12,051
What you saw today was not an actual
representation of my Frisbee golf skills.

1152
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,347
Yeah. I let you win.

1153
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,184
Really?
Yeah...

1154
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,348
So I want a rematch.
Like, bigtime.

1155
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,695
Or you could just stick
to sucking at pool.

1156
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,854
Ooh.

1157
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,193
SSS!
Oh.

1158
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,634
One more.

1159
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,036
That's it, though.
No.

1160
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,268
That was the last one.
That's for the road.

1161
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:37,537
I will call you.

1162
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,812
Okay.
All right.

1163
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,040
See you.
Hey, um...

1164
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,550
What are you doing
for Labor Day?

1165
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,988
Oh, yeah. Is that-?
Yeah, Labor Day.

1166
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,954
Um, you know what?

1167
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,822
The guys and the crew,
we're all gonna, um...

1168
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,894
We're doing
this small little thing,

1169
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,555
this intimate little thing.
Nothing- Nothing special.

1170
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,225
Well, I was thinking
that maybe, you know,

1171
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,065
your friends and my friends
could get together.

1172
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,467
Yeah.

1173
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,073
Oh, that sounds great.
Yeah?

1174
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,141
We should definitely
look into that maybe.

1175
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,744
Yeah. It'd be fun.

1176
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,642
So, wait, Eric, is that-?
Is that a maybe?

1177
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,909
Yeah, it's a maybe. It's a definite maybe.
It's a hard, hard maybe.

1178
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,144
We should definitely
think about doing that.

1179
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,585
Let's lock it in as a possibility.

1180
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,951
Okay.
Okay.

1181
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,354
I'll call you about it.

1182
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:26,653
Or write you.

1183
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,625
Heh, okay.

1184
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,095
Carrier pigeon. Something.
I'll get a hold of you.

1185
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,961
Good night, Eric.
Good night, Kelly.

1186
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:51,816
Hey.
Hi.

1187
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,182
What are you doing up?
Oh, I never went down.

1188
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,814
Stayed up drinking with a dude from Blues
Traveler in the Talkhouse parking lot.

1189
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:02,191
Like an hour ago, fucking dude
says the bubonic plague is back.

1190
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,628
Great. Another thing
to worry about.

1191
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,793
What are you doing up?

1192
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,661
I got a bit
of a situation.

1193
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,636
Hit me.

1194
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:16,471
Okay, but first off,
you can't tell anyone.

1195
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,408
Dude, look who you're talking to.

1196
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,343
It's the vault.
Seriously.

1197
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:22,881
A lot of people tell people
you can't tell someone,

1198
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,986
and those people go and tell someone.
That cannot happen.

1199
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,486
Hey. You tell no one.

1200
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,318
Not even Rodrigo?

1201
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,825
Why would you tell a 50-year-old
Guatemalan landscaper about my life?

1202
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,520
Because he's a good
sounding board, okay?

1203
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,860
But if you're gonna get all weird
about it, I won't tell Rodrigo.

1204
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,025
I appreciate it.

1205
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,903
I went on a date last night.

1206
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,335
So far, so good.

1207
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,531
With the Realtor chick.

1208
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,033
Dody Henderson?
Did she peg you?

1209
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,010
No, not Dody.
I went out with Kelly.

1210
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,341
Oh, thank the Lord.

1211
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,506
I felt bad for your
butt hole for a minute.

1212
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:57,708
Heh, heh.
Yeah.

1213
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:02,084
Yeah, and I think
we've got a problem because

1214
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,685
I really kind of dig her now.

1215
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,693
I don't know what to do
about the orgy situation.

1216
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,229
Are you fucking with me?

1217
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,525
I know.
What are the odds?

1218
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,430
I mean, seriously,
I'm smack dab

1219
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,264
in the middle
of organizing an orgy.

1220
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,769
Orgy, yeah.
Yes. Yeah.

1221
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,373
And I meet the first girl
in a long time

1222
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,067
that I can see myself
having a relationship with.

1223
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,937
Hmm.
I gotta tell her about the orgy.

1224
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,048
What? Ha-ha-ha!

1225
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,548
No. No. It's so stupid.

1226
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,948
No. Listen to me. No, no.

1227
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,613
You don't ever, ever, ever
tell her about our little soiree here.

1228
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,224
Ever.

1229
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,883
Have you porked her yet?

1230
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,393
Oh, goddamn it, Mike.
I hate when you say stuff.

1231
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,589
No. No, we've kissed.

1232
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,461
Kissed, good. Okay, good.

1233
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,069
Keep it PG until
after Labor Day, okay?

1234
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:52,604
As long as you haven't had the exclusivity
talk, and you're not honing...

1235
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,571
Yeah, I know.
Then you, my friend,

1236
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:55,903
are a free agent.

1237
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,011
Mm, I don't know, dude.

1238
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:02,240
Listen to me.
You do not know what or who

1239
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,282
she's been doing
in her free time, ace.

1240
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,649
So just keep it in your pants
until après Labor Day

1241
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,448
and then
it'll just be this crazy,

1242
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,752
wet, vivid, erotic

1243
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:16,261
sexual misadventure
in your past

1244
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:19,263
that you never have to
tell her about.

1245
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:24,628
Okay.

1246
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,774
Okay?
All right, that's the plan.

1247
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,002
Thank you.
That was oddly helpful.

1248
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,113
I am not just a pretty face.

1249
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,847
Oof, m goof.

1250
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,042
Daddy really needs
to get in shape.

1251
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,278
Oh, I'm with you.
I may even cut out carbs,

1252
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,855
except for pizza
and sandwiches, obviously.

1253
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:47,460
Are you guys worried at all about
performing in front of everyone else?

1254
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,153
Look, it's not a race.

1255
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,357
Well, assuming
that we can all get wood,

1256
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,297
one of us will have
the smallest dick.

1257
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,336
And I, for one, do not wanna
have the smallest dick.

1258
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,528
Okay. Two things.

1259
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:02,302
The ladies are gonna be too concerned
about their bodies to think about yours.

1260
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,809
And secondly, that's all myth.

1261
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,477
Women do not care
about penis size.

1262
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,049
Who do you think
has the biggest dick?

1263
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,310
I think I know.

1264
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,147
Boom. Ah!
You're next, Uncle Addie.

1265
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,086
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1266
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,022
No one fucking said anything
about giving any fucking blood.

1267
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,491
Oops.
And can someone explain

1268
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:25,656
why they need to puncture your vein to find
out if there's a problem with your shvanlz?

1269
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,063
Summer after freshman year,

1270
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:32,195
Yeah?
I walked in on one of the guys

1271
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,273
whacking off.

1272
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,569
Shut up. Who?
I won't say.

1273
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,110
No, no, no, who?
Who? Who?

1274
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:43,876
I'm not gonna tell you, but I
will say that it was a monster.

1275
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,714
Hey. That is my blood.

1276
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,355
That used to be
inside you.

1277
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,581
I'm gonna lie down.

1278
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,384
What?
Duquez, Duquez!

1279
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,527
You gotta give us ballpark-
Right, right.

1280
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,684
Like is that...?

1281
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,058
It's more like-
It was like that.

1282
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,597
What?
But the head.

1283
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,291
What?
It's even bigger.

1284
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,696
Mama likes.

1285
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,701
I don't know
if you're gonna like it.

1286
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,139
McCRUDDEN:
Oh, hi.

1287
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,537
Eric?

1288
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,975
Kelly. Uh, we're just
heading back to the city.

1289
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,944
We'll be in touch this week.
Good.

1290
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,138
Regarding the house.

1291
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,217
Of course, the house, yes.
Yeah, I'll page you.

1292
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,088
Dody.
Eric.

1293
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,123
The password this week
is unicorn.

1294
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,319
Well, I don't know
if that'll be nece-

1295
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,769
♪ Moving up end down
Like en elevator ♪♪

1296
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,813
We 're here to share
our experiences

1297
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,746
in creating the perfect orgy
of your personal fantasies.

1298
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:58,325
See that?
Everybody's always touching two people.

1299
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,256
McCRUDDEN:
A little teamwork.

1300
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,952
They're playing
good team ball.

1301
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,428
Okay, I think we get the picture.

1302
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,201
McCrudds, you want some pizza?

1303
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,000
No, I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

1304
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,269
Got an all-I-can-eat buffet
going right here.

1305
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,345
Let me try.
Try this.

1306
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,280
What is that?

1307
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,949
Ohl
Shill

1308
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,454
Oh, he's doing my move.
Look at that.

1309
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,614
He knows the Thoosh.

1310
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,824
Hey, you guys? Guys.

1311
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:40,297
Back to the music. Are we-?
Are we really gonna listen to Indian the whole night?

1312
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,164
I think it might get a little-
Cab ride-y? Agreed. Yeah.

1313
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,636
I'm working on
a killer playlist right now.

1314
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,468
Got some obscure Radiohead.

1315
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,667
Who has sex
to Radiohead?

1316
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,675
Thom Yorke.

1317
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,211
No Radiohead.
No Radiohead.

1318
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,509
I think we need something
sensual, like Sting.

1319
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,049
I love Sting.
McCRUDDEN: No.

1320
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,483
Unacceptable.
Absolutely not fucking Sting.

1321
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,317
That's bullshit, man.
If Sting comes on the fucking stereo,

1322
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,924
guess who's walking.
This guy.

1323
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,151
Sting, it is then.

1324
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,889
So I...
Yeah?

1325
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,362
Got you a little present.

1326
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,558
Really?
Mm-hm.

1327
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,598
It's tilled with some great things
for next weekend.

1328
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,865
It's not my birthday. Oh.

1329
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,201
Hey.
Yeah.

1330
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,902
Look, oh, boy. Oh, wow. Look at that guy.
He's like a Swiss Army dude.

1331
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,343
Wow, that's great.
People are gonna love that.

1332
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,949
Just so you know...
Mm-hm?

1333
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,050
I'm not wearing
any underwear right now.

1334
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,585
Ew, on these stools?

1335
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,518
Well, well, well,
the gang's all here.

1336
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,385
Paciellio!

1337
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,049
Hi.
Paciellio.

1338
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,258
Hi, guys.
What's up?

1339
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,227
We have some business
to discuss.

1340
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:50,030
Right. So Glenn and I
have talked it over and...

1341
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,606
we would like to be
included in the orgy.

1342
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,200
We're in.

1343
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,436
We wanna do it.

1344
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,448
Um...

1345
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,243
No.

1346
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,547
Why not? What-
What?

1347
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,553
We already lined up
my folks to babysit.

1348
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,493
Guys, guys, as a friend
and a mental-health professional,

1349
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,458
I think it is
a horrible idea.

1350
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,723
If you feel disconnected,
I understand-

1351
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,561
Alison, with all due respect,

1352
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:23,067
you're an MA,
I'm an MD.

1353
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:24,928
You're a podiatrist.

1354
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,767
Okay, let's hike a vote.

1355
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,170
How many people want us in?
Right.

1356
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,472
I would just like to say that I
think they maybe have a point here.

1357
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,946
Just because they have a baby doesn't
mean we should discriminate.

1358
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:39,314
Plus, Kate's rack
is killer right now.

1359
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,079
Thank you, Michael.
Yeah.

1360
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:44,748
Jesus, Mike, are you insane?
No. No, no.

1361
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,793
Dude, dude, dude, 10 o'clock.
Ten o'clock. My 10, my 10.

1362
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,428
Shit.

1363
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,260
Hey! Look who it is.

1364
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:54,924
Hi, there it is.

1365
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,968
Hey, uh, this is my Realtor,
Kelly.

1366
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,833
This is the group,
the gang.

1367
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,633
Hi, Kelly.
Hi, Kelly.

1368
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,174
Gosh, I've heard so much
about all of you guys.

1369
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,834
How? When?

1370
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,607
What? Why? What's she talking about?
Let's get a drink.

1371
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,374
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1372
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,316
You think we couldn't handle
this because we're parents?

1373
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,480
Well, we can handle shit
that you can't even imagine.

1374
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,217
You know, you motherfuckers
have no idea.

1375
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,793
That's right.
No idea.

1376
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,123
Come on.
You- You-

1377
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,288
You're all lightweights.

1378
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:28,230
You are all playing JV ball.

1379
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,461
Lightweights.
Whoa.

1380
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,502
All right, Glenn.
Come on, honey.

1381
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:35,839
On a lighter note,
I have this present.

1382
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,473
Dildos.

1383
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:42,548
You know, in a pinch, this would
be great for a toothbrush.

1384
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:47,010
And I have no idea
what this is.

1385
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,486
Hey, Eric, what's up
with all the dildos?

1386
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:52,649
Hey, those are my friends.
Hey, what's going on with the house?

1387
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:57,560
Um, I've been able to slow things down
to buy you till the end of the summer.

1388
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,690
Really? Yeah.

1389
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,494
Oh, you're the best.

1390
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,170
Thank you so much.

1391
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,865
What is that?
What?

1392
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,566
What's going on?
Nothing.

1393
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,507
He told me not to tell
anybody so...

1394
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,010
Yeah, okay.
You know.

1395
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,740
Keep it on the down-low.
Yeah.

1396
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,714
He asked her out
to get them to stall.

1397
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,443
Went on a couple dates,
likes her,

1398
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:23,112
doesn't want to sleep with her before
the orgy because it's wrong to do both.

1399
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,189
Oh. He doesn't wanna
sleep with her.

1400
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,521
That actually means
he likes her.

1401
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,684
Oh.
Awesome.

1402
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,524
Hey. Dildo wave.

1403
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,688
Hi.
Hi.

1404
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,409
Phew!

1405
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,146
Yo, maharajah,
wanna get my back for me?

1406
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,449
What is this shit?
Self tanner, man.

1407
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,456
I wanna look like a porn star.

1408
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,959
Fuck me, I just stroked out
my third batch du jour

1409
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,895
You boys might wanna do the same.
Don't wanna come quick like a bunch of amateurs.

1410
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,865
Oh, God.
I am not touching you.

1411
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,896
Ah, fuck it.
I'm gonna whack it again.

1412
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,803
You look so pretty.
So do you.

1413
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:15,999
Thank you.

1414
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,576
I love it.

1415
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,303
Consider yourself warned.

1416
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:22,847
This absinthe is the real deal.
I had it flown in from Amsterdam.

1417
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:27,249
The guy that sold it to me said it's the stuff
Van Gogh was on when he cut his ear off.

1418
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,582
Oh, no.
McCRUDDEN: Uh-oh.

1419
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,485
It's gonna be
a starry night, huh?

1420
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:31,784
It smells like licorice.

1421
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,291
A toast. A toast.

1422
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,952
To friends.
Ohh.

1423
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:37,495
To friends.
Ohh.

1424
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:41,760
And to making sweet love
with, to, near...

1425
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,164
On.
In.

1426
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,430
Under. And behind.

1427
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,504
All right, salud.
L'chaim!

1428
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,439
Hagalaka.

1429
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,605
Whoo! Sober. Never more.

1430
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,620
The pillows look really nice.

1431
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,125
Yeah.

1432
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,195
These Crate and Barrel or...?

1433
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,829
You guys look great.

1434
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,133
Oh, thanks.

1435
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,640
You look so fucking hot.

1436
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,642
I'm just being honest.
I wanna lick your belly button.

1437
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,839
And yours, your belly button's nice too.
You got a good one too.

1438
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:32,144
I haven't seen yours, but I'm gonna
lick the shit out of that thing.

1439
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,651
Wow.

1440
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,653
As the de facto lead wolf,
right?

1441
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,554
I, uh-
I should kick this mofo off,

1442
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,855
but I gotta be honest with you.
I have no idea what to do, so...

1443
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:44,497
Lead wolf?
Oh, yeah.

1444
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,827
You had to be there kind of.
Tut-tut-tut. Okay.

1445
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,493
Listen up, everybody.
As per usual,

1446
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,538
it is up to me
to get this party started.

1447
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:57,007
Hang on. I got something for you.
Hang on a second, ladies.

1448
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:04,617
Yeah, rock 'n' roll.
Holy moly.

1449
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,843
We're on safari now.

1450
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,078
Yeah.

1451
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,722
How many leopards had to die?

1452
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,017
Just one big old kinky leopard.

1453
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:13,758
They won't kick us out.

1454
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,759
If we're here,
they won't kick us out.

1455
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,296
Okay.
They won't do it.

1456
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,491
And we're totally sure
we wanna do this?

1457
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,437
Yeah.
Yeah.

1458
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,269
Somebody do something. Huh?

1459
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,206
All right? Anybody?

1460
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:36,380
All right, fuck it. I'm gonna call it.
Sue, kiss Alison. I'm gonna start touching myself.

1461
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:40,214
Oh. We could start with a
back-rub circle like in college.

1462
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,118
I'll get things started.

1463
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,726
Yes. Yeah!

1464
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,919
Here we go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1465
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,756
I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't do this anymore.

1466
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,560
I can't.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

1467
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,060
I knew it.

1468
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,400
I knew you'd fucking
puss out, man.

1469
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,804
I'm not pussing out.
I'm in a relationship

1470
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,809
that I really appreciate.
And I don't wanna fuck this up.

1471
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,744
Classic Duquez. You know,
it's like doughnuts, no doughnuts,

1472
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,747
hat, no hat, orgy, no orgy.

1473
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,749
We hike a look-see
through the window

1474
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:15,411
and if it looks, like,
too freaky or lame,

1475
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,114
Yeah.
we hike off.

1476
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,352
And if it looks,
you know, cool, we go in.

1477
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,154
Okay?
Okay.

1478
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,764
I'm not mad at you.

1479
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,264
Eric, Eric. I love
what's going on here,

1480
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,494
but I don't think
you need to insult.

1481
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,264
You should actually communicate.
My God, Alison, please.

1482
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:35,932
Give it a rest? Just one night?
You're uncomfortable with emotion.

1483
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,601
Oh, yeah, I can't. I'm the
only one here with issues.

1484
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,441
It's just me? What about you
and your relationship?

1485
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,776
We broke up.
You broke up?

1486
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:43,939
Yes.
You broke up?

1487
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:47,451
Like you broke up a couple years ago
at the Oktoberfest in July party?

1488
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,681
That kind?
What happened on Oktoberfest?

1489
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:53,122
This one tells me that her and
Marcus are broken up. Over.

1490
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:56,320
We're joking, having drinks,
she tells me about it, we hook up.

1491
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,022
Next morning, she's having
brunch with the guy.

1492
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,498
Whoa, whoa, wait? What?

1493
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:02,965
You never told me this.

1494
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,868
Sue, I don't need to tell you because nothing happened.
We didn't sleep together.

1495
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,373
You told me it was a blowjob,
she wouldn't swallow.

1496
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,670
No, I did not, Mike.
I did not say that.

1497
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,314
It was a fucking hand job.
Hand job. That's right.

1498
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,541
It was a hand job.
I'm sorry. My bad.

1499
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,878
Please don't go there.
No, no, no.

1500
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,386
Alison, shut up.
You're a hypocrite.

1501
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:23,818
What's going on?

1502
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:28,325
First of all, they're dressed
like Indians from India.

1503
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,395
That makes much more sense.
Yeah.

1504
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,328
This is why I don't tell you.
You could've given him a blowjob.

1505
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,833
Why didn't you fuck him?
Why don't you get over it?

1506
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,835
How long are you gonna be
obsessed with Eric?

1507
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:40,863
Oh, shit.

1508
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,399
Wait, what?

1509
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,847
Okay, okay.

1510
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,175
'Urch' your brakes on,
people.

1511
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,875
We are rapidly losing
the erotic vibe.

1512
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:56,012
I'm gonna get this party rocking
right here in a major way.

1513
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,714
What you got, man?

1514
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,258
Ready, set, here we go.

1515
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,692
Oh! Let loose
the Kraken.

1516
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,728
Yeah!

1517
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,868
Will you give it a break, Mike?
This shit's pathetic.

1518
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,594
Oh, fuck you. You fucking pussy.
You're lame.

1519
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,204
You're the lame one, man.

1520
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,706
You don't have a job. You don't have a girlfriend.
You follow Eric around

1521
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:19,209
and do everything he tells you to do.
You're like his little fucking pet.

1522
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,541
Dougie.

1523
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:24,741
Fuck you, Doug.

1524
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:33,426
Is that what you think of me? You think that I'm his-?
You think I'm his fucking pet?

1525
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,255
No.

1526
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:39,454
He meant pet in a nice way.

1527
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:44,226
Is he fucking with me right now?

1528
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:47,606
This is the worst orgy ever.

1529
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,765
Should we just go home
or...?

1530
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,411
No.

1531
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,774
We already got a sitter.

1532
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:56,439
You wanna go see a movie
or you wanna-?

1533
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:01,812
Okay, okay.
All right, time out.

1534
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:04,116
Time out.
Time out, T.O., okay?

1535
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:07,488
I think everyone just needs
to take a deep breath.

1536
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:08,923
All right?

1537
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,365
We need to relax and chill out
for a second, all right?

1538
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,024
Whoa!

1539
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,498
Where are you going?
Ah.

1540
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,763
I'm just going outside
to get some fresh air.

1541
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,429
Clear my head.

1542
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,102
I swear to God, guys,
I thought this was gonna be fun.

1543
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,295
Oh, yeah. Oh!

1544
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,135
Why won't God
just let me have an orgy?

1545
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:05,981
Okay.
All right, here we go.

1546
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,421
Eric.
Kelly, heh, heh.

1547
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,151
What are you doing?
I thought you were with your friends.

1548
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,488
I know. I know. Uh...

1549
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,187
Did you fly here
on a carpet?

1550
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,559
No, heh. No, no. I, uh...

1551
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,668
It's a last-second
costume concept for, uh...

1552
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:27,001
Look, I, uh- I've been thinking about
things and I realized something.

1553
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,866
Oh, shit.

1554
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:31,602
I thought we ordered pizza.
What'd you get, Indian food?

1555
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,338
I'm sorry.

1556
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:38,383
I, uh- Sorry to interrupt.
Sorry.

1557
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,282
Uh, Pete, give us a second?
Hey, hey, hey, Eric.

1558
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,013
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1559
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,248
You didn't call.
I know.

1560
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,087
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1561
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,957
Oh, pizza? Really?

1562
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:52,064
I'm sorry.
No, that's all right.

1563
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,030
Hey, what's up, man?
Eighteen bucks.

1564
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,691
Go, have fun. Hone-

1565
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,031
Honestly. No biggie.

1566
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,536
I'll call you tomorrow.

1567
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,741
Bye.

1568
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:08,581
McCRUDDEN: Like I don't know
that I don't have a girlfriend.

1569
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:14,119
Like I'm not trying to remember that
every fucking night of my life.

1570
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,483
It's hard.

1571
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,056
Hey.
Hi.

1572
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,222
So where were we?
Where'd you go?

1573
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,459
I know, I know, I know,
I, uh... Heh.

1574
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,400
I'm sorry I left. You know, I...

1575
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,940
I'm gonna be honest with you, guys.
Um, I'm freaking outa little.

1576
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,575
I have had the best times
of my life

1577
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,910
with you guys in this house

1578
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:48,748
And I'm gonna miss it.

1579
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,751
I'm gonna miss it so much.

1580
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,292
I love you guys.

1581
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,087
I love every single one of you.

1582
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,263
She wasn't home, huh?

1583
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,766
No. No, She was home.

1584
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,097
She was on a date.

1585
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:09,206
Yeah. And I showed up
dressed like fucking Aladdin.

1586
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,611
Well, I think that
you look adorable.

1587
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:18,115
And I am so happy
that you're back.

1588
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,846
It's been a pretty
emotional night for all of us.

1589
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,355
How about a big
super-gay group hug?

1590
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,551
Oh, yeah.
Group hug.

1591
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:28,786
Yeah.

1592
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,295
Oh! I love you guys.

1593
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,626
Aw!

1594
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,364
Oh, my God.

1595
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,631
Wow.

1596
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:43,072
Oh, my... I would not
have called that.

1597
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,839
Hey, what was that
about earlier?

1598
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:50,347
Yeah, nothing. Later.
What?

1599
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,181
Wha-?

1600
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,051
Oh, gosh!

1601
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:59,488
It's happening.
It's really happening.

1602
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,356
We can do this.
I don't know if I can.

1603
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,224
We'll do it together.
Okay?

1604
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,829
One.

1605
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,271
Two.

1606
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,698
Three.

1607
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,513
Hello, boobs.

1608
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:24,343
Are they okay?

1609
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,178
They're fucking fabulous.

1610
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,016
Thank you.

1611
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:35,453
Oh. And just so you know, um,

1612
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:39,929
I've never been able to orgasm,
so no pressure.

1613
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,034
I'm all about giving pleasure.

1614
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,261
This is so much better
than porn.

1615
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,736
Well, hey-o.

1616
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,382
Oh, my God!

1617
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:57,539
I told you so.

1618
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:58,776
You weren't kidding.

1619
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,388
That is remarkable
that he is insecure.

1620
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,282
Tequila!

McCRUDDEN:
Everybody, drink from the ceiling.

1629
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,591
Hey, Mike.
Hi there.

1630
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:50,794
You guys have gotta try these chocolate-covered
strawberries. They're so decadent.

1631
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:53,269
Oh, no, no. I'm good.
I just had some Bagel Bites.

1632
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,773
Where'd you get Bagel Bites?
Shh. Forget it.

1633
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:58,502
Mahalo, freaky people.

1634
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:02,444
We were thinking it might be fun if we
all went out and made love in the pool.

1635
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:04,948
Yes, yes.
Yeah, you wanna go in the pool?

1636
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,485
No. No, no. We're good
right here. We're good.

1637
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:09,121
Oh, we're okay.
Yeah.

1638
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:12,451
Thanks though.
It's chlorinated. Have fun.

1639
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,954
Sue, I'm so happy
for you.

1640
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,191
All right, Hey, guys, could we
just get a minute? Just a minute?

1641
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,198
Yeah, just give us
a sec, will you?

1642
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:25,304
Oh, so sorry.

1643
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,805
We're not giving you
enough privacy at an orgy?

1644
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:32,571
Oh, kind of a fair hit.
Yeah, now, shh.

1645
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,645
Are you okay?
You wanna talk or something?

1646
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,647
No, no.
Just be in the moment.

1647
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,844
Okay. Yeah, no, can do. Can do.
Okay. Okay.

1648
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,516
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, yeah?

1649
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,159
You like to dirty hall
Yeah?

1650
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,022
Ooh, fuck.
Okay, you wanna fuck me?

1651
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:52,028
You wanna fuck me hard?
No, Sue. Hop off. My foot, my foot.

1652
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,222
Oh, oh, okay.

1653
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:54,492
Oh, foot cramp.
Oh!

1654
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:55,930
Okay.
Ooh, that's a doozie.

1655
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,330
Shh. okay. All right.

1656
01:19:57,492 --> 01:20:00,268
Oh, God, my big toe's so far
away from my other toes.

1657
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,339
Okay, hey.
Hey, Hex it out.

1658
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,170
Flex it out. Flex it, okay.

1659
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,573
Oh, we should have
done this 15 years ago.

1660
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,014
Hey. guys-

1661
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,515
I broke my diet.

1662
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,019
Okay. You're good?
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,055
Yeah? You're good?
Okay. There it goes.

1664
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,557
There it goes. Oh, wow.
Okay.

1665
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:22,456
Shh! Okay. Okay.
Okay.

1666
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,928
Oh, no, it's back.
It's back worse!

1667
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,192
Ooh, it's- The little guy
is in on it now.

1668
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,962
Hey, gang. Sake bombs.

1669
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:41,709
Oh, my God!

1670
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,544
Oh, my God, my dick is having
the best night of its life.

1671
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,585
Oh, we're all fucking.
Oh, we're all finally fucking.

1672
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:49,779
Oh, and I can be as loud
as I fucking want!

1673
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:50,980
Oh, no. Shh, shh.

1674
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:54,959
Owl Ow, my contact.

1675
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:56,561
Alison, my contact.

1676
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,756
I'm good. I'm good. Play through.
Bro, count me down.

1677
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:02,401
What?
Count me down from five.

1678
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:05,595
What does that even mean?
Oh, fuck! Count me down from 10.

1679
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,967
Count him down, Adam.
Just count him down.

1680
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,910
This whole sex in the pool thing
is not working.

1681
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,570
Water is not a lubricant.

1682
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:18,013
McCRUDDEN: Okay, brothers and sisters.
Let's hike this party indoors.

1683
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,846
I'm running with honor!

1684
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,745
Pineapple mojitos.

1685
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:25,591
Yeah, mulched with fresh mint.

1686
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,419
Fuck!

1687
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:29,687
Are you ready?

1688
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:31,956
As I'll ever be.

1689
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,768
Ooh!
I'm next, I'm next, I'm next.

1690
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,030
Vodka tonic.

1691
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:49,548
Yo, can I mg in?

1692
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,151
Oh! You're like the sweet,
tender lion.

1693
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,946
Mike, go away.

1694
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,557
You guys haven't slept with anybody else yet.
You're hogging Willow.

1695
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,385
Go away.

1696
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,323
Go away, Mike.

1697
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:03,519
Vodka.

1698
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:05,956
Come on.

1699
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:10,160
Sue, I just wanna say I'm so sorry
about the whole Eric thing.

1700
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:13,636
No. Totally don't.
It's so over. I don't care.

1701
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:18,471
No, but you know, you're a really
good friend and I love you.

1702
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:22,911
No, I love you.
You are so smart and you're so beautiful.

1703
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,814
And I totally get why he would
wanna be with you.

1704
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,352
You're the beautiful one.

1705
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,354
Oh, my God,
your body is ridiculous.

1706
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,652
Your body
is ridiculous, okay?

1707
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,921
And I would give anything
to have your breasts

1708
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,723
just for, like,
one day.

1709
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:43,358
Yeah, but your ass
is off the charts, seriously.

1710
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,903
Okay. I would kill
to have your eyes.

1711
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:49,838
You know that you have
the most beautiful green eyes

1712
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:53,104
that I have ever seen.

1713
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:00,084
Oh, yeah.

1714
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,748
Oh, yeah.
Oh!

1715
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:08,689
Wow!

1716
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,022
I saw that.
You see that?

1717
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:13,894
It looked like a little flash of light.
I know. I think I just- God.

1718
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,535
I never thought I'd
hear myself say this,

1719
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,898
but I'm gonna
hike a break

1720
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,939
from this
girl-on-girl-on-girl action

1721
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,601
and check the score
of the Yankee game.

1722
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,769
This feels fucking fabulous.

1723
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,041
Ah, Michael!

1724
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,415
Let's go.
Are you sure?

1725
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,557
Yes, 100,000 percent sure.

1726
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,124
Let's go. Right now.
Okay, okay. Let's go.

1727
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:43,888
You fucking did it. Look at this.
You are awe-inspiring.

1728
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,122
Oh.

1729
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:46,458
Thank you, Mike.
No.

1730
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:50,899
I'm gonna tell you something right now and I
want you to listen because I fucking mean it.

1731
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,595
Okay.

1732
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,674
You could be the president
of the United States.

1733
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,442
Well, not after
something like this.

1734
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:02,844
Hey, shh, no.
I'm fucking serious.

1735
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,076
You could do it
if you wanted to.

1736
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,118
Yeah.

1737
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,153
You're getting kind of close,
Mike.

1738
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:11,756
Am I?
Yeah.

1739
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,153
Oh.

1740
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,624
You're not trying to kiss me,
are you?

1741
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,422
Would it scare you if I was?

1742
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,128
I guess so.

1743
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:22,632
Fucking kiss chicken, dude.

1744
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,101
It's on.
All right.

1745
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,933
Let me just
set this right here.

1746
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,665
Whatever.

1747
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,810
You scared yet?

1748
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,010
No.

1749
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,451
McCRUDDEN: No?
Mm-mm.

1750
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:46,114
How about now?
Touching your nose with my nose.

1751
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,488
It's okay,
I'm part Eskimo.

1752
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,630
McCRUDDEN:
We're nose-kissing, buddy.

1753
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,163
It's more than our noses
touching right now.

1754
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,665
It's our souls.

1755
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,505
Yeah, that's been brewing
for years.

1756
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:03,972
Well, I think we both won.

1757
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,842
I'm pretty sure
we both just lost.

1758
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,883
Tonic.
Boo!

1759
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:19,883
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop.
Almost there. Almost there.

1760
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,324
No, don't stop. Don't stop.
Ah! Don't stop.

1761
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,722
It feels so good.
It feels so good, don't stop.

1762
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,591
Hm?
Mmm.

1763
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:30,827
How about that?

1764
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:33,404
So how long
has this been going on?

1765
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:34,835
About a half an hour.

1766
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,998
I'm good. I'm gonna-
I'm getting it. Ah!

1767
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,235
Poor bastard.

1768
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,379
Fucking so good. Aah!

1769
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:41,843
Hang in there, buddy.

1770
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,175
Almost there.

1771
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,615
Yeah. Yes. Yes!

1772
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:48,583
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.

1773
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:51,246
Yes! Oh, yes!

1774
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,016
Yes, yes, yes!

1775
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:56,025
Oh, yes! Yes!

1776
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:58,986
Yes! Aahl

1777
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:21,383
Hey! Good morning, everybody.

1778
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,580
So, uh, look what I got.

1779
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,225
Commemorative Labor Day
orgy T-shirts right here.

1780
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,724
Pink and blue.

1781
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,987
Unisex,
100 percent cotton.

1782
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:31,221
You made T-shirts?

1783
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:32,797
McCRUDDEN:
Yup. Laura.

1784
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,794
Huh?

1785
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:36,967
Where are we gonna
wear these?

1786
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,605
Anywhere.
What do you mean?

1787
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:43,574
Jesus Christ, I am
hungover like a madman.

1788
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:47,106
All right, ladies.
Ladies, I got one-

1789
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:48,804
One easy question for all of you.

1790
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:52,580
Overall,
where would you rank me?

1791
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,151
Just have a bagel and relax.

1792
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,789
Listen, I need to know.
I just- I need to know.

1793
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:00,757
Well, for me,
there was one clear winner.

1794
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:04,488
Okay, I know, good. Eric. Blah, blah.
Big surprise. What about this guy?

1795
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:07,758
I was gonna say Adam.
Adam.

1796
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:09,162
What?

1797
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:11,827
For a neurotic hypochondriac
with panic attacks,

1798
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,473
he was really uninhibited.

1799
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,939
So what? Out of the four dudes
in the house,

1800
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:20,341
I didn't even rank in the top two?
That's what you're telling me?

1801
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,639
Didn't I do my move?

1802
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:24,511
The move with the fingers
and the tongue? The Thoosh?

1803
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,476
McCRUDDEN: Laura.
You did it.

1804
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:29,622
I thooshed you. I know I did.
You don't need to do it now.

1805
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,450
We don't need to see it again.

1806
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,320
Yeah. Can we just
eat breakfast?

1807
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,118
It's Marcus.

1808
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,965
Hello?

1809
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,800
Oh, tell him how much
we missed him.

1810
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:48,130
Hey.
Everybody's up.

1811
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:49,331
Hey.

1812
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:50,703
Morning.

1813
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:53,311
Hey, man, about the shit
that went down last night-

1814
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:57,848
Dude. Oh, shit, I'm sorry if I did anything
weird to you or Willow, like, any thooshing.

1815
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:02,148
Anything like that. I'm sorry.
I was so fucking hammered, I don't remember anything.

1816
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,345
Seriously, nothing?

1817
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:05,513
You don't remember anything?
No.

1818
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,218
Nothing. I remember the fucking
absinthe shots and then that's it.

1819
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:13,833
I'm so bummed, that was gonna be spank
fodder for the next 20 years of my life.

1820
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:16,332
Total fucking blackout.
Thank God.

1821
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:17,731
Amen.

1822
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:18,996
I got something for you.

1823
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,231
Holy shit!
Dougie.

1824
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:23,069
I did it. I got more coming.

1825
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:25,040
Oh, my God, dude,
this is major.

1826
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:29,875
I wanted hat, but he was
so passionate about no hat.

1827
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:32,040
No fucking hat.
Good shit, man.

1828
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,345
I still would've
Photoshopped in the dudes

1829
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,682
schnizzing on your face.
But it's just me.

1830
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:38,255
You made fucking shirts.
Fuck.

1831
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,859
Yeah. Hey, Willow,
grab one of those.

1832
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,858
It's blue and pink,
my favorite.

1833
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:45,930
A medium. Awesome.
It's the Breakfast Club.

1834
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:48,795
Oh, there he is.
Sam Rockwell.

1835
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,197
Ha, yeah, there you go.

1836
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:55,268
Thank you, I'm sorry,
and you're welcome.

1837
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:57,938
Ahh.
Oh!

1838
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:59,305
Still a little sore.

1839
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:03,874
Hey.

1840
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,776
Yeah, I think
we're headed down shortly.

1841
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,485
Yeah, I'll see you there.

1842
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,058
That was Kelly.
Slut.

1843
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,593
Ooh!
Uh, she's, uh,

1844
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,594
headed to the beach.
I'm gonna meet her.

1845
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:21,757
That's gonna be some awkward shit.
I wanna be front-row center.

1846
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,561
Let's do it.
I'm there.

1847
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,063
Give the ticks a goodbye hug
for me, please?

1848
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:29,230
I will do so.
Okay.

1849
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:38,149
I can stay here
and hang out with you if-

1850
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:40,115
Yeah, yes.

1851
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,412
Okay, heh.

1852
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,955
We could, uh, hike a dip
in the pool or something.

1853
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:47,115
Oh, the- Yeah.
I don't know about the pool

1854
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:49,420
after what happened
in there last night.

1855
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:50,654
Ew.

1856
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,929
But you wanna
do the crossword with me?

1857
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:56,099
I'd love that.

1858
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:00,060
Uh, 16 Across.

1859
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:04,299
So, what happened
with, uh, you-know-who?

1860
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:07,446
Marcus apologized.
He wants to go to couples therapy.

1861
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:08,876
You're getting
back together?

1862
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:12,176
We're gonna go to city hall, get
married, see if we can make it work.

1863
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,286
What the fuck(?
Just kidding.

1864
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:19,725
Okay.
Yeah, no, it's totally over.

1865
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,827
Nice.
I'm proud of you.

1866
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:23,291
Thanks, Sue.

1867
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:25,795
That's too bad.
I always liked that guy.

1868
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,558
God, I hope
Kate has some guys for us.

1869
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:30,793
Hell, I'd even go to Hoboken.

1870
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:34,064
I mean, if he's really amazing, I'd
consider going to Jersey City.

1871
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:35,297
Oh, you would not.

1872
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:37,465
I'm just making
a point.

1873
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:40,306
Uh, so Eric, um,
last night,

1874
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,004
Oh.
some things came up.

1875
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,650
Yeah, I swear.
I had no idea.

1876
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:47,013
No, it's fine, really.
It was just something

1877
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:49,155
that I needed
to get out of my system.

1878
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:58,326
I hope she likes
my sloppy seconds.

1879
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,363
Oh, come on.

1880
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:04,393
Morning, Kelly.
Hey. Morning, Eric.

1881
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,334
Hey. Hey.

1882
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:08,371
Hi, I'm Mike.
We haven't officially met.

1883
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:10,668
Nice to meet you.
Oh, wait, Mike.

1884
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:13,870
Right. You're the guy
that Dody was asking about.

1885
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:17,505
She wanted your number for some kind
of business thing or something?

1886
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:22,020
Ah, what the fuck.
Give her my digits, all right?

1887
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:24,213
Nice to meet you.

1888
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:28,019
Let loose the Kraken. Yeah.

1889
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:30,924
So wow. Okay.

1890
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:32,587
About last night.
How about this?

1891
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,528
What?
How about this about last night?

1892
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:37,863
We never talk about it
ever, ever again.

1893
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,096
It never happened.
All right?

1894
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,469
You and I have just met.

1895
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:45,076
We're starting fresh
right here, right now.

1896
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:48,203
Done.
Done.

1897
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:49,541
Hi.
Hi.

1898
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:51,206
I'm Kelly.
Hi, Kelly. I'm Eric.

1899
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:53,215
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

1900
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:05,891
Hey!

1901
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,937
Your BlackBerry.

1902
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:16,803
Ah! Just an empty
symbolic gesture.

1903
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:18,466
I'm getting a new one
on Tuesday.

1904
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:21,944
But that did feel really,
really good.

1905
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,946
So this is the beach, huh?

1906
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:25,607
Pretty beautiful. Who knew?

1907
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:27,753
This is it.
Let's go on.

1908
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,590
Come in!

1909
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:35,289
Okay, listen.
I've got some bad news.

1910
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:36,985
You're at Qaeda.
No.

1911
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:39,495
You know the delay I pulled
with closing the house?

1912
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:41,600
It spooked the buyers
and they pulled out.

1913
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,464
The house isn't sold?
No.

1914
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:48,773
Are you mad?
No. No, no, no.

1915
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,432
Will you hold on
a sec though?

1916
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:51,702
Hey, guys!
Yeah?

1917
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:54,470
Quick announcement.
I have a really shitty Realtor.

1918
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:56,615
McCRUDDEN: Fire her.
And she blew the deal.

1919
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:58,614
And the house still isn't sold.

1920
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:04,350
They're pissed.
They're mad.

1921
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,685
Great, now they're pissed.
They're mad.

1922
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:10,488
Now I gotta start thinking of
something to do for Memorial Day.

1923
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:13,131
We've been kicking around
this idea for a brown party.

1924
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:15,289

brown food.
