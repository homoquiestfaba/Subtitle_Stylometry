00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,277
A FILM BY TOHO

00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:31,573
SHIN GODZILLA

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,500
We have spotted a pleasure boat drifting

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,751
near Haneda.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,336
Very well received.

6
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,632
Pleasure craft confirmed. There appears to be damage to the hull.

7
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,343
Name ... Glory-Maru.

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,889
MJG - 15041. Request owner information.

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,059
We are on board the ship.

10
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,480
Hello? - Is there anyone here?

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,567
There is no one on the upper deck.

12
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,571
No sign of life. Some personal effects ...

13
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,743
No sign of any incident. Perhaps they have fallen into the water.

14
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,914
The boat is empty. Prepare the trailer.

15
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,847
Careful, careful!

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,936
First report of Intelligence and Research.

17
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,939
Aqualine has a leak.

18
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,151
Water is falling on the rails.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,488
There is a liaison office prepared and given emergency notice.

20
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,408
- And the Prime Minister? - will arrive in 28 minutes.

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,577
... I need information below. - Yes.

22
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,957
First confirmed report was 8:30 in the morning.

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,587
Leak in the tunnel Aquafine, about 2.5.

24
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,381
- I want to know how much water comes. - Yes.

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,968
It is entering the tunnel. There are several cars affected.

26
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,054
Coast Guard Hamanami

27
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,806
He is caught in the bay in a cloud of steam.

28
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,351
The Aqualine is closed in both directions.

29
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,354
The Coast Guard has already given the warning.

30
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,689
What is the situation, Mr. Koriyama?

31
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,026
5 confirmed collisions inside the tunnel.

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,111
Could it be a result of an earthquake?

33
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,905
We're checking right now.

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,241
You are having regard to the eruption at sea?

35
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,284
There is not enough information to confirm it.

36
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,911
We have pictures of the helicopter.

37
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,667
A volcanic eruption underwater?

38
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,253
That would be very abnormal.

39
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,465
691 Coast Guard reported. Continuing steam eruptions.

40
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,719
Boiling water prevents visibility under the sea.

41
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,515
We must give a unified initial response.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,183
We have to regroup.

43
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,728
On Catastrophes Unit Please take up all your posts!

44
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,399
Coast Guard Region III has closed the bay.

45
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,110
access either by sea or by earth- are not allowed

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,904
It has issued the evacuation order all along the coast.

47
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,491
Please; evacuate the premises immediately.

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,496
Follow the instructions of the police and Kisarazu evacuate as soon as possible.

49
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,666
OMG! This is filled with water!

50
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,251
There's a leak! Watch your head!

51
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,377
How cool, a slide!

52
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,756
Please; keep calm.

53
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,718
- How cool site!
- My feet hurt.

54
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,052
Come quickly. Do not stand.

55
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,847
Awesome! I'm recording everything.

56
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,977
- What's that noise?
- Ah¡ up something.

57
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,313
Please; remain seated.

58
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,317
This looks bad.
- It gives me bad vibes. What is that?

59
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,777
- Look, there's something. - it does not look good.

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,698
Mr! The Prime Minister has returned.

61
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,035
We can not yet confirm the cause of the rupture of the Aqualine.

62
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,288
I do not care about the details. Are there any fatalities?

63
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,957
- No. Then that address those below.

64
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,502
It is enabled Level 2 alert catastrophe.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,547
I canceled the meeting and come to inform you in 5 minutes.

66
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,090
It is understood.

67
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,384
How likely concerned

68
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,763
an underwater thermal emission and. ' bay floor?

69
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,849
Could it be a nuclear submarine unidentified?

70
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:30,062
Impossible. Tokyo Bay has no depth for a submarine.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,106
We believe that it could be a vapor emission magma.

72
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,859
A new volcanic eruption under the sea.

73
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,070
Sorry, Minister Yanagihara.

74
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,907
The epicenter is shallow and only steam comes out.

75
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,661
We believe that there is volcanic activity.

76
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,122
- I should have told me before! - Sorry.

77
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,209
Could it be a new large hydrothermal escape?

78
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,544
Yes, that must be it.

79
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,213
A leak directly above the tunnel?

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,091
Geological studies rule out that possibility.

81
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,009
Could I having been overlooked?

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,972
Prime Minister ... there is something in the bottom of the sea.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,224
What's "something"? Like what?

84
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,811
A colossal creature. There are even pictures on the Internet.

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,148
Absurd! A giant whale steaming? The sea is boiling.

86
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,568
What creature has a temperature of over a hundred degrees?

87
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,779
We have been reviewing videos Internet

88
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,116
but we have not yet found any conclusive evidence.

89
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,328
We waste time. And if us a process of elimination?

90
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,749
Good idea. A new thermal volcano or a great escape?

91
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,084
What else could it be?

92
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:39,590
Then we must develop the action plan as soon as possible.

93
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,343
- We collect the cabinet, sir? - Of course.

94
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,014
Very good. Let's turn to the meeting room.

95
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,981
Yaguchi ...

96
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,652
You'll have to make do with his decision.

97
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,529
Do not complicate things further.

98
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,199
Should not we consider all possibilities?

99
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,370
It's good to be rebellious, but think about the person who brought you here.

100
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,873
You understand? It is my advice.

101
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,716
All the injured are receiving medical attention tunnel.

102
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:27,346
We have mobilized fire boats and helicopters in Tokyo Bay

103
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,932
and they are prepared to act at any time.

104
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,976
We are in level of preparedness for evacuation

105
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,188
in the coastal region of the bay.

106
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,315
Because of possible rain of debris and ashes,

107
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:43,445
We have canceled all flights from Haneda airport until further notice.

108
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,160
Excuse me farmhouse I said.

109
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,332
The suspension of all flights of Haneda is inevitable

110
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,835
to ensure the safety of citizens,

111
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,878
apart from economic issues.

112
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:05,717
As for the flooding of the tunnel caused by an underwater volcano,

113
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,847
fortunately they not detected toxic gases.

114
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,060
Equipment Meteorological Agency and Coast Guard

115
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,481
They are directed to conduct a thorough investigation.

116
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,323
I WILL report that the eruption is decreasing rapidly!

117
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,625
It's over? It was not time for both.

118
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,754
Prime Minister, let me reiterate

119
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,507
the presence of a large sea creature

120
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,009
as a possible cause.

121
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,970
Yaguchi! This is no place for jokes.

122
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,514
This is a ministerial meeting, minutes of everything rises.

123
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,183
Do not take it as a joke!

124
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,736
Not having time to repair,

125
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,616
those losses can be expected to skyrocket in the next ...

126
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,202
I am sorry! We have to adjourn the meeting.

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,496
Turning the TV!

128
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,708
Is incredible! This is incredible!

129
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,962
I've never seen anything like it! Something out of the water and is huge!

130
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,924
- On their screens you are seeing ...
 - What's that?

131
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,259
- A tail? - Yes, it's a tail.

132
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,430
Yaguchi joke may end up being very serious.

133
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,808
The meeting adjourned. All ministers

134
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,186
They meet in the office of Prime Minister.

135
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,485
So what the hell is?

136
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:51,657
We only know it's a way of life giant unidentified.

137
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,409
We are preparing a list of biologists

138
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,080
and experts from universities and research centers.

139
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,876
We will hold an emergency summit to clarify this.

140
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,128
Hurry up. We need answers.

141
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,005
- YES. - Prime Minister,

142
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,884
maybe we should focus on our response.

143
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:15,138
- Yes of course. - Yes, but this is unprecedented.

144
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,016
I think the options are simple:

145
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,435
let him go, capture and exterminated

146
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,979
or simply chase it away.

147
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,189
I vote for the exterrninación.

148
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,525
I agree.

149
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,402
Look ...

150
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,823
in costs that we have incurred with the tunnel,

151
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,783
the suspension of flights

152
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,703
and the indefinite closure of Tokyo Bay.

153
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:42,332
- I vote for extermination. - And the sooner the better!

154
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,126
Not so, MoD?

155
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,883
We have prepared other times against threats of wildlife,

156
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,011
but the Japan Self-Defense Forces have never used their weapons

157
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,512
in Tokyo Bay.

158
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,974
And why blow it up? We can not scare him away?

159
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,936
Academic and environmental circles

160
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,440
They are asking that we capture him alive,

161
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,067
Since it is a valuable new species.

162
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,404
No, Extermination is the answer. We will launch a torpedo.

163
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,739
The use of weapons

164
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,534
It requires careful consideration of the options.

165
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,289
I am also strongly in favor of captured alive.

166
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:26,168
Begin to gather information on unidentified life forms.

167
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,879
Extermination, capture and expulsion.

168
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,676
Excuse me, who is heading?

169
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,601
It is has spotted a cloud of steam near the Tama River!

170
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,146
- How? Does it move? - He's alive, right?

171
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,651
The creature moves away from Haneda airport, runway D

172
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,862
and he is entering the river topic.

173
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,533
We report that the highway is flooding the bay.

174
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,619
- Again! - We can forget to capture it.

175
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,621
Prime Minister, biologists are coming.

176
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,998
There are only three for now, but ...

177
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,180
For television images can not discern whether it is

178
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,725
of an ancient dinosaur or a species of whale.

179
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:29,147
Seems to be an aquatic species that had not been seen before,

180
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,943
but I can not say so without examined first.

181
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,365
First you have to know if these images are real.

182
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,077
If precipitase me to make a judgment based on untested evidence

183
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,831
I lose my credibility as a biologist.

184
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,170
Please note, the meeting is ending.

185
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,213
This is ridiculous.

186
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,529
- What a waste of time! - I agree.

187
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,072
What a Experts!

188
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,284
- Bring me somebody who knows something. - Yes sir.

189
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,290
Shimura, any ideas?

190
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,835
I have a very competent friend in the Ministry of Environment,

191
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,338
- but it has an important position. - Okay, call it.

192
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,850
Serpentine movement with auxiliary ambulation.

193
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,019
Gills confer water capacity,

194
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,104
but it has legs like an amphibious animal.

195
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,691
If you have legs, you can get on earth?

196
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,446
- Yes, it is a possibility. - Seriously? And so?

197
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:04,326
Honestly, we have not established which agency should act.

198
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,663
Our expert says that a fin-shaped legs

199
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,749
They would be crushed by the weight of the child,

200
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,877
making up ground is physiologically impossible.

201
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,964
Those legs are already supporting her weight.

202
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,300
Really? What do you think, Minister of Environment?

203
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,930
I apologize for the lack of respect for the vice principal.

204
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,224
But as their experts have concluded,

205
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,060
It is very unlikely to climb ashore.

206
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,437
- I get it. - Prime Minister,

207
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,023
taking into account the damage caused so far,

208
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:40,779
the sooner we give a press conference to calm the public, the better.

209
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,241
Sir, if I may, I advise you in the press

210
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,994
communicate only verified information.

211
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,787
Let's go there.

212
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,665
Prepare my uniform.

213
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:17,816
Aqualine tunnels and the Tama River have suffered significant damage.

214
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:22,654
At present, the creature is going up the river Nomi.

215
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,949
We have not yet identified what kind of creature is,

216
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,452
but we do not expect to rise panics.

217
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,080
If you remain stranded in shallow water,

218
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,752
we believe the creature would die crushed by its own weight.

219
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,881
I repeat, there is no danger that the creature up to the shore.

220
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,343
Please, we ask you to remain calm.

221
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,346
Prime Minister, excuse the interruption.

222
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,933
Have you gone to ground?

223
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,604
¡Socorro!

224
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:01,026
Run! Please help!

225
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,278
Go Go!

226
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,240
¡No os rushed! ¡Corred!

227
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,285
Whoops! There was no danger of panicking rise, huh?

228
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,870
I've been a liar!

229
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,372
It was to reassure public opinion.

230
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:17,251
We are asking the experts how it has gone to ground.

231
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,003
Oh, the brood of useless! What's out there?

232
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:24,091
We do not have enough information yet.

233
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,426
Get it. And hurry.

234
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:52,119
We must establish a headquarters for crisis management.

235
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:52,953
It is understood.

236
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:56,582
this cabinet meeting is suspended.

237
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,250
A work everyone.

238
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,420
How much bureaucracy!

239
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,214
To render any decision needed a meeting.

240
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,885
Do not complain about the bureaucracy, which is the basis of democracy.

241
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,304
How to hold a press conference?

242
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,599
We have established a headquarters

243
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,684
Center! Emergency

244
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,353
to combat lifestyle giant

245
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,688
which he has gone to ground.

246
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:23,317
We are preparing a large-scale response

247
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,277
to guarantee

248
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:29,573
safety of citizens, influenced an evacuation of Tokyo

249
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,326
and government agencies ...

250
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,587
The creature goes directly to Shinagawai!

251
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,215
It goes at a speed of about 13 km per hour.

252
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,926
It moves slowly because of its large size.

253
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,762
You can devastate Tokyo in three hours.

254
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,389
The city is very dense and vulnerable.

255
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,267
Prime Minister, could suffer enormous damage.

256
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,186
We have to exterminate it as soon as possible!

257
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,188
It is a highly populated area.

258
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,232
We must evacuate people before.

259
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,359
That emergency services

260
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,986
organize evacuation zones and transport.

261
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,990
We have orders of the Prime Minister

262
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,993
starting the evacuation of the metropolitan area.

263
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,037
Why have so long?

264
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:21,041
The protocol immediate action is not applicable in this case.

265
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,001
I do not care what the protocol says.

266
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,045
Evacuation plan on the fly.

267
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,131
We've never done the mock evacuation as well.

268
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:32,344
An evacuation of the entire city would cause general panic.

269
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,681
Citizens have to evacuate on their own.

270
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,059
We will endeavor to control traffic.

271
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,812
Traffic lights do not work.

272
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,314
Please; They leave their vehicles quickly

273
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,358
siganlias indications and police.

274
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,195
Attention citizens. The government in Tokyo

275
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,531
He has ordered the total evacuation of Shinagawa.

276
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,077
All residents must evacuate immediately.

277
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,308
Come on! Run, honey!

278
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,120
At this rate, the city will be in ruins.

279
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,207
Contact the Public Safety Commission.

280
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,502
We can seek the help of Self-Defense Forces

281
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,420
for exterminating pests.

282
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,255
And use weapons?

283
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,133
According to Article 76 could be considered an armed attack

284
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,636
and Self-Defense troops could use force.

285
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,180
This can not be considered an armed attack.

286
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,225
It should be the attack of an aggressor or equivalent country.

287
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,143
But this is no time for semantic dissertations.

288
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,186
We can not do anything.

289
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:09,066
Only Self-Defense Forces are equipped to respond.

290
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,778
But that means soldiers participating in an urban combat.

291
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,280
That will earn time the Prime Minister.

292
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,911
Prime Minister, we need a plan that includes

293
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,705
the use of military force and the evacuation of citizens.

294
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,166
You have to declare a state of emergency.

295
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,836
Our only measure now

296
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,505
It is the mobilization of troops,

297
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,466
but that can only be done by order of the Prime Minister.

298
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,555
They are talking about an unprecedented statement.

299
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,350
We would be mobilizing the country for war.

300
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,896
The police can not handle an evacuation of this magnitude,

301
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,731
but if we mobilize troops,

302
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,527
there is the possibility of collateral damage.

303
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,945
No, I do not want that.

304
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,739
We could not ask US to kill the beast

305
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,741
welcoming us to the Security Treaty?

306
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,620
No, our government and Self-Defense Forces must act first.

307
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,166
Under the Treaty, USA We can only provide support.

308
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,585
We face a living organism.

309
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,172
If we cause only we get to cause further damage.

310
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,132
Yes, it is a living organism.

311
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,927
And that means we can stop it,

312
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,388
we could not if an earthquake or a typhoon.

313
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,266
Protecting citizens is top priority.

314
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,730
It's a tough decision, sir, but we need your authorization

315
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,690
to prevent further calamities.

316
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,068
At this very moment? Really?

317
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,404
The time is gold. It is in your hands.

318
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,492
A few moments ago, the Prime Minister has decided

319
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,494
declare a state of national emergency,

320
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:48,749
which it means, for the first time in history,

321
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,753
the mobilization of the Self Defense Forces

322
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,255
and the first military action in Japan

323
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:58,300
since World War II.

324
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,760
As is the extermination of a pest,

325
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,803
no parliamentary approval is needed.

326
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:06,016
The metropolitan government has mobilized Division Nerima wing.

327
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,852
They guide the evacuation, but are not equipped for combat.

328
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,439
Assault helicopters are the fastest.

329
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,233
Contact base Kisarazu.

330
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,319
- We deploy the F-2 Misawa? - Do not.

331
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,572
Any civilian casualty Self-Defense Forces would hurt forever.

332
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,407
It is necessary to minimize the use of weapons.

333
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:27,371
But we do not know his strength. I think we should be prepared.

334
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,455
I agree.

335
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,292
We recommend an integrated operation of the three forces.

336
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,086
Call the Prime Minister.

337
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,966
The joint force will be led by the Eastern Army.

338
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,926
The goal is the extermination of the creature.

339
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,930
If ground troops focus only on the evacuation,

340
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,184
The helicopters will be the main strike force.

341
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,395
Lord, because it is the city,

342
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,523
some elderly and sick should stay here.

343
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,985
So I can not make a decision without an inspection.

344
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:03,073
In cases like this there will inevitably be some collateral damage.

345
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:07,161
Lord, I know it is not easy,

346
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,621
but we need a decision.

347
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,332
It is understood.

348
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,883
It is a very risky mission. Do I ask for volunteers?

349
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,885
No, the standard rotation.

350
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,137
We get ready for that.

351
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,100
Kisarazu took off at 13:08.

352
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,519
Estimated arrival time 13:20. Change.

353
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,401
What a relief!

354
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,447
That creature will be great, but this should suffice.

355
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:47,576
Maybe we can rebuild the city with his body.

356
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:50,245
Ministro Yanagihara,

357
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:53,123
the delusions and theories of office

358
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,834
the old Imperial Army during the last war

359
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,212
They caused the loss of three million lives.

360
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,506
Beware the unfounded optimism.

361
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,147
Beware the steps. Keep calm.

362
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,816
Get out of here right away.

363
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,569
Local evacuation centers are useless.

364
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,239
Tell us where to send people!

365
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,557
The creature has stopped!

366
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,393
Have you stopped? Why suddenly?

367
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,800
Amazing.

368
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,179
It is evolving.

369
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,940
Attack 1, here Control Center. Change.

370
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,858
Control Center here Attack 1. Change.

371
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:28,070
Dirínjanse to the containment zone 2 and wait for orders.

372
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,738
Attack 1, received.

373
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,957
It is not what we had been told.

374
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,416
Here Offense 1.

375
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,670
The objective differs from the report.

376
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,133
Attack 1, hold position and await further instructions.

377
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,136
Complete evacuation of residents.

378
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:57,307
It is understood. Minister, we are ready to open fire.

379
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,225
It is understood.

380
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:02,437
Lord, we are ready. when you say.

381
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,149
It's okay. Ahead.

382
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:10,070
Attack 1, open fire.

383
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,657
I repeat, open fire.

384
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,285
Received Control Center. Opening fire.

385
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,830
The objective is opposite. Aim for the head.

386
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,334
Distance, 300 meters. Prepared. Stop the fire!

387
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,723
Why do not you shoot?

388
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,601
No civilians near the firing line.

389
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,478
There are civilians present. Can we shoot?

390
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,606
There are civilians present. Can we shoot?

391
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,482
There are civilians present. Can we shoot?

392
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,862
There are civilians. Can we proceed with the shooting?

393
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,072
Prime Minister, we have to abort.

394
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:56,700
Stop the attack!

395
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,205
He is right. Abort the attack, right now.

396
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,040
Civilians can not be injured.

397
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,500
Attack 1, paid the attack.

398
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,002
Back to waiting positions. Change.

399
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:09,421
Received. We abort! Keeping positions!

400
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,191
The creature moves again!

401
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,737
Be opens the way down the highway! It's heading to Tokyo Bay!

402
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,837
They have canceled all flights.

403
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,756
A new fire in Shinagawa.

404
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,967
Most trains operate.

405
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,804
We send support from abroad ...

406
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,514
... with more supplies and support staff.

407
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,725
The Tokyo Stock Exchange works again.

408
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:08,230
The bullet train operates its usual route between Yokohama and Shin ...

409
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:13,902
They have legacy scientists from France and other nations.

410
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,864
has not been sighted the creature in the Uraga Channel,

411
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,116
so the search area expands.

412
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:22,870
The number of fatalities has risen to one hundred.

413
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,081
Ola fires are extinguished.

414
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,751
Minister of Disaster Management Kanai

415
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:33,672
leading a delegation to monitor and assess damage.

416
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,847
He was alone on the land about two hours ...

417
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,058
- ... and look what he did. - Do not.

418
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:51,064
We had two hours to assemble an initial response. Disappointing.

419
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,567
It was all by surprise. He could not be avoided.

420
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,155
Everyone did what they could under the circumstances.

421
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,574
Not to boast, Yaguchi.

422
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:05,204
It's time to meet the press, Mr. Minister. Here.

423
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,914
It's okay.

424
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:52,167
We believe that is in the sea near Kanaya.

425
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,504
We are increasing surveillance and patrols

426
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:58,048
by Chiba and Sagami Bay.

427
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:02,469
But if it is hidden in the Sagami channel will be impossible to detect.

428
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,973
Who knows when or where reappear?

429
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,767
How are the preparations?

430
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,814
Once spotted the creature, a ground attack

431
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,691
by the water, it will be difficult.

432
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,360
Plans need ...

433
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,864
to locate a point of landing and patrol persecution.

434
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:23,782
I'll get on it.

435
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,911
We anticipate attacks with artillery, tanks and F2.

436
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:32,666
Defensive maneuvers are focusing on the Kanto area.

437
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,252
The metropolitan area has priority.

438
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,713
It seems that the order comes from the fifth floor.

439
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:40,549
And what about the regions?

440
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,720
13 million people, a GDP of 85 trillion yen ...

441
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,347
It is 17% of the total.

442
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:51,810
And the Kanto region accounts for 40% and 200 trillion.

443
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,939
It seems a prudent strategy.

444
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,859
Protecting a country is not easy.

445
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,278
They have assigned a rapid response team

446
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,405
the residence of the Prime Minister.

447
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,617
And I have been told that you have appointed

448
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,620
its chief operating officer. I see you progress.

449
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:14,041
You want to choose the team. You know the bureaucrats.

450
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,836
I look for people who are not afraid to tell the truth.

451
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,088
If people with guts.

452
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,299
- Soy Tachikawa.
- Takeo.

453
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,926
Ready? Above.

454
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,857
Soy Rando Yaguchi.

455
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:42,236
It will function as a flat organization.

456
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:46,365
No titles or seniority. All speak freely.

457
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:50,744
So is. Officially, I'm in charge, but we're an elite team

458
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:54,623
composed of lone wolves, nerds, liantes, marginalized,

459
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,751
heretics and enemies of the academic bureaucracy.

460
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:01,129
Every man for himself. These are the basic specifications.

461
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,965
Find out what you can.

462
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,181
- This is all? - So is.

463
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:15,936
We fill in what is missing. If you have information, share it.

464
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,105
The "expert advice" yesterday ...

465
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,984
He could not reach any conclusion.

466
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,152
I have prepared a simple profile.

467
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,905
We have seen three different configurations.

468
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,533
But they come more mutations. - There is more?

469
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:34,621
We are analyzing a sample of body fluid.

470
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,624
Give me a little. I'll help out.

471
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:41,086
USA It has taken all the samples we had left.

472
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,673
The remains of the creature they burn off the stench.

473
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:48,010
Under pressure from the Americans, they tell me.

474
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,304
We allow ourselves the analysis to you.

475
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,806
And what do we know about its biology behavior?

476
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,100
It seems that simply moves.

477
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,686
We can not confirm it smart.

478
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:01,315
I think he's communicating with something very improbable.

479
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:05,068
A very simple question. What is your source of energy?

480
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,573
You need an enormous amount of energy, not only to move,

481
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,241
but at the metabolic level.

482
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:15,787
With the conversion of oxygen in your digestive tract is not sufficient.

483
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,956
All that energy ...

484
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,586
Nuclear fision?

485
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,798
It has a great sense of humor, Ms. Ogashira.

486
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,967
That's impossible.

487
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,722
An American aircraft carrier leaves the port?

488
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,684
We have learned that the alert has jumped radiation

489
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,520
in the city of Yokosuka.

490
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,606
I'll call the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.

491
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,692
I have orders not to go public yet,

492
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:49,154
but radiation levels in the metropolitan area have risen.

493
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,533
Is there a leak? A reactor?

494
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,371
We have not found any reactor leaks in the country.

495
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,122
And then, where does it come?

496
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,797
Could it be possible!

497
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,511
These data show that the radiation peaks

498
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,263
match the path it has traveled the creature.

499
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,517
Look at this.

500
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,019
¿Lo ve?

501
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:29,528
-. Ms. Ogashira was right. - Sorry.

502
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,374
The information is reaching the public.

503
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,836
Contact the Secretary of the Cabinet.

504
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,132
This is a problem.

505
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,343
The Prime Minister should convene a press conference.

506
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:58,182
No evidence that this creature is radioactive,

507
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,017
We could stoke public fear.

508
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,437
These levels are not sufficient for evacuation.

509
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,064
There is no legal basis for approval.

510
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,484
But still it remains a matter of radioactivity.

511
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:13,947
- The sooner the better. - You're right. I'll talk to the press.

512
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:16,200
Let me talk to the Prime Minister.

513
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:20,787
Convene a press conference in five minutes.

514
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:25,292
Yes, President Ross, I understand. Thank you.

515
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:31,423
There are many unilateral demands.

516
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,093
Typical Americans.

517
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,429
An aide to US President

518
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,099
She wants a secret meeting with the Prime Minister.

519
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,268
They move fast.

520
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,855
Just leave Yokota Air Base.

521
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,775
Foreign Minister is furious.

522
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:57,032
- I think his assistant wants to see you. - To me? For what?

523
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,285
I read the reports of his administration.

524
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,163
I need a person with whom you can work.

525
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,083
With an interesting history. And that's you.

526
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,376
It is an honor,

527
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,963
but I think it refers to the adviser to the Prime Minister, Akasaka.

528
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,007
Can I refuse entry?

529
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:17,052
I need a favor not spill my record.

530
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,222
I want you to meet someone.

531
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:23,225
And who is it?

532
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:29,022
A man who predicted the appearance of her child several years ago.

533
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:34,194
Are you interested? He landed in Narita seven days ago.

534
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:35,779
Goro Maki.

535
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,158
Japanese. Former professor of college.

536
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:43,078
Its intelligence agency is the best.

537
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:44,746
And what we get along?

538
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:52,004
An exchange. We have gathered information that might interest them.

539
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:55,257
But it must be bilateral, okay?

540
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:58,552
Only the United States and Japan. So, we all win.

541
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,390
It is understood. To work. - Thank you.

542
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,767
I have run out of a party,

543
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:09,980
I have not had time to change. Is there a Zara here?

544
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:14,193
Kayoco Anne Patterson. It's very young.

545
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,321
In U.S.A. performance is valued over age.

546
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,907
And she is the daughter of Senator Patterson.

547
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:24,286
Kern responsible for the Agreement. Is awesome.

548
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,998
A mixture of talent, pedign 'and beauty.

549
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,669
- I suspect it will not be his type. - Do not.

550
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,341
If you use the contacts of his father brazenly ...

551
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,719
Is the typical politics as Yaguchi.

552
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,849
Looking for a person at a time?

553
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,935
Es para Rando Yaguchi.

554
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:53,607
I owe a lot to his father. Give all players need.

555
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,109
This is your profile.

556
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:02,825
An elderly rebel teacher, sent off on his day Japan.

557
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:07,204
Although it is a biologist, he worked at a US nuclear company

558
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,664
An interesting old.

559
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:13,377
- Do we have to stop? - No, just locate him.

560
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:16,880
The NSA or the CIA will do the rest.

561
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,633
Discreetly, I am told.

562
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,844
His last whereabouts.

563
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,930
How quickly does the country of my grandmother!

564
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,932
But it has vanished.

565
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,978
The Coast Guard found the boat adrift at sea.

566
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,981
Ms. Patterson ...

567
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:38,443
Were you looking teacher or sought this?

568
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,070
Yes, that too.

569
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,490
"I did what I felt like. You do the same. "

570
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:45,742
Do your last words?

571
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:50,289
- You want to confirm the contents? - Needless.

572
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,249
I trust you.

573
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,793
It is a special ink. You can not be copied.

574
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,421
I will take photos to share with my team.

575
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:02,676
¿Godzilla?

576
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:08,348
So is. It is a codename Department of Energy. Godzilla.

577
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,100
I got an English name.

578
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,354
Gojira ... What does it mean?

579
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,524
I found something.

580
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,027
On the island of Ohdo, where he is the teacher,

581
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,779
means "incarnation of God".

582
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,034
And very violent. That's why I put him "God" in the name.

583
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:31,330
In Japanese, what you read is Gojira.

584
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:35,209
Gojira. What is that?

585
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:39,171
What else gives its name to this point?

586
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:42,758
It does not matter that originates in the United States.

587
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,719
At least now we know what to call it.

588
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:51,016
The government has decided to use the unofficial name of Godzilla

589
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,810
referring to the giant creature.

590
00:39:55,103 --> 00:40:00,025
Goro Maki, former professor of biology at the University of Jonan.

591
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,779
Find out who he was.

592
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:07,449
When the time comes we will give exclusive

593
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,827
to publish history.

594
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:15,040
- I promise, Hayafune. Yes, I know.

595
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,130
This is 60 years ago.

596
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:26,510
They are non-regulation discharges of radioactive material.

597
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,141
Can not be...

598
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:37,229
- Gojira ate such discharges. - Yes.

599
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,523
It is the conclusion of the Department of Energy.

600
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,944
They sent requests to several institutions ...

601
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:45,445
to analyze the containers.

602
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,614
Dr. Maki was the main figure.

603
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:51,618
Suddenly, an ancestral species of marine life

604
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:54,580
I was surrounded by radioactive discharges

605
00:40:55,122 --> 00:41:00,252
and quickly he mutated into an organism that could withstand radiation.

606
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:04,173
That's the theory of Godzilla. - But his body grew

607
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:06,800
when he left the sea.

608
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,138
You can suddenly mutate marine to terrestrial organism.

609
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:15,017
This new Godzilla beyond anything I could imagine.

610
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,978
That's all the information I have.

611
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,606
And what comes now ...

612
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,233
My personal assistant.

613
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,951
Is what Dr. Maki was left?

614
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,748
I do not understand anything.

615
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:42,920
There is a molecular structure. What relationship will have with Godzilla?

616
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:46,882
It could be an analytical table of the structural layers.

617
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:51,094
Dr. Maki left out deliberately final data.

618
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,514
But now we have the full version.

619
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,766
Would you care to analyze it?

620
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,935
- Can we take pictures? - Clear.

621
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:07,194
It gives me fatal Japanese protocol. Can we be more infonnales?

622
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:08,987
Well tell me.

623
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:14,535
What do you do USA with Godzilla? I study him or exterminate?

624
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:17,454
That is up to the President.

625
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,500
Who decides in your country?

626
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:30,008
Finally, a decision on relief and recovery law.

627
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:33,387
Collaboration between agencies will be difficult to Godzilla Law.

628
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:36,098
The lack of precedent slow orders.

629
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:39,184
Everyone will try to pass the ball.

630
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:42,187
At least Security Act was easily approved.

631
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,898
Foreign imposed under US pressure

632
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:48,277
USA He wants to use his information on Godzilla

633
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,987
as a diplomatic card.

634
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:53,657
Aide Akasaka pray that knows how to handle the White House.

635
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,743
They are the analysis of the place dela catastrophe.

636
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,038
Gamma rays do not match any known element.

637
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:02,833
Is incredible! Godzilla is, right?

638
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,170
His body has led to new elements.

639
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:11,800
Why the US Department of Energy He has acted so quickly.

640
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,052
We get this data.

641
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,804
Prime Minister calls.

642
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:20,184
It is understood. More problems and complications.

643
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,855
So how much have you?

644
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:28,192
We have analyzed the substances listed

645
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,152
in the track left Godzilla

646
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:34,281
there is a 0.5 microsieverts radiation in the affected area.

647
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:37,993
Thanks for the food. - Yes thanks.

648
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,538
Even with the information that has happened USA,

649
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,457
I sense that we're going to get stuck.

650
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,918
If the Riken report has had its impact.

651
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:49,505
Godzilla has 8 times more genetic information than humans.

652
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:52,716
It takes years to sequence it.

653
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:56,803
Godzilla is the most evolved creature on the planet.

654
00:43:57,054 --> 00:44:00,807
Capable of self-mutilation and regenerate.

655
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,310
That surpasses human intelligence.

656
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,855
But still deadly. You may be kill.

657
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,232
I hope so.

658
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,985
It's what we have to find out:

659
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,530
¿Possible causes of this behavior?

660
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:16,073
Just walk.

661
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:19,952
Why is there suddenly decided to return to Tokyo Bay?

662
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,416
I have it. To cool down.

663
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:32,714
Gojira has a kind of nuclear reactor built.

664
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,259
Their fins are vents.

665
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,511
The mixture is cooled based blood.

666
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,597
It has become temporarily marine creature

667
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,934
to adjust its body temperature after mutate.

668
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,602
Perhaps our only hope

669
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:48,897
passes off its internal cooling system.

670
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:53,193
And that would force him to restart the reactor to stay alive.

671
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:58,073
Rapid cooling may not come to kill, but to immobilize.

672
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:01,702
Would administer a drug such as blood clotting.

673
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:03,954
And that is possible if you are standing?

674
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:06,540
We examine what methods to implement.

675
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:09,334
Perhaps a compression pump.

676
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:12,379
We, the Ministry of Health and Economy

677
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,257
We meet the coagulant and the necessary equipment.

678
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:18,343
Introduce him to the Prime Minister as the Plan Yaguchi.

679
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:19,469
It is understood.

680
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,557
Names aside, to work.

681
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,102
Godzilla is God!

682
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,521
¡Salvad a Godzilla!

683
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,443
Godzilla is God! Salvad Godzilla!

684
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,347
Good Morning. A tea? Thank you very much.

685
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,766
Thank you very much.

686
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,770
Listen. We could use a break.

687
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:11,355
Very good.

688
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,825
Everyone is working voluntarily.

689
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:26,495
They go home to rest, even when asked.

690
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:31,458
0 return early the next day with hot food for everyone.

691
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,503
It is an inspiration.

692
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:38,549
No trace of all these struggles between ministries.

693
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:41,343
Only people working together.

694
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:42,928
And there are many people outside

695
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,223
who has also devoted his time tirelessly.

696
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,267
You are right.

697
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:53,480
There is still hope for this country, really.

698
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:58,485
But I have a question, when you change your shirt?

699
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,948
The truth is that it smells a little bad.

700
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:06,118
For real?

701
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:09,079
You could use a good shower good.

702
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:18,213
Godzilla has appeared in Sagami Bay!

703
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:19,840
And it is up to the ground.

704
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:40,611
Red alert! They tell us that Godzilla has gone to ground!

705
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:44,114
Conveying red alert for the entire national network!

706
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:48,494
He speaks the Disaster Prevention Unit of Kamakura.

707
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:53,207
This is an emergency evacuation order.

708
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:57,878
An unidentified creature colossal size has gone to ground.

709
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:02,299
We urge all residents to evacuate the city immediately.

710
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:05,052
I repeat, evacuate immediately.

711
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:11,892
Please follow the instructions of the police and the fire department.

712
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,769
The first Minister!

713
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,931
Godzilla Kamariya directly advance.

714
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:54,226
Have I gone mad or is bigger?

715
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:56,520
Much more than we could expect.

716
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,647
He has changed the face and body.

717
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,233
Yes, it has doubled in size.

718
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:04,945
It has evolved to its fourth state.

719
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,827
This will be a catastrophe.

720
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:25,382
Attention citizens! Take refuge inside their homes!

721
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:29,386
This area is under curfew!

722
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:33,891
They are located in a designated evacuation area!

723
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:37,227
Attention citizens!

724
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:57,289
Godzilla is expected to reach Tokyo in about three hours.

725
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,583
Why return here again?

726
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,733
With a direct attack on his body

727
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,570
We run the risk of releasing radioactive material.

728
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:33,367
Prevent progress towards the metropolitan area is the highest priority.

729
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,995
It seems to live the radioactive material.

730
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:41,917
If attacked a nuclear plant, it would be an even greater catastrophe.

731
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:46,964
Prime Minister, we have to stop now.

732
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:51,343
Should not think that abroad we are afraid.

733
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,887
How's your Yaguchi Plan?

734
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,098
Unfortunately, it is not finished.

735
00:50:56,348 --> 00:51:00,102
The order and Self-Defense Forces will do their job.

736
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,565
A state of emergency remains in force.

737
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:09,945
Still has authority to order an attack.

738
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,490
Lord ... - I know.

739
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:17,703

740
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,497

00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,545
We have permission to use weapons without restrictions.

743
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,966
We must do everything necessary to keep Godzilla outside Tokyo.

744
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:33,260
We will use Plan B if it appears in Kanagawa.

745
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:37,890
Kawasaki will be the main battlefield.

746
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:41,518
And the Tama River is the last line of defense.

747
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:43,520
Good luck.

748
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:47,316

Eight minutes to contact!

756
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,135
- You really are going to open fire? - Quiet, it's like a drill.

757
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:18,096
The target contains radioactive material.

758
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,725
Concentrate your shots to the head and legs.

759
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,560

We have confirmation of the total evacuation of the area.

772
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:05,435
Koriyama, are you sure this time? Do not fall behind?

773
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:10,482
- Should I trust the field report. - The target progresses.

00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:12,776

787
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:15,464
Commander requests permission to use missiles.

788
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:20,552
There are many buildings, but we have no choice.

789
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,096
Right now...

790
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:27,017

798
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:10,143
- Not even the missiles work? - What is that thing?

799
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:13,397
Your skin is too thick to perforate.

800
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:15,274

Laser activated.

827
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,577
The goal turns to the northwest! Repeat going northwest!

828
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:34,538
- Are you running away? - Is working?

829
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,625
- Now comes the second wave. - This really will kill him.

830
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:50,387
Good!

831
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,434
To all the tanks, retreat!

832
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:29,092
Evacuate!

833
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,303
Evacuate!

834
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:38,143
The goal has crossed to Tokyo!

835
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:41,480
Control here C - 01. Helicopters ammunition.

836
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,565

838
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:48,654

00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:50,614
Eight units of ammunition.

840
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:53,951
Three tanks with major damage and two unused. Change.

841
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:03,460
Put command destroyed! He has crossed the line of defense!

842
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:07,923
Line defense has fallen.

843
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:15,180
Still within reach of our artillery.

844
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:17,015
We must continue!

845
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:20,936
Do not! Those districts have not been evacuated completely.

846
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,189
I'm afraid that's all we can do

847
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,191
It is understood.

848
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:29,236
the operation is suspended.

849
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:32,322
I am sorry. We could not even stop it.

850
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:35,909
Do not lose hope. Our mission is to protect people.

851
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:40,247
The offensive is not the only solution. Accelerates evacuations.

852
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:43,542
The operation has failed. Gojira moves again.

853
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,211
Self-Defense entire arsenal has been useless.

854
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,047
It has a capacity of incredible survival.

855
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:52,676
If conventional weapons worked, we would not be here.

856
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:55,387
A perfect body than man.

857
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,564
The target enters the Meguro district!

858
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:10,527
We must ask for help from US to destroy him.

859
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:12,654
Lord, the US ambassador confirms

860
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,033
that their bombers are on their way.

861
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:22,706
Present an official request for cooperation.

862
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:24,416
I will meet with the ambassador.

863
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,961
I will give a press conference to explain the issue.

864
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:31,715
We have requested assistance from the US Air Force. based in Japan

865
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:35,010
to fight Godzilla under the Security Treaty between the two.

866
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,029
This is the area bombing proposed.

867
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,158
A big area? That would cause more harm than Godzilla.

868
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:01,954
Wing evacuate people dugouts.

869
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:05,082
USA. He will launch an attack on Godzilla.

870
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:09,002
Evacuate subway stations and underground galleries.

871
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:20,264
Do not push!

872
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:49,668
This residence is located in the path of Godzilla.

873
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:52,087
Self-Defense Forces have not gotten stopped

874
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,590
and maybe the Americans either.

875
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,051
You want me to leave my residence?

876
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,931
Yes! And other key controls should also be addressed immediately

877
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,059
some ancillary facilities in Tachikawa.

878
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:09,229
The American attack is about to begin.

879
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,775
My duty to stay to oversee its implementation.

880
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:17,404
I can not abandon citizens to flee.

881
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:20,073
Prime Minister, if you can leave,

882
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,204
because his duty is to protect the nation. Please evacuate.

883
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:28,123
Tokyo City Hall still works.

884
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:31,919
For now, let the Governor Kozuka take over.

885
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:35,047
It's okay.

886
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,341
Two helicopters reach the roof.

887
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:39,593
We will go by car.

888
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:44,223
Well ahead. Although it will take time.

889
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,101
There will be a traffic death.

890
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:53,065
- See you soon. - All right. I'll crawl if necessary.

891
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:57,277
Mandatory evacuation order! Evacuate the building immediately!

892
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:20,592
It's all blocked. Traffic is not moving.

893
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:25,472
The attack is coming. We must get everyone out of here.

894
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:37,109
So that's Godzilla!

895
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:40,821
They have decided to bring forward the attack!

896
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:51,665
American bombs have hit the target. It's bleeding!

897
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:57,504
- It seems to work! - Way to go, USA

898
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,308
Lord, as the helicopter arrives.

899
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:25,824
Slowly! Everybody down!

900
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:27,409
What's that glow?

901
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:43,926
The back of Godzilla shines! There is no more data!

902
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:45,969
What are you going to do?

903
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:15,123
There's nobody left.

904
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:17,167
Come inside!

905
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,295
Emergency call airbase.

906
01:05:20,504 --> 01:05:22,422
THE 8 - 2 number 1 has been demolished.

907
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:25,551
It can not be: That's impossible.

908
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:32,558
Godzilla, the authentic reincarnation of a god.

909
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,769
The target shooting with a gun from the front.

910
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:38,438
3 - 2 and 3 - 3 and continue from the rear.

911
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:42,317
- It's time for revenge. Received. Revenge.

912
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:16,685
We transport the Prime Minister and another 8 people Tachikawa ...

913
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,710
high levels of radiation are anticipated.

914
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:27,756
It is advised to stay home at least 48 hours.

915
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:32,386
How much radiation has issued Godzilla over Tokyo?

916
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:35,430
We can not keep waiting for the government to act.

917
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,058
They say there is a lot of radioactivity.

918
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,978
Will they distribute iodine tablets?

919
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:44,439
They are mobilizing nuclear response teams,

920
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:49,319
biological and chemical decontamination work for and rescue.

921
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:52,239
Prime Minister, the 'secretary' cabinet

922
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:56,577
and 5 other ministers more have disappeared.

923
01:07:56,827 --> 01:08:00,956
Police headquarters and two ministries remain intact.

924
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:20,476
It is estimated that millions of people will lose their home.

925
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:24,771
Spokesmen for. ' government hope to avoid a political vacuum.

926
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,984
Party members will choose a prime minister in office.

927
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:32,029
The residence of the Prime Minister in danger,

928
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:36,158
the government has moved its headquarters to Tachfkawa,

929
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:39,536
At the center of the city.

930
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:47,294
Deputy Chief Yaguchi!

931
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,213
- I will call you later. - Mr lzumi ...

932
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:50,839
Good thing you're safe.

933
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:55,052
And to think I go home on Friday is what saved me.

934
01:08:55,260 --> 01:09:00,474
- You are injured. You're good? - I am sorry. There is a shortage of bandages.

935
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:02,810
Does not matter. Is nothing.

936
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:05,229
The council directs the work of firefighters and rescue.

937
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:06,855
The ministry does not intervene.

938
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:08,690
Let the police take care of those affected.

939
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:10,776
They will spend night.

940
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:14,279
Rumors fly, so go ahead reporters.

941
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:17,658
I need information. Where is Godzilla?

942
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:21,495
It is idle, near Tokyo Station. Who knows why?

943
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:22,996
¿Radiation levels?

944
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:27,042
Nuclear Regulatory Authority is taking readings.

945
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:32,714
Godzilla mouth spits radiation but very small traces.

946
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:34,842
The radioactive cloud has gone into the sea,

947
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,636
but there is a lot of pollution.

948
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,514
The most affected districts are uninhabitable,

949
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,349
besides being contaminated.

950
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:45,102
If the circumstances are very serious.

951
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,689
Lack of men, material and legal infrastructure.

952
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:50,399
They're all dead.

953
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:54,361
The Prime Minister, the Cabinet Secretary. Everybody.

954
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:56,697
Do not derrumbéis!

955
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,158
We'll manage the survivors!

956
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:00,409
Yaguchi ...

957
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,620
First you have to calm down.

958
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:22,973
I am sorry.

959
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:27,728
Who is the acting Prime Minister?

960
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:31,565
He has been appointed the Minister of Agriculture, Yusuke Satomi,

961
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:34,026
Acting Prime Minister.

962
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:38,030
He will lead a provisional government emergency

963
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:40,574
and must form a new cabinet

964
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:43,160
to fill the political vacuum.

965
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:46,246
So a man with seniority in the government

966
01:10:46,497 --> 01:10:50,375
and whose loyalty led him to become a minister,

967
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:52,628
It is now the Prime Minister.

968
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,340
I heard that the party secretary has imposed charge.

969
01:10:56,548 --> 01:11:00,177
Who wants to take responsibility at this time?

970
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:03,889
There are worrying movements on the island of Tsushima.

971
01:11:04,097 --> 01:11:07,726
I guess we will have to wait and see.

972
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:10,145
You can act the Foreign Ministry?

973
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,898
We remain functional.

974
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,444
In any case, try to avoid unexpected surprises.

975
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:21,240
It shall inform the Ambassador.

976
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:31,250
These noodles are gone.

977
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:37,422
I knew this job would not be easy.

978
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:41,426
Satomi is a difficult man to understand.

979
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:45,389
Anyway, our mission is to keep the ship afloat.

980
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:47,724
We need emergency legislation.

981
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:51,937
We are just 30 km from where he sleeps Godzilla.

982
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:55,232
That has already stopped worrying.

983
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:59,319
In this country we are experts in choosing successors to hurry.

984
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:02,030
- Will you be next? - No way.

985
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:06,785
Maybe in ten years.

986
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:10,247
If Japan continues to exist, could you introduce yourself to the elections.

987
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:14,793
I would support changing the position of party secretary.

988
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:21,091
Akasaka was in Yokota, so is saved.

989
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:25,512
A politician needs strategy and luck.

990
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:28,932
Now is the new Secretary of the Cabinet.

991
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:32,394
You could be more ambitious.

992
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:38,775
Although the Agency Catastrophe is a unique destination.

993
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:41,570
And you're pretty much in charge.

994
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:44,531
No, I'm here to take on the responsibilities, if necessary.

995
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:47,326
Akasaka is very skilled devolving.

996
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:50,204
You are the new advisor to the Prime Minister.

997
01:12:50,454 --> 01:12:54,124
- You're released in your political career. - And what's wrong with that'?

998
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:57,794
Why did you become a politician?

999
01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:01,673
This is all white or black. And that simplicity I like.

1000
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,760
They are members of the Agency arrived.

1001
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:10,724
I'm glad to see you all.

1002
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:13,727
More than half of our team is back.

1003
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,062
Thank you.

1004
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:20,317
Our heart is full of sorrow for those we have lost.

1005
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,277
We have to do it for them!

1006
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,489
Cover your positions ...

1007
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,616
while we suffer ...

1008
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:30,035
for the loss of our colleagues and loved ones.

1009
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,704
We can get ahead!

1010
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,542
For our compatriots.

1011
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,505
I ask you to give yourselves body and soul to finish our work.

1012
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:42,923
I beg.

1013
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:54,101
- All work! - To the order.

1014
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:05,571
I died. - Yes?

1015
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,072
And the plan to freeze?

1016
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:12,244
Several laboratories are working on 24 procoagulant blood

1017
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:14,997
silicon-based, thrombin and others.

1018
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:18,625
- Someone should work. - What signs?

1019
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:22,629
We have asked alive Self-Defense Forces cells.

1020
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:27,926
It is understood.

1021
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,596
We have samples.

1022
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:33,474
I will send them to laboratories BSL4.

1023
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:34,433
Very good.

1024
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:38,729
What do we tell the public and private laboratories?

1025
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:41,523
Substances that are high government secrecy.

1026
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:44,234
We need information about Godzilla.

1027
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:50,491
No change in the radiation level. Still below a Sievert.

1028
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,034
It has a very deep sleep.

1029
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:54,328
It is storing everything in your gut.

1030
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:56,914
Shift change.

1031
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:01,335
Aquí Yaguchi.

1032
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:05,881
Be there in five minutes. Prepare a meeting with the Prime Minister.

1033
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:10,093
Do you want to provide something that could help us in our struggle?

1034
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:11,261
That's right?

1035
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:15,557
Yes. There is a movement, mainly in China and Russia,

1036
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:18,644
to remove Godzilla Japanese government control

1037
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:21,688
and put it under the control of international organizations.

1038
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,691
Many countries have aligned themselves with that view.

1039
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,570
However, with respect to this government,

1040
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:33,200
We hope that Japan and the US Godzilla can control successfully.

1041
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:34,952
Good.

1042
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,163
From the point of view of the government,

1043
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:42,000
There is no doubt that you would access your collaboration offer.

1044
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:47,881
However, to meet a functioning government,

1045
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,926
we must respect the lines of action

1046
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,845
marked by the previous government.

1047
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,930
In view of this,

1048
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,015
We accept.

1049
01:15:57,307 --> 01:16:00,394
A US coalition. UU. - Japan to investigate Godzilla?

1050
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:04,565
The more knowledge, the better. Let's make room.

1051
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,192
Encantado. Soy Rando Yaguchi.

1052
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:13,365
Images of surveillance unmanned Self-Defense Forces.

1053
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,913
the connection shortly after the attack was lost.

1054
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:22,207
It was the same with the D2 simulator.

1055
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:24,084
Just what I feared.

1056
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:27,880
It seems that Godzilla has a built-in radar waves his face.

1057
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:30,841
So you can intercept instinctively

1058
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,885
all objects approaching him.

1059
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:39,224
Unit 2, here CV - 1. 5 minutes are ground zero.

1060
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,643
They are 10 minutes. Change.

1061
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:43,854
Received, CV-1.

1062
01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:54,823
I am comparing field data with Tsukuba.

1063
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:58,035
This could be the way Godzilla plans to spread.

1064
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:03,332
Rapid colonization worldwide.

1065
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:08,253
You can not only develop and adopt a smaller,

1066
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:10,714
could develop wings and fly across the ocean.

1067
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:13,592
Let's move on.

1068
01:17:15,886 --> 01:17:17,513
And it would be the end of the human race.

1069
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:18,722
Before that,

1070
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:23,352
nuclear technology is the only thing that can save mankind.

1071
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:24,895
Are you serious?

1072
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:30,359
Defense Secretary believes the best is ...

1073
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:34,279
Godzilla attacking a thermonuclear beam.

1074
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,533
And in the White House?

1075
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:40,202
There is a report that cites a 13% chance

1076
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:42,246
that Godzilla lands on the West Coast.

1077
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:44,665
The Security Council UN

1078
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:48,126
He has organized a multinational force assault against Godzilla.

1079
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:50,295
United States is serious.

1080
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:53,382
I'm afraid so.

1081
01:17:55,592 --> 01:18:00,472
They say you have to attack Godzilla with a nuclear missile.

1082
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:07,062
The Pentagon has approved a nuclear warhead maximum range B83.

1083
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:14,528
- For release on Tokyo? - I have been ordered to evacuate.

1084
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,448
I get it.

1085
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:21,785
So it's very likely.

1086
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:24,913
YES.

1087
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:30,544
But I will not go back.

1088
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,757
I do not want to see a third bomb ...

1089
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:41,847
fall on the country of my grandmother, who had to suffer the other two.

1090
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:50,856
Mr President, count on it. Do not worry.

1091
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:57,237
Definitely. We act accordingly, President Ross.

1092
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:06,497
Well, you've heard.

1093
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:11,376
That country we always imposes all sorts of crazy.

1094
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,837
That's clear.

1095
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:18,425
But this is going too far!

1096
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:20,427
I agree.

1097
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:23,639
- Call the Secretary of the Cabinet. - Yes.

1098
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:31,104
The Security Council UN has adopted a resolution

1099
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:36,401
for a US force exterminate Godzilla.

1100
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:42,366
As part of the resolution,

1101
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,954
our nation will be under his command.

1102
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,332
In other words,

1103
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,044
I need a special law

1104
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:57,047
granting full powers to the Prime Minister.

1105
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:07,516
To authorize ...

1106
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:11,228
... the use of nuclear weapons on Tokyo?

1107
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:34,126
I did not want to go down in history for something.

1108
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:46,096
It will become UN jurisdiction, depending US

1109
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,686
The postwar Japan is a subsidiary state.

1110
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:56,857
The war seems to last forever.

1111
01:20:57,691 --> 01:20:59,276
But we must not surrender.

1112
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,866
No creature can withstand

1113
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:09,244
a million degrees generated by a nuclear missile.

1114
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:14,625
A safe method of extermination. It is the right decision.

1115
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:20,339
We are very close to take a big step with the freezing method.

1116
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,259
Your method still too many unknowns.

1117
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:28,263
Furthermore, all countries have committed to support

1118
01:21:28,514 --> 01:21:32,059
with a full program of reconstruction if we sign.

1119
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:35,687
If we do not destroy Godzilla, certainly,

1120
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:38,607
We lose confidence worldwide.

1121
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:41,985
We must put our fate in the hands of the UN.

1122
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:47,115
My duty is to think about what to do for Japan

1123
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,452
Once Godzilla has been annihilated.

1124
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:54,832
Right now, the damage is limited to three districts.

1125
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:56,792
We can rebuild.

1126
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:59,378
The city economy is in freefall.

1127
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:02,840
If bonds and stocks are plummeting,

1128
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:05,676
the nation will enter bankruptcy.

1129
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:10,514
Japan needs international support and funding.

1130
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:14,518
Raze and rebuild, is not it?

1131
01:22:15,394 --> 01:22:16,728
To save the country.

1132
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,150
There is no other solution.

1133
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:24,778
Yaguchi.

1134
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:29,366
This is the reality. Everything else is nothing but a dream.

1135
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:33,412
What? ¿Una thermonuclear bomb?

1136
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:35,038
Over the city?

1137
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:38,041
Just we give our approval to the UN.

1138
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,668
Amazing.

1139
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:43,714
And how do we know that it has not become immortal?

1140
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:49,344
There are two options: cremate a nuclear missile or freeze.

1141
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:54,391
Yes, those are the options. But none is good.

1142
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,603
Man gives me scarier than Godzilla.

1143
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:02,608
The UN will give us time for evacuation work.

1144
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:04,860
We will use that time to finish.

1145
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:09,490
There is something that has worked well with the samples.

1146
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:10,824
It only remains to produce it.

1147
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:12,951
To freeze all his blood

1148
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:16,121
672 kiloliters need coagulant.

1149
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,540
I am in contact with the laboratories.

1150
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:21,335
- Can we get it? - We must get it as!

1151
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:25,964
Do not be rindáis. We can not abandon this country.

1152
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:28,759
Ask all chemical companies that know

1153
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,887
to open all possible lines of production.

1154
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:34,223
I will send all necessary data.

1155
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:38,435
Tell all finished production we need for tomorrow.

1156
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:41,313
We received extensive comparative information.

1157
01:23:41,522 --> 01:23:43,398
Knowledge works.

1158
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,122
Police and the Ministry of Infrastructure should organize

1159
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:00,624
el del transport coagulant.

1160
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:01,917
I'll do it.

1161
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,878
The Ministry of Economy coordinates the production of bombs.

1162
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,799
If we commit to buy them,

1163
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,009
Shanghai will give us three tankers.

1164
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:14,346
We need five trucks the size it.

1165
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:21,019
Ambassador Lansing

1166
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:25,482
has just informed us that according to forecasts by the coalition,

1167
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,526
Godzilla energy beam

1168
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,571
will regain its previous levels in less than 360 hours.

1169
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:37,035
Chances are that the creature resume its activity in 15 days.

1170
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,246
It is understood.

1171
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:44,418
Attention all non-essential personnel should evacuate the building.

1172
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:47,588
It has approved the nuclear attack on Godzilla.

1173
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:49,298
The countdown will begin in 5 minutes.

1174
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,759
So there is no turning back.

1175
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:56,013
Japan will have a grace period of two weeks

1176
01:24:56,263 --> 01:24:58,307
to evacuate the remaining residents.

1177
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:01,143
It may seem a lot for the Allied forces,

1178
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,645
but very little for Japan.

1179
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:10,736
An evacuation means pluck people from their homes.

1180
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:15,240
Not say it as if it were that easy.

1181
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:16,742
I agree.

1182
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:19,828
Evacuate to 3.6 million people? It's stupid!

1183
01:25:20,037 --> 01:25:22,080
We do not have sufficient means.

1184
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:25,709
Not counting the millions of surrounding districts.

1185
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:28,462
Governor complains about the sacrifice of Tokyo.

1186
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:31,673
A national decision, not local.

1187
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:36,303
Relocation can not be completed within two weeks.

1188
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,847
As Godzilla resumes its activity,

1189
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:42,059
the date of the attack will be brought forward unconditionally,

1190
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:44,353
regardless of collateral damage.

1191
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:49,233
At that moment it will launch a thermonuclear warhead from a submarine

1192
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:51,568
by decision of the Coalition.

1193
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:56,323
Woe! How easy it is to decide when it comes to the distant Asia.

1194
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:01,161
If in New York, they say that would act the same.

1195
01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:42,369
Land prices shooting in the west of the country and food is scarce.

1196
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,747
Businesses and shops are closed Kanto.

1197
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:47,791
The city is full of unemployed.

1198
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:52,254
The collapse of the yen reflects investor fear.

1199
01:26:52,963 --> 01:26:55,299
Less benefiting from it.

1200
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,844
There are people of all kinds.

1201
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:03,390
- Do you have information? - I got it.

1202
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:05,726
At the end of the day, it's my job.

1203
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:11,148
What if my article published a day before they throw the bomb?

1204
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:16,320
Here's the new material Godzilla.

1205
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:20,616
In return, we can control the timing of the announcement.

1206
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:24,912
- What do you think? - It is understood.

1207
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:33,712
Professor abhorred radiation sickness

1208
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:36,006
that the life of his wife was.

1209
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:40,844
He expected to be harmless radioactive materials.

1210
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,473
If something like this was possible,

1211
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:47,059
so would the creation of new materials.

1212
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:49,770
Certainly feared the military.

1213
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:53,065
Why hide data from the Department of Energy.

1214
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:56,985
Hated radioactive materials

1215
01:27:57,694 --> 01:28:00,948
and all those who had any relationship with them.

1216
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:06,286
Including Japan, who left his wife to die.

1217
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:10,874
And then let your data and writes "Do what you want '?

1218
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,835
What a strange person!

1219
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,798
And what did he do in the end?

1220
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:29,434
How good it was!

1221
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,273
Have you already solved the graph?

1222
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:37,985
I get nothing or with the help of a cryptographer.

1223
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:39,820
Any word US?

1224
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:43,073
I would not trust a lot of them, right now.

1225
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:47,953
It is important for a multilevel approach.

1226
01:28:48,162 --> 01:28:51,623
More than a chemical scheme looks like a mandala.

1227
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:55,460
0 perhaps is made backward from the solution.

1228
01:28:55,711 --> 01:28:57,796
The man was a bit twisted.

1229
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:01,800
Even simple lines mystify me.

1230
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:05,012
Why not put on paper and in electronic form?

1231
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:08,932
Perhaps it is designed to bend.

1232
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:14,521
With a body like Godzilla,

1233
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:18,650
old radioactive debris should leave hungry.

1234
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:19,818
Definitely.

1235
01:29:20,486 --> 01:29:22,946
Customers have crooked.

1236
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:26,116
With them you can not grasp nuclear waste.

1237
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:33,123
Origami.

1238
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:38,795
They are not eating.

1239
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:41,715
We have captured the whole pattern,

1240
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:44,843
The new information comes from the folds.

1241
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:47,596
We focus on radiation fa as its energy source.

1242
01:29:47,805 --> 01:29:52,100
This is a molecular graph of the conversion elements in your body.

1243
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:54,645
They are molecules Convertion elements.

1244
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:58,857
The unknown radioactive isotope is tested.

1245
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:02,236
If hydrogen or nitrogen enters the cell,

1246
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:04,488
there becomes necessary molecules.

1247
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:09,660
It is a mixotrophic with an organ that synthesizes heat decomposition.

1248
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:11,912
A bold but feasible hypothesis.

1249
01:30:14,164 --> 01:30:16,834
You can live where there is water and oxygen,

1250
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:19,086
as an ascetic who survives in the mist.

1251
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:22,673
So Godzilla is a threat to humanity,

1252
01:30:22,965 --> 01:30:26,844
but it is also a finding of unlimited potential.

1253
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:31,765
But the blood coagulant may not be effective in your body and that

1254
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:35,227
- end the Yaguchi Plan. - It's possible. And so?

1255
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:37,938
We need to make it work.

1256
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:41,984
First we analyze its structure and then how to evade it.

1257
01:30:42,192 --> 01:30:45,320
I have several supercomputers running parallel analyzes,

1258
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:47,823
but missing days to get the results.

1259
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,284
We only have ten days.

1260
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:53,912
The Ministry of Science is asking for international aid.

1261
01:30:55,038 --> 01:30:56,498
They have called for Japan.

1262
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:59,877
We apply a parallel computer analysis.

1263
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:01,587
We can not!

1264
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:05,674
Our system is closed.

1265
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,635
We can not risk that we steal data.

1266
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:10,804
Come on.

1267
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:14,224
Do not you trust your neighbor?

1268
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:18,979
Tell them it will be a pleasure to do that analysis.

1269
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:32,910
We have solved the riddle of Maki!

1270
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:42,836
- Here. - Is incredible.

1271
01:31:43,504 --> 01:31:46,048
Not the cell membrane itself,

1272
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:48,467
but a configuration extremophile

1273
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:50,886
which inhibits the activity of the cell membrane.

1274
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:57,559
This inhibitor could cause the blood coagulant viable.

1275
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:59,186
There's still hope.

1276
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:02,397
It looks good.

1277
01:32:05,234 --> 01:32:06,401
Good!

1278
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,866
I have the feeling that Goro Maki already anticipated this.

1279
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:18,121
You may liberate this destructive god

1280
01:32:19,248 --> 01:32:22,543
as a kind of test for humanity,

1281
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:26,964
for this country, for the Japanese.

1282
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:30,592
"Do what you want '

1283
01:32:32,136 --> 01:32:34,096
including the use of nuclear weapons.

1284
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:38,433
Can be.

1285
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,187
" That's difficult in this country.

1286
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:45,274
YES.

1287
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:48,193
And more on your own.

1288
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:53,323
Lord, we are putting the final touches of Yaguchi Plan.

1289
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:56,535
We request your approval to start it.

1290
01:32:56,952 --> 01:32:58,662
Already. But Izumi ...

1291
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:02,499
The UN resolution has already been approved.

1292
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,670
Some say that the US seeking a quick resolution

1293
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,881
to hide what they know about Godzilla.

1294
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:11,300
We already know.

1295
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:14,887
And you know what state the country is.

1296
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:16,388
But sir ...

1297
01:33:16,597 --> 01:33:20,726
force a country to sacrifice for its own sake is deplorable.

1298
01:33:23,228 --> 01:33:24,521
Then, he hints ...

1299
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:28,775
to act unilaterally on humanitarian issues.

1300
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:33,322
Maybe it's time to do what we want.

1301
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:36,200
He is right.

1302
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:40,537
So where do I have to sign?

1303
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:48,045
"Strategy to deliver a coagulant to freeze

1304
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:50,297
the creature still. "

1305
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,424
It's a little long.

1306
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:55,803
And how do we call it?

1307
01:33:56,220 --> 01:34:00,724
In honor sake I used to sleep hydra: Operation Yashiori.

1308
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:04,812
Very good. The 5 phases to execute.

1309
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,064
Asaka is finalizing the details.

1310
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,318
Already it is taken the test vehicles

1311
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:13,445
and mock explosives.

1312
01:34:13,654 --> 01:34:15,322
We are ready for execution.

1313
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:17,908
Thank you very much.

1314
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:21,203
You're welcome. It's our job.

1315
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,590
There are only two days.

1316
01:34:36,385 --> 01:34:37,219
Dammit!

1317
01:34:37,427 --> 01:34:40,764
We need three days to produce sufficient coagulant.

1318
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:43,100
Would not you can stop the countdown?

1319
01:34:43,308 --> 01:34:47,020
Who can we call the Security Council to postpone?

1320
01:34:47,229 --> 01:34:50,482
Neither China nor Russia for geopolitical proximity.

1321
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:55,946
And France? It is a nuclear country and interest them biological data.

1322
01:34:56,155 --> 01:34:58,532
I have a secret contact. I will try to use it.

1323
01:34:58,782 --> 01:34:59,533
Yes please.

1324
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,618
I'll call the President of Parliament.

1325
01:35:01,827 --> 01:35:04,037
I'll call the Foreign Minister.

1326
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:07,124
We need 24 hours!

1327
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:10,419
France has requested stop the countdown.

1328
01:35:10,669 --> 01:35:15,966
China and Russia oppose, but we keep silence.

1329
01:35:16,675 --> 01:35:21,597
There are not only supporters of the hardliners in Washington and the Pentagon.

1330
01:35:23,265 --> 01:35:24,933
Japan has grown enough

1331
01:35:25,142 --> 01:35:28,020
to have international trade agreements at all levels.

1332
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:32,733
The danger may be an opportunity for personal growth.

1333
01:35:36,695 --> 01:35:40,699
Our friends are about to finalize the plan freezing.

1334
01:35:42,826 --> 01:35:45,287
I think this country wants to bet on that.

1335
01:35:45,787 --> 01:35:48,499
And you're up that bet, so I see.

1336
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,503
Nuclear weapons are a deterrent resource.

1337
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:57,382
I tried to advise Charles to not use, but ...

1338
01:35:57,925 --> 01:36:00,385
That goes against the majority opinion.

1339
01:36:01,428 --> 01:36:05,015
And you and I have to bear the risk of revenge.

1340
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,892
I really nothing will happen,

1341
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:12,940
But you, with your controversial opinions and surname Patterson ...

1342
01:36:13,816 --> 01:36:15,234
you'll splash.

1343
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:21,198
And your dream of being President with 40 years vanish.

1344
01:36:38,132 --> 01:36:39,383
¡ Kayoko!

1345
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:42,594
Good luck.

1346
01:36:44,138 --> 01:36:44,721
YES.

1347
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:49,685
- A joint strategy with the United States? - There would be more likely to succeed.

1348
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:52,980
And can we coordinate our independent controls?

1349
01:36:53,397 --> 01:36:55,399
You have made many friends.

1350
01:36:55,607 --> 01:36:58,360
Volunteers'd Air Force and Marines.

1351
01:36:58,569 --> 01:37:02,239
Even if you need drones. What do you say?

1352
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:05,367
I'm in. But I can not guarantee anything.

1353
01:37:05,576 --> 01:37:07,786
- I do not know if we will return in one piece. - Of course.

1354
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:09,621
I'll be all the time with you.

1355
01:37:18,589 --> 01:37:21,508
We have achieved enough inhibitors.

1356
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,678
immediately send trucks.

1357
01:37:27,723 --> 01:37:31,768
Coagulant material and are ready for transport.

1358
01:37:32,019 --> 01:37:33,479
They have a green light.

1359
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:39,193
Are you sure you want to accompany the troops on the front?

1360
01:37:39,401 --> 01:37:42,529
Perhaps we should take a political decision on the fly

1361
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:45,782
- and there will be time to consult. - It's too risky.

1362
01:37:46,033 --> 01:37:47,743
It can be directed from the rear.

1363
01:37:48,202 --> 01:37:49,953
You want to be Prime Minister in ten years?

1364
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:54,166
First we must ensure that the country exists within ten years.

1365
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:59,171
We have young talent, public and private. Like you.

1366
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:00,923
We leaders.

1367
01:38:06,845 --> 01:38:09,139
You have encouraged me to follow. Thank you.

1368
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:11,892
Silly stuff. He gives thanks to Akasaka for their support.

1369
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,352
Good luck.

1370
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:16,688
You reserve me the post of party secretary.

1371
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:37,376
In this operation Yashiori ...

1372
01:38:40,712 --> 01:38:42,506
there is a high risk ...

1373
01:38:43,132 --> 01:38:45,342
prolonged exposure to radioactive heat!

1374
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:52,724
I can not promise that all will be safe!

1375
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:57,020
But your work itself will be important!

1376
01:39:02,192 --> 01:39:05,445
The greatest strength of our country lies in its men!

1377
01:39:08,407 --> 01:39:11,869
Self-Defense Forces are the last stronghold ...

1378
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:13,287
... able to protect this country!

1379
01:39:20,878 --> 01:39:24,590
The future of Japan is in your hands!

1380
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:28,677
Good luck!

1381
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:33,015
- Marchen. - Yes.

1382
01:39:39,646 --> 01:39:41,482
We wind northwest, two meters.

1383
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:44,234
The radioactive cloud would dissipate in the bay,

1384
01:39:44,526 --> 01:39:47,488
- the impact would be minimized.
- All platoons prepared.

1385
01:39:47,696 --> 01:39:50,157
US drone attack squad

1386
01:39:50,407 --> 01:39:52,493
It is expected designated positions.

1387
01:39:52,868 --> 01:39:55,329
Lord, all systems in order.

1388
01:39:55,954 --> 01:39:58,832
Tokyo will confirm if evacuation is complete.

1389
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:01,835
Just have a chance, so let's go.

1390
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:05,798
Ordered local authorities to give the curfew.

1391
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:09,092
Understood, sir. Reminded the aldermen Kanto area.

1392
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:14,056
Do not leave home any citizen in the next 50 hours.

1393
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:15,182
To the order.

1394
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:19,812
The railway detachment is going through zero.

1395
01:40:20,062 --> 01:40:21,939
the Yashiori operation begins.

1396
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:24,399
Phase 1! Distraction! Ahead!

1397
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,128
The distraction has been successful!

1398
01:40:44,378 --> 01:40:47,005
The train explosion has been effective! Operation, Phase 2.

1399
01:40:47,214 --> 01:40:48,590
Let start airstrike!

1400
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:50,551
To the order. Contact Air Force.

1401
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:54,096
Eagle 1 Control here. Start bombing. Change.

1402
01:40:54,304 --> 01:40:56,932
Received. First wave activated.

1403
01:41:05,732 --> 01:41:06,441
Attention!

1404
01:41:06,692 --> 01:41:09,069
The goal is launching photon beams from their dorsal fins!

1405
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:12,114
Godzilla is tearing down the drones just as planned.

1406
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:15,492
First wave torn down!

1407
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:17,202
We have to desgastarle.

1408
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:20,330
Continue bombing until exhausted.

1409
01:41:24,877 --> 01:41:26,795
Second wave of drones thrown down.

1410
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:28,881
Third wave of tugs starting attack.

1411
01:41:29,131 --> 01:41:31,091
Moving target coordinates provided.

1412
01:41:37,848 --> 01:41:39,183
Third wave, torn down!

1413
01:41:41,643 --> 01:41:43,228
The area of ​​contamination is growing.

1414
01:41:43,479 --> 01:41:46,148
Radiation exceeds the maximum allowed.

1415
01:41:46,398 --> 01:41:50,319
If we stop now, we will have lost everything. Keep up the attack!

1416
01:42:00,996 --> 01:42:02,247
Fourth wave destroyed!

1417
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:03,957
We can not give in now! Lancen the fifth wave!

1418
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:14,968
The target has stopped hurling thunderbolts from their dorsal!

1419
01:42:22,184 --> 01:42:23,560
How does he do that?

1420
01:42:30,025 --> 01:42:31,443
Fifth wave thrown down.

1421
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:36,240
He has doubled the intensity of lightning!

1422
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,868
We must endure! Lancen the sixth wave!

1423
01:42:48,585 --> 01:42:50,212
It is decreasing its volume.

1424
01:42:56,385 --> 01:42:58,178
The beam of the target has ceased!

1425
01:42:58,387 --> 01:43:00,430

1502
01:52:04,266 --> 01:52:05,976

This work comes great responsibility.

1511

A politician must decide whether to make it yours.

1512
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:44,056
And I decided to make it mine.

1513
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:50,479
Maki said:

1514
01:52:51,605 --> 01:52:53,649
"Do what you want".

1515
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:12,709
But this is not the time to leave.

1516
01:53:15,671 --> 01:53:19,299
