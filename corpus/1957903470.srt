1
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,899
Get the fuck away from me.

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,728
This is not somebody in
your piece of shit band.

3
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:33,729
What the fuck is your problem?

4
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:34,730
No.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,861
I've heard what you said.

6
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:37,733
I know about human trafficking.

7
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,039
Wait until I call
my fucking lawyer.

8
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:39,909
I'm gonna sue you for
everything you're worth.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,084
Amy?

10
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:42,520
Shannon, thank
god you're here.

11
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,783
This guy tried to
fucking kidnap me.

12
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,437
What?

13
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,699
He locked me in his car
and he wouldn't let me out.

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,136
I didn't try to kidnap her.

15
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,659
She couldn't open the door.

16
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,616
OK, well, then your
doorknob is broken.

17
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:52,965
That's on you.

18
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,837
Either way, I felt
fucking trapped.

19
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,534
I drove her two
hours from the airport.

20
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:57,840
She needs to pay cash.

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,407
Oh, we're having this
conversation again.

22
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:00,756
I told you four times.

23
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:01,887
We live in a digital economy.

24
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,499
Who the fuck carries cash?

25
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,784
Huh, the Dairy Queen closed.

26
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:55,724
Thanks again for the cab fare.

27
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:57,029
Yeah, sure.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,726
You can just pay
me back whenever.

29
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,910
Well, I wasn't
really expecting you,

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,913
but the extra guest
bedroom on the second floor

31
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,697
is free, if you want
to post up in there.

32
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:14,221
Cool.

33
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:17,746
See you like got dibs on
the bigger guest room?

34
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:20,052
I guess so.

35
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:23,404
I have been here
for a couple weeks.

36
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,101
And Pat's coming tomorrow.

37
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,972
Pat?

38
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:30,889
Yeah, Pat, my boyfriend,
for like three years.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,021
I thought you knew his name.

40
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:32,717
No.

41
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:33,283
No.

42
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:35,111
I like do.

43
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,199
I just like... I just like
wanted to make sure I knew which

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,722
Pat you were talking about.

45
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,159
Oh, coo.
Right.

46
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,464
How the fuck
do you work this?

47
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,074
So do you want to
go up and see her?

48
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,685
Who?

49
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:44,729
Nana.

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,731
You mean like...

51
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:47,863
like right now?

52
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:50,866
Did you want to do it later?

53
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,695
I kind of just got here.

54
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,436
I thought there'd be
like a gradual build.

55
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,612
I didn't know you like wanted
to whisk me in immediately.

56
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:02,965
I thought like, take a nap,
eat a Chobani, and then go in

57
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:03,313
and see her.

58
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,189
You know what?
I think we should go in now.

59
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:09,798
OK.
Cool.

60
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:24,856
God, I'm dehydrated.

61
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:32,212
So how long has
she been like this?

62
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,649
She's been unresponsive
for a couple weeks now.

63
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:42,700
I mean, I assume you
like tried to wake her up.

64
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,397
What?

65
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:44,833
Nana.

66
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,530
What are you doing?

67
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,096
Yeah, Amy.

68
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,532
Yeah.

69
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:50,969
- Yeah, we tried waking her up.
- Cool.

70
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,587
So tell me about this
library you're working at.

71
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:00,588
Oh, it's really nice.

72
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,024
Yeah.

73
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,765
We just got a
drive-in book drop.

74
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:04,983
Like a drive-in...

75
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:08,073
Yeah, like you
drive in with your car

76
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,772
and drop off your books.

77
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:14,558
That's so fucking crazy.

78
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,039
I think it's so
noble what you do.

79
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,477
It's like... almost like
taking a vow of poverty.

80
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,437
You're very saint-like.

81
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,221
Oh, I'm not a volunteer.

82
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,049
I mean, they pay me.

83
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,006
Oh, I know.

84
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:28,616
Like a stipend.

85
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:28,790
That's great.

86
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,273
So how about LA?

87
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,231
Do you... do you just love it?

88
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,014
Yeah.

89
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:36,972
Oh my god.

90
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:37,625
You'd be obsessed with it.

91
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:38,495
It's amazing.

92
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,063
Awesome.

93
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:44,936
Maybe in spring I could
come visit you sometime.

94
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:49,506
We could like go like see
the tarpits or something.

95
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:50,855
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,030
Yeah.

97
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:53,031
We'll see what's happening then.

98
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:53,989
Oh, no.

99
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,033
I mean, I don't want to impose.

100
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:55,730
No.

101
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,252
No.

102
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:56,992
No.

103
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,341
No.

104
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:01,736
It's just... it's
pilot season, so...

105
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,693
Oh, I don't know what that is.

106
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:19,144
God, it's good to see you.

107
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:22,060
I missed you.

108
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:22,713
I missed you too.

109
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,292
All right.

110
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,468
Well, I think I'm gonna
read for it and hit the hay.

111
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,556
Yeah.
Me too.

112
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,471
This jet lag is killing me.

113
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:44,039
Isn't California only a
three hour time difference?

114
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,997
Yeah.

115
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,696
But they say three hours can be
worse than 16 hours sometimes.

116
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,306
Yeah.

117
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,176
I don't really think
it works that way.

118
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,047
Yeah.
No.

119
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,875
It does.

120
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,267
I read part of an article
in Harper's about it.

121
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,965
OK.

122
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,141
Well, I think I'm gonna
go to the mall tomorrow.

123
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,751
Do you want me to
grab anything for you?

124
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,536
No.

125
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,406
Not unless they're got
something that can bring Nana

126
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:06,191
back from the brink of death.

127
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:09,369
- I'm joking, obviously.
- OK.

128
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,195
Well, goodnight.

129
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:14,374
Goodnight.

130
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,595
Hi, Dave.

131
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,467
It's your favorite client, Amy.

132
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:23,208
I'm just calling to
see if you've heard

133
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,297
anything about that audition.

134
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,474
My phone lost
reception when I went

135
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,171
to the bathroom a
few minutes ago,

136
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:36,613
but feel free to
shoot me a call back.

137
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,572
I might be a little
tied up later.

138
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,530
But I'll call you right back.

139
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,098
And yeah.

140
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,317
I hope to talk to you soon.

141
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,624
This is Amy.

142
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:48,886
Did I say that? already?

143
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:49,365
Yeah.

144
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,148
I did.

145
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,801
OK.

146
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:51,193
Bye.

147
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,337
Morning.

148
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:05,990
Hi.

149
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,605
How is she doing?

150
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:11,953
Good.

151
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,003
Do you know what
the Wi-Fi password is?

152
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:19,613
No.

153
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:31,363
What kind of meds is she on?

154
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:35,716
Dexamethasone, Protonix,
Zofran, Dilaudid.

155
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:40,851
Are any of those
like painkillers?

156
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:42,374
Who are you?

157
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,377
I'm her granddaughter,
one of them.

158
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,162
I'm just trying to make sure
she has enough medication

159
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,207
to ease her pain.

160
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,253
Well, she's very
well taken care of.

161
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,776
- Don't worry.
- OK.

162
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:53,908
OK I'm just checking.

163
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:01,045
But like if she like looks
like she's in more pain

164
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,873
and we need to like give
her more medication,

165
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:06,094
where would we find it?

166
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,791
OK.

167
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,271
Looks like you got everything
well taken care of.

168
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,968
I'll just...

169
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,150
Hey, sorry.
One sec.

170
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:26,854
36, 37, 2, 3, 4.

171
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,246
Sorry about that.

172
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:29,857
Hi.

173
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,249
I'm glad you were
counting out loud.

174
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,382
I was wondering how
many you had done.

175
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,078
OK.

176
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,950
I'm Pat.

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,690
You must be Amy.

178
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,256
Yeah.

179
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:39,083
Whoa, nice grip.

180
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,258
Ah, thanks.

181
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,737
Wait.

182
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,087
Really?

183
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,481
So you and Shannon went
down to the mall this morning?

184
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,701
She went to jam
out a few errands.

185
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,616
So I just came back here
to jam out a quick workout.

186
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:54,664
You been to that mall?

187
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:55,752
Huh?

188
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:56,753
The... the Lighthouse Mall?

189
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:57,275
Have you been there?

190
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,799
Yeah.

191
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,670
They've got this
candle store there.

192
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,238
It has literally every
different kind of candle scent

193
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,848
that you can imagine.
Oh, yeah.

194
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,415
Wax World.

195
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,460
My friend Carly used to
work there in high school.

196
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,376
They have one candle
that smells like leather.

197
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:15,816
Like you light it and your
room smells like leather.

198
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,208
Like I don't know
who'd want their room

199
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,558
to smell like that, but...

200
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,255
Well, I actually dated
this guy in Topanga who

201
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,822
was like really into leather.

202
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,171
It was actually like
a huge sticking point

203
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,564
in our relationship.

204
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:25,913
So Shannon says
you're an actor?

205
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:26,348
Mhm.

206
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,700
My show's on hiatus right now.

207
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:31,701
So...

208
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,311
Really?

209
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:33,921
So do you, like, know
any famous people?

210
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,749
Or...

211
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,012
Yeah, actually, I go to the
same podiatrist as the guy

212
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,274
who plays Freddie Krueger.

213
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:40,841
What?

214
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,712
Bob England?
I love him.

215
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:43,844
I grew up watching
all his movies.

216
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,759
When he was like, hey, bitch.

217
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,412
Hey, you bitch.

218
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,937
He does that laugh when
he flicks his tongue.

219
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,286
I don't know he does it.
I can't do it at the same time.

220
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,200
But that's fucking dope.

221
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,201
That's awesome.

222
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,555
Hi.

223
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:03,733
So Pat what are you
guys up to tonight?

224
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,562
Just like chill out,
do some Sudoku, you know,

225
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,346
maybe foam roll a little.

226
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,784
I was thinking,
what if we, like,

227
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:15,571
surprise Shannon and threw
a party here at the house?

228
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:17,007
Oh, do you think
that's such a good idea

229
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,140
with Nana and... and all or...
Oh, yeah.

230
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,794
Totally.

231
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,622
I mean, she's like kind
of in a coma anyway.

232
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,362
So it actually would
be like a good thing

233
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,321
if we're like too
loud and woke her up.

234
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,670
What about Shannon?

235
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,324
What do you mean?

236
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,326
- Shannon love surprise parties.
- Does she?

237
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:38,725
We got beer, whiskey,
vodka, and gin.

238
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,596
Bud lite Cheladas for Shannon.

239
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:41,902
She finds them refreshing.

240
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,338
- I'll take her word for it.
- Yeah.

241
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,295
Did you get Sun Chips?

242
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,470
Yeah.

243
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,385
I got Garden and French Onion.

244
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,039
Beautiful.

245
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,302
So I think all we have
left is whipped cream?

246
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,608
For what?

247
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,218
For the pie.

248
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:54,784
Oh, right.

249
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:55,655
Yeah.

250
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,830
Kidding.

251
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,570
It's for whippets, obviously.

252
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,571
It wouldn't a townie party
without a little nitrous oxide,

253
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:00,572
now would it?

254
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,663
Oh, right.

255
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:04,620
Shit.

256
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,143
What?

257
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,623
I left my wallet
back at the house.

258
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,276
No worries.

259
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:09,146
I'll get it.

260
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:10,670
You get me back.

261
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,019
Thank you.

262
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,108
Oh, I'm gonna
get a Muscle Milk.

263
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,631
- I'll meet you at the register?
- Cool.

264
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:16,240
Grab me one.

265
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,502
Just kidding.

266
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:18,460
I don't know what that is.

267
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,374
OK.

268
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:20,636
It sounds disgusting.

269
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,203
What was that?

270
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,508
Huh?

271
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,466
I'll meet you at the register.

272
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:25,075
OK.

273
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,747
Amy?

274
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:49,012
It's me, Ted, from high school.

275
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,448
Right.

276
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,450
You and Shannon were
friends in high school.

277
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,235
Didn't you used to be like fight
and have like a terrible bowl

278
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,671
cut?

279
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:56,672
Yes, big diet...
big weight problem.

280
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,500
Yeah.

281
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,721
- But you're like hot now.
- Thanks, yeah.

282
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:02,939
I mean, you look good too.

283
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,550
Cool leather jacket.

284
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,290
So what's up?

285
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:06,987
Good.

286
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,902
I'm doing good.

287
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:12,122
I'm stilling living in town,
working over at Guitar Center.

288
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,036
So that's pretty sweet.

289
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,734
And yeah.

290
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:15,735
That's about it.

291
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:16,518
What are you doing here?

292
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:17,737
Why are you in town?

293
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,000
My grandma is dying actually.

294
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,436
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,090
Thank you so much
for your sympathy.

296
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,309
It's actually been like a
good reminder, you know,

297
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,876
that we're all like
headed towards the grave.

298
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,270
I mean, like some of us
much faster than others,

299
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,489
but, you know, we're all
gonna kick the bucket someday.

300
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,535
So we have to, you know, like
seize the day and whatnot.

301
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,318
Yeah.
Yeah.

302
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,711
For sure.
Totally.

303
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,408
- So is Shannon in town too?
- Yeah.

304
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,106
Yeah.
We're both here.

305
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:39,541
Very cool.

306
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,455
Very cool.

307
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,065
That's cool.
Yeah.

308
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,546
Well, if you guys are
in town for a while,

309
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,591
we should all get together,
hang out or something.

310
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,245
Actually what are
you up to tonight?

311
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:54,991
Whoo.

312
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,520
How much Tequila
did you put in this?

313
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,261
All of it.

314
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,220
It's really good.

315
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,613
Tell you what, we got to kick
this fucking party up a notch.

316
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,964
Cause like whatever the energy
level is when people get here,

317
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,443
it's gonna set the tone
for the entire thing.

318
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,069
Shannon.

319
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,375
Whoo.

320
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,986
Check me out.

321
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,031
I drank a whole fucking
Budweiser by myself.

322
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,772
Amy, what in the heck?

323
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,948
I go to Panera for like
one second and I come back

324
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,515
and there's all these
strangers in our house.

325
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,473
We're throwing a party
we wanted to surprise you.

326
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,431
Well, congratulations.

327
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,736
- I'm surprised.
- Good.

328
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:45,999
Did you there's
tether ball outside.

329
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:46,826
What?
No.

330
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,828
It was Pat's idea.

331
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,872
OK.
Great.

332
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,439
You know I love tether ball.

333
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,353
But like, what made you
think that you could

334
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,180
have all these people here?

335
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,224
Nana's dying upstairs.

336
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,531
Shannon, relax.

337
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,446
Everything's under control.

338
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,013
This is my thing.

339
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,231
You know how you're really
good at shelving books

340
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,580
and having asthma attacks?

341
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,365
I'm really good at
throwing parties.

342
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:05,366
You could've asked me first.

343
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,195
You would've said no.

344
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,327
Come on.

345
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,374
Let's just grab a couple
of Bud Light Cheladas

346
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,812
and kick back and relax.

347
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:17,378
Bud Light Cheladas?

348
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:17,987
Uh huh.

349
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,599
You have Cheladas?

350
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,298
Yeah, we got a whole
six pack for you.

351
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,474
- They're very refreshing.
- OK.

352
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,261
OK.
Fine.

353
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,610
But no one is allowed upstairs.

354
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,438
Of course.

355
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,526
Where did you say
those Cheladas were?

356
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:38,834
Stop saying Cheladas.

357
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:39,791
Um.

358
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,229
So Hollywood, huh?

359
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,622
It must be pretty cool to
live out in Cali, right?

360
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,102
I mean, nobody
really calls it Cali.

361
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,321
But yeah, it's pretty tight.

362
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:47,843
Cool.
Cool.

363
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,845
Yeah.

364
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,021
I went on a business trip
out there a few years ago.

365
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,545
I stayed at the Marriott
out on Long Beach.

366
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,895
Oh, yeah.

367
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,897
- You been to long Beach?
- Yeah.

368
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,464
I had a panic attack at the
Jamba Juice there last year.

369
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:01,030
Of course.

370
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:01,552
Right.

371
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:02,727
Yeah.

372
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:05,513
So you're... you're an actress.

373
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:08,777
Have you been in anything
I've heard of or...

374
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,387
Yeah.

375
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,519
I actually just shot
an episode of "Where

376
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,129
to Sin in Brentwood Park."

377
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,653
That's the soap opera, right?

378
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,655
- Daytime sitcom, but yeah.
- Sure.

379
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,701
But anymore,
really, everyone knows

380
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:20,963
that's where like the
most interesting writing

381
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,052
on television is happening.

382
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:25,315
The Times did an in-depth
review of our episode.

383
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,795
And they said it was the
most scintillating one

384
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,231
of the season.
That's great.

385
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,581
The New York Times
wrote about your work?

386
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,061
I mean, it was the
Soap Opera Times,

387
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,281
but really anymore,
everyone knows that's, like,

388
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,630
where the most, like,
interesting writing

389
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,806
about television is happening.

390
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,546
Totally.

391
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,117
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

392
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,248
You can't go up there.

393
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:45,945
My grandma's dying up there.

394
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,210
Sorry.

395
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,950
Thank you.

396
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,559
Sorry.

397
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,345
Hey, babe?

398
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,738
Yeah?

399
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,131
Can you take this box
into the other room?

400
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,480
Yeah.

401
00:15:59,610 --> 00:15:59,654
There's some
heirlooms in here.

402
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,318
Hey, can I take all
the food out of the fridge?

403
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,928
I got to put my beer somewhere.

404
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:13,668
Oh my god.

405
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:14,669
Ted.

406
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,062
Hey.

407
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,672
Hi.

408
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,500
- Hi.
- Yeah.

409
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,675
I heard you guys were having
a little soiree tonight.

410
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,417
- So I thought I'd stop by.
- Yeah.

411
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,461
Hi.

412
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:25,767
What are you doing...

413
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:26,898
I saw your sister
at the grocery store,

414
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,204
said you guys were in town.
So...

415
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,466
Oh, yeah.

416
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,511
Our grandma's dying.

417
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:31,338
Yeah, that's what Amy said.

418
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,730
I'm Sorry.

419
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,645
It's OK.

420
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,082
It's not really OK.

421
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,474
Yeah.

422
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,215
This is nuts.

423
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:40,738
Yeah.

424
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:43,219
Yeah.

425
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,311
We're just having a pretty
dope party here, just...

426
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,183
it's probably gonna be
like kind of crazy later.

427
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:53,360
So I just want to like get some
of this, like, lame shit outta

428
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,230
here.

429
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:55,057
Yeah.

430
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:55,971
What... what's that?

431
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,452
What are you holding?

432
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:01,020
It's a giraffe salt
and pepper shaker.

433
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:06,068
Are you fucking serious?

434
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,768
You had a Sega Dreamcast
this entire time

435
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,163
and you didn't think to tell me?

436
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,208
Pat, this is Ted.

437
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,470
Hey, Ted.

438
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,645
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

439
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:18,994
How are you?

440
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,170
- Ted, I've heard a lot about you.
- Really?

441
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,435
Maybe not.

442
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:26,132
All right.

443
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,568
Cool.

444
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:28,569
I see you're packing
some heat there.

445
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,397
- What?
- Oh, the beer?

446
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,833
Yeah.
Yeah.

447
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:35,228
What do you say we
shotgun run the bad boys?

448
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:36,229
Yeah.

449
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:36,925
OK.
Sure.

450
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,795
Yeah.

451
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,059
Great.

452
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:43,062
So what I wanted to do, dude,
is take the beer can and sort

453
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:47,805
of hold it canted at 45 degrees,
take a number two pencil,

454
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:48,676
and then...

455
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,504
and then... whoa.

456
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:51,548
Wasn't ready for it, but OK.

457
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,419
Here we go.

458
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,594
OK.

459
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:54,247
And then... And then sort of...

460
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,993
I love how the bubbles...

461
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,126
cover your dome.

462
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:04,735
Looks like you've got a lot
more left in there though, bud.

463
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,346
Yeah.

464
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,478
But it's mostly...
yeah it's mostly foam.

465
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:09,914
It's like getting
espresso, you don't

466
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,568
want to drink the bottom of it.

467
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,743
So yeah, they brought
him in this week.

468
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,136
And you know, he seems nice.

469
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,138
He's got... he's
got a nice family.

470
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:17,444
So it's kind of nice for him.

471
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,185
We're sisters.

472
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,795
Oh, cool.

473
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,450
Guess which one
of us is younger?

474
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,409
Ooh.

475
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,018
Really?

476
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,237
Yeah.

477
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,630
OK.

478
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,849
You?

479
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,850
Wow.

480
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:33,895
Thanks.

481
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:34,765
It was you?

482
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,463
- Was I wrong?
- No.

483
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:37,768
But you don't have to be
such a fucking dick about it.

484
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,947
So yeah, the point is they're...

485
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,949
they're phasing out my job.
Whatever.

486
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,778
It's gonna be rough, but...

487
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,085
it's gonna be a challenge.

488
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,261
So how long have you and
Shannon been going out?

489
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:55,612
About three years.

490
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,310
Yeah.

491
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,963
It sounds funny saying
that out loud, three years.

492
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,052
It's like almost the amount
of time between two Olympics.

493
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,576
Yeah.

494
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:03,577
Actually, the first
time we hooked up

495
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,753
was during the summer Olympics.

496
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,929
Yeah, basketball.

497
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:08,756
No.

498
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:09,757
Rhythmic gymnastics.

499
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,890
Basketball's the winter.

500
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,544
So you guys are pretty
serious then, right?

501
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,111
Oh, yeah.

502
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:16,677
We try and watch as many
medal rounds as we can.

503
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,331
No.

504
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,159
- I mean like, relationship-wise.
- Oh, yeah.

505
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,466
I mean, can you keep a secret?

506
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:24,293
Yeah.

507
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,426
Thank god.

508
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:29,298
- I think she's the one.
- Oh.

509
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,734
OK.

510
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:45,923
Here.

511
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:46,750
Drink this.

512
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,872
Can you feel the
energy in your hands?

513
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,613
I think so.

514
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:07,309
I mean, I think the blue one
might be doing something.

515
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,831
I'm not sure what the...

516
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:12,662
whoa, whoa, whoa.

517
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:13,402
No, no, no.

518
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,577
It's OK.
It's OK.

519
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,057
She's DNR.

520
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,450
What's DNR?

521
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,278
Do not... it's not interesting.

522
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,110
There you go.

523
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,111
There you go, sweetie.

524
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,765
Get all those Cheladas out.

525
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,899
I feel like I'm throwing
up at Red Lobster.

526
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,987
Red Lobster?

527
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,075
Yeah.

528
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,469
OK.
That's cool.

529
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,042
Morning.

530
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,655
A little hungover, are we?

531
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:51,397
I feel like I'm dying.

532
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,096
Do you know what kind
of coffee this is?

533
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:55,792
I don't know.

534
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,054
Coffee coffee.

535
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,012
Yeah.

536
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,057
But is it like single origin?

537
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,495
Do you know what
country it's from?

538
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,583
Is it even organic?

539
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:04,540
I don't know.

540
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:05,498
- Look at the can.
- Ugh.

541
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,500
It's from a can?

542
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,588
Knock, knock.

543
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:09,763
Whoa.

544
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,025
Hey, can we fucking help you?

545
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:14,855
Amy, whoa, this is Pastor Wes.

546
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,292
He lives down the street.

547
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:18,162
Hey.

548
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,076
Sorry about that.

549
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,382
That's all right.

550
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,036
Wes, this is my
older sister Amy.

551
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,777
Barely older, but yeah.

552
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,344
Amy, it's so nice to meet you.

553
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,910
And for a second there I
thought I was under attack.

554
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,695
I came in and the
immediate cursing.

555
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:29,522
Yeah.

556
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,132
Sorry about that.

557
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:32,829
I guess I'm just, you
know, used to people

558
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,311
asking permission before
they barge into my space.

559
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,141
Amy, Wes has been a huge
help in taking care of Nana.

560
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,664
You really, really don't
have to say that, but yeah.

561
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,274
I have.

562
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,798
I come by the neighborhood
to kind of swing

563
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,148
by people places who are a
little more advanced in age.

564
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:51,413
It's part of my
calling, I guess.

565
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:52,980
Sounds very fulfilling.

566
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,722
It is.

567
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,854
Now, Amy, you live
in Los Angeles?

568
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:58,942
Shannon was telling
me that, right?

569
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,727
Yeah.

570
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,599
Los Feliz, well, actually
South Glendale, but everyone

571
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,384
knows that's actually where
all the interesting stuff

572
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:08,082
is happening anymore.

573
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,040
Have you been to Los Angeles?

574
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:11,694
You know, I took my little
cousin Seth for his birthday

575
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,130
to Disney World.
Yeah.

576
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,131
That's in Florida.
But...

577
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:15,002
It's close enough.

578
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:19,876
- So how long are you hear, Amy?
- Yeah.

579
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,661
I don't know.

580
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,403
I got a lot of balls in the
air and irons in the fire.

581
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,928
So... yeah.

582
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,103
Yeah.

583
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,278
I'm gonna be around for a while.

584
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,236
Well, good, because
Shannon, I know,

585
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,934
has been working her little
behind off around the house.

586
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:35,457
And maybe you
could help her out.

587
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:37,764
You know, help your sister out.

588
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,243
There's a big laundry
list of things to do.

589
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:41,507
And you could kind of tick
off some stuff for her.

590
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,900
You can do some stuff
together, definitely.

591
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,554
But I there are some things you
could kind of take on yourself.

592
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:53,083
Say, Wes, while we're on
the topic of laundry lists

593
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,695
and documents, I
was wondering if you

594
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,131
by chance, just
out of curiosity,

595
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:01,004
know if Nana had a will?

596
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:02,136
No.

597
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,746
I... I don't know
if she had a will.

598
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,008
I just come by and make
sure she's comfortable.

599
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,184
Yeah.

600
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,621
But don't you think she'd be
so much more comfortable if she

601
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,971
knew her affairs were
in order and everyone

602
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,015
knew where her money was going?

603
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,756
Amy.

604
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:17,064
Amy, the only will I'm
really concerned with

605
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,545
is the will of the Lord.

606
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,894
Now, if you two
will excuse me,

607
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,286
I'm going to go
scurrying on upstairs

608
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,986
and take care of the
lady of the hour.

609
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,641
If you're in town for a while,
you should stop by my church.

610
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:29,816
It might do you some good.

611
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:34,690
Whoa.

612
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,432
Look what I found.

613
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,173
Remember how much we
used to play with those?

614
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,348
I know.

615
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,045
What a couple of
little dipshits.

616
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,569
No.
I thought that was fun.

617
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,919
It's a fucking
can with string.

618
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,574
How entertaining could it be?

619
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:50,837
Hello.

620
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,883
What's an orgasm?

621
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,494
- That's me being an 8-year-old.
- Yeah.

622
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,103
Got that.

623
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,676
Can I ask you question?

624
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,330
How much do you trust
this guy around Nana?

625
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,419
What do you mean?

626
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,510
I saw this "Dateline NBC"
episode where this guy dressed

627
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,990
up as a pastor and he would
go into old ladies' houses

628
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,731
and pretend to be a pastor.

629
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,298
And they would fall
in love with him

630
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:18,517
and leave them all their
money when they died.

631
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,695
No.

632
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,523
I'm not really worried
about that happening.

633
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,350
But he is right that there is a
bunch of stuff around the house

634
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,787
that needs to get fixed.

635
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,440
Like what?

636
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,312
Like the gutters
need to be cleaned out.

637
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,269
OK.

638
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,533
What else?

639
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,317
That chair needs to be fixed.

640
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,797
That thing?

641
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,102
I can fix that in
like five seconds.

642
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,278
What else?

643
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,106
She has a copy of "One Hour
Photo" that's like nine months

644
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,847
overdue.

645
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,327
Do you think you could
handle returning that?

646
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:49,156
Are you fucking serious?

647
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:50,374
Yes.

648
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:51,550
I can handle that.

649
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,120
Hey, Pat and I are
gonna go hang out in town.

650
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,600
Do you want to come?

651
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,167
I'm really busy
doing work right now.

652
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:01,777
Oh.

653
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,475
That's so strange,
cause it sounds

654
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:09,045
like you're watching "Murphy
Brown" reruns on your laptop.

655
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:09,524
It's research.

656
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,128
It's fucking
ill that you found

657
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,999
a coffee shop in this
town that makes pour over.

658
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,261
Yeah.

659
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,175
I found it online.

660
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:21,743
I guess it just opened.

661
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:23,745
I can't believe people drink
the cat piss they try to pass

662
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:24,920
off as coffee in this town.

663
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:36,366
Why are you stopping here?

664
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,329
Turn around.

665
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,809
Turn around right now.

666
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,811
Look, Pastor Wes
felt really bad that we

667
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,073
got off on the wrong foot.

668
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,335
And he just wanted
to chat with us.

669
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,510
I'm not doing it.

670
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,686
- I'm not going there.
- OK.

671
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:52,339
Fine.

672
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:08,050
Shannon, crack
a window at least.

673
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,313
Shannon, dogs die like this.

674
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,493
Do they really have pour over?

675
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,407
Whoo.

676
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,278
How's everyone doing?

677
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:18,931
Good.

678
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,286
So Wes, how can we help you?

679
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,767
In someone's last
days, it becomes

680
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:32,683
crucially important to get
your ducks in a row as it were.

681
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,381
In terms of...

682
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,643
In terms of the afterlife.

683
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,384
Yeah, good question, Shannon.

684
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:38,602
Yeah.

685
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:39,952
I'm like barely out of my 20s.

686
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,475
So I don't think I have
to worry about that yet.

687
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:44,652
I'm talking about your
grandmother, of course.

688
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,481
She was a very, very important
member of our congregation.

689
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,178
And as such, I
would like to make

690
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,529
sure we're all on the same
page, if that makes any sense.

691
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,835
Well, yeah, I see
where this is going.

692
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:56,142
And where is that, Amy?

693
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,144
I've seen "Dateline."

694
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,493
I have too.

695
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,929
I saw the donation box up front.

696
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,235
It's stuffed full.

697
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,932
And those didn't
look like singles.

698
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,804
OK.

699
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,501
I don't... I can't connect that
to "Dateline" necessarily.

700
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,851
But we're raising money
for the youth group

701
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:13,768
to send them to South America
on an extreme Bible mission trip

702
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,944
to bring food and
water and skateboards

703
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,816
to under-served communities
in Peru, actually.

704
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:18,338
There's the poster.

705
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:23,125
Wow.

706
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,344
We're very proud of it.

707
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:25,954
OK.

708
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,087
I brought you here
today, because I think

709
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,567
your grandmother would be able
to pass on into the afterlife

710
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:33,875
a little bit easier
if she knew you two

711
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,747
were baptized in this church.
Yeah.

712
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,358
No fucking way.

713
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,621
Oh, and with the
language again.

714
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,536
Oh, I get it.

715
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,799
He's... he's doing a
kickflip on a skateboard

716
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,887
that's a... but it's a cross.

717
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,280
You stay out of this, Shannon.

718
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,672
This is between me
and Billy Graham.

719
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:50,152
I'm sorry, Billy Graham?

720
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,850
- Did I stutter?
- Yeah.

721
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,113
You just did a little bit
on the actual word stutter?

722
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,636
And maybe you're
doing ironically.

723
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:56,680
But I think you were
doing it ironically

724
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,421
as a way of being defensive.

725
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:01,642
I'm only being defensive,
because you're being offensive

726
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,426
in an environment
that is traditionally

727
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:06,908
known as a safe space, at
least from a legal standpoint.

728
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,301
I didn't want to
have to do this here.

729
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:10,129
But I'm just gonna
have to go ahead.

730
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,524
Lord, we thank you today as we
send these girls on a journey,

731
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,483
a journey of new beginnings.
Please...

732
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:17,701
What are you doing?

733
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,529
In the name of the
Father, the Son...

734
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,835
You can't do that.

735
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:21,880
And the Holy Spirit.

736
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,793
It's seltzer water.

737
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:23,620
No.

738
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:24,534
Stop it.

739
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,842
It's raspberry flavored.

740
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,888
I can't believe you told
a clergymen go fuck himself.

741
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,715
He may be exempt from
taxes, but that does not mean

742
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,108
he's exempt from criticism.

743
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,241
He clearly just wants a
piece of Nana's estate.

744
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,417
Why are you so paranoid that
everyone wants Nana's money?

745
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,723
Because I've seen it happen
a million times before.

746
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:41,073
You've seen what happen
a million times before?

747
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:42,596
This.

748
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,728
I don't know what this is.

749
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:47,557
Don't you think that's
part of the problem, Shannon?

750
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:49,733
I seriously wonder if
you were adopted sometimes.

751
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:07,838
Is that a new jacket?

752
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,275
Oh, yeah.

753
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:10,798
I... I got it when
you guys were our?

754
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,540
Isn't that the
same one Ted has?

755
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,976
I think it's...

756
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:17,848
I think it's similar.

757
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:22,027
But I think the... the
stitching's different.

758
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:23,767
OK.

759
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:24,768
Two truths and a lie.

760
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:25,682
I'll go first, all right?

761
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:27,249
Ready?

762
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,860
Number one, I bought
a new jacket today.

763
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:33,255
Two, I'm an orange
belt in Taekwondo.

764
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:39,174
And three, I once was
attacked by wild dogs.

765
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:40,480
And I made it out...

766
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,656
I beat all them up
and made it out.

767
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,266
- Three is the lie.
- Yeah.

768
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,051
You got it.

769
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,531
So do you drink or do I drink?

770
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:49,576
- I think we all drink.
- All right.

771
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:50,185
Sounds good to me.

772
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,758
OK.
I'll go.

773
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:02,415
Number one, Jeff Koons
once exposed himself to me.

774
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:05,026
Number two, Alexa
Chung once tried

775
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:08,769
to sell me fake blow in the
bathroom of a Cirque du Soleil.

776
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,425
Or three, I once had an
abortion in the middle

777
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,948
of a three week juice cleanse.

778
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:14,993
Well, you had...

779
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,037
I don't want to know.

780
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:19,780
Is it... is it two?

781
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,911
You got it.

782
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,609
- The blow was definitely real.
- Wow.

783
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,393
What Cirque did you see?

784
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,569
The underwater one.

785
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,353
That's a good one.

786
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,006
Oh my god.

787
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:29,703
It was amazing.

788
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,052
You guys are not doing
this game right at all.

789
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:33,011
That's not a lie.

790
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,231
You still did the blow, with
Alex Chung or whatever her name is.

791
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,929
If that's not how it's played,
how... how should we play it?

792
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,019
We used to make
them less obvious.

793
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:47,808
Like for me, I would say, one,
I've never been to Europe.

794
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,593
Two, I'm writing a novel.

795
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:54,815
Or three, I broke my
arm in the third grade.

796
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:55,903
Number three is lie.

797
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,817
No.

798
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:57,731
Number one.

799
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:58,645
I've never been to Europe.

800
00:33:58,775 --> 00:33:59,167
No.

801
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,690
Bullshit.

802
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:01,778
You broke your arm
in the fourth grade.

803
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,693
Well, what difference
does that make?

804
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:04,825
Well, if you're gonna play
fast and loose with the truth,

805
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,174
then this game is
just a feeble charade.

806
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:07,306
Well, how do you
even know that that's

807
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,524
a grade that I broke it in?

808
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,048
I read it in your diary.

809
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:11,527
You read my diary?

810
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:12,920
- Yeah.
- Like when?

811
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,008
Like... like in middle school?

812
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,704
No.

813
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,402
Like last night.

814
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:17,664
What the fuck?

815
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:18,708
Are you serious?

816
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:19,753
Yeah.

817
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,798
What's the big deal?

818
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,063
I like found it in a box and
I liked flipped through it.

819
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:27,630
It's not like you're afraid
of drinking fountains anymore.

820
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,458
You're afraid of
drinking fountains?

821
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,853
My god the best part was when
you were talking about Ted.

822
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:37,945
Oh my god, Ted got the
cutest bowl cut today.

823
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:43,603
Ted sat next to me in lunch
and he ate all his prunes.

824
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,040
There was like an entire page
just like covered in his name

825
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,259
in like bubble letters.

826
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,695
That's very funny, Amy.

827
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,000
That's a great joke.

828
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,221
I'll go upstairs
and get and show you.

829
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:54,266
Oh my gosh.

830
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:57,095
I am... I'm gonna go inside.

831
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,357
I am... I'm beat.

832
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,533
You guys have... you guys have...

833
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:01,882
you guys have fun.

834
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:02,883
You don't have to go.

835
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:03,753
No, no, no.

836
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:04,624
It's all right.

837
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:05,581
Right?

838
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:06,321
Hey, have a good night.

839
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:15,939
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

840
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,245
Why would you think that's OK?

841
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,333
We're sisters.

842
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,030
I figured we share everything.

843
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,423
Oh.

844
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:22,511
Oh, OK.

845
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,253
So... so now, we're sisters?

846
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:28,126
Were we sisters when you
disappeared after mom's funeral

847
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,432
and went to La and nobody
heard from you for three years?

848
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:31,520
That's not what happened.

849
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:32,869
- Yes, it is.
- No.

850
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,914
I went to a yoga
retreat in Martha.

851
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,568
And then, I went to LA.

852
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:38,223
How do you think
that made me feel?

853
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,660
Huh?

854
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,662
I really could've used some
of that sister sharing then.

855
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:48,842
You know, I don't even know
why I'm surprised that you

856
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:51,671
would do something like this.

857
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,238
I thought you came
back to see Nana

858
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,110
and, I don't know,
maybe to see me.

859
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,286
But you came back to
get your inheritance.

860
00:35:58,417 --> 00:35:59,853
And then, you're gonna
leave and no one's

861
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:00,854
gonna hear from you again.

862
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:01,724
What do you want
me to say, huh?

863
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,902
You want to hear
how I'm, like, broke

864
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,600
and unsuccessful out there?

865
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,775
What are you talking about?

866
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:10,516
You're on a big TV show.

867
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,953
I was a background extra
on a fucking soap opera.

868
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,781
And it's the only paycheck
I've had in months.

869
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,610
So yeah, I do need the
money, because I'm broke.

870
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,872
I'm gonna have to
move out of my shitty

871
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,961
fucking studio apartment.

872
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,397
Well, you're always
talking about how you live

873
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,182
in such a nice neighborhood.

874
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:25,444
Don't get me wrong, the
neighborhood is fucking...

875
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:26,706
Then, why don't you
move to a cheaper one?

876
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:31,667
God, I'm sick of this town.

877
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:37,804
I'm sick of not
being able to find

878
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,588
a decent bottle of Lambrusco.

879
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,416
I'm sick of boning poor townies.

880
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:48,989
What poor townies
did you bone?

881
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,208
I was kidding.

882
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:51,252
Never mind.

883
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:52,166
What poor townies?

884
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,433
Ted?

885
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,870
Is Ted the poor townie?

886
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:01,958
It wasn't a big deal, OK?

887
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,530
I thought this game
was an exercise

888
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,444
in openness and honesty.

889
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,843
Guess that was the lie.

890
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:31,891
Amy?

891
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,113
Oh my god.
Amy, hi.

892
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:38,854
Hey.

893
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,073
It's... it's Rachel.

894
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,727
Yeah, Ra...
Rachel.

895
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:42,554
Hey.

896
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:43,511
Hi.

897
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,164
Are you OK?

898
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh, that?

899
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:47,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

900
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,169
I was just doing that as a joke.

901
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:50,910
Oh, OK.

902
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,564
OK.

903
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,174
I hear you're in LA now.

904
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:54,609
That's great.

905
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,567
Yeah.

906
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,699
I live right off of 5.

907
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,135
I'm not really
sure what that means.

908
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,050
Yeah.

909
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,051
It's like one of the biggest
highways in the city.

910
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,531
Oh.
Yes.

911
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:04,793
Of course.
Yeah.

912
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,186
Well, that's great.

913
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,493
And oh my gosh, I saw
your episode of where

914
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,103
"Where to Sin in
Brentwood Park."

915
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:11,191
That's amazing.

916
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,671
Congratulations.

917
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,759
Oh.

918
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,109
Thank you so much.

919
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,676
And like what about you?

920
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:21,636
- You're like in like still into...
- Theater.

921
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:23,421
Yeah, theater.

922
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,118
Yeah, you were like always
like really into the theater.

923
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:27,555
I'm actually
teaching acting now

924
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,427
down at the community college.
Wow.

925
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,647
That's so great, Ra...

926
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:33,343
Rachel.

927
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:33,909
Yeah, Rachel.

928
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,607
Yeah.

929
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:36,608
It's so weird you keep
doing that, because I like...

930
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,175
I totally know your name.

931
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,221
Hey, would you
have any interest

932
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,005
in stopping by my class?

933
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:46,618
I know that they would love
to hear from a real Hollywood

934
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,141
star like you.

935
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:49,359
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

936
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,404
Of course.

937
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:52,232
Oh, that's great.

938
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:54,582
I'm actually on my way
there do you want to join?

939
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,758
Like, right now?

940
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,238
Yeah.

941
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,589
I mean, unless you have
something else to do.

942
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,808
Yeah, i actually...

943
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:11,294
So can you just talk a
little bit about Hollywood?

944
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:15,342
LA is like fucking tight.

945
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,126
There's like really
great Coffee.

946
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:21,304
Cafe Lux has like a cold brew
that'll like make you come.

947
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:22,001
Like serious.

948
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,875
There's like really
great sushi downtown,

949
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,877
but like not much else.

950
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:31,140
Great.

951
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:32,315
What about acting there?

952
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,274
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

953
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:35,493
Yeah, sure.

954
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:42,674
Um yeah, it's like really hard.

955
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:44,806
You like basically
want to be with the one

956
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,721
in the big five agencies.

957
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:49,594
I'm of course, with CIA.

958
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:56,209
And you know, just like
pound the pavement.

959
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,776
Great.

960
00:41:57,906 --> 00:42:00,648
Does anyone have any
questions for Amy?

961
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:02,171
Yeah, Kate.

962
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,651
Have you ever been
to the Walk of Fame?

963
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:05,218
Yes, unfortunately.

964
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:06,611
Cool.

965
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,264
I was accosted by a
Jamaican there once.

966
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:11,311
Oh my god.

967
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,008
Yeah.

968
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,316
Do you have any
experience with UCB?

969
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,274
Is that a bar?

970
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,319
No.

971
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:20,886
It's a theater.

972
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:25,847
Amy, can you talk a little
bit about your process?

973
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,196
My process.

974
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,198
Your acting process.

975
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:32,114
Oh, right.

976
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:36,031
It like... it like...

977
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,859
it changes for
like every project.

978
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:46,389
I like employ a lot of
breathing techniques.

979
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,395
And I actually like the
traditional notion of a process

980
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:55,224
is like actually like a fallacy.

981
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:56,965
So like, I wouldn't
want to conform.

982
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:04,103
Yeah.

983
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,104
It's different
for every project.

984
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:06,192
Cool.

985
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:07,149
That's really cool.

986
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,498
Yeah.
Great.

987
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:17,159
So we're working on our
final scene for the semester.

988
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,772
Would you have any interest
in maybe running some lines?

989
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:21,555
- Yeah.
- Great.

990
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:22,295
Sure.

991
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:24,602
Great.

992
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:28,257
So we're doing a scene
from "Slumdog Millionaire."

993
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,433
And it's scene 11.

994
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,697
You can Latika.

995
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:36,309
And um Kevin, do
you want to come

996
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,398
up and do a scene with Amy?

997
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:39,225
- Yeah.
- Great.

998
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:39,617
Cool.

999
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:46,232
So...

1000
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:46,754
Hey.

1001
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:48,321
Hey.

1002
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:49,452
OK.

1003
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,802
So let's just take
it from the top.

1004
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:53,152
And are you guys ready?

1005
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:54,153
OK.

1006
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:54,762
Great.
Cool.

1007
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:55,110
Great.

1008
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:02,161
And action.

1009
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,511
He'll kill us if we go back.

1010
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,993
He was going to take your
eyes out, for God's sake,

1011
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:08,384
with a bloody spoon.

1012
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:15,000
How could you do this to me?

1013
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:15,609
Um...

1014
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,697
No.

1015
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,307
How could you do this to me?

1016
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,570
You disappear for three
years and you come back

1017
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:22,921
and you fucking
betray me like this?

1018
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,662
No.

1019
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,576
It was one thing when you
locked me in the basement

1020
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,840
when we were kids
on Halloween, but

1021
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:34,628
to come here and read my
fucking diary, how could you?

1022
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:37,675
How could you be so
callous and so insensitive?

1023
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,548
I thought I knew you, but I
don't know a thing about you.

1024
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,423
Nana is dying in the other
room, her life leaving her more

1025
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:49,512
and more with every breath.

1026
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:53,342
And you somehow summon the
gall to come in here and rifle

1027
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:57,651
through my things with no
consideration of my feelings.

1028
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:58,391
You know, I...

1029
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:05,703
I shouldn't be surprised that
you'd do something like this.

1030
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,880
No.
It's so easy for you.

1031
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,231
It's so easy for you, because
you can just run off to LA.

1032
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:16,452
You can just run off to your
shitty fucking apartment,

1033
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,280
but I can't.

1034
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:19,368
I can't.

1035
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:20,326
This is my life.

1036
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,241
This is my life.

1037
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:26,332
And if you can't see that,
then to hell with you.

1038
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:27,115
To hell with you.

1039
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:37,343
That was absolutely brilliant.

1040
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,048
I just can't believe Amy.

1041
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,007
Yeah?

1042
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:52,575
Well, I thought we
were gonna, you know,

1043
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:54,969
come maybe get ourselves a treat
and do some window shopping

1044
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,318
and not talk about
your older sister.

1045
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:56,841
No.

1046
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:58,320
I know.

1047
00:45:58,451 --> 00:46:01,715
You're... you're right.
You're right.

1048
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:11,420
Just go... go to Was World
and check out the new scents.

1049
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,508
I'll be good.

1050
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:13,335
Yeah?

1051
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:14,946
Yeah.

1052
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:15,555
That sounds good.

1053
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:16,599
Sounds good.

1054
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,166
There's actually...

1055
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:19,820
I'm really sorry to
interrupt you, Pat.

1056
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:26,000
I just... she's just like this
Hollywood brat, you know?

1057
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:28,394
Just like comes
into town whenever

1058
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,788
it's convenient for
her and then just fucks

1059
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,180
whoever she wants to.

1060
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,618
And it just... it
really pisses me off.

1061
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:37,403
Wait.
Who did Amy fuck?

1062
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,622
Ted.

1063
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:41,624
Can you believe that?

1064
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:44,584
Why do you care
if Amy fucks Ted?

1065
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:48,631
Well, I don't like
care, obviously.

1066
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:51,591
It's like the
principle of the thing.

1067
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:56,074
I mean, it's gonna be weird
now every time we see him.

1068
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:57,945
I'm confused.

1069
00:46:58,076 --> 00:46:59,991
- Could you just back me up?
- Yeah.

1070
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:00,600
100%.

1071
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,949
Of course.

1072
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,472
Thank you.

1073
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:08,173
Um, what do you want to do?

1074
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:09,565
Well, you know what?

1075
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:13,265
I... I think I just
need to be alone.

1076
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:18,444
I'm gonna like go chill in
the food court, have a fro-yo.

1077
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:19,358
Is that OK?

1078
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:20,185
Oh, without me?

1079
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:21,055
Yeah.

1080
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:22,578
Yeah.

1081
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:25,538
I will find a way to
occupy myself so that you

1082
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,192
can have some alone time.

1083
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,323
OK.

1084
00:47:28,454 --> 00:47:29,150
- All right?
- Thanks.

1085
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:29,368
I'll see you at home.

1086
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:46,559
A nice little boys
night we got here, huh?

1087
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,474
Yeah.

1088
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:49,997
Are you sure you don't
want to try my Margarita?

1089
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:52,043
It's probably the
best I've ever had.

1090
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,262
I'm good with the beer.

1091
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:57,396
Ted, thank you for
coming out so last minute.

1092
00:47:57,526 --> 00:48:02,314
I um... I got to
admit, things are

1093
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:04,359
kind of heated at the house.

1094
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,666
Did you tell Shannon
that I slept with Amy?

1095
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:07,493
Oh, no, no, no.

1096
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:09,712
I... I just...

1097
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:10,931
I just found out myself.
So...

1098
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,150
I didn't want her
to find out, you know.

1099
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,803
It was like this
big drunk thing.

1100
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:14,804
It was a huge mistake.
It was stupid.

1101
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:15,457
So...

1102
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:16,371
Right.

1103
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:17,242
No... no problem.

1104
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:19,809
Cool.

1105
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:25,946
Can I... this is just such...
this is kind of dude bro talk.

1106
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:27,382
Can I ask you what it's like...

1107
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:28,427
What?
Sleep with Amy?

1108
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:29,297
Yeah.

1109
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,081
It was weird, man.

1110
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,865
It was really weird.

1111
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:33,475
It was really aggressive,
you know what I mean?

1112
00:48:33,606 --> 00:48:34,433
More than I thought it would
be, like a lot of chanting,

1113
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:36,043
a lot weird stuff, man.

1114
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:37,305
Chanting?

1115
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:38,611
You heard of Kama Sutra?

1116
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:39,960
No.

1117
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:41,092
Me either, but she
was talking about...

1118
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,745
a lot about stuff like that.

1119
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:44,530
Just the sounds that were
coming out of her was just...

1120
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,879
I don't know, man.

1121
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,881
She tore me up.

1122
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:53,582
Well, Ted, I think it'd
be a great idea if you came

1123
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:57,151
to Nana's house and
you guys all talked

1124
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:58,500
and smoothed things over.

1125
00:48:58,631 --> 00:48:59,414
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1126
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:01,199
Yeah.

1127
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,201
Could can make some drinks
and put the kettle corn on.

1128
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:04,724
It's just simple
syrup and kernels

1129
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:05,594
and you just kind of let it go.
And...

1130
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:07,466
All right.

1131
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:08,902
Actually, that doesn't sound
like too bad of an idea,

1132
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:09,642
especially if there's
kettle corn there.

1133
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:11,513
I fucking love can kettle corn.

1134
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:12,732
You know what also sounds
like not too bad of an idea?

1135
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,952
Getting some grub at the table.

1136
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:20,131
I read online that this
cantina has the best pambazo.

1137
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:21,219
What's pambazo?

1138
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:21,654
No idea.

1139
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:42,414
Are you fucking kidding me?

1140
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,250
Cool jacket, man.

1141
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,122
Hey, thanks, Ted.

1142
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:05,045
Hello?

1143
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,220
Hey, babe.
How was dinner?

1144
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:11,399
- Hi, Ted.
- Hey.

1145
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,966
It was really good.

1146
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:15,708
We actually were just
having some pambazo,

1147
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:17,666
just a little boys' night out.

1148
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:18,841
You guys want a...

1149
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:19,929
you guys want a drink?

1150
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,193
- I can whip up some Gimlets.
- Yeah.

1151
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,856
Hey.

1152
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,467
Meet me at the front door.

1153
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:35,989
Yeah, sure.

1154
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,556
I'll come.

1155
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:39,732
And bring some vodka.

1156
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:41,212
Amy, what are you doing here?

1157
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:42,604
Shannon locked me out.

1158
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:43,866
Oh, OK.

1159
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:44,867
Well, I... oh.

1160
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:48,915
God, that's good.

1161
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,568
Really?

1162
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:50,786
Yeah.

1163
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:53,267
Thanks.

1164
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,226
Shannon's gonna be really
mad that you're here.

1165
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:56,966
And um, also Ted's here.

1166
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,577
What the hell
is Ted doing here?

1167
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:01,319
Oh, we were just
getting pambazo

1168
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:05,453
and I brought him back here,
kind of a boys' night out.

1169
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:06,628
What the fuck is pambazo?

1170
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:07,673
It's a Mexican white...

1171
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:08,500
Never mind.

1172
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,588
Come with me.

1173
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:12,460
Where?

1174
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:15,942
Say, we're all out of vodka.

1175
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,684
So only had enough to make two.

1176
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,642
So I'm just gonna run to the
store and grab some more.

1177
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:22,383
Oh, you... you don't
need to do that.

1178
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:23,558
I will.

1179
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:23,906
I'll be right back.

1180
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:37,920
Ultimately, I think the best way
to structure it is a Roth IRA,

1181
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:42,447
even though the annual
contribution cap is $55,000.

1182
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:44,623
But I have a mini golf
buddy who works at H&R Block

1183
00:51:44,753 --> 00:51:45,624
and that's what
he was telling me.

1184
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:46,233
So...

1185
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:47,756
Wow.

1186
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:48,757
So you're like really
into retirement.

1187
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:49,802
Oh, you're telling me.

1188
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,847
Yeah.

1189
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:55,677
I put at least 45% of every
paycheck into the bucket.

1190
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:59,551
I mean, you have got
to know that's insane.

1191
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:04,773
I'll tell you what's
insane, not being prepared.

1192
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:07,428
You know, I don't think I've
ever asked you what you do.

1193
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,908
I work at a soup restaurant.

1194
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:11,128
Wow.

1195
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:12,085
You work with homeless people.

1196
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,826
That must be so rewarding.

1197
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,784
It's not a soup kitchen.

1198
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:17,264
It's a restaurant that sells
soup, although we do have

1199
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:19,310
a homeless guy who jerks
off in the bathroom

1200
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,528
on a consistent basis.

1201
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:22,748
So...

1202
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:24,271
So you and Amy?

1203
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:25,925
Huh.

1204
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:26,708
Yup.

1205
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:27,361
Yeah.

1206
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:29,537
Yeah.

1207
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:30,582
Sorry about that.

1208
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:31,931
I feel like it's weird now.

1209
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:32,932
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1210
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,281
Don't apologize.

1211
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:35,804
I think it's great.

1212
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:36,544
Really?

1213
00:52:36,675 --> 00:52:37,458
Yeah.

1214
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:40,157
Yeah.

1215
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:43,682
Maybe she'll be easier to be
around once she gets fucked.

1216
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:45,553
You know, we have more
of a mature relationship,

1217
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:47,425
Shani and I. You know?

1218
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:50,993
We... we're in bed,
most nights, by

1219
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:54,475
or before 9, which in some
ways is better than sex.

1220
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:55,737
Really?

1221
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:57,739
No.

1222
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:58,131
No.

1223
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:03,397
Can I tell you a secret?

1224
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:05,094
Hit me.

1225
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:09,316
I'm thinking of
proposing to her.

1226
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:10,926
Wow.

1227
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,711
Bombshell.

1228
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:14,191
Do you think that's dumb?

1229
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:16,802
The outdated institutions
of marriage and monogamy

1230
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:17,759
or you proposing to Shannon?

1231
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:20,849
Either.

1232
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:26,377
I think you guys
are great together

1233
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:27,813
and that's all that matters.

1234
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:33,819
So 9 PM, huh?

1235
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,821
Not always that early, but...

1236
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:37,388
It's pretty lame either way.

1237
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:41,000
Do you remember Jeff
Cornelius from high school?

1238
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,785
Was he the guy that threw
the dead cat in the lunchroom?

1239
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,004
No.

1240
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,048
That was... that was Kyle Flynn.

1241
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:48,050
And I think also me.

1242
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:51,097
But Cornelius was the
guy who used a Doritos

1243
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,055
bag as a condom one time.

1244
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:55,101
What?
What?

1245
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,581
You didn't hear about that?

1246
00:53:56,711 --> 00:53:57,843
That was huge.

1247
00:53:57,973 --> 00:53:59,105
What flavor?

1248
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,064
Cool Ranch, for
sure, obviously.

1249
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:07,069
Actually, I recall
reading an article

1250
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,595
about how Cool Ranch is a
highly effective contraceptive.

1251
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:11,596
I think I read that too.

1252
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:13,206
Yeah, that was very...

1253
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:15,295
that was in a well-published
medical journal.

1254
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:16,818
I think it was Mad Magazine.

1255
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:24,217
I wonder where Pat went.

1256
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,915
Um, I mean, the liquor
store's pretty far away.

1257
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:29,701
So I don't know...
and you and him are...

1258
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:31,224
you guys are pretty
serious, huh?

1259
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,051
Yeah.

1260
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:34,575
Yeah, we are.

1261
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:37,012
I mean, we live together.

1262
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:42,017
We have a shared Netflix queue.

1263
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:44,150
I didn't know they
still had the... the queue.

1264
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,065
Yeah.

1265
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:47,371
And he's like a karate guy?

1266
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:48,676
Or what does he...
what is his thing?

1267
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:49,373
Mhm.

1268
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:50,809
Yeah.

1269
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:51,984
Yeah.

1270
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:54,116
He's training to
get his black belt.

1271
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:55,204
- Very cool.
- Wow.

1272
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:56,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

1273
00:54:56,902 --> 00:54:58,251
Karate's like... it's
one of those things

1274
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,122
where like if I wanted
to do it, I would be

1275
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,689
like really really good at it.

1276
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,343
Oh, really?

1277
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:04,953
I mean, I'm not saying
they'd give me my own dojo,

1278
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:07,086
but I'd probably get a
black belt pretty quickly.

1279
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:08,653
I'm saying week one I get...

1280
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:10,307
I get my black belt for sure.

1281
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,138
That's crazy hearing
all those stories

1282
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:20,229
about people from high school.

1283
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,408
You know, the craziest
thing about back

1284
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:31,676
then is that I had like
a huge crush on you

1285
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:32,285
all through high school.

1286
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:39,423
- You did?
- Yeah.

1287
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:03,708
You want some?

1288
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,972
It'd probably like totally
ruin my Taekwondo routine,

1289
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:09,148
but yeah.

1290
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:12,891
I guess I could
try to take a drag.

1291
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:14,066
Is this how you do it?

1292
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:31,605
Can I ask you something?

1293
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:33,694
Mhm.

1294
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:35,609
Why are you always
like lifting weights

1295
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,265
and doing P90X and stuff?

1296
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,527
I never really
thought about it.

1297
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,840
I guess I always just
wanted to be somebody that,

1298
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,407
like, nobody ever fucked with.

1299
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:53,932
You know?

1300
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,333
You wait here.

1301
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,292
I'm gonna go get the
rest of that vodka.

1302
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,859
Don't tell
Shannon you're here.

1303
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,077
She's gonna be pissed
that you're here.

1304
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:09,948
I'll be quiet.

1305
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,285
Hey, hey.
Wake up.

1306
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,548
Let's go and get another drink.

1307
00:57:44,678 --> 00:57:45,897
You want to do that right now?

1308
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:46,811
Yeah, yeah.

1309
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:48,160
- I'm buying.
- OK.

1310
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:48,943
Let's live a little.

1311
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:10,008
Pat?
You home?

1312
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:01,015
Holy shit.

1313
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:08,980
Shannon, I love you.

1314
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,810
You're... you are
everything to me.

1315
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,943
I know it's been crazy lately.

1316
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:19,207
And I know we haven't made love
in two months and that's OK.

1317
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:21,079
I'm OK with that.

1318
00:59:21,209 --> 00:59:23,864
But there's a question that
I have been meaning to ask

1319
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:27,346
you for a really long time.

1320
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,870
And I really think now is
the perfect time to ask it.

1321
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:36,224
Will you take my
hand in marriage?

1322
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:40,881
Oh, hey.

1323
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:55,809
You see the sinks in there?

1324
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,419
Oh, man oh man.

1325
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,943
It's very nice.

1326
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:00,292
This is unexpected.

1327
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:01,554
What made you want to go out?

1328
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,730
You know, I thought
it'd be a real treat.

1329
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:05,558
Well, thank you.

1330
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,299
Wish I would've known
about it a little sooner.

1331
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:09,127
I would've dressed
up a little bit.

1332
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:10,607
Oh, no.

1333
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:12,652
You look great the
way that you are.

1334
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:16,917
Um, Shannon, there's actually
a question I wanted to ask you.

1335
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,049
Hey.

1336
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:20,355
Fancy meeting you guys here.

1337
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:21,574
Amy, what are you doing here?

1338
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,054
I just thought I'd
come tag-along, get

1339
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:24,403
a little nosh with you guys.

1340
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:25,709
Hey, can I get
you something to drink?

1341
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,015
Yeah, can I see
your list of bitters?

1342
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:29,408
Never mind.
What are you guys having?

1343
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:30,583
Frangelico.

1344
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:31,410
Oh, that sounds fancy.

1345
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,150
It's not.

1346
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,325
Trust me.

1347
01:00:33,455 --> 01:00:34,108
I'll just have a
large glass of gin.

1348
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,588
Thanks.

1349
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:36,850
You know, Shannon,
you've got the taste

1350
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:38,373
in liquor of an 11th grader.

1351
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:39,723
Amy, remind me
again why you're here?

1352
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,202
Oh, I just wanted to
come be with my family

1353
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,464
that I love so dearly.

1354
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:44,249
You know, I happened
to notice that you

1355
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:46,120
haven't fixed the chair or
returned "One Hour Photo."

1356
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:47,513
Not yet.
But I will.

1357
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,602
I think they have a very
liberal return policies.

1358
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,038
So I think we still
have a few more days.

1359
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:52,823
That was the simplest
thing you had to do.

1360
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,476
It seems like it should've been
pretty easy to take care of.

1361
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,522
It will be really easy to
take care of once I set my mind

1362
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,263
to it and initiate the process.

1363
01:00:58,393 --> 01:00:59,351
And when will that be?

1364
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:00,395
Right after I fix the chair.

1365
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:01,919
Did they bring
bread to the table?

1366
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:03,529
Excuse me.
Can read some... some bread?

1367
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,487
Yeah.
I don't work here.

1368
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:06,706
Can you find someone who does?

1369
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,273
Do you know what
your problem is?

1370
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:09,622
That I wasn't born
with a different sister?

1371
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,798
Your complete and utter
lack of responsibility.

1372
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:12,843
Oh, no.

1373
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:13,887
Mom's yelling at me again.

1374
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:15,019
Don't fucking say that.

1375
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:16,847
Don't censor me, Stalin.

1376
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:19,110
You're insane.

1377
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,112
Do you hear the things
that you say sometimes?

1378
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:22,635
What do you want me to say?

1379
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:23,810
You've been up my
ass this entire trip.

1380
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:25,333
Trip?

1381
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:27,292
This is not fucking
semester at sea.

1382
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:30,338
We're only here
because Nana is dying.

1383
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:31,035
Shannon, I actually...

1384
01:01:31,165 --> 01:01:32,950
Not now, Pat.

1385
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,648
You are treating this like it
is your own personal vacation,

1386
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,520
with no consideration for
what is actually important.

1387
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:43,003
You're a child, just drinking
all the time and screwing guys.

1388
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:45,092
Oh, is that what children
do, drink and have sex?

1389
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:46,964
You know what I mean.

1390
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:49,444
That reminds me of why I came
down to this little roadhouse.

1391
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:51,316
Great choice of venue
by the way, Pat.

1392
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:52,447
Oh, thanks.

1393
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:54,362
I have a question
for you, Shannon.

1394
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:56,016
I was poking around
your room earlier

1395
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,844
and I happened to come
across a little something.

1396
01:01:57,975 --> 01:01:59,280
Oh, perfect.

1397
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:00,717
You were going
through things again.

1398
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:02,196
You knew where Nana's
will was this entire time.

1399
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,458
And you thought it was
OK to hide it from me?

1400
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:05,330
So you read my diary
and now you're rifling

1401
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,592
through my fucking luggage.

1402
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,681
We are both gonna
inherit $75,000.

1403
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,291
And you thought it was
OK to hide it from me?

1404
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:11,771
Well, I only hid it
from you, because it's

1405
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:13,338
pretty obvious that you only
came back for the money.

1406
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:14,513
A, that's bullshit.

1407
01:02:14,643 --> 01:02:15,470
And B, where the fuck's my gin?

1408
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:17,298
Thank you.

1409
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:18,125
And C, I think you've been
hiding a lot of things lately.

1410
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:19,779
Oh, really?
Like what?

1411
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,649
Well, I don't like French
kissing the shit out of Ted.

1412
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,178
You French kissed Ted?

1413
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:36,491
That's not... that's not
what that sounds like.

1414
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:39,320
That's... that's... that's not...

1415
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:40,017
it's not... that's not...

1416
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,148
I was confused.

1417
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:42,497
That's not what it sounds like.

1418
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:43,847
It's... that... it's
actually... it's...

1419
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:45,283
it's just like a funny story.

1420
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:53,682
There's shrimp on this carpet.

1421
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:57,512
It's not even a
seafood restaurant.

1422
01:02:57,643 --> 01:02:58,165
Babe.

1423
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:05,303
Now, look what you've done.

1424
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:44,298
Pat.

1425
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:49,826
Pat?

1426
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:59,923
Jesus fucking Christ.

1427
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:02,577
So just, again, I'm a pastor.
And...

1428
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,101
I'm sorry.

1429
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:04,841
You just... you scared the
living shit out of me.

1430
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,059
Yeah.

1431
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,626
Where are you going?

1432
01:04:07,756 --> 01:04:09,846
I'm looking for my
sister's boyfriend.

1433
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:11,848
How is it going by the way,
with Shannon, I do want to ask?

1434
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:12,936
We're doing great.

1435
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:16,417
Thanks so much for asking.

1436
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:19,507
Your tone.

1437
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:20,378
What do you have against me?

1438
01:04:20,508 --> 01:04:21,596
I just got ask.

1439
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:21,988
Honestly?

1440
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:26,645
Your haircut.

1441
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:27,559
You look like John Edwards
joined the Hitler Youth.

1442
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:33,043
That hurt my feelings.

1443
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:35,828
You know?

1444
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,700
I think you have clinical
trust issues, if I may.

1445
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:40,659
That's what my therapist says.

1446
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,879
You really, really have
trouble letting people in.

1447
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:45,446
I mean, you... you withhold
love actively from people.

1448
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:46,665
OK?

1449
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:47,709
You're doing it with me.

1450
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,189
You do it to Shannon, clearly.

1451
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,627
And I bet you do it with
everyone back home in LA.

1452
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,194
What do you know?

1453
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:56,718
I know a lot more
than you think actually.

1454
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:58,372
You know, if you had
a little more faith,

1455
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:00,853
miraculous things
would start to happen.

1456
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:01,723
I'm gonna...

1457
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:06,293
OK.

1458
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:17,261
If one were to want to
stop withholding love,

1459
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:20,220
what would one do about that?

1460
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:21,918
So are you asking
for a friend or...

1461
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:23,963
- I'm asking for myself.
- OK.

1462
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:26,661
That was clear.

1463
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:31,057
I would start by forgiving.

1464
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:31,884
That's it?

1465
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,712
Mhm.

1466
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:35,714
I thought you were gonna
tell me something stupid, like

1467
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:37,368
to give myself over to God.

1468
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:38,630
Well, I baptized you already.

1469
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,588
So that's been taken care of.

1470
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:41,546
No You didn't.

1471
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,156
I rejected that baptism.

1472
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:44,157
Water hit your skin.

1473
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:45,898
You... you can't reject it.

1474
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:47,552
That baptism did not count.

1475
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:48,553
The water touched your skin.

1476
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:49,554
Water counts.

1477
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:51,773
I reject that baptism.

1478
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:54,689
The water counts.

1479
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,661
Hey, Pat.

1480
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:56,186
How you doing, buddy?

1481
01:06:56,316 --> 01:07:00,016
Oh, what do you think?

1482
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:00,886
Pat, come on.

1483
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,148
Stop it.

1484
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:02,931
Why?

1485
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:05,978
What's the point?

1486
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:09,242
Well, I mean, I'm pretty
sure that's littering.

1487
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:11,070
I was gonna drown
myself in the river,

1488
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:14,639
but I'm such a sick
swimmer that I'm

1489
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,249
pretty my fighter instincts
would've kicked in

1490
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,120
and not let me drown.

1491
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,439
I was so pumped to
propose to Shannon.

1492
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:37,444
Like... like I was really excited
to spend the rest of my life

1493
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:38,054
with her.

1494
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,755
And then, she goes and
kisses someone else.

1495
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:51,154
And Ted?

1496
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:54,635
What a fucking chode, you know?

1497
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:55,375
I trusted him.

1498
01:07:58,248 --> 01:08:00,859
Whatever happened to
bro's before hoes?

1499
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:02,078
I think part of the
problem there might

1500
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,558
be referring to women as hoes.

1501
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:07,909
It's just an expression.

1502
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,173
I don't think Shannon's a hoe.

1503
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:12,653
And I don't think you're a hoe.

1504
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:13,654
Thank you.

1505
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:22,881
You know, I'm not a
big actress, right?

1506
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:23,838
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, no.

1507
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:24,883
I know.

1508
01:08:25,013 --> 01:08:26,841
- You do?
- Yeah.

1509
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:29,105
I Googled you.

1510
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:32,238
What'd you find?

1511
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:32,847
Not a lot.

1512
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:36,677
Fuck.

1513
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:48,820
I work at a frozen yogurt shop...

1514
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,127
worked at a frozen yogurt shop.

1515
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:52,867
I'm pretty sure they
fired me after I

1516
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:55,261
stopped showing up last week.

1517
01:08:55,392 --> 01:08:59,657
I work at a fucking
soup restaurant.

1518
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,312
So we're both failures.

1519
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:03,051
Yeah.

1520
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:03,704
Yeah, I guess so.

1521
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:18,980
Um, I'm gonna go
talk to Shannon.

1522
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:22,897
Are you gonna be OK?

1523
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,465
Yeah.

1524
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:27,075
I've got something I
need to take care of.

1525
01:09:35,127 --> 01:09:35,997
I don't know.

1526
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:36,781
I don't know.

1527
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,831
I mean, I know you're
going through a lot.

1528
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:44,180
I am.

1529
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:50,795
It's like I was
the guinea pig.

1530
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:56,366
No.
You're not the guinea pig.

1531
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:00,326
I'm so sorry.

1532
01:10:30,574 --> 01:10:32,619
I hope you don't mind
that I borrowed your dress.

1533
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:38,669
I just thought it looked
cool and I don't know

1534
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:41,715
made me feel closer to you.

1535
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:44,152
No problem, Amy.

1536
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:47,330
It looks better on
you than it did on me.

1537
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,897
Nana, I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

1538
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:51,986
Yeah, well, you
know, sometimes

1539
01:10:52,117 --> 01:10:55,251
you just have to disconnect
from everything for a while.

1540
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,862
Why do you think I came
back to this shitty town?

1541
01:10:57,992 --> 01:10:58,906
No offense.

1542
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:00,995
It's OK.

1543
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,824
You can't find a decent cup
of coffee for miles around.

1544
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:04,434
Thank you.

1545
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:10,831
I'm sorry I couldn't come
back and help out more.

1546
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:12,355
It's OK.

1547
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:15,488
You've been busy in Hollywood.

1548
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:19,362
I still feel like
I should visit more.

1549
01:11:19,492 --> 01:11:22,582
Sometimes it feels like I don't
even have a family, you know?

1550
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:22,974
I hear you.

1551
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:33,245
You want some?

1552
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,900
Have you ever known me to
turn down a glass of wine?

1553
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:45,910
Where did you find this?

1554
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,998
In the corner cabinet?

1555
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:47,912
Yeah.

1556
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:50,262
It's all you had left.

1557
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:52,917
Well, I think that must
be three decades old.

1558
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,919
Yeah, well, me
too, am I right?

1559
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:02,840
Oh, Amy, don't worry.

1560
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,322
You're going to be fine.

1561
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:10,891
Oh, I know you worry about
your career and your finances

1562
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:13,416
and whether or not
you've ever really

1563
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:18,334
had an orgasm, but
just know that I have

1564
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:21,162
always been so proud of you.

1565
01:12:21,293 --> 01:12:28,866
Oh, Nana, I love you so much.

1566
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:29,693
I love you too.

1567
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:52,106
What were you thinking?

1568
01:12:52,237 --> 01:12:53,586
Like I'm genuinely
curious to know

1569
01:12:53,717 --> 01:12:55,153
what your thought process was.

1570
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:57,155
I'd never been down
to the river with her

1571
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:58,722
and I figured my
time was running out.

1572
01:12:58,852 --> 01:13:00,941
She could've died.

1573
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:04,728
I mean, she's already
kind of dying anyways.

1574
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:05,859
Oh my god.

1575
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:06,730
Right?

1576
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,167
Am I wrong about that?

1577
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:12,388
So it's not looking good.

1578
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,433
Due to her last round of
chemo, her immune system

1579
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,522
is incredibly vulnerable.

1580
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:18,785
And being outside near
the river last night,

1581
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,440
she developed pretty
severe pneumonia.

1582
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,181
I know in our last meeting,
I advised you to just

1583
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:24,312
pretty much keep her in bed.

1584
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:25,531
So I'm not sure
why anybody thought

1585
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:27,141
it was a good idea
to take her outside

1586
01:13:27,272 --> 01:13:29,448
in the middle of the night.

1587
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:30,928
I wasn't in that meeting.

1588
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,713
So no one told me
not to do that.

1589
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:35,149
Nobody told you not
to take your dying

1590
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,803
grandmother outside at 2:00 AM?

1591
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:38,588
No.

1592
01:13:38,718 --> 01:13:41,678
But I mean, I know not to
do that now going forward.

1593
01:13:41,808 --> 01:13:45,246
I also found trace amounts
of alcohol in her bloodstream.

1594
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:48,336
Do either of you know
what that's about?

1595
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:49,860
OK.

1596
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,775
I'm feeling really
attacked right now.

1597
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:53,037
OK.

1598
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,126
Doctor, what do we do now?

1599
01:13:55,256 --> 01:13:58,564
Besides not
taking her outside.

1600
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:01,262
Well, at this point,
there's not much we can do.

1601
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:03,047
Your grandmother's condition
has been deteriorating

1602
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:04,440
for quite some time.

1603
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,050
It was never a question
of whether or not

1604
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:06,920
she was going to pass.

1605
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:08,748
It was a matter of when.

1606
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:12,404
At this point, I would
say 24 to 48 hours.

1607
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:13,797
I think the best thing
we could do at this point

1608
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:16,234
is just try to keep her as
comfortable as possible.

1609
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:18,758
Are you fucking serious?

1610
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:21,195
Do your job.

1611
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:22,719
Didn't you take
the Socratic oath?

1612
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:23,546
Hippocratic?

1613
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:25,069
Yes I did.

1614
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,636
That's kind of what
this is all about.

1615
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:29,029
Listen, I'm not here to
argue semantics with you, pal.

1616
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,814
- Are you a doctor or not?
- Whoa.

1617
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:31,771
Look.

1618
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,207
I'm... I'm really sorry.

1619
01:14:33,338 --> 01:14:34,252
Could we please
have a moment alone?

1620
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:39,039
Amy.

1621
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:44,131
Amy.

1622
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:49,920
Amy, stop.

1623
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:57,101
I knew we should've gotten
a doctor from the city.

1624
01:14:57,231 --> 01:15:00,539
The entire American
healthcare system is fucked.

1625
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,628
We've got to bring
Nana to China.

1626
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:06,719
Herbs, acupuncture,
botanicals, spices, oil.

1627
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,155
What are you talking about?

1628
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:10,636
She has severe pneumonia.

1629
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:12,072
She wouldn't even make
it to the airport.

1630
01:15:12,203 --> 01:15:13,465
We'll take a boat.

1631
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:17,556
Amy, stop, OK?

1632
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:18,426
This is really serious.

1633
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:26,043
Well, what should we do?

1634
01:15:26,173 --> 01:15:27,087
I mean, what can we do?

1635
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:31,222
You heard what she said.

1636
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:36,749
You know Nana's had a
really long and happy life.

1637
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:45,366
And I think she deserves
to die with some dignity,

1638
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:46,063
in the company of her family.

1639
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:53,244
I think we should just let
nature take it's course.

1640
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:07,911
Can I just say that I am
so sorry about everything?

1641
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,303
No.
I'm sorry.

1642
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:12,132
I... I had no idea
you were that poor.

1643
01:16:12,263 --> 01:16:13,264
God, you don't have
to say it like that.

1644
01:16:13,394 --> 01:16:13,873
Sorry.

1645
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,055
So that's it?

1646
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:26,712
What do you mean?

1647
01:16:26,843 --> 01:16:27,495
We just let Nana...

1648
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:37,331
You know, I think we should
try to make her comfortable

1649
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,944
and maybe do something
with her that we

1650
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:42,119
would have wanted to do anyway.

1651
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:53,260
Stupid thing.

1652
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:54,697
I can't get a picture.

1653
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:55,959
Have
you tried turning it on?

1654
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,705
Want to watch another one?

1655
01:17:02,835 --> 01:17:05,098
I torrented all 10
seasons of "Murphy Brown."

1656
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:08,145
I can go all night.

1657
01:17:08,275 --> 01:17:09,102
Wait.

1658
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:10,364
Got any Cheladas left?

1659
01:17:10,495 --> 01:17:11,061
Oh, yeah.

1660
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:11,844
You know it.

1661
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:29,775
Thank you, Miles.

1662
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,599
We entreat you,
oh Lord, to look

1663
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,515
with favor on your
servant Catherine,

1664
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:17,040
who has passed on to your care.

1665
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:20,478
May you reunite her
with her husband Walter.

1666
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:23,089
Please refresh the life
that you have created

1667
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,918
and then taken away from us.

1668
01:18:26,049 --> 01:18:29,226
Chastened by suffering, may
she now know that she has been

1669
01:18:29,356 --> 01:18:31,794
saved through your healing.

1670
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:35,275
- Through Christ our Lord, amen.
- Amen.

1671
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:15,663
Thank you so much
for everything.

1672
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:18,405
You're welcome.

1673
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:24,672
I hope it wasn't too late to
do the last rites, I mean,

1674
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:27,501
after she's already dead.
It's fine.

1675
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,463
Can I do like a confession?

1676
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:33,377
Yeah.

1677
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:34,639
Come on down anytime.

1678
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,553
I stole a pen
from your office.

1679
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:37,424
Or do it now.

1680
01:19:37,555 --> 01:19:40,297
It fell between the cushions
in the car and it got stuck.

1681
01:19:40,427 --> 01:19:41,515
So I can't get it back.

1682
01:19:41,646 --> 01:19:45,563
But I wanted to get
that off my chest.

1683
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:47,870
You're forgiven.

1684
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,697
Cool.

1685
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:51,395
Thanks, Wes.

1686
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:52,265
Can I walk you out?

1687
01:19:52,396 --> 01:19:53,223
Sure thing.
Yeah.

1688
01:20:08,194 --> 01:20:10,022
Is this fucking
raspberry seltzer water?

1689
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:27,648
You still have this.

1690
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:29,433
Yeah, I thought I'd
keep and take the late fee

1691
01:20:29,563 --> 01:20:30,738
out of my inheritance.

1692
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:45,579
What are you gonna
do with yours?

1693
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:48,974
I don't know.

1694
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:51,107
I have a mountain
of student loans.

1695
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:56,242
So I thought I'd use some
of it to pay that off.

1696
01:20:56,373 --> 01:20:58,549
Boring.

1697
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:02,858
Well, what should
I do with it then?

1698
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:04,860
I don't know.

1699
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:05,861
Why don't you use some of
it and come visit me in LA?

1700
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:09,560
OK.

1701
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,779
Fine.

1702
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,389
That sounds good.

1703
01:21:15,696 --> 01:21:18,656
What are you gonna
do with yours?

1704
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:23,095
Besides buying DVDs?

1705
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:28,622
I think I might use some
of it and give it to Pastor

1706
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:30,233
Wes' church skateboarding trip.

1707
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:38,371
I think Nana would like that.

1708
01:21:38,502 --> 01:21:39,677
Yeah, I think so too.

1709
01:21:48,686 --> 01:21:49,513
Who's here?

1710
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:14,668
Hello?

1711
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:16,496
Amy, what's up?

1712
01:22:16,627 --> 01:22:17,715
It's your agent Dave.

1713
01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:18,455
How's it going?

1714
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:19,412
Oh, hi.

1715
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:20,718
Good to hear from you.

1716
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:22,459
Yeah,
so, hey, listen.

1717
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:23,939
I'm really sorry it's taken
me so long to get back to you.

1718
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:26,115
It's been kind of just a
hectic week around the office.

1719
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:28,813
I've also been having to
drive my kids around town,

1720
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,685
you know, back and forth
to soccer practice.

1721
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:33,078
We've normally got a
nanny that does that,

1722
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:34,819
but she's actually
been in the hospital

1723
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,255
for three or four days now.

1724
01:22:36,386 --> 01:22:37,300
Oh my god.

1725
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:38,344
Is she OK?

1726
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:40,172
I don't know.

1727
01:22:40,303 --> 01:22:41,521
She apparently inhaled some
chlorine or pool or something.

1728
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:42,827
We hired a replacement already.

1729
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:43,959
So it's not a big deal.

1730
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,482
But say, how's New Mexico?

1731
01:22:45,612 --> 01:22:46,570
- New York.
- Yeah.

1732
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,049
Cool.
Cool.

1733
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:48,093
Cool Cool.

1734
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:49,921
So hey, listen.

1735
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:50,791
I'm calling because I got
some good news for you

1736
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:52,010
and I got some bad news for you.

1737
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:52,750
Do you want to hear it?

1738
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,230
I think so.

1739
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,796
So bad
news is you didn't

1740
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:58,756
get that movie you auditioned
for a couple weeks ago.

1741
01:22:58,886 --> 01:23:00,627
But the good news is I
did book you a commercial.

1742
01:23:00,758 --> 01:23:02,586
Really?

1743
01:23:02,716 --> 01:23:03,848
Yeah, it's
a regional commercial for

1744
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,720
a dental school in the Midwest.

1745
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:08,853
Pay is not great,
but they're gonna

1746
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,986
fly you out and put
you up in a Radisson,

1747
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,117
which is pretty sweet.

1748
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:12,944
Wow.

1749
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:14,380
Yeah.

1750
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:15,381
It's actually something
I've been kind

1751
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:16,948
of wanting to discuss with you.

1752
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:18,515
I feel like we should
be kind of focusing more

1753
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:20,386
on commercial gigs like this.

1754
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:22,301
You know, I know you want
to do TV and film and stuff,

1755
01:23:22,432 --> 01:23:23,955
but maybe that's just
not the right direction

1756
01:23:24,086 --> 01:23:25,261
for you right now.

1757
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:27,567
Hey, Shannon
and I are gonna go

1758
01:23:27,698 --> 01:23:28,916
get some food, if you want to...

1759
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:32,746
Amy,
can you hear me?

1760
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:33,617
Fucking T-Mobile.

1761
01:23:33,747 --> 01:23:34,313
Amy.
