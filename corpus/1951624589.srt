1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,600
Good night, Carrie.

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,100
- Have a good weekend.
- Bye.

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, Mr. Burke.

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Your meeting on Monday
with Mr. Harrington

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,300
has been pushed back
to 1:15.

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Have a nice weekend.

7
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,600
You are not
where you belong.

8
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,400
- The girl broke the lamp.
- Which lamp?

9
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,900
- The antique lamp.
- In my room?

10
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,400
- Yes.
- Hmm.

11
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,600
That lamp cost
over $220.

12
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Well, maybe we can
get it fixed.

13
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
We're never gonna get it fixed.
I think that that's the point.

14
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
I think that's why
she did it.

15
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Yes.
All right.

16
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm going.

17
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Will you bring me
back some cigarettes?

18
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
- I'm not coming back.
- What?

19
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,300
- I'm not coming back.
- What do you mean?

20
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm going, and I'm not
going to come back.

21
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,400
- You're not ever coming back?
- No.

22
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,500
Why not?

23
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't want to live
this kind of life.

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,100
- What does that mean?
- That I can't live this life.

25
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,300
- You can't live this life?
- Yes.

26
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,200
So you're
leaving me?

27
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,100
Yes.

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ah.

29
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
Ah, ah.

30
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Then what about me?
Don't you love me anymore?

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
- No.
- You don't?

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,900
- No.
- And why is that?

33
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't know.

34
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,700
And when did you
find this out?

35
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,600
- A long time ago.
- You did?

36
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,500
- Yes.
- How long ago?

37
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,600
Years ago.

38
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,800
You've known for years
that you don't love me?

39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes.

40
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Oh.

41
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
Then why do you decide
you're leaving me now?

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
I've had enough.

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Yes, but why now?

44
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,000
Because you don't interest me,
spiritually or sexually.

45
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,800
Hadn't you known this
for some time?

46
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
- Why do you think?
- I think that you did.

47
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,900
- Yes, I did.
- Then why didn't you leave then?

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,500
Why didn't you leave then,
you stupid shit?

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,700
All of these years you say
you've been living here, huh?

50
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,600
You idiot!
I've had enough!

51
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,700
You idiot!
Passing judgment on me all this time!

52
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,700
- I never passed judgment...
- And then you tell me you're leaving!

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,200
- Yes.
- Go, then.

54
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
- I'll call ya.
- Please! And we'll talk.

55
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,100
What should we do with the house,
cut it in half? Go, get out of here, go!

56
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
- You think I'm fooling.
- I do not.

57
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,200
Goodbye.
Thank you. Goodbye!

58
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,400
Get out!
Get out of here!

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
And don't you ever come back,
do you hear me?

60
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll tell you
who's got it easy.

61
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,900
Who?

62
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
The niggers.

63
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,100
Sometimes I wish
I was a nigger.

64
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Sometimes I wish
I was too.

65
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,500
I'd rob a store.
I don't blame 'em, I swear to God.

66
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,600
Because I want to
tell ya,

67
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,900
we're bred to do
the things that we do.

68
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,600
- Yes.
- Northern race, one thing,

69
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,500
southern race...

70
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,100
somethin' else.

71
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
And what
they want to do

72
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,800
is sit under the tree
and watch the elephant.

73
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,600
And I don't blame them
one small bit.

74
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
Because there's too much
pressure on us.

75
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Yes.

76
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,700
And that's no joke, and that's not
poetry. It's just too much.

77
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,700
It is.
It absolutely is.

78
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,300
- A man has got to get out.
- What do you mean?

79
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,800
A man has got to get
away from himself.

80
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,700
That's true.

81
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
Hey, baby.

82
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Because the pressure
is too much.

83
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,200
What do you do?

84
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
What do you mean?

85
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
What do you do
to get out?

86
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,800
- What do I do?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
What are
the things to do?

88
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,100
What are the things
anyone does?

89
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Pussy?
I don't know. Pussy.

90
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
Power. Money.

91
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,000
Adventure.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,900
I think that's it.

93
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,800
Self-destruction.

94
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,200
I think that
that's it.

95
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,200
- Don't you?
- Yes.

96
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,400
Religion.

97
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Um, I suppose
that's it.

98
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Release.
Gratification.

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,600
You gotta get out, get something
that opens your nose.

100
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,000
Life is too short.

101
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
My wife and I
are incompatible.

102
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,500
I'm sorry to hear that.
In what way?

103
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,800
- I don't find her attractive.
- Mm.

104
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,600
- And she hates my guts.
- Mmm.

105
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,700
It's a boring thing to talk about,
but that's what's on my mind.

106
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,500
- I understand.
- You do?

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
- Yes.
- Thank you.

108
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,800
Believe me,
it's all right.

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,700
I know that
we all need it,

110
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,900
we don't know where to find it,
and I know what it means,

111
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,200
and I understand.

112
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
- I... feel...
- I know, like your balls were cut off.

113
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes. A long
long time ago.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,900
Mm-hmm.

115
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,300
And I don't
feel like a man.

116
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,000
- You know what you need?
- No.

117
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,100
You need to get laid.

118
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,800
I do.
I know I do.

119
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,900
And that's why
the niggers have it easy.

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,700
I'll tell you why.

121
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
There are responsibilities

122
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,100
they never have accepted.

123
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Try the Allegro.

124
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,700
What is that?

125
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
It's a club
on 47th Street.

126
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,400
I want this
to be on me.

127
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,400
I want you to remember

128
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,900
there was someone
who listened.

129
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
You'd do
the same for me.

130
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,200
Want to buy me
a drink?

131
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,100
I'm putting myself
at your mercy.

133
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,400
This is my first time
in a place like this.

134
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,100
I don't want to be taken advantage of.
You understand?

135
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Buy me a drink,
and we'll go in the back.

136
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,000
And do what?

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Whatever you want.

138
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,900
$50.

139
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Buy me a drink.

140
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,100
- You... get a commission on the drinks?
- Yes.

141
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,300
- How much commission do you get?
- 50%.

142
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
That's $100.

143
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
It's too much.

144
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,500
What?

145
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,700
Too much.
Thank you.

146
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,200
- 80.
- No, thank you.

147
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,700
- 80.
- I'll give you 50.

148
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
I'll give you the 50 you'd get
if I gave her 100 for the drink.

149
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,100
But I'm not gonna
give them 100.

150
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,100
- But you have to buy me a drink.
- No, I'm sorry.

151
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,400
All right,
give me 30.

152
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
- On top of the 50?
- Yeah, you give me 80.

153
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
- To you?
- Yes.

154
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,800
- I should give the 80 to you?
- Yes.

155
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
And then you give
her the 50?

156
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes, I got to
give her the 50.

157
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,600
- No.
- For the drink.

158
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,500
No, you don't have to
pay her for the drink... tea.

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,300
- It's not tea.
- It's not tea?

160
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
If it's not tea,
what is it then?

161
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
I came in here to be
straight with you!

162
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,000
Why do we have to
go through this?

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,300
Get in
or get out.

164
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,700
Don't mill around.

165
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Get in or get out.

166
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,800
Seven.
Go in seven.

167
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Oh, no. Six...
I mean, six.

168
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
Go in six.

169
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Take your dick out.

170
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Take your dick out.

171
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Come on.

172
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,100
Take your dick out.

173
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,100
- I'm not a cop.
- I know you're not a cop.

174
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Take your dick out.
I'm gonna give you a good time.

175
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,900
How do we get this
barrier to come down?

176
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
It doesn't come down.

177
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,900
Then how are you gonna
give me a good time?

178
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,500
Come here.

179
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,400
Give me 10 bucks.

180
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,200
Give me 10 bucks.

181
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,300
Put it through
the thing.

182
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Put it
through the thing.

183
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,900
I... don't have
10 bucks.

184
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Yes.
Give me the 20.

185
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
And you're gonna
make change?

186
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,200
Yes, just give me the 20.
Give it to me.

187
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Good.

188
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
Now take your dick out.

189
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Can... can I
have my 10?

190
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,700
Give me my 10 back.
Come on!

191
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,500
Give me my 10 bucks.

192
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,200
- Let me hold the 10.
- Give me my 10 back,

193
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,300
and I'll give you
a tip when you're done.

194
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
- Thank you.
- Now, take your dick out!

195
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,200
How do we get this thing
to come down?

196
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,100
It doesn't come down.

197
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,400
- It doesn't come down?
- No!

198
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,100
Well, then what the fuck
am I giving you 10 bucks for?

199
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,500
Look, you can touch me.

200
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,900
You can touch me.

201
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
I don't want to touch you.
I want you to touch me!

202
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Come on!
Honey, come on.

203
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
You're only
cheating yourself.

204
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,500
Yo, senorita. You want to make
some money, senorita?

205
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Put the money up.
You can't win if you don't play.

206
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
- Come on, man.
- I got you, I got you.

207
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,000
- What? 20.
- Yeah yeah yeah. Yo, bigger, baby.

208
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,600
The fellow over there?
He's a shill.

209
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,300
- Who is?
- You wanna do it one more time?

210
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,200
- You want to know how to beat the game?
- How?

211
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
You figure out which card
has got to win,

212
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,100
- and bet the other one.
- Who saw? Black's gonna get you back.

213
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,600
They're all shills.
They're all part of an act.

214
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,200
Here we go. Red is also gonna
get you men in black.

215
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
20 gets you 40,
40 gets you 80.

216
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,800
Cops cops cops cops.
Yo, don't run, don't run.

217
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,700
Come on.

218
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,600
Check it out, check it out.
I got you right here.

219
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,300
Yo, check me out
right here.

220
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Right here, check me out.
Yo, my man, what's up?

221
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,200
I got you.
All right, who needs it?

222
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,100
Check it out, man,
check it out.

223
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,300
Is this what you're
lookin' for, man?

224
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,100
Yo, I'm sayin', take it.
I'm tryin' to give you somethin'.

225
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,900
Now is that what you're
lookin' for or not?

226
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,000
- Is this true?
- Would I give it to you if it wasn't?

227
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

228
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,100
- Have you been here before?
- Uh, no.

229
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
How did you
hear about us?

230
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,700
- Are you from out of town?
- Yes.

231
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,700
- What's the deal here?
- This is a health club.

232
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,200
- I know.
- And our rates are by the hour.

233
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,400
- Yes?
- $68 for the first hour.

234
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,300
Sauna, free bar,
showers.

235
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,300
The hour doesn't start until you
and the masseuse are in the room.

236
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
All right.

237
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,400
Whatever happens in the room,
of course, is between you.

238
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,600
- I understand.
- You understand?

239
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,300
- Yes.
- For two hours it's $150.

240
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,500
If you want
two hostesses,

241
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,700
that'll be $200
for one hour.

242
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,000
Whatever arrangements you
choose to make with them is between you.

243
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,100
- Good.
- What would you like?

244
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,700
One hour.

245
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,400
You pay that now.
How would you like to pay?

246
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
- How can I pay?
- Cash or credit.

247
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,300
The billing on your card
will read, "Atlantic Ski and Tennis."

248
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Um, I'll pay with cash.
Thank you.

249
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,900
Not at all.
Have a lovely evening.

250
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,100
How are you?

251
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,500
Fine.
I've never done this before.

252
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,700
- No?
- No.

253
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,400
That feels good.

254
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,300
You've got
a good body.

255
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,200
Thank you.

256
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
Do you work out?

257
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
- I jog.
- Mmm.

258
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,200
And I used to wrestle
in high school.

259
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,400
You've kept yourself
in good shape.

260
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Thank you.

261
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
So what shall we do?

262
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,800
I'd like to have
intercourse with you.

263
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That sounds nice.
I'd like that too.

264
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
- You would?
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,100
- How much would that be?
- For a straight fuck, that'd be 250.

266
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Th-that's too much.

267
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,200
- You know I'm givin' you a break...
- No.

268
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,100
...'cause it's your
first time here.

269
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,400
No, it's too much on top
of the 68 at the door.

270
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
I know, I know, I know. But, you know,
I don't get to keep it all.

271
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,300
- It's too much.
- I split it with them.

272
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah, I mean,
they don't pay me, I pay them.

273
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,600
It's too much.

274
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
Okay, well, um,
how much do you have?

275
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,000
All I had was 100
for the whole thing.

276
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
- You mean 100 for it all?
- That only left me 30.

277
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,300
Honey, you couldn't
get a thing for that.

278
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,600
Well, how much
do you want?

279
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,100
All right, for
a straight fuck, 220.

280
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
I couldn't pay that.

281
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,200
Well, I'm sorry, then.
It would've been nice.

282
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,300
I'll give you 100.

283
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,700
- No.
- 120.

284
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,600
200.

285
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,000
But only, you know,
because this is your first time.

286
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,500
- I know.
- Because we split with them,

287
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,300
- you understand.
- I understand.

288
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,000
All right, 200.

289
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,200
- Thank you. I appreciate this.
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,300
Would it offend you
if I wore a rubber?

291
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,100
- Not at all.
- Do you... do you have one?

292
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,300
Yes.

293
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,100
Do you want to
pay me now?

294
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,500
Yes, certainly.

295
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
I need cash, honey.

296
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,500
- They said at the door...
- You have to pay me with cash.

297
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,200
- I don't think I have it, but...
- Well, how much do you have?

298
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,300
Well, I, um...
only 60.

299
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,700
Oh! Jeez.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't do it.

300
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Well... well, wait wait, wait wait wait
wait. Maybe you could... wait!

301
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,200
You know, why don't you go
get it and come back here?

302
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
Well, where could I get it?

303
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
Go to an ATM or a restaurant
and cash a check.

304
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,500
- I'll be here till 4:00.
- I'll... I'll...

305
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,500
um, um...
yes, thank you.

306
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Not at all.

307
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
See?

308
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,300
Here you go.
You can't win if you don't play.

309
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
- You, sir?
- Me?

310
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,300
- You gonna try me again?
- "Again"?

311
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,200
I remember you beat me out that 50
that time with your girlfriend.

312
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,300
- When was this?
- On 14th Street.

313
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,900
- You gonna try me one more time?
- Um...

314
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,500
Play for that 50.
50 gets you 100.

315
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,100
We'll see
who's fast as you was.

316
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,400
Pay on the red, pass to the black.
Where's the queen?

317
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,800
You pick the queen, you win.
Where's the queen?

318
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,100
You put a 50, win 100.
Now, who saw the queen?

319
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,600
- I got her.
- How much?

320
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,100
- Put your money up. How much?
- Uh, I bet 50 bucks.

321
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,900
Put it up.

322
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,000
There.

323
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,200
My man, I'm just
too quick for you today.

324
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
We got two cards left.
Who saw the queen?

325
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,500
We got two cards left.
Pay on the red queen. Who saw her?

326
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,500
- I saw her.
- Aw, shit, man, he too fast for me.

327
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,600
For $50?

328
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
All right, all right.
Put it up.

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,600
- Will you pay me if I win?
- Yes, I will.

330
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,900
If you win.
But you got to win first.

331
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,500
- All I got to do is turn the queen?
- That's all you got to do.

332
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,800
- I'll bet you $50.
- You sure?

333
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,400
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Put it up.

334
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
Now...

335
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
which one
you like?

336
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,700
There.

337
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm sorry, my man.
This time you lose.

338
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,600
Now we even.
Take another shot.

339
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,800
You pick the queen, you win.
I'll bet you another 50.

340
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,400
- Let me see those cards.
- These cards is fine.

341
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,100
- It's you that's slow.
- I want to see those cards.

342
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
These cards are good, my man.
You lost.

343
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
You show me those cards.

344
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,800
You ain't seein' no motherfuckin' cards.
We're playin' a game here.

345
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,900
You lost, man. Get lost.

346
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,200
- You let me see those cards, fella.
- You wanna see these cards?

347
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,600
You wanna see these cards?
Here's your motherfuckin' cards!

348
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,300
Stop!
Stop it!

349
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Hold him, hold him.

350
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,700
Turn around!

351
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,400
See my money
and the cards.

352
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,700
He said...
he said my cards...

353
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on.

354
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,100
Come on!

355
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,800
Oh God.

356
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
I want a room.

357
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,100
- $22.
- I lost my wallet.

358
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,500
- Go to the police.
- You can call up American Express.

359
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
Go to the police.
I don't want to hear about it.

360
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,900
You can call the credit card people.
I-I have insurance.

361
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,100
You can call them yourself.
Right across the hall.

362
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,600
I have no money.

363
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
I'm sure it's
a free call.

364
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,000
Does that phone
require a coin?

365
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm sure I don't know.

366
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,600
You know if it needs a coin
or not to get a dial tone.

367
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,800
You know if it needs a coin,
for Christ's sake.

368
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
You want to live
in that kind of world?

369
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,900
You want to live
in a world like that?

370
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
I've been hurt.
Are you blind?

371
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Would you appreciate it
if I acted this way to you?

372
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,100
I ask you
one simple thing...

373
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,500
does it need a coin?

374
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,200
No. It doesn't
need a coin.

375
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
You make your call

376
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
and then you go
somewhere else!

377
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,300
Please deposit ¢75
for the first three minutes.

378
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,200
What do you get for that?
What is that, 14 or 19?

379
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,800
- 14.
- Yeah? Let me see that.

380
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,600
- How much is that?
- 685.

381
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Why is that?
How old is that? Is that old?

382
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,800
You know how much gold
you got in there?

383
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,000
Feel that.
Just feel that.

384
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,000
- Where is it marked?
- Right there. You want the loupe?

385
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
No no, I can see it.

386
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,100
- What?
- I want to pawn something.

387
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,700
Talk to the man
in back.

388
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,400
- What else you got like this?
- I want to pawn something.

389
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,500
- What?
- My ring.

390
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,400
Take it off.

391
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,800
- It's difficult to take it off.
- Spit on it.

392
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,000
- How much is that?
- 220.

393
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,300
I got it off.

394
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,200
What do you want to do with this?
You want to pawn it?

395
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,800
- Yes, how does that work?
- Is that what you want to do?

396
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,200
Yes. Are there
other things to do?

397
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
What you can do, no.
I mean, if you wanted it appraised

398
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,000
or wanted to sell it,
or if you wanted it to pawn.

399
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,900
- I understand.
- All right?

400
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,700
- How much to get it appraised?
- $5.

401
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,400
- What would you give me if I pawned it?
- How much you want for it?

402
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,900
Whatever it's worth.

403
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,600
You pawn it, all you're
gonna get is approximately...

404
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,100
- you know how this works?
- No.

405
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,600
What you get,
a quarter of the value.

406
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,600
Approximately for one year,
you're paying 12%.

407
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,300
You can redeem your pledge with
the year, you pay the 12% to that time,

408
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,200
plus the amount
of the loan.

409
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,800
- What is my pledge?
- Well, that depends on what it is.

410
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,200
- What do you mean?
- What it is. Do you understand?

411
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,500
No.

412
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,000
Whatever the amount is,
that is your pledge.

413
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,000
- The amount of the loan?
- That's right.

414
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,100
- I understand.
- What are you looking for the ring?

415
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,300
- What's it worth?
- The most I can give you is 120 bucks.

416
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Let me see that knife.

417
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
- I'll take it.
- Good.

418
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
I'll be right back.
Give me the ring.

419
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,800
This is nice.
What are you asking for this?

420
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,100
43 bucks.
40 bucks.

421
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,100
40 bucks.

422
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,000
Why's it
so expensive?

423
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,100
Why is it
so expensive?

424
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,700
No, I'm gonna pass.

425
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
I'll catch ya later.
Thanks.

426
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,800
- Why is the knife so expensive?
- This is survival knife.

427
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,000
GI issue.
World War I.

428
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
- And that is why.
- Survival knife.

429
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,900
- That is correct.
- Is it a good knife?

430
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,600
Is the best knife
money can buy.

431
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
You want it?

432
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,400
What are you lookin' for?

433
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,500
- What?
- What are you looking for?

434
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm not lookin'
for a goddamn thing.

435
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,600
If you're lookin' for
that joint, it's closed.

436
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,800
- What joint?
- That joint you was lookin' for.

437
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,900
Thanks, no, I'm not
lookin' for that joint.

438
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,300
Well, you lookin' for somethin', and I
think I know what you lookin' for.

439
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
- You do?
- Yeah, you come with me.

440
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I get you what you want.

441
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,800
What am I looking for?

442
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,300
I know. We'll get you
some action, my friend.

443
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,700
We'll get you something sweet to shoot
on. I know. That's what I'm doin' here.

444
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,500
What are you saying?

445
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I'm sayin' we gonna
find you somethin' nice.

446
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,400
You're saying you're
gonna find me a woman?

447
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,800
That's what I'm doin'
out here, friend.

448
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
- How much?
- Well, how much you want?

449
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,700
- I want somebody clean.
- That's right.

450
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,600
- I want a blowjob.
- All right.

451
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,500
- How much?
- 100 bucks.

452
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
- That's too much.
- Well, how much you wanna spend?

453
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,700
- Say, $35.
- 60.

454
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,900
No. 40?

455
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,800
- Yes.
- Is that all right?

456
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,300
Give me the 40.

457
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,700
I'll give you the 40
when we see the girl.

458
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Hey, I'm not gonna leave you, man.
You comin' with me.

459
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,300
- We goin' to see the girl.
- Good.

460
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
I'll give it to you then.

461
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,000
You give it to me now, man,
you understand?

462
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,100
That's the transaction.
You see,

463
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,500
unless you a cop, you give me the money,
then that's entrapment, you understand?

464
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,300
- Yes. I'm not a cop.
- All right. You see what I'm sayin'?

465
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,900
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

466
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,900
Now, you come with me,
we'll walk here like we're talkin'.

467
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,300
- Is she going to be clean?
- Yes, she is.

468
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,200
I understand you, man.

469
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,900
I understand what you want.
Believe me.

470
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,600
- Is there any money in this?
- Oh, well, man, you know, there's some.

471
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,500
You get done piecin' off
the police,

472
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,700
this man here, the medical,
the bills, you know.

473
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,000
- How much does the girl get?
- 60%. Oh, yeah.

474
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,200
Uh, it's right
up here.

475
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,400
All right, motherfucker, now give me
all your money! All of it! Now!

476
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
- All right.
- Don't turn around. Don't turn around!

477
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,100
- Just hand me all you've got.
- All right.

478
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,000
Don't you make
a motherfuckin' sound.

479
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm gonna do
everything you say.

480
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,600
You just hand me
all you've got.

481
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,300
You motherfucking nigger!

482
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,600
Hold on!

483
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,200
Motherfucking shit!

484
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,400
Jungle bunny!

485
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,600
You coon! You cunt!
You cocksucker!

486
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
- Take me upstairs?!
- Oh my God?

487
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,500
You fuck!
You nigger!

488
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,700
You dumb cunt!

489
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,000
You shit! Shit!
You fucking nigger!

490
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,400
Don't fuck with me,
you coon!

491
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
I hope you're dead!

492
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I want a cup of coffee.
No. A beer.

493
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,300
- Irish whiskey.
- Irish whiskey?

494
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,200
Yes. A double.
Huh. Beer chaser.

495
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,800
- You're in a peppy mood today.
- You're goddamn right I am.

496
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,300
And do you know why?
Because I am alive.

497
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
You know how much
of our life we're alive,

498
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,500
you and I? Nothing!
Two minutes out of the year.

499
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,400
When we meet someone new.
When we get married.

500
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,700
When... when... when...
when we're in difficulties.

501
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
In a car crash.
And that's it.

502
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,400
You know... you know,
we're sheltered.

503
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
- Who is?
- You and I. White people.

504
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,200
All of us.
All of us.

505
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,600
The white race is doomed.
And do you know why?

506
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,700
- Sit down.
- I can't, I'm working.

507
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,000
You can do anything you want to do. You
don't sit down 'cause you're working.

508
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,300
The reason you don't
sit down is you don't want to sit down,

509
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,700
because it's more comfortable
to accept a law

510
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,300
than question it
and live your life.

511
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,000
All of us. We've bred the life
out of ourselves!

512
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,500
We live in a fog.
We live in a dream.

513
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,000
And we are dead.
How old are you?

514
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,900
23.

515
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,000
I've lived
in a fog 47 years.

516
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Most of the life
I have to live, it's gone.

517
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,500
I wasted it
because I didn't know.

518
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,400
And you know what
the answer is?

519
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,100
To live.

520
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,200
That's it.

521
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,100
In one moment,
for which I thank God.

522
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,700
To live!

523
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
I want to
tell you something.

524
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,100
No one's going to know.
Just you. That's all.

525
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,000
No one's keeping score,
and no one cares.

526
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,300
- I want to go home with you tonight.
- Why?

527
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,900
Why do you think?
I want to fuck you.

528
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,900
It's as simple as that.

529
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
- What's your name?
- Glenna.

530
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,400
You see this?

531
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,600
- Yes.
- That fuckin' nigger comes up to me,

532
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,100
"Gimme all your money."
47 years fits me to sweat and say,

533
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,600
"He's underpaid.
He can't get a job.

534
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,900
He's bigger than me.
He's a killer."

535
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,400
He don't care about his life...
you understand? so he'd do anything.

536
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,400
That's what
I'm fitted to do.

537
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,800
In a mess
of intellectuality

538
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,200
to wet my pants
while this coon

539
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,100
cuts my dick off, huh?

540
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,800
Because I'm taught
to hate.

541
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I want to
tell you something.

542
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,600
Something spoke to me.
I got a shock.

543
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I spoke back to him,
that motherfucker!

544
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,900
I came out there with my knife,
and I stuck it in his neck!

545
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,300
Up your ass, you coon!
You wanna fight?

546
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,700
I'll fight you!
I'll cut your fuckin' heart out!

547
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,800
- I don't give a fuck!
- Yes?

548
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,400
Huh? I don't give a fuck.
I got some warlike blood

549
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,200
in my veins too,
ya fuckin' spade!

550
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,100
- The blood ran down his neck.
- With that?

551
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,300
You bet your ass.

552
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,500
- Did you kill him?
- Did I kill him?

553
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,900
- Yes.
- I don't care.

554
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,200
That's wonderful.

555
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,700
And in that moment,
when I spoke...

556
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,600
you understand, 'cause that was
more important than the knife...

557
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,800
I didn't fucking want to understand.
Let him understand me.

558
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,700
I wanted to kill him,
and in that moment,

559
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,400
47 years of prejudice
came out of me,

560
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,100
47 years of all those...

561
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,000
um, uh, uh...

562
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,200
- of all those cleaning ladies...
- Uh-huh.

563
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,700
...um, who-who might
have broke the lamp.

564
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,700
So what? I swear to God,
for the first time I saw

565
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,600
they're people too!

566
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,700
- You know who I hate?
- No, who's that?

567
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,200
- Faggots.
- Yes, I hate them too. Do you know why?

568
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,100
- Why?
- They suck cock.

569
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,000
And that's the truest thing
you'll ever hear.

570
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
I hate them because
they don't like women.

571
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,000
- They hate women.
- I know that they do.

572
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,300
- It feels good to say it, doesn't it?
- Yes.

573
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,500
Then say it.
Say it.

574
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,500
If it makes you feel whole,
always say it, always, for yourself.

575
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,700
- It's hard.
- Yes.

576
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,600
- Sometimes it's hard.
- You're goddamn right it's hard.

577
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,800
And there's a reason
why it's hard.

578
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,500
- Why?
- So that we will stand up.

579
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Glenna,
there is no law.

580
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,700
There is no history.
There's only now.

581
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,100
And if there's a God, he may love
the weak, Glenna,

582
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,600
but he respects
the strong.

583
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,600
And if you are a man,
you should be feared.

584
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,900
You must know
you command respect.

585
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,300
- That's why I love the theater.
- Yes.

586
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,800
Because what you must ask
respect for is yourself.

587
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,500
- What do you mean?
- When you're on stage.

588
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,000
- Yes.
- For your feelings.

589
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,100
- Absolutely! Absolutely, yes!
- And-and not be someone else!

590
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Why should you?

591
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,300
That's why I'm so proud
to be in this profession.

592
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,100
- I don't blame you.
- Because your aspirations...

593
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,900
And I'll bet you're good at it.
They have no bounds.

594
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,800
There's nothing to bound
you but your soul!

595
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,000
I understand.

596
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,200
- Do something for me.
- Uh...

597
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,500
Act something for me.

598
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,400
- Will you act something for me?
- Now?

599
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,300
- Yes.
- Sitting right here?

600
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,100
- Yes!
- Would you really like me to?

601
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,500
You know I would.
You see me sitting here.

602
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,100
- You know I would. I'd love you to!
- You want one?

603
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,000
- Nah.
- What would you like me to do?

604
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,200
Whatever you'd like.
What plays have you done?

605
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Well, we've
only done scenes.

606
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
- You've only done scenes?
- I shouldn't say "only."

607
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,900
- They contain the kernel of the play.
- What plays have you done?

608
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,200
- In college, I played Juliet.
- In Shakespeare?

609
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,700
Yes, in Shakespeare.
What do you think?

610
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,200
Well, I just meant
there's-there's plays named "Juliet."

611
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,900
- There are?
- Yes.

612
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,100
- I don't think so.
- Well, there are.

613
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,900
Don't-don't-don't
be so limited

614
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,100
and don't assume I'm dumb
because I wear a suit and tie.

615
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,300
I don't assume that.

616
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,800
Because what we've done
tonight, since you met me...

617
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
it didn't make
a difference then.

618
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,700
Forget it.
All-all I meant, um...

619
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
- You say you're an actress.
- I am an actress.

620
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,500
Yes, that's what you say, so I say,
"What plays have you done?" That's all.

621
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,700
The work I've done,
I've done for my peers.

622
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,500
- What does that mean?
- In class.

623
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,300
- "In class"?
- In class or workshop.

624
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,600
Not for a paying group?

625
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,100
- No, absolutely not.
- Then you're not an actress.

626
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,700
Face it.

627
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,500
Let's start right,
the two of us.

628
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm not lying to you, don't lie to me
and don't lie to yourself.

629
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,000
You are a beautiful woman.
You have worlds before you. I do too.

630
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,500
What I'm saying, start now,
start tonight, with me.

631
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,400
- Be what you are.
- I am what I am.

632
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
That is
absolutely right,

633
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
and that's what I loved
when I saw you tonight.

634
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,800
What I loved.
I use that word.

635
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
I loved a woman,
standing there...

636
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,500
a working woman
who brought life to what she did,

637
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,400
who took a moment
to joke with me!

638
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,300
That's... God bless
what you are!

639
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
Say it.
"I am a waitress!"

640
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,100
- Say it.
- What does it mean if I say something?

641
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,000
- Say it with me!
- What?

642
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,400
- "I am a waitress!"
- I think that you'd better go.

643
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,000
If you want me
to go, I'll go.

644
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,000
Say it with me... what you are.
And I'll say what I am.

645
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,100
Say what you are,
and I'll say what I am.

646
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,400
- What you are?
- I've made that discovery.

647
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,700
Now, I want you to
change your life with me!

648
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,600
Right now!
For whatever that it can be!

649
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,500
I don't know what that is;
you don't know.

650
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,600
Speak with me, right now!
Say it!

651
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,100
I don't know what
you're talking about!

652
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,800
Oh, but the Lord, yes you do.

653
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Say it with me!

654
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,300
- What are those?
- Pills.

655
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,700
For what? Don't take them.
Go through it with me!

656
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,800
- I have this tendency to get anxious.
- Don't take them!

657
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,200
Go through it!
Go through it with me!

658
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,300
- You're scaring me!
- I am not!

659
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,300
I know when I'm scaring you,
believe me.

660
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,400
- Get out!
- Glenna!

661
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

662
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,300
Leave me the fuck alone!
What did I do, pledge my life to you?

663
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,600
I let you fuck me!
Go away!

664
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,800
Listen to me.
You know what madness is?

665
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
- I told you, go away!
- Listen to me.

666
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,200
Lis...
I'm lonely too.

667
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
I know what it is too,
believe me.

668
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,100
- You know what madness is?
- Suzy?

669
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,600
- It's self-indulgence.
- Suze, can you come over here?

670
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,100
Will you please put that down!
Do you know how rare this is?

671
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,900
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't be ridiculous.

672
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,800
- I'm talking to you!
- Don't hurt me!

673
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
I... no no, I can't deal with this.

674
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,800
- You're being ridiculous!
- I... no no. Help! Help!

675
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,100
- Would you shut the fuck up?
- Help!

676
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,000
What are you trying
to do, for God's sake?

677
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,400
- Help!
- You wanna wake the neighbors?

678
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,600
- Will somebody help me?
- Shut up!

679
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,500
- Help!
- Shut up!

680
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,400
Will somebody help?
You get away from me! You are the devil!

681
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,500
I know who you are! I know what you want
me to do! Get away from me!

682
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
- I curse you! Get away from me!
- You shut the fuck up!

683
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,300
- You can't kill me! I'm good!
- You stupid fucking bitch!

684
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,900
- No!
- You're nuts! Are you insane?

685
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,200
Are you insane?
You fucking bitch!

686
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,600
You stupid fucking bitch!

687
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,700
You stupid fucking...

688
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,500
Now look
what you've done.

689
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,100
Now look what you've
bloody fucking done.

690
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,700
My mother had
a hat like that.

691
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,200
My mother had
a hat like that.

692
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
I'm not making
conversation.

693
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,700
She wore it for years.
She wore it when I was a child.

694
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,300
I didn't just
make it up.

695
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,100
- It happened.
- Excuse me.

696
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,800
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm talking to you!

697
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
What am I, a stone?
Did I say, "I want to lick your pussy"?

698
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,900
I said my mother
had that same hat!

699
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,500
You cunt!
What am I, a dog?

700
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,900
I'd like to slash
your fucking face!

701
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,800
I'd like to slash your
motherfucking face apart!

702
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,500
- Will somebody help me?
- You don't know who I am!

703
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,800
Is everybody
in this town insane?

704
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,300
Fuck you! Fuck you!

705
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,900
Fuck you!
Fuck the lot of you!

706
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,200
Fuck you all!
I don't need you!

707
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,600
I worked all my life!

708
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,900
I worked all my life!

709
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
I worked all my life.

710
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,500
Folks...

711
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,500
You say,
"Oh, no, not me.

712
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,000
Not me, Lord, to whom
you hold out Your hand.

713
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,500
Not me to whom You offer
Your eternal grace.

714
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,600
Not me who can be saved."

715
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,100
But who but you, I ask?

716
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,600
Who but you?

717
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,600
You say you are
a grievous sinner?

718
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,900
He knows that you are!

719
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,300
You say, "He does not know
the depth of my iniquity."

720
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,400
Believe me, friends,
He does.

721
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,600
And still you say

722
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,700
He does not know.

723
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,200
You say this
in your secret soul.

724
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,200
"He does not know
the terrible depth of my unbelief."

725
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,500
Believe me, friends,
He knows that too.

726
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,000
To all of you
who say His grace

727
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,200
is not meant to extend
to one as black as you,

728
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,500
I say, "Who but you?"

729
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,400
To you alone.

730
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
Not to the blessed.

731
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,400
You think that Christ
died for the blessed?

732
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,500
That He died for
the heavenly host?

733
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,100
That did not make Him God!

734
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,200
It does not need a God.

735
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,800
For you!

736
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,800
There is none so black

737
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,600
but that He died for you.

738
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,400
It's required of God
to sacrifice for man.

739
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,800
You hear me?

740
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,800
For you!

741
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,600
He died
especially for you.

742
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,900
Upon my life,

743
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,500
on the graves
of my family,

744
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,600
and by the surety

745
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,000
I have of
his eternal bliss.

746
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,500
He died for you,
and you are saved!

747
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,700
Praise God, my friends!

748
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,800
Praise God and testify.

749
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,000
Who will come up
and testify with me, my friends?

750
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,100
Who will come up
and testify?

751
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,200
Who will testify
for Jesus?

752
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,100
Who will testify with me?

753
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,200
I will testify.

754
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,900
Who is that?

755
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,000
I will testify!

756
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,800
- Sweet God, let that man come forth!
- Let him forward.

757
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,600
That's the man.
That's the man.

758
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,700
Who will come
open up his soul?

759
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,700
Hallelujah, my friends!
Be with me!

760
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,100
That's the man!
That's the man!

761
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,500
Get him now!
That's him! Stop him!

762
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,900
Where is that man?
Let him come forth!

763
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,300
- Just a minute, sir.
- I-I-I'm on my way to church.

764
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,200
Sweet Jesus,
let that man come forth!

765
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,900
That's the man that tried
to rape me on the train!

766
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,500
- Rape?
- Rape?

767
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
What's this
all about, sir?

768
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,900
- He had a knife!
- Must be some mistake.

769
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,900
He tried to rape me. That's the man
who tried to rape me on the train!

770
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,300
There's some mistake.

771
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,000
- I'm on my way to church.
- What's the trouble here?

772
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,800
No problem.
I'm on my way into this mission.

773
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,300
This man tried
to rape me on the train!

774
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,300
Obviously
the woman is mad.

775
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,700
Can I see some
identification, please?

776
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,300
Please, officer,
I-I haven't time.

777
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,200
It's been a long...

778
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,100
I don't have
my wallet on me.

779
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,900
My name is
Gregory Burke.

780
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,200
I live
at 42822nd Street.

781
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,200
I own the building.
I have to... preach.

782
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,300
- You're gonna want to show me some ID.
- I don't have any, I told you.

783
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,800
Well, you're gonna
have to come with me.

784
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900
Yes, but in one moment.

785
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,000
- Not now. I have to preach.
- Come on.

786
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,100
Please.
You're making a mistake.

787
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,600
Let me go, and I'll-I'll
come with you afterwards.

788
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,300
I swear I will.
I swear it on my life.

789
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,000
There's been, uh,
some sort of a mistake.

790
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,500
I'm an elder
in this church.

791
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,300
Come with me, if you will.
I have to speak.

792
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,000
Look...

793
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
- What's that?
- Nothing.

794
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,400
It's a knife.
It's there for self-protection.

795
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,600
What was the knife for?

796
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,800
- For protection.
- From whom?

797
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,600
Everyone.

798
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,700
- You know that it's illegal?
- No.

799
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,000
- It is.
- I'm sorry.

800
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,200
Speaking to that woman in the way
you did is construed as assault.

801
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,500
I never spoke to her.

802
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,800
She identified you as the man
who accosted her last evening.

803
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,800
She is
seriously mistaken.

804
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,500
If she presses charges, you'll
be arraigned for assault.

805
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,000
For speaking to her?

806
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,600
You admit that
you were speaking to her?

807
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,600
I want to
ask you something.

808
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,600
- All right.
- Did you ever kick a dog?

809
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,400
Well, that's what I did.

810
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
Man to man,
that's what I did.

811
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,500
I made a simple,
harmless comment to her.

812
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,600
she responded like
a fucking bitch!

813
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,500
- Did you try to pick her up?
- Why would I try to pick her up?

814
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,300
- She was an attractive woman.
- She was not an attractive woman.

815
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,400
- You gay?
- What business is that of yours?

816
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,300
- Are you?
- No!

817
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,600
- You married?
- Yes, in fact.

818
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,800
I was going back to my wife.

819
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,800
- You were going back to your wife?
- I was... going home to her.

820
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,100
You said you were going back to her.
What did you mean?

821
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,900
I'd left my wife,
all right?

822
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
- You left your wife?
- Yes.

823
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,400
Why?

824
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,500
I was bored.

825
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,600
Didn't that ever
happen to you?

826
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,200
- And why did you lie to the officer?
- What officer?

827
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,100
Who picked you up. There's no Gregory
Burke at the address you gave.

828
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
You didn't give him
your right name.

829
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,000
- I was embarrassed.
- Why?

830
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,700
- I didn't have my wallet.
- Why?

831
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,900
- I'd left it at home.
- Why did that embarrass you?

832
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,700
I don't know!
I have had no sleep!

833
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,700
I just want to go home!

834
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,700
I am a solid...

835
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Look,

836
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,900
my name is
Edmond Burke.

837
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
I live
at 485 West 79th Street.

838
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,400
I work at Stearns
& Harrington.

839
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,400
I had a tiff with my wife.
I went out on the town.

840
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,600
I've learned my lesson.
Believe me. I just want to go home.

841
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,600
Whatever I've done,
I'll make right.

842
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,600
All right?

843
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,300
All right?

844
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,700
These things happen,
and then they're done.

845
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,900
When you stopped me,
I was going to church.

846
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,100
I've been... unwell.

847
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,900
I confess to you,
I've...

848
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,200
been confused, but...

849
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,300
I've learned my lesson,
I'm ready to go home.

850
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,300
Why'd you kill
that girl?

851
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,600
What girl?

852
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,800
That girl you killed.

853
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,100
- How's everything?
- Fine.

854
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,500
- I'm all right too.
- Oh, good.

855
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,900
You wanna tell me
you're mad at me or something?

856
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,600
Did you kill that girl
in her apartment?

857
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Yes. But I want to
tell you something.

858
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,700
I didn't mean to.
But you wanna hear something funny?

859
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,700
Now, don't laugh.

860
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,600
I think I just had
too much coffee.

861
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,000
I'll tell you
something else.

862
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I think there are just too many people
in the world.

863
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,900
I think that's why
we kill each other.

864
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,600
I-I-I suppose

865
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,300
you're mad at me
for leaving you.

866
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,600
I don't suppose you're,
um, inclined...

867
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
or nor do I
think you should be...

868
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,700
to stand by me.

869
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,500
I-I-I understand that.

870
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,000
I'm sure
there are marriages

871
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
where the wife would,

872
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,800
or the husband,
if it would go that way.

873
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,300
But, I-I know ours is

874
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,700
not one of that type.

875
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,400
I know you wished
at one point it would.

876
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,400
I wished that too,
at one point.

877
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,300
I know...

878
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,400
I'm sure this is how you feel when
someone near you dies.

879
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,400
You never said the things you wanted
desperately to say.

880
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,400
It would have been
so simple to say them,

881
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,200
but you never did.

882
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,000
- You got the papers?
- Yes.

883
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,500
- Good.
- Oh, yes, I got them.

884
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,600
Anything you need?

885
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,500
Nope.

886
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,000
Can't think of a thing.

887
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
You take care now.

888
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,800
You know...
you know... you know...

889
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,900
you know, we can't distinguish
between anxiety and fear.

890
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,900
You know what I mean?

891
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I don't mean fear.
I mean...

892
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,800
I do mean fear.
I don't mean anxiety.

893
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,800
We... when we fear
something,

894
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,700
I think
we wish for it.

895
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,400
Death.
Or burglars.

896
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,700
Don't you think?

897
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,400
I always knew
I would end up here.

898
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
Every fear hides a wish.

899
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,900
I think I'm gonna
like it here.

900
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,900
- You do?
- I do. You know why?

901
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,400
It's simple.
That's why I think I am.

902
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,200
You know, I always thought
white people should be in prison.

903
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,100
I know it's the black race
we keep there,

904
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,500
but I always thought white people
should be there. You-you know why?

905
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,200
- Why?
- To be with the black people.

906
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,600
Does that sound
too simple to you?

907
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,400
- No.
- Because we're lonely.

908
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,800
But what I know...
what I know...

909
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,600
I think all this fear,

910
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,300
all this fucking fear we feel
must hide a wish.

911
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,400
'Cause I don't feel it
since I'm here.

912
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,600
I don't. I think for
the first time in my life.

913
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,000
I think we're like birds. We suspect
when there's going to be an earthquake.

914
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,400
Birds know. They leave
three days earlier.

915
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,200
Birds leave when there's
gonna be an earthquake?

916
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,300
Yes.

917
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,100
And I think,
in our soul, we feel...

918
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,600
we sense
there's going to be...

919
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
Uh-huh?

920
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
...a cataclysm.

921
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,700
But we cannot flee.

922
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,000
Something tells us,
"Get outta here!"

923
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,700
White people feel that.
You feel that?

924
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Well... but I don't feel it
since I'm here.

925
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,800
So... so... so...

926
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,700
I must be somewhere safe.
Isn't that funny?

927
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,700
No.

928
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,200
- You think that it's not?
- Yes.

929
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,300
Thank you.

930
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,800
- That's all right.
- Huh.

931
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,100
- You want a cigarette?
- No, thank you. Not just now.

932
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,800
That's all right.

933
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,700
- Maybe later.
- Sure.

934
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,100
- Now you know what?
- What?

935
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,000
I think you just
get on my body.

936
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,600
I... yes.

937
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,100
What do you mean?

938
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,700
I think you get
on my body. Now.

939
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,900
- I don't know what that means.
- It means you should suck my dick.

940
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,100
Now, don't you
wanna do that?

941
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,500
No.

942
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,100
Well, you just
do it anyway.

943
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,000
You're joking.

944
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,900
Not at all.

945
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,200
- I don't think I could do that.
- Well, you better try.

946
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,900
Or you're gonna die.

947
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,900
Let's just get this
out the way.

948
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I...

949
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,200
Seriously, we're gonna
be here a long time.

950
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,200
I don't think we want
to start like this.

951
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,000
I'm not gonna
repeat myself.

952
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,400
I'll scream.

953
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,700
If you scream,
you'll offend me,

954
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,800
you gonna die.

955
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,700
Look at my face.
Say I'm foolin'.

956
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,100
I-I-I-I can't.
I can't do...

957
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,900
The motherfuck
you can't, missy!

958
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,300
Right now, missy!
Right now, Jim,

959
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,700
and you'd best be nice.

960
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,800
You don't have to talk.

961
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,700
I don't want to talk.

962
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,100
Are you accustomed
to life in here?

963
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,900
Do you know
what happened to me?

964
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,700
- No.
- I was sodomized.

965
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
- Did you report it?
- Yes.

966
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,200
- What did they say?
- "That happens."

967
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,700
I'm sorry
it happened to you.

968
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,000
Thank you.

969
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,300
Are you lonely?

970
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,400
Yes.

971
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,300
Yes.

972
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,000
- I feel so alone.
- Shh.

973
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,900
I'm so... empty.

974
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,500
Maybe you are ready
to be filled.

975
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,600
That's bullshit.

976
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,600
It's bullshit.
It's pious bullshit.

977
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,700
- Is it?
- Yes!

978
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,700
That you are ready to be filled?
Is it impossible?

979
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,800
Yes. Yes!

980
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,000
I don't know
what's impossible.

981
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,300
- Nothing's impossible.
- Oh!

982
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,200
Nothing is impossible, not to God.
Is that what you're saying?

983
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,400
- Yes.
- Then you're full of shit!

984
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,200
You understand that?

985
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
If nothing is
impossible to God,

986
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,700
then let Him let me
walk out of here!

987
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,800
And be free!

988
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,300
Let Him cause a new day,
in a perfect land,

989
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,500
full of life and air,

990
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,600
where people are
kind to each other!

991
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,700
And there's work to do!

992
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:29,100
Where we grow up
in love and in security;

993
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,900
We're wanted.
Let Him do that.

994
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,300
Go on.
Let him do that, you asshole,

995
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,500
if nothing is
impossible to God.

996
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,400
I think that must be easy.
Not "Let me fly,"

997
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,200
or "If there is a God, make him to make
the sun come out at night."

998
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,800
Go on. Please.

999
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,600
Please!
Please!

1000
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,600
I'm begging you!
I'm begging you!

1001
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,900
If you're so smart,
let him do that!

1002
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,900
Please! Please!
I'm begging you!

1003
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,900
Are you sorry that
you killed that girl?

1004
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,400
- Edmond?
- Yes.

1005
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,400
Are you sorry that
you killed that girl?

1006
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,800
I'm sorry
about everything.

1007
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,800
But are you sorry
that you killed?

1008
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,500
Yes.

1009
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,400
Yes, I am.

1010
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,400
Yes.

1011
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,300
Why did you kill
that girl?

1012
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,100
I... don't...

1013
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,400
I...

1014
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,600
I don't...

1015
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,700
I don't think...

1016
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,100
I don't...

1017
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,600
I...

1018
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,600
I don't...

1019
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,800
"Dear Mrs. Brown.

1020
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,800
You don't remember me.
Perhaps you do.

1021
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,300
Do you remember Eddie Burke,
who lived on Euclid?

1022
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,200
Maybe you do.

1023
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,700
I took Debbie
to the prom.

1024
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,600
I know that she never
found me attractive,

1025
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,500
and I think perhaps
she was coerced

1026
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,900
in some way
to go with me,

1027
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,900
though I can't think
in what way.

1028
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,600
It also strikes me
as I write

1029
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,100
that maybe she went
of her own free will,

1030
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:40,500
and I found it important
to think that she went unwillingly.

1031
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,700
I don't think, however,
this is true.

1032
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,900
She was a lovely girl,
and I'm sure if you remember me,

1033
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,500
you will recall how taken
I was with her then."

1034
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,600
You have a visitor.

1035
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,800
You have a visitor.

1036
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,500
Please tell him
I'm ill.

1037
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,100
You can't control what
you make of your life.

1038
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,500
Now, that's
for damn sure.

1039
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,000
There's a destiny
that shapes our ends.

1040
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,800
- Mm-hmm.
- Rough-hew them how we may.

1041
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,500
However the motherfuck
we may.

1042
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,000
- And that's the truth.
- You know that is the truth.

1043
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,300
And people say it's hereditary
or it's environment,

1044
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,100
but I think
it's somethin' else.

1045
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,500
- What do you think it is?
- I think it's something beyond that.

1046
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,200
- Mm-hmm.
- Beyond these things that we can know.

1047
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,000
I think maybe in dreams
we see what it is.

1048
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,900
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

1049
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,700
I don't think
we can know.

1050
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,600
- I think if we knew it, we'd be dead.
- We'd be God.

1051
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,800
We would be God.
That is absolutely right.

1052
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,800
- Or-or some genius.
- No.

1053
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,500
I don't think even genius
can know what it is.

1054
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,900
No, some great genius.
Or some philosopher.

1055
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,700
I don't think even genius
can see what we are.

1056
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,300
- You don't think that...
- I think that we can't perceive it.

1057
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,800
Well, something's goin' on,
I'll tell you that.

1058
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,400
And somewhere, some poor sucker
knows what's happenin'.

1059
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,200
- Do you think?
- Shit, yeah.

1060
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,700
Some whacked-out
sucker somewhere...

1061
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,600
in the Ozarks.

1062
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,300
Shit, yes.
Some guy.

1063
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,100
Some inbred sucker walks
around all day, just...

1064
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,500
- You think?
- Yeah.

1065
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,800
Well, maybe not
him, but...

1066
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,800
somewhere, some guy.

1067
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Some fuck locked up
has got time for reflection.

1068
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,600
Mmm.

1069
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,000
Or some fuckin'... I don't know...
some kid who's just been born.

1070
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,100
Some kid that's
just been born.

1071
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,600
And you know he's got no
preconceptions. All he's...

1072
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,000
- Yes, absolutely right.
- Huh?

1073
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,600
Yes. Maybe it's memory.

1074
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,700
That's what I'm sayin'.
Now, just maybe...

1075
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,400
It could be,
or some knowledge.

1076
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,300
- Some intuition.
- Yes!

1077
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,300
I don't even mean intuition.
Something... something...

1078
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,900
- Or maybe some animal.
- Why not?

1079
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,400
See now, that's the whole
time when they say,

1080
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,400
"We'll just wait
for the men from space."

1081
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,300
- Maybe they're already here.
- Maybe they are.

1082
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,500
Maybe they're animals
that were left here.

1083
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,800
- Yes. Eons ago.
- Long ago.

1084
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,900
And have been
bred here.

1085
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,900
Or maybe we're
the animals.

1086
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,800
Maybe we are.

1087
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,700
You know how they...
they are

1088
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,300
- supreme on their...
- Yes.

1089
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,000
- on their native world.
- But when you put them here...

1090
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,200
- We call them dogs.
- Uh-huh.

1091
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Or animals.
And we scorn them.

1092
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,200
- Yes.
- We scorn them in our fear.

1093
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:06,300
- But don't you think...
- It very well could be.

1094
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,400
- But on their native world...
- Uh-huh.

1095
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,400
...they are supreme.
- I think that's very...

1096
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,700
And what we have done
is to disgrace ourselves.

1097
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
We have.

1098
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,300
Because we did not
treat them with respect.

1099
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,900
- Maybe we were the animals.
- That's what I'm saying.

1100
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,800
Maybe they're here

1101
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,100
to watch over us.

1102
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,300
Maybe that's
why they're here.

1103
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,900
Or to observe us.

1104
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,400
Maybe we're here
to be punished.

1105
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,700
You think
there's a hell?

1106
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,600
I don't know.

1107
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,500
I don't know.

1108
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,300
You think we're there?

1109
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,400
I don't know, man.

1110
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,000
Think we go somewhere
when we die?

1111
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't know, man.

1112
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,400
I like to think so.

1113
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,500
- I do too.
- I sure do like to think so.

1114
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,700
Perhaps it's heaven.

1115
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,800
I don't know, man.

1116
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,800
I don't know either.

1117
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,100
But perhaps it is.

1118
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,500
I would like
to think so.

1119
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,000
I would too.

1120
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

1121
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,900
# Lord #

1122
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,700
# My Lord #

1123
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:39,700
- # Oh my Lord #
- # My Lord #

1124
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,300
# Oh my Lord #

# Oh my Lord #

1127
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:59,900
- # Oh my Lord #
- # Oh my Lord, Oh my Lord #

1128
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,700
# Oh my Lord
is coming #

1129
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:09,000
# Oh my Lord
is coming home #

1130
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:14,800
# Oh my Lord,
I'm coming #

01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,800
# Oh my Lord,
I'm coming home #

1132
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:25,000
- # Oh my Lord is coming #
- # Oh, He sure is #

1133
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,400
# Oh my Lord,
He called me home #

1134
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,200
# I said he's coming home #

1135
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:34,000
# Oh my Lord,
I'm coming #

1136
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:38,100
# Oh my Lord,
I'm coming home #

1137
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,900

- # My Lord #

# Oh my Lord #

1139
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:54,100
# I is coming home. #
