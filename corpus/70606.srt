1
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,039
- Yes, I'm still on hold.
- And what was this?

2
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:40,237
I'm looking at your advertisement
for the airline giveaway.

3
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,973
Our frequent flyer plan.

4
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,586
It's hard to understand
because it says, "In addition to"...

5
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:51,123
...but I can't understand in addition
to what? There's nothing to add it to.

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,356
I think that's a typo, then.

7
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,359
Okay, so just to clarify, I'm sorry...

8
00:00:56,564 --> 00:01:00,398
...10 purchases of Healthy Choice
products equals 500 miles.

9
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,265
And with the coupon, the same
purchases value 1000 miles?

10
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:05,530
That's it.

11
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:09,143
Do you realize that
the monetary value of this prize...

12
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:13,337
...is potentially worth more
than the purchases?

13
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,810
I don't know.

14
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:25,114
Could I call you back? Could I ask
you your extension and name?

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,557
It's extension 215,
and the name is Carter.

16
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:31,630
Carter. Thank you very much, Carter.

17
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,495
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

18
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:11,889
- I'm not sure what that means.
- Lf they break, is it plastic?

19
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,761
It's plastic, yeah.

20
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:19,098
But that kind of breakage shouldn't be
a problem in the shipping room.

21
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,673
I'm gonna run the numbers.
l'll give you a call.

22
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:25,404
- You have my home phone number?
- What's that for?

23
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,738
If you wanted to call me.

24
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,008
I'm fine.
I have your work number.

25
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:34,951
Because of the time difference,
if you needed to reach me earlier...

26
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:38,216
No, it's fine. I can just
get you at your office.

27
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,381
- Okay.
- Okay.

28
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,549
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

29
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,956
Bye-bye.

30
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:34,810
- Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
- No.

31
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:38,348
- They're not open yet.
- They don't get open until 8:00.

32
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:41,113
Is it okay if I leave
my car, you think?

33
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't know. I don't know.

34
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,525
I thought they opened at 7.

35
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:50,227
If I left my car, would it be okay?

36
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:52,832
See, I don't know how they do it.

37
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,831
- Do you know them?
- Not very well.

38
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,561
Could I trust to leave
my key with you...

39
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,799
...so when they get here,
you could give it to them?

40
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,740
Okay, sure.

41
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:15,851
- You think it's okay where I've left it?
- It'll be fine. I can watch it.

42
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:19,092
- Thanks a lot.
- L'll keep an eye on it.

43
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:25,732
- There's a piano in the street.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:30,066
Maybe l'll see you later.
Thank you for your help.

45
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:31,364
Thank you.

46
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:35,736
- Maybe l'll see you later.
- Okay.

47
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:04,242
Morning, Barry.

48
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,477
- You okay?
- Yes.

49
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,884
- Why are you wearing a suit?
- I bought one.

50
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:16,826
I thought it'd be nice to get dressed
for work, and I'm not sure why.

51
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,395
- May I please show you something?
- Sure.

52
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,931
What's this?

53
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,374
I believe this is a small piano.

54
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,040
It's not a piano.
I got a piano at home.

55
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,311
Where did you get it?

56
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:44,151
It was dropped in the street.

57
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,389
Why is it here?

58
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,362
Barry?

59
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,232
Barry?

60
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,028
Morning, Barry.

61
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,229
I don't know.

62
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,973
Great product.

63
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:41,603
I have to make sure I don't end
up with extra inventory.

64
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,682
Can you guarantee all your sales?

65
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:50,188
We back our fungers 100%. We ask
for a 30-60 day display on the floor.

66
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:54,588
Barry, your sister's on line one.
Barry, your sister's on line one.

67
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:58,492
I don't think they'll be out
that long. I guarantee that.

68
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,601
Let me just get this, this is my sister.

69
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:04,166
It's not a problem.

70
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:06,033
- This is Barry.
- It's Rhonda.

71
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,903
- Are you going to this party tonight?
- Yes, I am.

72
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:13,445
- All right, fine. Bye.
- Bye-bye. L'll see you tonight.

73
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,008
Sorry about that.

74
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,886
We've received a large order from the
Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

75
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,219
We will be supplying their bathrooms
with the dice and money funger.

76
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:29,157
So these babies are really flying.

77
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,198
Barry, your sister's on line two.
Barry, your sister's on line two.

78
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,928
With the aquablast, little zippers,
whales and speedboats...

79
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:39,504
...we ask the display be at eye level.

80
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:42,767
- Barry.
- Let me just get that.

81
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:46,435
You know, you can also
color-coordinate these fungers.

82
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,582
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing?

83
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:51,114
I have customers. I can't chat now.

84
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:53,878
Chat? Did you just say "chat"?

85
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:58,052
- Yeah, I can't talk...
- You just fucking said "chat. "

86
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,557
What are you now? Chat.

87
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:04,061
I'm calling to make sure you
show up at this party.

88
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:05,789
- L'll be there.
- Okay, fine.

89
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:10,801
Then go back to chatting with your
customers, you phony, chatty shit.

90
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:12,598
All right, thank you.

91
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,768
Sorry about that.

92
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,966
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- I do.

93
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:20,078
I wanted to tell you
about the new fungers.

94
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:24,941
We've been working on this, and we
have a nonbreakable handle, finally.

95
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,849
Let me demonstrate for you.

96
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:33,392
Okay, this was one of the old ones.
Do we have a new one around, Lance?

97
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,291
Sorry about that.
That's a little embarrassing.

98
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:39,625
Barry, your sister's on line four.

99
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,292
- So how many sisters do you have?
- I have seven.

100
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,131
Yes.

101
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,208
They're calling me because
they're having a party tonight.

102
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:52,106
l'll be two more minutes, okay?

103
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,544
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing?

104
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,947
Kathleen. I'm working.

105
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,815
- You going to the party?
- Yes.

106
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,014
- What are you doing?
- I'm working.

107
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,853
Yeah, but what are you doing?

108
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,393
I'm talking on the phone, standing.

109
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:11,656
- What time you gonna be there?
- 7.

110
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,494
- You can't be late. I'm serious.
- I won't.

111
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:18,968
You can't not show up like you do.
You have to go. Seriously.

112
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:22,539
- You can't just stay in your house.
- All right.

113
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,012
- L'll see you there? Don't puss out.
- See you there. Okay.

114
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:10,146
Is her car going to be okay?

115
00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:12,758
- It's fine.
- Thanks.

116
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,230
Barry, it's your sister.

117
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,200
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Elizabeth.

118
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:22,801
- How's it going?
- Great.

119
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,029
- Stopped by to say hello.
- Terrific.

120
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,196
- So you're going tonight?
- Yes.

121
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,739
- Cool.
- You're going?

122
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,936
Yes. I came by to talk to you
about something in particular.

123
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:37,982
There's this friend of mine who's
really cute, and I want you to meet her.

124
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,952
I was thinking about bringing
her tonight. What do you think?

125
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:45,751
Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

126
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,123
- Why?
- I just don't do stuff like that.

127
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,764
Well, you don't really do anything.

128
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,332
Everybody would be looking at me.

129
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,231
What's wrong with looking?
It's a free country.

130
00:14:57,404 --> 00:15:02,774
I just feel like I'd be a little tense,
and I don't think I'd act like myself.

131
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,344
Well, that's kind of your fault.

132
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:12,877
There's an outside chance
I'm not even coming tonight.

133
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,917
Really? Didn't you tell everybody
you were coming?

134
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:21,583
I have to renew
my gym membership.

135
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:25,493
Right. God, well, that
solves everything, actually.

136
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,329
If you're not coming, then I can
bring her. It's not a big deal.

137
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:32,939
Well, it'll be fine. Great.

138
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,167
- Please don't...
- I'm just trying to be your friend.

139
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,642
I hope you can make it.

140
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,248
Remember when Barry
used to get all mad?

141
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,878
Because Rhonda used
to call him "Gay Boy" all the time.

142
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,558
- That's right.
- Remember the sliding glass door?

143
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,285
He threw that hammer
through the door.

144
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:59,523
He got glass in his foot.
Mom took him to the hospital.

145
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,262
He came home and locked himself
in the bathroom with the hammer.

146
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:07,804
- Hey, there he is.
- Hi.

147
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:13,379
We were talking about you. Remember
when we used to call you Gay Boy?

148
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,572
- What?
- We called you Gay Boy.

149
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:18,877
We'd call you Gay Boy,
and you'd just freak out.

150
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:22,783
You got so mad, you threw
the hammer through the glass door.

151
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:24,389
- You remember.
- I don't.

152
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:28,187
Yes, you do. We were calling you
Gay Boy, and you got mad.

153
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,387
Are you gay now?

154
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:32,191
I don't know.

155
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,061
We were trying to figure out
why you had a hammer.

156
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:38,363
- Why are you wearing that suit?
- I don't know.

157
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,029
- I like his suit.
- Thank you.

158
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,040
- Are you using that dandruff shampoo?
- Yes.

159
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,268
- You are?
- Barry?

160
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:48,244
- Why did you have the hammer?
- Why did I have the hammer?

161
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:52,181
- He was building a doghouse.
- Okay, Rhonda.

162
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:55,219
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks for coming.

163
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,381
- A cake. We have a cake.
- You got a cake.

164
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,427
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
Glad you could make it.

165
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:06,828
- Mr. Chatty. Hi, Mr. Chatty.
- You have rice in your hair.

166
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,264
Say hello to your
brother-in-laws.

167
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,428
- Hey, Barry, how you doing?
- How you doing, pal?

168
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,199
- Good to see you.
- Saw your car. Snazzy.

169
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,867
- Hey, Barry, how you doing?
- I'm sorry!

170
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,570
- How you doing?
- How is it going?

171
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,214
How's work?

172
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:26,409
- Business is very food, thank you.
- What's very food?

173
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,818
- What's that?
- You just said "very food."

174
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,255
I'm sorry, I meant to say
"very good."

175
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,453
Maybe you said "food"
because you're hungry.

176
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,963
- You know, you want to eat.
- That makes sense.

177
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:46,236
Is your friend here?

178
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:49,273
No. You're off the hook.
She couldn't make it.

179
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,536
Thank you.

180
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,904
- You nervous?
- No.

181
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,982
- You look nervous.
- I feel very happy.

182
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,313
Good. Did you get
your gym membership?

183
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,114
Tomorrow.

184
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,027
I had a girl I was gonna bring
for Barry. He wouldn't let me do it.

185
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:12,393
I had this girl to bring for him.
She's awesome. We work together.

186
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:16,229
- He said he couldn't be himself.
- Gay Boy, it's time to eat.

187
00:18:16,403 --> 00:18:18,530
- Who's he going to be?
- I don't know.

188
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:21,435
He's worried we'll give him
a bunch of shit.

189
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:24,372
He said he wouldn't come
if I brought her.

190
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:27,274
He's an asshole.
Why do you listen to him?

191
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:32,214
I don't know. I was gonna bring her.
It would've been totally casual.

192
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:34,411
Look at him.

193
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:43,920
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You fucking retard, Barry!

194
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:53,704
I'm sorry about that.
Sorry about what I did.

195
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,135
It's all right.

196
00:18:56,476 --> 00:19:00,378
I wanted to ask you something
because you're a doctor, right?

197
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,746
Yeah.

198
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:09,177
I don't like myself sometimes.

199
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,721
Can you help me?

200
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,092
Barry, I'm a dentist. What kind
of help do you think I can give you?

201
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:24,863
I know. Maybe you know
other doctors?

202
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,335
Like a psychiatrist?

203
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:30,306
I just don't have anybody else
I can talk to about things...

204
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:34,208
...and I understand
it's confidential with a doctor.

205
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,010
And I just... I don't want
my sisters to know, okay?

206
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:40,745
Because I'm embarrassed about this.

207
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,652
If it's about getting you
a phone number for a psychiatrist...

208
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:47,794
...I can do that. It's not a problem.

209
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:51,988
But what exactly is wrong?

210
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:54,793
I don't know
if there is anything wrong...

211
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:58,199
...because I don't
know how other people are.

212
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:04,309
I sometimes cry a lot...

213
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,737
...for no reason.

214
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,486
I'm sorry.

215
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:06,968
$ 1.79.

216
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,827
What am I looking for?
What am I looking for?

217
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:40,165
Tell me. Talk to me.

218
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,832
Talk to me. Talk to me.

219
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:47,942
Pudding.

220
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:18,010
I see you, Richard Seelan, yes.

221
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:20,840
All right, Mr. Seelan.

222
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,451
Hi, this is Janice. Who's this?

223
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,888
Hi. How you doing?

224
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,120
- Hi. Is this your first time calling?
- Yes, it is.

225
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:40,562
Can I have your credit card number
and expiration date?

226
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,862
Sure. How much is this, anyways?

227
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:49,031
It's $2.99 per minute for the first
half-hour, $ 1.99 per minute after that.

228
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:52,576
- Okay, and it's confidential?
- What do you mean?

229
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,011
The information I give you
is private, confidential?

230
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:59,310
Of course, yeah.
Would you like to talk to a girl?

231
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:03,354
I can connect you with a girl if I can
have your credit card number...

232
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:06,014
...followed by the expiration date.

233
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:10,458
Sure. 5-1-0-2...

234
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:14,659
...1-7-1-7...

235
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,370
...8- 1-1-8...

236
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,529
...6- 5-5-4.

237
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:23,267
Expiration, 05-04.

238
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:26,735
Your billing address
and the name on the card.

239
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:32,681
1274 Moorpark,
Sherman Oaks, California...

240
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:38,154
...Apartment 4. 91403, ZIP code.

241
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,049
- And your name?
- Barry Egan.

242
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:43,758
And your social security number.

243
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,693
What for?

244
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:49,824
It's just for verification through
the credit card company.

245
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:52,528
And this is confidential?

246
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:56,699
It's to verify your credit information.
It's confidential.

247
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:59,936
It appears on your credit card
as D & D Mattress Man.

248
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:02,206
Very good.

249
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:04,781
9-1...

250
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:08,352
- I'm sorry, 9-1-7...
- It's okay.

251
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,921
...6- 5...

252
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,188
...5- 0-1-2.

253
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:19,128
- Okay, so hang on, Barry, all right?
- Thank you very much.

254
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:25,762
We're all set.

255
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:29,705
Can I have the number
where we can call you back?

256
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:33,676
Could you possibly just connect me
to one of the girls?

257
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,806
Well, it's a callback service.
A girl will call you back.

258
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:41,545
I just was calling to speak
with one of the girls.

259
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:44,155
I thought that's how it worked.
I'm 8-1-8...

260
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:47,654
...7- 7-5...

261
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,722
...3- 9-9-3.

262
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:53,661
What kind of a girl
would you like to talk to?

263
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:58,065
I don't want anybody to know it's me.
I don't want them to know my name.

264
00:24:58,238 --> 00:25:01,867
- Nobody will know your name.
- Tell them my name's Jack.

265
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:06,206
- You want her to call you Jack?
- I don't want her to know it's me.

266
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,438
- Okay, Jack.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

267
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:11,277
- No problem. We'll call you right back.
- Terrific.

268
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,941
Okay.

269
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:45,143
Hello, this is Back.

270
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:48,082
I'm calling for Jack.

271
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:51,052
- How you doing?
- Hi. How are you doing?

272
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:53,215
- This is Jack.
- This is Georgia.

273
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:56,726
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing tonight?

274
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:59,091
Nothing. What are you doing?

275
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:02,564
I am laying on my bed.

276
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:05,465
- Where are you?
- I'm in my bedroom.

277
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:09,838
- No, I mean what state, what city?
- I'm in California.

278
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:13,570
- Me too. I'm in California.
- I know you are. I'm in Los Angeles.

279
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,213
I'm in Los Angeles too.

280
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:19,750
Well, maybe we should hook up
sometime. What do you think?

281
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,484
- Are you watching a porno movie?
- No, I'm not, Georgia.

282
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:28,525
- Do you like porno movies?
- Sure.

283
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:32,630
So Jack, are you stroking it?

284
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,664
No.

285
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,860
- What are you doing, then?
- I'm talking to you.

286
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,632
With your pants off?

287
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,571
No, my pants are on.

288
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:47,611
I'm only wearing a T-shirt
and panties.

289
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,442
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

290
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:54,246
And I'm looking at my shaved pussy
in the mirror.

291
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,287
- Want to know what I look like?
- Doesn't matter.

292
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,425
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

293
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:02,857
I have no way of finding out,
so it doesn't matter.

294
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:09,093
I'm not lying to you, Jack.
I'm about 5 foot 8, 34-28-34.

295
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,362
- My friends say I'm gorgeous.
- Really?

296
00:27:11,538 --> 00:27:15,030
- Yeah, really. What about you?
- That doesn't matter.

297
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,938
Yes, it does.

298
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:22,342
- You're married, aren't you?
- No.

299
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,746
- No? You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

300
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,721
- Where is she?
- She went out of town.

301
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:33,916
Good, I like that.

302
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:37,790
- I'm so horny, Jack. What about you?
- Sure.

303
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:42,431
- Do you like peaches, Jack?
- They're okay.

304
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:46,902
Well, you'll like them even better
because I'm a Georgia peach.

305
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,208
- Are you jacking off yet, Jack?
- No, I'm not.

306
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:55,006
Well, do you ever?

307
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:58,207
Sometimes, yeah, when I'm Ionely.

308
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:01,444
You don't have to be lonely,
because you got me now.

309
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:06,456
You sound very nice
and very personable.

310
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,890
Personable. Thank you, baby.

311
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,292
So, what do you do, Barry?

312
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:16,731
I work. I have my own business.
I work hard at doing my business.

313
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,269
- Are you good at your business?
- Yes.

314
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:24,172
Yeah? So do you do really well?
Do you make tons of money?

315
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:28,140
I'm doing pretty good,
I think, as a start.

316
00:28:28,314 --> 00:28:33,217
I wish I was making more, doing better,
but I can't get over a certain hump.

317
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:38,221
I will. L'll crack something very soon,
I think, and really do better.

318
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:43,055
I'd like to diversify,
but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.

319
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:46,957
Are you stroking it yet, baby?

320
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:50,331
- No, I'm not.
- Is your cock hard?

321
00:28:50,503 --> 00:28:52,903
I don't know what
it's doing right now.

322
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:57,099
Why don't you take
your clothes off, Jack.

323
00:28:57,377 --> 00:29:02,542
And I want to picture you laying
down with me next to you...

324
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:06,583
...and I want you to stroke
your cock, okay?

325
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:14,926
I'm so horny, Barry. I want you.

326
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,607
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing? How are you?

327
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:43,517
- I'm fine. Nothing. How are you?
- It's me. It's Georgia.

328
00:29:45,224 --> 00:29:48,352
- How's it going?
- It's okay that I'm calling, right?

329
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:49,961
Sure.

330
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,690
I just wanted to call
and thank you for last night...

331
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:56,664
...and just catch you before you
went to work and say hey.

332
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,031
Well, thank you.

333
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:03,005
I am so tired. I went to bed
so late last night.

334
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,668
- When did you go to sleep?
- Not very late.

335
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,145
- Well, you going to work now?
- Yes.

336
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:13,149
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

337
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,722
Remember last night I was telling
you about my apartment and my rent?

338
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,221
Remember?

339
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:23,120
This is so weird and really
embarrassing for me...

340
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:28,324
...but I was wondering if you'd
help me out with some money.

341
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,368
- Me?
- Yeah.

342
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,337
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
I can't afford that.

343
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:37,999
But you don't even know
how much it is.

344
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:42,443
- How much is it?
- Like 750. Seven hundred and fifty.

345
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:46,415
Yeah, no, I can't
afford that. I'm sorry.

346
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:51,114
- Seriously?
- You're having financial trouble?

347
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:55,693
It's so hard these days,
and, yeah, I really need it.

348
00:30:55,862 --> 00:31:00,356
Yeah, I just don't have enough
money to be able to do that. I'm sorry.

349
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,865
I thought you had your own business.

350
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,493
You said you were gonna
diversify and all that stuff.

351
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:08,936
So you think you can?

352
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,069
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,146
Maybe I should call back
and talk to your girlfriend?

354
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:18,545
Maybe it'd be better
to ask her for the money.

355
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:22,446
It could be really easy, Barry.
I have all your information.

356
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:27,218
- Your credit card, your billing stuff...
- Okay. No, thank you.

357
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:33,496
- Morning, Barry.
- Morning, Lance.

358
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,258
What's with all this pudding?

359
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,371
That's part of a pretty amazing
airline promotional giveaway.

360
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,703
I'm gonna collect puddings
and coupons that can be redeemed...

361
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:45,639
...for frequent flyer miles.

362
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,042
- You going on a trip?
- No, I'm not...

363
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:50,944
...but airline mileage is like
a currency these days.

364
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,347
- You should go on a trip.
- No, thank you.

365
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,419
What do you want me to do with it?

366
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:58,785
Why don't we just leave it
there for now.

367
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,153
Thank you very much. I'm well.
My name is Barry Egan.

368
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:14,391
I have a little problem
with my MasterCard.

369
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,360
I lost it and I found it again...

370
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,305
...and I'm afraid
in my losting and finding, I...

371
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:25,501
Somebody might have
used my card...

372
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:30,581
- And what's the account number?
- I did punch that in earlier. I'm sorry.

373
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,741
I'm just nervous about this.

374
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,116
I don't know the proper
etiquette in this situation.

375
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,417
I just wanna make sure
no one spent any money.

376
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:42,584
- I don't have money to burn.
- There's nothing...

377
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:46,198
- I'm clean for now?
- Yes, everything is fine.

378
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,334
- I'm sorry I sound panicked.
- That's okay...

379
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:50,992
- What's your name?
- Jeanette.

380
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,159
Nice to meet you.

381
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:54,932
- Okay, so l'll cut it up.
- That's fine.

382
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:59,203
l'll cut up my card,
then get a new one going, right?

383
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:00,709
- Yes, you will.
- Thanks.

384
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,869
You're welcome.

385
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:22,629
Why's that there?
I don't want to be a dick...

386
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:26,067
...but that could hurt somebody.
It already hurt me.

387
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:28,433
Let's please move that.

388
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,780
He's wearing that damn suit again.
I don't know why.

389
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,147
- He doesn't usually dress like that.
- That's fine.

390
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:47,158
Hey, why are you wearing
that suit again?

391
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:48,623
- I don't know.
- Hi.

392
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:49,818
- Hi.
- Remember me?

393
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:51,725
- I left my car yesterday.
- Yes.

394
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:55,492
This is Lena from work.
We're here to pick up her car.

395
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,001
We're getting breakfast.
So do you wanna go eat?

396
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:00,729
Yeah, I can't.

397
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,298
- Why?
- I have to stay here.

398
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:06,069
- Seriously, we're going to eat.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:08,270
- That's all right.
- What is that?

400
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:11,883
- Are you learning to play the piano?
- That's not a piano.

401
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:15,178
Lance! Remember we have
to call that guy in Toledo.

402
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:17,345
- Which guy?
- L'll tell you later.

403
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:21,788
- You don't want to eat with us?
- Telephone, Barry, on line two.

404
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:24,122
What's all that pudding?

405
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:27,495
I don't know.
l'll talk to you in a second.

406
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,534
- Let me get this.
- What's that pudding, Barry?

407
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:31,692
This is Barry.

408
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:34,271
Hey, baby. I guess
we got disconnected.

409
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,376
We got disconnect... How did
you get this number for my work?

410
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:42,981
You canceled your credit card.
I need you not to and up your limit.

411
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,083
Okay, this is making
me very uncomfortable.

412
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:51,212
I need help. Maybe I should just
call back and talk to your girlfriend.

413
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,858
- I don't have one.
- You said you did.

414
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,460
- I know, but I don't.
- You lied to me?

415
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,893
This is illegal, okay? I'm sorry.

416
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:01,727
- L'll call the police.
- No, you won't.

417
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:04,531
This is embarrassing.
Sorry.

418
00:36:04,737 --> 00:36:07,205
- L'll go pay for my car.
- Are you sure?

419
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,397
He's being weird.

420
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:12,305
- I don't know why he's in that suit.
- It's not bad. It's okay.

421
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:15,537
He's strange. I don't know
if you'd want to date him.

422
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:20,152
- It's okay. L'll just pay for my car.
- I'm sorry.

423
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:30,625
- Come on, rich boy.
- This isn't cool.

424
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:32,889
- It was last night.
- I'm hanging up.

425
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,727
- You don't know what could happen.
- I have to go.

426
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:36,890
This is a big mis...

427
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,527
- She's cool, right?
- Why did you just come by like this?

428
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:44,164
- It's not cool?
- No, it's fine. I feel put on the spot.

429
00:36:44,343 --> 00:36:47,938
- Think you'll ask her out?
- I don't do things like that.

430
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:52,073
- Why are you being scared?
- I'm not being scared.

431
00:36:52,284 --> 00:36:56,380
- You'll rag on me if I do this.
- Why would I do this to rag you?

432
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:58,819
- I don't know.
- Can I ask you a question?

433
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:01,390
Did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

434
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:06,163
Did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

435
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:09,392
What's the matter with you?
Are you okay?

436
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:11,900
He is lying.

437
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,872
You're being weird again.
Please don't be weird.

438
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,531
We should be going.

439
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,069
Yep. Nope. I have
to get something from my car.

440
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,773
What guy in Toledo
are you talking about?

441
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,815
I'm talking about the guy.

442
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:30,888
- L'll come over and tell you.
- Is this about the Ramada Inn?

443
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:34,055
l'll just come over
to you in a second.

444
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:43,199
I'm sorry I couldn't come
to your sister's party.

445
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,666
I couldn't make it.

446
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,030
Not a problem. Don't worry.
We had a terrific time.

447
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:50,568
Must be weird
to have so many sisters.

448
00:37:50,743 --> 00:37:54,076
- Not at all. It's nice.
- Telephone, Barry, line one.

449
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,248
Pardon.

450
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,918
- This is Barry.
- Hang up and there'll be trouble.

451
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,383
- Thank you.
- What do you mean, thank...?

452
00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:05,285
- Business is good. You're busy.
- Not really.

453
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,925
- I saw a picture of you.
- Oh, yes?

454
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,420
Elizabeth has a picture
of your sisters and you.

455
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,588
It's a lot of family. Must be nice.

456
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,291
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- No. I'm the opposite.

457
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:21,100
That must be nice.
That must be really...

458
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,969
No, it's terrible.

459
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:28,310
- What's the pudding for?
- That's something else.

460
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,940
- You going to get pancakes?
- Yes, we are. We're going to...

461
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:34,881
- God!
- Where you guys going?

462
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:37,215
How long have you
worked for my sister?

463
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,323
- Six months.
- So you know her.

464
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:42,426
- Do you wanna check that?
- Sure.

465
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,229
Are you guys hurt?
They're okay.

466
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:48,662
So, what do you do?
You do what she does? Same job?

467
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:53,100
I do, but I do mainly field
consultations, which is cool...

468
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:56,730
...'cause I get to travel.
I'm going to Hawaii on Friday.

469
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:59,035
Hawaii?
I was thinking about going there.

470
00:38:59,111 --> 00:38:59,702
Really?

471
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:01,880
Going on business.

472
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:05,448
- Lf you're going...
- I probably won't, though.

473
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:08,485
That's too bad,
because it's so great there...

474
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:11,748
...and if you were there,
we could say hello.

475
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:15,223
Yes, but I'm not sure.
I have so much going on here.

476
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,728
It depends on this thing. If it happens,
I won't be able to go.

477
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,801
I can't find that thing in my car.
I can give it to you later.

478
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:27,803
- So are you gonna come eat with us?
- Yeah, I can't.

479
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,865
Oh, my God!

480
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,443
It was great to meet you again.

481
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:36,706
- Thanks for helping.
- What's that piano? This pudding?

482
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:39,077
- I don't know.
- Why are they here?

483
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:44,052
Call me later about the shrink. And
Walter said you have a crying problem?

484
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,087
Call me later.

485
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:52,728
He's obviously very busy. I don't even
know if he has time for a girlfriend.

486
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:54,263
Sorry.

487
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:57,961
- So l'll just see you at the restaurant?
- Okay.

488
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:29,296
I'm gonna go and eat tomorrow night.
Do you want to go with me?

489
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:31,196
Sure.

490
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:34,770
- Do you want to pick me up?
- Sure.

491
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,408
Can I write down my address
and phone number?

492
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,600
Sure.

493
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,646
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

494
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:51,315
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

495
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:56,788
I didn't ask for a shrink.
That was somebody else.

496
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:58,862
Also, that pudding isn't mine.

497
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:02,432
I'm wearing a suit because
I had an important meeting.

498
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:06,128
- And I don't have a crying problem.
- Okay.

499
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

500
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:33,295
- This is Barry.
- You made a fucking war for yourself.

501
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:44,933
- How do you know he's rich?
- He's gonna diversify.

502
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:48,178
- Diversify what?
- His business.

503
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,542
- And what is his name?
- Barry Egan.

504
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:53,183
I can take the brothers
on this mission?

505
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:57,721
- We'll do it.
- Thank you so much.

506
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:08,630
Check. Check. One, two. Test. Test.
How's that sound?

507
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,961
You can't do that. It's wrong.

508
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:13,860
Check.

509
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,735
Check. Check.
One, two. Test.

510
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,171
They'll go.

511
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:19,639
Great.

512
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:22,337
- I'm only paying two of you.
- That's cool.

513
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:26,382
When can you leave? I want you
to go right away. That's best.

514
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:31,249
I also need you to check out a car
for me there that this guy's selling.

515
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,754
- Your expenses are your own.
- Latisha said you'd pay.

516
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:38,656
- She was wrong.
- That's not cool.

517
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:43,393
It doesn't make sense if you
think about it in a fair, deal-like sense.

518
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:44,661
It's business.

519
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:49,170
$ 100, two days' work. It's more than
your family makes sitting around.

520
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:54,074
All right? Now, I'm serious now,
okay? Please. Now, just stop.

521
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:56,907
Keys to the truck.
You got to gas that up.

522
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:00,848
All right, save receipts on that.
His address.

523
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:04,378
We have his business
address too, but...

524
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:05,648
You know what?

525
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:10,259
Hit him at his house first.

526
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:14,027
See what this little bad-boy
businessman is all about.

527
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,497
Just fix it, sir.

528
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,704
You know, I wanna tell you
something. I've gotta tell you.

529
00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:21,862
Oh, no.

530
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,565
I saw a picture
of your sisters and you...

531
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:29,680
...and I saw your picture,
and I really wanted to meet you.

532
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,778
I came to drop my car off
on purpose, to try and meet you.

533
00:43:41,393 --> 00:43:43,918
- Are you lying?
- No.

534
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:46,860
- Oh, my...
- I thought I should tell you.

535
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:51,593
I didn't want to get too far along on
going out and be hiding something.

536
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:55,935
Very nice of you to say.

537
00:43:56,341 --> 00:43:57,740
Terrific.

538
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,979
I was listening
to DJs this morning...

539
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:08,414
...and they always have couples that
call in and talk about their problems.

540
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,611
This DJ Justice...

541
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:13,986
This morning DJ
that I really like and...

542
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:16,956
They were talking
about yearbook pictures...

543
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:21,031
...and how nobody's happy
with the way they look.

544
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,466
I love this guy because he tells it
the way it is. He's not a phony.

545
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:30,404
And this guy calls up, and
he's talking about his senior quote...

546
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:34,136
...and DJ Justice says,
"What was great about your quote?"

547
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:36,814
He says,
"I stole an ancient proverb."

548
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:42,146
And so he says, "Okay."
And he says, "Confusion say..."

549
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:45,984
And then DJ Justice says,
"Confusion or Confucius?"

550
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:50,355
And it was just so comical. DJ
Justice just cuts you down to size.

551
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:53,828
That's my favorite part of the show.
I laugh and laugh.

552
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:55,990
Even when I'm alone.

553
00:44:57,035 --> 00:45:02,302
So how's your business going?
Did you sell all that pudding?

554
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:08,243
That pudding is not a sales item.

555
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:10,375
Why?

556
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:15,186
It's not for sale.

557
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:17,387
Really?

558
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:19,888
Why is that?

559
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:24,024
I'd rather not say, if that's okay.

560
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:27,359
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it,
like, a secret pudding?

561
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:33,170
Let's just keep it between
you and I, if that's possible?

562
00:45:33,338 --> 00:45:35,067
Sure, sure.

563
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:43,745
Healthy Choice and American Airlines
got together for this promotion.

564
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,043
If you buy any 10
of Healthy Choice products...

565
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:49,812
...they'll award you
500 frequent flyer miles.

566
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:53,991
With this special coupon,
they'll up it to a thousand miles.

567
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:58,891
So I think they're trying to push their
teriyaki chicken, which is $ 1.79.

568
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:03,158
But I looked in the supermarket,
and I saw that they had...

569
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,428
...pudding for 25 cents a cup.

570
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:08,071
Comes in packages of four.

571
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,408
But insanely...

572
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:14,545
...the bar codes
are on the individual cups.

573
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,710
So a quarter a cup...

574
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,009
Say you bought $2.50 worth.

575
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:24,622
That's worth 500 miles.
With the coupon, it's 1000 miles.

576
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,317
It's a marketing mistake,
but I'm taking advantage of it.

577
00:46:29,227 --> 00:46:34,130
If you spent $3000, that would
get you a million frequent flyer miles.

578
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:37,359
You'd never pay for a ticket
the rest of your life.

579
00:46:37,536 --> 00:46:41,973
So you bought all that pudding so
you could get frequent flyer miles?

580
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,506
That's insane.

581
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,576
I'm guessing it was a mistake.

582
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:51,340
But I'm taking advantage
of it while it's offered.

583
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,783
Who knows how long it'll last
if too many people start doing it.

584
00:46:57,923 --> 00:47:02,087
Your sister was telling me
a very funny story about you...

585
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:07,892
...when you guys were kids.
You were building a ramp for the dog...

586
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:12,628
...and you threw a hammer straight
through a sliding glass door.

587
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:14,465
Is that right?

588
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,670
Threw a hammer?
I don't remember doing that.

589
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:25,279
My sister's a liar.

590
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:29,281
I have to go to the bathroom.

591
00:47:45,437 --> 00:47:48,634
Okay. Sorry.

592
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:52,601
The waiter come by yet?

593
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:53,971
- Hello.
- Hi.

594
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:55,773
Can I talk to you, sir?

595
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,237
Why?

596
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,112
- I need you for a second, please.
- Okay.

597
00:48:03,822 --> 00:48:06,689
- Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.
- Yeah.

598
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:09,019
- Did you do it?
- No.

599
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,923
- You didn't smash up the bathroom?
- No.

600
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,088
Well, who did?

601
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,066
I don't know.

602
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,295
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I cut myself.

603
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:22,996
- How?
- On my knife.

604
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:26,976
What? What?

605
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,511
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I know.

606
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:32,411
- You have to leave.
- I didn't do anything.

607
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,744
I can't prove you smashed
the bathroom...

608
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,978
I didn't do that. I didn't.

609
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:39,180
- I have to ask you to go.
- Okay.

610
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:41,416
- I didn't do it.
- You have to leave.

611
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:44,289
- Don't do this.
- Sir, I will call the police.

612
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,488
All right. Can I just stay?

613
00:48:46,665 --> 00:48:50,863
Sir, I'm gonna crack your
fucking head open. Get out of here.

614
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:53,693
We should go.

615
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:55,965
- I don't like it here, okay?
- Okay.

616
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,006
Thanks.

617
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,877
Thank you.

618
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,334
Okay.

619
00:50:06,511 --> 00:50:09,446
Hey, you hit it.
You can stop laughing.

620
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:14,278
So you know that...

621
00:50:14,452 --> 00:50:17,910
...the harmonium that's ended
up in your office?

622
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:24,622
A harmonium?

623
00:50:26,298 --> 00:50:27,322
The piano.

624
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:34,030
Did you steal that from the street?

625
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,034
What's this?

626
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,303
You did, didn't you?

627
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:47,315
Yeah, I did. Why, is it yours?

628
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:49,816
No, it's yours.

629
00:50:56,828 --> 00:50:59,092
You learning to play it?

630
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,664
I wouldn't put on any concerts yet.

631
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:05,894
I'm trying.

632
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,868
Great. So I'm sorry,
I don't mean to pry...

633
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,806
...about the pudding and
the harmonium and everything...

634
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:16,311
- Not at all.
- You must travel quite a lot.

635
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:20,144
Oh, no, no, no. I don't travel.

636
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:24,243
No?

637
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:28,185
You want to take a left up here.

638
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,920
Okay, I'm gonna go.

639
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:35,395
Good to see you again. Good to see
your face again and go out with you.

640
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,696
l'll be back in town in a few days.
But if you come to Hawaii...

641
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:42,737
- I don't know. We'll see.
- You don't think you'll go?

642
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:46,707
- L'll call you when I get back.
- Okay.

643
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,672
Have a good trip.

644
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:53,280
And bye-bye.

645
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:02,423
And bye-bye.

646
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:06,092
And bye-bye. You fucking...

647
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,463
And bye-bye.
You stupid motherfucker.

648
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:19,275
Are you Barry?

649
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:25,013
- Yes.
- This is for you.

650
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:30,946
Okay.

651
00:52:37,629 --> 00:52:40,996
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

652
00:52:44,302 --> 00:52:46,463
This is Barry.

653
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:48,868
It's me. It's Lena.

654
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:51,708
Hi.

655
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,574
I just wanted you to know...

656
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:58,409
...wherever you're going
or whatever you're doing right now...

657
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:02,212
...I want you to know that
I wanted to kiss you just then.

658
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:04,889
Really?

659
00:53:05,623 --> 00:53:07,716
Yeah.

660
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:19,330
- That was good.
- Yeah.

661
00:54:19,497 --> 00:54:23,661
- L'll see you later.
- Okay.

662
00:54:25,837 --> 00:54:29,170
I don't freak out very often.

663
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,932
What do you mean?

664
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:34,135
No matter what my sister says, okay?

665
00:54:34,512 --> 00:54:38,312
- I don't know what you mean.
- I don't freak out.

666
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,212
Okay.

667
00:54:40,385 --> 00:54:44,412
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

668
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:56,491
So I got $500. That's maximum.
That's what I can take out in a day.

669
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:58,185
Okay.

670
00:55:58,363 --> 00:56:00,923
This is what you get
when you're a pervert.

671
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:05,092
Said you'd help and you didn't,
so we'll take this money to her...

672
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,135
...and that's that.

673
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:11,071
Okay, but before you guys go,
I want to bring up one thing:

674
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,607
I said no to Georgia.

675
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:17,271
She wanted the money, and I had
to decline. I don't have that much.

676
00:56:17,448 --> 00:56:20,542
That money I gave you
is a lot of money to me.

677
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,878
Ninety-nine cents.

678
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:26,319
So I don't know if this is fair.
Wait, whoa. No. No, plea...

679
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:36,827
Want to fuck with what my brothers are
saying? Fuck with my family? Fuck!

680
00:57:01,392 --> 00:57:03,860
Help me!

681
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,195
Help me.

682
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,521
Where the fuck are you going?
We know where you live.

683
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,900
Good morning.

684
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:52,906
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

685
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:55,170
Come on in here.

686
00:57:56,647 --> 00:57:58,512
Let's shut...

687
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:07,652
- I got in trouble last night.
- What happened?

688
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:09,952
I made a phone call.

689
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:13,029
Come here. Come here.

690
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:15,757
Barry, come here.

691
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:29,903
I better get more pudding.

692
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:34,279
Barry, telephone on line one.
Barry, telephone on line one.

693
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:36,249
- This is Barry.
- It's Rhonda.

694
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:39,514
I need to talk to you about
smashing the windows...

695
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,217
- I'm going out of town for two days.
- Where you going?

696
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,557
- Hawaii. But you can't tell my sisters.
- Hawaii?

697
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:50,929
- That is so wonderful.
- Just don't tell my sisters.

698
00:58:51,102 --> 00:58:54,538
I have to get more pudding
for this trip to Hawaii.

699
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:57,731
I realize it sounds strange,
but it's not.

700
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,276
- So would you like to come with me?
- Right now?

701
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:03,311
Yes.

702
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:08,177
I saw the teriyaki chicken for $ 1.79,
then the soup was a real deal.

703
00:59:08,386 --> 00:59:13,153
But to stumble across the pudding,
it's tremendous how people don't look.

704
00:59:13,324 --> 00:59:17,385
They don't look at the fine print.
Oh, my.

705
00:59:17,562 --> 00:59:19,189
Okay!

706
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,736
You can go to places in the world
with pudding. That is funny.

707
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:35,879
That's funny.

708
00:59:41,319 --> 00:59:43,184
Yes!

709
00:59:51,696 --> 00:59:53,357
It's gonna work.

710
00:59:53,531 --> 00:59:58,230
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
Lena, I'm coming.

711
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:01,371
- I'm gonna get on line.
- Lena. Aloha.

712
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:04,599
- Barry, l'll be on line.
- Okay. I'm coming.

713
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:06,367
Okay.

714
01:00:07,945 --> 01:00:11,847
What do you mean? It doesn't say
six to eight weeks anywhere.

715
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:15,349
It takes that long to process
and validate the order.

716
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,818
I had this planned in my mind, okay?

717
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,652
I could get the pudding to you today.
I'm leaving today.

718
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,761
I've explained this.
It takes time to process.

719
01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:28,693
How am I supposed to know this
if you don't tell me this?

720
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:32,597
If it's not in the fine print.
That's an impossibility.

721
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:36,637
- It takes time to process.
- I didn't see a six or an eight.

722
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:42,370
- This is bullcrap to me.
- That's how long it takes to process.

723
01:00:42,547 --> 01:00:44,447
Hello?

724
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:46,647
Hello?

725
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:49,387
Hello?

726
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:50,547
Hello?

727
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:12,105
All right!

728
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:17,913
The pudding takes six to eight weeks
to process, so that won't work.

729
01:01:18,082 --> 01:01:23,213
l'll take a bath on that today.
But here's what I'm gonna tell you.

730
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:27,118
- Now, the pudding...
- Yeah?

731
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,751
- You okay?
- The chair broke.

732
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:34,455
We'll get to the pudding later.
I'm gonna go now.

733
01:01:34,632 --> 01:01:36,566
l'll call you from there.

734
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,669
- You run the place till I'm back.
- No doubt.

735
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:43,739
- Don't tell my sisters anything, okay?
- Absolutely.

736
01:01:58,522 --> 01:02:00,387
- Good afternoon.
- Thank you.

737
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:04,027
- Have a great flight.
- Thanks very much.

738
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:33,587
I've never been on a plane before.

739
01:02:35,426 --> 01:02:39,385
- What was that sound?
- I don't know.

740
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,721
- Hi.
- Hi. Where you wanna go?

741
01:03:11,896 --> 01:03:15,889
Could you take me to where
the beach is and the hotels are?

742
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,763
And I'm gonna need a phone.

743
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:26,865
Hello?

744
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:28,807
- It's me.
- What are you doing?

745
01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:32,847
Nothing, I'm at work. I was wondering
about your friend Lena.

746
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,382
Yeah, what about her?

747
01:03:34,552 --> 01:03:38,249
I was wondering if you know
where she's staying in Hawaii.

748
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:40,390
She left her pocketbook here.

749
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:43,755
I wanna get it to her,
make sure she's not nervous.

750
01:03:43,928 --> 01:03:47,295
I know exactly where she's staying,
and you're lying.

751
01:03:47,465 --> 01:03:50,957
She didn't forget her purse.
Why do you want her number?

752
01:03:51,135 --> 01:03:53,399
- Don't do this.
- Why do you want it?

753
01:03:53,604 --> 01:03:55,799
- All I want is her number.
- Why?

754
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,634
- Don't treat me this way.
- Do you like her?

755
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:01,937
- You're killing me.
- Oh, my God. Calm down.

756
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:04,638
All I want is her fucking number!

757
01:04:04,815 --> 01:04:09,115
Give me that fucking number.
You hear me? I'm sick of this shit!

758
01:04:09,286 --> 01:04:13,882
Stop fucking treating me this way.
l'll fucking kill you. You want that?

759
01:04:15,192 --> 01:04:19,185
- Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.
- Hi, yes. Lena Leonard's room.

760
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:22,491
- Okay, one moment.
- Thank you.

761
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:27,930
Hello?

762
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:29,732
Hello?

763
01:04:31,709 --> 01:04:35,645
- Is Lena there?
- You have the wrong room.

764
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,510
Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.

765
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:45,678
Hi. I just called. I think I was
connected to the wrong room.

766
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:50,657
I'm looking for a Lena Leonard.
There shouldn't be a man in that room.

767
01:04:52,229 --> 01:04:54,629
One moment, please.

768
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:57,567
Thank you.

769
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:03,237
Hello?

770
01:05:03,707 --> 01:05:05,937
- Lena!
- Yeah?

771
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,271
Hi, this is Barry Egan.

772
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:12,405
Oh, wow, yeah?! That's great!
You came, you came!

773
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:15,143
- What are you doing?
- I didn't hear you!

774
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:17,719
I just want to know
what you're doing?

775
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:21,654
- Where are you?
- I'm calling you. I'm in my hotel room!

776
01:05:21,826 --> 01:05:24,761
Yeah, I'm just down here
on my business trip!

777
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:28,160
Let's do something, then.
You want to do something?

778
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:31,768
Yeah! You don't have a boyfriend
or anything, do you?

779
01:05:31,936 --> 01:05:35,064
- No! What do you mean?
- I just wanted to know.

780
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:39,403
- When's the last time you had one?
- About six months ago. Why?

781
01:05:39,577 --> 01:05:43,638
- I just wanted to make sure.
- When did you last have a girlfriend?

782
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:46,044
- Were you ever married?
- Yeah.

783
01:05:46,217 --> 01:05:49,550
Okay. How long were you married for?

784
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,416
Do you want to meet
and talk about this?

785
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:55,957
Okay. Where are you from originally?

786
01:07:06,997 --> 01:07:08,828
I'm here.

787
01:07:56,847 --> 01:07:59,873
You got me out of my hotel room.

788
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:03,610
You came and got me out of my room.

789
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:07,413
It's so nice.

790
01:08:15,899 --> 01:08:19,232
It really looks like Hawaii here.

791
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:57,591
I'm sorry. I forgot to shave.

792
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,901
Your face is so adorable...

793
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,767
...and your skin and your cheek.

794
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:06,239
I want to bite it.

795
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:11,744
I want to bite your cheek
and chew on it. It's so fucking cute.

796
01:10:13,484 --> 01:10:18,387
I'm looking at your face
and I just want to smash it.

797
01:10:18,555 --> 01:10:21,991
I just want to fucking smash it
with a sledgehammer...

798
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,627
...and squeeze it. You're so pretty.

799
01:10:24,795 --> 01:10:29,095
I want to chew your face,
and I want to scoop out your eyes...

800
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:33,999
...and I want to eat them.
Chew them and suck on them.

801
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:37,263
Okay.

802
01:10:37,808 --> 01:10:41,175
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

803
01:10:41,345 --> 01:10:43,677
This is nice.

804
01:10:55,459 --> 01:11:01,091
At that restaurant, I beat up
the bathroom. I'm sorry.

805
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:14,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

806
01:11:14,211 --> 01:11:19,046
They need to see the new 4-84s
to make sure it works with their OC.

807
01:11:19,216 --> 01:11:24,119
- Okay. What should I do about Eric?
- Just tell him to call me.

808
01:11:24,288 --> 01:11:28,156
- Okay. So did my brother call you?
- No.

809
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:32,227
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm sorry that didn't work out.

810
01:11:32,429 --> 01:11:35,159
- It's fine.
- You don't wanna date him anyway.

811
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:40,235
- Honestly, he's a freak sometimes.
- Yeah, he did seem a little strange.

812
01:11:40,404 --> 01:11:44,898
Well, he's not that strange.
Don't say that.

813
01:11:45,876 --> 01:11:50,745
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I think he's weird, but that's me.

814
01:11:52,783 --> 01:11:57,413
- Okay. So should I call you later?
- That's okay.

815
01:11:57,588 --> 01:12:01,422
l'll just see you when you get back.
Okay, bye.

816
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:13,427
- So where do you have to go?
- For what?

817
01:12:13,937 --> 01:12:15,928
For work.

818
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:21,810
I don't have any business here.
I came here for you.

819
01:12:43,934 --> 01:12:47,529
- Hello there, guy.
- Hi, look. This is Bar...

820
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:51,162
You have almost reached me,
but not quite.

821
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:55,971
I'm shaving my roommate's pussy
right now, so I'm a bit distracted.

822
01:12:56,146 --> 01:13:00,310
Leave your name and home phone
number, area code first, please.

823
01:13:00,484 --> 01:13:04,511
l'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
God, she's so sexy.

824
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:05,712
Bye, honey.

825
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:10,326
This is Barry Egan. I'm calling
about what took place the other night.

826
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:14,453
I wanted to tell everybody
it was not fair what you did to me.

827
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:18,567
I am expecting my money back.
I realize you have my number.

828
01:13:18,735 --> 01:13:23,263
I'm on vacation now. If you want
to reach me, shortly I will be home...

829
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,568
...and we can discuss
how you can return my money.

830
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:30,645
Otherwise, I'm pretty sure
that the police can be contacted...

831
01:13:30,814 --> 01:13:34,477
...and I could do that,
and I feel like it's warranted.

832
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:38,212
So let's figure something out.

833
01:13:38,388 --> 01:13:43,758
Like I said, l'll be home shortly.
Give me a call. Okay, thank you.

834
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:04,337
How many airplanes
have you been on?

835
01:14:05,382 --> 01:14:08,647
I think, maybe over a hundred.

836
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:13,514
- That's right, you travel a lot.
- Yeah.

837
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:21,262
How much do you travel?
Do you travel all the time?

838
01:14:23,567 --> 01:14:25,933
Forgot about that.

839
01:14:28,405 --> 01:14:31,533
Can I come home with you
when we get there?

840
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:33,605
Of course.

841
01:14:33,777 --> 01:14:35,768
Is it okay to ask that?

842
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:42,512
I thought that you were anyways.

843
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:24,590
Come here.

844
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,039
Are you okay?

845
01:15:46,216 --> 01:15:49,151
- Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

846
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,415
- What is this?
- It's okay. It's okay.

847
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:57,589
Follow the penlight
with your eyes, okay?

848
01:15:58,628 --> 01:16:02,428
People are just crazy
in this world, I think.

849
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:58,517
- Hi. Janice the operator. Who's this?
- This is Barry Egan.

850
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:02,556
- We talked. Do you remember?
- No, sweetie, I don't remember.

851
01:17:02,726 --> 01:17:06,287
Cut the crap, lady!
You said your name was Georgia.

852
01:17:06,463 --> 01:17:10,092
You said our conversation
was confidential! I trusted you.

853
01:17:10,267 --> 01:17:14,727
And then you called me
and asked for money! Am I right?!

854
01:17:14,905 --> 01:17:16,133
- Am I right?!
- Sir...

855
01:17:16,306 --> 01:17:18,399
Get your supervisor on the phone!

856
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:22,272
I want whoever owns that place
on the phone! You hear me?!

857
01:17:22,445 --> 01:17:26,814
- Can you wait a second, please?
- No more bullcrap! I'm not kidding!!

858
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,060
- Yeah, this is Dean.
- It's me.

859
01:17:39,262 --> 01:17:44,063
Barry Egan's on the other line.
He wants to talk to a supervisor.

860
01:17:44,234 --> 01:17:45,826
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

861
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,004
- Put him through.
- This is bad...

862
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,763
Will you shut up?

863
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,466
Okay, sexy. L'll connect you
with my supervisor.

864
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:55,838
You're in trouble, honey.

865
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:57,969
Who's this?

866
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:00,946
My name's Barry Egan.
I called your service...

867
01:18:01,117 --> 01:18:03,642
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- What?

868
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,015
Calm down.
What's the problem?

869
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:09,488
The problem is, if you let
me explain, your employee...

870
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:13,493
...that girl who I was just speaking with,
has been threatening me.

871
01:18:13,663 --> 01:18:16,655
And four blond gentlemen
just attacked me...

872
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:20,132
...and smashed my car
and hurt my girl.

873
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:25,502
Go fuck yourself. That has nothing to
do with me. I run a legitimate business.

874
01:18:25,675 --> 01:18:26,937
Listen to me.

875
01:18:27,143 --> 01:18:31,512
- What's your name, sir?! Answer me!
- What's your name, asshole?!

876
01:18:31,681 --> 01:18:32,978
I'm Barry Egan!

877
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:35,741
How do I know?!
You could be anybody!

878
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:40,879
You have no right taking people's
confidence in your service!

879
01:18:41,057 --> 01:18:44,788
- You're sick!
- No, shut up! Shut the fuck up!

880
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:47,862
You have no right
to take people's trust.

881
01:18:48,031 --> 01:18:52,434
Shut up! Shut! Shut!
Shut! Shut! Shut up!

882
01:18:52,702 --> 01:18:54,169
Shut up!

883
01:18:54,971 --> 01:18:57,838
Now! Are you threatening me, dick?!

884
01:18:58,008 --> 01:18:59,270
Why don't you...?

885
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:01,501
You go fuck yourself!

886
01:19:06,383 --> 01:19:09,910
You... Fuck! Did you just say,
"Go fuck myself"?

887
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,518
Yes, I did.

888
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,390
That wasn't good!
You're dead!

889
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:21,957
Is there...?

890
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,865
Is that guy in the blue suit, is he
just around the corner? Can you...?

891
01:19:27,037 --> 01:19:29,631
Yes, there's a police officer here.

892
01:19:29,839 --> 01:19:32,467
No, the guy who came with me.
Is he there?

893
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:36,169
I'm not sure. We can ask
the receptionist to get him.

894
01:19:36,346 --> 01:19:38,507
He's probably in the waiting room.

895
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,075
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

896
01:20:12,248 --> 01:20:16,378
There was a blond woman in there.
Did they move her room?

897
01:20:16,553 --> 01:20:19,784
- What's her name, sir?
- Lena Leonard.

898
01:20:19,956 --> 01:20:22,390
- Are you a relative?
- Yes.

899
01:20:22,559 --> 01:20:26,586
- Just a minute. Let me check for you.
- Okay.

900
01:20:27,964 --> 01:20:32,594
- She was discharged this evening.
- She was discharged, okay.

901
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:50,009
Welcome to Directory Assistance.
City and state, please.

902
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:52,677
Somewhere in Utah.

903
01:20:52,956 --> 01:20:54,787
Thank you.

904
01:20:58,361 --> 01:20:59,953
What listing?

905
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:04,157
Can I have the listing
for D & D Mattress Man?

906
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,429
- Fuck you.
- No.

907
01:22:11,634 --> 01:22:13,761
You're a pervert.

908
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,872
Think you can be a pervert
and not pay for it?

909
01:22:18,575 --> 01:22:20,167
Don't you say that to me.

910
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:23,605
- You called the phone-sex...
- Shut up.

911
01:22:25,748 --> 01:22:27,545
I didn't do anything.

912
01:22:28,351 --> 01:22:32,811
I'm a nice man.
I mind my own business.

913
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:38,928
So you tell me that's that
before I beat the hell from you.

914
01:22:40,797 --> 01:22:44,893
I have so much strength in me.
You have no idea.

915
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:50,568
I have a love in my life.

916
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:55,404
It makes me stronger
than anything you can imagine.

917
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:59,745
I would say that's that, Mattress Man.

918
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:12,783
You came all the way
from L.A. to tell me this?

919
01:23:12,962 --> 01:23:14,725
Yes, I did.

920
01:23:19,302 --> 01:23:21,395
Tell the cops?

921
01:23:22,839 --> 01:23:24,534
No.

922
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:30,174
All right.

923
01:23:31,681 --> 01:23:33,649
That's that.

924
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:49,628
- Now, get the fuck out of here, pervert!
- Didn't I warn you?!

925
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:51,664
That's that.

926
01:24:05,982 --> 01:24:09,748
- Barry, you okay? What's going on?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

927
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:10,977
Where you been?

928
01:24:11,154 --> 01:24:16,114
I was in Utah, but now I'm here
and l'll be right back.

929
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,189
Barry?

930
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:23,923
Where you going?

931
01:24:53,396 --> 01:24:55,227
Lena.

932
01:24:55,565 --> 01:24:57,760
I'm so sorry.

933
01:24:57,934 --> 01:25:02,303
I'm so sorry I left you
at the hospital.

934
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,008
I called a phone-sex line...

935
01:25:06,175 --> 01:25:10,043
I called a phone-sex line
before I met you...

936
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:14,206
...and four blond brothers
came after me...

937
01:25:14,384 --> 01:25:17,547
...and they hurt you, and I'm sorry.

938
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,486
Then I had to leave again
because I wanted to make sure...

939
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:24,183
...you never got hurt again.

940
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,728
And I have a lot of pudding...

941
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:32,129
...and in six to eight weeks,
it can be redeemed.

942
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:36,135
So if you could just give me
that much time...

943
01:25:36,305 --> 01:25:40,833
...I think I can get enough mileage
to go with you wherever you go...

944
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,501
...if you have to travel
for your work.

945
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,343
Because I don't ever want
to be anywhere without you.

946
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:51,920
So could you just let me
redeem the mileage?

947
01:25:52,088 --> 01:25:56,218
- You left me at the hospital.
- I'm sorry.

948
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:58,889
You can't do that.

949
01:25:59,929 --> 01:26:02,864
If you just give me
six to eight weeks...

950
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:05,000
...I can redeem the mileage...

951
01:26:05,168 --> 01:26:08,968
...and I can go with you
wherever you have to travel.

952
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:11,963
So here we go.
