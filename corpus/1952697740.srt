1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,100
Every good spy needs a cover.

2
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,600
Be a journalist, they said.

3
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,400
You're good with words.

4
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,400
You'll be safe.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,700
Where is the girl, Mr. Soames?

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,200
Where is the girl?

7
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,800
This way!

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Please have a seat.

9
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,600
I'd like to call the American Consulate and
tell them where I am.

10
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,000
They've already been informed.

11
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Someone's coming to pick you up.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
That might be them.

13
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
The last time we spoke...

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
...I didn't realize how fond
of Mrs. Lan-Ting you were.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,800
If I'd known, I'd have been more careful
what I said.

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,300
Both the Lan-Tings are friends of mine.

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,700
But only one of them accompanied you
to your hotel last night.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
She came to tell me she was still in love
with her husband.

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,900
I'd be careful.

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,600
It isn't in some people's nature
to love us back.

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,000
Where is she...

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,500
...Mr. Soames?

24
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,800
I don't know.

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
I have no idea.

26
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,300
Where is she?

27
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,200
A friend of mine told me...

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,900
...Shanghai was the Paris of the Orient.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Due to an international treaty...

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
...every nationality under the sun lived
within her borders...

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,900
...Chinese and English,
French, Japanese, American.

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,600
My friend said you could travel the world
in an afternoon...

33
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,700
...and never leave the confines of Shanghai's
international settlement.

34
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,900
It seems like Shanghai's gonna be a
bit of a comedown for you after Berlin,

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,300
Mr. Soames.

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Not from what I hear, sir.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,100
I meant as a journalist, not a bachelor.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Well, if Japan doesn't
withdraw from China soon...

39
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,200
...Roosevelt's threatened to get his hands dirty.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,600
So I'm sure there'll be
plenty for me to write about.

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
Well. And you think it's a good idea
for your country to join the war?

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,100
Not if it means fighting you Germans.

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
You seem to be pretty good at it.

44
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,100
I will go get the car.

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,900
Did you have to provoke him?

46
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
I thought you said he was a diplomat.

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
No, I said he was attached to the consulate.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,500
He's an engineer.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Stop him! He's with the resistance!

50
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,700
Welcome to Shanghai.

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Leni, komm!

52
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Shanghai was about the only place left in China

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,300
the Japanese hadn't taken over.

54
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,100
Everybody knew

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
it was only a matter of time before they
swallowed it whole.

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Officially the guerilla war between the Chinese
and the Japanese

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,600
was none of our business.

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
So, like a good American,

59
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,900
I kept my head down and remained neutral.

60
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,800
Shanghai was divided up into sectors.

61
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,400
Drink in the British zone,

62
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
eat in the French zone...

63
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
...spy in the German zone...

64
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
...but stay the hell away from the Japanese.

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,600
Naval Intelligence had sent me to Shanghai

66
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,900
to help out an agent who was in trouble.

67
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,400
He was my oldest and best friend.

68
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
His name was Conner.

69
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm gonna get you out tonight.

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,500
The storm had blown over by the time
I got to the casino.

71
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,200
In Shanghai, things change pretty fast.

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
The routine with Conner was always the same.

73
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,300
We'd meet in the biggest casino in town.

74
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,100
The loser would buy dinner.

75
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,300
Chip request for the lady.

76
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
Chip request for the lady.

77
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,000
Follow by 500

78
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
That is 550.

79
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm Out

80
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,900
You're working pretty hard to bully me out
of my 50.

81
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
What did you say?

82
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, I said, I'll see your 500...

83
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,900
...and raise you whatever I have left.

84
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
300 and something.

85
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,000
Why don't you keep your something
for your taxi home?

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
It's a short walk to my hotel.

87
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,100
Three nines.

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Three queens for the lady.

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Avery appropriate hand.

90
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
Avery appropriate hand.

91
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
You must have brought me luck.

92
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,100
No second chance?

93
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Not tonight.

94
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Deal me out, boys.

95
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Leave him.

96
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
You all right, sir?

97
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,000
Lieutenant Collins. Captain Astor sent me.

98
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,600
So we finally got you out of Berlin.

99
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
How was your trip?

100
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,300
Glorious. Except half the Gestapo was
on the ship with me.

101
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,200
Come on in. Let me get you a drink.

102
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,900
Where the hell is Conner?

103
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
He was supposed to meet me at the casino.

104
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,600
He was found earlier in the Japanese sector.

105
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
I guess he was on his way to meet you.

106
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,200
You know, this whole country
has its head buried in the sand.

107
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
The Germans are getting
ready to march in Europe...

108
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,400
...and all we care about is whether or not the
Yankees beat the Giants.

109
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,200
I mean, what have we done with our lives?

110
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
I called Naval headquarters this morning.

111
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
I volunteered us both for Intelligence.

112
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Conner and I had joined the Navy

113
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,300
like our fathers and grandfathers before us.

114
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
Our lives were set.

115
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,500
Birth, school, Yale, war.

116
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
The great American tradition.

117
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
He was investigating a local gang lord called
Anthony Lan-Ting.

118
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,400
He's the boss of the Shanghai Triad.

119
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,000
He has a deal with the Japanese.

120
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,400
They leave him alone...

121
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,500
...and whenever the Japanese need
any dirty work done they go to him.

122
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,300
I'd like to read all of Conner's reports.

123
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
He hadn't briefed us in a month.

124
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,100
That's why I sent for you.

125
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,100
I was under a lot of pressure
to have him reassigned.

126
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,400
Why?

127
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Because the situation here

128
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,800
isn't just black and white.

129
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
You got the Chinese fighting the Japanese.

130
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,900
Us, we're caught somewhere in the middle.

131
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Now the truth is,

132
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,600
the Japanese want to walk into our zone...

133
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
...there's nothing we can do about it.

134
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,200
So sometimes,

135
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,800
our only option is just to sit back and
not rock the boat.

136
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
And that wasn't Conner's style.

137
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Any informers?

138
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,100
Yeah.

139
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
He's got a contact at the Japanese consulate...

140
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,500
...a diplomat called Kita.

141
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,400
We've already spoken to him.

142
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,300
I'd like to speak to him myself.

143
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,500
And I'll need an introduction to Lan-Ting.

144
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,900
Apart from his own people,

145
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
he only mixes with the
Germans and the Japanese.

146
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,700
I know plenty of Germans.

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
When do I start at the Herald?

148
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,800
In Berlin, I played the part of a journalist
with Nazi sympathies...

149
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
...and I was doing it again
at the Shanghai Herald.

150
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,100
Mr. Soames was the Washington
Post's correspondent

151
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
in Berlin before he joined us.

152
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm sure most of you are already familiar
with his reputation.

153
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,100
Those who aren't

154
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,700
will have a chance to find out for themselves
in good time.

155
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,100
Right. Back to work.

156
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,000
How's it going, boys?

157
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,700
Paul Soames, Shanghai Herald.

158
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,100
Yeah, we set the meet with
Conner's Japanese contact, Kita.

159
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,200
You got a pen?

160
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,100
Where is it?

161
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
A place called the Bamboo Tea
House in the Japanese district.

162
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,300
He meets his girlfriend there...

163
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
...everyday at 3:00 p.m.

164
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,400
At all clear,

165
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,900
he will open a book on the porch.

166
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,700
Paul, listen to me.

167
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,900
You'll be in the heart of the Japanese sector.

168
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,700
You be careful over there.

169
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,100
Tell us what you know about the resistance

170
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,300
Take him...

171
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,600
...in for questioning!

172
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,200
Papers.

173
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,500
Papers.

174
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,000
Move.

175
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,500
Move. You're under arrest.

176
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
"No threat to American interests"?

177
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,100
Sir?

178
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,900
You probably know this already, Mr. Soames...

179
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,600
...but when the owners of this
newspaper told me to hire you,

180
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,300
I threatened to resign.

181
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
The only reason I didn't

182
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,300
was because I wanted to
meet you face to face...

183
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,900
...and see if you really
believe this crap you write.

184
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,200
My office!

185
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
"Germany and Japan are no more our enemies

186
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
than Britain and Russia are our friends.

187
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,900
In a war of this magnitude

188
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,200
our only concern should be for ourselves."

189
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,800
The Japanese foreign minister

190
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
met with the German
foreign minister yesterday...

191
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,300
...and one of the subjects they discussed

192
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
was whether my Jewish wife...

193
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,900
...should wear a yellow star on her jacket

194
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,300
and be herded into a Shanghai ghetto...

195
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,900
...along with the rest of her kind.

196
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,500
Now I think that should be a concern...

197
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,800
...for every civilized country in the world,
even America.

198
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,600
I'm not a Nazi,
if that's your implication, Mr. Sanger.

199
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,000
I've lived in Germany far too long

200
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,700
to have any illusions about
what kind of people they are.

201
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,500
Now you can fire me, you can censor me...

202
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,600
I have no intention of firing you.

203
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,200
Write something that doesn't make my stomach
turn and I'll print it...

204
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,100
...otherwise you can type
your fingers raw for all I care.

205
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,900
Will that be all, sir?

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,100
Yeah, get out.

207
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,700
Oh, and this came for you.

208
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,400
At least your Nazi friends are impressed.

209
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,900
Mrs.
Mueller, thank you so much for the invitation.

210
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
It's lovely to see you, Mr. Soames.

211
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,500
My pleasure. Mr. Mueller.

212
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,800
Mr. Soames.

213
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,300
A party at the German embassy

214
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,500
could make one night feel like a thousand years.

215
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Laughing at all their jokes

216
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,800
was like eating breakfast from the gutter.

217
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,500
The way I see it, for America to join the war...

218
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,400
...would be like a man who's never

219
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
been in a relationship interfering
in a 50 year marriage.

220
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,500
Thank you for a wonderful party,
Your Excellency.

221
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm glad you're enjoying it, Mr. Lan-Ting.

222
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,200
You know everyone here, don't you?

223
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,200
Paul Soames.

224
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,500
Anthony Lan-Ting.

225
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Gentlemen, excuse me.

226
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
These affairs had quite a guest list.

227
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,800
Nazis, Japanese imperialists,
the Triads, Kempeitai.

228
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,700
They were all connected.

229
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,100
Any of them could have killed Conner.

230
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,000
I had to get in between them.

231
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,700
It was like being a worm,

232
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,600
working your way into a rotten apple.

233
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,600
Please tell me you're not
politicians or diplomats.

234
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,300
If you are a politician or a diplomat,

235
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,900
it doesn't matter how beautiful
or charming you are...

236
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,400
...I just cannot talk to you,

237
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
I couldn't bear it.

238
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm afraid they can't speak a word of English,
Mr. Soames.

239
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,700
No?

240
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,300
Let me introduce you properly.

241
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,900
These are my cousins Shin Shin and Lili.

242
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,100
And this is my friend Captain Tanaka...

243
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,800
...a politician and a diplomat, I'm afraid.

244
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,800
Captain, it's a pleasure to meet you.

245
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,600
I hope I didn't offend you, sir.

246
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,100
If there's anything else
you'd like to ask the girls...

247
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,700
...l'd be happy to translate.

248
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,400
Well, now that I know you're related to them,

249
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

250
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,700
Excuse me.

251
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,700
Captain.

252
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,300
Japan is as deserving of an empire in the East...

253
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,600
...as Germany is of an empire in the West.

254
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So...

255
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,100
...how does a writer for the Shanghai Herald

256
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,300
get asked to the German Consulate?

257
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,800
Some friends invited me.

258
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Well, the truth is I'm only friends

259
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
with the lonely-looking fr?
Ulein in the black dress.

260
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Oh, I see.

261
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,100
A toast to the Emperor...

262
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
...and the Führer!

263
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,700
Honorable men all.

264
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,100
May they rot in hell.

265
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,900
And now, some music.

266
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Anna!

267
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm sorry I'm late.

268
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,400
My appointments ran late.

269
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,200
That's okay.

270
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,400
Darling, this is my friend, Paul Soames.

271
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,800
My wife Anna.

272
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,900
How do you do?

273
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,600
It's a pleasure to meet you.

274
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,100
What did you decide?

275
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,000
I thought we'd take them to the fashion show
at the Casino.

276
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,600
So...

277
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,000
...how do you know my husband?

278
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,900
Actually we just met.

279
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh, I thought you were old friends.

280
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
It certainly feels that way.

281
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,200
Shall I get you something to drink?

282
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,800
I'd like to dance before I do anything else.

283
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
Will you dance with me, darling?

284
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,300
You should ask Mr. Soames.

285
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,300
Mr. Soames?

286
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,200
I'd be delighted.

287
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,000
Thank you, Anthony.

288
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,100
You're welcome.

289
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,300
My husband doesn't always trust people
he's just met.

290
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
How did you charm him so quickly?

291
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He and his cousins

292
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,500
just seemed like the most interesting
people here tonight.

293
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,200
They're not his cousins.

294
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,200
No?

295
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,900
They're his mistresses.

296
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Anthony doesn't know I gamble.

297
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,300
He'd be very upset if he found out.

298
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,300
I have no intention of telling him.

299
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,100
Good. Thank you.

300
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,200
I like secrets. I collect them.

301
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,700
Fascinating.

302
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Why were you following me at the casino?

303
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,100
I had no idea you were married.

304
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
And who was your friend with the cigarette case?

305
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
A question for a question.

306
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
Well, it's like poker.

307
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
You have to pay to see my hand.

308
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,500
What game are we playing, Mr. Soames?

309
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,300
Paul.

310
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
Leni. I thought you'd left.

311
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
No, no, no.

312
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,800
Leni Mueller, this is Mrs. Anthony Lan-Ting.

313
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
How do you do?

314
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,300
I should get back to my husband.

315
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,300
Of course. Thank you for the dance.

316
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Not at all.

317
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,500
She doesn't look very married.

318
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,900
Neither do you.

319
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Drop me off at the harbor.

320
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,200
Kita was Conner's only known contact.

321
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,800
I figured if Conner trusted him,
I probably could too.

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So I found us a quiet place to talk.

323
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,100
What do you want to tell me?

324
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,100
I was helping Conner.

325
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,000
In exchange he promised me
an American passport.

326
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I was supposed to get it a year ago.

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
He said he would help me.

328
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,200
Uh-huh. Well, we're here to help.

329
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,200
Keep talking.

330
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Conner called me a few days before he died.

331
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,900
He needed a checkpoint pass for a friend.

332
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,800
His friend was Japanese.

333
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,700
He was trying to smuggle her out of Shanghai.

334
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,000
He told me not to tell anyone.

335
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
After he was killed I was scared

336
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,600
you'd think I set him up.

337
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
What'd you do with the pass?

338
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,500
I took it to the apartment in Chapei like he said.

339
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,700
What apartment?

340
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,600
Conner lived in the International Settlement.

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,700
He gave me an address in Chapei.

342
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,800
When I went, there was nobody there.

343
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,100
I can prove it. I still have the pass.

344
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,500
This was Conner's girlfriend.

345
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,300
Her name is Sumiko.

346
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
I can show you where the apartment is.

347
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,600
So all Conner wanted was a checkpoint pass?

348
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
Was he working on anything else?

349
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Just routine naval intelligence.

350
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
He had me report on the
Emperor's East China Fleet.

351
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,400
He never told me what the information was for

352
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,900
and I never asked.

353
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,500
Just ask them if they ever saw him
with a young woman.

354
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,800
According to the neighbors,

355
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the girl disappeared the night Conner was killed.
She set him up.

356
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,500
Must have rented another room.

357
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,900
An attic or a basement.

358
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,700
Anywhere he could have used as a darkroom.

359
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,100
So why didn't the girl hand these over
when she turned him in?

360
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,700
Maybe Conner still had enough sense not
to tell her everything.

361
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
I saw this man

362
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,600
with Lan-Ting at the German Consulate.

363
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,500
His name's Tanaka.

364
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,000
He's head of Japanese Intelligence for Shanghai.

365
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,200
These are Navy and Air Corps officers here.

366
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,200
We should find out who the
other men are in that picture.

367
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,000
Tanaka's saluting them,
they've gotta be ranking officers.

368
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,100
That's Lan-Ting's wife.

369
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
Her father was a respected politician till
the Japanese took him out.

370
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
They would have killed her too

371
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,300
but her family arranged for her to marry Lan-Ting.

372
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
He protects her.

373
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
Anna was everywhere...

374
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,900
...in the city...

375
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,700
...but she always seemed
to be hiding something.

376
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,500
So I did what you do with a puzzle.

377
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I stared at it until it made sense.

378
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
I have to see what that Japanese bastard wants

379
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,200
No, not now!

380
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,100
This will just take a minute.

381
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
I'll be right back.

382
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,100
Anthony, get down! Get down!

383
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,600
Anthony!

384
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,700
Anthony!

385
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,100
Paul, come in.

386
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,000
You're lucky the bastards
couldn't shoot straight.

387
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,000
Even luckier that you were there.

388
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,500
Who do I have to thank for that?

389
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
The fr? Ulein I told you about last week.

390
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,900
I was supposed to meet her at the fashion show
and she stood me up.

391
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,800
Perhaps her husband sent
those gunmen after you.

392
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
Did you found out who they were?

393
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I will.

394
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Captain, please come in.

395
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,900
Why don't you show Mr.
Soames around the house

396
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,800
until we're ready for dinner?

397
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,300
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

398
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,200
Your hand. Here.

399
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,600
Thank you.

400
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,900
Did you know any of the men who died today?

401
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,900
They were Japanese.

402
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,900
I meant the others.

403
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,800
I recognized your friends from the casino.

404
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,700
Why didn't you tell Anthony?

405
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,900
I wasn't quite sure what to tell him.

406
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Does Anthony know you're
working for the resistance?

407
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
I'd never do anything to hurt him.

408
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,900
Your friends didn't seem quite so discriminating.

409
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,500
They murdered several men in cold blood.

410
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,100
Did you know one of the gunmen survived?

411
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,200
What will you do if he talks?

412
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,100
Maybe I can help you.

413
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,800
Every time you've come to me for help

414
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,900
I've done what you asked.

415
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,600
I'm doing everything I can to find her.

416
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,800
You said you could handle this.

417
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,100
You walk into my house

418
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
and give me orders in front of my own men?

419
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,700
What does Tanaka want from you?

420
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,500
He thinks the resistance is close to me.

421
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,700
How could he think that?

422
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,700
Tanaka has one of the gunmen

423
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
and is beating him for information.

424
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,800
Who knows what lies he is saying?

425
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I give Tanaka everything

426
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
and he humiliates me in return.

427
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Forgive us for speaking Chinese.

428
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,300
How do you like the food?

429
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
It's sensational.

430
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,900
In fact, it reminds me... just how bad the food
is at the Casanova.

431
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
The Casanova?

432
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,600
That's my local restaurant.
I go there for the waiters.

433
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,700
I dine alone each night,

434
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and yet they insist on setting two places.

435
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm supposed to meet a
friend at the Cathay later.

436
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
I can give you a lift back into town.

437
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
That'd be very kind. Thank you.

438
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,700
You can't go into town tonight, darling.

439
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,900
It's too dangerous after what happened.

440
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,900
I don't know how to reach her.

441
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,100
I'm happy to pass a message to her if you like,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

442
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
It's no problem at all, the Cathay's on my way.

443
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
I can stop in.

444
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,500
I hope I can see you soon.

445
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,100
I look forward to that, Anthony.

446
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,300
Thank you for saving his life.

447
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
Chip request.

448
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Where are we going?

449
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,900
Hurry! We're getting out of here.

450
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,900
Please don't kill me.

451
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,100
Drive!

452
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,800
The Japanese will be here soon!

453
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,800
It seemed Anna wasn't worried about
the Japanese coming after her.

454
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,600
She was worried they'd find whoever was
hiding under that hood.

455
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,300
She better be here as you say!

456
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,300
This is the place. She's here!

457
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,600
We don't have time for games!

458
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I don't understand.

459
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
They must have moved her! Captain!

460
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
She was here. I swear!
Captain! Please believe me.

461
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,900
Please, Captain!

462
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,500
I'll find her for you.

463
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,500
I trust your message was delivered.

464
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm grateful for what you did.

465
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,600
Does that entitle me to a few more answers?

466
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,700
No.

467
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I've been doing some homework on you.

468
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
I read your stories about the war in Europe.

469
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,600
You write well.

470
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,000
Thank you.

471
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,200
But you don't seem to believe in much.

472
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
The story you should be writing

473
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,300
is what the Japanese are doing in Shanghai.

474
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,100
The Japanese murdered thousands
of people in Nanjing.

475
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,200
And soon, they'll do the same thing here.

476
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,500
That's why we are fighting.

477
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,500
You find this amusing?

478
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,800
No, no. It's just that you just remind me
of a friend of mine.

479
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,900
In what way?

480
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,000
The way you argue.

481
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
He was a force of nature.

482
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,400
He'd come at you from all sides
until you surrendered.

483
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,600
So I should be writing about Captain Tanaka?

484
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,100
He usually has a hand in everything
that happens in Shanghai.

485
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,700
Was he head of Shanghai Intelligence
when your father was killed?

486
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,300
I did a little homework of my own.

487
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
Sounds like he was a remarkable man.

488
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,100
It must have taken a lot of courage

489
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
to speak out against
Japanese atrocities in Nanjing.

490
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,800
He just cared deeply about this country.

491
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,900
Anthony loves American jazz.

492
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Are you still in love with him?

493
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,700
I wouldn't be with him if I wasn't.

494
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,900
I only ask because you seem to be
on your own a lot.

495
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,200
I'll take this.

496
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,300
Our informants haven't found

497
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,900
any information on the Japanese girl
who betrayed Conner.

498
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,500
What about the men saluting Tanaka?

499
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Well, they're officers from
the aircraft carrier Kaga.

500
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,100
The Kaga?

501
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,700
We checked it out.

502
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
They were in Shanghai last month for R&R.

503
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,800
There's nothing secret about it.

504
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,000
Look, Tanaka is in charge of security
for visiting personnel.

505
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,900
He's probably just telling them what bars
they can and can't go to.

506
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,000
Conner wouldn't have taken pictures
of it if it wasn't important.

507
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,000
He was interested in Tanaka for a reason.

508
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,100
Paul, I know you don't want to hear this,

509
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,700
But this profession catches up with all of us.

510
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,800
Maybe Conner made the wrong call.

511
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,700
He didn't make mistakes like this, Richard.

512
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,700
You know, the first article I ever wrote

513
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
for the Herald was about your mother.

514
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,200
The Garbo of Shanghai, I called her.

515
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,800
Well, perhaps I'll have to dream up
a name for you, too.

516
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,600
Just finishing up some work back here, sir.

517
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,000
Why don't you wait in my office?

518
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,900
She's a friend of the family.

519
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,500
I'm helping her with her passport application.

520
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,200
I understand. I'll just finish up.

521
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,600
So if you'll just... Yes.

522
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,600
Lock up when you go.

523
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,100
I needed to see Shanghai
through Conner's eyes.

524
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,400
The only port in the world

525
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,900
that would take in 20,000
Jews on the run from Hitler...

526
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,600
...as the Japanese and the Chinese were
engaged in street warfare.

527
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
Dead bodies piled up.

528
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,800
Westerners walked over them and
went about their business.

529
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,900
To survive Shanghai, you needed to
understand her contradictions.

530
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,500
I showed these to the ambassador.

531
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,300
He doesn't think they
warrant any form of protest.

532
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,100
"Having analyzed these photographs

533
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,100
I conclude that the SS methods...

534
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,100
...for pacifying an occupied country
are exceedingly simple.

535
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,700
Families are picked at random...

536
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,000
...taken to a place of execution

537
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
and then forced to dig their own graves.

538
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,900
And if they happen to be Jewish...

539
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,900
...then the children are shot in front
of their parents first."

540
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,500
You gonna beat the German army on your own?

541
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,000
Forget the Germans.
We've already lost in Europe.

542
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,900
No, I'm talking about the Far East.

543
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,100
The Far East,
that's where the next battleground is.

544
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
Now, if we wanna beat them

545
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,200
We're gonna have to sink to their level.

546
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,400
Do whatever's necessary and
if our superiors don't like it,

547
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,900
then they don't have to know.

548
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,700
These sons of bitches have opened my eyes.

549
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,700
There's a lady to see you, sir, in the lobby.

550
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,900
Why didn't Karl take you with him?

551
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,600
What would I do in Tokyo?

552
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,000
Drink tea with the wives,

553
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
try to understand their English?

554
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,600
I wish you'd told me you were coming.

555
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,000
I would have cancelled my dinner plans.

556
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Thank you.

557
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,600
What's this?

558
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,400
It's not what you think it is.

559
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,100
Of course it is.

560
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,600
No.

561
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,300
I've put Karl through hell these past weeks.

562
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,300
Men always seem to notice when
you're not in love with them any more.

563
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,300
And he's been so preoccupied with his work.

564
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,300
A bad day at the office doesn't justify that.

565
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,400
It wasn't a bad day.

566
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,700
We've had the Japanese stay at our house ever
since we arrived.

567
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,500
They've been drinking our champagne,
eating our caviar

568
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,200
and no word of thanks.

569
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,600
Why doesn't Karl say something?

570
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,000
He has to be nice to them.

571
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,400
Our navy sold them
something that doesn't work...

572
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,600
...and now he has to fix it.

573
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
I didn't realize he was a naval engineer.

574
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,500
Can we please stop talking about him?

575
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,700
What are you thinking?

576
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,400
I'm thinking...

577
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,900
...about where to take you for dinner.

578
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,700
I thought you had plans.

579
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,200
Well, something came up.

580
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,000
It's them!

581
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,500
Drive on.

582
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,000
Fireworks.

583
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
There's this lovely little bar I
know on the Rue Lafayette.

584
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,500
I thought we'd go there for a nightcap...

585
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,500
...and then back to your place.

586
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,700
What?

587
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,200
I have staff.

588
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,100
Smuggle me past your staff.

589
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,100
Hello, Mr. Soames.

590
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,400
Mrs. Lan-Ting. How are you?

591
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Very well, thank you.

592
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
You remember Mrs. Mueller.

593
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,600
Yes, of course.

594
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,100
Would you like to join us?
Would you like to sit down?

595
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,400
I'm meeting some friends.

596
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,200
Is Anthony with you?

597
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,200
Not tonight.

598
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,900
My husband and I are having a party next week.

599
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,900
We'd love to see you if you're free.

600
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,300
My pleasure.

601
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,400
Good.

602
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,400
"Type 91 torpedoes transferred
to the aircraft carrier Kaga...

603
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,300
...October 28th, 1941, Shanghai."

604
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,400
I don't even know what this tells us.

605
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,600
This tells us the officers of the Kaga

606
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,800
didn't come to Shanghai for the night life.

607
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,400
Conner worked it all out.

608
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,700
Look at the date.

609
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,900
The torpedoes were delivered two
days after Conner took those photos.

610
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,700
The Germans and the Japanese are allies.

611
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,300
They sell each other weapons all the time.

612
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,100
These are not ordinary weapon.

613
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,300
You got 800 kilogram torpedoes.

614
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,600
You've got naval engineers on both sides

615
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,300
making adjustments to maximize the accuracy.

616
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,700
Let's suppose that he
stumbled on an arms deal.

617
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,200
What would you like me to do?

618
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,700
Find out where the Kaga is.

619
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,100
I already did.

620
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,200
She's been with the East
China fleet the whole time.

621
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,100
She hasn't moved in months.

622
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,100
Look, find out who killed him...

623
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,900
...and I will do everything in my power
to make them pay...

624
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,500
...but I can't declare war on Japan over these.

625
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,500
I hope I'm not crashing the party.

626
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,700
I wasn't sure if you'd invited me the other night.

627
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,500
I invited Miss Mueller.

628
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,100
Mrs. Mueller.

629
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,300
Did your friends ever show up?

630
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
You think I came to see you?

631
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,000
If I'm to be honest, I stayed up all night
wondering if you did.

632
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm wise to your charms, Mr. Soames.

633
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,200
Don't forget I heard you in
action with Miss Mueller.

634
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,000
Mrs. Mueller.

635
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,800
Listen, if I say something that offends you,

636
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,300
please just smile and walk way...

637
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,800
...because I would hate to get slapped in front
of all your guests.

638
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,400
Maybe you shouldn't say it.

639
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,600
I wanna see you again.

640
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,500
Are you flirting with my wife now?

641
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,300
Absolutely.

642
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,000
How's your arm?

643
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,000
It's already healed.

644
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,900
I'm glad.

645
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Darling

646
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,900
...will you ask the girls to dance
with our Japanese guests?

647
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,700
Okay.

648
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,300
Let's talk.

649
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,200
A few years ago I'd have cut his throat
for even looking at her.

650
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,200
Anna told me she saw you at the
Casanova Restaurant last Tuesday.

651
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,800
That's right. She did.

652
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,200
She caught me having dinner
with my German friend.

653
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Will you confirm that to Captain Tanaka?

654
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,900
Of course.

655
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Thank you.

656
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Is everything all right?

657
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,000
Japanese diplomats were assassinated
that night.

658
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Captain Tanaka thinks

659
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,800
someone close to me told the resistance
where to find them.

660
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,800
He wants me to account for the movements
of all my men.

661
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,800
Surely not your wife?

662
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
My wife,

663
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,600
my friends...

664
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,700
...myself.

665
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Mrs...

666
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,500
Excuse me, Captain.

667
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,000
You're not enjoying the party, Mr. Soames?

668
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,800
You look like you're hiding out as well.

669
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,300
I'm too old to make a fool of myself
on the dance floor.

670
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,100
You're welcome to come in and hide with me.

671
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,000
We will have our own drinks.

672
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Thank you.

673
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,400
I'm sorry. I was looking for my husband.

674
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,600
He's in the living room, I believe.

675
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,000
I've never seen so many men make fools
of themselves over somebody.

676
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,300
She talks to ten of them at the same time...

677
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,600
...and they all think they're the only one
she's interested in.

678
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,600
That's part of her charm.

679
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,700
You think it's as innocent as that?

680
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,300
Her husband tells me you spent Tuesday night
with her.

681
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,700
No, no, not with her unfortunately.

682
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,100
I just ran into her at the same restaurant,
the Casanova.

683
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,000
Are you married, Mr. Soames?

684
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,200
I was. A long time ago.

685
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,400
My wife ran off with another man

686
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,200
two days before we were due to leave
for Shanghai.

687
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,700
I'm sorry.

688
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,600
Did yours break your heart?

689
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,500
From what I remember.

690
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,900
Women always win in the end.

691
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,300
They forget us more easily.

692
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,400
Mine certainly did that.

693
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,400
To nobody ever making fools of us again.

694
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,900
Do you think it's possible to fall in love
like that again?

695
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,700
Well, I don't think it'll ever be as maddening
as the first time.

696
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,600
I disagree.

697
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,400
I think the second time might be worse
for men like us.

698
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,900
What kind of men are we?

699
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,200
Romantics.

700
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,900
We are so eager to get over the pain
of the first betrayal...

701
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,300
...we'll walk blindly into the next.

702
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,400
You don't remember how long Mrs.
Lan-Ting stayed at the restaurant?

703
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,800
If I can recall,
she was there the entire time we were.

704
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,700
About nine to midnight.

705
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,500
The Chinese use these to
light their opium candles.

706
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,400
I'm always burning myself.

707
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,700
I think I will have one.

708
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,800
Fireworks.

709
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,000
I told you.

710
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,700
I must check on our guests.

711
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,100
Alright.

712
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,800
You're leaving so soon?

713
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,800
Yeah, think so.

714
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,600
You were talking to Captain Tanaka?

715
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,200
Yes. We were both admiring your skill...

716
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,700
...at convincing every man in the room that he
meant something to you.

717
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,300
Surely that's what every good hostess does?

718
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,900
He seemed to imply there
was more to it than that.

719
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,000
In fact, he warned me to stay away from you.

720
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,500
Why would he do that?

721
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,600
He probably thinks

722
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,600
I'm some idiot American who'd be crazy enough
to lie for you.

723
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,100
And are you?

724
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,600
I think we both know the
answer to that question.

725
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,100
Thanks for the party.

726
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,300
So what's this article of yours about, Mister...?

727
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,200
Opium addiction amongst the various armed
forces in Shanghai.

728
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,700
Just take a look. Does he come here?

729
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,700
I wouldn't waste your time

730
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,600
writing an expose on your Japanese friend...

731
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,900
...if that's what you're doing. He never
touched the stuff.

732
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,800
He only came here because
of his little Geisha girl.

733
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,300
Sumiko, wasn't it, Mikey?

734
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,000
Mikey here used to spy on them all the time.

735
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,100
He even drilled his own little peephole
through their private booth,

736
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,200
didn't you, peepo?

737
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,100
She couldn't get enough of the stuff.

738
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,300
Is that the girl?

739
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,000
When was the last time you
saw them here together?

740
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,700
A few weeks ago.

741
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
It's nothing like Ralphie told you.

742
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,500
I only peeped on them once or twice.

743
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,800
There was something sad about them.

744
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,500
She'd lie there all doped out of her mind and...

745
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,300
...her Japanese friend would hold her hands,
whispering.

746
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,600
Whispering what?

747
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,400
Whatever came into his head.

748
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,700
How she was his future, his second chance.

749
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,600
Did she ever come in here with an American?

750
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,500
Tall, good-looking, dark hair?

751
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,700
Mikey's the only tall, good-looking American
around here.

752
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I felt like I was following
Conner down a dark alley.

753
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,100
Tanaka's mistress must have been off limits
to anybody but a fool.

754
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,500
Conner was a lot of things, but he wasn't a fool.

755
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,400
Conner was investigating a ship called the Kaga
before he died.

756
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,600
I need you to find out
everything you can about her.

757
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,600
Also all the intelligence you
have on the East China Fleet.

758
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
No, they transferred me three times this month.

759
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,500
I think they're testing me.

760
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,800
They're not testing you. Embassies rotate staff
all the time.

761
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,900
It's just precautionary.

762
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,200
Just do this one more thing and we're gonna
get you out.

763
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,500
I need a second passport. That's all I ask.

764
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,600
I'm getting married.

765
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,600
Well, get me a look at the Kaga

766
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
and I'll consider it your wedding present.

767
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
I'm gonna arrange for the passports myself.

768
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,900
It's the last thing you have to do for us.

769
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,400
You have my word on that.

770
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,300
Over there.

771
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,300
Wait a minute. The Kaga's not there.

772
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,600
Here, take a look.

773
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,200
There are other ships missing.

774
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,100
Which ones

775
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,200
The Akagi, it's a carrier.

776
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,300
The destroyers and two tankers.

777
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,100
Is your list up to date?

778
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,800
It was dated the first of November.

779
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,300
Richard, we got nine
Japanese warships missing.

780
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,300
You combine all these ships and you have
yourself a long-range attack formation.

781
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,600
The destroyers protect the carriers,

782
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,900
the tankers refuel them at the center...

783
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,200
...you got a fleet of fighter planes,
each carrying 800 kilogram torpedoes.

784
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,200
They're pulling ships from their main fleet

785
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,000
and we have no idea where they are.

786
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,600
I have a pretty damn good idea.

787
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,500
I checked with our code-breaking
units in Washington.

788
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
None of these ships have been issued orders
in the last month...

789
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,500
...which means they're probably back

790
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,900
at their bases undergoing repairs.

791
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,100
They're hiding the fact that
their ships are incapacitated.

792
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,500
A Japanese delegation is
in Washington right now

793
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,900
trying to negotiate a withdrawal from China.

794
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,300
Our oil embargo has
brought them to their knees.

795
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,200
They're desperate to get any concessions they
can out of us.

796
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,200
The last thing they want us to know

797
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,000
is that their fleet is under-powered.

798
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,100
I'm late for a meeting. We'll talk about this later.

799
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,200
Conner's been right every step of the way.

800
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,800
Every time we doubted
him he's proved us wrong.

801
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
We need to watch Tanaka 24 hours a day.

802
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,000
Maybe if you had come to me sooner
I could have backed you up.

803
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,800
The same way you backed up Conner?

804
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,300
What is that supposed to mean?

805
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,300
He was watching the Kaga for weeks.
For weeks, Richard.

806
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,700
And he never told you a goddamn thing,
why is that?

807
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,200
Well, how the hell can I back him up if he
wouldn't even talk to me?

808
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,600
Look, I don't wanna believe

809
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,300
that Conner died in vain any more that you do...

810
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,800
...but I can't ignore the facts.

811
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,100
He fell in love with a Japanese spy

812
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,300
and she betrayed him, and that's all we've got.

813
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,400
What if she was spying for us?

814
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,900
We've always assumed she seduced Conner.

815
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,000
What if it was the other way around?

816
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,600
You don't know that.

817
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,600
We know she was Tanaka's mistress.

818
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,200
I think Conner found out about them while
he was tailing Lan-Ting.

819
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,600
He saw an opportunity and he
took it and he seduced the girl.

820
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,100
Now what if everything Tanaka ever told
her got back to Conner through her?

821
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,400
Even if you're right, she's probably dead.

822
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,000
And what if she's alive?

823
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,300
If she's on the run I can find her.

824
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,100
Thank you, gentlemen.

825
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,100
The meeting's over, Mr. Soames.

826
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,400
I need to speak with you, sir.

827
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,800
Make an appointment like everyone else.

828
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

829
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,300
If I needed to smuggle
someone out of Shanghai...

830
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,000
...where would I go for documents?

831
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,100
Why are you asking me?

832
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,900
The young lady I saw you with the other night,

833
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,700
you said you were helping her with her passport.

834
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,000
I didn't say I was doing it illegally.

835
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't know any other way you could be doing it.

836
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,900
The British and American Consulate have
stopped issuing papers.

837
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,300
A friend of mine's in trouble with the
Japanese authorities.

838
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,700
I need to get him out of Shanghai now.

839
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,600
I'm sorry, I can't help.

840
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,100
Maybe your wife can.

841
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,200
Are you blackmailing me?

842
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,300
Not unless I have to.

843
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,000
I don't care what you think about me...

844
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,200
...but if you turn these people down...

845
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,500
...their lives are on your conscience.

846
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,600
Quite an impressive operation
you've got here, Billy.

847
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,600
Thank you.

848
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,600
You can tell the war's coming to Shanghai

849
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,500
by the number of faces on my wall.

850
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,600
I have a waiting list of 300.

851
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,800
You're lucky you're a friend of Ben's.

852
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
I know.

853
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,600
This one won't be convincing.

854
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,700
She's not facing the camera.

855
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,100
It's the best I could do.

856
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,300
Do you get many Japanese clients?

857
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,600
Mostly the Japanese are
happy to stay where they are.

858
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,200
Why?

859
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,900
An old buddy of mine was trying to smuggle his
girlfriend out of Shanghai.

860
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,300
I was wondering if they came to you.

861
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,700
Everyone comes to me.

862
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,100
You keep records?

863
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,800
I'd love to find the son of a bitch.
He owes me a fortune.

864
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,400
I'm sorry. I guarantee confidentiality.

865
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,900
You'll thank me for it yourself one day.

866
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,900
Sir, have any change?

867
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,700
Mr. Soames.

868
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,500
You fainted.

869
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
I fainted.

870
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Let me see.

871
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Does he take over when you're done?

872
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,400
Only if I don't find out why
you were following me.

873
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,900
I wanted to see where you
were taking the girl's passport.

874
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,100
Which girl?

875
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,600
Captain Tanaka's mistress.

876
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,100
Look, Anna.

877
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,100
I followed your man to the safe house after
I delivered your message to the casino.

878
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,300
I actually saw them taking her away.

879
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,800
I didn't realize it at the time...

880
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,700
...because they'd thrown
a blanket over her head.

881
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:02,900
Leave us alone, please.

882
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,600
Why are you interested in her?

883
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,800
She was also having an
affair with a friend of mine...

884
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,400
...and he was murdered the
night Sumiko disappeared.

885
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,200
We had nothing to do with it.

886
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,800
I'd like to hear that from her.

887
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,100
You're in no position to make demands,
Mr. Soames.

888
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,500
Why are you doing it? Why'd you kidnap her?

889
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,000
Tanaka has arrested hundreds of our people.

890
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,500
We are going to trade her for them.

891
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,000
There's something you need to understand,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

892
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,100
Tanaka isn't negotiating

893
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,700
and he isn't interested in getting this girl back.

894
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,800
He wants her dead.

895
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,200
She wasn't just his mistress.

896
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,700
She was spying on him.

897
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,800
Why should I believe you?

898
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,300
Because my friend was an American agent.

899
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,800
Whatever it is she knows

900
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,000
Tanaka won't stop till he finds her...

901
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,100
...and when he does,
he won't leave any of you alive to talk about it.

902
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,400
Just show me where she is.

903
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,100
I promise you I'll do what I can to help.

904
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,900
I need more time.

905
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,500
You don't have time.

906
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,100
If she's in Shanghai,

907
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,500
Tanaka's going to find her.
No matter what you do, he'll be waiting.

908
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,800
Do you understand?

909
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,200
Do you understand?

910
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,100
I'll call you at your hotel this afternoon.

911
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,300
Please...

912
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,000
don't follow me again.

913
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,900
I had no business thinking about her.

914
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,700
But I couldn't help myself.

915
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,800
I knew it was a mistake.

916
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
But I remembered an old saying...

917
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
...The heart is never neutral.

918
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,700
Let's go.

919
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,400
Passport.

920
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,900
The Japanese were allowing only
one train a week to leave Shanghai.

921
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,900
I got the passports for Kita and his girlfriend.

922
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,500
And I arranged for them to be on it

923
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,900
I was delivering on a promise made by Conner.

924
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,200
It felt like the one decent thing I could do

925
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,600
U.S. Citizen.

926
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,700
Go. Hurry.

927
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,300
Okay.

928
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,200
Excuse me!

929
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,400
Create a diversion!

930
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,200
Papers!

931
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
Get her on the train, I'll meet you as planned.

932
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,300
Nobody boards...

933
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,500
...without papers!

934
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
Resistance!

935
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,200
Get her out of here!

936
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,400
We have to split up! I'll take her.

937
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,900
Go!

938
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,400
Let me out.

939
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,400
Let me out.

940
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,100
I'm an American citizen!

941
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,000
That's my wife! U.S. Passport! U.S. Passport!

942
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,700
Go

943
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,600
Why didn't you call me?

944
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,200
My people didn't think they could trust you.

945
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,200
We needed to move the girl

946
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:16,900
So you told them,

947
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,400
"I'll smuggle her out of Shanghai and everything
will work out fine"

948
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,200
Is that it?

949
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,000
You don't understand

950
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,900
That's quite a risk you took.

951
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,800
She could have turned you in at any minute...

952
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,000
...or did you tell your boy to shoot her
at the first sign of trouble?

953
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,200
You had your chance.
You followed me instead of her.

954
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,100
Where the fuck you going?

955
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,300
Where were you supposed to meet
when something went wrong?

956
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,800
There was no plan.

957
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,700
Bullshit! The girl didn't look too good tonight.

958
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,500
From what I could tell she could barely walk.

959
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,200
What are they going to do to her once she
slows them down? Huh?

960
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,200
They won't hurt her.

961
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,000
Then they'll probably get themselves killed.

962
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,500
How many will that make it, Anna?

963
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,300
Hey, you can play the heartbroken
revolutionary all you want when I'm not around.

964
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,000
The truth is you used everybody...

965
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,600
...your friends, your husband,

966
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,700
the girl, and for what?

967
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,500
Tanaka's still here and your father's still dead.

968
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,000
You want to bring him down?

969
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,500
Tell me where she is!

970
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,400
You think that's all this is about?

971
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,300
Thousands of people are dying every day.

972
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,000
You think one life makes a difference?

973
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,900
She can hardly speak.

974
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,900
All she ever asks for is her opium pipe.

975
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,100
I just need to find out...

976
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,600
...who killed my friend.

977
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,900
Anthony, it's me.

978
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,100
Have you gone to bed yet?

979
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,100
Don't wait up for me.

980
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,400
I'll be home late.

981
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,400
Me too.

982
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,700
I miss you too.

983
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,900
Who is it?

984
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,500
Yes?

985
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,900
Captain Tanaka would like to see you.

986
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,800
Has something happened? It's past midnight.

987
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,400
He apologizes.

988
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,800
All right, let's make it quick... Hey, hold it!

989
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,100
Wait here, Mr. Soames.

990
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,800
I hope you know you're in violation of
International Settlement laws.

991
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,100
You got no jurisdiction...

992
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,800
Where is she...

993
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,500
...Mr. Soames?

994
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,500
I don't know.

995
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,500
I have no idea.

996
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,900
Mrs. Lan-Ting never asked you for any help?

997
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,400
Introductions? Passports?

998
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,700
I'm sure if she had wanted any of those things,

999
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,800
she'd have gone to you, sir, or her husband.

1000
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,900
There's no point in waiting. Proceed.

1001
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,400
I'm sorry about these interruptions.

1002
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,300
It's an unfortunate business.

1003
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,000
We arrested a spy last night.

1004
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,400
We arrested him on a train leaving the city.

1005
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,000
His lover turned him in.

1006
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,200
She was a spy, Mr. Soames.

1007
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,400
You would admire her skills.

1008
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,100
We did everything we could to break him down.

1009
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,100
Even when we put him face to face with the girl

1010
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,900
and she told him what she'd done...

1011
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,000
...he refused to believe it.

1012
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,300
It's amazing how a man holds onto an idea...

1013
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,900
...even when that idea is so obviously false.

1014
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,300
I suppose it's all we have to keep us going.

1015
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,600
You're sure Mrs.
Lan-Ting didn't tell you anything?

1016
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,300
I'm sure.

1017
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,800
I warn you...

1018
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,300
...it isn't easy to watch.

1019
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,600
We'll send an official
complaint to their government.

1020
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,300
Where are we going?

1021
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,400
To the hotel.

1022
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,100
We have to pack your things.

1023
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,000
There's a ship leaving Shanghai at 8:00.

1024
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,400
The girl's still alive.
I've seen her with my own eyes,

1025
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,800
I can find her.

1026
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,900
It's too late. Even if she's still alive

1027
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,300
there's nothing that you can do now.

1028
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Your cover is blown. Tanaka won't give you
a second chance.

1029
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,000
I don't want a second chance.
I want 24 more hours.

1030
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,800
Please don't make this harder.

1031
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,100
Just get the hell out of Shanghai.

1032
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,600
You sure I can't change your mind?

1033
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,600
Not this time.

1034
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,500
You finally got sick of me, huh?

1035
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,800
No, are you kidding me?

1036
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,000
I just can't keep up with you.

1037
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,700
That's because you're
always watching my back.

1038
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,300
You know as soon as I get there,

1039
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,700
I'm gonna cause such a stir that they're gonna
have to transfer you...

1040
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,300
Christmas in Shanghai,

1041
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,100
old man. I'm holding you to that.

1042
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,000
I'll get the key.

1043
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,700
Hello?

1044
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,700
My car's parked in front of the hotel.

1045
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,700
Well, could you send it up? I'm in a hurry

1046
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,700
Thank you.

1047
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,800
An unpaid bar bill.

1048
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,400
Is there any other kind?

1049
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,100
Can I give you a hand with any of this?

1050
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,300
Paul?

1051
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,100
It's alright.

1052
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,600
How is she?

1053
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,300
Not good.

1054
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,500
Where's Chen?

1055
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,000
I sent him to buy more opium.

1056
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,000
She's getting worse.
I didn't know what else to do.

1057
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,700
We need to get her to a hospital right now
or she's gonna die.

1058
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,800
Get the car.

1059
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,000
I need you to wake up.

1060
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,400
I need you to talk to me, okay? - Okay.

1061
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,400
Conner?

1062
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,300
I was so scared.

1063
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,100
Why were you scared?

1064
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,600
Tell me why you were scared.

1065
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,600
They were waiting for us.

1066
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,400
Anthony.

1067
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,500
I had no choice.

1068
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,800
It was the only way to save you.

1069
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,300
Your life in return for hers.

1070
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,200
Sumi!

1071
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,400
Sumi! What happened, Sumi?

1072
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,600
There's an American hospital about a mile away.

1073
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,100
We might be able to save her.

1074
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,200
There won't be anyone left in your hospital
by the time we get there.

1075
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,700
Japan has just declared
war on the United States.

1076
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,500
Our first fleet bombed Pearl Harbour an hour ago.

1077
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,300
The invasion of Shanghai is already underway.

1078
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,900
There's nothing we can do for her.

1079
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,900
We can only ease her pain.

1080
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,300
I can't do this alone.

1081
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:47,600
Please.

1082
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,700
Sumi.

1083
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,400
Sumi. It's me.

1084
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,900
What did you think she'd tell you?

1085
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,400
Why you killed my friend.

1086
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,600
She betrayed you.

1087
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:26,300
That's how he found out about your plans.

1088
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,300
I had the proof. He took pictures.

1089
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,000
You met with the officers of the Kaga.

1090
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,600
I heard about the plan to attack Pearl Harbour
through my informants.

1091
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,800
I was never a part of it.

1092
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,400
Yes, I killed your friend.

1093
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,800
I didn't even know he was a spy
when I followed her that night.

1094
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I shot him in the dark.

1095
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,800
He could...

1096
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:02,900
...have been anyone.

1097
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
You won't suffer now.

1098
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,800
Mr. Lan-Ting.

1099
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,600
I need to ask your wife some questions.

1100
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,200
Ask them at my house.

1101
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,200
It's a military matter.

1102
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,900
We had a deal.

1103
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,700
Our deal was she wouldn't be harmed.

1104
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,600
This isn't just business.

1105
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,100
We're talking about my wife.

1106
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,700
I don't have time to argue.

1107
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,500
She isn't going anywhere with you.

1108
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,000
She'll be returned safely.

1109
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,600
I'll be back.

1110
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,100
Don't worry.

1111
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,200
Please.

1112
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Captain!

1113
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,200
Wait.

1114
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,300
Anthony.

1115
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,400
Paul...

1116
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,400
...please.

1117
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,200
We have to leave.

1118
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,100
This is Radio Shanghai.

1119
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,300
The United States of America is at war...

1120
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,600
Paul, I need your help to get her out of here.

1121
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,300
Passports!

1122
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,400
I'm driving for him.

1123
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,300
Passports!

1124
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,800
Go to hell!

1125
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,200
Darling,

1126
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,800
Darling, I'm sorry.

1127
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,900
What did you say?

1128
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,100
I can't hear you.

1129
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,400
I'm sorry Anthony.

1130
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,500
I can't protect you anymore.
You must leave Shanghai.

1131
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,400
Promise me.

1132
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:48,800
Please, get her out of Shanghai.

1133
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,700
No matter what happens stay close to me.
When we get to the port

1134
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,900
they'll only evacuate Europeans and Americans.

1135
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Come on! Anna.

1136
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,500
Come on, Anna,

1137
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,100
we gotta get to the port!

1138
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,700
Stay close!

1139
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:49,000
Hold on to my arm!

1140
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,200
Anna!

1141
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:51,600
Anna!

1142
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,000
Anna!

1143
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,300
Hold on to my arm! Anna! Come on!

1144
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,900
The port is now under... Please stay calm, sir.

1145
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,700
The port is now under the control
of the Japanese Army.

1146
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,900
Foreign nationals will still be allowed to leave.

1147
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,700
We left the house when we
heard the first explosion.

1148
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,600
I was sure I had the passports with me.

1149
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,700
Well, I can issue you temporary passes

1150
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,200
I just have to ask you a few questions

1151
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,600
to satisfy the Japanese authorities.

1152
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,800
So, what were you doing in China?

1153
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,600
I came to help a friend with his business.

1154
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,900
The business went bust,
but fortunately I met my wife.

1155
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,200
I guess you start looking for something...

1156
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,100
...and end up finding something else.

1157
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:00,800
And where do you plan to move after
you leave China, Mrs. Fitzpatrick?

1158
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,400
We haven't had much time to think about it.

1159
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,700
Your country is at war.

1160
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,600
Your people are fighting for their lives.

1161
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,900
Why are you leaving?

1162
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,000
I'm going with my husband.

1163
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,900
One day I will return.

1164
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,300
We have to get out of this line.

1165
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,500
He still hasn't seen us.

1166
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,600
My wife's very ill.
We have to get out of this line, please.

1167
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,600
Please, my wife is very sick. I have to get her
out of this line.

1168
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,500
She's very sick, please.

1169
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,200
When he sees me I want you to keep walking.

1170
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,200
No, no

1171
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,500
Anna, Anna, please.

1172
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,500
No.

1173
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,400
The world had changed.

1174
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,200
...and it would never be the same.

1175
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:33,800
In Europe and in Asia the cities were burning...

1176
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,900
...and the hunters came out at night.

1177
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,900
Anna got off the boat in Macao.

1178
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,400
I knew she'd go back to Shanghai.

1179
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,800
She worked with the resistance.

1180
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,200
Somehow she stayed alive.

1181
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,900
Maybe luck, maybe courage.

1182
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,700
You had to have both.

1183
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,700
I know because I did the same thing

1184
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,400
in other cities under different names.

1185
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,800
Until the long night ended.

1186
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,600
But Shanghai haunted me...

1187
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,700
...so I returned...

1188
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,700
...to her.
