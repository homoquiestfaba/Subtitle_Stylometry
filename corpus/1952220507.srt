1
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,071
Is Mr. Tendo safe?

2
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,479
Yes.

3
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,117
Where is the man who saved me?

4
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,399
He refuses to answer.

5
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,832
Anything to say to me?

6
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,238
I had nothing to do with it.

7
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,912
We know you betrayed us.

8
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,308
No. Not me.

9
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,759
We know that you're lying to us.

10
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,272
You're working for Campanela.

11
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,075
I swear...

12
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,515
I'm not working for Campanela!

13
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,238
This is your last chance.

14
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,109
Just tell me the truth!

15
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,148
You're making a mistake.

16
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,797
You're very brave.

17
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,435
I regret having to
put you through this.

18
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,755
I regret it also.

19
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,315
Some hero...

20
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,039
He smells like a cheeseburger.

21
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,793
I will be assassinated.

22
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,997
We've taken every precaution.

23
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,071
Still, it will happen.

24
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,352
I will put Kazuo by your side.

25
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,029
But Campanela has the advantage.

26
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,429
This was their territory.

27
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,913
The desire to protect it
will drive them harder.

28
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,798
We will only survive
if we make no mistakes.

29
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,157
Then we will make no mistakes.

30
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,917
What about this new man?

31
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,798
Is he loyal?

32
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,515
Yes.

33
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,798
But he is an outsider.

34
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,431
We are all outsiders here.

35
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,517
Yuko seems to like Nick.

36
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,518
There is much to like about him.

37
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,071
Can you understand me?

38
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,875
No...?

39
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,393
I could never tell you this...

40
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,036
But even in this short time...

41
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,513
I know in my heart...

42
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,193
That I could spend
the rest of my life with you.

43
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,874
I will not let you kill yourself!

44
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,871
Yes, I speak Japanese.

45
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,511
The FBl demands
a lot from its agents.

46
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,479
Get down!
