1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,759


2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,159


3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,279


4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,319


5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,879


6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,439


7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,239


8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,839


9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,359


10
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,039
"Lot for sale'"

11
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,039
We have evidence
that your husband

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,119
entered Dai Thanh floating farm,

13
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,999
to try to steal something.

14
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,759
Following a confrontation,
he jumped into the water.

15
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,759
He drowned, obviously.

16
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,959
Those who discovered
your husband's corpse

17
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,359
noticed this broken
necklace in his hand.

18
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,079
We have many witnesses.

19
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,999
Wait for me there ! 
I'm going to call them !

20
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,999
"Sao and Thi"

21
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,839
Wonderful !

22
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,719
A true blessing
from our ancestors !

23
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,279
My mom sends us
this fish from Lim Kim !

24
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,079
Oh my God ! 
Here's another one !

25
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,879
You see ?
Here is the small and the small...

26
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,079
You're gonna make them and eat
them like your mom told you, huh?

27
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,319
Are you still mad at my mom?

28
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,439
I'm going to look for cilantro

29
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,319
to prepare it properly !

30
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,279
Where ?

31
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,399
Nobody has any more.

32
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,959
It's time to sell it all.

33
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,599
Wait a few more days !

34
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,879
The leaves should
be greener than that.

35
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,919
Do you remember what the
grasshoppers did to it last year?

36
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,999
If they dare, I will
eat them in my turn !

37
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,359
We will have what we want.

38
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,799
Leave it to me !

39
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,999
Wash yourself !
We're going to sit down to eat.

40
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,319
This is our last can.

41
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,239
I dare you to jump in.

42
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,319
You are sure of it ?

43
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,079
Go on ! 
We need it to make coffee tomorrow !

44
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,439
What if I got sick
from not washing?

45
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,599
Wash yourself properly !

46
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,559
Turn around, so I can
caress you properly...

47
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,959
No shower today?

48
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,839
Where would I get the water?

49
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,559
I did it right, today...

50
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,679
Did you like it ?

51
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,039
No.

52
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,079
And I never want
you to do it again.

53
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,999
Yet you had always
told me that you liked it !

54
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,279
That was a long time ago.

55
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,319
I didn't dare tell you before.

56
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,519
Maybe it's because of 
the way we do it

57
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,799
that we never get a child.

58
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,279
I've been waiting for two years already.

59
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,239
But still no child.

60
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,879
And each time, it hurts
me more and more.

61
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,260
1...

62
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,620
2...

63
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,119
3...

64
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
4... 5...

65
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,599
Darling !

66
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,519
Shit !

67
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,079
It must have happened
yesterday, just before the rain.

68
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,959
It is surely the work
of grasshoppers !

69
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,959
Sure.

70
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,479
While you were busy
caressing me, right?

71
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,719
Are they still
good, do you think?

72
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,799
Don't worry.

73
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,799
I will plant melons
for New Year's Day.

74
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,479
Where are my parents' urns?

75
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,159
There, in a plastic bag.

76
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,759
- You did it right, huh?
- Quick !

77
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,199
Catch this !

78
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,919
It will weigh too much !
The boat is going to sink !

79
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,559
Take this ! That way
we can eat properly.

80
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,039
“Private Property
Access Prohibited”

81
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,599
Who allowed you
to fish here, morons?

82
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,079
Can't you read, or what?

83
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,559
At one time, it may 
have belonged to you.

84
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,479
Now the water
belongs to everyone.

85
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,319
Get off my property now !

86
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,599
The more time passes,
the less fish there are.

87
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,639
There is no more land,

88
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,839
people are all
fishing to survive.

89
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,279
Shit !

90
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,319
He must have gotten stuck in the net.

91
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,039
He was eaten alive.

92
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,279
There is also a
huge hole in the net.

93
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,999
Something must have eaten
those fish and then escaped.

94
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,879
Sell ​​the land...

95
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,399
and leave.

96
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,799
Who would buy this?

97
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,559
The big companies are
looking for land to build farms on.

98
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,959
This land has been passed
down for generations.

99
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,839
Mom just passed away.

100
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,759
It would be a
sin to sell it now.

101
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,359
What is happening ?

102
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,879
A huge goldfish
swooped down on me...

103
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,559
and devoured my stomach !

104
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,959
Unbelievable !

105
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,839
You don't have to believe me !

106
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,199
If you ever bury me here,

107
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,639
build my coffin carefully.

108
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,399
"Lot for sale'"

109
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,719
What ?

110
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,199
Really ?

111
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,839
Right away ?

112
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,879
Are you sure?

113
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,839
OK.

114
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,119
Where are you going ?

115
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,999
A madman wants to buy our land.

116
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,279
He wants to see me right away.

117
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,439
At two o'clock in the morning...

118
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,679
Just tell him the price.

119
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,279
Do not sign any documents.

120
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,519
Yes I know...

121
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,279
Darling...

122
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,919
What ?

123
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,879
Collect some rice and oil.

124
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,759
We do not have any more.

125
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,159
OK.

126
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,039
So, what about this land ?

127
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,039
How did you get this money?

128
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,279
I...

129
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,839
Is it a down payment?

130
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,639
Yes, but not for the land.

131
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,079
For what, then?

132
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,759
It's a down payment for a job.

133
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,519
What work ?

134
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,679
Not far from here.
They will let me know.

135
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,759
Crocodiles go on land !

136
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,399
And people go into the sea !

137
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,439
Crocodiles go on land !

138
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,719
Crocodiles go on land !

139
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,119
And people go into the sea !

140
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,519
And people go into the sea !

141
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,519
You are very careful !

142
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,119
No, it was Thi who asked me.

143
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,719
He was afraid of
being eaten by the fish.

144
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,279
Why not cremate him instead?

145
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,599
He wanted to be buried in his land.

146
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,719
Please screw the lid on !

147
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,879
Did you buy enough screws?

148
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,119
Otherwise, use ones from your boat !

149
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,039
I could stop fishing

150
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,999
and come live with you.

151
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,879
And then you would
take care of me. OK ?

152
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,919
Hey, Sao !

153
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,399
What a good smell of pandan...

154
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,239
Here ! You will pay me
when you have money.

155
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,119
Where have you been ?

156
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,439
The neighbors were worried.

157
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,359
Where did you find
pandan this season ?

158
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,719
Guys gave it to me.

159
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,359
They might have stolen it...

160
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,839
Don't tell anyone.

161
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,479
They told me that when they

162
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,439
approached Dai
Thannh floating farm,

163
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,479
they heard people fighting,

164
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,519
and someone screamed for help.

165
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,119
Someone yelled :
"Head under water !"

166
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,279
And another: 'To hell with it !'

167
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,279
It's all fucked up these days !

168
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,719
There is no more land.
What do we have left on this Earth ?

169
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,159
Please give me
two cans of water !

170
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,319
There is none left.

171
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,799
Do you know what time it is ?

172
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,359
You didn't wake up ?

173
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,319
Usually this is my  husband's job.

174
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,559
He hung around all night and
he didn't come home. That's it ?

175
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,079
Well, if you need
water, go to Dai Thannh.

176
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,119
You will be asked
for an arm and a leg...

177
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,159
Please give me some !

178
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,839
A can will suffice.

179
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,639
If you want more,
call me tonight !

180
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,959
It's free !

181
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,279
Thanh, my brother !

182
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,519
I took you for Thi.

183
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,799
Did you cremate him ?

184
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,519
He's over there right now.

185
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,559
I'm going to go visit him.

186
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,799
OK. 
Then we'll eat something.

187
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,719
In this fish dish...

188
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,319
You have to add onions
for it to taste right.

189
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,519
Like brothers...

190
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,479
For Thi, everything
had to be done right.

191
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,239
We had fun together
from morning to night.

192
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,199
We even shared clothes.

193
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,519
When Thi was getting dressed,
he woud talk about you every time.

194
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,799
But why did you leave
without telling anyone ?

195
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,879
Thi was very sad.

196
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,879
You were there for him,
he didn't need me anymore.

197
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,079
I had bought this for him, for New
Year's Day, but didn't have a chance...

198
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,439
Last year, you gave him
shoes he never put on.

199
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,559
He wanted an outfit
that went together.

200
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,919
You can put them on now.

201
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,559
No, I don't need those things.

202
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,319
I'll wait for the tide to drop...

203
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,119
and put them in his coffin.

204
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,119
Come inside !
Otherwise you will get sick.

205
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,999
Stop it ! 
I am not a sissy !

206
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,999
Thi left a bottle of alcohol.

207
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,039
You should drink
some to warm up.

208
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,599
Did you discover anything else ?

209
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,999
What more do you want ?

210
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,519
The truth about my husband's death !

211
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,159
What other truth ?

212
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,639
Let's go home !

213
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,959
Go on !

214
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,479
He had started working at night.

215
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,239
But he didn't tell me for whom.

216
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,559
A few days later,
they killed him.

217
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,119
Had he brought a
small tube home ?

218
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,239
What kind of tube ?

219
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,719
A tube ?

220
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,159
How do you 
know about it ?

221
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,359
Someone told me they
would give me pain medicine.

222
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,679
Now I remember...

223
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,479
I'm taking you home.
Then you will take...

224
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,999
something at the market for Thi.

225
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,799
Hey, Sao !

226
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,639
Sao !

227
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,039
Did you hear something ?

228
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,639
I do not know !

229
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,039
How do you know it
was my brother-in-law ?

230
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,679
Do you have proof ?
I want to see him !

231
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,799
Calm down ! 
We are in no rush !

232
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,799
Asshole !
I should have ripped his head off !

233
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,759
Hey ! We don't swear here !

234
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,479
Rip off whose head ?

235
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,839
To that bastard Giang !

236
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,559
This bastard kills
people, without scruples !

237
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,719
Shut up !

238
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,279
If we had arrived later, he

239
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,799
would have ripped your head off !

240
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,519
Please stop !

241
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,399
Could I talk to him for a moment ?

242
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,359
Just a moment.

243
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,839
Then I'll take him to the
provincial police station.

244
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,199
Why did you leave
without saying a word ?

245
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,319
What's the point ? You would have
ended up worrying unnecessarily.

246
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,039
Too late now.

247
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,479
Come home.

248
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,879
There's nothing you can do here.

249
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,199
They got me like a greased pig.

250
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,479
Who is this Giang you were talking about ?

251
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,959
This floating farm boss
thug in Dai Thanh...

252
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,679
He married the boss's
daughter to get this job.

253
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,039
He is as cruel as
a cursed crocodile !

254
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,079
He ordered his gang
to beat up Thi

255
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,399
and throw him in the water !

256
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,079
Have you already forgotten ?

257
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,919
Giang left Saigon

258
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,319
to come and look 
for species of seaweed.

259
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,439
You remember it ?

260
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,159
This type of vagabond
invents stories !

261
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,199
Don't believe him !

262
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,519
The sea level continues to rise. 
Southern Vietnam is a territory

263
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,639
that stands to lose the
best arable land in the world...

264
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,879
Are you looking for a job ?

265
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,199
Step back !

266
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,319
- Look towards the camera !

267
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,839
Look straight ahead !

268
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,519
You're the thief's
wife, aren't you ?

269
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,079
Your brother-in-law also killed people here.

270
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,959
What do you want ?

271
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,039
I just want to apply for a job.

272
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,119
Did you take us for crazy ?
Go home !

273
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,119
Could I at least
talk to the manager ?

274
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,479
Tell him my name is Sao. I'm
the one who sold coffee near here.

275
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,319
I told you to go home !

276
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,559
Watch out, or I'll
deal with you too !

277
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,919
Are you looking for a job ?

278
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,159
Did you really want
my husband dead ?

279
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,479
But what do you want, exactly ?

280
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,359
I want you to deny everything...

281
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,399
so I can go home...

282
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,239
and console me, knowing
that I have discovered the truth.

283
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,479
The boss will pay you
500,000 dong a week,

284
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,719
We will pick you up
every Monday at 7 a.m.

285
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,399
You will have the right to take two
changes of clothes, nothing else.

286
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,399
And above all, no
phones and no weapons.

287
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,999
Otherwise, you'll
be fired immediately.

288
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,559
"Sao and Giang 10 years ago"

289
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,279
Oh my God ! You want to
demolish my house, or what ?!

290
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,359
Excuse me ! I am really sorry !

291
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,519
I am a student of the
University of the Littoral.

292
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,759
I am here for research
on plants in this area.

293
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,279
Can I ask you a favor ?

294
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,879
What's that ?

295
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,919
I will stay here for a few months.

296
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,599
I rented a house
on stilts there.

297
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,839
I saw smoke coming
from your house.

298
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,039
It smelled so good, and...

299
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,639
The smell of braised
fish is so good...

300
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,719
I wish someone
would give me some...

301
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,679
You just had to
tell me right away !

302
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,359
It's fish soup.

303
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,239
Not braised fish.

304
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,559
Ah, OK...

305
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,079
Are you from Saigon ?

306
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,040
Yes !

307
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,159
I don't really know
your eating habits.

308
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,879
I eat everything !

309
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,999
I just prefer it to be
a little more cooked.

310
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,359
You should look elsewhere.

311
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,799
There are stalls near the market.

312
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,799
Saigon tourists love it.

313
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,439
Mrs !

314
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,319
Excuse me !

315
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,759
Hey !

316
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,199
Is someone there ?

317
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,919
Who are you looking for ?

318
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,919
I'm looking for the waitress.

319
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,039
She left.

320
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,359
I work in his place, at night.

321
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,519
What would you like ?

322
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,759
I had ordered a black coffee...

323
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,679
but she put sugar in it.

324
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,359
Force of habit...

325
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,319
I can bring you another.

326
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,159
We roast the coffee ourselves here.

327
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,199
It is therefore very strong and bitter.

328
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,559
A little sugar
improves the taste.

329
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,759
Just a little bit.
Want to taste ?

330
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,599
You were right !

331
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,359
With a little sugar, it
definitely tastes better.

332
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,559
You pretend to be nice...

333
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,479
Why should I pretend ?

334
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,639
You just want to take advantage
of my mom cooking for you.

335
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,039
That's why you pretend.

336
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,959
How do you know I'm looking
for someone who cooks ?

337
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,239
Mom told me.

338
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,039
And how do you know it's me ?

339
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,599
You're the only one who looks
like a student from Saigon here.

340
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,479
In the age of the Internet, are

341
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,399
there still people
who read books ?

342
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,639
In all sincerity,

343
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,319
I haven't touched a
book for over 10 years.

344
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,999
I knew it.

345
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,159
What did you know ?

346
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,079
And what do you
do to relax a bit ?

347
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,559
I watch TV or stream movies.

348
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,919
What a drag !

349
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,799
TV and movies
make people lazy and

350
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,479
forget the pleasure
of reading a book.

351
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,199
Try to start reading
again, you'll see...

352
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,559
how different it is
from your bright screen.

353
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,439
Last year, I had read a
poem online, by chance.

354
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,679
And I felt no emotion.

355
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,719
Then I read the same
poem, but on paper.

356
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,759
And that really moved me.

357
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,159
Now I no longer have any doubts.

358
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,999
You always firmly believe
in your own opinions.

359
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,199
It's easy to believe
in your own ideas.

360
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,719
Convincing others
is much more difficult.

361
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,159
You have convinced me !

362
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,799
Advise me a book, then ! OK ?

363
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,959
Of what genre ?

364
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,439
Poetry, prose ?
Story, fiction ?

365
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,959
I'm too lazy to
read a long story.

366
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,799
Give me your favorite
short story book.

367
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,199
News ?

368
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,399
News...

369
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,359
What was the title ?

370
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,879
"2020" ?

371
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,399
A brief speculative
narrative about the future.

372
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,279
We are in 2020...

373
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,559
Where would this
speculative narrative be ?

374
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,679
Yes, but the author wrote
this book 20 years ago.

375
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,359
He recounts life today.

376
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,319
And you ?

377
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,319
What would you write about the future ?

378
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,159
Me ?

379
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,919
I would write...

380
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,559
“The sea level will rise,
and submerge this cafe...

381
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,039
"and this shelf too !"

382
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,759
And then all your books
will float in the water...

383
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,319
So even the fish will be
able to read my books !

384
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,359
Just like archaeologists who
would study lost civilizations.

385
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,079
Hey, Sao !

386
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,399
We are dying of thirst here !

387
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,319
Please, two iced coffees !

388
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,719
You'll talk about
science fiction later !

389
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,519
OK, I'll be right there !

390
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,999
When did you arrive ?

391
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,359
What's wrong ?

392
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,879
I do not know.

393
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,279
Can you help me please ?

394
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,359
Could you take me there, please ?

395
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,599
I know where you live.

396
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,599
This boat will have to be repaired.

397
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,839
I just arrived.
How do you know ?

398
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,079
Giang, right ?

399
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,639
How do you know ?

400
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,999
It was Sao who told me.

401
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,599
You know Sao ?

402
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,199
We grew up together. Then one
day, she left to study in Saigon.

403
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,159
And where did
she study, exactly ?

404
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,799
At the university, I believe.
I do not know.

405
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,679
Her father died
during this time.

406
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,839
She came back to live here
with her mother last year.

407
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,959
She looks fit...

408
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,479
Sao likes her a lot, doesn't she ?

409
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,919
She's not doing very well these days.

410
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,759
She is famous for
preparing very special dishes.

411
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,759
Everyone here wants
to be her son-in-law.

412
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,239
But it's not that easy...

413
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,039
They would like to be
just to eat well. Not true ?

414
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,839
One marries for questions
of interest or money.

415
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,879
I would marry for food !

416
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,919
OK, let's go.

417
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,919
Thanks.

418
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,999
Here is the money. Thanks !

419
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,839
It's too much. I'm just
taking the gas money.

420
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,519
I have to go fishing early tomorrow.

421
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,439
Thanh will lead you to your boat.

422
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,719
Thanh ?

423
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,039
My little brother.

424
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,079
Thanks a lot !

425
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,759
How would I have
got along without you ?

426
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,039
OK, I have to go there.

427
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,079
Someone there ?

428
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,439
Someone there ?

429
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,799
My mother made stuffed calamari.

430
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,839
I brought you some.

431
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,839
Thank you very much
to you and your mom.

432
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,399
I have heard that...

433
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,599
many would like to taste your
mother's dishes, but without success...

434
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,639
Don't trust Thi !

435
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,719
Why haven't you come
to the cafe these days ?

436
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,519
I was very busy.

437
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,879
My darling !

438
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,519
Don't worry. I already
found a place to eat.

439
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,199
Delicious and very clean.

440
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,879
I have already listed
some types of algae.

441
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,399
I'll take them back
to Saigon for analysis.

442
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,639
I have nothing else to do here...

443
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,999
I can fully concentrate
on my work.

444
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,359
Do not worry. Everything is fine.

445
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,439
When will you leave ?

446
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,159
I need this bowl...

447
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,279
to be able to serve
you on your plate.

448
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,639
Do you know where this dish comes from ?

449
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,359
No, but I like this pattern.
It is very simple.

450
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,679
I'm no antiques expert...

451
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,479
but I think you are right !

452
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,479
You can keep it.

453
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,359
No, I cannot accept...

454
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,359
You can put your coffee in it.

455
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,039
It could attract a lot of customers.

456
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,039
You were attracted.
That's already something.

457
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,999
Why do you collect seaweed ?

458
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,319
Algae ?

459
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,079
I'm trying to figure out how...

460
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,319
they can survive in seawater,
since it is salty.

461
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,239
You know there is seaweed...

462
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,359
that lives in both
fresh and salt water ?

463
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,759
It exists ?

464
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,759
Where ?

465
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,959
Wait...

466
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,119
It was a long time ago...

467
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,999
I believe...

468
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,319
But first I want to know
why you collect seaweed...

469
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,359
No, you tell me first
where this type of algae is.

470
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,359
Then I will tell you about my work.

471
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,519
I just told you
half of my secret.

472
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,079
Your turn now.

473
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,679
Besides, you know
everything about me and my

474
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,279
family, whereas I don't
know anything about you.

475
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,799
But don't tell anyone !

476
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,799
I'm researching the genes
of plants living in salt water.

477
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,719
I'm trying to figure out how much...

478
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,079
they differ from those
that live in fresh water.

479
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,079
That's all ?

480
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,519
I thought there was a secret, or something.
- Nope...

481
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,839
In this case,
you're so confident

482
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,599
that you might make a mistake.

483
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,119
You don't know the
potential of this research.

484
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,519
It is something
concrete, I assure you.

485
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,519
Ok, I leave you to your dreams...

486
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,439
I have to go back there.

487
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,919
Wait !

488
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,279
And the other half of the secret ?

489
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,719
You haven't told me where these algae are.
- At the estuary.

490
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,959
Where the river flows into the ocean.
- Could you help me find them ?

491
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,879
Will you pay me ?

492
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,479
No, just a small
gift, in friendship.

493
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,519
When will you be free ?

494
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,359
Tomorrow ?

495
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,999
We'll see...

496
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,319
Do you want to bring
new technologies to us ?

497
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,639
What technology ?

498
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,559
I'm only researching
estuary plants.

499
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,439
Who told you that ?

500
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,159
Since the Xoai Rap
River is polluted, people

501
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,119
are wary of big
companies and scientists.

502
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,039
I do not know why...

503
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,679
Thi is so nice to you...

504
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,039
Not all companies are dangerous.

505
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,159
Many of them help
to make things better.

506
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,039
As for me, I have
absolutely no intention of

507
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,279
contributing to the
destruction of the environment.

508
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,159
Are you sure ?

509
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,399
If you cause
damage in this area,

510
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,199
I assure you
that I will find you.

511
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,839
- Is that a threat ?

512
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,079
Not yet.

513
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,119
One last thing...

514
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,919
Thi adores Sao. Do no damage.

515
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,639
It's here. Get me down !

516
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,239
...but tonight I want
you to stay with me...

517
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,119
This evening ? In fact, I
still have a few things to do.

518
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,799
I have to go back
to Can Gio tomorrow.

519
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,519
You have just returned to Saigon,
and you already have to leave ?

520
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,359
Don't forget your
date with my father

521
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,319
and the Dai Thanh
Board of Directors.

522
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,999
“From a Portuguese ship
that sank 200 years ago.

523
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,159
"I miss you."

524
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,839
At present, the goal
of our company is to

525
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,959
minimize the effective
need for fresh water.

526
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,919
Our priority is
mainly vegetables.

527
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,679
Using the results of
your initial research,

528
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,599
we would like to know...

529
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,079
if there is any chance
to solve this problem.

530
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,159
In order to answer the
question of our director,

531
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,439
I would like to summarize
the results of my research.

532
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,279
I have indeed discovered a type of algae

533
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,199
having developed in fresh
water, but having migrated

534
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,399
to the estuary to adapt
to the new situation.

535
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,399
These algae have mutated genes

536
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,559
in order to survive
in salt water.

537
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,399
But what's more,

538
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,399
I managed to identify
all the mutated genes.

539
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,359
However,

540
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,439
it is a natural process...

541
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,559
extremely long.

542
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,599
In addition...

543
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,159
"Extremely long" ?
That's to say ?

544
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,399
I can't tell you
exactly, but at least

545
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,399
a few decades, maybe even more.

546
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,319
Nevertheless,

547
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,879
the latest breakthroughs
in genetic engineering

548
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,959
allow us to speed up this
process in the laboratory...

549
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:07,159
by inserting the mutated genes
of this algae into other plants,

550
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,479
which would allow them
to survive in salt water.

551
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,399
Would this imply a
change in color, smell...

552
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,079
texture... of the vegetables themselves ?

553
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,279
I want to reassure you...
This would not happen...

554
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,279
because we would only
modify the genes allowing

555
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,759
the plant to eliminate
the salt in the water.

556
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,879
In other words, the features...

557
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,479
of the plant would remain intact.

558
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,919
In addition,

559
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,679
if successful,

560
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,559
the next step would be to grow
these vegetables directly in seawater

561
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,479
while avoiding the
construction of floating farms.

562
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,919
We're just getting
started, and you're

563
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,119
already dreaming
of a second step !

564
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,079
I believe that the first step
is to establish a partnership

565
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,919
with an advanced genetic
engineering laboratory.

566
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,879
I suggest that Mr. Giang
find the best university in

567
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,639
this field, in order to start
a profitable collaboration.

568
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,879
My dear !

569
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,599
Do you know what I'm thinking ?

570
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,679
I imagine that one fine
day the water will completely

571
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,799
recede, the bottom of the
ocean will be just a sandy beach,

572
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,959
and that I will run with you, until
we are completely exhausted.

573
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,799
Sao, listen.

574
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,959
I have something to tell you.

575
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,959
I have good news.

576
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,119
I have just received a scholarship
to continue my research.

577
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,399
At a university in the USA.

578
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,239
When will you leave ?

579
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,319
In two days.

580
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,239
I'm going to have to go
back to Saigon tonight.

581
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,319
So I won't be able to come
back here very often... For a while.

582
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,319
Sao ! What are you doing ?

583
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,319
Come back here ! Right away !

584
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,399
Sao !

585
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,399
Marry me !

586
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,879
Thi !

587
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,079
You scared me !

588
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,239
The bus will be leaving soon.

589
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,359
Get on, I'll take you !
You will arrive in time !

590
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,519
I came here by motorbike.

591
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,039
It's too nice of you...

592
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,959
We didn't get to
know each other well,

593
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,999
but you've always
been very kind to me.

594
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,599
Yes, but you know...
I think of myself first.

595
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,639
I do not understand
what you mean...

596
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,599
Before Sao's mother died a few

597
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,079
months ago, she
wanted Sao to marry me.

598
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,399
But Sao never stopped hoping for a
moment that you would come back.

599
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,239
Where did you find that ?

600
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,359
Her husband was killed here...

601
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,319
Besides, she works here !
No shame !

602
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,599
Apparently, she loves
to have fun, the naughty...

603
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,559
Even with the director's
husband, it seems...

604
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,319
It doesn't surprise me, by the way...

605
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,359
What a slut !

606
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,639
This fish is perfect
for fish soup.

607
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,679
Fish soup ?

608
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,279
With soy sauce, delicious.

609
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,879
Is she new ?

610
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,199
Since the day before yesterday.
Super hard worker.

611
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,919
How could I make it ?

612
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,319
My husband is a picky

613
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,679
eater, but he loves this dish.

614
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,759
Bring him inside, and
open the kitchen door for...

615
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,799
My name is Sao.

616
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,759
... for Sao...

617
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,039
The secret of fish
soup is no secret.

618
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,159
But the fish must be fresh,
and the soy sauce exquisite.

619
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,159
Exquisite soy sauce ?

620
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,359
Pagoda brand.

621
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,119
No sugar, no water
or MSG in the sauce.

622
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,279
Your mother cooked
very well, didn't she ?

623
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,719
When she was still
alive, I didn't like to cook.

624
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,639
There, I regret not
having learned from her.

625
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,479
Then, as my husband
was very demanding, I

626
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,479
had to remember the
tastes of the food I ate.

627
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,079
And I started practicing.

628
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,919
You often eat at
restaurants, don't you ?

629
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,559
I started loving cooking
since I was a mother.

630
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,719
I am so happy to see my
daughter eat what I prepare...

631
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,079
But unlike you, I couldn't
remember my mother's dishes.

632
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,759
Your mother didn't like to cook ?

633
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,799
No, my mother died prematurely.

634
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,999
At my birth.

635
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,439
You didn't have a mother.
Me, I didn't have any children.

636
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,479
What are you doing, Sao ?

637
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,919
Sao !

638
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,999
I know all your secrets !

639
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,719
- What secrets ?
- You watered the vegetables with salt water !

640
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,399
My husband had discovered
it while stealing cilantro !

641
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,879
And you killed him
so no one would know !

642
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,839
Really ? And do you have proof?

643
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,959
Proof ?

644
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,119
The seeds you use !

645
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,799
It's me !

646
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,679
Go on ! Get back to work !

647
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,879
Sorry, sir... Good night !

648
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,479
My body had started to
react in a strange way...

649
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,119
after years of ingesting
these samples.

650
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,279
I contacted a team
of foreign researchers.

651
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,239
They just want to see these
seeds and my cell samples.

652
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,079
And why forbid them ?

653
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,679
As several cases of illness
such as mine had been reported,

654
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,079
Dai Thanh decided
to close this laboratory

655
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,119
and rigorously control my seeds.

656
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,079
They want to use my
discovery to build hundreds

657
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,359
of floating farms
all over the country.

658
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,479
That's why I need these seeds.

659
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,399
It's not just for me,
but for the whole world.

660
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,319
Wow ! As you are human...

661
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,359
Nevertheless, you are indeed

662
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,559
responsible for the
death of my husband !

663
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,079
One second... At the time...

664
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,559
I had entrusted
Thi with this task.

665
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,479
I wanted him to take care of those
seeds. And everything had gone well.

666
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,639
Then, influenced by his brother,

667
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,919
he betrayed me
and tried to steal our

668
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,879
technology for a
competing company.

669
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,359
Thi got screwed.

670
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,559
It was my stepfather

671
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,479
who had decided to throw him in the water !

672
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,799
They are killers...

673
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,039
And now they are no longer 
going to wait for me to die...

674
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,519
and they're keeping an eye on you !

675
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,439
Sooner or later...

676
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,279
they will discover our past...

677
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,759
and my plan with Thi.

678
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,399
I am very worried about your life.

679
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,239
And your life ?

680
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,479
I reflected on my work...

681
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,079
Life or death ?

682
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,799
Either way, this piece
would be perfect as a casket.

683
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,679
Everything you told
me makes perfect sense.

684
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,399
But how do I know
if it's the truth ?

685
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,799
Maximum alert !
A super typhoon is approaching !

686
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,239
Evacuation order
for all employees !

687
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,799
Come, quickly !

688
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,759
Daddy, you're hurting me !

689
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,559
Come with us...

690
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,679
All security guards must
be evacuated immediately !
