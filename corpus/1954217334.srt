1
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,078
Messala.

2
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:04,766
Messala!

3
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,520
Messala.

4
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,918
Messala?

5
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,039
Did I win?

6
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:24,642
No, but you nearly killed yourself trying to.
Come on.

7
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,079
- Is there any other way to race?
- Tell that to my mother.

8
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:35,441
One, two, three!

9
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,483
I should have a line of slaves behind me.

10
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:50,004
And one beside you, whispering in your ear
that you're a man, not a god.

11
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,601
Is that not the Roman way,
Octavius Messala?

12
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:03,245
- What happened to the other cart?
- We went over some rough ground.

13
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:07,322
- They're not racing chariots, you know?
- I told him that.

14
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:10,160
We'll repair it, Mother. I promise.

15
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,003
Where have you two been all day?
Why didn't you take me with you?

16
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,921
Because you are child
and not proper company for young men.

17
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,835
Tickle her severely, Messala.

18
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,565
Judah.

19
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:37,885
A messenger from the Garrison
delivered this. It's for Messala.

20
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,044
We always knew this would come.

21
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:46,518
But it's been five years, more,
since his mother died.

22
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:50,361
Would you prefer his father
had sent for him immediately?

23
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:54,440
- Tirzah will be most unhappy.
- None of us will be happy, Judah.

24
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:57,604
And Simonides has arrived.

25
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,917
You must change your clothes
before you greet him.

26
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,998
Yes, I forgot he was coming.

27
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,885
I'm sorry.
I should have been here to meet him.

28
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,798
Yes.

29
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:10,675
It's time for you
to take up your responsibilities,

30
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,678
and for Messala to face his.

31
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:17,597
Childhood only lasts so long.

32
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:20,918
So our childhoods end on the same day,
his and mine.

33
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,280
And our lives go in different directions.

34
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:30,237
Different directions,
but the same journey to manhood

35
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,198
and all its rewards and responsibilities.

36
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:38,040
And I know that you will meet
whatever lies ahead

37
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:41,483
with a good heart and a brave spirit,

38
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:45,003
for you are your father's son.

39
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,526
And my mother's.

40
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:53,480
No mother was ever more blessed in a child.

41
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,442
Go now, Judah,
and tell your friend playtime's over.

42
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,086
So it would seem.

43
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,680
- What's the secret?
- You just have to be ready.

44
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,756
Who is it from?

45
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:31,999
From my illustrious father,
Senator Marcellus Agrippa.

46
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:34,396
You read it.

47
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:35,715
It's a private letter, Messala.

48
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:39,083
I don't think you'll be embarrassed
by too many intimacies.

49
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:44,486
Remember, the secret is to expect it to fall
every single moment.

50
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:47,315
"To Octavius Messala.

51
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:51,036
"You will leave Jerusalem
with the next military convoy to Caesarea

52
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54,164
"where transportation has been arranged
for your journey to Rome."

53
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:59,959
- Is that all?
- He's a man of few words, Marcellus Agrippa.

54
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,798
I sometimes envy you having a dead father.

55
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:36,046
- Judah, how good to see you.
- Forgive me for not being here to meet you.

56
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:41,042
- It is of no matter. You are well?
- Yes, yes, thank you.

57
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,846
And you? Your journey was not too tiring?

58
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,760
The distance from Antioch
does not grow shorter,

59
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:48,485
and I do not grow younger.

60
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:54,517
Judah, I think that you know
that your father, of blessed memory,

61
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:59,601
hoped that one day we would unite
our families in more than mercantile matters.

62
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,363
The painter does my daughter no justice.

63
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:15,480
Esther is not simply a face,
but a mind and a spirit of rare quality.

64
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,116
I hope your father's and my aspirations
will be fulfilled.

65
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,240
Yes, yes.

66
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:24,242
It has to be your wish also.

67
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,200
- And Esther's?
- Of course. Of course.

68
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,084
Thank you.

69
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:34,045
No, no.
It is for you until you meet in person.

70
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:52,005
- Come with me.
- Would if I could.

71
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,442
Where you are going
is the centre of the world, Messala.

72
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:57,758
Things that would never be possible here
will come your way.

73
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,041
Will you write to us?

74
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,877
I doubt it. I am no hand with a pen.

75
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:09,564
But I'll think of you, all of you.
And I'll miss you.

76
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,955
- And I will come back.
- Promise?

77
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,760
You be safe, Octavius Messala.

78
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:46,076
- We will race again.
- God willing.

79
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:51,116
Forward march!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right, left.

80
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:55,758
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right, left.

81
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,842
Judah! Judah!

82
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:28,958
- This came for you.
- Messala is here.

83
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:31,242
- Open it.
- What does it say?

84
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:43,399
"Judah Ben Hur
is ordered to present himself

85
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:47,082
"to the Garrison Commander
upon receipt of this notice."

86
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, it's to the point.

87
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,316
- Probably written by a scribe.
- It certainly wasn't written by a friend.

88
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:03,119
Well, you better not keep
the Garrison Commander waiting.

89
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,161
Halt.

90
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,039
I see you forgot nothing I taught you.

91
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:22,644
You know what the emperor Octavius
said of Rome?

92
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:26,276
He said, "I found this city built of bricks,
and I left it made of marble."

93
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,244
That is what I intend to say of Jerusalem.

94
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:32,639
That is a remarkable aspiration
for a garrison commander.

95
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:34,319
I won't always be a garrison commander

96
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:38,446
any more than Pontius Pilate
will always be the Governor of Judaea.

97
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,564
We could do great things here
together, you and I.

98
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,683
Marcellus Agrippa's got plans for me.

99
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:47,123
He spent a great deal of money
and influence advancing my career.

100
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:51,359
- Only shows his regard for you as his son.
- No.

101
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:52,846
No, it's his regard for his own future.

102
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,522
He wants a strong man on his side,
someone with military renown to his name.

103
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:59,201
Yes. And he's chosen you, Messala.

104
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,278
No, not quite.
I mean, he still hasn't given me his name.

105
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,597
I am still his unacknowledged bastard.

106
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,201
Begotten of a mistress he abandoned
when he found someone younger.

107
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:09,245
No. My father, the senator,
is a cruel, cunning, capricious man,

108
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:10,885
and those are some of his better qualities.

109
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:18,399
He's given me this chance,
which I am determined to take.

110
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:23,926
The trouble is it's earned me the enmity
of Pontius Pilate.

111
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:28,205
So I must tread carefully.
You can be of help to me, Judah.

112
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,085
Of course, in whatever way I can.

113
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,761
This festival of the Passover.

114
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:37,203
Now should you know of any elements
that plan to disrupt Pilate's arrival,

115
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:39,198
I'd want to know of them.

116
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:42,279
It would reflect badly on me,
you understand?

117
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,555
Are you asking me
to become an informer, Messala?

118
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:50,799
I'm asking you to help preserve the order
of a Roman province.

119
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,240
This is my career, Judah.

120
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,443
I can't afford mistakes.
Not now, not at the start.

121
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:58,156
Pilate, he'd have me removed or demoted,
given a chance.

122
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,238
All I'm asking, between friends,

123
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:03,876
is if you know, or hear, or suspect anything,
just let me know.

124
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,764
Believe me, it saves much worse
if such things can be nipped in the bud.

125
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:17,445
Speaking of nipping in the bud,
which of these do you prefer?

126
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,758
I give you first choice.
I'm nothing if not a generous friend.

127
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,724
If you will excuse me.

128
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:28,439
Shouldn't have thought you suffer
from the Greek affliction.

129
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:31,280
Judah, when may I pay my respects
to your mother?

130
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,437
- She's well I hope?
- She is.

131
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,957
She's looking forward to seeing you.

132
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:39,959
And Tirzah, she must be married by now
at her ripe age?

133
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:45,804
No. Tirzah has set her standards so high
that none of her suitors can meet them.

134
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,196
So there is hope for me yet.

135
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,720
Come and eat with us.

136
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,516
It's good to see you, Judah.

137
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:58,357
We'll do great things here, you and I.

138
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:02,281
A great thing has already come to pass.

139
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,756
You are here with us again.

140
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:15,760
Hey! Let's hurry up. Get a move on.

141
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:21,202
He's a surly bugger,
that foreman of yours, Judah.

142
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,517
- Saves me from having to be one.
- Yes.

143
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,962
Well, that's what I'll be doing
under the new Garrison Commander.

144
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,162
What do you mean?

145
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:30,603
I'm being forced to step down a rank
for some child.

146
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,679
Well, he must the qualifications,
or he wouldn't have been given the post.

147
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:37,043
It's not what you know. It's who you know.

148
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,359
The Governor's none too pleased.
He wanted to make me permanent.

149
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,007
Mind you,
I wouldn't trust Pilate's judgement either.

150
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,078
It's all politics with these buggers.

151
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,364
- That's it then, David.
- All done.

152
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:53,918
- You intend to enter the chariot race, Gaius?
- Is there any other reason to live, Judah?

153
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:58,924
You'll be safe laying a talent on me.

154
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:02,079
It wouldn't do for a Jew to wager
against his own team, now would it?

155
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,318
Suit yourself,
but you'll be throwing your money away.

156
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,760
Shalom!

157
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,997
You see? Didn't even count them.

158
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:12,679
We've already done that, haven't we?

159
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:15,645
Never hurts to rob those bastards
when you get a chance.

160
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:17,558
When you have a business
of your own, David,

161
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:20,161
you'll find out how well it pays
to cheat your customers.

162
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:23,159
Romans are not customers.
They're bloody conquerors.

163
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,680
Sometimes I think you forget that.

164
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:29,363
You know, I appreciate your animosity,
David. Your brother suffered at their hands.

165
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:33,235
Suffered?
Nailed up on a stick is how he suffered.

166
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:36,637
- Three days it took.
- He killed a Roman soldier, did he not?

167
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,683
Whose side are you on, Judah Ben Hur?

168
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:43,397
It is not a question of sides.
We are under Roman occupation.

169
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:47,719
- Now that may be unfortunate, but it's a fact.
- Well, we'll see about that.

170
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,038
You know, a time is coming when
you'll be asked to say where you stand.

171
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,039
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

172
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:55,640
I'm just telling you how it is.

173
00:15:56,887 --> 00:16:01,517
You'll see what happens
when the Governor shows up at Passover.

174
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:05,202
Don't involve me in your conspiracies,
David. You know my position.

175
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:07,005
Pay your taxes and collaborate.

176
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:11,080
You know, you have a way with an argument
that turns into a quarrel.

177
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,445
I wondered when you'd be back.

178
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:31,599
You know, we have Simonides arriving,
bringing you your bride.

179
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,326
That is not funny.

180
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:37,558
You know there has been no understanding
between Esther and myself.

181
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,115
That's not what Simonides thinks.

182
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,359
Anyway, it's about time you were married.
Give us an heir apparent.

183
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,757
David Ben Levi was at me again today.

184
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,156
Why don't you get rid of that man?
He's a zealot.

185
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:54,125
No, Tirzah, he's an excellent overseer,

186
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:57,517
and he knows the business
as well or better than I.

187
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:01,600
I will not dismiss him for convictions
he holds as genuinely as I do my own.

188
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,236
Do you never get tired of being
so reasonable and even-handed, Judah?

189
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,921
People like David Ben Levi are dangerous.

190
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,601
They make life impossible for people like us.

191
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,526
You know, he as much as told me

192
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:18,201
there would be a demonstration
against the Governor at Passover.

193
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,326
- Well, then denounce him.
- You forget yourself, Sister.

194
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,525
We do not denounce our fellow countrymen.

195
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,205
There'll be soldiers everywhere.

196
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,926
You start something,
and there will be a massacre.

197
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:39,202
We should take note
of those who welcome him.

198
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:40,322
Put them on the list.

199
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,922
We must be prepared
to take advantage of any situation.

200
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,475
All of us should be armed
so we may strike a blow.

201
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,202
Leave us.

202
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,720
- So, you came.
- To warn you.

203
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,718
Judah, we are already warned.

204
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,116
Every day we see our enemy.
We know who they are.

205
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,765
The new Garrison Commander is determined

206
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,566
that nothing interfere
with the arrival of Pontius Pilate.

207
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:28,276
He will be on the alert,
and he will take action,

208
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,439
drastic action,
in the event of any disturbance.

209
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,085
You think this is news to us?

210
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,078
I know this Garrison Commander,

211
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:38,079
and he will not risk his reputation
on such an occasion.

212
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:42,160
- You know him?
- Octavius Messala is my friend.

213
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:46,806
That friend, you don't want anything
to spoil his big day.

214
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:51,483
I don't want to see any more men crucified
or sent to the galleys.

215
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:57,003
Very well, you've done your part.
You've warned us.

216
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:00,716
Now can I have your word
you will not betray us?

217
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:06,078
Were that in my mind, it would have been
a Roman who knocked at your door.

218
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:58,164
He must have changed to speak
in such a way to you, his best friend.

219
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:02,923
Of course he has changed, Tirzah.
He is a man, a soldier. He has been to war.

220
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:09,801
But he never forgot us. That much I know.
And he is glad to be back.

221
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,679
- What of his father? Did he speak of him?
- Not with any great affection, I'm afraid.

222
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:19,716
He referred to him always
as Marcellus Agrippa or the senator.

223
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,402
Poor boy.

224
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,797
And when can we expect an audience
with the poor boy?

225
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,447
He will dine with us in a few days.

226
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,597
And I hope you will manage
a more welcoming manner, Sister.

227
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,282
I have not invited him under our roof
to have him mocked.

228
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:37,197
You will see for yourself
how much he has changed

229
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:40,962
and how much he is still the same Messala
we knew and loved.

230
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,922
For we did love him, did we not?

231
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:47,124
- Yes. Yes, we did.
- Yes.

232
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:50,000
And we shall again.

233
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:53,760
- Judah!
- Here they are at last.

234
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:55,037
Greetings and welcome.

235
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,276
Let me present my daughter.

236
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,795
Esther.

237
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,840
Welcome, Esther, daughter of Simonides.

238
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:23,484
It is my honour and my family's.

239
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,115
Welcome.

240
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,322
I saw her face, Judah.

241
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:40,524
- Saw what?
- That she was not disappointed.

242
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:56,801
I do not like to see birds kept captive,

243
00:22:56,887 --> 00:23:00,721
but my father says they are never free
of the chains of the sky.

244
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,001
Indeed.

245
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:07,242
You need not approve
my father's nonsense, Judah.

246
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:10,763
Do you really think these creatures
would not wish to fly away at this moment

247
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,522
- if I opened their cage?
- Perhaps.

248
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:17,405
Although they might not survive for long.

249
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:22,402
If I were they,
I should wish to have the choice.

250
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,320
How happy I am to see Jerusalem at last.

251
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:30,517
To you it is a familiar sight, I know.

252
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,679
But I, too, often stand here
and admire this view.

253
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:37,203
It is the city of our faith,
and while we have it,

254
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:40,643
we have our centre, our heart.

255
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,086
Forgive me. I have a tendency to pontificate.
I do not mean to...

256
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:50,763
No, no, go on. Please, continue.

257
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:58,838
Esther, I realise your father has
certain expectations

258
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:01,158
as did my father,

259
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:05,039
and you should know that
I am not opposed to their wishes.

260
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:11,597
But you think we should make
our own choice in a matter so important?

261
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,403
As you say.

262
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:46,565
Be you betrothed to me with this, my wealth.

263
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,277
For the first couple of years I was in Rome,
I didn't even see Marcellus Agrippa.

264
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,959
It was all military training.

265
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:26,402
Poor Messala, learning how to be a soldier.

266
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:30,765
It has its compensations.
The ladies of Rome are very patriotic.

267
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:34,364
Did you teach them to catch the stick?

268
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:37,166
Your father must be so proud of you.

269
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:39,238
No. I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

270
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:41,921
He's expectant, maybe, but...

271
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,042
I'm not ungrateful.

272
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:47,518
He has given me so much advice,
advice which has stood the test of reality.

273
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:52,044
"He over whom you have no power
has power over you." That's his motto.

274
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:55,119
Power, he says,
is the only currency worth hoarding.

275
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:57,243
It never loses its value.

276
00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:00,956
But there are powers other
than those Marcellus Agrippa speaks of.

277
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:05,643
Of faith, of family, of friends, fair dealing.

278
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:07,957
In Rome, no such powers prevail.

279
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:12,199
Even Tiberius, our emperor, gave up
his beloved wife and his three children

280
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,881
to make a dynastic marriage
with his brother's widow.

281
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,446
Everyone applauded his wisdom.

282
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:19,166
I think that not wisdom
but an affront against God.

283
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:21,761
Whose god? Yours?

284
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:26,841
Rome and its values are not for you, Esther,
nor my friend, your husband-to-be.

285
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:30,078
But they're for those whose ambitions
remain unchecked by conscience,

286
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:34,160
whose loyalty can be purchased
by advancement and coin.

287
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:36,715
And have you become such a one, Messala?

288
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:40,526
I have.

289
00:26:42,287 --> 00:26:44,039
I mean, I think I have.

290
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,961
But such is my fate.

291
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:50,720
We are all in the hands of the gods,
are we not?

292
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:53,037
Such is our belief.

293
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:57,601
So have you given any thought
to what I said earlier?

294
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:00,724
Regarding provocations, disturbances
and so forth?

295
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:03,442
It is as I have told you.

296
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:05,882
I will have no hand in any demonstration
against Rome.

297
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,286
I know.

298
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,717
I talk of hearsay, rumour.

299
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:15,556
Nothing?

300
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:20,721
- Why do you question your friend's word?
- He hasn't given me his word. Have you?

301
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,684
Is it so much to ask assurance of a friend?

302
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,519
Come, you need only ask Gaius Antonius

303
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:27,679
to know that the Hur family
have always cooperated with Rome.

304
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:29,166
I'm asking Judah.

305
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,842
It does Rome no credit to impugn a friend
under his own roof

306
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,246
while in receipt of hospitality.

307
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,682
I impugn no one. I do as my duty requires.

308
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,565
Is it so much to ask for Judah's word?

309
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:43,804
- I give you my word.
- Thank you.

310
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:47,516
Shame on you, Octavius Messala,
to speak so to those who love you.

311
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:52,317
Daughter, Messala is a guest and our friend.

312
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,684
- Apologise to him.
- No.

313
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:01,436
I should apologise. I spoke out of turn.

314
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:07,239
Thank you, Judah.
It's of great comfort to me.

315
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:15,039
To all our futures. May they be happy
and prosperous, however brief.

316
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:26,317
She's got a mind of her own, Esther.
You should have a care, Judah.

317
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:28,841
When she takes the reins,
she'll ride you hard.

318
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:30,519
And your sister.

319
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,000
You should know I've contrived

320
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:41,043
to have Pilate's procession pass here
in front of the house

321
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:43,163
so you'll have the chance to see me
in all my pomp.

322
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:46,239
I'll be the handsome one on the white horse.

323
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,566
Forgive me.

324
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:59,075
You know, half my performance
is to convince myself.

325
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:15,405
Messala, no need of forgiveness.

326
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,285
Go with God and be yourself tomorrow.

327
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:20,958
All will be well.

328
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:25,560
Forward!

329
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,956
March. Left, right. Left, right.

330
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,515
Left. Left. Left.

331
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:34,680
Have a care, Judah.
He could be a dangerous enemy.

332
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,485
And a more dangerous friend.

333
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:12,636
At the first sign of any trouble,
any demonstration from the crowd, quell it.

334
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,604
Use the butt end to begin with,

335
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:19,715
but if that proves unavailing,
give them the blade. Is that understood?

336
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:21,365
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

337
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:28,083
We should be bringing Pilate
to the Garrison direct.

338
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,920
Keep him on the main streets.
We'll have clear space on either side.

339
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:32,360
The lower city is too narrow.

340
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:36,403
You make it seem as if I were
sneaking Pilate through the back door.

341
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,125
I don't think he'd appreciate
the caution, Gaius.

342
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:40,846
I think he might find it
an affront to his vanity.

343
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:43,521
Your job is to protect, not to flatter.

344
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,122
There speaks a voice
with no concern for politics.

345
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,482
And who thanks the gods for it.

346
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:11,401
Go home, Romans.

347
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:14,047
- Keep on riding.
- Go back where you came from.

348
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:16,561
Have respect, Romans.

349
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:19,036
You have no respect.

350
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,316
A sullen lot, these Jews.

351
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:38,082
Better to be obeyed
than beloved, Excellency.

352
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,919
Drop back a length.

353
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:51,960
Go home, Romans.

354
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:54,083
Have some shame, Romans.

355
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,040
Go on.

356
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:39,598
There's Pilate at the front,
gleaming like a brass pot.

357
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,640
Messala does look splendid, I must say.

358
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,395
Look out!

359
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:24,765
Do something.

360
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:28,801
Seize him!

361
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,360
Seize him!

362
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,245
Arrest Judah.

363
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:47,596
Move!

364
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:19,920
It was an accident. A tile fell from...

365
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,439
It was an accident. Please!
It was an accident!

366
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:27,802
- Judah.
- Tirzah.

367
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,560
It was an accident! Judah!

368
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:38,042
In broad daylight,
an attack on Rome's emissary.

369
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:42,359
Tiberius will hear of this and of
your incompetence, you place-bought fool!

370
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:47,157
I will have you removed, you hear?
Sent to the furthest reaches of the Empire!

371
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,317
Am I not injured enough?

372
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,201
I could have been killed.

373
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,403
Those responsible are under arrest,
Excellency.

374
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,877
Crucify them!
The weapon could have pierced my skull.

375
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,124
Well, what are you waiting for?
I said crucify them.

376
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:07,760
- Excellency, it is the feast of the Passover.
- I know that!

377
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:11,556
That's why I am here
to make Rome's presence felt.

378
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,525
Who are these rebels?

379
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:17,041
One of the foremost
of the Jewish families in Jerusalem.

380
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:18,799
Judah Ben Hur and his mother and sister.

381
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,560
Well, make an example of them.
Crucify the man and garrotte the women.

382
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,363
Do you hear me?

383
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:25,566
Thank God. Are my mother and Tirzah safe?

384
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,925
You have more to concern you
than their welfare.

385
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,441
You attempted to kill his Excellency,
Pontius Pilate.

386
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:37,555
Messala, it was an accident.
A tile fell from the roof.

387
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:40,161
When the governor of a Roman province
is attacked in the street,

388
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:42,522
it is not an accident.
It is a rebellion against Rome.

389
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:43,722
Have you gone mad?

390
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:47,925
- You gave a signal for the riot to begin.
- You cannot believe that.

391
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:54,925
- My family and I are your friends.
- You and your family have destroyed me!

392
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,759
Do you understand that?

393
00:37:56,847 --> 00:38:00,283
Messala, I knew nothing.

394
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:04,519
Liar! You lied last night.
I saw it in your eyes.

395
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:06,836
Admit it.

396
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:14,204
Give me the names of the other plotters,
the ones you signalled, you and your family!

397
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:16,960
Don't threaten my family.

398
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,477
They are even more blameless than I.

399
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:24,759
Let me go before Pilate and explain.

400
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,281
He wants you crucified,

401
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:31,599
and your mother and sister
to be executed by strangulation.

402
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,724
- No! No!
- Hear me, Judah.

403
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:37,446
You have destroyed the house of Hur
and me with it.

404
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:41,042
- Messala, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

405
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:44,039
Where there is a war, someone must go to it,

406
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:47,278
and it will not be me.

407
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:54,043
Messala! Messala! Messala!

408
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,641
These two are going to get the wire.

409
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,485
Be assured my report will make clear
that it was your incompetence

410
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:18,682
that led to this insult to the Emperor.

411
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,440
- Excellency...
- Silence!

412
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:26,282
I'm dismissing you as Garrison Commander
and reinstating Gaius Antonius.

413
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:32,598
And trust me, your patron, Senator Agrippa,
will not intervene this time

414
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:36,316
to keep you in a post
for which you are manifestly unfit.

415
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:11,078
Get up! Up, come on. I said get up!

416
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:17,476
All right, get out of here, you.

417
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,999
Forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

418
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:27,559
For they know not what they do.
Forgive them.

419
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:55,119
Simonides! Simonides! Simonides!

420
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:04,084
Am I not to be crucified?

421
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,318
No such luck.
Your sentence has been changed.

422
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:08,635
You're for the galleys.

423
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:12,800
A year from now, you'll be wishing
they'd put you up on a stick.

424
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:34,398
You are now under the command
of Quintus Arrius,

425
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:36,842
commander of the Southern Fleet

426
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,284
and victor
of the Battle of the Corinth Straits.

427
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:46,236
You have been chosen
to carry His Excellency

428
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:49,080
to receive reward for his service

429
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:53,683
from the hand
of the Emperor Tiberius himself.

430
00:41:54,847 --> 00:42:00,558
You may consider yourselves honoured
and will acquit your duty accordingly,

431
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:04,003
or by the gods, you will answer to me.

432
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:06,798
Honoured, do you hear?

433
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:11,444
Silence! Silence at the oars.

434
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:18,877
Let every man know that any infraction
will be severely dealt with.

435
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:21,879
Severely dealt with just for a change.

436
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:25,004
Prepare to increase.

437
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:31,879
And stroke. And stroke. And stroke.

438
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,997
Quintus Arrius.

439
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:44,157
He is the one who cleaned out the pirates,

440
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:48,320
and honoured we are
to be rowing him to Rome.

441
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,440
You feeling honoured, Number 40?

442
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:57,124
They killed my wife,

443
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:02,563
and my daughter, and my son.

444
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:07,437
They create a wilderness and call it peace.

445
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:11,520
Every night I dream, my friend.

446
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:17,438
Then I wake up, but I'm still Number 41.

447
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:24,686
Do you ever think maybe it's all a bad dream,

448
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:27,967
and death is when you wake from it?

449
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:30,724
Go to sleep, Antegua.

450
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:37,646
Dream of killing Romans and kill one for me,
Number 40.

451
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:17,566
They have two anklets. Is one not enough?

452
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:21,363
I switch the rowers from port to starboard
on a regular basis, Excellency.

453
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:24,359
It keeps them better balanced.
It requires being able to chain them

454
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,041
to battle stations
whichever side they are rowing.

455
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:30,278
And does the result outweigh the cost
for the extra anklets?

456
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,676
Yes, sir, they are better oarsmen for it.

457
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:35,327
Well, commendations, Hortator.

458
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,602
Thank you, Excellency.

459
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:41,443
He did not tell you it was Number 40's idea.

460
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:45,157
Silence at the oars!

461
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:48,876
- Whose idea was it, Number 41?
- Number 40's.

462
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:58,077
Is this true, Number 40?

463
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:01,924
Would Number 41 lie to Quintus Arrius?

464
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:05,441
He mentioned it to me, Excellency.

465
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,805
And you took the advice of a galley slave?

466
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:17,761
Congratulations on having an open mind.

467
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:39,522
The thing of it is,

468
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,757
I am not afraid of death.

469
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:47,437
Either it will be better than this,
or it will be nothing,

470
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:49,802
which will be better than this.

471
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,238
What are you afraid of?

472
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:55,561
Nothing.

473
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:59,359
I am afraid of going down in the chains.

474
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:09,676
On your feet.

475
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,997
We're only just off the oars.

476
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,918
You're wanted up top.

477
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:35,560
You're going to see His Excellency.

478
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:37,797
You mind your mouth in there.

479
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:41,357
I don't want any of your smart opinions
about how to run a galley.

480
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:43,039
Is that clear?

481
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,479
Come on.

482
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:52,436
- Pull them out.
- Pull out! Pull it.

483
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:54,882
Watch the side.

484
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:56,639
Right ship, turn!

485
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:03,355
Come.

486
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,358
Number 40, Excellency.

487
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:17,722
I don't suppose you know much
about naval strategy, do you, Number 40?

488
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:19,763
Mine is not the best place to learn.

489
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:23,362
Then why would you suggest the hortator
switch the rowers from side to side?

490
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:24,960
I believe he explained the reason.

491
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:28,198
The rowers would be better balanced.
Yes, he did.

492
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:29,561
But why would you care?

493
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:34,402
Efficiency is better than it's opposite,
even for a galley slave.

494
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,001
How long have you been at the oars?

495
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:50,203
Almost three years.

496
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:53,643
Well, you are certainly thriving on it.

497
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:56,161
How long did you get?

498
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:58,158
There was no limit put on my sentence.

499
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:00,886
And what did you do to deserve that?

500
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:03,640
I was betrayed by a friend.

501
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:07,322
Well, that usually carries
a maximum penalty.

502
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:23,758
Are you going to tell me now
that you are entirely innocent?

503
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:26,236
Well, if we lived in Rome
it wouldn't be worth comment,

504
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:29,364
so commonplace it would be.

505
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:31,483
That is little consolation

506
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:34,798
when you have been wrongfully accused
and convicted without a hearing,

507
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:39,324
your family destroyed, and all on the word
of one who was your friend.

508
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:42,520
Well, I'm surprised

509
00:48:42,607 --> 00:48:46,282
that a man with your education
and intelligence has lasted so long.

510
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:49,245
This work is for unthinking brutes.

511
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:52,558
I've had encouragement in that direction.

512
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,005
Come. Come.

513
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:04,720
Sir. Three ships sighted.
Just put out from the headland.

514
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:06,081
They are pirates for sure.

515
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:08,522
They have the land breeze,
but they're no match for our rowers.

516
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,518
We can outrun them.

517
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:15,044
Outrun? No, no, no, no.

518
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:18,597
Outmanoeuvre, outthink, outfight,
but not outrun.

519
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:22,646
In case the news gets back to Rome,
and it's converted to running away.

520
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:25,287
Quintus Arrius does not run away.

521
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:30,082
Off you go, Number 40, and take the grapes.

522
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,964
It will sweeten your stroke.

523
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,484
What is that?

524
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:18,320
Trumpet calling us to battle stations.

525
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:23,523
I was dreaming
I was in a garden drinking sherbet.

526
00:50:24,727 --> 00:50:26,558
I can taste it.

527
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:29,526
Battle stations.

528
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:32,720
Three pirates came out to greet us.

529
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:36,401
May they capture us and kill all the Romans.

530
00:50:36,487 --> 00:50:38,603
May we kill those they leave behind.

531
00:50:42,327 --> 00:50:44,443
We're going to port.

532
00:50:58,207 --> 00:51:01,165
It's your lucky day, isn't it, Number 40?

533
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:11,604
Battle stations!

534
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:15,075
Battle stations!

535
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:17,918
Oars out!

536
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:22,720
And stroke.

537
00:51:22,807 --> 00:51:27,403
And stroke. And stroke.

538
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,284
Port! Hold!

539
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:35,000
Port, oars in! Hold!

540
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:38,002
Coming about.

541
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:44,237
- Secure port.
- Hold steady!

542
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:50,640
Port, withdraw!

543
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:53,837
And stroke.

544
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:58,195
And stroke. And stroke.

545
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:00,604
And stroke.

546
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:02,405
And stroke.

547
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:09,955
And stroke. And stroke.

548
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:14,241
And stroke. And stroke.

549
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:20,560
Give me speed!

550
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:24,117
Stroke. And stroke. And stroke.

551
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,879
Archers at the ready!

552
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:27,798
- Ready arrows.
- Hold formation.

553
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:29,362
Hold your position.

554
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:33,960
Starboard in.

555
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:38,126
Release!

556
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:44,598
Oars out!

557
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,117
And stroke.

558
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:55,166
And stroke. And stroke.

559
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:03,283
Port, in!

560
00:53:04,327 --> 00:53:05,806
Hold!

561
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:07,795
How many?

562
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:11,756
Two more.

563
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:15,362
Port, withdraw!

564
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:19,918
And stroke, and stroke.

565
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:21,759
And stroke.

566
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:27,680
Ramming speed!

567
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:29,837
Ramming speed!

568
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:31,883
And stroke.

569
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:35,437
And stroke. And stroke.

570
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:37,404
And stroke.

571
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:47,684
And stroke. And stroke.

572
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:50,998
And stroke. And stroke.

573
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:13,840
Back oars. Back oars! Back oars!

574
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,517
Judah, unlock the chains!

575
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:36,805
The chains!

576
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:39,800
The chains!

577
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,076
Quickly, Judah.

578
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:53,356
Judah.

579
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,605
It's no use.

580
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:30,679
Go, Number 40, and kill a Roman for me.

581
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:35,437
Don't let me drown in these chains.

582
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:10,879
You?

583
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:13,197
Number 40.

584
00:58:13,287 --> 00:58:14,720
Who else?

585
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,243
Are there other survivors?

586
00:58:20,327 --> 00:58:22,557
There's been no sign.

587
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:26,406
This needs to come out.

588
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:28,205
Not if it's barbed.

589
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,118
Try.

590
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,483
One good pull. It's an order, Number 40!

591
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,804
It's very clever.

592
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:05,721
Detach blade so it stays in the body.

593
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:16,843
The Great Quintus Arrius
adrift with a slave in his hour of triumph.

594
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:18,121
You are still alive.

595
00:59:18,207 --> 00:59:21,119
You mean I am not dead.
There's a difference.

596
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:23,159
I know the difference.

597
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:27,445
Well, the gods
have their own sense of humour.

598
00:59:27,527 --> 00:59:30,439
I trust you still believe in your god.

599
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:34,156
How can I say other
when I am delivered from my chains?

600
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:35,885
Not by a god.

601
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,723
Before each battle,

602
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:42,241
I unchain one rower.

603
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:44,557
Why?

604
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:49,516
Call it a reminder of humility,
an antidote to hubris,

605
00:59:49,607 --> 00:59:53,156
or simply habit.

606
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:55,761
Why me?

607
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,636
Maybe I like the way you eat grapes.

608
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:24,086
What?

609
01:00:28,527 --> 01:00:30,324
What is it?

610
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:31,556
A sail.

611
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:38,083
I will not be taken by pirates.

612
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,845
If this is a pirate ship,
you must not let them take me.

613
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:48,445
So having saved your life, I should take it
to save you from the oars.

614
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:54,726
If this is a Roman ship,
I will not let them take you back.

615
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:59,517
You will come to Rome as my slave.
This is a better form of servitude.

616
01:00:59,607 --> 01:01:02,838
You have my word on it, Number 40.

617
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:06,044
My name is Judah Ben Hur.

618
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:11,205
You have my word, Judah Ben Hur.

619
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:23,760
Hey! Hey! Hey!

620
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:28,242
Hey!

621
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:40,881
Their chieftain is here as you ordered.

622
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:42,116
His family?

623
01:01:42,207 --> 01:01:43,959
The women killed themselves.

624
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:48,199
He was only taken alive with great difficulty.
It cost us three men.

625
01:02:04,527 --> 01:02:05,960
Will we crucify him, sir?

626
01:02:06,047 --> 01:02:08,880
No. Keep him alive.

627
01:02:08,967 --> 01:02:11,083
I have a better idea.

628
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:28,723
My son will receive his reward
at the hands of Tiberius himself

629
01:02:28,807 --> 01:02:30,286
when he returns to Rome.

630
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:32,756
Such are his triumphs against the Thracians.

631
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,556
Well, I am glad that your son
has finally made you proud.

632
01:02:38,647 --> 01:02:41,719
You've waited a long time
for a return on your investment.

633
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:45,436
Bastards got on mistresses
need time to prove themselves.

634
01:02:47,607 --> 01:02:50,405
And at least I will have a son
to carry on my name.

635
01:02:50,487 --> 01:02:54,162
So, Marcellus,
you've seen fit to bestow it on him.

636
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:57,122
I need Tiberius' approval.

637
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,516
Well, you know how he likes
a man to die without heirs,

638
01:02:59,607 --> 01:03:02,565
so that all his estates
are subject to his decree.

639
01:03:02,647 --> 01:03:07,402
Well, let's pray he survives you
to carry on your illustrious name.

640
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:09,364
Quite so.

641
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:11,517
I hope to prevail on Tiberius

642
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:14,838
to grant Octavius Messala
the governorship of Judaea.

643
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:18,078
Replace that wretch who did so much
to obstruct his advancement.

644
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,885
And Tiberius will grant this favour?

645
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,527
There are ways to influence an emperor.

646
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:24,404
My Thracian will take his fancy,

647
01:03:24,487 --> 01:03:27,923
and of course,
Athene can be most persuasive.

648
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:31,886
Gods.

649
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,037
I feel the need of a little intestinal relief.

650
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:36,486
Excuse me.

651
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:51,959
I can give you something to dull the pain.

652
01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:59,042
And how do you feel about
being on loan to our Emperor?

653
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:02,085
I am a whore. How should I feel?

654
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:25,236
So which is your
galley-slave-turned-gladiator?

655
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:27,966
The blond one.

656
01:04:29,447 --> 01:04:32,723
But he's no gladiator. He's my body servant.

657
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:40,036
Skilled in arms.

658
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:44,199
What, does the victor
of the Corinth Straits fear assassination

659
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,006
that he must go guarded in the streets?

660
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:50,159
He's beautiful, your body servant.

661
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:53,522
Indeed.

662
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:55,040
You pick well, Quintus.

663
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:56,640
We chose each other.

664
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,202
Chose each other, did we?

665
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,280
Enough! Enough!

666
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:20,562
You improve day by day.

667
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:27,922
A fine looking specimen.

668
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:32,319
What say you match him
against my Thracian before the Emperor?

669
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:33,806
There is no likelihood of that.

670
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:37,243
I value him too much
to see him butchered for your amusement.

671
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:39,045
I'll give you odds.

672
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:44,556
He's learning well, and he's learning fast.

673
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,399
- Could you have killed him?
- Today?

674
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:48,762
Only about a half dozen times.

675
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:14,564
I am Athene.

676
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:15,966
Judah.

677
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:19,005
So you are a Jew, and I am a Greek.

678
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:25,322
Both of us conquered peoples
subject to the will of Rome and Romans.

679
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:32,002
We should make a common cause
while we have the chance.

680
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:36,598
If you'll excuse me.

681
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,038
Did you...

682
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:50,483
The Greek, did she take you to her bed?

683
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:54,484
She's not to my taste.

684
01:06:55,767 --> 01:07:01,683
Judah, no...
Don't make me laugh. It hurts too much.

685
01:07:07,287 --> 01:07:08,436
Go to her.

686
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:12,198
Are you asking me
to sleep with this woman?

687
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:15,438
No. I'm ordering you to.

688
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,756
It will not be such a hardship.

689
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:22,435
Why would you wish it?

690
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:26,236
Because Marcellus Agrippa wants it.

691
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:28,397
Marcellus Agrippa?

692
01:07:28,487 --> 01:07:32,162
He uses her for his ends,
few of which are carnal.

693
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:37,325
She will inquire of things he wants to know.
Such as, what you are to me,

694
01:07:37,407 --> 01:07:40,763
how long you think I will last,
and who are my heirs.

695
01:07:41,447 --> 01:07:43,039
Why does he want to know these things?

696
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:45,641
Because in Rome, knowledge is power.

697
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:49,083
And he over whom you do not have power
has power over you.

698
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,556
I see you've learned the ways
of the lmperium.

699
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:53,444
I had a good teacher.

700
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:59,158
Have your physicians no remedy
for your pain?

701
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:01,363
No, I have had my fill with them.

702
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:03,403
When my time comes,
I will take the pink bath.

703
01:08:03,487 --> 01:08:05,682
- The Roman way.
- Yes.

704
01:08:06,327 --> 01:08:10,320
Come, rest now. All will be well.

705
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:22,486
Judah, I will have you as my heir

706
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,877
to have at your disposal my estates,
my name.

707
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:31,758
And to go with them, Roman citizenship

708
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:35,556
and a full pardon
for all charges held against you.

709
01:08:35,647 --> 01:08:37,365
What of your kin?

710
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:42,680
I have none, saving you now, Sextus Arrius.

711
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:49,879
Sextus was my son. He died many years ago
in a plague with his mother.

712
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:52,720
You do me honour to give me his name.

713
01:08:52,807 --> 01:08:56,117
Then all I ask is you do not disgrace it.

714
01:08:56,207 --> 01:08:59,358
No more than I would my own father's.

715
01:08:59,447 --> 01:09:02,120
Then we are both well pleased, my son.

716
01:09:03,127 --> 01:09:04,560
Come.

717
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,961
You know, I cannot rest
until I've had my revenge

718
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:17,561
upon he who killed my mother and sister.

719
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:19,444
Octavius Messala.

720
01:09:24,487 --> 01:09:28,082
Emperor, my sources report
that Pontius Pilate is inept,

721
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:31,762
incompetent, and corrupt, and that Judaea,
were it administered properly,

722
01:09:31,847 --> 01:09:36,204
would contribute five times the sum
you presently receive from its taxes.

723
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:42,519
Octavius Messala
would assure these revenues.

724
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:47,476
Indeed, I will guarantee them in advance,
such is my confidence in his abilities.

725
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:55,236
I was never handsome.

726
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,399
My mother said
I was her least favourite child.

727
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:03,804
Do me justice but no favours,
do you understand?

728
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:10,846
Tell me, Marcellus,
is this not the same Octavius Messala

729
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:14,522
who not four years ago was sent abroad
in disgrace by Pontius Pilate

730
01:10:14,607 --> 01:10:17,724
for conspicuous neglect of his duties?

731
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:20,367
A contrivance against him

732
01:10:20,447 --> 01:10:24,042
so that Pilate could re-install
his own favourite.

733
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:26,561
Messala knows these Jews.

734
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:29,320
He's lived amongst them.
He speaks their language,

735
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:32,205
knows their customs. He has assured me...

736
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:34,084
I will consider it.

737
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:37,597
I could ask no more.

738
01:10:37,687 --> 01:10:41,566
What's this I hear
about some gladiator you own?

739
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:47,324
Yes. My Thracian.

740
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:49,875
Sent to me by Messala.

741
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:52,401
Already he has three kills to his credit.

742
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:54,318
I shall like to see him in action.

743
01:10:54,407 --> 01:10:56,557
By your decree, Emperor.

744
01:10:56,647 --> 01:11:00,879
But I am having difficulty
in finding him opponents

745
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:03,686
or perhaps I should say victims.

746
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:07,885
I challenged Quintus Arrius to put
his young protg up against him,

747
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:10,117
but he prizes him too much.

748
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:13,916
I think perhaps there is more to that matter
than meets the eye.

749
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:16,362
There usually is.

750
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:20,520
But I doubt Quintus Arrius
uses bum boys as gladiators.

751
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:24,846
Well, we must find some way

752
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:29,239
of having your prodigy
entertain us at my next gathering.

753
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:32,922
At the Emperor's command, it shall be done.

754
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:06,440
I didn't expect virginity along with virility.

755
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,522
But I am honoured to receive it.

756
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:20,275
You must allow me the privilege
of advancing your education.

757
01:12:20,367 --> 01:12:23,439
And why would you do that?

758
01:12:23,527 --> 01:12:27,725
I might teach you to pleasure me
as well as yourself.

759
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:33,518
And some day you might have a wife
who would appreciate such skills.

760
01:12:33,607 --> 01:12:38,840
And it would give you the time to find out
whatever Marcellus Agrippa bid you learn.

761
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:43,764
You may tell me what you please or not.

762
01:12:43,847 --> 01:12:46,964
But did not Quintus Arrius
bid you do the same?

763
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:54,116
We will not quarrel over this.

764
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:01,199
Marcellus Agrippa.

765
01:13:02,487 --> 01:13:03,522
He has a son.

766
01:13:04,807 --> 01:13:08,880
Octavius Messala. Do you know him?

767
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:13,287
A great hero by all accounts.

768
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:16,837
No doubt,
I will have the chance to judge for myself.

769
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:29,526
I see I have your attention again.

770
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:38,286
This time, keep in mind
that it is not a sprint.

771
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:57,996
Look at this.

772
01:13:58,087 --> 01:14:02,319
I would exchange it all
to be once more on the battlefield.

773
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:08,641
Did you not find it so, Quintus Arrius,
that war is so much simpler than life?

774
01:14:08,727 --> 01:14:11,446
But one cannot make war forever.

775
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:14,325
There comes a time
when you have to put the sword down.

776
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,921
Especially when you can't hold it.

777
01:14:21,687 --> 01:14:24,963
My dear Quintus, you look worse than I do.

778
01:14:25,047 --> 01:14:29,438
Shall I send for my physician?
He has not killed me yet.

779
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:33,520
No, I have made my own arrangements.
But I thank the Emperor.

780
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,798
- Then what can I do?
- For me, nothing.

781
01:14:40,007 --> 01:14:44,205
But I would have your approval
of my intention

782
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:49,805
to leave all I possess, including my name,
to someone of whom I have become fond.

783
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:55,436
To whom, indeed, I owe my life,
what is left of it.

784
01:14:55,527 --> 01:14:57,916
This is your galley slave?

785
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,601
The one that Marcellus speaks of
as your catamite?

786
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:03,565
He is my companion, nothing more.

787
01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:05,524
My dear Quintus,

788
01:15:05,607 --> 01:15:09,486
you are at liberty to bequeath
your name, and its fame,

789
01:15:09,567 --> 01:15:11,717
and all you possess to whom you choose.

790
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:14,082
Your service to Rome and its laws
grant you that.

791
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:17,398
But in Rome, the supreme law is yours.

792
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:24,244
So how is it a galley slave
saves the life of an admiral?

793
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,001
By the will of the gods.

794
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:33,159
Indeed, we do amuse ourselves
in the most peculiar fashion sometimes.

795
01:15:36,127 --> 01:15:39,085
Very well. If that is what you wish.

796
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:42,961
But I must meet this fortunate young fellow.

797
01:15:43,047 --> 01:15:46,198
Bring him to my next masque.

798
01:15:46,287 --> 01:15:47,606
I am in your debt.

799
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:51,966
I may require you to acknowledge that
before you slip anchor.

800
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,436
I wouldn't delay your request long.

801
01:15:54,527 --> 01:15:57,325
I wouldn't want to disappoint my Emperor.

802
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:05,164
- May I...
- You may.

803
01:16:28,127 --> 01:16:29,560
Emperor.

804
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:32,286
Emperor.

805
01:16:39,847 --> 01:16:43,396
I have the honour
of presenting to you my son,

806
01:16:43,487 --> 01:16:44,715
Sextus Arrius.

807
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:49,162
Well, let me have a look at the paragon.

808
01:16:49,247 --> 01:16:51,602
Take off your mask, Sextus.

809
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,116
I hear you are no mean man at arms.

810
01:17:00,207 --> 01:17:03,882
I am but an apprentice at the trade, Emperor.

811
01:17:03,967 --> 01:17:08,085
Well, I hope to have some evidence
of your prowess.

812
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:17,481
I would have your new-found heir
display his skills for us, Quintus Arrius.

813
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:19,046
In what manner?

814
01:17:19,127 --> 01:17:21,482
Why, by combat.

815
01:17:21,567 --> 01:17:24,684
I hadn't thought
that such a display would be necessary.

816
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:27,839
Did I not say that you were in my debt,

817
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:32,603
and did you not tell me
I must make haste to have it repaid?

818
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:34,086
I am the Emperor's to command.

819
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:38,645
What of the Thracian of yours?

820
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:40,957
At the Emperor's pleasure.

821
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:45,046
Emperor, this was not my understanding.

822
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:49,086
There is no understanding but mine,
Quintus Arrius!

823
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:51,283
Replace your mask.

824
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:55,246
You do not have my permission
to show your face!

825
01:18:26,887 --> 01:18:29,720
Sword against spear,
the best of all the pairings.

826
01:18:30,727 --> 01:18:32,479
Is it to your satisfaction?

827
01:18:34,527 --> 01:18:35,880
If they know how to use them.

828
01:18:35,967 --> 01:18:39,323
I can assure you my Thracian does.

829
01:18:39,407 --> 01:18:41,159
And what about your Sextus?

830
01:19:37,407 --> 01:19:40,126
Emperor, Emperor, I beg you.

831
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:01,236
Kill him.

832
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:22,637
Emperor!

833
01:20:22,727 --> 01:20:24,445
It seems you were right.

834
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:27,559
The gods amuse themselves
in a peculiar way.

835
01:20:32,807 --> 01:20:35,958
Emperor. The man was mad. Emperor?

836
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:05,999
Your god, he sets his hand
against self-slaughter, does he not?

837
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:16,485
It is hard to tell with gods
whether they care about our ways,

838
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:21,925
or whether, indeed,
they are anything but our fancies

839
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:24,566
writ large.

840
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:30,678
Well, I shall know soon enough. Or not.

841
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,603
For waiting for me is

842
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:38,116
maybe a sudden darkness.

843
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:42,922
Do not grieve unduly.

844
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:46,443
I have had about as much life
as one can live.

845
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:50,157
You have a long way to go, my son.

846
01:22:00,687 --> 01:22:04,077
Do not spend it all in vengeance.

847
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:08,479
Do not sour it with hatred.

848
01:22:31,127 --> 01:22:33,482
Maybe there are no gods.

849
01:22:33,567 --> 01:22:37,560
Maybe one lives on in others.

850
01:22:38,447 --> 01:22:42,156
So when you eat a grape, you think of me.

851
01:23:28,847 --> 01:23:31,315
Your grief does you credit.

852
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:34,956
Who would not grieve
such a man as Quintus Arrius?

853
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:37,515
There are many dry eyes, I assure you.

854
01:23:37,607 --> 01:23:40,326
Yes. Well...

855
01:23:42,927 --> 01:23:45,885
Marcellus has other concerns, does he not?

856
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:49,156
Has he managed to placate the Emperor?

857
01:23:49,247 --> 01:23:51,238
We are doing our best.

858
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,802
He's persistent, my master.

859
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:58,675
We are headed to Jerusalem
to meet his son at the games.

860
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:02,445
He means to have him installed there
as his new governor.

861
01:24:04,647 --> 01:24:07,286
My condolences on your loss.

862
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:11,997
But you'll soon feel better, Sextus Arrius,
now that you have your late father's estates.

863
01:24:12,087 --> 01:24:15,079
Perhaps we will meet again
in more cheerful circumstances.

864
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,840
At your son's investiture in Jerusalem?

865
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,202
What would take you
to that godforsaken place?

866
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:23,438
Jerusalem is not forsaken by God, Senator.

867
01:24:23,527 --> 01:24:25,563
You're a Jew.

868
01:24:25,647 --> 01:24:27,638
Well, certainly if you come
for the chariot racing,

869
01:24:27,727 --> 01:24:29,877
you will meet Octavius Messala.

870
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:31,286
I will live in hope.

871
01:24:38,767 --> 01:24:40,598
I will miss you, Judah.

872
01:24:52,607 --> 01:24:54,598
Farewell, Quintus Arrius.

873
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:00,441
I promise you

874
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:03,360
I will not disgrace the name you gave me.

875
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:08,118
But I will have my revenge.

876
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:10,163
No matter the cost.

877
01:25:56,447 --> 01:26:01,157
...and yet forgive them. Once? Seven times?

878
01:26:01,247 --> 01:26:03,317
No. Not once.

879
01:26:05,287 --> 01:26:07,118
Not seven times,

880
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:09,357
but 70 times seven.

881
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:13,599
We've heard it said,
"An eye for eye, a tooth for tooth."

882
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:17,805
I say to you,
do not fight those that wish to harm you.

883
01:26:17,887 --> 01:26:21,243
If someone hits your left cheek,
offer them the right.

884
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:25,083
If they ask for your tunic,
give them your cloak as well.

885
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:34,079
Forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

886
01:26:36,207 --> 01:26:38,926
For they know not what they do.
Forgive them.

887
01:26:49,447 --> 01:26:52,166
If they say, "Walk this mile with me,"

888
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:54,520
walk two miles.

889
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:56,563
As you've heard it said,

890
01:26:56,647 --> 01:26:59,559
"You should love your neighbour,
and hate your enemy."

891
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:03,037
But I say to you, love your enemies

892
01:27:03,127 --> 01:27:05,357
and bless those who curse you.

893
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:25,519
Please, can you help a leper?

894
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:47,803
Step back!

895
01:28:17,927 --> 01:28:19,679
You are under arrest!

896
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:24,484
You are under arrest!

897
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:41,204
Stay!

898
01:28:41,287 --> 01:28:42,322
Stay there.

899
01:29:38,847 --> 01:29:41,156
And what brings you
to this armpit of a country?

900
01:29:41,247 --> 01:29:42,566
I've come for the games.

901
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:49,038
Come. Empty your mind
of what troubles you.

902
01:29:49,447 --> 01:29:51,278
David.

903
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:52,561
- Esther.
- Leave me alone.

904
01:29:52,647 --> 01:29:54,603
What's happened to you?

905
01:29:55,247 --> 01:29:57,715
My sentence was life at the oars!

906
01:29:57,807 --> 01:29:59,638
When does Octavius Messala arrive?

907
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,604
Octavius Messala will be here?

908
01:30:01,687 --> 01:30:03,643
I told you your replacement was on his way.

909
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:07,683
My son has many good qualities,
but patience is not one of them.

910
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,045
Have some care there.

911
01:30:11,127 --> 01:30:12,321
So that is your son?

912
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,840
Yes, of course. You have not met.

913
01:30:13,927 --> 01:30:15,155
I will meet him tonight.

914
01:30:16,047 --> 01:30:18,766
What was it,
the name of the family you lived with?

915
01:30:18,847 --> 01:30:20,166
Who cares?

916
01:30:21,927 --> 01:30:23,326
Welcome, Marcellus.

917
01:30:23,407 --> 01:30:25,841
Most especially Octavius Messala.

918
01:30:25,927 --> 01:30:27,155
What's this game, Judah?

919
01:30:27,247 --> 01:30:29,397
This game is one that you will lose.

920
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:31,239
I should have had him crucified
as Pilate ordered!

921
01:30:31,327 --> 01:30:32,442
What stopped you?

922
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,085
I'll challenge him to race me in the games.

923
01:30:34,527 --> 01:30:35,516
Judah Ben Hur!

924
01:30:35,607 --> 01:30:37,563
I mean to see the light go out in your eyes.

925
01:30:37,647 --> 01:30:39,842
The race can be to the death
as easily as to the line.

926
01:30:39,927 --> 01:30:41,883
These damn games were not trouble enough.

927
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:44,435
It will only rouse the populace,
like this zealot in town.

928
01:30:44,527 --> 01:30:47,121
Wait until after the race and hand him over.

929
01:30:47,207 --> 01:30:49,721
- Forgive him.
- I have no forgiveness in me.

930
01:30:49,807 --> 01:30:51,126
And Judah Ben Hur.

931
01:30:51,207 --> 01:30:52,959
That is a bitter finish line indeed.

932
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,722
The knot is tied and cannot be undone
but with a cut.

933
01:33:29,349 --> 01:33:31,146
"To Octavius Messala.

934
01:33:31,229 --> 01:33:34,301
"You will leave Jerusalem
with the next military convoy to Caesarea."

935
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:36,061
We will race again.

936
01:33:37,629 --> 01:33:40,780
You know, we have Simonides arriving,
bringing you your bride.

937
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,860
Be you betrothed to me.

938
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:45,985
Messala is here.

939
01:33:46,069 --> 01:33:47,104
You can be of help to me, Judah.

940
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:49,145
Whose side are you on, Judah Ben Hur?

941
01:33:49,229 --> 01:33:51,299
It is not a question of sides.

942
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:54,540
We should be bringing Pilate
to the Garrison direct.

943
01:33:57,829 --> 01:33:59,148
Look out!

944
01:34:02,909 --> 01:34:03,944
Seize him!

945
01:34:07,829 --> 01:34:09,899
It was an accident! Judah!

946
01:34:10,949 --> 01:34:11,938
Get up!

947
01:34:13,909 --> 01:34:15,581
Crucify the man and garrotte the women.

948
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:17,660
- No! No!
- Hear me, Judah.

949
01:34:17,749 --> 01:34:20,343
You have destroyed the house of Hur
and me with it.

950
01:34:20,429 --> 01:34:21,908
Messala!

951
01:34:23,309 --> 01:34:27,143
You are now under the command
of Quintus Arrius.

952
01:34:27,869 --> 01:34:28,904
Silence!

953
01:34:28,989 --> 01:34:30,581
How long have you been at the oars?

954
01:34:30,669 --> 01:34:33,820
Almost three years.
I was betrayed by a friend.

955
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:35,786
That usually carries a maximum penalty.

956
01:34:36,469 --> 01:34:38,744
Three ships sighted. Pirates for sure.

957
01:34:38,829 --> 01:34:39,978
Battle stations!

958
01:34:42,829 --> 01:34:46,139
Back oars! Back oars!

959
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:55,627
If this is a Roman ship,
I will not let them take you back.

960
01:34:56,469 --> 01:34:58,380
But I must meet this fortunate young fellow.

961
01:34:58,469 --> 01:35:03,145
Emperor. I have the honour
of presenting to you my son, Sextus Arrius.

962
01:35:07,709 --> 01:35:10,177
Marcellus Agrippa. He has a son.

963
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:12,703
Octavius Messala. Do you know him?

964
01:35:12,789 --> 01:35:16,304
Farewell, Quintus Arrius.
I will not disgrace the name you gave me.

965
01:35:16,389 --> 01:35:19,301
But I will have my revenge.
No matter the cost.

966
01:35:48,029 --> 01:35:52,102
...and yet forgive them. Once? Seven times?

967
01:35:53,029 --> 01:35:55,020
No. Not once.

968
01:35:57,069 --> 01:35:59,060
Not seven times,

969
01:35:59,149 --> 01:36:00,821
but 70 times seven.

970
01:36:00,909 --> 01:36:05,505
We've heard it said,
"An eye for eye, a tooth for tooth."

971
01:36:05,589 --> 01:36:09,264
I say to you,
do not fight those that wish to harm you.

972
01:36:09,349 --> 01:36:13,024
If someone hits your left cheek,
offer them the right.

973
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:17,307
If they ask for your tunic,
give them your cloak as well.

974
01:36:22,789 --> 01:36:25,781
Forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

975
01:36:27,989 --> 01:36:32,028
For they know not what they do.
Forgive them.

976
01:36:34,549 --> 01:36:37,666
If they say, "Walk this mile with me..."

977
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:49,105
...walk two miles. As you've heard it said,

978
01:36:49,189 --> 01:36:52,022
"You should love your neighbour,
and hate your enemy."

979
01:36:52,109 --> 01:36:55,499
But I say to you, love your enemies

980
01:36:55,589 --> 01:36:57,784
and bless those who curse you.

981
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:17,466
Please, can you help a leper?

982
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:20,383
This way.

983
01:39:20,469 --> 01:39:24,223
I heard you've only just returned.
Where were you?

984
01:39:24,309 --> 01:39:27,585
Went outside the city to hear the Nazarene.

985
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:31,298
"Blessed are the weak.
The poor shall inherit the Earth."

986
01:39:32,189 --> 01:39:35,420
"Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God."

987
01:39:35,509 --> 01:39:38,626
I think that is wisdom.

988
01:39:38,709 --> 01:39:44,261
"The pure in heart." And who are they?
You'll not find many in 100, is all I know.

989
01:39:44,349 --> 01:39:47,659
Then you must try harder.

990
01:39:47,749 --> 01:39:52,777
Is that what I must do to win you, Esther?
Try harder?

991
01:39:54,549 --> 01:39:58,827
No. You must let me decide, David.

992
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:04,666
I would make the right decision,
for once made, it cannot be undone.

993
01:40:07,989 --> 01:40:10,298
I heard of your father's death.

994
01:40:10,389 --> 01:40:13,540
It was that of a true Roman
and an example to us all.

995
01:40:13,629 --> 01:40:17,065
- You must be proud of him.
- He has my undying respect.

996
01:40:19,869 --> 01:40:22,941
And what brings you
to this armpit of a country?

997
01:40:23,029 --> 01:40:25,907
- I've come for the games.
- Games.

998
01:40:25,989 --> 01:40:28,787
There are games of a sort.
Nothing like Rome.

999
01:40:28,869 --> 01:40:33,420
A chariot race with teams from all around.
Arabs, Syrians, Nubians.

1000
01:40:33,509 --> 01:40:37,263
This Garrison puts up a team
which always wins, if you call that sport.

1001
01:40:37,349 --> 01:40:40,307
It's enough to bring
Senator Marcellus Agrippa from Rome.

1002
01:40:40,389 --> 01:40:45,702
And little these Jews will thank him.
A fractious bunch of malcontents.

1003
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:49,987
There's one such abroad just now,
wandering the hills.

1004
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:54,824
They spring up like weeds,
and like weeds, we must cut them down.

1005
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:09,020
There was another set-to at the Joppa Gate.
Soldiers everywhere.

1006
01:41:09,109 --> 01:41:10,258
I mean, it's Passover.
They should know by now

1007
01:41:10,349 --> 01:41:13,307
the Romans are on the lookout for trouble.

1008
01:41:18,189 --> 01:41:21,579
Just telling Esther about the fighting.

1009
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:25,457
And you were not tempted to join in?

1010
01:41:25,549 --> 01:41:28,939
And where would you and your daughter be
if I was to join in and get myself arrested?

1011
01:41:29,029 --> 01:41:34,581
- We're indebted for your consideration.
- You're indebted for more than that.

1012
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:37,137
Who else do you know
would have the pair of you under his roof

1013
01:41:37,229 --> 01:41:38,457
after you lived with the lepers?

1014
01:41:38,549 --> 01:41:40,426
We were purified in accordance with the law.

1015
01:41:40,509 --> 01:41:42,420
- And who paid for that?
- And what did you pay with?

1016
01:41:42,509 --> 01:41:45,581
If not the proceeds
of the business Judah and I once owned.

1017
01:41:45,669 --> 01:41:49,059
Judah Ben Hur had you crucified
in his place.

1018
01:41:49,149 --> 01:41:52,027
- You do not know that.
- I know what I saw!

1019
01:41:52,109 --> 01:41:55,260
And I know I gave you both a home,
so let's have no more of your sarcasm

1020
01:41:55,349 --> 01:41:56,543
and your complaints.

1021
01:42:01,509 --> 01:42:07,141
You would be best to take heed.
I will not wait forever on you, Esther.

1022
01:42:09,669 --> 01:42:11,500
Daughter of Simonides.

1023
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:20,584
I'm sorry.
When I'm in pain, I speak without thought.

1024
01:42:20,669 --> 01:42:23,866
There's no need to apologise, Father.

1025
01:42:23,949 --> 01:42:26,861
You are welcome, but where will you stay?

1026
01:42:26,949 --> 01:42:30,703
The Senator's retinue will arrive soon,
and I must accommodate them.

1027
01:42:30,789 --> 01:42:32,586
Well, I saw a house across the way

1028
01:42:32,669 --> 01:42:36,378
closed by order of the governor for some
considerable time by the looks of it.

1029
01:42:36,469 --> 01:42:41,099
I know the place. It was a scene of an attack
on me when I first arrived four years ago.

1030
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:45,307
I had the perpetrators executed
and the house left empty as a warning.

1031
01:42:45,389 --> 01:42:48,665
Well, then it has served its purpose.
You've not been attacked since.

1032
01:42:48,749 --> 01:42:51,547
When I make an example,
I make an example.

1033
01:42:54,269 --> 01:42:57,067
Perhaps you might sell the house to me.

1034
01:42:57,149 --> 01:43:02,177
Well, it seemed a pleasing prospect
beneath the neglect and decay.

1035
01:43:03,349 --> 01:43:06,307
You want to buy a house here in Jerusalem?

1036
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:09,142
No doubt I will sell it at a profit later.

1037
01:43:09,229 --> 01:43:12,699
But you have no objection to benefiting
from my whim in the meantime, do you?

1038
01:43:12,789 --> 01:43:14,939
I suppose not.

1039
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:19,819
Well, then,
we shall consider it a mutual understanding.

1040
01:43:19,909 --> 01:43:21,137
Shall we say 50 talents?

1041
01:43:28,749 --> 01:43:29,738
All right.

1042
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:33,662
So, Governor, tell me,

1043
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:37,708
how much longer do you think
you'll be required to serve in this...

1044
01:43:37,789 --> 01:43:40,861
What did you call it? "Armpit of a country"?

1045
01:43:40,949 --> 01:43:43,224
Are you covetous of my position?

1046
01:43:45,549 --> 01:43:50,100
Because if you are, I could put in
a good word for you with the Emperor.

1047
01:43:56,509 --> 01:44:00,946
- How is your pain?
- It hurts only when I laugh.

1048
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:05,987
It's been a long time
since that last happened.

1049
01:44:06,069 --> 01:44:09,584
- We're alive, and we are together.
- Yes.

1050
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:24,461
Father, David is insistent
I give him an answer.

1051
01:44:25,789 --> 01:44:28,257
Even if it be no?

1052
01:44:28,349 --> 01:44:32,706
It cannot be no.
As I know he will turn us out.

1053
01:44:32,789 --> 01:44:35,861
- We will survive.
- Back with the lepers, begging at the caves?

1054
01:44:35,949 --> 01:44:38,747
- But you do not love this man.
- David knows that.

1055
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:42,139
I have no interest in what David knows.

1056
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:44,379
It is you, Esther.

1057
01:44:44,469 --> 01:44:46,380
Could you bear to marry
such a man as that?

1058
01:44:46,469 --> 01:44:48,027
And he has prospered.

1059
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:53,627
Forgotten his hatred of the Romans,
the hatred he used to vent on Judah.

1060
01:44:53,709 --> 01:44:56,940
On those who tried to live in good terms
with their conquerors.

1061
01:44:57,029 --> 01:44:59,543
Giving up his hatred
is not to be held against him.

1062
01:44:59,629 --> 01:45:03,417
He gave up nothing.
He just saw where his profit lay.

1063
01:45:03,509 --> 01:45:05,818
David Ben Levi has hatred enough
in his heart.

1064
01:45:05,909 --> 01:45:10,744
Then maybe I can erase that
by being a wife to him.

1065
01:45:12,349 --> 01:45:15,307
Do not overestimate
the power of love, Daughter.

1066
01:45:15,389 --> 01:45:17,778
It does not work miracles.

1067
01:45:45,829 --> 01:45:49,742
Saw all the work going on.
Thought I'd introduce myself.

1068
01:45:49,829 --> 01:45:51,308
David Ben Levi.

1069
01:45:51,389 --> 01:45:55,177
I have a business.
We do many things. Tiles, for one.

1070
01:45:55,269 --> 01:45:57,180
You need quite a few up there
by the look of it.

1071
01:45:57,269 --> 01:46:01,467
Yes, I believe you were here when one fell

1072
01:46:01,549 --> 01:46:03,665
some four years ago.

1073
01:46:05,029 --> 01:46:09,147
Judah. Judah Ben Hur.

1074
01:46:10,029 --> 01:46:13,180
- Sextus Arrius now.
- Sextus Arrius?

1075
01:46:13,269 --> 01:46:16,500
I have a Roman name for when it serves.

1076
01:46:16,589 --> 01:46:21,424
But I am who I ever was.
Judah, son of Jacob, of the house of Hur.

1077
01:46:22,469 --> 01:46:25,586
- What if you're discovered?
- I'm in no danger of discovery.

1078
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:29,264
I am a Roman citizen now
with all the benefits of that state.

1079
01:46:29,349 --> 01:46:31,340
Then it is true.

1080
01:46:31,429 --> 01:46:34,819
They said you were taken away,
protected by that friend of yours, Messala,

1081
01:46:34,909 --> 01:46:37,059
you and your mother and sister.

1082
01:46:37,149 --> 01:46:41,665
I have not seen them since that day.
You remember that day, David?

1083
01:46:41,749 --> 01:46:45,503
- Of course. I was there.
- I know.

1084
01:46:45,589 --> 01:46:49,662
I saw you when you stabbed a soldier.

1085
01:46:49,749 --> 01:46:53,025
- In self-defence.
- In the back.

1086
01:46:53,109 --> 01:46:58,706
An incident which turned into a riot,
for which my family was blamed.

1087
01:46:58,789 --> 01:47:02,702
I did not give your name when I was taken,

1088
01:47:02,789 --> 01:47:05,622
or else you would have joined Simonides
on the cross.

1089
01:47:05,709 --> 01:47:08,382
So you knew of that, then?

1090
01:47:08,469 --> 01:47:11,620
I saw him as I was being led away in chains.

1091
01:47:15,549 --> 01:47:18,188
His daughter, Esther.

1092
01:47:18,269 --> 01:47:20,578
What happened to her? Do you know?

1093
01:47:28,669 --> 01:47:29,704
No.

1094
01:47:44,229 --> 01:47:47,027
And now it is rumoured
I'm to release all common prisoners.

1095
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:49,942
In truth, I should be locking more up.

1096
01:47:50,029 --> 01:47:54,307
But the Senator must have his visit marked
by a gesture of magnanimity.

1097
01:47:54,389 --> 01:47:58,940
Do you know him?
Senator Marcellus Agrippa?

1098
01:47:59,029 --> 01:48:03,307
Indeed. He's never forgiven me
for having exposed his bastard son

1099
01:48:03,389 --> 01:48:06,665
as an incompetent
and sent off to learn his trade.

1100
01:48:06,749 --> 01:48:09,024
But enough of that.
How is your house coming along?

1101
01:48:10,469 --> 01:48:14,223
Lt'll be ready
to welcome the Senator and his son.

1102
01:48:14,309 --> 01:48:15,981
And yourself, Governor,
when the time comes.

1103
01:48:17,509 --> 01:48:20,387
So who will compete
in this great race, then?

1104
01:48:20,469 --> 01:48:22,983
Anyone who can fasten four horses
to a cart,

1105
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:25,663
and don't imagine
there'll be any shortage of them.

1106
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:30,220
All manner of rabble will mount up
for the chance to embarrass or injure Rome.

1107
01:48:30,309 --> 01:48:33,540
Ye gods and fishes,
how I hate this Passover.

1108
01:48:52,549 --> 01:48:54,460
So what's your answer?

1109
01:48:57,709 --> 01:49:01,827
I'm not a man you may play with in this way.

1110
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:04,298
I'm not a woman you may threaten.

1111
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:16,463
You've given my father and me
a roof over our heads.

1112
01:49:16,549 --> 01:49:19,825
For that, you have my gratitude.

1113
01:49:19,909 --> 01:49:22,423
But gratitude is not love, David.

1114
01:49:24,389 --> 01:49:26,107
And I do not love you as a wife should.

1115
01:49:26,189 --> 01:49:27,417
But I love you.

1116
01:49:29,629 --> 01:49:33,622
I love you enough for both of us,

1117
01:49:33,709 --> 01:49:35,700
and love will come.

1118
01:49:36,549 --> 01:49:38,699
And if it does not?

1119
01:49:41,669 --> 01:49:46,618
If you had my child,
your heart would warm to the father.

1120
01:49:46,709 --> 01:49:49,826
I know it.

1121
01:49:49,909 --> 01:49:52,548
You'd come to be all a wife should.

1122
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:55,826
You're not a woman
that does things by halves.

1123
01:49:57,309 --> 01:50:01,097
Take one step. The other will follow.

1124
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:09,747
Very well, then.

1125
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:13,907
I will marry you.

1126
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:13,703
I hope you will find
your quarters comfortable.

1127
01:51:13,789 --> 01:51:17,782
I do not use this place much.
I'm usually on the coast at Caesarea.

1128
01:51:17,869 --> 01:51:22,181
They will suffice. I am here only to oversee
the games in the Emperor's name.

1129
01:51:22,869 --> 01:51:28,705
He's adamant that by such displays,
Rome will be loved.

1130
01:51:28,789 --> 01:51:31,428
I think he'll find himself mistaken
in the case of these Jews.

1131
01:51:31,509 --> 01:51:35,184
You can explain that to him
when you are recalled to Rome.

1132
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:38,743
I've yet to see the Emperor's orders
under his seal.

1133
01:51:38,829 --> 01:51:39,818
You will have them. Never fear.

1134
01:51:39,909 --> 01:51:43,538
They're on their way,
carried by your replacement.

1135
01:51:46,309 --> 01:51:49,745
Sextus! Sextus Arrius!

1136
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:53,663
I saw you arrive.
And what a splendid sight it was.

1137
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:58,539
And you are the most agreeable prospect
I have seen since we left Rome.

1138
01:51:58,629 --> 01:52:01,587
So you were not in jest
about coming to this place.

1139
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:03,387
Sextus Arrius has bought a house here.

1140
01:52:03,469 --> 01:52:06,939
He seems to find Jerusalem
far more congenial than I do.

1141
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:09,224
I suggested he might consider relieving me.

1142
01:52:09,309 --> 01:52:12,699
I did not know
you had political ambitions, Sextus.

1143
01:52:12,789 --> 01:52:17,067
Whose magnificent horses
are these matched blacks?

1144
01:52:17,149 --> 01:52:19,504
They're my gift to the Emperor.

1145
01:52:19,589 --> 01:52:22,945
After they have triumphed at the games,
they will go to him for his stables.

1146
01:52:23,029 --> 01:52:27,864
- When does Octavius Messala arrive?
- Octavius Messala will be here?

1147
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:30,861
I told you your replacement was on his way.

1148
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:37,941
Let's hope his entrance
is better than his last.

1149
01:52:38,029 --> 01:52:41,339
If you will excuse me,
there is much I must attend to.

1150
01:52:43,989 --> 01:52:45,661
What a popinjay.

1151
01:52:47,309 --> 01:52:49,664
I marvel that he has lasted as long as he has.

1152
01:52:49,749 --> 01:52:52,263
So you've bought a house here?

1153
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:55,625
I should have thought that your estates
in Umbria surpassed by far

1154
01:52:55,709 --> 01:52:57,779
anything that you might find in this land.

1155
01:52:57,869 --> 01:53:02,021
I once lived here a long time ago.

1156
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:04,384
As did your son if I'm not mistaken.

1157
01:53:04,469 --> 01:53:06,744
Until I brought him to Rome.

1158
01:53:06,829 --> 01:53:09,627
And his life truly began.

1159
01:53:09,709 --> 01:53:15,898
It'll be interesting for him to return,
I imagine, to the scene of former triumphs.

1160
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,344
When can we visit you in your new house?

1161
01:53:18,429 --> 01:53:23,947
I plan a banquet to celebrate you all
being here as soon as Messala arrives.

1162
01:53:24,029 --> 01:53:27,783
Well, I will leave you to recover
from your journey.

1163
01:53:32,669 --> 01:53:37,618
What is that man doing here?
I do not trust him. Upstart.

1164
01:53:39,429 --> 01:53:42,705
Perhaps you should let me ask him.

1165
01:53:42,789 --> 01:53:45,428
Or are you saving me for your son?

1166
01:53:49,109 --> 01:53:53,341
Very well.
A slice from a cut loaf is never missed.

1167
01:54:09,949 --> 01:54:14,420
- Tell your master Sextus Arrius is here.
- And to what do I owe this honour?

1168
01:54:14,509 --> 01:54:16,943
You spoke of repairs to my house.

1169
01:54:17,989 --> 01:54:20,947
- And you're offering the work?
- Or you would prefer I went elsewhere?

1170
01:54:21,029 --> 01:54:23,907
I can't supply your needs. I'm sorry.

1171
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:28,585
You were at the house
only days ago, soliciting.

1172
01:54:28,669 --> 01:54:31,627
What did you lose interest in profit
when you discovered I was not a Roman?

1173
01:54:31,709 --> 01:54:35,748
- I said I can't help you.
- David! David!

1174
01:54:46,309 --> 01:54:49,540
- That woman! Stop her!
- Stay there!

1175
01:54:49,629 --> 01:54:50,857
Esther, thank God you're alive.

1176
01:54:50,949 --> 01:54:54,624
I asked David if he knew where you were,
and he told me he didn't.

1177
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:56,347
- That will be all.
- Thanks, sir.

1178
01:54:56,429 --> 01:54:59,546
- Why did you run?
- Do not touch me.

1179
01:54:59,629 --> 01:55:01,779
If you must detain me, have them do it.

1180
01:55:01,869 --> 01:55:07,387
Esther, wait. What's the matter?
What's happened to you?

1181
01:55:10,589 --> 01:55:14,901
- Esther!
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone!

1182
01:55:19,989 --> 01:55:24,460
Why did you spit on me?
What have I done that you spit on me?

1183
01:55:24,549 --> 01:55:27,461
Why would I not spit on someone
who bargained my father's life for his own?

1184
01:55:27,549 --> 01:55:30,382
I had nothing to do with your father's death!

1185
01:55:30,469 --> 01:55:34,018
Then how is it that you are a Roman,
and he is a cripple?

1186
01:55:35,829 --> 01:55:39,026
- Simonides is not dead?
- No thanks to you.

1187
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:41,179
He was crucified on the eve of the Sabbath,

1188
01:55:41,269 --> 01:55:43,464
and they took him down at sunset
before he died.

1189
01:55:43,549 --> 01:55:46,939
Or am I to be grateful
that you Romans allow us these privileges?

1190
01:55:48,829 --> 01:55:52,947
I saw him as I was being taken to the galley
in chains.

1191
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:56,226
My sentence was life at the oars!

1192
01:55:58,909 --> 01:56:02,345
You seem to have rowed your way
to freedom.

1193
01:56:03,789 --> 01:56:07,987
You once professed to know what was
in men's souls by looking into their eyes.

1194
01:56:10,029 --> 01:56:11,826
Look into mine.

1195
01:56:16,189 --> 01:56:18,100
I had no part in it.

1196
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:22,859
If you don't believe that,
then you can believe what you will.

1197
01:56:47,389 --> 01:56:47,429
He denied his part in your crucifixion,
of course. Said he had nothing to do with it.

1198
01:56:47,429 --> 01:56:50,819
He denied his part in your crucifixion,
of course. Said he had nothing to do with it.

1199
01:56:50,909 --> 01:56:53,503
- And you did not believe him?
- He is a Roman, father.

1200
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:58,709
Soldiers obey him. Even looks different.
He is not the Judah Ben Hur I knew.

1201
01:56:58,789 --> 01:57:00,302
And to whom you are betrothed.

1202
01:57:00,389 --> 01:57:03,984
- All that is in the past.
- But he is here, now.

1203
01:57:04,069 --> 01:57:06,458
How is it that someone
sentenced to the galleys for life

1204
01:57:06,549 --> 01:57:08,426
is now wealthy enough
to buy back his old home?

1205
01:57:08,509 --> 01:57:12,388
Unless, of course,
he was protected by his friend, Messala.

1206
01:57:13,469 --> 01:57:16,939
- Did you look into his eyes, daughter?
- Yes.

1207
01:57:17,029 --> 01:57:18,621
And?

1208
01:57:18,709 --> 01:57:20,461
Could not see out of my own.

1209
01:57:23,069 --> 01:57:24,627
I must speak with him.

1210
01:57:27,829 --> 01:57:30,548
Do you think he will confess to you
what he denied to me?

1211
01:57:32,549 --> 01:57:36,337
Perhaps my eyes will see clearer than yours.

1212
01:57:39,829 --> 01:57:42,423
Esther, it's me.

1213
01:57:42,509 --> 01:57:46,263
- What do you want?
- I want to see Esther! Open the door.

1214
01:57:46,349 --> 01:57:49,978
- This is not the time.
- I say open the door, you will open it.

1215
01:57:50,069 --> 01:57:54,745
This is my house!
You and she live here at my sufferance!

1216
01:57:55,789 --> 01:58:01,022
- What do you want?
- To see you. That you were safe.

1217
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:04,306
I am safe. What else?

1218
01:58:05,789 --> 01:58:07,825
Do I still have your word?

1219
01:58:35,549 --> 01:58:40,669
You give short measure now that
the business is yours, David Ben Levi.

1220
01:58:40,749 --> 01:58:42,467
I've had no complaints
from those I deal with.

1221
01:58:42,549 --> 01:58:44,028
The Romans?

1222
01:58:44,109 --> 01:58:46,828
Those whom you swore to resist
and drive out?

1223
01:58:46,909 --> 01:58:51,778
Have a care, Sextus Arrius,
that I do not reveal you for what you are.

1224
01:58:51,869 --> 01:58:54,099
And what am I?

1225
01:58:54,189 --> 01:58:59,582
An imposter, a traitor,
one who bartered another's life for his own.

1226
01:59:26,829 --> 01:59:30,708
Will we go to Pontius Pilate,
and you can tell him your lies,

1227
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:34,498
and I will tell him mine,
and we will see who is believed?

1228
01:59:36,869 --> 01:59:40,305
This man once worked for me.

1229
01:59:41,309 --> 01:59:44,858
I and my family were ruined
by his actions against Rome.

1230
01:59:46,469 --> 01:59:50,747
He is a liar, and a coward, and a hypocrite.

1231
01:59:58,029 --> 01:59:59,860
And he still stabs from behind.

1232
02:00:18,029 --> 02:00:23,820
It is one thing, a man's heart not being in it,
but when his body is equally absent...

1233
02:00:26,389 --> 02:00:28,380
What ails my beloved?

1234
02:00:32,789 --> 02:00:34,586
Do whores have beloveds?

1235
02:00:35,829 --> 02:00:39,105
The whore's heart longs
for un-bought kisses.

1236
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:54,664
Marcellus is curious as to why you are here.

1237
02:00:54,749 --> 02:00:56,546
And he sent you to find out?

1238
02:00:59,869 --> 02:01:03,339
This is so you know
I am not trying to poison you.

1239
02:01:03,429 --> 02:01:07,422
Yes, he sent me to find out,
but you have told me nothing.

1240
02:01:09,789 --> 02:01:13,384
You have poisoned at his command?

1241
02:01:13,469 --> 02:01:19,226
I have indisposed a few in my time,
but I save the best for myself.

1242
02:01:20,669 --> 02:01:23,945
For when I have had enough
of this monstrous world.

1243
02:01:26,309 --> 02:01:31,986
But your secret is safe with me, Judah,

1244
02:01:33,429 --> 02:01:35,738
if you were to share it with me.

1245
02:01:40,429 --> 02:01:45,298
Come to where there are no lies,
no secrets, no words.

1246
02:01:46,509 --> 02:01:49,307
Empty your mind of what troubles you,

1247
02:01:50,949 --> 02:01:55,306
of why you are here and what you must do.

1248
02:01:55,389 --> 02:01:57,778
We are here to see Judah Ben Hur.

1249
02:02:34,709 --> 02:02:37,018
- Stay here.
- It's my pleasure.

1250
02:02:46,469 --> 02:02:47,458
Simonides.

1251
02:02:59,749 --> 02:03:01,421
Simonides.

1252
02:03:04,589 --> 02:03:08,423
Judah, God's blessing on you.

1253
02:03:11,229 --> 02:03:12,708
Simonides, you must believe me.

1254
02:03:16,909 --> 02:03:17,898
I believe you.

1255
02:03:31,349 --> 02:03:34,500
Daughter, come.

1256
02:03:36,469 --> 02:03:38,027
Look in his eyes.

1257
02:03:47,109 --> 02:03:48,906
Look and see.

1258
02:04:09,869 --> 02:04:14,181
The curfew will begin shortly.
I will find you an escort.

1259
02:04:16,109 --> 02:04:18,384
I have permission to stay out all night.

1260
02:04:20,829 --> 02:04:22,057
It is better that you return.

1261
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:26,308
You have found a replacement?

1262
02:04:26,389 --> 02:04:29,142
I saw the girl and how you were with her.

1263
02:04:29,229 --> 02:04:33,017
She and her father
were once friends of my family.

1264
02:04:33,109 --> 02:04:37,864
I thought they were members of it
from the warmth of your greeting.

1265
02:04:38,869 --> 02:04:41,303
But perhaps she was something more.

1266
02:04:43,749 --> 02:04:47,788
I met Esther once before in my life,

1267
02:04:47,869 --> 02:04:51,384
and she was but a child.

1268
02:04:51,469 --> 02:04:53,824
Well, she's a child no longer.

1269
02:04:59,389 --> 02:05:02,779
I wish you joy of her.

1270
02:05:02,869 --> 02:05:05,622
You and I are more alike than you suppose.

1271
02:05:05,709 --> 02:05:09,588
We make our way in this world by our wits.

1272
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:14,345
You should trust me,
Sextus Arrius or Judah Ben Hur.

1273
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:17,181
Whoever you are.

1274
02:06:07,909 --> 02:06:11,026
- Left, right, left, right...
- The decree recalling Pilate is in that scroll.

1275
02:06:11,109 --> 02:06:14,260
Do not present it until these games
and the Passover have concluded.

1276
02:06:14,349 --> 02:06:15,702
Let that be Pilate's last duty.

1277
02:06:15,789 --> 02:06:19,907
The other is the edict authorising
the release of prisoners for the festival.

1278
02:06:19,989 --> 02:06:23,061
- He can have that now.
- How was the Emperor when you left him?

1279
02:06:23,149 --> 02:06:25,902
He's grown over-reliant on his commander
of the Praetorian Guard.

1280
02:06:25,989 --> 02:06:28,219
Sejanus, he's a dangerous man.

1281
02:06:28,309 --> 02:06:30,186
He needs to be the gate
through which all must enter.

1282
02:06:30,269 --> 02:06:33,102
It's no bad thing that the Emperor
grows used to such a gatekeeper.

1283
02:06:33,189 --> 02:06:36,386
Then he will not notice it so much
when one is replaced by another.

1284
02:06:36,469 --> 02:06:39,779
And how long will that be?
I don't mean to spend my whole life here.

1285
02:06:39,869 --> 02:06:41,700
Did you not live here
when you were younger?

1286
02:06:41,789 --> 02:06:48,262
- Exactly, so I know whereof I speak.
- We must have patience.

1287
02:06:48,349 --> 02:06:51,625
It would be as well
if you applied yourself here.

1288
02:06:51,709 --> 02:06:56,624
It would help your reputation
should some outbreak need putting down

1289
02:06:56,709 --> 02:06:58,142
to show Rome she has a man of action.

1290
02:06:58,229 --> 02:07:01,107
I'm sure an outbreak can be both raised up
and put down with great ease.

1291
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:03,987
There was talk of some King of the Jews
proclaiming himself

1292
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:05,138
as we came in from the coast.

1293
02:07:05,229 --> 02:07:08,824
I had forgotten
what a barbarous people they are.

1294
02:07:08,909 --> 02:07:14,461
Gaius Antonius. This is Octavius Messala,
come from Rome with the Emperor's orders.

1295
02:07:14,549 --> 02:07:16,824
Messala and I are acquainted.

1296
02:07:18,029 --> 02:07:19,940
- Still here, Gaius?
- Yes.

1297
02:07:20,029 --> 02:07:23,863
I congratulate you on your successes
in foreign lands.

1298
02:07:25,429 --> 02:07:30,298
That's an order from the Emperor requiring
the release of all prisoners for the festival.

1299
02:07:30,389 --> 02:07:33,506
The locals will not thank us for dumping
murderers and the diseased into their midst.

1300
02:07:33,589 --> 02:07:35,307
Pilate will not be pleased.

1301
02:07:35,389 --> 02:07:38,506
Pilate will not have much longer
to be pleased or displeased.

1302
02:07:38,589 --> 02:07:42,662
Octavius Messala will replace him
when the festival is over.

1303
02:07:43,749 --> 02:07:45,262
So you managed it.

1304
02:07:45,349 --> 02:07:47,465
I did not give much for your chances
after the last time.

1305
02:07:47,549 --> 02:07:51,428
- You know that was no fault of mine.
- You were Garrison Commander as I recall.

1306
02:07:51,509 --> 02:07:55,343
Do not make an enemy of me
before it is necessary, Gaius.

1307
02:07:55,429 --> 02:07:57,465
Let there be no talk of enemies.

1308
02:07:57,549 --> 02:08:00,461
Gaius Antonius will be our champion
in the chariot race.

1309
02:08:00,549 --> 02:08:05,862
He will ride the Emperor's four to victory,
and we will all rejoice in it.

1310
02:08:05,949 --> 02:08:09,988
Indeed. I've heard of the famous four.

1311
02:08:10,069 --> 02:08:14,824
Perhaps you'll indulge me, allow me
to complete a circuit or two behind them?

1312
02:08:14,909 --> 02:08:17,184
It is never a good idea
to confuse such thoroughbreds

1313
02:08:17,269 --> 02:08:19,260
with different drivers before a race.

1314
02:08:19,349 --> 02:08:21,579
I do not think
you need overly concern yourself, Gaius.

1315
02:08:21,669 --> 02:08:25,981
There are no animals comparable to these
in all Judea.

1316
02:08:26,069 --> 02:08:29,823
Then you have not seen
Sheikh llderim's team. Senator.

1317
02:09:12,229 --> 02:09:14,106
Cannot that young fool control himself?

1318
02:09:14,189 --> 02:09:16,100
There's no point
in offending Gaius Antonius

1319
02:09:16,189 --> 02:09:17,224
before he's even taken office.

1320
02:09:22,949 --> 02:09:25,861
My dear Gaius, forgive him.

1321
02:09:28,589 --> 02:09:32,138
My son has many good qualities,
but patience is not one of them.

1322
02:09:38,549 --> 02:09:40,301
Have some care there.

1323
02:09:40,389 --> 02:09:42,857
Nor his concern for the horses
if that's how he begins.

1324
02:09:42,949 --> 02:09:47,898
I fear he learnt his charioteering in war
not in the circus.

1325
02:09:49,789 --> 02:09:52,861
Splendid animals. They belong to you?

1326
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:59,019
My name is Judah Ben Hur.

1327
02:10:00,509 --> 02:10:04,661
- I knew a Ben Hur. Jacob.
- He was my father.

1328
02:10:06,709 --> 02:10:10,384
He was spoken well of for a Jew.

1329
02:10:10,469 --> 02:10:13,222
That is all a Jew can ask.

1330
02:10:13,309 --> 02:10:18,303
So what is the son of Jacob Ben Hur
doing dressed as a Roman?

1331
02:10:18,389 --> 02:10:21,461
Has he forsaken his faith
and his people entirely?

1332
02:10:21,629 --> 02:10:23,620
Not entirely.

1333
02:10:23,709 --> 02:10:28,339
But among the Romans,
I'm known as Sextus Arrius.

1334
02:10:29,349 --> 02:10:32,022
Ilderim, Sheikh of the Howeitat.

1335
02:10:32,109 --> 02:10:35,419
Sextus Arrius.
You are studying the form then.

1336
02:10:35,509 --> 02:10:37,420
Indeed.

1337
02:10:37,509 --> 02:10:42,583
I have a fancy for Sheikh llderim's four.
Are they not magnificent?

1338
02:10:44,469 --> 02:10:48,144
You are Sheikh Ilderim.
I'd heard you would be here.

1339
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:51,107
Perhaps we can have a wager
on the outcome?

1340
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:52,668
- Perhaps.
- Come now, Sheikh.

1341
02:10:52,749 --> 02:10:54,546
Are not your steeds famous
throughout the East?

1342
02:10:54,629 --> 02:10:59,623
- Even in Rome we have heard of them.
- I will venture a sum on the Sheikh's four.

1343
02:11:01,469 --> 02:11:04,700
We are beginning to see your true colours,
then, now that you've come home.

1344
02:11:04,789 --> 02:11:08,304
Just to add a little spice
to the event, Senator.

1345
02:11:08,389 --> 02:11:11,267
I will be happy to take your money, Sextus.

1346
02:11:14,949 --> 02:11:16,098
So that is your son.

1347
02:11:16,189 --> 02:11:18,419
Yes, of course. You have not met.

1348
02:11:18,509 --> 02:11:20,227
Let me call him in.

1349
02:11:20,309 --> 02:11:22,743
It's time he gave the reins back to Gaius.

1350
02:11:22,829 --> 02:11:25,059
I will meet him tonight.

1351
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:27,219
Do not spoil his gallop.

1352
02:11:28,429 --> 02:11:31,102
You will find my house easily,
but should you have any difficulty,

1353
02:11:31,189 --> 02:11:33,783
ask the way to the Hur house.

1354
02:11:33,869 --> 02:11:37,225
Octavius Messala may even know it
from his time spent in Jerusalem.

1355
02:11:37,309 --> 02:11:40,301
A well-known Jewish family lived there then.

1356
02:11:53,709 --> 02:11:56,860
They're splendid.
Far too good for an emperor.

1357
02:11:56,949 --> 02:11:58,667
Certainly one who'll never ride them.

1358
02:11:58,749 --> 02:12:02,662
We're going to the house
of Sextus Arrius tonight.

1359
02:12:02,749 --> 02:12:04,705
I told you of him, did I not?

1360
02:12:04,789 --> 02:12:07,098
He was the slave adopted by Quintas Arrius,

1361
02:12:07,189 --> 02:12:12,627
who then conveniently died
and left him his name and fortune.

1362
02:12:12,709 --> 02:12:16,338
Almost as good
as being the illegitimate son of a senator.

1363
02:12:28,469 --> 02:12:30,903
Would you like some bread?

1364
02:12:32,429 --> 02:12:33,418
Here you go.

1365
02:12:36,469 --> 02:12:37,948
For you.

1366
02:12:41,989 --> 02:12:43,820
Some bread for you.

1367
02:12:44,829 --> 02:12:46,342
For you.

1368
02:12:49,149 --> 02:12:51,185
Would you like some bread?

1369
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:14,780
- How long have you been his whore?
- He bought me when I was 13.

1370
02:13:17,829 --> 02:13:24,268
My mother was 12 when he bought her
from her father at a fair price, he told me,

1371
02:13:24,349 --> 02:13:28,103
just so I wouldn't think
I was the bastard of a bargain.

1372
02:13:28,189 --> 02:13:31,340
- She's dead, your mother?
- Buried just outside the city.

1373
02:13:31,429 --> 02:13:33,738
The Jews wouldn't let her be with them.
She wasn't a Roman,

1374
02:13:33,829 --> 02:13:37,617
so they put her in a field somewhere.

1375
02:13:39,829 --> 02:13:41,228
How old were you when she died?

1376
02:13:41,309 --> 02:13:43,265
A little older than she was
when she was sold.

1377
02:13:47,829 --> 02:13:50,866
So where did you live?

1378
02:13:52,829 --> 02:13:55,104
Until he sent for me,
with some Jews in Jerusalem

1379
02:13:55,189 --> 02:13:57,498
for almost five years.

1380
02:14:01,469 --> 02:14:03,425
Do they still live here?

1381
02:14:05,469 --> 02:14:06,948
No, they're gone.

1382
02:14:09,549 --> 02:14:12,268
Do you remember their name?

1383
02:14:15,549 --> 02:14:20,543
What was it,
the name of the family you lived with?

1384
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:22,699
Who cares?

1385
02:14:50,709 --> 02:14:54,384
- What's wrong, Messala?
- What's this? Why are we here?

1386
02:14:54,469 --> 02:14:56,903
This is where Sextus Arrius lives.

1387
02:15:10,349 --> 02:15:12,817
Welcome, Marcellus, Athene,

1388
02:15:15,429 --> 02:15:18,023
most especially Octavius Messala.

1389
02:15:21,909 --> 02:15:24,218
You remember this game, don't you?

1390
02:15:24,309 --> 02:15:28,666
The trick is to expect it to fall
at every moment.

1391
02:15:31,509 --> 02:15:34,467
I thought you did not know
Octavius Messala.

1392
02:15:34,549 --> 02:15:38,303
I knew him once. When we were boys,
we were one another's best.

1393
02:15:39,509 --> 02:15:41,500
He lived with us after his mother died.

1394
02:15:42,949 --> 02:15:46,862
With my mother, Ruth, and my sister, Tirzah.

1395
02:15:48,109 --> 02:15:51,260
We were a family, were we not, Messala?

1396
02:15:52,389 --> 02:15:53,663
What's this game, Judah?

1397
02:15:53,749 --> 02:15:56,582
This game is one that you will lose.

1398
02:15:57,629 --> 02:16:00,302
What is this? Who is this man?

1399
02:16:00,389 --> 02:16:04,268
Tell him who I am, Messala,
and do not be modest about your part.

1400
02:16:09,349 --> 02:16:10,418
Messala?

1401
02:16:21,549 --> 02:16:25,098
Get out of the city, criminals.
Thank the new governor.

1402
02:16:27,869 --> 02:16:28,938
Filthy leper!

1403
02:16:47,629 --> 02:16:50,860
What is going on here? I demand to know.

1404
02:16:50,949 --> 02:16:54,259
Your son condemned me to death,

1405
02:16:55,509 --> 02:16:58,103
crucified my friend,

1406
02:16:58,189 --> 02:17:01,340
and murdered my mother and my sister

1407
02:17:02,749 --> 02:17:05,343
all to protect his own position.

1408
02:17:06,589 --> 02:17:10,025
And I am here to have my revenge.

1409
02:17:10,109 --> 02:17:12,145
Would any Roman do other?

1410
02:17:13,469 --> 02:17:16,029
Sextus Arrius is the same man
you sent to the galleys?

1411
02:17:16,109 --> 02:17:17,701
I should have had him crucified
as Pilate ordered!

1412
02:17:17,789 --> 02:17:19,461
What stopped you?

1413
02:17:21,829 --> 02:17:23,547
A qualm of conscience.

1414
02:17:23,629 --> 02:17:27,144
Did he not share his home,
the fellowship of his family?

1415
02:17:27,229 --> 02:17:29,868
Even you, Marcellus, might have paused.

1416
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:36,147
- I'll have no qualms of conscience this time.
- He is a citizen of Rome, and a rich one.

1417
02:17:36,869 --> 02:17:39,303
You think you can order him executed
or sent into slavery?

1418
02:17:39,389 --> 02:17:42,859
- I'll challenge him to combat.
- I have seen this man in combat.

1419
02:17:42,949 --> 02:17:44,826
He killed the Thracian you sent to me.

1420
02:17:44,909 --> 02:17:47,946
I don't care how many Thracians he's killed.
I'll meet him. One of us will die.

1421
02:17:48,029 --> 02:17:52,864
There's more than one way to skin this cat
than by combat.

1422
02:17:52,949 --> 02:17:56,100
Let Athene tincture his wine.

1423
02:17:56,189 --> 02:17:59,147
You think I'd have him poisoned
by a whore?

1424
02:18:01,389 --> 02:18:02,947
I'll challenge him to race me in the games.

1425
02:18:03,029 --> 02:18:05,862
You do not have a team.

1426
02:18:05,949 --> 02:18:08,782
Let Athene use her skills
to indispose Gaius Antonius.

1427
02:18:08,869 --> 02:18:11,099
I'll take the Emperor's four.

1428
02:18:11,189 --> 02:18:14,340
It will be as we said when we were youths.

1429
02:18:14,429 --> 02:18:19,025
We dreamed then of competing
in a chariot race before a great crowd

1430
02:18:19,109 --> 02:18:22,738
with laurels to the victor,
and death to the loser.

1431
02:18:31,189 --> 02:18:34,340
So it was for revenge that you returned.

1432
02:18:34,429 --> 02:18:37,387
Not to search for your family.

1433
02:18:37,469 --> 02:18:38,902
Esther, they are dead.

1434
02:18:40,189 --> 02:18:44,148
I believed your father dead
and you lost to me forever.

1435
02:18:44,229 --> 02:18:47,027
Yes, I came back for revenge.

1436
02:18:49,829 --> 02:18:53,265
And when you have it, what then?

1437
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:57,422
- Lf you do not die attempting it.
- Then it will be done,

1438
02:18:57,509 --> 02:19:00,421
and I will leave this prison I have lived in
for four years.

1439
02:19:00,509 --> 02:19:02,579
And will you be free then?

1440
02:19:05,109 --> 02:19:08,306
Will Ruth and Tirzah be alive,
or my father live without pain?

1441
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:12,177
Esther, the knot is tied
and cannot be undone but with a cut.

1442
02:19:13,589 --> 02:19:15,500
Do not be afraid.

1443
02:19:15,589 --> 02:19:19,218
I have provided for Simonides and yourself.

1444
02:19:21,149 --> 02:19:24,061
No matter what happens.

1445
02:19:24,149 --> 02:19:27,903
I would rather beg
than have such a promise made to me.

1446
02:19:27,989 --> 02:19:32,187
It would make me part of your madness,
Judah, and do not tell me you are not mad.

1447
02:19:32,269 --> 02:19:35,944
I've seen it, and I've heard it.

1448
02:20:11,869 --> 02:20:17,978
- He drives like a soldier.
- Well, that is what he is, Gaius Antonius.

1449
02:20:18,069 --> 02:20:19,184
Well, this is not a war.

1450
02:20:23,229 --> 02:20:28,542
- Senator, please, I fear for the horses.
- You're right. He drives them too hard.

1451
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:31,189
Drink up, Gaius. I will call him in.

1452
02:20:40,549 --> 02:20:42,426
I have food for you.

1453
02:20:43,229 --> 02:20:44,503
I am unclean.

1454
02:20:45,989 --> 02:20:48,947
Take it. Please.

1455
02:20:50,389 --> 02:20:53,586
- You've been newly freed?
- After four long years.

1456
02:20:56,629 --> 02:21:00,258
Next time, I'll bring you clean clothes.

1457
02:21:00,349 --> 02:21:03,944
- I am with my mother.
- I'll bring something for her also.

1458
02:21:06,229 --> 02:21:07,264
Thank you.

1459
02:21:07,349 --> 02:21:10,625
- Where is your mother?
- She is ashamed to be seen.

1460
02:21:10,709 --> 02:21:14,463
No, it is no shame. Only misfortune.

1461
02:21:21,109 --> 02:21:22,144
Tirzah?

1462
02:21:23,909 --> 02:21:26,469
Tirzah! It is me, Esther!

1463
02:21:28,189 --> 02:21:29,417
Tirzah?

1464
02:21:30,669 --> 02:21:32,660
Tirzah, is Ruth here?

1465
02:21:39,669 --> 02:21:41,625
We are not clean.

1466
02:21:41,709 --> 02:21:45,384
God be praised. You're both alive.

1467
02:21:45,469 --> 02:21:49,428
- Would that it were not so.
- No, Ruth, don't say that.

1468
02:21:49,509 --> 02:21:53,582
I've seen Judah.
He is also alive, and he's here in Jerusalem.

1469
02:22:13,909 --> 02:22:15,945
How long will it take?

1470
02:22:16,029 --> 02:22:19,180
He will be unwell today and worse tomorrow.

1471
02:22:19,269 --> 02:22:20,861
Will he die?

1472
02:22:22,149 --> 02:22:26,267
- What did you use on him?
- Powdered glass. It will wash out.

1473
02:22:27,869 --> 02:22:30,622
But the danger is
if he falls into the hands of physicians,

1474
02:22:30,709 --> 02:22:32,859
they will purge him and make things worse.

1475
02:22:33,389 --> 02:22:35,857
You're a dangerous woman, Athene.

1476
02:22:37,069 --> 02:22:40,186
How else could I have survived
in a world of dangerous men?

1477
02:22:43,629 --> 02:22:47,338
- To think of seeing Judah once more.
- He must not know.

1478
02:22:48,829 --> 02:22:52,424
- What do you mean?
- You can't tell him you've seen us.

1479
02:22:52,509 --> 02:22:53,908
He mustn't know we're like this.

1480
02:22:53,989 --> 02:22:59,302
- Mother, Judah is alive. He's here.
- And God be praised for it.

1481
02:22:59,389 --> 02:23:03,507
But would you have him ruin his life forever
by revealing our plight to him?

1482
02:23:03,589 --> 02:23:06,103
Judah believes we're dead.

1483
02:23:07,029 --> 02:23:11,420
Let us be a memory to him,
not a living nightmare.

1484
02:23:11,509 --> 02:23:15,468
But how could I not?
How could I not in all my life?

1485
02:23:15,549 --> 02:23:17,824
- How could I not speak of it?
- Promise me.

1486
02:23:20,109 --> 02:23:21,303
Promise me, Esther.

1487
02:23:22,709 --> 02:23:24,984
I ask this not for myself, not for Tirzah,

1488
02:23:26,429 --> 02:23:29,546
but for my son.

1489
02:23:31,469 --> 02:23:35,018
For him. Promise me.

1490
02:23:38,749 --> 02:23:42,059
Judah! Judah Ben Hur!

1491
02:23:43,669 --> 02:23:46,467
Judah, you must forgive me.
I left so hurriedly last night.

1492
02:23:46,549 --> 02:23:48,983
You had me at a disadvantage.
That won't happen again.

1493
02:23:49,069 --> 02:23:50,946
- Speak your piece.
- What's your desire?

1494
02:23:51,029 --> 02:23:55,864
- To see you dead by my own hand.
- Spoken like a Roman.

1495
02:23:55,949 --> 02:23:58,543
I'll meet you on the track.
Find yourself a team. We'll settle it there.

1496
02:23:58,629 --> 02:24:01,348
I have not come to win a chariot race.

1497
02:24:01,429 --> 02:24:04,466
I mean to see the light go out in your eyes.

1498
02:24:04,549 --> 02:24:07,825
A race can be to the death
as easily as to the line.

1499
02:24:07,909 --> 02:24:11,504
- So be it.
- Good. It will be like old times.

1500
02:24:55,669 --> 02:24:58,706
Forgive my uninvited presence,
Sheikh llderim.

1501
02:24:58,789 --> 02:25:01,098
Do you remember me? I am Judah Ben Hur.

1502
02:25:03,229 --> 02:25:06,380
Those who come in peace
are always welcome.

1503
02:25:07,629 --> 02:25:08,744
Sit.

1504
02:25:15,189 --> 02:25:19,023
So what do you want of me,
Judah, son of Jacob?

1505
02:25:20,229 --> 02:25:22,982
To drive your chariot in the games.

1506
02:25:24,589 --> 02:25:26,944
I already have a charioteer.

1507
02:25:27,029 --> 02:25:30,021
I am willing to pay well to take his place.
Name your price.

1508
02:25:31,749 --> 02:25:33,819
Why this urgency?

1509
02:25:33,909 --> 02:25:37,584
You made no mention of it
when we met before.

1510
02:25:37,669 --> 02:25:40,502
It is a matter between
one Octavius Messala and myself.

1511
02:25:41,629 --> 02:25:45,338
The madman who will soon rule over us.

1512
02:25:45,429 --> 02:25:48,899
So you wish to compete against him
in this race?

1513
02:25:50,829 --> 02:25:54,742
This will not be a race.
It is a contest to the death.

1514
02:25:54,829 --> 02:25:57,263
To the death?

1515
02:25:57,349 --> 02:26:00,261
That is a bitter finish line, indeed.

1516
02:26:00,349 --> 02:26:01,668
If I were to explain myself...

1517
02:26:01,749 --> 02:26:05,378
Before you begin,
it is not my decision to make.

1518
02:26:05,469 --> 02:26:08,302
I thought that Sheikh llderim
was sovereign in his own house.

1519
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:10,744
In such matters,
there are others who are more important.

1520
02:26:10,829 --> 02:26:13,548
It is they you must persuade.

1521
02:26:13,629 --> 02:26:15,620
Come. Come.

1522
02:26:18,349 --> 02:26:20,385
Water! Get me some water!

1523
02:26:23,029 --> 02:26:27,739
He needs to be purged of the humours
that gripe him. I will prepare an emetic.

1524
02:26:27,989 --> 02:26:30,503
- Will he recover?
- Lf we act quickly.

1525
02:26:32,549 --> 02:26:34,858
- What of the race?
- He's too weak for that.

1526
02:26:34,949 --> 02:26:38,180
Already there is blood in his stool.
It's a bad sign.

1527
02:26:38,269 --> 02:26:41,067
Very well. I will leave him in your care.

1528
02:26:43,789 --> 02:26:47,304
- Well?
- He's in the hands of the physician.

1529
02:26:48,149 --> 02:26:52,108
- He means to purge him.
- Tell him not to. It'll make him worse.

1530
02:26:52,189 --> 02:26:54,339
It is not my place
to tell physicians their business.

1531
02:26:54,429 --> 02:26:57,466
They're sufficiently ignorant
of it themselves.

1532
02:27:03,509 --> 02:27:07,388
These are they who must decide.
My beauties.

1533
02:27:07,469 --> 02:27:10,779
Antares, Atair,

1534
02:27:13,029 --> 02:27:17,545
Aldebaran, and Akaba.

1535
02:27:17,629 --> 02:27:19,745
Come. Let them know you.

1536
02:27:24,829 --> 02:27:29,220
So, Judah Ben Hur,
what is this story I must hear?

1537
02:27:38,109 --> 02:27:41,738
- And the physician can do nothing?
- He's purging him as we speak,

1538
02:27:41,829 --> 02:27:45,617
but he assures me that he will not be
well enough to compete in the games.

1539
02:27:45,709 --> 02:27:48,018
As if these damn games
were not trouble enough.

1540
02:27:48,109 --> 02:27:51,419
It will only rouse the populace
if some Syrian or Arab wins the race.

1541
02:27:51,509 --> 02:27:53,898
They'll take it as another sign,
like this zealot in town.

1542
02:27:53,989 --> 02:27:56,742
Can you hear them?
Preaching the Kingdom is at hand.

1543
02:27:56,829 --> 02:28:00,026
Fortunately, we have a replacement to hand.

1544
02:28:01,829 --> 02:28:04,707
Do not tell me the next governor
will risk his precious skin.

1545
02:28:04,789 --> 02:28:07,508
What better way to announce my arrival?

1546
02:28:07,589 --> 02:28:10,262
Your son has sufficient skill?

1547
02:28:10,349 --> 02:28:12,863
Chariot racing is no amateur sport,

1548
02:28:12,949 --> 02:28:16,146
and should he compete and fail to win,
it would be worse than not competing at all.

1549
02:28:16,229 --> 02:28:19,938
I'll win.
You needn't concern yourself on that score.

1550
02:28:24,909 --> 02:28:26,547
So be it.

1551
02:28:28,029 --> 02:28:31,339
If you'll excuse me,
I must attend to other matters.

1552
02:28:33,949 --> 02:28:36,144
You're sure this will settle the matter
between you and the Jew?

1553
02:28:36,229 --> 02:28:38,220
It will for me.

1554
02:28:38,309 --> 02:28:42,621
And since he'll be dead,
I should imagine it will suffice for him also.

1555
02:29:11,349 --> 02:29:14,261
- You have their trust.
- Do I have yours?

1556
02:29:14,349 --> 02:29:17,739
I would rejoice
to see any emissary of Rome defeated.

1557
02:29:17,829 --> 02:29:21,026
But I ask myself,

1558
02:29:21,109 --> 02:29:23,464
"What will it benefit me or mine

1559
02:29:23,549 --> 02:29:27,224
"to make an enemy of Marcellus Agrippa,
a Roman senator?"

1560
02:29:27,309 --> 02:29:30,346
- Two hundred talents.
- Two hundred?

1561
02:29:31,709 --> 02:29:36,783
I will give you 200 hundred talents to wager
at whatever odds you can obtain.

1562
02:29:37,669 --> 02:29:40,581
If I win, you pay me back and keep the rest.

1563
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:47,183
You hate expensively, Judah Ben Hur.

1564
02:29:57,469 --> 02:30:02,702
Two hundred talents?
You must be mad or under-taxed.

1565
02:30:02,789 --> 02:30:05,667
If you're not confident you are going to win,
I understand entirely.

1566
02:30:05,749 --> 02:30:09,981
It is not a lack of confidence. Only surprise
that one such as yourself, Sheikh,

1567
02:30:10,069 --> 02:30:11,548
should have such a fortune to lose.

1568
02:30:11,629 --> 02:30:16,464
And let me understand. You're wagering
against my horses and my son?

1569
02:30:16,549 --> 02:30:21,703
- In favour of my own rider and my four.
- Take his money. Yours is safe.

1570
02:30:26,349 --> 02:30:27,702
Very well.

1571
02:30:28,469 --> 02:30:30,460
- What odds?
- Odds?

1572
02:30:31,669 --> 02:30:33,864
You want odds as well?

1573
02:30:33,949 --> 02:30:36,668
If you are so sure of winning,
what difference do odds make?

1574
02:30:36,749 --> 02:30:39,866
This is Judah's doing, is it not?

1575
02:30:40,789 --> 02:30:43,986
This is his way.
He means to destroy you, too.

1576
02:30:46,269 --> 02:30:49,261
He's a dangerous young man,
this Judah Ben Hur.

1577
02:30:49,349 --> 02:30:52,386
It seems his strategy is to humiliate Rome.

1578
02:30:52,469 --> 02:30:56,064
Would you have it known
that you refused the challenge?

1579
02:31:00,269 --> 02:31:03,147
- Five to one.
- We are agreed.

1580
02:31:13,389 --> 02:31:16,222
And the Sanhedrin
are demanding his arrest.

1581
02:31:16,309 --> 02:31:18,379
What do you think?

1582
02:31:18,469 --> 02:31:21,302
- On what charge, Excellency?
- Charge?

1583
02:31:23,829 --> 02:31:27,663
He chased the money lenders
out of the temple, isn't that enough?

1584
02:31:27,749 --> 02:31:30,741
The temple is not under Roman jurisdiction.

1585
02:31:32,029 --> 02:31:35,021
If they want him taken,
why don't they do it themselves?

1586
02:31:36,949 --> 02:31:42,467
It will not be easy to find him
with the city crowded for the Passover.

1587
02:31:42,549 --> 02:31:46,337
Well, they have one of his followers
who will deliver him.

1588
02:31:50,389 --> 02:31:53,461
Wait until after the race is over,

1589
02:31:53,549 --> 02:31:57,861
then take this rabble-rouser
and hand him over.

1590
02:32:08,149 --> 02:32:10,743
I remind you of a good, brave man, eh?

1591
02:32:14,629 --> 02:32:15,857
Yes?

1592
02:32:17,869 --> 02:32:20,702
Do not be afraid. They can sense it.

1593
02:32:21,989 --> 02:32:25,948
Come. Let him breathe you in.

1594
02:32:30,829 --> 02:32:32,945
Why are you here?

1595
02:32:35,829 --> 02:32:38,024
To ask you not to do this, Judah.

1596
02:32:44,829 --> 02:32:48,105
- It is too late for that.
- What if...

1597
02:32:48,189 --> 02:32:52,068
Esther, speak to me tonight
of if and maybe.

1598
02:32:52,149 --> 02:32:53,901
Until then it is in God's hands.

1599
02:32:53,989 --> 02:32:57,425
What God is that, Judah?
The God of an eye for an eye?

1600
02:32:57,509 --> 02:32:58,658
Is there another?

1601
02:33:01,829 --> 02:33:03,945
There is the God
who forgives us our trespasses

1602
02:33:04,029 --> 02:33:06,259
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1603
02:33:06,349 --> 02:33:08,146
I do not know that God!

1604
02:33:08,229 --> 02:33:12,427
But He knows you, Judah.
He loves each and every one of us.

1605
02:33:12,509 --> 02:33:14,227
Leave this be now!

1606
02:33:27,149 --> 02:33:30,221
Must you go through
with this race, Messala?

1607
02:33:31,869 --> 02:33:35,305
Do you think I can let him mock me
the way he did?

1608
02:33:36,669 --> 02:33:40,867
Do you think Marcellus Agrippa
would allow it, given all he's done,

1609
02:33:42,149 --> 02:33:43,184
all he's spent?

1610
02:33:47,629 --> 02:33:50,018
Damn Judah Ben Hur.

1611
02:33:51,109 --> 02:33:54,784
Is it true? You and he were once friends?

1612
02:33:58,469 --> 02:34:00,539
We were one another's best.

1613
02:34:02,509 --> 02:34:05,865
But it's as the gods have willed it.

1614
02:34:05,949 --> 02:34:09,942
The gods. They must have their games, too.

1615
02:34:13,069 --> 02:34:15,060
Who are we to deny them?

1616
02:34:20,389 --> 02:34:24,064
Ruth, what if he should die in this race?
For Messala means to kill him.

1617
02:34:24,149 --> 02:34:27,300
Die and never know
that you and Tirzah are alive?

1618
02:34:27,389 --> 02:34:29,345
And Ruth, what if he does not die?

1619
02:34:29,429 --> 02:34:33,502
Do you expect me never to tell him
even if he and I, God willing, should marry?

1620
02:34:33,589 --> 02:34:36,023
Mother, listen to Esther.

1621
02:34:37,789 --> 02:34:40,667
If he knew we were alive,
he might not do this thing.

1622
02:34:45,589 --> 02:34:46,988
Go. Go now.

1623
02:35:20,309 --> 02:35:21,458
Halt!

1624
02:35:29,149 --> 02:35:33,620
To Jupiter, greatest and best,
Juno, his consort,

1625
02:35:34,389 --> 02:35:38,621
and Minerva,
the mightiest one's mightiest offspring.

1626
02:35:38,709 --> 02:35:43,021
May this race represent our sacred vow

1627
02:35:43,109 --> 02:35:47,944
offered on behalf of he
who subjects the whole width of the Earth

1628
02:35:48,029 --> 02:35:50,941
to the rule of the Senate
and people of Rome,

1629
02:35:51,029 --> 02:35:54,226
Tiberius Julius Caesar, the August.

1630
02:35:54,949 --> 02:35:59,943
May these, his subjects,
strive to do him honour,

1631
02:36:00,029 --> 02:36:03,988
whatever lot the gods may choose.

1632
02:36:07,389 --> 02:36:12,338
In first rank, from Ecbatana,
Artostes Thuxra.

1633
02:36:18,909 --> 02:36:23,460
In second rank, from the Eternal City,
Octavius Messala.

1634
02:36:35,829 --> 02:36:40,698
In third rank, from Nineveh, Tukulti Esarra.

1635
02:36:46,949 --> 02:36:51,306
In fourth rank, from Meroe,
Taharga Shebitku.

1636
02:36:56,709 --> 02:37:02,818
In fifth rank, from Jerusalem, Judah Ben Hur.

1637
02:37:05,909 --> 02:37:07,820
- Judah!
- Judah!

1638
02:37:08,829 --> 02:37:10,467
- Judah!
- Judah!

1639
02:37:54,469 --> 02:37:56,699
Senator, shall we begin?

1640
02:43:44,229 --> 02:43:46,060
Come on! Come on!

1641
02:44:55,829 --> 02:44:56,818
Did I win?

1642
02:45:00,469 --> 02:45:01,458
Did I win?

1643
02:45:38,189 --> 02:45:40,862
Twelve years I have wasted on that fool,

1644
02:45:40,949 --> 02:45:45,067
and he ends up making a laughing stock
of me in front of a hoard of barbarians.

1645
02:45:45,149 --> 02:45:48,539
Not to mention putting me in debt
to an Arab.

1646
02:45:48,629 --> 02:45:50,984
I shall not pay, of course.

1647
02:45:58,709 --> 02:46:00,301
Well?

1648
02:46:00,389 --> 02:46:02,505
He's going to die.

1649
02:46:02,589 --> 02:46:04,181
That's all you have to say?

1650
02:46:04,269 --> 02:46:09,468
He has internal injuries I can't mend.
He's in great pain, and it will get worse.

1651
02:46:10,949 --> 02:46:16,740
- So what do you suggest?
- I suggest you alleviate his suffering.

1652
02:46:16,829 --> 02:46:19,218
Sorry. I can do no more.

1653
02:46:24,829 --> 02:46:28,424
At least he did not have
the nerve to ask me for a fee.

1654
02:46:32,549 --> 02:46:36,781
You have something in your pouch
that will do what is necessary?

1655
02:46:37,949 --> 02:46:42,625
I am curious, Marcellus.
Have you no affection for your son at all?

1656
02:46:47,269 --> 02:46:50,944
My feelings for him are not your concern.

1657
02:46:51,029 --> 02:46:55,898
Now if you wish to see him spared worse,
find a cure.

1658
02:46:55,989 --> 02:46:58,264
I must consult with Pilate.

1659
02:46:59,829 --> 02:47:02,662
Must be something we can do
about that Jew.

1660
02:47:21,829 --> 02:47:23,228
Judah.

1661
02:47:26,429 --> 02:47:28,226
I must see him.

1662
02:47:44,269 --> 02:47:48,228
Do you feel better
now you have taken your revenge?

1663
02:47:49,589 --> 02:47:52,501
I feel nothing.

1664
02:47:52,589 --> 02:47:54,545
Except that it is over.

1665
02:47:58,109 --> 02:48:00,464
There is something you must know.

1666
02:48:00,549 --> 02:48:03,586
- It can wait.
- This cannot wait.

1667
02:48:08,629 --> 02:48:13,225
- Why are you here?
- To bring a message from Octavius Messala.

1668
02:48:14,869 --> 02:48:17,622
- He still lives, then?
- Not for long.

1669
02:48:19,549 --> 02:48:22,666
- He asks for you.
- I have nothing to say to him.

1670
02:48:24,829 --> 02:48:29,380
- Judah, go to him. Forgive him.
- Esther.

1671
02:48:31,749 --> 02:48:33,899
I have no forgiveness in me.

1672
02:48:38,309 --> 02:48:39,981
I am sorry to hear that.

1673
02:48:44,949 --> 02:48:46,621
- Judah...
- Esther.

1674
02:48:50,389 --> 02:48:51,868
It is done.

1675
02:48:53,629 --> 02:48:55,187
Let him be now.

1676
02:48:57,509 --> 02:48:59,818
My mother and Tirzah are avenged.

1677
02:49:04,789 --> 02:49:08,145
Let us hope it makes them happier
than it does you.

1678
02:49:10,269 --> 02:49:15,297
Would it have made a difference, Judah,
if you'd known they were alive?

1679
02:49:15,389 --> 02:49:17,505
- What are you talking about?
- I have seen them.

1680
02:49:17,589 --> 02:49:20,501
- What?
- I have seen them, talked to them.

1681
02:49:20,589 --> 02:49:22,227
When I tried to persuade you
not to enter the contest,

1682
02:49:22,309 --> 02:49:23,662
- I knew where they were.
- You lie!

1683
02:49:23,749 --> 02:49:27,139
Then look into my eyes, Judah,
and see the truth.

1684
02:49:32,469 --> 02:49:35,666
Why did you not tell me?

1685
02:49:35,749 --> 02:49:37,068
I was sworn not to.

1686
02:49:37,149 --> 02:49:41,188
By who? Who would ask
that you agree to such a thing?

1687
02:49:41,269 --> 02:49:43,464
Your mother.

1688
02:49:43,549 --> 02:49:46,143
No, she would never ask that of you.

1689
02:49:47,709 --> 02:49:50,018
Why would she not want to see me?
I am her son.

1690
02:49:50,109 --> 02:49:52,065
She's a leper, Judah.

1691
02:49:54,829 --> 02:49:56,182
That is why.

1692
02:52:10,789 --> 02:52:13,701
Messala, take this and spare yourself.

1693
02:52:15,549 --> 02:52:17,426
You asked him?

1694
02:52:18,669 --> 02:52:20,421
He will not come.

1695
02:52:21,549 --> 02:52:24,461
You told him I was soon for the ferryman?

1696
02:52:26,189 --> 02:52:29,181
I must have offended him
more than I thought.

1697
02:52:31,349 --> 02:52:34,739
I would have him know I wronged him.

1698
02:52:36,309 --> 02:52:38,584
I've never forgiven myself.

1699
02:52:41,229 --> 02:52:42,821
Only he can do that.

1700
02:52:43,869 --> 02:52:47,384
Then this will ease all remorse.

1701
02:52:47,469 --> 02:52:50,745
A little weariness,
and then a long, long sleep.

1702
02:53:18,349 --> 02:53:23,503
- I've been here almost an hour.
- You forget I am still the governor, Senator.

1703
02:53:23,589 --> 02:53:25,625
I'm dealing with other matters.
What can I do for you?

1704
02:53:25,709 --> 02:53:31,545
It's a matter concerning Sheikh llderim,
he who lent his horses to that Jew imposter.

1705
02:53:31,629 --> 02:53:34,541
He has a claim against me.

1706
02:53:35,789 --> 02:53:39,384
- A wager.
- So you owe the Sheikh money. How much?

1707
02:53:43,949 --> 02:53:45,621
One thousand talents.

1708
02:53:47,829 --> 02:53:52,744
- That is a very great sum.
- Oblige me by not stating the obvious.

1709
02:53:52,829 --> 02:53:55,707
Does the Sheikh have witnesses to this?

1710
02:53:55,789 --> 02:53:56,778
Not for long.

1711
02:53:58,029 --> 02:54:02,784
So it is to be the word of a Roman senator
against that of a Bedouin Sheik?

1712
02:54:02,869 --> 02:54:05,747
Who can doubt which is to be trusted?

1713
02:54:05,829 --> 02:54:09,458
Bear that in mind,
and you may yet keep your position.

1714
02:55:33,389 --> 02:55:36,665
Forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

1715
02:55:49,429 --> 02:55:50,908
Forgive me.

1716
02:55:50,989 --> 02:55:54,698
You know, half my performance
is to convince myself.

1717
02:56:19,229 --> 02:56:22,585
- Move! Go!
- Go on! Faster!

1718
02:56:30,309 --> 02:56:33,938
- Faster!
- Move!

1719
02:57:23,629 --> 02:57:27,508
I don't know why or how,
but he's been waiting for you.

1720
02:57:32,869 --> 02:57:34,302
Judah.

1721
02:57:36,109 --> 02:57:37,588
You came.

1722
02:57:40,109 --> 02:57:41,701
I knew you would.

1723
02:57:42,949 --> 02:57:45,224
You knew more than I did.

1724
02:57:45,309 --> 02:57:46,537
Forgive me.

1725
02:57:52,389 --> 02:57:54,027
Please, forgive me.

1726
02:58:01,789 --> 02:58:03,381
I forgive you, Messala.

1727
02:58:08,789 --> 02:58:14,102
You caught me unawares last time
with the stick.

1728
02:58:17,509 --> 02:58:20,626
- Try me again.
- No, rest yourself.

1729
02:58:20,709 --> 02:58:24,668
There's time enough for that, Judah.
Just try me again.

1730
02:58:28,589 --> 02:58:33,902
The trick is to expect it to fall
at every given moment.

1731
02:58:37,229 --> 02:58:40,938
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1732
02:58:50,589 --> 02:58:52,466
Very nearly.

1733
02:59:07,549 --> 02:59:08,538
It is done.

1734
02:59:15,229 --> 02:59:17,868
You have to go, Judah.

1735
02:59:17,949 --> 02:59:20,463
One un-bought kiss before you go.

1736
02:59:24,629 --> 02:59:26,028
Go, Judah.

1737
02:59:59,829 --> 03:00:02,946
I commiserate with you on your loss.

1738
03:00:03,949 --> 03:00:06,338
I do not intend to pay that Arab.

1739
03:00:10,149 --> 03:00:12,060
Yes, well...

1740
03:00:14,069 --> 03:00:19,268
Who knows if he was even mine?
His mother was a whore. Like yourself.

1741
03:00:25,349 --> 03:00:30,742
We are leaving this accursed place,
so make haste.

1742
03:01:02,029 --> 03:01:03,303
For the ferryman.

1743
03:01:07,909 --> 03:01:10,548
Have him seat you next to your father.

1744
03:02:40,909 --> 03:02:50,548
THE END
