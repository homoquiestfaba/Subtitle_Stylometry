00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,724
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,301
- [Voice-over] (mumbles)
most about that?

4
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:35,535
- Not the people.

5
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,205
- [Voice-over] Right.

6
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,306
- No.

7
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,042
I'll (mumbles)

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,812
I'll miss everything.

9
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,319
But I had everything so I

10
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,786
can't feel

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,824
too terrible about missing

12
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,259
something that I had

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,260
for so long.

14
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,865
- [Voice-over] Wonderful.

15
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,671
- [Voice-over] Well
you know what?

16
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,573
I think I have a broken heart,

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,542
so how do I not
have a broken heart?

18
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:16,876
Well I'm telling you this,

19
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,711
if I knew this kid,

20
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,012
Harvey West would’ve
loved California

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,182
100 years ago.

22
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,386
(light music)

23
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:29,889
they say Harvey West
would love California

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,058
100 years ago.

25
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,528
- [Voice-over] I am an actress.

26
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,864
- [Voice-over] Do
they know each other?

27
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,865
Harvey.

28
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,203
- [Voice-over] I am an actress.

29
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,272
- [Voice-over] Harvey West
would have loved California

30
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,440
100 years ago.

31
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,643
- [Voice-over] I'm an actress.

32
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,445
- [Voice-over] Colleen West
never liked the first light

33
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,446
of day.

34
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,085
It made her nervous and
desperate for night.

35
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,758
Colleen met Harvey
two months ago

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,461
during a production
of Star Witness.

37
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,464
A play in which they both acted.

38
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,400
To have the same last name,

39
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,603
it meant something
to both of them.

40
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,239
It was their first connection,

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,607
and as time passed,

42
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,342
Colleen wondered if
it was their only

43
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,677
real connection.

44
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,218
And the silence,

45
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,219
silence.

46
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,622
Of you.

47
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,960
- [Voice-over]
Please make it stop.

48
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,443
(unintelligible talking)

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
anytime?

50
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,717
How are you?

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,421
How are you?

52
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,292
How are you?

53
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,827
- [Voice-over] This
is the hardest part

54
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,830
this is the hardest part

55
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,937
- [Voice-over] Things
become so clear.

56
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:32,179
Have you ever stared in
a mirror for too long?

57
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,114
To a point where you

58
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,685
become disgusted with yourself?

59
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,922
I once looked into a boy's eyes

60
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,425
and felt that way.

61
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,596
He had eyes like a deer.

62
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,935
He would look away and
it would only get worse.

63
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,104
Sorry I lost...

64
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,875
Why does he look away?

65
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,279
(screeching)

66
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,352
a shit year.

67
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,954
One.

68
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,356
Two.

69
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,357
Three.

70
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:29,303
This must be what (mumbles).

71
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,377
(dinging)

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,780

73
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,549
(humming)

74
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,949
- [Voice-over] Can you
believe that I'm retiring?

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,455
Can you believe that I'm...

76
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,424
- [Voice-over] Colleen West.

77
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,460
I think I could
look at your face

78
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,361
for 1000 years.

79
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,264
(laughter)

80
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,266
- I'm happy.

81
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,641
- [Voice-over] You're happy.

82
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:27,814
It hurts.

83
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,986
- it hurts me too.

84
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,458
- [Voice-over] He's so hurt

85
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,628
why then don't you show it?

86
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,800
- It hurts me too.

87
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,006
(unintelligible talking)

88
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,509
- did you want me
to stay in there?

89
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,144
- You know.

90
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,278
The play, our play
I can't believe its

91
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,279
over.

92
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,283
- It's always over.

93
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,319
You get used to it.

94
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,059
- Do you think I'm a good actor?

95
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,296
(laughter)

96
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,297
- what?

97
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,368
- Do you think I can act?

98
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,170
- I think you are full of

99
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,171
many...

100
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,441

00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,415
- [Voice-over] This
is the information.

122
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,416
Okay.

123
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,355

Then we will help you

129
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,839
make things right.

130
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,678
- What kind of
information do you need?

131
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,079
- In order to provide the best

132
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,181
simulation possible,

133
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,851
we will need to know everything.

134
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,988
- [Voice-over] Ask me anything.

135
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:22,990
- Excellent.

136
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,429
We need to collect
a breathing sample.

137
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,566
Will you be able
to provide that?

138
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,971
- A what?

139
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,439
- We need to understand how

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,441
he breathes.

141
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,023
- I don't think I
know how he breathes.

142
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,493
- In order to provide
the best simulation.

143
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,931
- Okay, I just breathe

144
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,068
like him.

00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,470
- If you're able.

146
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,310
Will you place this
under your tongue?

147
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,377
- Are you recording this?

148
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,880
- Was it accurate?

00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,118

now.

152
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,628
- You don't really think
how someone breathes.

153
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,630
- Maybe not,

154
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,731
but we do.

155
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,303
Can you please try again?

00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,538
I'll count to 10,

Hold still.

close your mouth.

00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,673
- Hey.

180
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,913
What are you doing?

181
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,416
- The horn wouldn't stop.

182
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,851
- Its' fine now.

183
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,852
- Are you sure
there's nothing wrong

184
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,853
with it?

185
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:20,993
You sure?

186
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,433
(blaring horn)

187
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,342
they don't understand
our relationship.

188
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,612
- What's

189
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,015
our relationship?

190
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,885
- You tell me.

191
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,889
- What?

192
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,361
- Do you think it's

193
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,362
shit?

194
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:21,988
- Hi.

195
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,891
You hear the birds this morning?

196
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,559
- Have a nice day.

197
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,928
- [Voice-over] The birds
have been going off.

198
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,464
- I only hear machines.

199
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,367
- Yeah man what are they
building over there?

200
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,668
- Maybe birdhouses.

201
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,004
- Right.

202
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,671
Did you just move?

203
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,207
- Sorry.

204
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,541
- I haven't seen you,

205
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,676
I live just down the
road with my husband.

206
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,578
- That's great.

207
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,079
I live over here.

208
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,281
- Oh I didn't know anyone
really lived over there.

209
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,516
- I do.

210
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:51,783
Now.

211
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,185
Very tired.

212
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,453
- Oh.

213
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,454
What from?

214
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,590
- I was with the circus.

215
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,725
- Really?

216
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:00,627
Wow.

217
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:01,893
- Wow.

218
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,029
- What was your talent?

219
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,663
- Well I

220
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:05,964
walked on ropes,

221
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,199
I ate fire,

222
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,734
and I was able to
speak to animals

223
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,502
in their native animal tongue.

224
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,903
- Wow.

225
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,739
Really?

226
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,906
- Really, wow.

227
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,443
- Must have been hard to
leave something like that.

228
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:21,180
It becomes like your
family doesn't it?

229
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,414
- Well you know I slept with two

230
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,816
of the clowns and
they were brothers.

231
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,418
Caused an enormous
amount of grief

232
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,686
for everybody,

233
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,555
we all felt it was
time for me to go.

234
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,556
- Oh.

235
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,527
- Yeah all I want is...

236
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,728
(mumbles)

237
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,330
- yeah me too.

238
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,169
I mean that's why James
and I moved down here.

239
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,637
- We have so much in common.

240
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,638
- Oh yeah?

241
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,640
Do you jog?

242
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,808
- No no.

243
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,478
Circus injury so no.

244
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,780
- Well

245
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,215
you should really
come over some time,

246
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,417
James loves interesting people.

247
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,651
- Really, me too.

248
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:00,952
When I get one I'll
be sure to bring

249
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,154
him over.

250
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,223
- Oh, well...

251
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,958
Okay great.

252
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,062
I'm gonna finish my run.

253
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,164
- Sounds wonderful.

254
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,766
(singing)

255
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,004
- [Voice-over] Bet
you get sick of that.

256
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,145
- Okay is that enough?

257
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,146
- No.

258
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,014
- All right all right.

259
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,014
- No.

260
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,017
You're not wet.

261
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,318
- Okay.

262
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,319
Gross.

263
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,989
- Come back from the light.

264
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,959
(mumbles)

265
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,194
- all right that's enough.

266
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,195
- Yeah.

267
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,269
Hold still.

268
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,337
- Thanks for the ride.

269
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,738
- Yeah well

270
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,607
I heard it was gonna rain.

271
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,744
- Riding a bike
in the rain sucks.

272
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,745
- It sucks.

273
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,248
- True.

274
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,917
- So tonight's your first dress

275
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,918
rehearsal.

276
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,321
- Yeah.

277
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,856
- Are you nervous?

278
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,857
- Horribly.

279
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,995
- [Voice-over] You'll be great.

280
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,632
(mumbles)

281
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,371
(mumbles)

282
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,140
- your house, it's so dark.

283
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,741
- Yeah.

284
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,677
People came and they
took the windows

285
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,678
away.

286
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,013
- Yeah?

287
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,318
- Yeah, took away the light,

288
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,588
only took them a few hours.

289
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,431
Dear darkness.

290
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,268
- You don't feel trapped?

291
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,269
- By what?

292
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,206
- The darkness.

293
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,409
- It's better than
being exposed.

294
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,911
- Yeah I guess so.

295
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,978
- People

296
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,553
they provide too much light.

297
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,628
- I want you to hit me.

298
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,263
In the face.

299
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,599
- (mumbles)

300
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,437
- we're fucking.

301
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,334
- [Voice-over] Miss West can
you give us a sound check

302
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,303
please?

303
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,703
- Sure, one two three four

304
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,872
five six seven eight nine.

305
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,110
- You know it really is
an honor having you here.

306
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,245
- Thank you (mumbles).

307
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,416
I'm very happy to be here.

308
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,318
- It's funny that this might

309
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,520
very well be your
last interview ever.

310
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,521
- Could be.

311
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,290
- Kinda like the

312
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,358
end of everything and
the start of nothing

313
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,359
right?

314
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,263
- Looks cold.

315
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,765
- Well

316
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,766
it was.

317
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,070
(mumbles)

318
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,238
- I'm fine right here.

319
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,106
- You sure?

320
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,007
(mumbles)

321
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,176
it's freezing.

322
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:20,647
- What do you want to be when

323
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:22,649
you grow up Harvey West?

324
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,985
- Well Miss West,

325
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,020
I don't know.

326
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,623
Maybe some guesses.

327
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,430
- You could be an explorer.

328
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,601
- (mumbles) explorer.

329
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,270
- Life would be low.

330
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:51,743
Underwater.

331
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,014
You're a natural in there.

332
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,249
- What about sharks?

333
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,985
- What about them?

334
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,455
(unintelligible talking)

335
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,957
- I am afraid of..

336
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,259
- What?

337
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,467
- I don't know anymore.

338
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,440
- How can you not know
what you're afraid of?

339
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,209
- I don't know.

340
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,379
Maybe as you get older...

341
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,483
- Come on tell me.

342
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
- Forget it.

343
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,453
- No tell me.

344
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,893
- I'd fear the end of loss.

345
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,706
Kiss me.

346
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:57,944
- Right here?

347
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,831
- So is this the
beginning of the end?

348
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,332
- Beginning of the end?

349
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,935
- Beginning of the end.

350
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,771
- What do you mean?

351
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,039
- I don't know our play's over

352
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
and

353
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,109
I'm retiring.

354
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,247
Who knows where you're going.

355
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,349
Away from me.

356
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,690
That's okay if this
is the beginning

357
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:45,691
of the end.

358
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,762
Kiss me (mumbles)

359
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,631
- all right.

360
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:52,732
I don't know.

361
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,069
- Something's waiting
for you out there

362
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,806
and it sure isn't me.

363
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,614
Am I wrong?

364
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,648
- [Voice-over] I don't know.

365
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,449
- You don't know.

366
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,454
You know you're not allowed
to say that anymore.

367
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,179
- [Voice-over] We have
everything prepared.

368
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,348
Unfortunately it's
not quite what we

369
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,117
told you it would be.

370
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,586
If do not wear the mask,

371
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,256
his face will not appear to you.

372
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,460
- Do you hate me?

373
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,199
- I can't hate you.

374
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,201
- Oh, good.

375
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:17,209
- I just want to
make things right.

376
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,379
- Are things wrong?

377
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,317
- I haven't heard from you in..

378
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,385
I miss you.

379
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,455
- I've been busy.

380
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,456
- Have you?

381
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,261
- Busy is good.

382
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,402
This mask is so uncomfortable.

383
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,337
- It's state of the art.

384
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,273
- Is it?

385
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,007
- Much time has gone into it.

386
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,008
- Yeah?

387
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,145
Did you help?

388
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,749
- Do you hate me?

389
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,750
- I...

390
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,125
How long are you gonna be here

391
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,125
with me?

392
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,697
- I don't know,

393
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,199
is there a window?

394
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,168
- Window?

395
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,270
- Of time.

396
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,710
- I don't know.

397
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,880
Windows are awful.

398
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,484
- But am I supposed to be here?

399
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
- What?

400
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,489
- Do you want me here?

401
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,125
- Yes.

402
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,126
- Yes?

403
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,738
- You don't seem like you.

404
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,707
- What do I seem like?

405
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,878
- You seem like a shadow.

406
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:01,713
- [Voice-over] It's the light,

407
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:02,848
the light is different here,

408
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:03,949
I am different in this light.

409
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,950
- [Voice-over] No.

410
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,151
- [Voice-over] Its the light.

411
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,318
- [Voice-over] No
it's not the light.

412
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,254
- [Voice-over] The
light is different here

413
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,888
I am different in this light.

414
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:10,823
It's the light.

415
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:11,857
The light is different here

416
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,024
I am different.

417
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,060
- [Voice-over] I can't
wear this thing.

418
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,828
(mumbles)

419
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,596
(heavy breathing)

420
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,498
- [Voice-over] It's the light.

421
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,432
The light is different.

422
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,633

(wind chimes)

427
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,165
- you're happy.

428
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,706
This hurts.

429
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,547
- [Voice-over] It hurts me too.

430
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,018
- If you're so hurt
why don't you show it?

431
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,089
- [Voice-over] It hurts me too.

432
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,342
- You know few actresses ever

433
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,445
really retire completely.

434
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,417
Can you confirm that
this is the real deal?

435
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,920
- Yeah this is it.

436
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:23,455
The real deal.

437
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,091
I absolute hate those words

438
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,092
together.

439
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,362
But for the sake of your show

440
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,363
I will

441
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,432
allow it.

442
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,434
- Thank you.

443
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:40,106
Are the parts simply not
what they used to be?

444
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,876
- Well you know as an actor,

445
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,979
when the writing is poor,

446
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,081
you make it interesting.

447
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,983
That's something i learned

448
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,618
a long time ago.

449
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:56,454
I considered writing a
piece for myself once,

450
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,455
but...

451
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,930
- What sort of themes or...

452
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:05,998
- Completion.

453
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,233
- Completion.

454
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:09,234
- Yeah.

455
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,075
- Thank you so much
for coming down.

456
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,709
- Oh my pleasure.

457
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,311
- Will you be
staying in the area?

458
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,679
- Los Angeles, no.

459
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,914
No my house just
sold I'm moving into

460
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,782
a cabin I own.

461
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:25,717
- A cabin?

462
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,019
- Yeah I've owned it for years.

463
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,489
Somebody told me
to buy it so I did.

464
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,125
We know who that person was.

465
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,261
- Is it in the general area?

466
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,362
- Miss West,

467
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,132
sorry, this came
for you earlier.

468
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,302
- One last fan letter?

469
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,038
- It's from my agent.

470
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,342
- Oh maybe they want you back.

471
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,017
- [Voice-over] Dear Colleen,

472
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,618
it's been an amazing adventure,

473
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,453
good luck with your retirement.

474
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,854
We went ahead and donated six

475
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,256
world globes to the
alternative academy

476
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,257
in Avalon.

477
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,160
Enclosed you'll
find a letter from

478
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,494
one of the students,

479
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,129
thanking you for your gift.

480
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,798
Keep in touch, Adam.

481
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,334
- [Voice-over] Dear Miss West,

482
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,802
thank you so much
for the gloves.

483
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,237
We can now spend
hours dreaming of

484
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:22,673
going to places that
we'll never get to go to.

485
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,509
One of the globes is broken,

486
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,843
it probably happened
during shipping

487
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:26,778
or something.

488
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,979
It's okay though,

489
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,247
because we use that
one to play with

490
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,715
when we're bored.

491
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,151
Have a great day, Marcus.

I'd be completely hopeless

It's the second
part of the morning.

00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,302
I guess I must have
missed the first.

it's yours now so...

542
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,941

to my doll collection.

544

to start one.

A doll collection.

Well have you ever

I'm gonna be making

Or even make one for yourself.

553
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,643
- I'm not familiar
with apple dolls.

554
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:26,578
- No?

00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,814
You seem so craft friendly.

- Cat friendly?

557
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,254

- What do you mean?

568
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,581
- Well,

569
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,117
I haven't been
sleeping very well.

570
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,053
And I don't know maybe it's like

571
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,389
all that nature.

572
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,828
Or maybe there's
something in the woods.

573
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,263
- Okay.

574
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:23,101
Well you'll let me know
about the apple dolls?

575
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,372
- All right.

576
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:28,373
- Bye.

577
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,794
- It's a doll made
out of an apple.

578
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,061
An apple.

579
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,731
Yeah isn't that great?

580
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,801
Great, that is fantastic.

581
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:58,803
Yeah.

582
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,772
I once tried to make
a doll out of a grape.

583
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,109
But it just didn't work out.

584
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,578
Those would have
been some tiny dolls.

585
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,416
Oh yeah, but
everybody loves tiny.

586
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,983
They certainly do.

587
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,319
Oh why don't we
get together once,

588
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,021
and we can talk about the things

589
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,790
that everybody loves.

590
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,459
That would be great.

591
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,128
What about a pumelo?

592
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,731
Think we could
make a doll out of

593
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:27,898
one of those?

594
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,734
What's a pumelo?

595
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,770
A pumelo is a
Chinese grapefruit.

596
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,039
Oh that's fucking fantastic.

597
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,042
I love Chinese horoscopes.

598
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,377
Where is my car?

599
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,352
♪ Silent night

600
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,358

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,967
- you find everything okay?

609
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:37,969
- Naturally.

610
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,774
Does everybody play this stuff?

611
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,811
Is it like some kind
of rule or something?

612
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,679
- You should try working here.

613
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,648
- No it really is everywhere,

614
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:51,750
look at this.

615
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,952
- Tis the season.

616
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,386
- You know what I like to do?

617
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,256
I like to put it on in my house.

618
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,627
And then I pretend I'm there.

619
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,467
(light music)

620
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:19,878
(unintelligible talking)

621
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,224
- Tamales?

622
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,225
- Fuck off.

623
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,446
Oh right,

624
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,949
the apple puppets.

625
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,950
- Dolls.

626
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:05,189
- I don't know.

627
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,757
- Oh come on.

628
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,458
You can't stay in your house

629
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,961
all day and night.

630
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,265
- No that would be
a terrible thing.

631
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,901
- I'm making an apple pie.

632
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:19,404
We have really fancy crackers.

633
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:25,075
- You mean you have
enough apples for

634
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,578
(mumbles)?

635
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,579
- What?

636
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:39,590
- What time did you
want me to come over,

637
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,859
if I come over?

638
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,561
- Seven.

639
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:48,834
- 30.

640
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:49,834
- 7:30.

641
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,605
- Mine is not really
coming together.

642
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:55,874
- No it's fine.

643
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,543
- I think you're

644
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,579
maybe using too much straw.

645
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,649
- Not enough.

646
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:08,585
- It's your first time.

647
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,921
- My first time.

648
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:13,691
- Colleen.

649
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,327
- What?

650
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,666
- Were you really in the circus?

651
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,604
- Kind of.

652
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,480
I was an actress.

653
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:37,815
- Yeah?

654
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,885
Have I seen you in anything?

655
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:42,053
- I don’t know.

656
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,054
I did about

657
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,825
35 movies in 30 years.

658
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:49,493
- Wow.

659
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,669
- It's strange to
remember your life

660
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,406
by what project you
were involved in.

661
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:03,742
Most people have

662
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,076
kids or

663
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:09,714
vacations.

664
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:11,415
Pets.

665
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,151
Something to remind themselves

666
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,420
how they lived.

667
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,391
Or that they lived

668
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,460
I should say.

669
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:30,100
- I could never be an actress.

670
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,101
- Why not?

671
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:34,538
- I don't know.

672
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:35,840
Memorizing lines,

673
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,342
pretending you're someone else.

674
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,777
Just doesn't seem like it would

675
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:40,778
be for me.

676
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:50,021
- Being someone else
can be very addictive.

677
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,293
It's funny how familiar
being a stranger

678
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:57,294
can be.

679
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:04,235
It's so comfortable it's like...

680
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,844
You can't think of
another way to breathe.

681
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,581
- Yeah?

682
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:18,582
- Yeah.

683
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,659
- Too cute right?

684
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,536
- My doll turned out terrible.

685
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,537
- No.

686
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,440
Tomorrow the glue will be dry.

687
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,976
Can add a few touches.

688
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:49,213
- You're so close to my house.

689
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:50,782
- What do you mean?

690
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,989
- I wish we could
just keep walking.

691
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,491
- We could keep walking.

692
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,660
- No no I mean

693
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,764
keep walking home.

694
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:10,835
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

695
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:12,736
- I don't know.

696
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,906
I have to walk home after.

697
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,313
- What am I doing here?

698
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:29,653
- What?

699
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:32,222
- I'm surrounded by
a world of nothing.

700
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,192
How did this nothing
become my something?

701
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:36,193
My...

702
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,096
My middle of nothing.

703
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,097
Nowhere.

704
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,701
- It's beautiful here.

705
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,736
- Nothing is.

706
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:48,072
Beautiful.

707
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,478
Tamales tamales tamales.

708
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,616
Nothing.

709
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:00,617
No one.

710
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
- Well..

711
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,724
There certainly aren't
any tamales out there.

712
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,160
- No there are no
fucking tamales.

713
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,161
- No.

714
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,972
- Did I tell you about Harvey?

715
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,241
- Who's Harvey?

716
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,478
- He's a fucking
disaster (mumbles).

717
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,081
A fucking disaster.

718
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:39,257
I loved him.

719
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,659
Or maybe I thought

720
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,997
that I could love him.

721
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:51,335
Losing my hope oh

722
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:53,171
God, I hate that word.

723
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,573
I never liked that word, never.

724
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:57,574
Hope.

725
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:00,811
Never trust a four letter word.

726
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,182
Apparently I was just

727
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,988
just a way for him
to pass the time.

728
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,058
(mumbles)

729
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,927
a circus act if you will.

730
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:17,929
- I'm sorry.

731
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,172
- I had a terrible year.

732
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,842
I lost everything.

733
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:44,489
You know when I
was 17 years old.

734
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,893
I saw this blind woman

735
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,728
walking down the street

736
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,298
with her groceries.

737
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:01,071
And there was no one
around to help her.

738
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,807
But she didn't seem to mind.

739
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,642
I mean not at all.

740
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,644
Not one bit.

741
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,749
So I followed her home.

742
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,853
She lived on the first floor

743
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,689
of an old brown stone.

744
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,860
I was fascinated by her.

745
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:25,996
I looked through her window

746
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,498
for about an hour.

747
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,740
She started to put
away her groceries.

748
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:41,946
And then she began
making dinner.

749
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,219
She was so beautiful.

750
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,092
And it was so
different from my life.

751
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,732
I signed up for my
first acting class

752
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,235
the very next day.

753
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,141
I think I needed something.

754
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,143
Some way to

755
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,980
channel all that empathy.

756
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,983
That woman changed my life.

757
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:21,219
She really did.

758
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,024
He was 22.

759
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:29,926
- Who was 22?

760
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:31,161
- Harvey was.

761
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,962
Can you believe that?

762
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:33,864
- Maybe it's time.

763
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,332
- For what?

764
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:38,069
- I don't know,
to appreciate it.

765
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,738
- You know that they say that

766
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:44,742
a change of scenery
is like a death.

767
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,116
But one of those good deaths.

768
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,850
You know like we had

769
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:54,852
start fresh.

770
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,857
You have a new
devotion to yourself.

771
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,095
But you know what,

772
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:06,531
since I got here,

773
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,034
I feel like I lost something,

774
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:13,371
and I don't know what it is.

775
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,276
I have no interest
in starting new.

776
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,245
I feel like I lost something,

777
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,148
and I don't know where.

778
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,253
Maybe it's in these woods.

779
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,855
- You know your house
is right up the road,

780
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,190
maybe we should go there first.

781
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,891
- No no I lost something,

782
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,026
and I think it's in these woods.

783
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,027
- Colleen.

784
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:39,763
- No.

785
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:44,369
I'll be fine.

786
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,405
- I can't just
leave you out here

787
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,073
like this.

788
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,475
- [Voice-over] Please do,

789
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:52,710
I will be fine.

790
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:04,622
- [Voice-over] Was the
character named Harvey West?

791
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,072
- This isn't about him is it?

792
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:27,778
- [Voice-over] What do you mean?

793
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,882
- The reason I'm here.

794
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:41,392
- [Voice-over] He's your
most recent disappointment.

795
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:53,204
Would you like to
take something?

796
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:56,740
We can

797
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:58,476
help you feel better.

798
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:06,284
- [Voice-over] Your
smell is enough.

799
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,519
Your smell is enough.

800
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,522
- [Voice-over] Your
smell is enough.

801
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,791
- [Voice-over] Your
smell is enough.

802
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,728
- [Voice-over] Your
smell is enough.

803
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:20,964
- [Voice-over] Limb to limb,

804
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:22,632
I follow you.

805
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:23,734
Limb to limb,

806
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:26,603
I follow you.

807
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,605
- [Voice-over] All of the sudden

808
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,206
I miss the sun.

809
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,009
- [Voice-over] We will
listen to the warmth.

810
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,412
- [Voice-over] All of the sudden

811
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,747
I miss everyone.

812
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:00,938
- Tamales.

813
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:01,938
- Fuck off.

814
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,983
- Merry Christmas.

815
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:17,654
- Rick.

816
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:18,823
- How are you?

817
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,426
- I'm terrible.

818
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,463
- So I got in my car
and I started driving.

819
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:27,564
And then I said wait a minute

820
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:28,998
it's almost Christmas.

821
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:32,002
I've gotta come and
visit my sister.

822
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,872
- That's so thoughtful
of you Rick.

823
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,441
- So how are you?

824
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:39,476
What's it like out here?

825
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:40,811
- It's not good.

826
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,048
They're building an absurd

827
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:47,250
number of houses across the way.

828
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,319
- Everywhere.

829
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,121
- I get about 30
minutes of quiet in

830
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,891
the morning and then.

831
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:57,828
I have all the time in the world

832
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:58,962
to myself.

833
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,330
Glorious, uninterrupted,

834
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,932
beautiful, gorgeous,

835
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:04,468
time alone.

836
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:08,238
- I couldn't do it.

837
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,507
- Yeah which part?

838
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:11,975
- You have any visitors?

839
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,411
- No, no I don't.

840
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:15,880
You are my first.

841
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,014
- Really?

842
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:19,784
What about neighbors,

843
00:55:19,785 --> 00:55:20,884
you got neighbors?

844
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:21,885
- Yeah.

845
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,690
There's one lady
and she took me out

846
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,259
in the woods and left me there.

847
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:33,063
- That's good.

848
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:36,667
The kindest of strangers.

849
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,271
- I wish she was a stranger.

850
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,540
Sometimes I think
that the kindest

851
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,975
part in my heart
is for strangers.

852
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,877
Do you know that this woman,

853
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:50,079
she took me over to her house,

854
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
and

855
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:55,118
she made me make these

856
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,120
dolls out of

857
00:55:58,556 --> 00:55:59,556
apples.

858
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,025
And straw.

859
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,967
- [Voice-over] I've been writing.

860
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,502
- Sounds great,

861
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,504
fiction or non fiction?

862
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:15,505
- Fiction.

863
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,875
Started out as a
short story but,

864
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,544
the ideas just kept growing

865
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,578
and

866
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:22,712
I mean my mind's on fire

867
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,780
all the time,

868
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:26,182
it's just gotten so big.

869
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:29,018
- Fantastic, what's it about?

870
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,521
- Office supplies.

871
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,557
- Office supplies.

872
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,191
- Yeah you know when
the employees go home

873
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,893
and the office
supplies intermingle

874
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,962
and they play games and stuff

875
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:39,963
like that?

876
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,865
Its a great idea,

877
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:44,434
you know what it
wouldn't be a bad movie.

878
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:47,336
It would be a great
animated film.

879
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,172
- [Voice-over] Well those
are certainly very popular.

880
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:50,807
- [Voice-over] Exactly,
I don't think they've

881
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:53,478
done one yet on office supplies.

882
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:57,447
- That's very observant of you.

883
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:59,283
What the hell is that?

884
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,785
- It's a rat.

885
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:03,987
- What is a rat doing here?

886
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:07,257
- It's either sun
bathing or it's dead.

887
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,159
- Get it.

888
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,896
- I'm not getting it.

889
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:14,631
- Rick get it.

890
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,265
- Not getting it.

891
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,366
- Pick it up please.

892
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,602
- I'm not picking the fucking

893
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:19,603
rat up.

894
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:24,207
- What does a dead rat mean?

895
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:26,110
You think it's an omen?

896
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,719
- In love and death,

897
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,722
the most important thing

898
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:40,525
is letting go.

899
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,129
- It's a rat Rick.

900
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:49,098
- Regardless,

901
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:51,035
it's the end of a life.

902
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:57,508
- I think we should
go back inside.

903
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,209
- I think we oughta give

904
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,210
it a name.

905
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:00,978
- What?

906
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,145
- The rat,

907
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:05,048
can you name something
you never knew?

908
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:07,718
- Do you feel you never knew me?

909
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,054
- Why does it always
have to come back

910
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:12,055
to you?

911
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:16,426
Can't we give the rat
a minute of respect?

912
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:20,163
And while we're at it,

913
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:24,233
why don't we bury
that moth eaten coat?

914
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,069
How many minks did it take

915
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,671
to make that thing?

916
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,505
- It's our mother's coat.

917
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,740
- It is?

918
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:31,908
- Yeah.

919
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:32,909
- Oh.

920
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,445
Well it's beautiful then.

921
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,446
I love mom.

922
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,750
I love when she would
walk around the house

923
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:41,852
in that coat.

924
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,756
And dad had one too
do you remember?

925
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:47,824
They had matching coats.

926
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:48,825
- They did.

927
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:08,177
- [Voice-over] To understand you.

928
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,680
To understand you.

929
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,585
To understand you.

930
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,756
- What are you doing?

931
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:20,957
- Painting.

932
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,395
- The wall's already white.

933
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,964
- Yes.

934
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:30,300
But another coat won't hurt.

935
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:39,243
- Who's that?

936
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,146
- [Voice-over] A friend.

937
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,082
- She's very beautiful.

938
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,216
- Yes.

939
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:52,656
She's beautiful in many ways.

940
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:53,490
- You're painting a wall that's

941
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:55,259
already been painted.

942
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:57,861
- I know.

943
00:59:57,862 --> 00:59:59,395
- Yeah why?

944
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:01,398
I just want to know why.

945
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,268
- If I don't paint it,

946
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,501
who will?

947
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:06,903
- Yeah but...

948
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:08,137
You don't need to paint it

949
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,740
now is this some...

950
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:15,045
Did someone tell you to do this?

951
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,815
- I don't know.

952
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:21,250
- That girl did she make
you paint this wall?

953
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,086
- Why do you keep asking

954
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:23,921
me that same question?

955
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,861
- I don't know.

956
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:34,097
- Are you mad at me?

957
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:34,965
- You're not allowed to ask me

958
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:36,033
that anymore.

959
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:38,969
- Do you hate me?

960
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,137
- That either.

961
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,746
I want to touch your face.

962
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:51,982
Can I just touch your face?

963
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,318
- You wouldn't want to
get paint on your hands

964
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:55,318
would you?

965
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,194
- Where did you go?

966
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,596
- I'm right here.

967
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:13,303
- You're here but
you're not here.

968
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:16,605
- If I'm not here,

969
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:17,441
then I am

970
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:18,441
with her.

971
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,050
- [Voice-over] So...

972
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,353
You're not here with me.

973
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,791
- [Voice-over] No I'm
here with you too.

974
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:40,029
- So you're here
with both of us?

975
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,030
- Yes.

976
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:50,807
- When you leave.

977
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:51,875
- I have to finish painting

978
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,110
before I can...

979
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:57,314
- But when you leave will...

980
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,783
Will we leave together?

981
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:02,052
Will you leave here with me?

982
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:05,089
- I'm not sure.

983
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:09,026
- Why are you not sure?

984
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:13,129
- Because I don't know.

985
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,064
- Why can't you know,

986
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,166
I just I need you to know.

987
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,369
- I'm not sure.

988
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:34,118
- You don't need
to paint that wall.

989
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,888
(machine noise)

990
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,259
- over easy just
like you like them.

991
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,527
Why don't we take a walk

992
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:47,596
to see what they're
building down there?

993
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,432
- A walk in the woods?

994
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,535
- Yeah that would be fun.

995
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:53,870
We could see what they're doing,

996
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,104
we just hear noise,

997
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,074
let's find out
what the noise is.

998
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,043
- Did you ever wonder if

999
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:00,609
there was another version

1000
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,679
of you somewhere in the world?

1001
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,780
Maybe they were a
day ahead of you

1002
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,450
or a day behind you.

1003
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,221
- What?

1004
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:15,224
- Another version

1005
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,459
of yourself.

1006
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,063
A more realized version of you.

1007
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,667
- That's a little over my head.

1008
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:25,669
- Nevermind.

1009
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,037
- You know once I was at a bar

1010
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,672
and this woman told me

1011
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,440
that I had a twin.

1012
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:32,808
And he was a garage mechanic

1013
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,211
and he lived right
down the street.

1014
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:37,513
But I never saw him.

1015
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,516
- Right down the street.

1016
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,619
Why were we never close?

1017
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,289
- You know I hate California.

1018
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,723
- No, Rick.

1019
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:49,726
Close like families are.

1020
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:51,928
Close.

1021
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,932
- Because you were
always working.

1022
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:57,566
And when we would get together,

1023
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:01,437
it was for such a
brief amount of time.

1024
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:04,608
I mean we never got
below the surface.

1025
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:10,513
You know I stopped
watching your movies.

1026
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:11,714
- Really?

1027
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,416
When was that?

1028
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,084
- A few years ago.

1029
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:18,754
- Everybody else
stopped a few years ago.

1030
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,389
- I just couldn't
watch you anymore,

1031
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,926
I mean I know it
doesn't make any sense.

1032
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:23,793
- Oh no it makes

1033
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:25,361
sense.

1034
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,230
- I just didn't want
our relationship to

1035
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:28,899
be through your art.

1036
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:35,105
- You know what occurred to me?

1037
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,310
That of all the parts I played,

1038
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:43,247
all those characters.

1039
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:46,750
They never experienced joy.

1040
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:48,784
They were

1041
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,020
joyless.

1042
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,092
And then I started to wonder

1043
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:58,262
if I ever experienced joy.

1044
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,467
And I had moments of happiness

1045
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:07,637
but, I was never
able to hang onto it.

1046
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,041
(mumbles)

1047
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,042
I'm joyless.

1048
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,611
- You know when I
heard you were retiring

1049
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:16,612
I panicked.

1050
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,483
I thought you were dying.

1051
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:23,286
- Jesus.

1052
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:26,322
- I mean why else
would you do that?

1053
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:28,158
Why would you do this?

1054
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:32,196
- Is this some kind of debt?

1055
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,399
- Do you think it is?

1056
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:40,436
- Rick, do you
think a person can

1057
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,939
be aware of their own madness?

1058
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:47,910
- I've told you 1000 times,

1059
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:49,179
you're not mad.

1060
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:52,016
You're just lonely.

1061
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:55,419
- My whole being is in pining.

1062
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:57,453
- Where should I look?

1063
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,522
- Look at me.

1064
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,361
Look at me like I'm the only.

1065
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,964
- [Voice-over] What,
the only what?

1066
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,000
- [Voice-over]
Don't say anything.

1067
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,336
Just hold still.

1068
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:16,872
Hold still.

1069
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,513
Don't look.

1070
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,482
Look up.

1071
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:29,552
Look up.

1072
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:30,553
Eyes to me.

1073
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:35,059
(light music)

1074
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:18,301
I'm here to make good.

1075
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:19,136
- Yeah?

1076
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,070
How so?

1077
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,070
- Well my

1078
01:07:22,306 --> 01:07:24,474
agent sent me this letter.

1079
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:28,477
And according to Marcus,

1080
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:30,479
I am responsible
for a broken globe,

1081
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,014
so here I am,

1082
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,850
I'm here to make good.

1083
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:44,393
Maybe I could just bring
it to his class room.

1084
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,029
- I'm sorry we don't
have a Marcus here.

1085
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,864
- Well who wrote the letter?

1086
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:49,865
- No idea.

1087
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:52,735
You said your agent
sent you this letter?

1088
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,170
- Yeah I was

1089
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:56,472
one of his actors.

1090
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:57,874
- No Marcus here.

1091
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,610
- Are you sure?

1092
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:02,611
- Yeah.

1093
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,350
- So so...

1094
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:11,488
Is this real?

1095
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,923
- It could be made
up, I don't know.

1096
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,125
- Why would he make it up?

1097
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:17,561
- I have no idea.

1098
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:23,932
The letter made you
feel good though right?

1099
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,201
- No.

1100
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,202
Between you and me
the letter made me

1101
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:27,437
feel like crap.

1102
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,340
And this Marcus, he's
a little piece of shit.

1103
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,442
- There is no Marcus.

1104
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:36,044
If there was a fucking Marcus,

1105
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,547
he would be a
sarcastic, ungrateful,

1106
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,416
piece of shit.

1107
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,752
You're not getting my globe.

1108
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,348
Fuckers.

1109
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,099
What brand are those?

1110
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,674
Give me one.

1111
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,631
What kinda school is this?

1112
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,066
- A shitty one.

1113
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:05,902
- Alternative academy?

1114
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,307
So you're a fuck up.

1115
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:13,009
- Definitely.

1116
01:10:17,281 --> 01:10:18,847
You seem pretty fucked up.

1117
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:19,683
- Do I?

1118
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:20,683
- Yeah.

1119
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,786
- That's very fucking observant.

1120
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:25,788
- Well they have a
psychology class here.

1121
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,491
- Learning is so important.

1122
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:29,493
- Sometimes.

1123
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,461
- You know if I ever saw again,

1124
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,798
I'd call you fucking Marcus.

1125
01:10:52,316 --> 01:10:54,417
- Did you ever
want to have kids?

1126
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:55,418
- No.

1127
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:57,654
And then yes.

1128
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,923
- No and then yes.

1129
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:03,292
- I was so committed
to my craft,

1130
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:05,127
to myself as an
artist that I couldn't

1131
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:07,030
give any part of it up.

1132
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,933
I was totally selfish.

1133
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,267
Could I have been
some child's mother

1134
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,869
who knows?

1135
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,271
They say that you get
the kids you deserve,

1136
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,608
something like that I think.

1137
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:23,712
I don't know what I
would have deserved.

1138
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,814
- Well you know in many
ways your characters

1139
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,918
could be thought of
as your children.

1140
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:34,357
- That's a horrifying thought.

1141
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:35,791
- [Voice-over] Its never
occurred to you though?

1142
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,060
- Yeah it has but,

1143
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:39,294
who would want to
hold on to something

1144
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,829
like that, I mean,

1145
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,898
as an artist you must

1146
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:43,899
let go.

1147
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:46,836
It's different every time.

1148
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:48,905
- [Voice-over] So you're
saying there's not

1149
01:11:48,906 --> 01:11:50,339
one way to go about it?

1150
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,607
- No, of course not.

1151
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:53,542
The process is so

1152
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:54,543
liquid.

1153
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:56,780
Takes a hell of a lot to keep

1154
01:11:56,781 --> 01:11:59,382
yourself from drowning.

1155
01:11:59,383 --> 01:12:00,416
I think it's just,

1156
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:01,617
I don't think they

1157
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:02,618
- [Voice-over] Do
whatever they want.

1158
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:03,919
(unintelligible talking)

1159
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,954
- [Voice-over] I think the head

1160
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:07,022
can get in the tail.

1161
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,290
I don't think the tail can

1162
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:09,558
get in the head.

1163
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:10,494
- [Voice-over] Yes. I
think you're right.

1164
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,027
- [Voice-over] I think so.

1165
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,530
- You know they're
spraying tonight.

1166
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,264
- Spraying what?

1167
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,266
- The new houses.

1168
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,035
Guess they have a moth problem,

1169
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:23,071
the moths are eating the trees.

1170
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:26,442
- I thought they
killed all the trees.

1171
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,712
- They're called skeletons.

1172
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:34,684
- Sounds like
something I could love.

1173
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:37,320
- Guess we're supposed to stay

1174
01:12:37,321 --> 01:12:39,254
inside while they spray.

1175
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:40,223
- Oh yeah because they wouldn't

1176
01:12:40,224 --> 01:12:41,558
want to kill us.

1177
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:44,160
- They probably do.

1178
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:50,999
- You know.

1179
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,802
I bet you wouldn't
think to check on

1180
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:54,971
me for a week.

1181
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,975
Maybe even 10 days.

1182
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,610
- But if I was dead,

1183
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:05,147
I wouldn't be able
to check on you.

1184
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:08,151
- But I could still
go to the woods.

1185
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,486
- You're going to
the rat party right?

1186
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:18,354
- Yeah.

1187
01:14:18,355 --> 01:14:19,722
You going?

1188
01:14:19,723 --> 01:14:20,723
- Yeah.

1189
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,560
See you there.

- I wrote a song.

1195
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:34,262
- Play it for me.

1196
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,365
- Its a work in progress.

1197
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:40,635

whether or not our simulations

that our simulations

- [Voice-over] Yes I understand.

1229
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,202
You've told me this before.

1230
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:29,871
- [Voice-over]
Perhaps we could work

1231
01:23:29,872 --> 01:23:32,108
on something else with you.

- [Voice-over] And
how did you find us?

1237
01:26:26,482 --> 01:26:30,985
- [Voice-over] Through the
other side of the forest.

1238

I can't believe,

1306
01:33:49,992 --> 01:33:51,058
maybe it was recorded
when you were pretty sick,

1307
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:52,326
but anyway,

1308
01:33:52,327 --> 01:33:53,560
- [Voice-over] I
just got off work,

1309
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:56,263
and I don't really
have any plans tonight,

1310
01:33:56,264 --> 01:33:57,464
seeing what you were doing,

1311
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:58,933
give me a call back.

1312
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:00,501
I'll just be
sitting at my house,

1313
01:34:00,502 --> 01:34:01,736
playing video games,

1314
01:34:01,737 --> 01:34:02,904
being depressed.

1315
01:34:02,905 --> 01:34:04,138
- [Voice-over] How are you?

1316
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:05,339
I haven't talked
to you in a while.

1317
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,874
Checking in and seeing
how everything is

1318
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:10,344
and (mumbles) taken a
whole bunch of things,

1319
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:12,379
were just not here anymore.

1320
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:16,450
I just wondered if you
knew anything about that.

1321
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:17,752
- [Voice-over] Hey.

1322
01:34:17,753 --> 01:34:19,754
Where are you?

1323
01:34:19,755 --> 01:34:20,755
Okay.

1324
01:34:20,756 --> 01:34:22,289
Give me a call bye.

1325
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,391
- [Voice-over] Yay, love you bye,

1326
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:25,693
give me a call at your house.

1327
01:34:25,694 --> 01:34:29,131
(unintelligible talking)

1328
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,441
- [Voice-over] It makes me
feel artsy or something.

1329
01:34:40,442 --> 01:34:42,009
All right love you bye.

1330
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:42,845
- [Voice-over] All right love,

1331
01:34:42,846 --> 01:34:44,078
take it easy, bye bye.

1332
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:44,913
- [Voice-over] All
right love you,

1333
01:34:44,913 --> 01:34:45,748
talk to you later.

1334
01:34:45,748 --> 01:34:46,748
Bye.
