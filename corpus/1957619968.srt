1
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,145
[music playing]

2
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,722
[gutteral growling]

3
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,668
[animal cries]

4
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,533
[bell ringing]

5
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,371
NARRATOR: After a promising
start at the Calgary Herald,

6
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,073
I took the train across
Canada and sailed to London

7
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,875
to make a name for myself.

8
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,678
But after a year as a junior
reporter on the Gazette,

9
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,080
my biggest assignment was
a dispatch on the opening

10
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,183
of the king's private zoo.

11
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,951
I was going nowhere,
until one day I

12
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,653
decided to speak up for myself.

13
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:07,995
Heard from Arthur yet?

14
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:08,929
No.

15
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,364
Nothing yet, Mr. Malone.

16
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,799
- Evening, Mr. Malone.
- Hey there, Jim.

17
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,434
McArdle in there?
- He is.

18
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,502
I was just off to
give him these.

19
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,836
MAN: Where the hell is that boy?

20
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,770
Coming, sir.

21
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,671
Let me do it, Jim.

22
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,642
Mr. McArdle.

23
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,543
Evening, sir.

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,312
Mr. Johnson.

25
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,046
I need to speak
with you right now.

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,014
All righty.

27
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,549
Well, what is it, Malone?

28
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,419
I request a transfer to the
front, sir, of whatever war

29
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,355
that might be in need
of a good reporter.

30
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,123
I'm sorry, Malone,
but we have a--

31
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,359
a shortage of good
wars at the moment.

32
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,593
Oh.

33
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,829
Well, uh, whatever dangerous
assignment that might

34
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,097
justify a man's existence.

35
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,734
Justify a man's existence?

36
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,701
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,869
Preferably far, far away.

38
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,344
Well, I'm afraid I have no
wars on distant, exotic places

39
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,579
I might send a junior reporter.

40
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,682
There is one assignment
of some importance.

41
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,883
What's that?

42
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,486
It might be just the
thing you're looking for.

43
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:10,023
Well, there's a George
Edward Challenger.

44
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,792
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,060
Yes, we do need a--

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,797
a good man to get an
interview with him.

47
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,031
Well, so Challenger, my boy.

48
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,600
This is your man.

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,869
There are some who
say he's the most

50
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,938
dangerous man in all London.

51
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:32,079
But I know that you are
just the man to handle this.

52
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,314
Now, if you'll
excuse us, we do have

53
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,948
a paper to get out tonight.

54
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,983
Oh, yes.

55
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,351
Thank you, sir.

56
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,587
You will not regret giving
me this opportunity.

57
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,924
[raucous laughter]

58
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:49,162
MCARDLE: 5 pounds he doesn't get
past Challenger's front door.

59
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,131
What's the angle, Mr. Malone?

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,167
ED (VOICEOVER): The
angle was I'd been had.

61
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,636
Are you off to
get an interview?

62
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,438
But they'd laugh out of
the other side of their faces

63
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,573
if I could just get
the Gazette a scoop.

64
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,409
The only interview
with this Professor

65
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,511
Challenger, whoever he was.

66
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,380
Everybody back home says
I'm a whiz with accents,

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,751
so I sent him a note posing
as a foreign scientist.

68
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,253
He fell for it.

69
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,156
Don Milan, I
received your letter,

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,059
and though I cannot think of
what part you may have in any

71
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,861
discussion of my
work, I will deign

72
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,164
to meet with you at the request
and time of my question.

73
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,199
You will have two minutes only.

74
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,406
Yours faithfully, George
Edward Challenger.

75
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,975
Como estas, senora.

76
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,276
Yes?

77
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,378
(ITALIAN ACCENT) I
have an appointment with

78
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,582
the great Professor Challenger.

79
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,652
You've obviously
never met my employer.

80
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:48,322
I have not had
the honor, senora.

81
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,158
Well, I apologize
to you in advance.

82
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,694
He's an absolutely
impossible person.

83
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,665
Absolutely impossible.
Forewarned.

84
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,768
As they say, he's fore-armed.

85
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:07,508
It is most considerate of
you, senora, forewarning--

86
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:12,112
Go quickly out of the room if
he seems inclined to violence.

87
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,549
And don't wait to
argue with him.

88
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,719
Several people have
been injured doing that.

89
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,588
I shall try to
keep that in mind.

90
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,256
I have no intention of arguing
with the great professor.

91
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,257
Well, see that you don't.

92
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,227
Don't mention reporters.

93
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,128
Reporters.

94
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,563
Of course.

95
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,033
That's as good a way as
was ever invented to ensure

96
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,970
a violent rage from the man.

97
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,338
[knocking]

98
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,940
Professor Challenger?

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,710
Your guest has arrived.

100
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,415
Now, remember what I told ya.

101
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,016
Professor Challenger.

102
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,951
Guiseppe Milano?

103
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,285
Yes.

104
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,121
I have come very far,
and at my own expense--

105
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,024
although that's no problem--
to tell you that you--

106
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,093
You say that you are a
great admirer of my work.

107
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,595
What exactly do you admire?

108
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,932
Why, your great research
into the field of animals.

109
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,703
My research on animals?

110
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,006
Of my vast body of work
in a myriad of fields,

111
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,711
you are particularly fascinated
by my research on animals?

112
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,114
Is that what they're
teaching of mine in, um--

113
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,182
Italy, was it?

114
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,083
Yes.

115
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,251
Where exactly in Italy?

116
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,486
Milano.

117
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,187
Guiseppe Milano from Milano.

118
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,522
How neat.

119
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,823
[speaking italian]

120
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,299
Si.

121
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,234
Si?

122
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,036
[speaking italian]

123
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,012
Ah, si.

124
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,014
Si.

125
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,250
So, uh, you agree that,
uh, the cranial index

126
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,218
is a constant factor.

127
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,352
Si.

128
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,688
And that you're
a fat, bald woman

129
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,355
with boils in your
behind, and two green cows

130
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,824
that give purple milk.

131
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,892
Uh--

132
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,960
You're the damndest
impostor in London!

133
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,564
A vile, crawling journalist with
no more Italian blood in you

134
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,866
than you have human decency
in your composition.

135
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,234
Sir, I only hoped--

136
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,870
To make a name for yourself
by furthering the preposterous

137
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,739
lies and fairy
tales that are told

138
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,007
about George Edward Challenger!

139
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,909
It's time that you
had your ears clipped,

140
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,078
and by God, George Edward
Challenger's the man to do it!

141
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,247
Listen here, sir, you can
be as abusive as you like.

142
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,682
All right, I'm not Italian--

143
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,317
in fact, I'm Canadian by
birth, but there is a limit.

144
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,819
You shall not assault me.

145
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,286
Shall I not?

146
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,488
You'll not be the
first of your kind

147
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,789
that I have thrown
out of this house.

148
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,191
You will, in fact, be
the 28th, I believe.

149
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,827
Don't be a fool, professor.

150
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,062
I'm 165 pounds,
as hard as nails,

151
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,997
and some 20 years your better.

152
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,599
[shouting]

153
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,545
Had enough?

154
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,292
What's all this?

155
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:16,096
This maniac attacked me.

156
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,431
Did you attack him?

157
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,500
It's not the first time, either.

158
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,336
You were in trouble last
month for the same thing.

159
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,538
And the month before.

160
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:30,844
Do you want to charge him, sir?

161
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,180
No, I don't.

162
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,081
I was to blame.

163
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,316
I-- I intruded on him.

164
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,685
He gave me fair warning.

165
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,854
Well, you're the first
one not to charge him.

166
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,193
Let's have no more such
goings on from you.

167
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,934
If there's anymore
trouble from him,

168
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,504
you call me straight
away, ma'am.

169
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,206
[laughter]

170
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,274
Now what?

171
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,243
Come up with me, mister--

172
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,544
Edward Malone.

173
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,613
Come on up, Mr. Malone.

174
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,180
Come on up.

175
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,619
Fond and frolicks in this house.
Sit down, Malone.

176
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,364
So, Mr. Guiseppe
Malone, journalist and

177
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,867
famous Italian impersonator.

178
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,568
Why have you gone
to such extravagant,

179
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,338
albeit inept
lengths, to find me?

180
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,873
I need a break, sir.

181
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,342
I need to make a name for
myself at the Gazette, so I--

182
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,444
I asked them for
a challenge, and--

183
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,946
the papers sent me to you.

184
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,415
McArdle and Johnson up to
their old tricks again, eh?

185
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,817
Mhm.

186
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,756
So, you want to challenge, eh?

187
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,475
Here.

188
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,710
Take a look at that.

189
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,414
Maple White.

190
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,315
Maple ?

191
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,316
That's an unusual name.

192
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,524
It's, uh, pretty
pedestrian stuff.

193
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,659
Press on.

194
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,099
What is this?

195
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:36,303
That, my young friend,
is the lost world.

196
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,581
Two years ago, I journeyed
to the upper reaches

197
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:52,019
of Lualaba river in the
heart of Central Africa.

198
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,121
It was my business to
visit that little known

199
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,790
and partially explored
country, and to examine

200
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,559
and catalog the fauna.

201
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,229
I was interrupted
from my studies

202
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,265
when I was summoned by a passing
tribesman to the deathbed

203
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,533
of a fellow traveler.

204
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,268
An American.

205
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,669
Over there!

206
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,238
GEORGE (VOICEOVER): I
knew nothing of this man,

207
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,541
nor what service I, with only
a slight knowledge of things

208
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,077
medical, might do for him.

209
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,312
But the tribesmen
were insistent.

210
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:32,392
Inside I found a man
who, through later

211
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,596
perusal of his scant belongings,
I discovered to be one

212
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,731
Maple White.

213
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,304
The tribesmen had
found him stumbling

214
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:49,509
through the jungle, bleeding
and half-mad with sickness.

215
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,078
My drawings.

216
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,249
My sketchbook.

217
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,718
You must go there.

218
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,854
They won't believe you.

219
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,356
But it's all true, you see?

220
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,992
It's all true.

221
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,264
It's the lost world.

222
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,839
GEORGE: It is his sketchbook
that you hold in your head.

223
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,507
From the contents
of the knapsack,

224
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,009
it was quite clear
that Maple White

225
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,444
was something of
an artist, and also

226
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:28,181
something of an adventurer.

227
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,550
You ever seen
anything like that?

228
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,786
No, I haven't.

229
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,523
And to what known species
might that bone belong?

230
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:40,427
I must confess that I
haven't the faintest notion.

231
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,829
[laughter]

232
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,097
You need not be ashamed
to confess your ignorance.

233
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,532
For I doubt that the
entire membership

234
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:49,269
of the Royal Zoological
Institute could identify it.

235
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:54,908
It belongs, I am quite
sure, to that beast there.

236
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,310
What the hell is that?

237
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,949
That is exactly what I
was intrigued to find out.

238
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,852
So intrigued that I
resolved at that very moment

239
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,821
to abandon my own
travel itinerary,

240
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:15,262
and to set out to find
that strange place.

241
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,899
I continued downriver by
canoe, and my companions

242
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:23,036
where Pedro, a Portuguese
who served as a translator,

243
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,306
and a powerful man named Pujo,
the leader of my small band

244
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,508
of native bands.

245
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,678
I had found a rudimentary map
in Maple White's belongings,

246
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,480
and I set out to
retrace his steps.

247
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,082
Let's try over there.

248
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,851
GEORGE (VOICEOVER): The map was
vague, and difficult to follow.

249
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,786
Many times we were
forced to retrace

250
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,455
our path after days
of futile paddling

251
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,957
in the wrong direction.

252
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,600
After many weeks on the river,
I finally found the spot where

253
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,567
Maple White had gone ashore.

254
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,383
We continued on foot for many
days, our supplies of food

255
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,585
running dangerously low.

256
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,024
It was tough going, and it began
to wear out at our strength.

257
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,027
And at Pedro's loyalty.

258
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,163
Unbeknownst to myself
or the loyal Pujo, Pedro

259
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,432
had become fixated
upon the knapsack.

260
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,501
He was sure it contained
some great treasure--

261
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,670
jewels or valuable stones--

262
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,205
because I guarded
it so intently.

263
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,445
This I did not learn
until we'd almost

264
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,248
reached the hidden plateau
of Maple White's book,

265
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,918
and by then it was
almost too late.

266
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,954
Pedro, what the
devil are you--

267
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,922
[screaming]

268
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,490
[gunfire]

269
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,992
Challenger!

270
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,226
GEORGE (VOICEOVER): Pedro
had cut my leg to the bone.

271
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,395
Our bearers ran
off into the night.

272
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,098
There was no choice
but to turn back.

273
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,933
But first, I had
to get a glimpse

274
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,269
of the astonishing world
Maple White had sketched.

275
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,441
When I saw that great
vista, the pain in my legs

276
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,909
seemed to disappear.

277
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,146
But I knew that I had
found something tremendous.

278
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,649
Tremendous and
completely unprecedented.

279
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,586
We've found it, Pujo.

280
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,553
We've found it!

281
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,392
[shouting]

282
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,205
GEORGE: That was
all I saw of it--

283
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,273
a glimpse.

284
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,643
But it was enough
to make me believe.

285
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,978
Believe what?

286
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,414
That what I had seen
was a pterodactyl.

287
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:50,350
A creature thought extinct
for millions of years,

288
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,121
and that they lived there, in
a world cut off from evolution

289
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,356
and the forces of nature.

290
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,758
The lost world.

291
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:02,895
That's-- quite a story.

292
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,597
I'm afraid that
is all my colleagues

293
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,166
are inclined to call it.

294
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,067
A story.

295
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,872
No one would believe me.

296
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,142
On my return to London I
attempted to communicate

297
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,910
my great find to my colleagues
at the Royal Zoological

298
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:21,214
Institute, only to be met with--

299
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,616
derision and cruel jokes.

300
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,320
Certainly you had photographs,
or some kind of proof?

301
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,355
No.

302
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,757
All lost.

303
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,926
Lost in a run in with some
rapids that capsized our canoe,

304
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,364
and nearly cost Pujo
and myself our lives.

305
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,033
Well, if you were inclined
not to believe the story,

306
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,468
what would you say to that?

307
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,077
I think that any man that
has the courage to make a claim

308
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,511
like yours--

309
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,013
to seem foolish, to--
to accept ridicule,

310
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,416
and not give up the fight--

311
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,919
I think that man has earned
the right to be heard out.

312
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,490
You are no fool, Malone!

313
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,058
You are no fool at all!

314
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,562
You want a challenge.

315
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,497
Is that it?

316
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,599
Well, by God, you
shall have one.

317
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,302
Your coming here today has
given me a capital idea--

318
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,003
an idea on how to
turn the tables on all

319
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,705
those fools that scoff at me.

320
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,978
Come with me tonight,
and I will give

321
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,680
you the challenge of your life.

322
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,052
ED (VOICEOVER): An
exclusive interview

323
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,222
with the infamous George
Edward Challenger.

324
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,389
And what a story.

325
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:37,724
I mean, this is
front page material.

326
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,893
Old man McArdle's going
to lose his 5 pound bet.

327
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,529
Too bad.

328
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,763
Mr. Malone!

329
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:44,831
Mr. Malone?

330
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,932
What-- Jim?

331
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,234
What are you doing here?

332
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,601
I thought you might need--

333
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,969
an assistant.

334
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,271
I thought I was going
to be the youngest

335
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,273
reporter in London.

336
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,374
Come on.

337
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,143
Let's see what trouble
we can get into, eh?

338
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,415
[pounding gavel]

339
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,735
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, can we have some quiet?

340
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,070
Thank you.

341
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,572
Now to business.

342
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,541
We are gathered here today
to present an award of honor

343
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:32,145
to our distinguished
colleague, Professor Summerlee.

344
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,681
[applause]

345
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,784
Where's Challenger?

346
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,153
Probably out in the streets,
slugging it out with a cabbie

347
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,390
over the price of a fare.

348
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,692
[applause]

349
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,864
Distinguished
guests, friends--

350
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,700
You are no friend of mine.

351
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,001
How dare you?

352
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,703
I repeat, you're no
friend of mine, Waldron.

353
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,271
Nor of science.

354
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:02,442
If you are, as I suspect, about
to lavish praises on that--

355
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,846
that boring fraud who dares
to call himself a scientist--

356
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,047
Challenger, you scoundrel.

357
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,616
Are you referring to me?

358
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,551
That I am, Summerlee.

359
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,187
You wish to honor
the man that made

360
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,590
Professor Summerlee the
exalted scholar he is today?

361
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,525
Then honor me.

362
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,328
That's quite
enough, Challenger.

363
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,095
[laughter and applause]

364
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,633
Professor Summerlee's entire
distinguished academic career

365
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:30,136
has been made
solely by rebuttal,

366
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,971
but his own personal standards.

367
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,673
The man has furor.

368
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,041
I'll give him that.

369
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,211
While I risked life and limb
accumulating the hard facts

370
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,314
of science, and-- and
molding them into theories,

371
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:45,285
Professor Summerlee sat
comfortably by his nice

372
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,887
kitchen fire, in his armchair.

373
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,389
Theories?

374
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,723
Facts?

375
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,191
No, Professor Challenger.

376
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,993
Fantasies.

377
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,695
Pipe dreams.

378
00:19:55,795 --> 00:20:00,132
Claims of such little worth
as, say, the discovery of what

379
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,768
you call the lost world.

380
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,174
Oh, you may laugh.

381
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,676
You may laugh!

382
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,012
All-- all discoverers have
met with the same response.

383
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,547
Bravo!

384
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,917
You deride those who push
back the frontiers of science.

385
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,652
You persecute the prophets.

386
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,422
Galileo, Darwin, Challenger!
[applause]

387
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,990
Or, perhaps, you've
already found Galileo

388
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,662
and Darwin living happily
in that lost world of yours?

389
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,730
[laughter]

390
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,266
No, sir, I did not.

391
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,768
But you may.

392
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,404
What do you mean by that?

393
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,972
Are you prepared to
stand by your word?

394
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,843
I demand that this institution
mount an expedition

395
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,947
to examine my findings,
to verify or disprove

396
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:52,552
my claims that prehistoric life
still exists upon this planet.

397
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,622
I demand it in the
name of science!

398
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,989
[applause]

399
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,860
And I demand that Professor
Summerlee leads the expedition.

400
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,796
[applause]

401
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,669
[pounding gavel]

402
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,139
Order!

403
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,309
Mr. Challenger's motion will
be discussed in due course.

404
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,810
In due course.

405
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,380
Deal with it now!

406
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,314
Order, order!

407
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,883
We will have order!

408
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,151
In the meantime--

409
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,686
In the meantime,
we are left to wonder

410
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,556
if perhaps the professor's
claims are true.

411
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,491
And who might
you be, young man?

412
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,593
I'm Edward Malone,
from the Gazette.

413
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,828
I think the people of
London-- my readers--

414
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,196
deserve to know the truth.

415
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,131
Yes, well, I'm sure you and
your readers would like nothing

416
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,802
better than have the institute
spend a fortune traveling far

417
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,805
and wide simply to refute
the claims of a well-known

418
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,239
madman and liar.

419
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,809
You libelous pennant!

420
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,110
Yes, sir.

421
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,347
And what's more, I volunteer
to go on this expedition.

422
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,383
That is, if you are
leading it, sir.

423
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,957
What are you gonna
say, Summerlee?

424
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,359
Well, Summerlee?

425
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:12,632
I will be delighted to
lead any expedition that

426
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:16,669
will expose Professor
Challenger as the utter fool I

427
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,071
know him to be.

428
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:19,972
And he will, then.

429
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,674
It is decided.

430
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:25,077
Professor Summerlee will lead
this expedition to Africa,

431
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:31,618
and Mr. Malone will report upon
his findings to the newspapers.

432
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,453
Are there any other volunteers?

433
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,021
Could I come?

434
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,022
A boy?

435
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,590
[laughter]

436
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,927
I volunteer.

437
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,633
I would like to join
this expedition.

438
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,202
Well, if there are no
more serious volunteers,

439
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,705
I announce this
meeting adjourned.

440
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,106
Excuse me.

441
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,842
The doctors of the institute
will meet tomorrow morning to--

442
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:56,876
JENNIFER: Mr. Chairman?

443
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,478
Discuss the funding
of the Sumerlee--

444
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,079
JENNIFER: Mr. Chairman,
I demand you hear me out.

445
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,181
Mr. Chairman?

446
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,684
[applause]

447
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,455
I want to go, Mr. Malone.

448
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,056
I could be a big help.

449
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,057
You know I could.

450
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,258
Well, I don't know, Jim.

451
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,292
I mean, these
scientists won't be too

452
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,260
happy to have a reporter along.

453
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,294
To take a boy, as well--

454
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,763
I'm not a boy.

455
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm almost 13.

456
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,599
You have to let me go.

457
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,101
I just don't see how
I can manage it, Jim.

458
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,235
I thought you were my friend?

459
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,270
Jim?

460
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,271
Congratulations, Mr. Malone.

461
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,906
That is really--
- Thanks.

462
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:27,840
Jim, wait!

463
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,944
It's out of the question.

464
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,081
I will not have Challenger
on my expedition.

465
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,717
Your expedition?

466
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,919
I have explored
Africa for over 20--

467
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,054
You nominated me as
leader, Challenger.

468
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:46,493
I will not have you along,
messing up my well-made plans.

469
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,628
If he goes, I will not.

470
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,102
Confound you, Summerlee.

471
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,770
I will stay behind.

472
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,739
MAN: Miss, you simply
mustn't go in there.

473
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,673
JENNIFER: There's no
way you're going to--

474
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,407
Yes?

475
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,609
And we're going in.

476
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:03,743
This is private.

477
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,247
My card, Professor Murray.

478
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:12,418
Miss J.A. Nielson, of Chicago.

479
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,220
I'm sorry to
interrupt, gentlemen,

480
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,156
but I was not given a
chance to speak last night.

481
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,658
Unforgivable.

482
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:22,461
The students are a
rowdy lot, you see?

483
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,063
I would like to
join this expedition.

484
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:24,964
Good lord.

485
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:25,932
A suffragette.

486
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,199
Exactly.

487
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,036
I am an experienced wildlife
photographer, professor.

488
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,905
For the Smithsonian and the
National Geographic Society,

489
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,273
among others.

490
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,143
You will need documentation of
anything you find in Africa.

491
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,345
I have traveled most of the
world, and could possibly--

492
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,446
Yes, I'm sure
you have, my dear.

493
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,781
I'm sure you have.

494
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,651
But unfortunately, the
policy of this institute

495
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,953
does not allow women to
go on our expeditions.

496
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:47,854
Policy?

497
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,526
Well, gentlemen, it's 1912.

498
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,362
I'd say it's time you
changed your policy.

499
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,864
You'll be hearing from me.

500
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,099
Monstrous.

501
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,102
Extraordinary.

502
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:07,473
Her family is one of
the wealthiest in America,

503
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:10,276
and great contributors
to science.

504
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,978
Perhaps we could consider--

505
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,646
Murray, I am adamant.

506
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,882
The woman will not
go on the expedition.

507
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,917
She will only
endanger the mission.

508
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:37,704
Morning, my dear.

509
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:38,638
Good morning,
Professor Murray.

510
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,539
Good morning, Malone.

511
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,941
Professor?

512
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,676
Murray, I thought
we agreed that

513
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:44,977
the policy of the institute--

514
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,346
My dear Summerlee,
I have to inform you,

515
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,617
the directors of the institute
have granted a special approval

516
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,419
for Miss Nielson to
accompany your expedition

517
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,421
as our official photographer.

518
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,690
She offered to fund
the entire project.

519
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,428
My dear Summerlee,
how could we say no?

520
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,863
Good luck, Miss Nielson.

521
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:08,034
Get a fine photograph
of my pterodactyl.

522
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,036
Professor Challenger,
I assure you,

523
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,171
if there's anything to
photograph, I'll get it.

524
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,110
If we could get
on board, please?

525
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,947
We do have a timetable.

526
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:24,717
Ah-- I do wish I was
going with you both.

527
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,152
- Malone!
- Henry!

528
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,419
Over here!

529
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,320
Excuse me.

530
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,723
Excuse me.

531
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,492
For the long, hard nights.

532
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,027
Bon voyage, old chap.

533
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:35,828
Good luck.

534
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,429
Happy hunting, and all that.

535
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,831
Thanks.

536
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,499
ED (VOICEOVER): Dispatched
to the London Gazette,

537
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,934
by Edward Malone.

538
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,203
After much controversy, the
Summerlee expedition set

539
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:45,972
out today for darkest Africa.

540
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,974
Some members of the
expedition doubt the wisdom

541
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,876
of leaving Professor
Challenger behind,

542
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,711
but Summerlee is adamant.

543
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,279
The question remains, however--

544
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,282
how will Summerlee lead us
to a place he does not know?

545
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:57,750
Preposterous, Challenger.

546
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,453
After all, I am the
leader of the expedition.

547
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,555
Cabin 5B, please.

548
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,658
Summerlee, you will
take this letter,

549
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,093
and you will not
open it until you

550
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:10,196
reach Kalemie at the headwaters
of the Lualaba river.

551
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,799
Then, at the designated
hour, you will open it,

552
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:18,237
and you will receive your
directions to the lost world.

553
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,539
Amateur theatrics.

554
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,708
Come on, Mr. Malone.

555
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,275
We've wasted enough
time already.

556
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,448
Goodbye, sir.

557
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,582
Goodbye, lad.

558
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,985
That eye's looking
better already.

559
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,255
Oh, if only he wasn't
such a pompous ass!

560
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,925
Oh, I say, how good of you.

561
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,626
Ha ha!

562
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,528
Tally ho!

563
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,562
Fine sailing!

564
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,431
Bon voyage, mon capitan!

565
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,099
Au revoir, professor.

566
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,034
Adieu.

567
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,302
Ah.

568
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:53,833
Wow.

569
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:01,941
Is there someone down here?

570
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:06,913
[coughing]

571
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,499
Hard to get
comfortable in here.

572
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,568
A stowaway, you say?

573
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,638
Well, where is he?

574
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,506
Oh, this is him.

575
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,076
Why, I thought it was--

576
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,744
what's the meaning of this, boy?

577
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,512
I only wanted
to help out, sir.

578
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,547
Help out?

579
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,749
How could you possibly help out?

580
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,752
Well-- I'm very handy, sir.

581
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:50,056
And-- I wanted an adventure.

582
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,958
I wanted a chance
to prove myself.

583
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,695
Let me give him a
talking to, professor.

584
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,696
Yes, you do that.

585
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,099
I've got more--

586
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,067
Jim?

587
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,034
Captain?

588
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,403
Captain?

589
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,571
I'm surprised at you.

590
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,439
- I'm sorry, Mr. Malone.
- Yeah?

591
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,910
Well-- don't be.

592
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,411
I know what it's
like to be ambitious.

593
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,146
You gotta take chances.

594
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,215
Jim, you're on the team now.

595
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:16,916
But Summerlee--

596
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:17,850
What's he going to do?

597
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,817
Turn the boat around?

598
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,619
Throw you overboard?

599
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,354
Nope, we're stuck with you.

600
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,255
Shake on it.

601
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,062
ED (VOICEOVER): To the London
Gazette, dateline Kalemie.

602
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,064
This missionary outpost
is at the farthest end

603
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,033
of the road from Das Es Salaam.

604
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:37,036
It is an odious collection
of gold prospectors, natives,

605
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,605
missionaries, Portuguese
on the run from the law,

606
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,273
donkeys, and goats.

607
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,742
This is the last dispatch
I can send by telegraph.

608
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,644
From here we travel
down the Lualaba river,

609
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,313
through unsettled territory.

610
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,948
We hope Professor
Summerlee can find

611
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,616
the spot from which
Maple White trekked

612
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,551
inland from the lost world.

613
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,990
- Malu?
- Yes?

614
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,425
Don't let the
children wander off.

615
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,759
Excuse me?

616
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,594
I couldn't help noticing
that you're American.

617
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,931
Edward Malone, London Gazette.

618
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:05,932
Kate Crenshaw.

619
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,033
I run the settlement store.

620
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,700
Oh.
And this is, uh--

621
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,635
Rebecca.

622
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,203
Miss Rebecca.

623
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,072
It's not often that I meet
someone new who speaks English.

624
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,441
Yes, well, we're hiring
porters for an expedition up

625
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,876
the river, and so far the only
one we've found that speaks

626
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,379
any English is, uh-- him.

627
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,613
Ah.
Gomez.

628
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,748
Yeah.

629
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,550
He is Portuguese,
from the coast.

630
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,385
Not one of my best students.

631
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,855
He learned the language, but
I'm afraid the basic principles

632
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:32,491
of Christian charity
were lost on him.

633
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,160
I was afraid of them.

634
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,263
Personally, I have absolutely
no doubt about your honesty.

635
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,232
These testimonials you
gave me are impressive.

636
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,700
Very impressive.

637
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,703
We should hire, uh, only
those men who are very strong,

638
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,639
who can carry the heavy
loads, and who know the river.

639
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,540
Mm.

640
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,942
[non-english speech]

641
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,611
These are the men
from the Mojo tribe.

642
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,046
They are the best.

643
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,348
What language do they speak?

644
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,385
Only I can speak both their
languages-- yours and theirs.

645
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,686
That's not so, Gomez.

646
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,753
- Malu?
- Yes?

647
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,688
Could you come here?

648
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,861
Professor Summerlee, could you
join us for a moment, please?

649
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,631
There's someone I'd
like you to meet.

650
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,033
This is Malu.

651
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,402
She could accompany you
as interpreter and guide.

652
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,370
It's an honor
to meet you, sir.

653
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,506
My pleasure.

654
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,407
And you, sir.

655
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,878
You, uh-- you speak
excellent English.

656
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,715
I learned at the
mission school, sir.

657
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,350
Miss Kate taught as well.

658
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,319
Certainly did.

659
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,486
I'm, uh, Professor Summerlee.

660
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,488
This is Edward--

661
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,589
I'm-- I'm Edward Malone.

662
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,159
This is-- Professor Sumerlee.

663
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,493
And I'm Jenny Nielson.

664
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:45,597
Nielson You don't have
to call us sir or madam.

665
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,335
That, uh, rascal back
there, that's-- that's Jim.

666
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,270
Hiya.

667
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,373
Is she the only one that
can speak both languages?

668
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:58,010
Meeting capable women is
a new experience for him.

669
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,048
I would like to come with you.

670
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,716
That is, if you can manage
the children, Miss Kate.

671
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,752
Oh, we'll get
by somehow, Malu.

672
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,387
We always do.

673
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,656
Very well.

674
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,792
Gomez, you select the men,
and make the arrangements.

675
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:14,993
Yes, professor.

676
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,367
Who are you?

677
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,072
What do you want?

678
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,339
Now, these canoes--

679
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,850
A tuppenny worth
of all candies, miss.

680
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,919
Stocking up, are you Are
you a part of the expedition?

681
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,354
- Oh, look at this.
- Yeah.

682
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,089
Ah.

683
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,890
Where are you going?

684
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,792
Well, this has
gotta be the warmest.

685
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:47,726
Where is that?

686
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,894
No, not that one.

687
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,196
Why not?

688
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:51,763
I did a photo story
on a family of zebras

689
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,532
at the San Francisco
zoo last spring.

690
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:56,202
I'd hate to think of them
turning out like that.

691
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:58,970
Well, personally, I'd rather
be skinned than in a cage

692
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,472
for the rest of my life.

693
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,940
[mock whimpering]

694
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,675
I don't like to
think of wild animals

695
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,011
as caged or skinned, Mr. Malone.

696
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:08,614
And I don't like people
who make jokes about it.

697
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,216
Really?

698
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,751
Well, I'm not freezing to death
on account of some stupid idea

699
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,320
about zebras' rights.

700
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:20,659
I'll take it.

701
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,228
And, uh, four of those.

702
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,708
Attention, everybody.

703
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:41,513
I have a very important
announcement to make.

704
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:47,419
To be opened at Kalemie upon
the 15th of November at 12:00,

705
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,354
precisely.

706
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,823
Ah.

707
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,991
One minute to.

708
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,226
Should be precise on that.

709
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,341
Nothing.

710
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,510
No map.

711
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,845
This is the proof that
the lost world is a fraud,

712
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,816
and that buffoon Challenger
is a liar, and a fake.

713
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,985
Am I late?

714
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,888
I thought the time
agreed was 12:00

715
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,023
noon, if I recall correctly.

716
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,525
[chiming]

717
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,827
Perfect timing.

718
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,162
Ha ha ha!

719
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:33,131
If this is your idea of
a joke, I am not amused.

720
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,733
Oh, my dear
Summerlee, you don't

721
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,703
really think that I would allow
you to go without me, do you?

722
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,940
Besides, since I'm the only
person who knows the way,

723
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,744
they have to take me with them.

724
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,045
All right.

725
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,614
You might be coming
along, you scoundrel,

726
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:54,085
but let us not forget who is
in command of this expedition.

727
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,122
Of course not,
my dear Summerlee.

ED (VOICEOVER): Somewhere
on the Lualaba river.

00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,802
We've been paddling
for 17 straight days.

732
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,839
Sometimes we feel we're being
watched from the jungle,

733
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,875
but it's been a week since we
saw a human being of any kind.

734
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,244
Is Challenger lost?

735
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,391
How about a
little help, Gomez?

736
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,727
I'm so sorry, princess.

How far downriver
do we travel?

739

Professor Challenger's
the only one who knows.

740
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,239
He's keeping it a secret.

741
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,544
If you have a map or
a chart, Challenger,

742
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,813
I should like to know
where we are heading.

743
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:58,016
Any map is up here
in my head, Summerlee.

744
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:01,453
And as for where we're heading,
you as the intrepid leader

745
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,689
of our extinction should know.

746
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,723

Much relief all around.

749
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,417
Challenger has found the
spot where Maple White's map

750
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:32,884
says we should start inland.

751
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:33,919
Right.

752
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,121
That's as far as we go by canoe.

753
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,724
From here on, it's on foot.

What are they saying, Malu?

759
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,147
The drums speak to the
tribes in the highlands.

760
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,149
They say we are coming.

761
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,684
Right.

762
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,054
We'll cover the canoes as best
we can, and then press on.

763
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:13,425
We'll spend the night here,
and start early in the morning.

764
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,762
As you wish, Summerlee.

765
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,664
I'm sleeping over here.

It is impossible to
tell from the drums

00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,179
how close the natives are.

771
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,047
We must be constantly
on our guard.

[sigh]

773
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,898
I'll keep watch.

You're cold.

- Malone!

00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,538
Would you call me Edward?

777
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,472
Please?

778
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:03,842
Edward.

779
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:19,257
Do you think they
want to stop us?

780
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,760
Maybe they do.

781
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,829
Maybe they want
their world to stay--

782
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:24,763
lost.

783
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:36,908
Miss Nielson, go ahead.

00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,780
Come along, now.

785
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,748
Chop chop.

786
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,260
Are they going to
attack us, professor?

787
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,529
Oh, I don't think so, my boy.

788
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,965
Their purpose is
far more subtle.

789
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,199
They mean to frighten us.

790
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,233
It's working.

791
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,535
How much further, Challenger?

792
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:07,706
Oh, a day or two.

793
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:08,674
Three.

794
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,676
Are we lost?
Because if we are--

795
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,451
It seems that our pursuers
will follow us no further.

796
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,220
Which means, my dear
Summerlee, we're getting close.

797
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,121
Wonderful.

798
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,055

Well, there's
nothing remarkable.

We've all seen igneous
extrusions before.

You'll see, Summerlee.

00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,436
You'll see.

809
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,438
The way ahead lies
through that valley.

810
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:15,373
Well, it can't be any
worse than the jungle.

Gomez!

906
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:29,587
Yes?

907
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:32,357
Guard the end of the rope.

908
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:33,258
Fine!

909
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,566
Any help with that
camera, Miss Nielson?

910
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:42,834
First let me take a picture.

911
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:44,402
Hold still.

912
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:45,336
Good.

913
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:46,637
I'll be right there.

914
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,574
We should fence ourselves
in with these thron bushes.

915
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,542
Who knows what's out there.

916
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,144
[laughter]

917
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,149

00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,397
Challenger!

922
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,200
You remember Pedro?

923
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,735
Who died two years ago?
Your killed him!

924
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,805
He was my brother!

925
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:23,441
Now you are trapped,
and you will die!

926
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:26,577
You are a greater
scoundrel than Pedro, Gomez.

927
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,280
And you deserve the same fate!

928
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,648
[gun cocking]

929
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:31,883
Save your
ammunition, professor.

930
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,484
We may need it.

931
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,385
We're stranded here.

932
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:41,826

00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:47,732
of getting back down the cliff.

I hope this dispatch
will somehow

937

find its way to the Gazette,
so I will continue writing.

Ha.

Actually, the last letter I
sent back was from Kalemie.

945
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,921
Challenger won't let me
publish till we return, anyway.

946
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:11,156
Don't lose that notebook.

really like out there?

00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,439
Look.

950
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,409
The stars are all turned around,
and the moon's on its side.

951
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,814
It really is a different
world out here.

00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,850
Well, it's not London.

956
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,272
I never thought about it.

957
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,041
Why?

958
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,410
I was just wondering.

Let me shake your hand.

00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:55,753

Careful!

970
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,056
It's all right, Miss Nielson.

971
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:00,291
I believe that they
are anatosauri.

00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,029
Perfectly harmless.

00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,498
But that doesn't apply
to all dinosaurs, does it?

975
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,499
Oh, no, no.

976
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,936
There were huge,
carnivorous dinosaurs.

Blast you, don't
keep us in suspense!

1011
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,171
It's a cave of some sort.

00:53:27,272 --> 00:53:28,573
Very old.

1013
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:31,376

Thank you.

Confound you, Summerlee.

1042
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,129
You've frightened them.

00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,698
Ah, they're all right now.

1044
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:06,256
Well, thank you, my dear.
It's not very serious.

1045
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,592
Vicious birds.

1046
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:09,193
Pterodactyls, Summerlee.

1047
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:10,861
Pterodactyls.

1048
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,362
Not birds.

1049
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,064
The ancestors of birds.

1050
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,567
And judging from the
rocks around their pit,

1051
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,504
they could have been there
since the, oh, triassic era.

1052
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:22,840
Cretaceous era, I think.

1053
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,209
Challenger, I may have been
wrong about the dinosaurs,

1054
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,977
but don't tell me my geology.

1055
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:28,178
It's my field.

1056
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,248
Speaking of rocks--

1057
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:32,883
I've been looking at that one.

1058
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:34,719
We should be able to get
a pretty good overall look

1059
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,721
at the plateau from up top.

1060
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,557
You're not proposing to
climb it, are you, dear boy?

1061
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:44,461
Well, as we know, I'm not
much of a climber, but, uh--

1062
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:45,596
No problem.

1063
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,924
Keep an eye out for snakes.

1064
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:25,836
Well done, Jim!

1065
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:41,952
There's a great, big lake!

1066
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,754
It's amazing!

1067
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,523
I'll tell you all about
it when I come down!

1068
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:02,239
I saw an ape.

1069
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,207
Or a man.

1070
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:04,208
What?

1071
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:05,375
A little of both, actually.

1072
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:09,013
He had a painted
face, like a skeleton.

1073
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:10,948
We'd better keep a
close watch out tonight.

1074
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:11,882
Yes.

01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:32,129
Where were you going?

1080
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:33,463
I'm sorry, Mr. Malone.

1081
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,733
I saw a light from up that rock.

1082
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,167
I thought I'd
investigate a little.

1083
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,970
The jungle is no
place for a kid--

1084
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,905

What is this, a

1087
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,225
Let me up.

1088
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,459
Oh, up?
Yeah.

1089
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:03,393
Yeah.

1090
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,198
You should learn
to be more careful.

1091
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,400
If I hadn't recognized you,
I would have used this.

1092
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:16,373
Come on.

1093
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:17,641
Let's go.
- Yeah.

1094
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:18,709
Back to the camp.

1095
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,177
I want to see that lake.

1096
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:21,078
Jim!

1097
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,148
It's not far.

1098
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:24,849
All right.

1099
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:26,050
But I'm going first.

1100
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,185
The two of you
follow, close behind.

1101
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:29,486
No.

1102
01:01:29,586 --> 01:01:31,756
I think that I should go first.

1103
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:34,458
I am more accustomed
to the jungle.

1104
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,493
All right.

1105
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:37,394
Come.

1106
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,239
Mr. Malone.

1107
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,174
Look.

1108
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:00,951
I wonder what's under the water?

1109
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,052
That's not an animal.

1110
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:04,454
That's sulfur.

1111
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,455
Nasty stuff.

1112
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:17,601
Well, I've seen
enough for one night.

1113
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:18,836
I'm right behind you.

1114
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,476
I read in a book that
man eating dinosaurs

1115
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,212
may have hunted at night.

1116
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,580
I hope this dinosaur
didn't read the same book.

1117
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,648
I think he did.
- Run!

1118
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,783
Run!

1119
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:39,123
Come on!

1120
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:49,399
[growling]

1121
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,651
[sniffing]

1122
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,720
It smells us.

1123
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:11,721
- Wait here.
- Wait.

1124
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:12,823
Malu!

1125
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,571
Smear the juice on your face.

1126
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:28,472
What?

1127
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:29,406
Just do it.

1128
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:22,626
[sigh]

1129
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,197
You stink.

1130
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:28,165
So do you.

1131
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,874
Morning.

1132
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:38,976
Morning.

1133
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:44,448
It's a wonderful day.

1134
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,989
They'll be wondering
what happened to us.

1135
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:56,293
I smell like a
prehistoric fruit salad.

1136
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,962
So McArdle bet Johnson
he couldn't do it.

1137
01:04:58,062 --> 01:04:59,096
Is that right?

1138
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,264
No one's ever
done this before.

1139
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:01,698
Getting with the
Challenger, I mean.

1140
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:03,067
Really?

1141
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,802
This whole thing--

1142
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,372
Jenny?

1143
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:09,373
Jenny?

1144
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:10,174
Challenger!

1145
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:11,441
Someone's been in the camp.

1146
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:12,376
Summerlee!

1147
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:13,377
Blood.

1148
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:14,344
Blood?

1149
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:15,745
Jenny!

1150
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:16,813
Oh, god!

1151
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,248
How could I have
left them alone?

1152
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,016
Oh, poor Jenny.

1153
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,650
It was that skeleton man.

1154
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,252
More than one, I'd say.

1155
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,754
They know nothing about guns, or
they wouldn't have left these.

1156
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,991
The blood has left a trail.

1157
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:27,891
It's fresh.

1158
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:29,026
Maybe an hour old.

1159
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,827
Let's pray
they're still alive.

1160
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,363
[shouting]

1161
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,634
[singing]

1162
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:15,405
There's Summerlee.

1163
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:16,573
And that's Jenny.

1164
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:17,807
What are they doing to them?

1165
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,376
And-- and who are
those other people?

1166
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,744
It looks like
they're preparing

1167
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:23,013
them for some kind of ritual.

1168
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,549
Where is Challenger?

1169
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:26,450
There.

1170
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,818
On the right.

1171
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,388
[shouting]

1172
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,203
[horn blowing]

1173
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:51,108
What's he up to?

1174
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,610
[horn blowing]

1175
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:55,945
[roaring]

1176
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:57,481
Listen.

1177
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,383
[roaring]

1178
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:00,850
Ha ha ha!

1179
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,353
[non-english speech]

1180
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:10,960
Yes, yes.

1181
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,762
Now, my name is Challenger.

1182
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,599
Professor Challenger from
Cambridge University.

1183
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:19,936
Member of the Royal
Zoological Society.

1184
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:20,904
Yes, yes.

1185
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,772
Now, look, my dear chap--

1186
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,175

[singing]

1190
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,106
They're going to feed
them to the dinosaurs.

1191
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:58,208
But why?

1192
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,743
- No time to wait for an answer.
- Wait!

1193
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:00,744
There's too many of them.

1194
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:02,446
We can't just let them die!

1195
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:03,613
Wait a second.

1196
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,849
I just remembered
something I read in a book.

1197
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,751
It might just work.

1198
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:09,052
I need wood, for
a very hot fire.

1199
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:10,920
And-- and the linint
of your jacket.

1200
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:11,821
Quickly.

1201
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:21,731
[singing]

1202
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,138
Where are you taking him?

1203
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,140
What are you
doing with this man?

1204
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,142
Let this man go!

1205
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:33,677
Let this man go, you--

1206
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,146
what the devil is it
you're doing with him?

1207

1211
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,702
Let go of me!

1212
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:01,971
Untie me!

1213
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,540
Get your hands off me!

1214
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,508
Let go of me!

1215
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:05,842
I said, let go!

1216
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,079
Summerlee, I'm terribly sorry!

1217
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,381
That's all right!

1218
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,951
I hope Jim's idea works.

1219
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:15,919
There it is.

1220
01:09:19,923 --> 01:09:21,391
[gunfire]

1221
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,728
Look!

1222
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,063
Balloon!

1223
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,633
Balloon from the gods!

1224
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,000
Run!

1225
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,369
Run for it!

1226
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:33,303
Excuse me, please.

1227
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:35,138
Excuse me.
Thank you.

1228
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,774
Thank you.

1229
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:38,675
Jenny!

1230
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,677
Over here!

1231
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:41,511
Malone!

1232
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,714
I thought you'd never get here.

1233
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:45,649
This way!

1234
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:54,591
Good work, Malone.

1235
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,992
Look out!

Come on!

You can do it!

1245
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,656
Come on!

1246
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:30,193
Do those people
look friendly to you?

1247
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:32,529
Look there, professor!

1248
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:33,797
Handy form of defense, then!

1249
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:34,698
Here!

[non-english speech]

1253
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:03,760
He is Palala, the
chief of his tribe.

1254
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,861
And this is their home.

1255
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:06,996
He welcomes us to join
him and his people,

1256
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,132
where we can all be safe.

1257
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:11,768
Tell him we
would be delighted.

Malu.

1263
01:11:58,582 --> 01:12:01,351
Does this dance mean anything?

1264
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:04,354
The dance speaks of
the history of the tribe.

1265
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:06,956
It calls upon the gods
to reunite the tribe,

1266
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,925
to heal the good ones.

1267
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,326
The good ones?

1268
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,328
The skeletal man and
chief Palala's people

1269
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,898
were all one once.

1270
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,233
they worship the dinosaurs
as the embodiment

1271
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,936
of the spirit's will on Earth.

1272
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:23,407
So, how do you tell a
good one from a bad one?

The plant eating
dinosaurs are the good ones.

1274
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,477
They represent the
spirit's kindness.

1275
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:29,379
Chief Palala's people
have lived in peace

1276
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:30,614
with them for centuries.

1277
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:33,883
So, the bad ones
are man eaters, then?

1278
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,919
The man eating
dinosaurs are feared,

1279
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:39,556
like evil gods or devils.

1280
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:41,691
How did the tribes divide?

1281
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,993
Not so long ago,
the witch doctor

1282
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,362
convinced some of the
other members of the tribe

1283
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:49,699
to worship the evil ones.
[non-english speech]

1284
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:51,000
Good heavens!

1285
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,368
Oh, look.

1286
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,903
A baby pterodactyl.

1287
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:00,910
Poor little chap.

1288
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,311
You don't look so well.

1289
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:05,482
It's sick, isn't it?

1290
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:07,250
All the good ones are sick.

1291
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,752
The tribe tries to heal them.

1292
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:11,387
They dance every night
for their recovery.

1293
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:12,989
Hello, Percy.

1294
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:13,957
It's fascinating.

1295
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,859
Quite a specimen.

1296
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:19,395
It all but confirms my theory
of Jurassic extinction,

1297
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:21,998
all predicated on
microbiologic contagion.

1298
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:23,800
Your stupid theory?

1299
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,802
Is that all you care
about, professor?

1300
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,538
Living creatures are dying, and
you're hatching a new theory.

1301
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,760
Mr. Malone!

1302
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,761
Mr. Malone!

1303
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:52,762
It's Summerlee!

1304
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:53,730
He's gone!

1305
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:54,664
Huh?

1306
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,340
[non-english speech]

1307
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,374
I understand, Imana.

1308
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:06,275
Shh.

1309
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,210
Quiet.

1310
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,081
They're the same t same
leaves they had on us.

1311
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,153
They feed them to the dinosaurs.

1312
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:20,223
The plant is a medicine.

1313
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:21,891
Just as I had supposed.

1314
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:27,897
[growling]

[shouting]

1316
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:33,637
Come on!

1317
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:36,305
I need some of those leaves!

1318
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,241
[shouting]

1319
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:49,986

[shouting]

1321
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:10,006
Go!

1322
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:10,940
Hide!

1323
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,182
[shouting]

1324
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:51,280
[non-english speech]

1325
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,530
Summerlee!

1326
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:09,498
Where in heaven's
name have you been?

1327
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,500
I was intrigued
by those wreaths

1328
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:14,270
that the skeleton men
put around our necks

1329
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:17,306
when they attempted to
feed us to the dinosaurs.

1330
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,943
I wondered if that wasn't
the point of the whole thing.

1331
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:22,478
I'm afraid I don't
follow you, Summerlee.

1332
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,813
Well, when you
were a child, didn't

1333
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,049
your mother ever try and
disguise your medicine

1334
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,483
in something sweet?

1335
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,852
Chocolate, for example?

1336
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:31,354
Well, it's the same
concept here, Challenger.

1337
01:16:31,454 --> 01:16:35,959
We were the chocolate, and
these plants are the medicine.

1338
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:38,361
Oh.

1339
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:41,631
He likes it.

1340
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,133
I think he likes it.

1341
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:45,669
[screeching]

1342
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,437
It's a miracle, professor.

1343
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:50,306
Not really.

1344
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:52,208
Just good science.

1345
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:54,210
You were right, professor.

1346
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:59,348
The Summerlee theory on the
extinction of the dinosaur.

1347
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,750
They all became ill.

1348
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,619
Some prehistoric
version of the plague.

1349
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,055
And yet here, there
are some survivors.

1350
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:11,761
Ergo, the antidote must
grow here on the plateau.

1351
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:14,630
And Imana was a
brave young girl.

1352
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:16,099
She showed me the way.

1353
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,033
Imana.

1354
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,201
[non-english].

1355
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:25,041
Hello.

1356
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,576
Summerlee?

1357
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:29,979
That was a jolly good show.

1358
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,347
Well done.

1359
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:32,916
Thank you, Challenger.

1360
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,727
[singing]

1361
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:54,738
And it runs around the
split bamboo aqueduct

1362
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:57,874
to the central point.

1363
01:17:57,974 --> 01:18:02,345
And the water is distributed
thusly, keeping the soil

1364
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:05,749
in optimal growing condition.

1365
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:07,717
[non-english speech]

1366
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:10,019
It's a wonder,
Professor Summerlee.

1367
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:15,091
Modern horticulture to
grow a prehistoric plant.

1368
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,893
With the help of
modern technology,

1369
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:18,594
Chief Palala's
people should find

1370
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,765
a way to keep their good
ones healthy and strong.

1371
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,206
Hey!

1372
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:33,076
Give me my hat!

1373
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:34,443
Give me my hat!

1374
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,045
Come here, Imana.

1375
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,424
I'll wager that now that
they've lost their leader,

1376
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:52,661
these skeleton people are
anxious to rejoin the tribe.

Chief Palala says he will
do anything to repay you.

01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:43,546
What do you wish for?

1382
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:45,681
Thank the great chief.

1383
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,250
Tell him our only
request is that he

1384
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,718
show us a way down
from this plateau,

1385
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:51,821
and back to our own world.

1388
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:28,424
What's he say, Malu?

1389
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:31,760
Palala says he will do
as we ask on one condition.

1390
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:35,398
[non-english speech]

1391
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,566
He says we must all
make a vow that we will

1392
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,202
return if his people need us.

1393

[non-english speech]

1394
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,982
And we must all six return.

1395
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,850
He says our power is as a group.

[non-english speech]

1397
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:39,028
It's a tunnel!

1398
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:00,449
Funny.

1399
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:01,550
The compass is going wild.

1400
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,786
Perhaps some volcanic
or seismic disturbance?

[non-english speech]

1402
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:11,560
Without the compass,
Challenger, how can we

1403
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,196
find our way out of this place?

1404
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:14,330
Oh, come now, Summerlee.

1405
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,999
I'm sure the chief
knows the way.

1406
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,770
I think we're going
around in circles.

1407
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,106
Oh, do shut up, Summerlee.

1408
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,696
- What about over there?
- Malu, are we lost?

1409
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:51,534
Huh?

1410
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,036
He hasn't been this
way for many years.

[non-english speech]

1412
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,945
This way, Summerlee.

1413
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:03,946
Don't get lost.

1414
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:05,048
Come on.

1415
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:12,121
Good heavens.

[non-english speech]

1417
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:30,406
Should have had a circus
training for this, Summerlee.

1418
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,778
So at your university,
I suppose anything went.

1419
01:23:35,878 --> 01:23:37,080
Thanks.

1420
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,247
That's quite a load
you've got there, Jim.

1421
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:39,215
You want me to take
it for a while?

1422
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:41,284
No.
I can handle it.

1423
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:47,590
Due south again?

1424
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:02,171
Look over here!

1425
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,655
[non-english speech]

1426
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:21,457
What did he say?

1427
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,126
He said they
can go no further,

1428
01:24:23,226 --> 01:24:25,494
or they will be cursed
by their ancestors.

1429
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:27,863
[non-english speech]

1430
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,365
He says, do not
forget your vow.

1431
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:33,669
We shall not forget.

1432
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:53,021
It even smells
different down here.

1433
01:24:53,122 --> 01:24:54,590
It smells like home.

1434
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:57,293
Now, if you dropped a plumb
line from the top of a pyramid,

1435
01:24:57,393 --> 01:24:59,428
what you would have is a series
of right angled triangles

1436
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:01,264
to each corner.

1437
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:05,734
So it's quite possible that,
uh, Pythagorus was influenced

1438
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,170
by the Egyptian mathematicians.

1439
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,939
Because they were quite
clearly sterling engineers.

1440
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,309
Our canoes!

1441
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:16,011
Ha ha!

1442
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,780
And Pujo!

1443
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,714
Professor!

1444
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:19,682
Pujo!

1445
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:22,518
My good friend!

1446
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:23,719
Oh, Pujo!

1447
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:24,987
It's so good to see you!

1448
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:26,021
Where are the others?

1449
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,290
They are cowards.

1450
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,192
They hear strange noises
and see giant bat.

1451
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,092
They leave.

1452
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:31,360
I tried to stop them.

1453
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,729
But the faithful
Pujo remained behind.

1454
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:34,663
[gunshot]

1455
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:35,564
Get down!

1456
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:36,865
Take cover!

1457
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,667
Get down, Jim!

1458
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:41,237
GOMEZ: Challenger!

1459
01:25:41,337 --> 01:25:43,239
I knew you would return!

1460
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:45,841
Just as I knew I would
be here to meet you!

1461
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:47,176
Anyone see him?

1462
01:25:47,276 --> 01:25:49,111
GOMEZ: I do not want to
hurt the rest of you!

1463
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:51,214
I just want Challenger!

1464
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:53,916
All right, all of you--

1465
01:25:54,016 --> 01:25:55,050
put your guns down.

1466
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,619
- What?
- Do I say.

1467
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:57,553
Put your guns down.

1468
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,660
What are you
doing, Challenger?

1469
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,730
You've all risked your
necks proving my theories.

1470
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,633
I cannot endanger the lives
of my friends any further.

1471
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:14,303
All right, Gomez.

1472
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:17,673
Come out.

1473
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:19,174
Do your worst.

1474
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:20,676
[laughter]

1475
01:26:21,744 --> 01:26:23,312
There he is.

1476
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:27,950
Very large of you, Challenger.

1477
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,818
On your knees!

1478
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:32,488
Go to hell.

1479
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:35,558
Adios, Professor Challenger.

1480
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:36,959
[shouting]

1481
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:38,026
Look out!

1482
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:38,927
The gun!

1483
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:39,928
[gunshot]

1484
01:26:42,398 --> 01:26:43,966
Should I kill him, professor?

1485
01:26:47,002 --> 01:26:49,438
[screaming]

1486
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,775
No!

1487
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:55,711
No.

1488
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:56,912
Let the jungle have him.

1489
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:02,485
[whimpering]

1490
01:27:07,623 --> 01:27:08,424
Thanks.

1491
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,064
Goodbye, Edward.

1492
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,801
Do you want to go
back to England with us?

1493
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,436
My life is here.

1494
01:27:20,536 --> 01:27:23,071
I wouldn't be happy
anywhere else.

1495
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:26,742
And as you know, this is quite
a different world from London.

1496
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:27,676
This is my home.

1497
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:30,646
Edward.

1498
01:27:33,316 --> 01:27:35,351
I hope we meet again someday.

1499
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,291
Jenny.

1500
01:27:50,132 --> 01:27:54,002
A bit of Africa
to remember us by.

1501
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,605
Thank you, Malu.

1502
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:57,773
Oh.

1503
01:27:57,873 --> 01:27:58,707
Goodbye.

1504
01:27:58,807 --> 01:27:59,608
Goodbye.

1505
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,115
Sensational Challenger
meeting tonight!

1506
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,150
Papers!

1507
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,051
Sir!

1508
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:16,091
Thank you, sir.

1509
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:16,959
I say, what's
the meeting about?

1510
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:18,527
I can make no comments.

1511
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,529
All I can say, gentlemen, is
that you have the right place

1512
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:23,231
for a great moment in history.

1513
01:28:23,332 --> 01:28:24,433
Mr. Summerlee--

1514
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:33,776
Edward.

1515
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:34,777
Tarp?

1516
01:28:34,877 --> 01:28:35,911
How good to see you.

1517
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:37,045
Same here.

1518
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,814
I brought a friend
of yours along.

1519
01:28:38,914 --> 01:28:39,815
Mr. McArdle!

1520
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:42,451
Good to have you
back, Mr. Malone.

1521
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:45,821
Well, I must admit, you don't
look any the worse for wear.

1522
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:47,089
Thank you.

1523
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:49,257
Here they come.

1524
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:50,158
Oh, look.

1525
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:51,093
There he is.

1526
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:04,540
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished members--

1527
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,377
I stand before you tonight
with irrefutable proof

1528
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:11,980
of the existence, in
the heart of Africa,

1529
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,317
of the land that I discovered
more than a year ago.

1530
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:16,452
The lost world.

1531
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:23,459
Professor Summerlee has agreed
to join me on this stand

1532
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:24,927
to support my claim.

1533
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:25,928
Bravo.

1534
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,497
[applause]

1535
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:30,866
Bravo!

1536
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:37,773
Summerlee?

1537
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,543
Don't tell me he managed to
pull the wool over your eyes?

1538
01:29:40,643 --> 01:29:42,545
Your claims are preposterous.

1539
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:49,918
Professor Murray, perhaps
you would, uh, recap

1540
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:52,254
the evidence that we placed
before your committee

1541
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:53,756
this afternoon?

1542
01:29:53,856 --> 01:29:57,493
Professor Challenger, we
have examined the evidence.

1543
01:29:57,593 --> 01:29:59,361
Examined it very carefully.

1544
01:29:59,462 --> 01:30:01,229
And we find what
it proves nothing.

1545
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:02,431
Yeah.

1546
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:04,032
[crowd gasping]
- What a waste of time.

1547
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,133
What do you mean?

1548
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,134
What about the photographs?

1549
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,335
Easily faked.

1550
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:08,336
Well, what about
the reproductions

1551
01:30:08,437 --> 01:30:09,304
of the rock paintings?

1552
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,439
The skullasaurus tooth!

1553
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:11,707
You can't say
that that's faked!

1554
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,642
It just does not stand up.

1555
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,210
Not when what you claim is so--

1556
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,513
absolutely unbelievable.

1557
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:19,214
You're both men of science.

1558
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:21,517
Surely you realize
that the onus--

1559
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:22,885
the burden of proof--

1560
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,120
is upon you.

1561
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,121
You want proof?

1562
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:30,192
Maybe I can help you.

1563
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:42,805
What is he talking about?

1564
01:30:42,905 --> 01:30:43,972
No idea.

1565
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:47,442
On our adventure, I
made a very good friend.

1566
01:30:47,543 --> 01:30:49,478
I think it best that
you all meet him.

1567
01:30:53,348 --> 01:30:55,217
There's nothing
that can convince me.

1568
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:07,429
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished colleagues--

1569
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,364
let me present a
creature thought

1570
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,234
extinct for millions of years.

1571
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:15,103
Percival, a baby pterodactyl.

1572
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,071
No.

1573
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:17,472
No!

1574
01:31:17,573 --> 01:31:20,475
Come on.

1575
01:31:20,576 --> 01:31:23,045
[screeching]

1576
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,618
[applause]

1577
01:31:57,379 --> 01:31:58,681
Thank you.

1578
01:31:58,781 --> 01:31:59,882
This is amazing.

1579
01:32:02,785 --> 01:32:03,852
Nice to see you.

1580
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:04,853
Nice to see you.

1581
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:05,854
Take care.

1582
01:32:05,954 --> 01:32:08,657
Thank you.

1583
01:32:08,757 --> 01:32:09,625
Thank you so much.

1584
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:10,826
Thank you for coming.

1585
01:32:10,926 --> 01:32:11,827
Thank you.

1586
01:32:11,927 --> 01:32:12,795
Yes.

1587
01:32:12,895 --> 01:32:14,229
Would be for the
scientific testing.

1588
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:18,734
So then I said, well, what
do you think, Mr. McArdle?

1589
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:21,069
Do you think now you can
find a war for me to cover?

1590
01:32:24,607 --> 01:32:25,641
Jenny?

1591
01:32:31,513 --> 01:32:35,083
I hardly recognized you.

1592
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:40,055
Malu gave me this emerald
when we left Kalemie.

1593
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:42,791
It's beautiful.

1594
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,193
Miss Nielson,
at the age of 12 I

1595
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:50,198
wrote my first scientific
paper, on the metamorphosis

1596
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:52,200
of the butterfly.

1597
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,505
Your transformation outshines
anything I have ever seen.

1598
01:32:57,606 --> 01:32:58,774
Thank you,
Professor Summerlee.

1599
01:32:58,874 --> 01:33:00,676
It's a charming compliment.

1600
01:33:00,776 --> 01:33:03,912
Well, I propose
that we drink a toast.

1601
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:12,755
To the five of us, and
our absent friend, Malu.

1602
01:33:12,855 --> 01:33:15,958
Six intrepid
travelers, who risked

1603
01:33:16,058 --> 01:33:21,229
life and limb in the pursuit
of science and adventure.

1604
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,332
And to that special
land that we discovered.

1605
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,701
To the lost world.

1606
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:27,269
To the lord world.

1607
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:28,270
[clinking]

1608
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:32,607
Did you like them?

1609
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:34,576
Very large, huh?

1610
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:36,945
Can't wait to see him.

1611
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:39,481
Closing time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1612
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:42,985
The zoo will close
in five minutes.

1613
01:33:43,085 --> 01:33:44,252
Closing time.

1614
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:46,421
Closing in five minutes.

1615
01:33:46,521 --> 01:33:47,856
There he is.

1616
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:48,791
Percy?

1617
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,428
Percival looks very unhappy.

1618
01:33:53,528 --> 01:33:54,963
He must be.

1619
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:57,599
Alone in a cage all day long,
with people poking at him,

1620
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,634
and staring at him.

1621
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:02,437
I'd love to take you
home with me, Percy,

1622
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:06,208
but you'd probably
rather be free.

1623
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:11,146
You're not suggesting
we, uh, open the cage?

1624
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:12,915
We're all alone here.

1625
01:34:13,015 --> 01:34:15,383
Nobody need know who did it.

1626
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,652
Well-- I don't know.

1627
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:28,196
Hurry, Jim.

1628
01:34:31,633 --> 01:34:33,168
Come on, Percy.

1629
01:34:33,268 --> 01:34:35,170
[screeching]

1630
01:34:40,108 --> 01:34:40,709
Come on.

1631
01:34:40,809 --> 01:34:42,344
Percival.

1632
01:34:42,444 --> 01:34:43,678
Fly.

1633
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,413
This is your last chance.

1634
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,849
ED: Percy, get going!
