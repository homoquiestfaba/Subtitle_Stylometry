0
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:50,929
Belva!

1
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,833
Are you checking on Faye?

2
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,713
She didn't walk me to the store yesterday.

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,569
I know Mrs. Hamill, you've
already told me twice!

4
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,619
And the smell coming out
of her room can gag a maggot!

5
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,899
I know, I know, just
let me do my job, okay?

6
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Mm-hmm.

7
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,050
Faye!

8
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,519
Faye!

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,249
You in there?

10
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,083
Hey Faye!

11
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:30,569
The neighbors are complaining!

12
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,973
You gotta start taking
your trash out more often.

13
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,479
Faye!

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,759
Faye, I'm starting to get worried.

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,329
Nobody's seen you for a couple of days.

16
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,679
Old Mrs. Hamill,

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,699
she's driving me nuts
wanting you out here.

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Faye!

19
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,569
I'm going to come in now.

20
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,570
Okay?

21
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,503
This living like an animal
has got to stop, Faye!

22
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,220
Jesus Christ!

23
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,150
She is definitely a fighter.

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,490
It's amazing she survived at all.

25
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,799
I don't hold out much
hope for her to come out

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,097
of the coma though.

27
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,969
Heartbeat is strong.

28
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,869
We'll just keep her on the
iv and keep her comfortable,

29
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,099
for however long it takes
nature to take its course.

30
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,400
Of course, doctor.

31
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,401
Thank you.

32
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:38,436
Not now, Charlie, mamma's
tired, just five more minutes.

33
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:40,713
Mrs. King?

34
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,753
Dr. Armstrong, she spoke.

35
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,714
Who?

36
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,083
Mrs. King, the coma patient.

37
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,679
I was just bathing her
and she began to speak.

38
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,954
What did she say?

39
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:04,788
Was she lucid?

40
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,589
No, I don't think so,
because she called me Charlie.

41
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,819
It was more like muttering in her sleep,

42
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,589
but in case she woke up
I thought it was best

43
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,590
to have you here.

44
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,889
Yeah, it may have been nothing,

45
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,529
just a side effect of her condition.

46
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,799
But in the event she comes around,

47
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,609
I did want to be present, you're right.

48
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,199
Mrs. King, can you hear me?

49
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,713
Hey, what the hell?

50
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,233
Of course I can hear you

51
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,246
Hi,
Mrs. King, my name is-

52
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,632
- who are you people?

53
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,389
Calm down, Mrs. King,
I'm trying to tell you.

54
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,389
My name is Dr. Armstrong,
you're in hospice.

55
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,790
And this is your attending
nurse, Linda dermont.

56
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,253
What am I doing in hospice?

57
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,119
You were in the hospital
for the first few days,

58
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,670
then they transferred you here.

59
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,643
Days?

60
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:48,964
Yes, you've been here

61
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:49,917
for the rest of the week.

62
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:50,750
Oh, god.

63
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,333
Who's been taking care of my cat, Charlie?

64
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,099
What?

65
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,309
Say it!

66
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,209
I'm afraid your animal passed ma'am.

67
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,359
It was the smell of the cat
that caused your landlord

68
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,210
to enter your apartment and find you.

69
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:05,793
Poor Charlie.

70
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,140
What happened to me?

71
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,839
Why am I here?

72
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,349
You suffered a coma.

73
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,379
From a condition called
alcoholic encephalopathy.

74
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,049
It's a build up of ammoniac in the blood.

75
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,763
Apparently from prolonged,
excessive use of alcohol.

76
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,729
Prolonged, excessive
use of alcohol, yeah,

77
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,939
that's an understatement, doc.

78
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,113
But you're awake now!

79
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:31,393
That's a good sign.

80
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:33,189
It's a step in the right direction.

81
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,029
Let's see if we can make
you more comfortable.

82
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,604
Can you try and raise the bed?

83
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,605
Sure.

84
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,243
There you go, that's better.

85
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,479
I'd like to start off by seeing

86
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,619
if we can get a little food into you.

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,019
Bring some of your strength back.

88
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,199
Whatever you say, doc.

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,579
I'll be back to check on you later.

90
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,599
Linda will handle everything.

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,068
I'll see you when I'm on my rounds.

92
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:00,069
Okay.

93
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:16,158
God damn, I could use a cigarette.

94
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:43,219
They're not being
completely honest with you.

95
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,739
You know that, don't you?

96
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,290
What are you, one of the
resident care takers here?

97
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:50,969
No.

98
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,943
I'm only here when someone
is on their way out,

99
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,389
shall we say.

100
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,943
You see, Faye, these are your final hours.

101
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:05,063
I've heard of budget cutbacks
before, but this is insane.

102
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,773
I can't be going home
already, I just woke up.

103
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,509
I believe what my coadjutor

104
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,199
is trying to relay, Mrs. King, is that,

105
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,079
you're not going to recover from this,

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,529
and unfortunately one of
US will be guiding you

107
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,530
to the afterlife.

108
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,929
What is this?

109
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,813
Some kind of corn ball intervention?

110
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,279
An intervention would
do you little good now,

111
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,403
don't you think, Faye?

112
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,863
This is the end of your mortal life.

113
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,963
All that remains is to determine
where your soul is bound.

114
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,523
Get the hell out of my room!

115
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,999
Just woke up and already
in a mood, Mrs. King?

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,013
I'm sorry, but the doctor insists
you try and eat something.

117
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:53,796
I wasn't talking to you.

118
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:57,453
I was talking to that pale bastard.

119
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,299
I don't think I know
who you're talking about.

120
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:06,129
I'm not really that hungry but
I could sure use a cigarette.

122
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,169
I'm sorry, Mrs. King, but
there's no smoking at hospice,

123
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,769
not even for the staff.

124
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,449
So, there's no cigarettes
to be found around here.

125
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,849
But please, try and eat something,

126
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,139
it will make the doctor happy.

127
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,639
I'm not making any promises,
but I'll give it a shot.

128
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,209
I appreciate the effort.

129
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,210
Thank you.

130
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,767
So life didn't turn
out the best for you.

131
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,550
Did it, Faye?

132
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:50,199
I really don't understand the necessity

133
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,829
of these training exercises anyway.

134
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,929
Isn't your primary
concern disaster relief?

135
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,763
Oh, sweetie, come on.

136
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,559
I told you this a million times before.

137
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,769
We've gotta be prepared for anything,

138
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,763
that includes military actions.

139
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,083
Yeah, I know, but,

140
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,559
I just wish you'd be doing
something less dangerous.

141
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,699
I hate the guns.

142
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,600
Oh, you'd have me retire
if you could right now,

143
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:15,434
wouldn't you?

144
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:16,569
Well, yeah, maybe you
thought, should think

145
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,569
about staying home and
just doing the one job.

146
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,799
The bottom line right now, sweetie,

147
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,033
is that our son's college
isn't cheap, ya know?

148
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,608
Yeah.

149
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,989
Come here.

150
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,099
Listen, everything is going to be okay.

151
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,053
Enjoy everything and let it happen.

152
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,979
Because I'm in the reserves,

153
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,469
we're doing a lot better
than other people right now.

154
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,869
You're gonna have me all to
yourself, 24/7 soon enough,

155
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,719
and then you're just going to be begging

156
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,423
for a weekend to yourself.

157
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,060
That is never going to happen,

158
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:51,759
because I'm never going to
get tired of spending time

159
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,593
with you.

160
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:53,729
You sure?

161
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,269
Yeah, so can you just like
call in sick just this weekend?

162
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,159
And maybe go next month
when you're doing something

163
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,759
less dangerous, like

164
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,162
soup dishing exercises?

165
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh, sweetie.

166
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,036
Do you have any idea how many soldiers

167
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,969
are having this same conversation

168
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,749
with their husbands and wives?

169
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,529
If that was the case,
there would be no reserves.

170
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,726
I know, and I can't speak for the rest.

171
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:19,088
I'll just do my best to try
to convince you to stay.

172
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,212
Yeah?

173
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,213
Yeah.

174
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,811
And how's that?

175
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,229
Shut up.

176
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,735
I'm going to be back, I promise.

177
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:28,613
Okay?

178
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:29,446
You better.

179
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,446
I love you.

180
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,229
Disturbing and sad
news out of fort Luke.

181
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,860
Though full details are not released yet,

182
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:45,785
the military has verified
reports from earlier today

183
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,500
that a soldier has been killed during

184
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,220
routine maneuvers on base.

185
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,519
Oh, no!

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,609
The military maintains

187
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,239
this was an unfortunate accident
and not an act of terror.

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,739
Full details will be made public,

189
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,604
including the name of the fallen soldier,

190
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:03,444
once their family has been
notified of the accident.

191
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:04,566
Our thoughts and our prayers

192
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,643
are with the fallen soldier's family.

193
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:18,816
No, John no!

194
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,329
Where's my husband, John?

195
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,163
Where is he?

196
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:27,996
Mrs. King?

197
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:28,970
Yes, I'm Mrs. King, goddammit!

198
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,549
Where's John?

199
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,426
I'm sorry, Mrs. King.

200
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:33,535
There's been an accident.

201
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,914
Oh god, no, John!

202
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:38,020
Oh god, no, John!

203
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,679
I'm afraid this doesn't get any easier.

204
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,999
Let's get her inside.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

206
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:59,539
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

207
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,973
John said it was target practice.

208
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,479
If it was just a routine exercise,

209
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,733
how could he get hurt?

210
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:14,769
Target practice is a
very routine exercise.

211
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,259
But we do use live rounds.

212
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,203
So, we have to be really careful.

213
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,123
Another soldier, he was a new recruit.

214
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
His gun jammed.

215
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,943
So John came over to
help him clear it out.

216
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,493
During that process, the gun
malfunctioned and went off.

217
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:38,659
The bullet ricocheted off
the wall and struck John

218
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
in the head.

219
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,233
John was killed instantly.

220
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:52,909
Mrs. King, if there is anything, anything

221
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,939
at all that we can do

222
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,143
to make this difficult time easier,

223
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,853
just let US know, we
would be glad to help.

224
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,466
What my lieutenant was trying to say-

225
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,467
- my son.

226
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:10,143
Mrs. King, what do you mean by your son?

227
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,150
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,453
Excuse me, our son Todd.

230
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,533
He comes home from college in a few days.

231
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,393
And this news is going to destroy him.

232
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,499
If there is any way that
the army could be here,

233
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,403
to help me break the news to him.

234
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
It would,

235
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,839
it would let Todd know that his father's

236
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,085
life meant something.

237
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:56,403
That he was important.

238
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,206
Mrs. King, I understand that

239
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,309
but the military doesn't usually-

240
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,219
- of course, Mrs. King.

241
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,839
Whatever it is you need.

242
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,863
Just let me know when and
where and I'll be there.

243
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,099
Faye.

244
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:25,927
You had no blame in what happened to John.

245
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,806
Of course not, I know that.

246
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,073
It was an accident.

247
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,269
You had no way of knowing
that he was going off

248
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,049
to die that weekend.

249
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,050
Did you, Faye?

250
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:43,503
No, how could I have known?

251
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:47,749
What do you mean?

252
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,733
What do
you think I mean, Faye?

253
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,629
There's no way I could have known.

254
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,579
And yet, you tried so
hard to keep him from going.

255
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,623
Why did you do that?

256
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:02,952
Because I, because-

257
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,230
- had a feeling?

258
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,249
Maybe an intuition that John shouldn't go

259
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,350
to guard that weekend?

260
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,342
That maybe something bad might happen.

261
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,030
Perhaps if you'd only tried

262
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,883
just a little bit harder.

263
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,739
What the hell do you want from me?

264
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,959
I'm sorry, if you're up
to trying to eat something,

265
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,239
I can take it away.

266
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,289
I just thought maybe you
wanted a straw or something,

267
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,123
that's all.

268
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,939
I'm so sorry.

269
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,390
I could have sworn there
was somebody else there.

270
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,089
I'm sorry, maybe I'm not ready to eat.

271
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,709
I should just get some rest.

272
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,173
Yes, ma'am, you go
try and get some rest.

273
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,465
Thank you.

274
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,923
Oh, come on in, it's open.

275
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, crap!

276
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,860
Good evening, Mrs. King.

277
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:30,403
Afternoon, Mr. Paul.

278
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,809
What are you doing here?

279
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,810
You know, you can just call me Richard

280
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,399
if you like Mrs. King, and,

281
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,169
isn't today the 22nd?

282
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,869
If you say so, but why are you here?

283
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,879
The funeral is not going to be for-

284
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,239
- Todd, doesn't he come home today?

285
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,419
Oh, crap!

286
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,333
How could I have forgotten that?

287
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,839
I'm sorry, I've been so out of sorts.

288
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,369
I was just napping on the couch
when you rang the doorbell.

289
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,619
It's understandable, Mrs. King.

290
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,709
You've been through a lot
these last couple of days.

291
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,223
Gosh, I'm sorry, I,

292
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,819
I've been splitting my time

293
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,069
between Todd's room and the couch.

294
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,623
I just can't bring myself
to sleep in our bed.

295
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,939
But please, sit down.

296
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,979
Have a seat.

297
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,869
There is sodas in the fridge
if you get thirsty and

298
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,479
I really need to freshen up,
because, yeah, I look bad.

299
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,313
Of course, Mrs. King.

300
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,419
I'd be happy to wait here
and thank you for the offer,

301
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,300
but I'm fine.

302
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,769
Oh, you're very welcome and

303
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,749
if you change your mind, just
go ahead and help yourself.

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,583
I'll be right back.

305
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,583
Thank you.

306
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,073
What the heck?

307
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,843
Oh, Mrs. King, you poor woman.

308
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,147
Uh, hello?

309
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,789
Hi, you must be Todd.

310
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,340
Yeah, I'm Todd, that's right.

311
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,283
Who are you?

312
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:58,729
Where's my parents?

313
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,229
I'm sorry, I'm Richard Paul-

314
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,409
- oh yeah, you're my dad's
lieutenant in the reserves.

315
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,609
Yeah, that's right.

316
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,443
You know what?

317
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:09,109
You mom just stepped down
to freshen up a little bit.

318
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,439
I guess she thought she had
more time before you got here.

319
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,459
She had been napping on the
couch when I rang the doorbell.

320
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,059
The couch, that's weird.

321
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,260
She'd never let dad or
I get away with that.

322
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,463
So, where's dad?

323
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:22,822
You know what?

324
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:23,822
He's not here.

325
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,483
So, why are you here?

326
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:28,255
No, wait, don't tell me!

327
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,069
Dad is getting some kind of commendation.

328
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,189
He always tells me-

329
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,023
- Todd.

330
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:32,970
If you work really hard,
the right people will notice.

331
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,779
- And eventually, with time-
- Todd!

332
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,269
You can just move up.

333
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,989
That's what he always says: I do it,

334
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,289
and you should too, son.

335
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,290
Todd!

336
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,370
There's been an accident.

337
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,019
What?

338
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,649
I didn't want to tell you like this.

339
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,239
Your mom thought it would
be better if I was here

340
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,113
and the two of US told you together.

341
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,960
What are you talking about?

342
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,013
Where's my dad?

343
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,859
There was an accident on the base, Todd.

344
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,249
I'm sorry, but-
no!

345
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,083
No!

346
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,083
He's gone, Todd.

347
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,560
Oh, no!

348
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:07,561
Toddie!

349
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,387
Oh, honey.

350
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:13,142
Mom, dad is,

351
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,994
dad is dead!

352
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,914
Dad, he's gone!

353
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,165
I know, baby.

354
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,738
Oh my god!

355
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,859
Richie, what are you doing here?

356
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,579
I thought you were out of the country.

357
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,959
I was,

358
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,969
belva called me and told me

359
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,783
that she'd found you unconscious.

360
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:45,429
And that were in the hospital.

361
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,399
By the time I got home,
they had moved you here.

362
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,069
I swear, that woman
is more of a mother hen,

363
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,219
than an actual landlord.

364
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,986
Well, I'm glad she is.

365
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,959
You're the only family I've got left.

366
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,299
I had to come back.

367
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,449
Thanks for sneaking this in.

368
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,499
Oh, I didn't have to
sneak in, it's plastic.

369
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,380
It's allowed.

370
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:04,989
Hide it, before the nurse comes back.

371
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,850
Thank you.

372
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:06,859
You're welcome.

373
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,499
Regardless of how you got here,

374
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,219
it's really good to see you.

375
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,442
I was actually just dreaming about you

376
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,779
and how you came into my life.

377
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,613
That is kind of funny.

378
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,300
I was just thinking about that too.

379
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,489
Your dad was good man, Todd.

380
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,490
He was one of the best under my command.

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I know he was.

382
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:31,632
I just can't believe he's
actually gone, you know?

383
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,999
I thought being in the
reserves meant he'd be safe.

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,300
That something like this
just couldn't happen.

385
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,773
I know, and I am sorry.

386
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:49,709
You know, ever since the accident,

387
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,849
every morning I wake up, and I hope

388
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,593
this was all just bad dream.

389
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,863
I've never lost one of my people before.

390
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,020
And losing someone like your dad.

391
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:04,859
Well, it's been a powerful
blow to all of US who knew him.

392
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,783
I just don't know what I'm
going to do now that he's gone.

393
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,913
And I can expect the world feels the same,

394
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,539
emptiness.

395
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,113
Well, I need to get back to base.

396
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,349
And you get in there and
take care of your mother.

397
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,400
Yeah, you're right.

398
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:27,303
That's what dad would expect me to do.

399
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:32,491
You know what?

400
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:33,579
Here's my card.

401
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,369
I'm going to write my cellphone
number on the back of it.

402
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,493
If you need anything,

403
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
you call me.

404
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:41,635
You got it?

405
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:42,635
I got it.

406
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,752
Thank you.

407
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:50,843
You're welcome, Todd.

408
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:53,709
You're going to be okay.

409
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,360
You're a good man, like your dad.

410
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,779
Say goodnight to your mom for me.

411
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,249
I will.

412
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,750
You take care of yourself too.

413
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,730
Yeah, I will.

414
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:20,899
Oh, what are you doing, Richard?

415
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,150
You're getting yourself
in deep here, mister.

416
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,490
Captain Daniels is right.

417
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,451
You're just going to make
this harder on yourself.

418
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,129
You know you can't be doing that.

419
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,000
Doing what?

420
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,059
Showing some compassion to a family

421
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,079
that has just lost a loved one?

422
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,529
No.

423
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,580
Showing compassion is an admiral quality.

424
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,949
But you can't get too personally involved.

425
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,783
You're young and-

426
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,839
- sir, I'm 30 and I've made it to the rank

427
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,849
of first lieutenant as well.

428
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,049
Okay, let me finish.

429
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,822
So, you're young and
this is the first time

430
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:01,829
you've ever lost one of your own.

431
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,399
So,

432
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,779
each time that you have any interaction

433
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,089
with a family member,

434
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,489
it multiplies your grief by every time

435
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,690
that you deal with them.

436
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,279
What are you suggesting?

437
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,599
That I don't follow through?

438
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,939
That I don't keep my word to that woman?

439
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,319
No, of course not.

440
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Do what you said.

441
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,639
But use this as a learning experience.

442
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,199
This is the first time that
you've ever been on one

443
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,230
of these calls with the family.

444
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,479
And if the army has taught me anything,

445
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,048
this will definitely not be your last.

446
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,389
Yeah.

447
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,909
But you have to understand that you need

448
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,259
to distance yourself.

449
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,233
Or the sorrow that you have
will be way too much to bear.

450
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,499
Yeah.

451
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,149
It's all right, lieutenant Paul,

452
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,785
you're one of the good ones.

453
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,453
You'll be all right.

454
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,869
Well, I'm really glad to see you too.

455
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,399
Awake that is.

456
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,229
I've been sitting here
longer than I can say,

457
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,110
watching you sleep.

458
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,349
That's creepy.

459
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,679
It's good to know,
some things don't change.

460
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,609
Bedridden or not, you don't hesitate

461
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,010
to say what you're thinking.

462
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,999
Belva tell you about Charlie?

463
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,923
Yeah, actually I helped her Bury him.

464
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:20,700
Next to that big tree in the
back of the complex courtyard.

465
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,059
Oh, thank you.

466
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,673
He's gonna like that.

467
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,189
When he was strong enough to go outside,

468
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,019
he used to like sitting up in that tree,

469
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,413
watching those birds.

470
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,499
He wasn't fast enough to catch them,

471
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,100
but he sure liked watching them.

472
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,249
Are you okay?

473
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,329
Do you need me to call the nurse?

474
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,459
No, I'm fine.

475
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,378
I'd feel much better if I had a cigarette.

476
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,230
Uh-uh.

477
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,609
I thought you were giving those up anyway.

478
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,139
And you know.

479
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,519
Speaking of things I
thought you were giving up.

480
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,529
Belva and I cleaned out your apartment.

481
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,689
Oh, crap!

482
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,589
Oh crap is right, ma!

483
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,376
That place looked like a liquor store,

484
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:01,609
except all the bottles were empty.

485
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,443
What can I say?

486
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:03,669
It helps me sleep.

487
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,148
Yeah, well, this time your
sleep was almost permanent.

488
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,000
I know.

489
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,069
I tried to quit.

490
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,720
I even cut back a little, but

491
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,219
the clearer my head got, the
clearer the memories of John

492
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,933
and Todd got and it just,

493
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,529
it's unbearable, the heartache.

494
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,530
So,

495
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,403
I couldn't help it.

496
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:27,799
I just wanted to drown my sorrows.

497
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,799
Numb my feelings in the booze.

498
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,719
You gotta stop this, ma.

499
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,933
I can't keep losing
everyone that I care about.

500
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,899
You can't drink yourself to death.

501
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,609
I just couldn't deal with that,

502
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,093
after the loss of my
parents, and then Todd.

503
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:48,709
God, that's so awful.

504
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,850
I can barely stand the memory of it.

505
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:51,851
I know.

506
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,039
Phoenix memorial, third floor.

507
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
How can I help you?

508
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,610
One moment, I'll transfer you.

509
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Hello, how can I help you?

510
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:23,479
Yes, we're
here to see Todd king.

511
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,543
Okay, let me see if he's ready.

512
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,839
Oh no, I'm sorry, the doctor
hasn't yet released him

513
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,019
to see visitors.

514
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,999
So, if you just want to have
a seat right over there,

515
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,929
I'll let you know as
soon as he's available.

516
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,309
This is the only time that we were told

517
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,759
that he would be available to be seen.

518
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,229
And we both took off time to be here.

519
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,739
We don't get to see him that often.

520
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,759
Why do we have to wait?

521
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
It's okay.

522
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,969
It won't be that long, right?

523
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,619
No, it won't be but a moment.

524
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,409
He's been in there for quite a while now.

525
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,019
Okay, come on.

526
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
Thank you.

527
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:08,099
I don't understand why we have to wait.

528
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,263
I don't understand either.

529
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,879
But we've got to trust the doctors.

530
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,713
Why?

531
00:28:13,713 --> 00:28:14,713
They don't know anything

532
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,669
they're useless.

533
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,129
He should be at home with US.

534
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,644
Not with a bunch of people who
don't really care about him.

535
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:24,303
Richie, I know you're upset.

536
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,669
And this shouldn't be happening.

537
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,819
Not to US.

538
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,870
Not after everything we've had to endure.

539
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,623
It's not their fault.

540
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
You know if,

541
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,019
if Todd wasn't here,
we would have lost him

542
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,973
to pneumonia weeks ago.

543
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,639
Maybe so, but I'm not sure

544
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,723
this is what's best for him anymore.

545
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,619
Dr bullard, how is he?

546
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,299
Can we see him now?

547
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,732
He's weak, but he can
see visitors for a bit.

548
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:03,239
What about his lungs?

549
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,479
How are his lungs?

550
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,829
I'm afraid he's still retaining fluids.

551
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,999
We just don't know exactly how

552
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,213
to treat these new drug
resistant strains of aids.

553
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:16,840
When's the last time you got tested, son?

554
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:19,139
Just last week.

555
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,779
I've been going to an anonymous clinic

556
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,279
every couple of weeks,
just like you suggested.

557
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,979
This is crap!

558
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,813
You shouldn't have.

559
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,649
You should be able to
go to your own doctor,

560
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,883
you shouldn't have to hide!

561
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,449
I'm sorry!

562
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,729
I hate the military!

563
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,389
I hate it!

564
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,549
I'm sorry, Mrs. King.

565
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,789
I know this is hard,
but we've got to manage

566
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,969
the best we can with the
circumstances we've been given.

567
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,909
Maybe some day, things will be different.

568
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,499
I know, I'm sorry.

569
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,933
But we've got to survive today.

570
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,413
I know, you're right.

571
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,303
This is about Todd.

572
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,149
Why don't you take a
minute, splash some water

573
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,779
on your face and we'll go see him.

574
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,736
Okay, thank you.

575
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,320
I'll be right back.

576
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:17,236
Hi honey.

577
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,110
Ma?

578
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:19,360
Richie is here with me.

579
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,149
Hey buddy.

580
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,759
Dad's grave?

581
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,689
We went yesterday and
put fresh flowers on it.

582
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,199
I know how important it is to you.

583
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,320
We won't miss a Sunday, I promise.

584
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,497
I'll be home soon.

585
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,818
Makes me feel better, that
you guys will come visit me

586
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,102
when I'm-

587
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,019
- Don't say that.

588
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,909
You have to hang on.

589
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,360
They are going to figure
out a way to treat this.

590
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,899
You'll see.

591
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,093
Todd, you've got to take it easy.

592
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,609
You are not getting enough oxygen.

593
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,860
Speak a little at a time.

594
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,279
Richie and I were talking,

595
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,709
since your condition is not changing,

596
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,179
we thought maybe we would
get you some in home care

597
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,730
and take you back home with US.

598
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:26,114
- Faye.
- Sound good?

599
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:26,948
That's not a good idea.

600
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,139
It's critical that we keep him here

601
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,890
until we can control the pneumonia.

602
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,089
I wanna go home.

603
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,659
I know you do, baby.

604
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,060
And we want you there too.

605
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,370
We'll figure something out.

606
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:43,531
Todd, I need you to rest some more.

607
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:45,179
Can I speak to you in
the hall for a minute?

608
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,749
Sure.

609
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,583
We will be right back.

610
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:51,548
I'm going home!

611
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,414
Soon, Todd,

612
00:31:57,848 --> 00:31:58,848
soon,

613
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:01,727
you'll see.

614
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,319
Look, I know you two want to comfort him,

615
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,669
but I think it's best
that we keep him here,

616
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,073
so he can get the best possible care.

617
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:27,189
Yeah, but we could
get him a nurse at home.

618
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,849
Faye.

619
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,259
His condition is so frail right now,

620
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,810
he would not survive that trip.

621
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,169
Look, everybody knows he's
gonna die and there's nothing

622
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,908
anybody can do about it.

623
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:37,742
Richard!

624
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:40,199
But at least he can
do it at home with US,

625
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,569
the people who love him.

626
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,419
Not here surrounded by
a bunch of strangers.

627
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
We're doing everything we can for him,

628
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,149
but his condition is
gradually getting worse.

629
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,699
If we can get the fluid
off his lungs, I'd be happy

630
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,309
to send him home with you.

631
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,809
But I strongly advise against it.

632
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,739
I wasn't exaggerating when I said

633
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,340
he would not make the trip home.

634
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,710
Dr. Bullard, he is flat-lining again.

635
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:06,083
Go to the waiting room.

636
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,194
I can't have you in there when
we're trying to do our jobs.

637
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,699
Yeah, but he could
die and we should be in there.

638
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,283
Mrs. King, for Todd's sake!

639
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:14,323
But he's coming home with US!

640
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:15,324
Oh god!

641
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,993
Dr. Bullard?

642
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:37,911
I'm sorry, Faye.

643
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:40,397
There was nothing we could do.

644
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,398
No.

645
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:44,237
No.

646
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:46,537
Toddie!

647
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:49,162
Oh, no!

648
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:07,099
I just don't know what I
have to live for anymore.

649
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,833
What is left for me here?

650
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,833
I'm still here.

651
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,590
I know you are.

652
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:15,023
I'm sorry, Richard.

653
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,109
You just have no idea what
it's like for me to have

654
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,553
to get up every single day
and deal with that pain.

655
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,489
I just want it to be over.

656
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,933
Don't I know, ma?

657
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:28,971
You know,

658
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,349
there's something I need to tell you.

659
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,466
Something that I've, I've
hung on to, because it was,

660
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:38,649
well, it was just too
much for me to share.

661
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,053
But, I really think it's you knew.

662
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,393
Shortly after we lost, Todd,

663
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,873
I was gonna end it.

664
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,899
I had a gun in my mouth and everything.

665
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,350
I was gonna pull the trigger.

666
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,729
And then you called, and
then you made me promise

667
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,439
to come over the next day.

668
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:29,849
Hello?

669
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,532
Hi ya, Richie, honey.

670
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:33,033
How ya holding up?

671
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,743
Not so good, ma.

672
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,322
How are you doing?

673
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,365
About the same.

674
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:42,555
I don't know what I would've done

675
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:45,823
or how I would've gotten
through the day without you.

676
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:51,496
You know he loved you, right?

677
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Yeah, I know.

678
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:59,289
It was as mutual as it gets.

679
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,839
So I gotta take care
of you now, all right?

680
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
'Cause that's what Todd would've wanted.

681
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,943
Just like you did for
US, when we lost John.

682
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:10,855
I don't know, ma.

683
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,447
I just,

684
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:14,148
I don't think I can keep going on.

685
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:16,609
Sure you can.

686
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,383
Listen to me, you have to!

687
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:23,023
You're all I've got left
in this world now, Richie.

688
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,963
Without you by my side,

689
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,903
I haven't got a chance.

690
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,470
Can you, uh,

691
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,569
can you come by the
house tomorrow, please?

692
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,470
I've got something I want to show you.

693
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:43,112
I just, I don't know if I can.

694
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:44,639
Sure you can.

695
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,263
Listen to me, you have to!

696
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,803
You're all I've got left
in this world now, Richie.

697
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:52,999
Well, I'll see what I can do.

698
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,169
I gotta go.

699
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,003
No, Richie.

700
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,949
You gotta promise me first!

701
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,500
Promise me you'll be here
tomorrow, it's important.

702
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,089
Okay, okay.

703
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,923
Okay fine.

704
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:05,756
I promise.

705
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,756
Thank you.

706
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,799
I'll see you in the morning, Richie.

707
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,912
Try and get some sleep.

708
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:15,383
And remember, I love you.

709
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:19,318
I love you, ma.

710
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,213
Goodnight.

711
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:21,482
I'll see you tomorrow.

712
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:23,045
Bye.

713
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:32,163
If you hadn't done that, I-

714
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,583
- you never told me this before.

715
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,749
There was never a point.

716
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,819
And what's the point now?

717
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,419
To let you see how important you are.

718
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,159
If you hadn't stopped me that night,

719
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,893
I wouldn't be here now.

720
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,495
Sounds like some kind of emotional ploy

721
00:37:53,496 --> 00:37:55,962
to get me to stop drinking, right?

722
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:58,269
Well, uh, let's just call it

723
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,963
motivation to get better.

724
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,119
Have you had a nice visit?

725
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,539
Uh-oh, warden is here to kick me out.

726
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,599
Now, don't be like that, Mr. Paul.

727
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,629
I'm just doing what's best
for Mrs. King's health.

728
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,579
And doctor's orders are 30 minutes Max.

729
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,249
She needs her rest if she's gonna get out

730
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,563
of here any time soon.

731
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,080
I know, Linda, I was just joking.

732
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,379
I will see you tomorrow.

733
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,639
You keep getting better, okay?

734
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,740
And I'll see you then.

735
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,029
Thanks for taking care of her.

736
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,339
She's a lot more special
than you can imagine.

737
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,059
I can imagine.

738
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,629
You have a good night, Mr. Paul,
and we'll see you tomorrow.

739
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,620
You too, Linda.

740
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,453
Goodnight, ma.

741
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:38,699
Night, Richie.

742
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,753
I'll see you tomorrow.

743
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,753
Now, how are you feeling
after a nap and a visit?

744
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:47,759
Oh, god, overwhelmed!

745
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,289
Okay, not the answer I was expecting.

746
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,549
I was hoping for hungry.

747
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,629
Well, I could use a cig-

748
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,623
- Cigarette?

749
00:38:56,623 --> 00:38:57,456
Yeah!

750
00:38:57,457 --> 00:39:00,749
Yes, Mrs. King, I know,
but it ain't gonna happen.

751
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,519
How about some warm broth?

752
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,217
It will help you get your strength back.

753
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,609
Well, it's not a smoke,
but I'll give it a try.

754
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,379
Fantastic, I'll be
back in a few minutes.

755
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,380
Thank you.

756
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,410
It was nice of Richard

757
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:22,529
to come all the way back from Europe

758
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,283
to check in on you.

759
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:25,117
Oh, god.

760
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:25,950
You again.

761
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,320
So, where's your fancy friend?

762
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,490
He's never far behind.

763
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,539
I'm here, Faye.

764
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,373
Oh, god.

765
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:35,972
I was just being sarcastic.

766
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,599
I wasn't really asking for you.

767
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,619
Yeah, I realize that.

768
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,599
But you need to understand,
our business here isn't done.

769
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,333
How does what the soldier
told you make you feel?

770
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Where do you jerks get off
questioning me about my family?

771
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,259
Richie is a good kid.

772
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,849
And Todd?

773
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,223
Was he a good kid as well?

774
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:02,973
And were you okay with their relationship?

775
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,169
So tell me more about
the movie, was it any good?

776
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,789
Well, good is a relative term, I guess.

777
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,089
Yeah, Todd hated it.

778
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,929
I think hated is a bit harsh.

779
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,763
I just like a little bit

780
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,559
of dialog between explosions, is all.

781
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,459
Okay, if you say so.

782
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,359
Wow, since Todd and I have
pretty much the same taste,

783
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,299
it's probably not a
movie I want to go see.

784
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,289
That would be putting it mildly.

785
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,939
Well, if you don't mind, I'd
like to change the subject.

786
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,140
There's something I
wanted to ask you about.

787
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,029
Yeah, sure, mom.

788
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,109
What's that?

789
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,529
Well, you're graduating
in a couple months.

790
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,829
Have you given any
thought to where you want

791
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,019
to live when you get back?

792
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,990
I hadn't really thought about it.

793
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,659
I was just concentrating on graduating.

794
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,626
And then, I thought I'd come
back home and get settled in

795
00:40:51,627 --> 00:40:53,449
and just go from there.

796
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,473
Well, you know I'd
love to have you here,

797
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,729
but maybe it's time the two of you thought

798
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,311
about moving in together.

799
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,531
Mom!

800
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:07,390
Mom!

801
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,223
Well, come on.

802
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,159
It's obvious how you two
feel about each other.

803
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,748
You know what, maybe I should just go.

804
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:12,582
Richie!

805
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:13,415
Mom.

806
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:14,248
Todd.

807
00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:16,599
Okay, now that we've all
established who we are.

808
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,513
Can we just calm down for a second?

809
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,658
Please!
Yeah.

810
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:21,754
Yes.

811
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:22,588
I guess so.

812
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:23,588
Thank you.

813
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,656
Mom, please don't.

814
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:28,039
Oh, give me a break.

815
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,409
Just hear me out.

816
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,329
Do we really have to do this?

817
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,909
You know, when we lost
John, and we all lost John.

818
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,479
You became a really big part of our lives.

819
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,959
I didn't think I was ever
going to see Todd smile again.

820
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,899
And then when you started
hanging around, the light came

821
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,749
back into his eyes and this place,

822
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,299
oh come on, it actually feels
like a home again, doesn't it?

823
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,509
But ma, it's not like rich
and I can go out and get-

824
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,343
- what?

825
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,295
Married?

826
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:53,389
Maybe not now.

827
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,819
All I'm saying is you're
my boys and I love you.

828
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,423
You don't have to stand
on ceremony around me.

829
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,806
Life is too precious to not be who you are

830
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:03,629
and with the one you love.

831
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,149
That's all I'm saying.

832
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,709
I love you, guys.

833
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,023
You're family, that's all that matters.

834
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,149
Wow, I'm totally embarrassed.

835
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,400
I don't know what to say.

836
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:20,689
You know this is really
hard for me to talk about,

837
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,523
Faye, but-

838
00:42:21,524 --> 00:42:23,329
- call me, ma, like he does.

839
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,089
You're family now.

840
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,273
Okay, ma.

841
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,233
Anyway, like I was saying.

842
00:42:28,234 --> 00:42:30,969
This is really hard for me to talk about.

843
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,199
It's not something my parents
would have approved of.

844
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,659
Rich, you really don't have to do this.

845
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,609
Yeah Todd, I really do think this

846
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,023
is something I need to say.

847
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,089
My parents are gone now.

848
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,879
After I lost them, all
I had was my career.

849
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,393
That is until you guys.

850
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,779
Being in the military
makes it really hard,

851
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,479
but knowing we have your approval,

852
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,980
that really means a lot to me.

853
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,669
Oh, Todd, you can stop
giving me the stink eye

854
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,773
for outing you in front of your boyfriend.

855
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,669
I've known about you
since your first boyfriend

856
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,689
in junior high school.

857
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,523
Mom!

858
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:12,089
And your father knew, too!

859
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,969
You, my dear, are about
as subtle as an army tank.

860
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,563
Oh my god, mother!

861
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,449
I think John would be
happy for the both of you.

862
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,083
You know he's always liked
you very much, Richie.

863
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,850
I think I'm gonna be sick.

864
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,733
Oh, don't worry about Todd.

865
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,519
I'm sorry, he'll be back in a few minutes.

866
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,543
In the meantime,

867
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,510
you want a glass of wine?

868
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,798
Yeah, you know what?

869
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,799
I think I could really use
a drink right about now.

870
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,009
Grab that.

871
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,010
Oh, yeah!

872
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,803
Excellent.

873
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:55,762
There we go.

874
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:01,926
I'm making a mess.

875
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,439
Uh, to family!

876
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
To family!

877
00:44:07,924 --> 00:44:09,459
Of course I was okay
with their relationship.

878
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,469
Those two boys had a love most
people never get a chance at.

879
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,470
I see.

880
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,959
So you had no problem that their behavior

881
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,183
went against nature?

882
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,813
Against nature, my ass.

883
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,883
To hell with you!

884
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:28,619
Faye, there is no reason to get upset.

885
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,023
To hell with you too!

886
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,689
Who do you guys think you are,
coming in here and trampling

887
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,729
on the memories of my family?

888
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,499
Calm down, Faye.

889
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,923
I realize you must feel guilty
for failing Todd as a parent.

890
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,733
But this isn't about him, it's about you.

891
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,009
Guilty?

892
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,143
Well, yeah, of course.

893
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,409
That's why you're behaving
like this, isn't it?

894
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,163
If you hadn't condoned
their deviant behavior,

895
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,439
Todd might still be here right now.

896
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,339
Richie didn't give Todd aids

897
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,219
he must have got it when he
was in college or earlier on!

898
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,289
He actually did.

899
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,123
Well, then you know!

900
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:17,199
You know it wasn't Richie
that ended Todd's life!

901
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,900
That was never a question, Faye.

902
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,650
What we're discussing here

903
00:45:22,697 --> 00:45:24,853
is the guilt that you have over that.

904
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:29,449
If you and John had put an end
to this early on, this never

905
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,473
would have happened.

906
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:36,773
Todd's guilt or innocence
was never in question here.

907
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:42,189
We're just trying to come to
terms with your failure of him

908
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,190
as a parent.

909
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,013
So you can release that guilt and move on.

910
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,939
Good lord, Mrs. King.

911
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,299
I was only gone for a moment.

912
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,583
What happened to you?

913
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:06,023
I'm sorry, Linda.

914
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:10,489
I don't think I can eat right now.

915
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,539
I think I'm losing my mind.

916
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,879
Well, that's just too
bad, cause you're going

917
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,033
to have to try.

918
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:17,249
Thank you.

919
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,420
But, they were just here when I-

920
00:46:23,421 --> 00:46:26,169
- I'm sorry, Mrs. King, I'm
not going to hear of it!

921
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,889
You didn't eat anything yesterday,

922
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,689
and it's my job to make sure you get well.

923
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,090
Mr. Paul is depending on me.

924
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,269
And you told me you were going to try,

925
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,179
so I'm going to hold you to it.

926
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,110
Fine.

927
00:46:39,111 --> 00:46:40,283
That's more like it.

928
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,370
You're not really going to sit there

929
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,967
and watch me eat, are you?

930
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,679
Well, that's not exactly
why I'm staying here.

931
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,949
It just seems that every
time I leave the room,

932
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,963
something happens to get you upset.

933
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,579
So yes, I'm staying here while
you eat, but not necessarily

934
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,853
to keep an eye on you.

935
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,279
You don't think I hallucinate just

936
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,869
because you're sitting there?

937
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,059
Yes, if that's what it
is, that's what I think.

938
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,860
Because it never seems to
happen until I leave the room.

939
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,340
Well, either this is really good broth

940
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,109
or I'm really hungry.

941
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:24,569
It's probably the latter,
because it's just out of a can.

942
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,570
Okay.

943
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,989
So you want to tell me what

944
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,139
you think you're seeing whenever

945
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,140
I leave the room?

946
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,130
Not really.

947
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,920
It might help.

948
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:38,789
I doubt it.

949
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,883
Come on, Mrs. King.

950
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,449
Let me guess, you're going
to some kind of night school to

951
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,439
become a psychiatrist, right?

952
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,023
No, that's not it.

953
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,479
I'm very happy in my chosen career field.

954
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,036
I just know that it helps to
talk about things sometimes.

955
00:48:02,037 --> 00:48:03,798
Yeah, I doubt you'd
believe the crazy stuff

956
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:04,680
that I've been seeing.

957
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:08,079
Faye, you really think
doing the kind of work I do,

958
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,203
that I would be that easy to surprise?

959
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,660
I suppose.

960
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,819
Come on, humor me, please.

961
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,887
I think we both know, I've
just been hallucinating.

962
00:48:19,888 --> 00:48:21,429
Perhaps.

963
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,169
You do have a pretty good
amount of drugs pouring through

964
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,519
your system right now.

965
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,220
So there's a great chance of that.

966
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,160
What else could it be, right?

967
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,983
Oh, I don't know.

968
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,639
Others have told me things
that have stayed here before.

969
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,269
You mean people that have died here?

970
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,298
Some, and others that
have come pretty close,

971
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:47,469
but have stayed here for a while.

972
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,476
But regardless, they've told
me that they've seen things.

973
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:52,939
Yeah, but what kind of things?

974
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,889
I'd like you to tell me what
you're seeing because I don't

975
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,423
want to cloud your memories.

976
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,749
You see, they say near death experiences

977
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,759
can cause our minds to start
seeing things we weren't able

978
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,369
to see before.

979
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,133
And you came pretty close.

980
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,939
Any chance I could get a
cigarette out of this little case

981
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,989
study of yours?

982
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,990
Not one.

983
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:20,120
I was afraid you'd say that,
but I thought I'd ask anyway.

984
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:22,339
So what is it you want to know?

985
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,140
So, what is it that you're seeing?

986
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,232
It's not really a what, it's a whom.

987
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:32,509
So you're seeing someone,
what do they look like?

988
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,899
Two someones.

989
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
One is this

990
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:41,414
touchy-feely hippie kind of guy.

991
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,293
And the other one looks like
a big, black undertaker.

992
00:49:47,415 --> 00:49:48,415
I see.

993
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,710
The hippie guy is
kind of a cross between

994
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,410
a touchy-feely Mr. Rogers and

995
00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:00,103
like a prosecutor.

996
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,649
A criminal prosecutor.
And the undertaker?

997
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,569
Well, the first guy
really gives me the creeps.

998
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,563
The undertaker, he's fine.

999
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,040
He is precise and to the point and

1000
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,253
I think we both know
I'm just hallucinating,

1001
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,190
so-

1002
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,619
- so?

1003
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,829
It's not like they are here
to take me to the afterlife

1004
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,092
or anything like that.

1005
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:26,063
Is that why they say they're here?

1006
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,699
Interesting.

1007
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,213
Maybe they are, maybe they're not.

1008
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,549
What's that supposed to mean?

1009
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,800
You're not holding out
on me, are you, Linda?

1010
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,419
No, I'm not holding out on you.

1011
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,889
And yes, you're not
completely out of the woods.

1012
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:44,933
But that's not what I was,

1013
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:46,559
that's not what I was talking about.

1014
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,029
What I meant to say is that I
think I may know a way that we

1015
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,030
can find out.

1016
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:52,301
I don't, what do you mean?

1017
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,519
Find out if they are hallucinations.

1018
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,009
You mean find out if I'm crazy, right?

1019
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,219
No, Mrs. King, we're gonna,

1020
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,770
I'm trying to find out if
these are hallucinations.

1021
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,760
And how are we gonna do that?

1022
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,699
Well,

1023
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,313
I just lost my brother recently.

1024
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,959
I'm so sorry.

1025
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,569
It's okay.

1026
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,570
I'm dealing with it.

1027
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,379
Do you want me to ask
them about your brother?

1028
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,529
Yes.

1029
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,410
Seriously?

1030
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:27,849
Yes, if these are just hallucinations,

1031
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,203
they won't know anything.

1032
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,123
Okay, how did your brother die?

1033
00:51:35,355 --> 00:51:38,479
Well, let's see if you can
tell me that in the morning.

1034
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,829
Are you all done here?

1035
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,673
Yeah, I'm finished with the soup.

1036
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,979
But I think there is more than one person

1037
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,089
in this room that's crazy.

1038
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,723
Well, tonight is
your chance to prove that.

1039
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,159
Good night, Mrs. King.

1040
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,107
Good night, Linda, thank you.

1041
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:33,730
Well, you just keep turning
up like a bad penny, huh?

1042
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:34,881
'Till my job is done.

1043
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,400
I know I'm hallucinating
but this imaginary water

1044
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,863
is good and cold.

1045
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,869
I know it's hard to wrap
your mind around, Faye,

1046
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,019
but we're really here for you.

1047
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,919
Yeah, here to put me on
trial for what you view are the

1048
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,462
short comings of my life.

1049
00:52:57,463 --> 00:52:58,463
I didn't say that.

1050
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:00,769
Good god!

1051
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,569
I've had a crap life and I'm
at the end of it and you two

1052
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,273
show up and want to pass judgment on me?

1053
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,463
Piss off!

1054
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,370
We're not judging you, Faye.

1055
00:53:15,371 --> 00:53:16,871
Well, it sure feels like it.

1056
00:53:18,268 --> 00:53:20,779
We're just reviewing
the events of your life.

1057
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,459
So you can let go of any guilt that you

1058
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,593
might feel from them.

1059
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,679
And move on to where you belong.

1060
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,553
Relieve my guilt, for what?

1061
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:32,939
Not trying hard enough to stop my husband

1062
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,533
going out on guard, so
he wouldn't get shot?

1063
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,669
Or having my gay son pretend he's not,

1064
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,453
so he wouldn't die of aids?

1065
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,179
Yeah, something like that.

1066
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,399
Well, you're wasting your
time there son, because I don't

1067
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,219
feel guilty about those things.

1068
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,623
Does it kill me, that I lost them both?

1069
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,203
Hell yes!

1070
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,623
Do I miss them, every single day?

1071
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,570
Hell yes!

1072
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,340
Do I wish things would
have been different?

1073
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,030
Yeah, I bet you know the answer now, huh?

1074
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:16,639
But honestly, I don't feel guilty.

1075
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,173
If anyone's to blame
for this, it's you two.

1076
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,679
You certainly are
spirited when you're angry.

1077
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,773
Oh, so you think this is funny, huh?

1078
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,633
Well, if you two
supernatural jerks are real,

1079
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,789
you must get a real kick out of meddling

1080
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,323
in other people's lives.

1081
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:51,596
Oh, Terrence, why did you
choose the life that you did?

1082
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,973
You could have been anything
that you wanted to be,

1083
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,633
but you had to be a gangster, didn't you?

1084
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:18,950
Terrence dermont.

1085
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,453
Hello?

1086
00:55:26,454 --> 00:55:27,589
You have a collect call from-

1087
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,599
- Terrence dermont.

1088
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,259
Will you accept the charges?

1089
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,539
I will.

1090
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,373
Please hold

1091
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:33,670
and I will connect your call.

1092
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:35,917
Hey, Linda.

1093
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:39,329
Listen I tried to reach
mom, but I got no answer.

1094
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,829
I'm down at the county.

1095
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,179
What have you been busted
for this time, Terrence?

1096
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,729
Possession, but I swear, it wasn't mine.

1097
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,599
That cop put it in my pocket

1098
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,160
oh, Terrence.

1099
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:49,669
What are we going to do with you?

1100
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:52,659
You really think we'll
believe anything, don't you?

1101
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,183
Sis, it's not like that.

1102
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,769
I'm keeping it 100 with
you, like I said I would.

1103
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,029
But it's my squad.

1104
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,239
I think they're after me.

1105
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,919
They paid that cop off
to get me locked up,

1106
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,659
so they can get at me.

1107
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,224
Stop it, Terrence!

1108
00:56:04,225 --> 00:56:07,009
You can't reach your mother
because she is in the hospital

1109
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,049
having her gallbladder removed.

1110
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:12,869
And if you were any kind of
son, you would know that.

1111
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,979
But you don't give a damn
about anyone but yourself.

1112
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,859
Sis, don't get mad and hang
up on me, I'm in trouble.

1113
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,304
I need you!

1114
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:19,260
I'm not mad, Terrence.

1115
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:20,519
I'm tired.

1116
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,529
We're tired!

1117
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,309
We're all tired of your lies.

1118
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,699
I'm not lying!

1119
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,949
I swear on our mother's life, I'm not.

1120
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,744
I'm telling you the truth!

1121
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:29,059
Now you've gone too far!

1122
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:33,069
Especially now while she's in
the hospital having surgery.

1123
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,933
Or did you forget that already?

1124
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,199
I meant no disrespect.

1125
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,699
I just need you to believe me.

1126
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,079
I'm telling you the truth.

1127
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,379
I wish I could too, Terrence.

1128
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,289
But I'll tell you what.

1129
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:47,299
Why don't you think of a better
story to tell your mother

1130
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,249
when she gets out in a couple of days?

1131
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,419
And maybe she'll come down

1132
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,809
and bail your sorry ass outta jail.

1133
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,609
Bye, Terrence.

1134
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,460
No, sis!

1135
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,310
Sis!

1136
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:57,570
No, I swear, sis!

1137
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,982
Hello?

1138
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:30,409
Is this miss Linda dermont?

1139
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,069
Yes, this is she, but let
me stop you right there.

1140
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,739
Because I'm on my way out for
work and I don't have time for

1141
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,120
a solicitation call.

1142
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,809
Mrs. Dermont, this
isn't a solicitation call.

1143
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,999
I'm calling from the maricopa county jail,

1144
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,519
in regards to your brother Terrence.

1145
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,389
We've been unable to reach
your mother this morning.

1146
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,499
Do you know how we can contact her?

1147
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,349
As I told my bum brother,
Terrence, last night,

1148
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,349
our mother is in the hospital
having surgery and isn't

1149
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,079
reachable at this time.

1150
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,439
Furthermore,

1151
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,609
I don't care what crap
Terrence has gotten himself

1152
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,443
into this time.

1153
00:58:02,444 --> 00:58:04,920
He can wait until she's
available her own damn self!

1154
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,729
I don't think you
understand, Mrs. Dermont.

1155
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,116
What I don't understand is
how a jackass like Terrence

1156
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:15,229
can have someone calling from
a facility where he is locked

1157
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,819
up on his behalf.

1158
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,049
Is that good use of my tax dollars?

1159
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,591
He can just wait until-

1160
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:23,542
- There was an altercation
last night, Mrs. Dermont

1161
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,399
Terrence was stabbed and I'm
afraid he didn't make it.

1162
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,073
Oh my god!

1163
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,673
Oh my god, Terrence!

1164
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:41,537
If only I had listened to
you that night, Terrence.

1165
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:48,460
If only I wasn't so angry, baby brother.

1166
00:58:57,597 --> 00:59:02,342
It might have not changed
what happened to you,

1167
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:04,983
but at least you would've
known that I cared.

1168
00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:26,453
Well, looks like somebody
is back on solid food.

1169
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,259
Oh, you can blame that on Linda.

1170
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,003
She gave me some broth last night.

1171
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,079
And I woke up this
morning with an appetite.

1172
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,359
Well, I'll have to
remember to thank her.

1173
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,300
Where is she anyway?

1174
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:40,559
It's before visiting hours and
she is not guarding the door.

1175
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,719
You're safe for now.

1176
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,109
The girl that's filling in for
her said she's gonna be late,

1177
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,533
she didn't say why though.

1178
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,679
So, what are you doing
here so early anyway?

1179
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,279
Well, maybe without her bird dogging me,

1180
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,140
I can get away with

1181
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:54,349
longer than a 30 minute visit.

1182
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,599
I doubt it.

1183
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,313
They've got eyes and ears
everywhere around here.

1184
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:02,560
Well, then I guess I
should just get right to it.

1185
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,981
There is something I really
need to talk to you about.

1186
01:00:04,982 --> 01:00:06,599
This sounds important.

1187
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,223
It is actually, you see, um,

1188
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,089
well, I've decided to leave the
military and move back here.

1189
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,381
So, I will be home full time.

1190
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:18,149
Richie, you can't quit your
career, you love it there.

1191
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,379
You're not doing this just for me?

1192
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,519
Because if you are, I'm fine.

1193
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,250
Well, first off, we know
that's clearly not true and

1194
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:28,803
while that is a contributing
factor, that's not it.

1195
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,149
See, since I've been back
I've just, I've been looking

1196
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,887
at my life and I just realized it's time.

1197
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:38,969
As long as it's something
that you really want,

1198
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:42,659
and you're not doing this for
anybody else except yourself.

1199
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,939
It is, ma.

1200
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,759
Actually, my decision goes back
to something we were talking

1201
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,760
about yesterday.

1202
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,859
Really, how so?

1203
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:52,029
Well, remember how I told you

1204
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,569
that making me promise to come

1205
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,899
over the next day saved
my life that night?

1206
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,269
Yeah, I don't think I
could forget it if I tried.

1207
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,270
Well,

1208
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,889
it's what happened when
I came over that day

1209
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,989
that gave me the strength to go on.

1210
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,301
And it's, it's even effecting my decision

1211
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:08,822
to leave the military now.

1212
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,773
Oh, come on in.

1213
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,693
Hi ya, Richie.

1214
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,163
I'm really glad you're here.

1215
01:01:30,116 --> 01:01:31,672
I,

1216
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:34,059
I've got something I wanna show you,

1217
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,960
but I need to ask you something first.

1218
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:38,090
Okay.

1219
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,090
Did, um,

1220
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,933
cid Todd ever talk about
John having cancer?

1221
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,323
No, he, he never mentioned it.

1222
01:01:49,617 --> 01:01:52,367
Well, it was right around
when he was in high school.

1223
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,360
Um, John started having groin pain and

1224
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,940
we took him to the doctor and

1225
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:05,123
he was diagnosed with testicular cancer.

1226
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:08,070
Oh my god!

1227
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,160
That had to be awful for all you guys.

1228
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,513
Yeah, it was.

1229
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,779
But we got through it together.

1230
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,583
But it had a profound effect on Todd.

1231
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,033
Why did it effect Todd so much?

1232
01:02:25,761 --> 01:02:28,960
Well, we had him
tested, just to be safe.

1233
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,443
And he didn't have it, thank god.

1234
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,030
But it turned out he was

1235
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:43,143
genetically predisposed to
developing it later in life.

1236
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,463
It scared him so bad,
he had trouble sleeping,

1237
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,453
poor guy.

1238
01:02:49,454 --> 01:02:51,309
Well, that's an awful
thing for someone so young

1239
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,889
to have to go through.

1240
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,163
Yeah, it was.

1241
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,149
This went on for weeks.

1242
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,989
Then, all of a sudden, out of the blue,

1243
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,633
he was just suddenly over it.

1244
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,880
You mean, just like
that, he was just over it?

1245
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:08,774
Yeah.

1246
01:03:08,774 --> 01:03:09,774
Did he ever say why?

1247
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:12,529
Well, I asked him about it.

1248
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,969
He said he was afraid that he wouldn't

1249
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,293
be able to give US grand-kids.

1250
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:19,093
And,

1251
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,263
most importantly, one day,
he wanted to be a daddy.

1252
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,273
Did you and Todd ever talk
about starting a family?

1253
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:34,722
Oh, honey.

1254
01:03:38,412 --> 01:03:39,412
Well,

1255
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:44,377
one day, he was just fine, he got over it.

1256
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:49,783
And I didn't understand
why until yesterday.

1257
01:03:51,002 --> 01:03:52,889
I was going through
some of his legal papers

1258
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,200
and I came across this.

1259
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,630
That's it!

1260
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,133
What is this?

1261
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:10,253
It's an account, at a sperm depository.

1262
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,299
That's why he wasn't worried
anymore, he knew that he'd be

1263
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,533
able to be a father.

1264
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,660
Okay,

1265
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,309
I don't understand why you
are showing this to me.

1266
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,959
I'm not just showing it to
you, I'm giving it to you.

1267
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,059
That way, if you ever decided
that later in life you want to

1268
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,069
have Todd's baby,

1269
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,417
all you have to do is get a surrogate.

1270
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:34,313
This way, you've got an option.

1271
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:40,219
I don't know what to say.

1272
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,323
You don't have to say
anything, you're family.

1273
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:49,189
If you want to have Todd's
baby, this is a choice.

1274
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,740
You want to give me grand-kids?

1275
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:56,212
Thank you, ma.

1276
01:04:56,213 --> 01:04:58,189
Thank you for coming into our lives

1277
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,303
and for making my son so happy.

1278
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:08,191
It's okay, Richie.

1279
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,163
Richie!

1280
01:05:10,164 --> 01:05:12,619
Are you telling me what I
think you're telling me?

1281
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,089
Yup, after that first day

1282
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,259
that I visited you here in hospice,

1283
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,529
I started screening potential surrogates.

1284
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,939
I settled on one last night.

1285
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,559
I've already purchased an egg
from a bank and we're going to

1286
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,369
do the fertilization procedure next week.

1287
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:28,528
That's great, I can't believe it.

1288
01:05:28,529 --> 01:05:29,997
That's fantastic.

1289
01:05:29,998 --> 01:05:30,831
I'm going to be a dad

1290
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:32,312
and you're going to be a grandmother.

1291
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:36,311
Wow!

1292
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,459
Come here, give me a hug.

1293
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,289
I am so happy for you,
this is gonna be fantastic.

1294
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,349
What's with all the affection?

1295
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,099
Did someone win the lottery or something?

1296
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,849
No, this is much better.

1297
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,239
Richie just told me he is
going to be a daddy soon.

1298
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,809
That's exciting news, congratulations.

1299
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,689
What are you hopping for, a boy or a girl?

1300
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,459
At this point, I'm
just hoping for healthy.

1301
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,539
That's a great outlook and you seem

1302
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,239
like you'd make a great dad.

1303
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,110
What's the mother like?

1304
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,602
Well, thank you!

1305
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:05,159
The mother is fantastic.

1306
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,059
She's got a wonderful personality.

1307
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,009
She's in great health

1308
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,699
and she came with multiple
glowing references.

1309
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,179
References?

1310
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,403
You didn't buy a wife off the Internet

1311
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:15,660
or something, did you?

1312
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:18,659
No, no, Linda.

1313
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,979
He hired a surrogate.

1314
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,139
He's actually going to be a single parent.

1315
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,269
I see.

1316
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,626
Well, you're going to help
me out once in a while when

1317
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:26,109
you're well enough, aren't you?

1318
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,369
Of course, you know I
would do anything for you

1319
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:29,473
and your new baby.

1320
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,433
Okay, Mr. Paul.

1321
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,053
It's time for you to leave now.

1322
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,019
But I haven't even
been here 30 minutes yet.

1323
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,729
I know that and I won't even
dock you for your time when

1324
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,079
visiting hours start.

1325
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,823
But they haven't yet and Mrs.
King needs her sponge bath.

1326
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:47,299
Unless you're willing to help with that.

1327
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,449
Oh, that is my cue to leave.

1328
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,679
That's what I thought.

1329
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,640
I'll see you later, ma.

1330
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:52,849
Okay, bye Richie.

1331
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:55,383
I'll see you later and congratulations!

1332
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:59,723
I'm a little confused.

1333
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:05,563
Clearly, Mr. Paul isn't your
son, yet he calls you ma.

1334
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:10,529
And you're gonna help him
raise a child by a surrogate.

1335
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,589
What's that all about?

1336
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:16,369
Well, it's a really long
story, but I can give you the

1337
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,683
condensed readers digest version.

1338
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,023
See, Richie used to be
my son Todd's partner.

1339
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,023
And we lost Todd few years ago to aids.

1340
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:32,659
Todd's dad had testicular cancer and

1341
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,699
Todd was really afraid
he'd suffer the same fate.

1342
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,433
So he put his perm in a bank.

1343
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:43,509
Now Richie is going to be like
the parent of my grandchild.

1344
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,139
Oh my god, Mrs. King.

1345
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,309
People say I have a complicated life.

1346
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,589
You are living a soap opera, girl.

1347
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:51,623
Sometimes it feels like it, Linda.

1348
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,643
Sometimes it feels like it.

1349
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,233
So I heard you had some
breakfast, I'm pleased.

1350
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,169
And I know the doctor will be impressed

1351
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,803
when he makes his rounds later.

1352
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,299
I'm not surprised you heard.

1353
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,959
I was just telling Richie
that you've got eyes and ears

1354
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,223
everywhere around here.

1355
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,219
You know, I wish they'd
just let me take a shower.

1356
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,659
I feel like such an invalid
somebody bathing me.

1357
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,630
Me too.

1358
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,019
I have real sick people to take care of.

1359
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,849
The sooner you get your strength back,

1360
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,273
the better for everybody.

1361
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:32,729
So, why did you come
in late today anyway?

1362
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:35,629
Well, it's the third month anniversary

1363
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:36,803
of my brother's death.

1364
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,119
And every month on this day,
I go and put fresh cut flowers

1365
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
on his grave.

1366
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,103
Well, I'm sure Terrence
would appreciate that.

1367
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,033
Look, I need to ask you guys a question.

1368
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,600
We ask the questions here, Faye.

1369
01:08:57,783 --> 01:08:59,539
Yeah, well, if you want
any more cooperation from me,

1370
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,533
someone's going to give me a damn answer.

1371
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,889
Faye,

1372
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:08,089
until you Pierce the veil,
we're not permitted to reveal

1373
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,809
what lies there.

1374
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,489
All will be revealed in time.

1375
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:16,269
Fine, then you're
wasting your time and mine.

1376
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,770
Faye, that is not an option.

1377
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,389
Oh, now you're just acting like a child.

1378
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,490
We're not permitted to reveal your fate,

1379
01:09:26,865 --> 01:09:31,289
but perhaps we can find
some middle ground.

1380
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,313
Mr. Ash,

1381
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:35,510
you know our roles in this.

1382
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:41,803
And I know when to bend
the rules, Mr. Church.

1383
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,159
Learn to play the game
like a big boy for once.

1384
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,159
If I could interrupt your
bickering for a second,

1385
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,923
I just wanted to know something
about my nurse's brother.

1386
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,160
Terrence.

1387
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,739
That's a good start,
tell me about Terrence.

1388
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,929
Mr. Ash, this will not be permitted!

1389
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,573
Come on, live a little.

1390
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:18,319
Well, now that the cry baby
has gone off to tattle on me,

1391
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,780
let me see what I can recall
about Terrence dermont.

1392
01:10:23,544 --> 01:10:26,044
He really was quite the
bad boy for a while there.

1393
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:32,309
Then he tried to walk the
straight and narrow for a while

1394
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,983
and his past caught up with him
almost immediately, however.

1395
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:41,029
Although he kinda made it in,
just under the wire, if you

1396
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,030
know what I mean.

1397
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,450
So he made it into heaven?

1398
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,159
Let's just say he's having
a much better eternity

1399
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,513
than the guy that shanked
him in the showers.

1400
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,830
That's all I know.

1401
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,730
Was it right?

1402
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:05,910
Did it help?

1403
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,683
Yes, very much.

1404
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,053
Terrence called me from jail.

1405
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,893
He said that he had been framed.

1406
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,003
And that his life was in danger.

1407
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,373
But I didn't believe him.

1408
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,680
And he died.

1409
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,089
I was afraid that he was
spending an eternity suffering,

1410
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,333
thinking that I didn't care about him.

1411
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,133
Now you know he's in heaven.

1412
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:48,463
You know what else this means, don't you?

1413
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:52,200
No, what?

1414
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:53,900
If this proves that they're real

1415
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:57,919
and they told me that I wasn't going

1416
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,283
to leave this bed alive,

1417
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,483
I won't be going home.

1418
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,933
You have to tell Mr. Paul.

1419
01:12:07,686 --> 01:12:09,643
No, what good would it do?

1420
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,439
None.

1421
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,353
Besides, he'd just think I was crazy.

1422
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,439
Can we just keep this to ourselves?

1423
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,993
And Richard and I can have what
time we have left together.

1424
01:12:23,627 --> 01:12:25,229
You've got it, Mrs. King.

1425
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,359
Whatever you want.

1426
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,360
Thank you.

1427
01:12:27,361 --> 01:12:28,373
First of all,

1428
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,129
start calling me Faye.

1429
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,759
You've got it, Faye.

1430
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,193
Second, I need to ask
you a really huge favor.

1431
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,263
I certainly owe you one.

1432
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,943
Richie is a really good man.

1433
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,999
He lost his parents before
he came into our lives,

1434
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,133
so he's got no one.

1435
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,849
Can you look in on him from time to time

1436
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,579
after the baby comes?

1437
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,339
I'd be glad to.

1438
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:06,103
With Terrence gone, it's
just me and my mom now.

1439
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,699
I would be, it would be nice
to have a man to call on every

1440
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,883
once in a while.

1441
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,359
And I'll be sure to let him know that he

1442
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,079
and your grandchild,

1443
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,779
can be as big as part of
our family as he'd like.

1444
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,696
Thank you.

1445
01:13:24,697 --> 01:13:25,983
You know, it's funny.

1446
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:31,200
Wouldn't it, it'd just
be my rotten luck that

1447
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:37,930
when my life is over, I finally
have a reason to live again.

1448
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,859
That's how you ended up here?

1449
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,209
Yeah, pretty much.

1450
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,560
Because you didn't have
anything to live for?

1451
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:51,160
Yeah, I only left the house
to go to the liquor store or

1452
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,053
take my neighbor lady
Mrs. Hamill to the market.

1453
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:01,263
Some punks started hassling her,

1454
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,050
they know better than to mess with me.

1455
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,929
How is it that they
hassled your neighbor,

1456
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,313
but they didn't bother you?

1457
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,150
See, they only
made that mistake once.

1458
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,355
What do you mean by that?

1459
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,653
One of those little
punks tried to mug me.

1460
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:27,709
So I took out my nine millimeter,

1461
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,779
aimed it at his jeans,

1462
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,929
and told him I was going to
blow his balls out of his ass.

1463
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:34,547
Oh no, you didn't.

1464
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:37,769
I sure as heck did.

1465
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,159
What's so funny?

1466
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,787
You sound like some cliche
'80s action movie star.

1467
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,333
I guess I kinda did.

1468
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:53,609
Well, he must have been a fan
of that genre because no one

1469
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,842
ever bothered me after that.

1470
01:14:55,843 --> 01:14:56,730
You know what, Faye?

1471
01:14:56,731 --> 01:15:00,429
I think this is the first time
I've ever heard you laugh.

1472
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:04,089
To be honest, I don't
laugh very much anymore.

1473
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,889
I think Richard is the only one
that's ever seen me laugh in

1474
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:09,573
the last few years, or crack a smile.

1475
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,659
I'm going to go grab some
more towels, so we can get this

1476
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,219
bathing nonsense over.

1477
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,249
And Mr. Paul can come back in, okay?

1478
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,633
Sounds good to me.

1479
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:27,729
I thought you'd be gone a
lot longer after the way you

1480
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,419
disappeared the last time.

1481
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,713
No, we are here for you, Faye.

1482
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,119
No matter what, we're
going to keep coming back

1483
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,283
until our job is done.

1484
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,783
Oh, Christ.

1485
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,240
Not exactly.

1486
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:50,769
Ugh, what is it you two want from me?

1487
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:53,994
A decision has to be
made, time is running out.

1488
01:15:55,141 --> 01:15:58,169
"A decision has to be
made, time is running out!"

1489
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:00,963
Like I've got some kind of choice, right?

1490
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,327
Well, what do you think?

1491
01:16:04,328 --> 01:16:05,828
What do I think?

1492
01:16:07,473 --> 01:16:08,953
I think I've been beaten.

1493
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,553
I think I've been beaten for a long time.

1494
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:19,623
I can't handle anymore heartache
or anymore disappointment.

1495
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:25,039
This feels like the final
kick in the guts, you know?

1496
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,299
To find out you're going to
have a grandchild, and you can't

1497
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,013
watch it grow up, and you
can't watch it be born.

1498
01:16:30,982 --> 01:16:32,663
I just want this to be over.

1499
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,683
So tell me what you want
me to say and I'll say it.

1500
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,749
So, does that mean that you

1501
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,473
believe you are beyond redemption?

1502
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,620
Does it matter what I believe?

1503
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:52,859
Is spending the second half
of your life drinking yourself

1504
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:55,553
to death and keeping a
cat with leukemia alive,

1505
01:16:56,938 --> 01:16:58,903
worthy of the damnation of hell fire?

1506
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,370
Isn't it though?

1507
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:08,526
Who would you like to go with?

1508
01:17:08,527 --> 01:17:11,273
Again, what does it matter what I want?

1509
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,453
If you had a choice,

1510
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,860
who would you choose to
guide you to the afterlife?

1511
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,159
Shame on you, Mr. Ash, for
deceiving her and making her

1512
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,140
think she had a choice.

1513
01:17:32,141 --> 01:17:34,916
She was always intended to come with me.

1514
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,679
But you saw her!

1515
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,849
She wanted to come with me!

1516
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,153
She took my hand!

1517
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:44,639
You suffered greatly in life,

1518
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,209
but even when you could no
longer care for yourself,

1519
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,433
you still looked out for others.

1520
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,306
Faye, you belong in heaven.

1521
01:17:51,307 --> 01:17:53,393
You just couldn't see so for yourself.

1522
01:17:55,059 --> 01:17:57,990
And as for you demon, you're done here!

1523
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:01,878
Now,

1524
01:18:02,798 --> 01:18:05,269
let's go see your husband and your son.

1525
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:06,874
Oh.

1526
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,599
We have
but to step into the light

1527
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,100
and then you'll be home, Faye.

1528
01:18:13,337 --> 01:18:15,193
Do I still have a choice?

1529
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,079
I'm not sure what you mean.

1530
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,549
Can I choose to stay?

1531
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,599
Would you choose to stay,

1532
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,769
knowing John and Todd

1533
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:22,770
are waiting for you?

1534
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:28,493
I finally come to realize
how precious life is.

1535
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,059
I have a lot more living
to do and now I'm needed.

1536
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,919
I think I made it
very clear on how I feel

1537
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,149
about bending the rules.

1538
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,959
I know you did, I'm sorry.

1539
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,209
I don't want to break the rules,

1540
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:42,393
I'm just asking if it's a possibility.

1541
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,049
But this is a one time thing
and I cannot say how long

1542
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:47,300
you'll be able to remain.

1543
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,580
Life is precious and I know that now.

1544
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:55,325
And you'll
take care of yourself?

1545
01:18:55,326 --> 01:18:56,326
I swear.

1546
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:00,747
Then go.

1547
01:19:06,468 --> 01:19:07,310
So, you gonna go dancing

1548
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:08,669
with me and the girls tonight?

1549
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:12,439
Oh, thanks, Linda, but I
got toddie junior tonight.

1550
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,469
We've gotta give Richie a night
off every once in a while.

1551
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,889
Yeah, what she really meant
to say there was grandma's

1552
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:19,299
kidnapping his son

1553
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,276
and forcing Richie to go out
and try and have a good time.

1554
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,059
So, where you going tonight?

1555
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,079
You know, honestly, I have no idea.

1556
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,869
I haven't been out in so long,

1557
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,449
but I'll figure something out someplace.

1558
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:32,870
If I don't, she's never
going to give me my son back.

1559
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,239
Well, I know some good mixed clubs.

1560
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,599
Why don't you come out with
me and the girls tonight?

1561
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,049
I guarantee you'll have a good time.

1562
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,849
And don't be giving me that
I don't dance line neither.

1563
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,609
Because I've seen you dancing around here

1564
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:47,185
with this baby of yours.

1565
01:19:47,186 --> 01:19:49,423
- Oh, I'm busted.
- She's got your number.

1566
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,900
Oops.

1567
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:59,029
Oh, can you take toddie
junior for a second?

1568
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,683
Absolutely, give me that handsome baby.

1569
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,854
I'll be right back.

1570
01:20:05,855 --> 01:20:06,688
Be a good boy.

1571
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:07,855
Be a good boy.

1572
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:20,400
So, where's the, where's the demon hippie?

1573
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:23,702
Oh, he's only allowed
around when, you know,

1574
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:26,229
a decision has to be made.

1575
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,749
It was your pain and regret

1576
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,503
that clouded your path to heaven.

1577
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:33,553
So why are you here?

1578
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,390
Are you ready to go?

1579
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,339
I don't think I'm ever going
to be ready, but I'm prepared

1580
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,983
to do what I'm supposed to.

1581
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:48,340
Your time isn't up.

1582
01:20:49,655 --> 01:20:50,488
I'm just checking to see if you're as

1583
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:51,488
good as your word.

1584
01:20:52,693 --> 01:20:54,411
So what do you think?

1585
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:55,274
How does what I think even matter?

1586
01:20:55,275 --> 01:20:58,829
Oh, so now you've developed sarcasm?

1587
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:01,259
I didn't think angels were
allowed to behave that way.

1588
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,605
I don't just think you're
alive, Faye, I think,

1589
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:06,813
I think you've finally
come back to life as well.

1590
01:21:09,133 --> 01:21:11,700
So, how long do I have?

1591
01:21:13,613 --> 01:21:16,527
You have as long as
you need and are needed.

1592
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:24,059
Do you say that to all the
people you bring back to life?

1593
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,260
Oh, I didn't bring
you back to life, Faye.

1594
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,313
That was all you.

1595
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,020
I just helped you see clearly.

1596
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,039
You had to figure out and understand

1597
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,640
if you had anything to live for.

1598
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:41,129
I think you're about to be paged.

1599
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,484
Oh, come here baby.

1600
01:21:43,485 --> 01:21:45,279
Did you give me this baby
because you knew he was about to

1601
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,747
mess his drawers?

1602
01:21:46,748 --> 01:21:50,779
Oh no Linda, it must be
something about you that brings it

1603
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,799
out of him.

1604
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,739
I change dirty diapers
on adults all day long.

1605
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,791
I don't need new experience.

1606
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,350
And what were you looking at anyway?

1607
01:21:59,351 --> 01:22:00,250
Oh, nothing.

1608
01:22:00,251 --> 01:22:02,343
Just appreciating everything around me.

1609
01:22:03,553 --> 01:22:04,810
Come on, stinky!
