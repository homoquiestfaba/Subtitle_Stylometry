1
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:03,457
Â™ªâ™ª

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,003
Girl: Isn't It Funny
How People On Tv

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:19,472
Lead The Most
Amazingly Perfect Lives?

4
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,207
Lucky Them, Huh?

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,846
Anyway, That's Me With
My Twin Brother, Eddie.

6
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:31,419
Can You Tell I'm Obsessively
Attached To My Camera?

7
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,753
My Dad Says If I Could've,

8
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:35,389
I Probably Would've
Filmed My Own Birth.

9
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:36,923
And My Friends?

10
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:41,061
They Love
Being In My Movies.

11
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:43,597
Come On, Just
Jump Up There And Do It.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,066
You Do It.

13
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:46,399
[Groans]

14
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:49,103
Denisey?

15
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:50,103
No.

16
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,204
Don't You Think

17
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:52,939
We're Getting A Little Too Old For This?

18
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:54,408
Come On.

19
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,910
You Two Would
Make The Perfect

20
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:59,846
Tragic Romantic Couple.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,650
Jakey.

22
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,754
I'm King
Of The World.

23
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:09,090
[Laughs]

24
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:10,925
Cut. Great.

25
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,358
I'm Not
Doing It Again.

26
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,359
Why Not?

27
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:15,763
'Cause We're
In High School Now,

28
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:18,899
And I Have A Reputation
To Protect.

29
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:20,100
Since When?

30
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:21,902
In Case
You Haven't Noticed,

31
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:22,903
Tru Won't Be Happy

32
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:24,537
Until She Turns
Her Entire Life

33
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,340
Into A Sitcom.

34
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:42,456
And Here's Another Thing:

35
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:45,225
On Tv, No Matter
How Gigantic Your Problems Are,

36
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,460
By The Final Commercial,
Everything's Wrapped Up.

37
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:48,763
Everybody's Happy.

38
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:50,331
Who Wouldn't
Want To Live Like That?

39
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:53,433
Yeah, But Talk About Totally Predictable And Boring.

40
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,435
Hey, Reality's Harsh.

41
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,671
I Would Much Rather
Live Inside The Tube.

42
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,493
[Chatter]

43
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:23,331
[Screams]

44
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,644
[Giggling]

45
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,951
Paparazzi!
Paparazzi, Tru!

46
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,285
Stop It Now, Eddie.
You're Gonna--

47
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,021
Paparazzi!
Paparazzi!

48
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,289
Paparazzi!

49
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:50,790
Give Me The Camera.
You Are Not A Paparazzi.

50
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:52,125
Paparazzi!

51
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,295
Stop It! Eddie!

52
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,962
Hey, Hey, Hey,
Stop It! Stop!

53
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,331
Knock It Off!

54
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:01,701
What Is Going On Here?

55
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,136
He Came
Jumping Out At Us,

56
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,405
Shooting This Thing
Off In Our Faces.

57
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:09,810
Uh, Maybe We Ought
To Take Off.

58
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,679
No. Come On. You Guys
Don't Have To Go.

59
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:12,646
Denise: No, It's Ok.

60
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:14,480
I'll Call You
Tomorrow.

61
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:17,317
[Sighs]

62
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,420
Ugh!

63
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,260
Mmm.

64
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:28,796
Mmm.

65
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:35,769
[Sighs]

66
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:37,671
Proud Of Yourself?

67
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:39,439
I'm Sure He Didn't
Mean Any Harm, Tru.

68
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:41,841
That's What
You Always Say.

69
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:44,077
I Only Wanted
To Be Funny.

70
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,547
Well, You Weren't, Ok?

71
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,615
I Mean, I've Got, Like,
Big White Spots In Front Of My Eyes,

72
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,017
And You Chased Away
My Friends, Eddie.

73
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:52,920
Can You
Say You're Sorry, Honey?

74
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,390
Sorry.

75
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,130
Forgive Me, Tru?

76
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:07,400
All Right.

77
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,036
Good.

78
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,603
Eddie, How About
You Go And Work

79
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,205
On Your Map Project, Huh?

80
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,507
It's In The Den.

81
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,049
[Clears Throat]

82
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,317
Why Do You
Have To Act Like This?

83
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,720
Me? If I Shot A Flash
Off In His Eyes,

84
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:28,288
You Would Ground Me
For A Month.

85
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:29,456
Yeah, Because
You Know Better.

86
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:30,491
So Does He.

87
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,593
Mom, You Let Him Get
Away With Everything.

88
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,929
Eddie Was Only Trying To Get Your Attention.

89
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:36,095
He Feels Left Out

90
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,631
When You're Here
With Your Friends.

91
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:39,399
So Whatever He Does
Is Just Perfectly Fine,

92
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:40,634
But I Can't
Do Anything Right?

93
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:41,768
Is That What I Just Said?

94
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:42,770
You Don't
Have To Say It.

95
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,070
It's Totally
All Over Your Face.

96
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,606
Tru.

97
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,606
Forget It.

98
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:47,141
Leave Me Alone.

99
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,992
[Applause]

100
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,633
Tru: Hi, Mom.

101
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,134
Oh, Honey.

102
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,636
I Don't Think
I've Had A Chance Today

103
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,871
To Tell You How Very
Proud Of You I Am.

104
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,239
Thanks, Mom.

105
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,275
Seriously, Tru,

106
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,112
You're Brilliant,
You're Adorable,

107
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:27,715
And You Have The Best Taste In Clothes.

108
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,518
Well, Then, Mom,

109
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,455
I Think You And Dad
Should Increase My Allowance

110
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,156
By $100 A Week.

111
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,093
Sure.

112
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,412
Ok, Here's The Deal.

113
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,049
The More I Wish My Life
Could Be Like A Sitcom...

114
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:05,251
The More It Turns
Into A Soap Opera.

115
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:07,588
I Mean, I Can't
Really Even Talk To My Mom

116
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:11,358
Because Not Only Does She
Totally Not Get Me,

117
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,494
But She's Always So Busy
Dealing With Eddie.

118
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:15,528
Then There's My Dad.

119
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:19,266
Do You Know He Actually
Operates On People's Brains?

120
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:21,769
Eww. That's How Gross?

121
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:22,936
Ech.

122
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,038
Anyway, He's
Hardly Ever Here,

123
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,773
And Frankly,

124
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,376
Sometimes I Think He
Likes It Better That Way.

125
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:33,112
Anyway,

126
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,614
Does It Seem
A Little Bit Psycho

127
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:36,384
That I'm Keeping
This Video Journal?

128
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,585
Not To Me.

129
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:43,190
In Fact, Here's 101 Reasons
Why I'm Doing It.

130
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:44,624
Reason One:

131
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:48,928
When I'm Incredibly Famous
And Have My Own Show,

132
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,263
I'll Put This Journal
Out On Video

133
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,698
So Everybody Can See What
My Life Was Really Like.

134
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,101
Reason 2...

135
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:58,272
In Case Foreign Agents
Break In

136
00:06:58,304 --> 00:06:59,572
And Drain My Memory,

137
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,509
I'll Still Have This Tape
As A Record Of My Life.

138
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,479
Reason 3...
[Sighs]

139
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:09,715
I Really,
Really Need Something

140
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:14,321
That's Completely
And Privately Mine.

141
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:17,156
Anyway, I Haven't
Actually Come Up

142
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,326
With Reasons 4-101 Yet,

143
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,295
But I Promise When I Do,

144
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,030
I'll Get Back To You.

145
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:29,903
Eddie:
Fork. Knife. Spoon.

146
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,971
Is Dad Home Yet?

147
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:32,506
No.

148
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:36,175
One Of His Patients Had Some
Sort Of Post-Op Complication.

149
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,579
Jeez. I Can't Even Imagine
Being A Surgeon Like He Is.

150
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,180
That's Why We
Have To Be Really Mellow

151
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:42,850
When He Gets Home.

152
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,785
What's For Dinner?

153
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:46,620
Chicken.

154
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:47,987
Twice-Baked Potatoes,

155
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:50,157
Broccoli.

156
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,129
No, No, No.
Tru, We Need.

157
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:56,463
No.

158
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:56,463
We Need--
Yes, We Do.

159
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:57,464
Eddie, We Don't
Need Those--

160
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:58,465
We Do Need 'Em.

161
00:07:58,497 --> 00:07:59,465
Miss Tar
Said That's

162
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,467
How You Set
The Table.

163
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,968
But Tonight,
We Don't Need Them.

164
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,037
Fork, Knife, Spoon.
We Need Them, Tru.

165
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,304
Eddie, No.

166
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,304
We Need Them.

167
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,273
Hey, Let Him
Set The Table

168
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:08,609
The Way He Wants, Ok?

169
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,109
Mom, It's My Night
To Do The Dishes.

170
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,445
I Don't Want To Have
To Wash Something

171
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:12,545
That We're
Not Even Gonna Use.

172
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:15,014
If It's Such A Big Deal,
I'll Do The Dishes.

173
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,149
That's Not The Point.

174
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:17,183
I Think The Point Is

175
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:19,653
You Want To Argue
About Everything Today.

176
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,689
You Know,
You're So Worried

177
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:23,957
About Not Hurting
Eddie's Feelings

178
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,593
That You Act Like I Don't Have Any Feelings At All.

179
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,034
Note To Self:

180
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,836
When I Do Make A Tv Show
Out Of My Life,

181
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:39,005
Remind Me To Cast Somebody Else As My Mom.

182
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,646
Reasons Why I Think
Eddie Might Be

183
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,516
The Most Well-Adjusted One
In Our Entire Family:

184
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,852
First, Eddie Would
Never Go Out Of The House

185
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:54,221
Without Bothering
To Look In The Mirror...

186
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,689
Like Some People I Know.

187
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:58,559
And Then What About The Way

188
00:08:58,592 --> 00:08:59,660
She Always Has To Ask

189
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:02,095
The World's Most
Embarrassing Questions?

190
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:05,431
Excuse Me. Hi.

191
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,900
Are These Tomatoes
Really Organic?

192
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,903
Or Do You Just, Like,
Put The Sign Up There

193
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:11,103
To, You Know,
Take Advantage

194
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:14,141
Of Environmentally-Conscious
Women Like Myself?

195
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:17,243
Tru: And You'd
Never Catch Eddie

196
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:18,778
Packing Left-Over
Chinese Food

197
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,113
And Chopsticks In My Lunch.

198
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,214
Oh, Check Out The Note

199
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:22,782
In Totally Fake
Chinese Writing

200
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,418
That Has The Translation
On The Back.

201
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:28,489
Could She Possibly Be
Any Cornier?

202
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:30,790
I--I'm Really Serious.

203
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,825
I Want To Know
If They're Organic Or Not.

204
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,468
Tru And Everybody
Came Home,

205
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,136
And I Was Really Funny.

206
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,472
Paparazzi! Paparazzi!

207
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,074
Remember, Tru,
When I Said It?

208
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,108
Papa-Who?

209
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,477
Tru: He's
Saying Paparazzi, Dad.

210
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,646
You Know, Like
Celebrity Photographer.

211
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,414
Paparazzi, Oh.
Paparazzi, That's Funny.

212
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,783
That Was
Real Funny, Huh?

213
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,783
Funny.

214
00:09:56,815 --> 00:09:58,117
It's Funny.
It's Funny.

215
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,620
It Wasn't Funny.

216
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:00,753
Mom, Could You Pass Me
The Broccoli, Please?

217
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,122
Mm-Hmm.

218
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,025
Thank You. Oh.

219
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,161
Oh! Not Again!

220
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,162
Mom: It's Ok, Honey.

221
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:11,897
Sit Down. I Got It.

222
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,299
It's Not As If We Can
Eat The Broccoli Now.

223
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,669
It's All Covered
With Glass.

224
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,271
I'm Sorry, Dad.

225
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,274

226
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,008

Hey, You Know What?

229
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:32,919
One Of These Days,

00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:34,154
We're Gonna Go Through
An Entire Meal

231
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:36,957
Without Dropping
Or Breaking Anything.

232
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,825
I Know
It's Gonna Happen.

233
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:39,825
Right.

234
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:42,161
Come On.
It's Ok. Sit Down.

235
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,777
Tru: Did You Know
It's Fairly Common

236
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:57,843
For Baby Sharks

237
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:00,146
To Attack Each Other
In The Womb?

238
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,183
It's True.
We Learned It In Science.

239
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,055
[Shark Belches]

240
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,055
Stop!

241
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,857
Tru: What If Everything
That's Wrong With Eddie

242
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,059
Is All My Fault?

243
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:16,163
Mom Says It's Not True,
But How Does She Know?

244
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:20,200
I Mean, I'm The Twin
Who Was Born First.

245
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,200
Maybe Everything Would've
Been Different

246
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,436
If I'd Let Eddie
Out Ahead Of Me.

247
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:37,751
My Twin Brother Has
A Developmental Disability.

248
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,753
Now That We're
Starting High School,

249
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:42,021
I Think It Would Be
Really Cool

250
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,190
If I Could Find Some Way

251
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:46,258
To Make Him More Comfortable

252
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,261
And Accepted In The World.

253
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:52,598
If Anybody Has Any Ideas
On How To Help Him Out,

254
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:55,167
I'd Really Appreciate
Hearing From You.

Tru: Can You Stand It?

258
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,234
Billy Meyer And I
Totally Connected.

259
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,436
He's, Like,
The Hottest Junior Ever,

260
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:04,804
And I'm Just
A Lowly Freshman,

261
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,807
But He Completely
Stopped To Talk To Me.

262
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,174
What'd He Say?

263
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,644
Hey, Kid, Is There
An Assembly Today?

264
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:17,117
Wow.

265
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,452
That Proves It.

266
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,387
He Has To Be
In Love With You.

267
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:22,856
It Means
He Knows I'm Alive.

268
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,125
Hey, Guys,
I've Got The Dirt On Something

269
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,126
You Are Definitely Gonna
Want To Hear About.

I Hope It's Not
About Billy Meyer.

271

What About Billy Meyer?

272
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:31,797
Nothing.
She's Delirious.

273
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,365
She Has No Idea
What She's Talking About.

274
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,635
She's Right.
I'm A Total Buffoon.

275
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,504
Aah! Don't Tell Me

276
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:38,704
You're In Love
With That Jerk.

I'm Not, Ok?

278

Do You Have News,
Or Don't You?

00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:43,310
Well, What'll
You Give Me For It?

If I Had Billy Meyer

I Was Psychic?

363
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:51,123
[Bell Rings]

364
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,093
All Right.
See Y'all Tomorrow.

365
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,939
Mr. Taylor,

366
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,608
I Told You About
The Wtuv Contest.

367
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:09,609
[Chuckles]

368
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:11,544
9 Or 10 Times
In The Last Few Days.

369
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:13,145
Well, I'm Doomed.

370
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,215
I Mean, I Really
Need Your Help,

371
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,316
'Cause I Want To Do Something Original And Great,

372
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,253
But Every Idea
I Come Up With Stinks.

373
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,722
What Do I Tell You Guys
When You're Writing?

374
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:23,823
Write What You Know.

375
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:26,959
Right. So Why Not
Apply That Same Concept

376
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:27,994
To Your Filmmaking?

377
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,795
Forget About Being Clever.

378
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:31,498
Go For Real.

379
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:51,985
Ginny, I Got
The Photo Layout For You.

380
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,286
Ginny?

381
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,688
This Is Strange.

382
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,989
What Is It?

383
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:59,125
I Was Looking
For Some Information

384
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:01,494
On Music Classes
For Eddie,

385
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,463
And I Came Across A Posting That Tru Put Up.

386
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,166
What Does She Want?

387
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:08,433
Help For Her Brother.

388
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,536
Really?

389
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,604
A Way To Make Him

390
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:14,174
Feel More Comfortable
In The World.

391
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:17,977
You Know, It Used To Be

392
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,945
When She Was Worried
About Stuff Like That,

393
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:22,314
I Was The One That
She Came Running To.

394
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:23,449
Not Anymore.

395
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:26,351
Sweetie, When You
Were Her Age,

396
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,720
How Often Did You
Confide In Your Mother?

397
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,524
Never.

398
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:32,958
You Know
This Is Different.

399
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,895
I Mean, She And I Have
Always Been So Close.

400
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:39,966
Now, It's...

401
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:42,768
All She Ever Does
Is Yell At Me.

402
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:46,705
Everything I Do Is
Either Stupid Or Wrong.

403
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,842
I Have No Idea
When I Turned Into

404
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,676
The Most Annoying Mom
On The Planet.

405
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,411
She's 14.

406
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:54,147
You're Lucky
She Hasn't Moved Out

407
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,681
Or Gotten Her Own Apartment.

408
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:56,683
Yet.

409
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:57,918
Mm-Hmm.

410
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:17,836
You Know What Sucks?

411
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,439
Don't Use That Word.

412
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,373
It Sounds Awful.

413
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,509
Do You Know What Stinks?

414
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,878
Having A Boy For A Twin

415
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,080
Means I'll Never
Get To Do Cool Stuff.

416
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:28,981
You Know,
Like In <I>The Parent Trap?

417
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,516
We Could Never Swap Dates

418
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,286
Or Take Tests
For Each Other.

419
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:35,220
We Can't Even
Fool You And Dad.

420
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:38,057
What's The Point
Of Even Having A Twin?

421
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,058
Shouldn't You Be Focused

422
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:40,560
On Finishing
Your Homework?

423
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,428
Ugh. Don't You Care
That I'm Being, Like,

424
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,096
Incredibly Profound Here?

425
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,364
Eddie: Look At Me.

426
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:46,532
I'm A Doctor Like Daddy.

427
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,534
Hey.

428
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:49,701
Want To See Me
Do An Operation?

429
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:51,237
We'd Love To.

430
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:55,742

432
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,044
Paging Doctor Eddie.

433
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:01,079
Paging Doctor Eddie.

434
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,381
Eddie: Broken Brain.

435
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,650
That Sounds Serious,
Doctor.

436
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:07,319
Shh. I'll Make You
All Better.

[Tru Screams]

438
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:10,123
Ow! No, Doctor!
You're Hurting Me.

439
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,457
Aah!

440
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:12,592
Rrr. Rrr. Rrr.

442
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,065
Aah!

443
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:21,701
Dad: What's
Going On Here?

444
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:26,640
I, Um...

445
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,507
Eddie: I...

446
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,643
It's All Right,
Eddie. It's Ok.

447
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:33,813
He Was Performing A Very Delicate Operation.

448
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,949
Eddie, Those Tools
Are Antiques.

449
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:38,484
They Were A Gift
From My Father.

450
00:21:38,516 --> 00:21:40,253
When Did We Decide
They Were Toys?

451
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:43,689
Mom: He's Being Careful.

452
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,625
I'm Not A Doctor.

453
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:48,328
Doctors Are Mean.

454
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,834
Dad: I Don't Know
What You Want From Me.

455
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,104
It's Like Everything I Do With This Kid Is Wrong.

456
00:21:58,137 --> 00:21:59,472
It's All About Your Tone.

457
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:00,473
Tone.

458
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:02,275
You Scare Him.
You Intimidate Him.

459
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:05,644
Well, At Least
I Don't Baby Him.

460
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,985
I Give Him Help
When He Needs Help.

461
00:22:12,752 --> 00:22:14,721
Look...

462
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:16,456
Unless We Start
Raising The Bar,

463
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,357
How Can We Expect Him
To Jump Any Higher?

464
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:20,192
This May Be It, Bob.

465
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:22,128
No, I Will
Not Accept That.

466
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,330
Each Of These Kids
Is Different.

467
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:26,732
There's No Rule Book.
There's No Handbook.

468
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,066
If We Get Lazy

469
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,468
And Quit Pushing Him,

470
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:31,004
He's Liable
To Stop Growing

471
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,037
Simply Because
We Let Him.

472
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:33,539
Yeah, But He's
Already Gone

473
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:35,574
Way Beyond
People's Expectations.

474
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:38,177
Nobody Thought He'd End Up
In A Mainstream School.

475
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,712
Exactly, So Why Not
Rewrite All The Rules?

476
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:42,748
As Long As We Don't
Lose Sight Of Reality.

477
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:45,352
Do You Happen To Remember What I Do For A Living?

478
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:48,020
I Face More Reality
Every Single Day

479
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:49,988
Than Most People Have
To Face In A Lifetime,

480
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,591
So I'd Really
Appreciate It

481
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:52,758
If You Didn't Lecture Me

482
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:56,730

Isn't What's Wrong

It's What's Wrong With You?

There's No Cure For
The Mentally Handicapped.

538
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:39,485
You Simply Need To Develop
A Strong Sense Of Faith.

Denise: Ohh, Man,
This Is So Exciting.

1258
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,395
I Might Throw Up.

1259
01:05:11,428 --> 01:05:12,462
I Mean, I'm Serious.

1260
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:15,531
I Might
Actually Throw Up.

1261
01:05:15,565 --> 01:05:16,600
Where Is Dad?

1262
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:18,301
Did He Not Swear That He Would Be Here?

1263
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,437
He Still Has A Few Minutes.
He'll Be Here.

My Patient
Just Got Into Recovery.

1280
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:49,498
I Have To Check On Him,

1281
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,167
I Have To
Talk To His Family...

1282
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,636
How Long?

1283
01:05:52,669 --> 01:05:55,004
Well, You're Gonna
Tape It For Me, Right?

Ok. Bye.

1289
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:08,084
We'll Tape It
For Him.

1290
01:06:08,118 --> 01:06:09,620
Already Ready To Go.

Look At Me!

1304
01:06:54,663 --> 01:06:57,033
That's Me On Tv,
Huh, Mom, Like Gilligan?

1305
01:06:57,067 --> 01:06:59,169
Only 100 Times
More Handsome.

1306
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:11,682
Ha Ha! Monkey Man
Attack! Aah!

1307
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:16,886

Eddie: Wow.

1313
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:32,268
Wow. Look At That!

1314
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:36,272
Ew. It's A Gross,
Disgusting Spiderweb.

1315
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,508
No. Uh-Uh.

1316
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,045
It's Perfect And
Beautiful And Strong.

1317
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,118
Ginny: To The Side.

1318
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,587
Tru: You Guys
Are Doing Great.

1319
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,755
Certainly Are. Ok...

1320
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:53,056
There I Am,

1321
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:54,324
In All My Glory.

1322
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:57,393
That's Ok.

1323
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:57,393
Eddie: Oops. Sorry, Mom.

1324
01:07:57,426 --> 01:07:59,829
Everybody Makes Mistakes.

1325
01:08:00,897 --> 01:08:03,167
Yeah, E-E-E-Except God,
Though, Right, Mom?

1326
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,303
'Cause If God
Makes Mistakes,

1327
01:08:06,335 --> 01:08:09,605
Then The Whole World Will
Look Like A Kid Drew It, Right?

1328
01:08:09,638 --> 01:08:10,907
Right?

1329
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,713
If An Athlete
Gets Athlete's Foot,

1330
01:08:16,745 --> 01:08:19,749
What Does An Astronaut Get?

1331
01:08:21,918 --> 01:08:23,887
Give Up. What?

1332
01:08:23,919 --> 01:08:25,823
Missile Toe.

1333
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,828
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

1334
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:37,967
But Living With A Twin
Who Has A Mental Disability

1335
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,771
Isn't Always
The Easiest Thing.

1336
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:45,475
Eddie, Put My Camera Down.

1337
01:08:45,508 --> 01:08:47,144
Come Here. That's Mine.

1338
01:08:45,508 --> 01:08:47,144
Eddie: Hi, Tru!

1339
01:08:47,177 --> 01:08:48,645
Give It To Me Now.

1340
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:50,247
Eddie, Put It Back, Eddie.

1341
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,115
Let's Get
The Candy, Too, Ok?

1342
01:08:52,147 --> 01:08:53,115
Eddie, No.

1343
01:08:53,149 --> 01:08:54,484
Clerk: Will You
Hurry Up Here?

1344
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:55,786
Let's Get The Candy.

1345
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:55,786
Is This Gonna
Be Everything Or--

1346
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:57,154
No. The Candy, Too.

1347
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:57,154
No. We Are Done.
Thank You.

1348
01:08:57,186 --> 01:08:58,622
Tru, I Want
To Get The Candy!

1349
01:08:58,655 --> 01:09:01,458
No, Eddie, Come On.
Please.

1350
01:08:58,655 --> 01:09:01,458
Get The Candy, Tru!

1351
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,625

Calm Down.

1352
01:09:02,659 --> 01:09:04,761
I Want To Get The Candy.

1353
01:09:02,659 --> 01:09:04,761
Eddie, Drop It.

1354
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:07,263
Tru, Get The Candy!

1355
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:07,263
Turn Off The Camera!

1356
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:08,365
Let's Get The Candy, Tru!

1357
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:08,365
Clerk: Give Him
The Candy!

1358
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:11,802
Let's Get The Candy!

1359
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:11,802
I've Got A Line.

1360
01:09:11,834 --> 01:09:12,802
When Eddie Acts Like This,

1361
01:09:12,835 --> 01:09:14,436
I Know What
Everybody's Thinking.

1362
01:09:14,469 --> 01:09:17,140
How Could
You Live With Him?

1363
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:19,209
Eddie: Stay Up!

1364
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:21,210
Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

1365
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:22,445
Stay Up!

1366
01:09:22,477 --> 01:09:23,779
Please.

1367
01:09:23,812 --> 01:09:26,016
Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

1368
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:31,487
Stupid.

1369
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:33,156
Stupid.

1370
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:35,525
Stupid! Kite's Stupid.
[Sobs]

1371
01:09:35,557 --> 01:09:38,328
Stupid Kite.

1372
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,930
It Must Be Retarded.

1373
01:09:42,832 --> 01:09:45,134
Tru: I Was Gonna Go See <I>Toy
Story 2 With Some Friends,

1374
01:09:45,168 --> 01:09:46,236
And Eddie Went--

1375
01:09:46,268 --> 01:09:48,538
I Mean, Combustible.

1376
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:52,508
Kicking, Screaming,
Flinging Himself On The Floor...

1377
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,812
And I Makes Me
Really Embarrassed

1378
01:09:56,846 --> 01:09:58,315
That He's My Brother.

1379
01:09:58,347 --> 01:10:00,516
[Whispers]
It's All Right.

1380
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:05,422
I Just Wish Other People
Would Take The Time

1381
01:10:05,454 --> 01:10:07,423
To Get To Know Him
The Way That I Do.

1382
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:13,396
Eddie: Hey, Tru. Hey.
Want An Apple?

1383
01:10:13,428 --> 01:10:15,198
Hey, Are You Sure?

1384
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:19,402
If--If You Want One, Tru,
Um, It's Right Here, Ok?

1385
01:10:19,435 --> 01:10:21,103
Right There.

1386
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:24,007
If You Ever Think You Ought To Feel Sorry For Eddie...

1387
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:25,107
Don't.

1388
01:10:25,141 --> 01:10:27,210
Because
He's Got More Joy

1389
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:29,580
Than Almost
Any Other Kid I Know.

1390
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,716
And Don't Feel Sorry
For Me, Either,

1391
01:10:32,749 --> 01:10:34,551
Because I've
Got A Brother

1392
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:36,219
Who, Every Single Day,

1393
01:10:36,252 --> 01:10:38,321
Teaches Me What's
Important In Life.

1394
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:53,136
Â™ª I've Been Waiting
The Longest Time â™ª

1395
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:58,374
â™ª For This Moment
To Come Alive â™ª

1396
01:10:58,408 --> 01:11:02,445
â™ª Now I've Started To See â™ª

1397
01:11:02,477 --> 01:11:07,449
â™ª When You Look At Me â™ª

1398
01:11:07,482 --> 01:11:10,052
â™ª That In Your Eyes â™ª

1399
01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:15,758
â™ª I Find A Secret World â™ª

1400
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,728
â™ª In Your Eyes... â™ª

1401
01:11:19,762 --> 01:11:20,630
Hi!

1402
01:11:20,663 --> 01:11:26,636
Â™ª There Lies
A Secret World â™ª

1403
01:11:26,668 --> 01:11:29,305
â™ª And Everything
Feels Right â™ª

1404
01:11:29,338 --> 01:11:31,674
â™ª When We're Safe Inside

1405
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:36,346
â™ª Of Our Secret World â™ª

1406
01:11:42,351 --> 01:11:43,619
Wow.

1407
01:11:43,652 --> 01:11:46,122
That Was Great.

1408
01:11:46,155 --> 01:11:47,691
You're Gonna Be A Star.

1409
01:11:49,158 --> 01:11:51,328
Big Humongous Star, Tru.

1410
01:11:56,531 --> 01:11:58,500
Pretty Impressive.

1411
01:11:58,534 --> 01:11:59,869
[Softly]
Yeah.

1412
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:02,972
Where Are You?

1413
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:04,341
You Noticed, Huh?

1414
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:06,109
Oh, Yeah.

1415
01:12:06,142 --> 01:12:08,311
Hazards Of
The Medical Life.

1416
01:12:08,343 --> 01:12:09,645
Mmm.

1417
01:12:09,678 --> 01:12:12,781
We All Become
Invisible Fathers.

1418
01:12:12,815 --> 01:12:16,018
Yeah. Some Of Us
More Than Others.

1419
01:12:17,152 --> 01:12:20,190
Wow. I Don't Believe It.

1420
01:12:20,222 --> 01:12:21,824
I Mean,
You Were So Out There.

1421
01:12:21,857 --> 01:12:24,828
Wasn't It Scary To Do?

1422
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,064
Yeah.
I Wonder What All The Other Kids Are Gonna Think.

1423
01:12:28,097 --> 01:12:30,567
Who Knows?

1424
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,502
Her Opinions Were Dumb,

1425
01:12:32,534 --> 01:12:34,069
All The Images
Were ClichÃ©s,

1426
01:12:34,102 --> 01:12:37,373
And Her Wardrobe Was,
Like, Completely The Worst.

1427
01:12:37,406 --> 01:12:39,008
If I Were Tru,

1428
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:41,177
I'd Drop Out Of School
And Move To Siberia.

1429
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:43,579
It Would Have Been
Much More Effective

1430
01:12:43,612 --> 01:12:46,082
If She'd Done The Entire
Program In Spanish.

1431
01:12:46,115 --> 01:12:47,484
Of Course,
She Could Never Stay Awake

1432
01:12:47,517 --> 01:12:49,419
Long Enough In My Class
To Learn.

1433
01:12:49,451 --> 01:12:53,155
A Whole 1/2 Hour
Of The Retard Twins?

1434
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:55,557
Pass-Adena.

1435

[Bell Rings]

1436
01:13:10,106 --> 01:13:11,408
I Saw Your Show, Tru.

1437
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:12,742
It Was Fantastic.

1438
01:13:12,775 --> 01:13:13,843
Thanks.

1439
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:16,612
Hey, Tru. Nice Job.
Really Impressive.

1440
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:17,714
Wow. Thanks.

1441
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:19,982
My Mom Cried
Through The Whole Thing.

1442
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:24,053
Hey, Tru. Hey.

1443
01:13:24,087 --> 01:13:26,490
[Applause]

1444
01:13:51,814 --> 01:13:52,781
Hi, Dad.

1445
01:13:52,815 --> 01:13:53,783
Hey, Tru.

1446
01:13:53,816 --> 01:13:55,718
Hey, Tru, Come In Here
A Second, Willya?

1447
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,987
I Want To Talk To You.

1448
01:13:59,622 --> 01:14:02,292
Ok, I Watched
Your Show Again.

1449
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:05,628
But If People Were Only Paying Casual Attention,

1450
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,198
I'm Not Sure They'd Even
Know You Have A Dad.

1451
01:14:09,432 --> 01:14:11,968
Sorry. I Tried
To Put You In More.

1452
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,969
But...

1453
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:17,207
Come On. What Happened?
Tell Me. I Can Handle It.

1454
01:14:19,976 --> 01:14:21,143
It's...

1455
01:14:21,177 --> 01:14:23,179
If I'd Used All
The Stuff I'd Shot,

1456
01:14:23,212 --> 01:14:24,948
I Know You Would
Have Been Really Mad.

1457
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:26,783
Oh, Come On.

1458
01:14:26,816 --> 01:14:29,553
Well, I Think You Have
To Show Me, Then.

1459
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:34,690
You Know, We Really
Don't Have To Do This.

1460
01:14:34,723 --> 01:14:36,025
Why? What Are
You Afraid Of?

1461
01:14:36,057 --> 01:14:37,793
Hurting Your Feelings.

1462
01:14:37,826 --> 01:14:39,161
Ha Ha Ha.

1463
01:14:39,195 --> 01:14:41,465
What'd You Do,
Draw Devil Horns On Me Or Something?

1464
01:14:42,464 --> 01:14:43,466
Come On.

1465
01:14:43,499 --> 01:14:45,468
Let's Let The Footage
Speak For Itself.

1468
01:15:02,517 --> 01:15:05,187
Bob: That Was Something
I Really Liked.

1469
01:15:06,856 --> 01:15:09,459
Aah! Unbelievable!

1470
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:11,960
We Can't Even
Get Through A Meal!

1471
01:15:11,994 --> 01:15:13,597
Sorry.

1472
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:18,835
Ok. I Lost My Temper.

1473
01:15:18,868 --> 01:15:20,837
That Happens.
What Am I, Perfect?

1474
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:24,239

01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,378
He's Gonna Get Me, Dad!

1478
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:30,379
Come On,
Come On, Come On!

1479
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:31,580
Does It Look
Like I'm Working?

1480
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,816
Dad!

1481
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,816
I'm Working Here!

1482
01:15:33,848 --> 01:15:35,150
What Do I Have To Do To Make It Clear To You?

1483
01:15:35,183 --> 01:15:36,252
Come On--Out!

1484
01:15:36,284 --> 01:15:38,253
Let's Go. Out. Out.

1485
01:15:36,284 --> 01:15:38,253
Sorry.

1486
01:15:38,286 --> 01:15:39,321
What Are You Do--
Are You Filming This?

1487
01:15:39,355 --> 01:15:41,191
Turn The Camera Off.

1488
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:46,362
Hi. It's Dr. Walker.
You Paged Me?

1489
01:15:46,395 --> 01:15:47,564
Eddie! Stop It!

1490
01:15:47,597 --> 01:15:49,199
Can't You See
I'm On The Phone?!

1491
01:15:49,231 --> 01:15:51,167
[Sighs]
I'm Working Now!

1492
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,803
Can I Just Get
5 Minutes To Myself?

1493
01:15:55,704 --> 01:15:59,042
Oh, For--Eddie,
What Is This Mess?!

1494
01:15:59,075 --> 01:16:01,010
Eddie, Pick Up
Your Clothes.

1495
01:16:01,043 --> 01:16:02,078
How Many Times
Have I Told You

1496
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,247
Not To Throw Your
Clothes On The Floor?

1497
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:08,951
It's All Like This?

1498
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:11,286
Pretty Much.

1499
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,822

You Weren't There.

01:16:18,727 --> 01:16:21,730
Dad, Your Job
Is Really Hard.

1503
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:23,266
You're Under
A Lot Of Stress.

1504
01:16:23,298 --> 01:16:24,633
Eddie And I
Know That.

1505
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:26,134
We Totally Get It.

1506
01:16:26,168 --> 01:16:27,971
That's No Excuse.

1507
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,308
You Deserve
Better Than This.

1508
01:16:33,976 --> 01:16:37,614
Ohh. What Do I Do Now?

1509
01:16:37,646 --> 01:16:41,116
Honey, I Had No Idea.

1510
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,819
I Mean, Who <I>Is That Guy?

1511
01:16:43,753 --> 01:16:44,754
Dad...

1512
01:16:44,786 --> 01:16:47,923
Eddie Loves Us
No Matter What--

1513
01:16:47,957 --> 01:16:50,093
Even When
We Make Mistakes.

1514
01:16:51,092 --> 01:16:52,628
You And Me And Mom,

1515
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:54,963
We're His
Entire World.

1516
01:16:54,997 --> 01:16:58,368
He Just... Loves Us.

1517
01:16:59,802 --> 01:17:02,304
Maybe All We Have To
Do Is Love Him Back.

1518
01:17:02,338 --> 01:17:04,507
[Whispers]
All Right.

1519
01:17:10,346 --> 01:17:11,513
One Click,

1520
01:17:11,547 --> 01:17:13,182
It's All In
The Recycle Bin.

01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:18,855

To Keep Me In Line.

A Tv Show Out Of My Life,

1525
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:36,238
Remind Me To Cast
Somebody Else As My Mom.

1526
01:18:20,682 --> 01:18:23,485
You Know, You Never
Had To Be Deedee.

1527
01:18:23,518 --> 01:18:26,789
All You Had To Do
Was Talk To Me.

1528
01:18:28,524 --> 01:18:31,061
You Make It Sound
So Easy.

1529
01:18:42,637 --> 01:18:44,106
You Know, It Wasn't
That Long Ago

1530
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,375
You Used To Tell Me
Everything.

1531

Sometimes More Than
I Wanted To Hear.

1532
01:18:53,816 --> 01:18:55,351
Just Because
I Don't Tell You

1533
01:18:55,383 --> 01:18:58,788
Every Intimate
Detail Of My Life,

1534
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,289
It Doesn't Mean That
I Don't Love You.

1535
01:19:01,323 --> 01:19:03,927
I Never Thought
You Didn't Love Me.

1536
01:19:05,895 --> 01:19:07,664
I Just Missed You.

1537
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:17,574
When I Was Making
My Movie...

1538
01:19:18,507 --> 01:19:20,476
Watching It Over
And Over Again,

1539
01:19:20,508 --> 01:19:23,078
It Really Hit Me.

1540
01:19:24,512 --> 01:19:26,615
You Know How
For So Long,

1541
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:29,919
Eddie And I Weren't Ever Really The Same,

1542
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:33,623
But, You Know,
We Played Monkey Man

1543
01:19:33,655 --> 01:19:36,625
And We Went Out
For Soccer Together

1544
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,127
And We
Goofed Around.

1545
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,329
You Grew Up Together.

1546
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:46,769
Only Now,
I'll Go To College

1547
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:49,272
And Probably
Get Married

1548
01:19:49,304 --> 01:19:52,275
And Have Kids...

1549
01:19:52,307 --> 01:19:55,777
And Eddie'll
Always...

1550
01:19:55,811 --> 01:19:58,181
Stay Eddie.

1551
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:06,522

Isn't A Tv Show.

I'll Survive.

01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,802
I Mean,
Just Because In Real Life,

1556
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:23,138
Things Don't Get
Wrapped Up Nice And Tidy,

1557
01:20:23,172 --> 01:20:25,308
It Doesn't Mean
They Can't Improve.

1558
01:20:27,008 --> 01:20:29,745
Dad Is Making An Effort
To Be Around More.

1559
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:33,883
And He's Trying
Really Hard To Relax.

1560
01:20:33,915 --> 01:20:37,520
Don't Let It Go.
Don't, Don't Don't!

1561
01:20:37,552 --> 01:20:39,555
I Said Trying.

1562
01:20:40,756 --> 01:20:42,691
I Mean,
To Quote A Mom ClichÃ©,

1563
01:20:42,725 --> 01:20:44,694
"Rome Wasn't Built
In A Day."

1564
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:50,365
And Mom Has Promised
To Be More Available,

1565
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:52,802
So We Can Talk And Stuff.

1566
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:55,404
And, Yes, I Promise
To Actually Listen

1567
01:20:55,436 --> 01:20:57,439
And Be Open With Her.

1568
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:02,812
And Eddie... Well, I Think
It's Safe To Say

1569
01:21:02,844 --> 01:21:06,716
That Eddie Will Always Be
Eddie.

1570
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:10,852
Come On, Mom.

1571
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:10,852
I Can't.

1572
01:21:10,886 --> 01:21:12,021
Eddie: Play
With Me, Mom.

1573
01:21:12,053 --> 01:21:13,388
No, I--

1574
01:21:12,053 --> 01:21:13,388
I'll Play With You,
Eddie.

1575
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:17,326
Eddie: Ok, Tru.
We're Gonna Play Tag.

1576
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:18,660
Tru: Go Eddie!

1578
01:21:23,632 --> 01:21:25,067
Eddie, Come On,

1579
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,270
We've Watched The Scene,
Like, 10 Times.

1580
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:28,603
Let's Move On.

1581
01:21:28,637 --> 01:21:31,407
It's Not Like
It's Gonna Change.

1582
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,174
I--I Like It.

1583
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:35,777
I Don't Want It
To Change.

1584
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:43,953
It's You And Me...

1585
01:21:43,985 --> 01:21:46,321
Being Twins.
