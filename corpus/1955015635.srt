00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:16,938
God, I still have nightmares

181
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,068
of being woken up
at 5AM by this thing.

182
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,238
[honks duck call]

183
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,281
I haven't had time to change
much since the funeral.

184
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,578
Just trying to organize
the store and...

185
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,581
- Yeah, I don't do funerals.
- OK.

186
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,118
Dude, this calendar is intense.

187
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,556
Yeah, well, nothing gets done
unless I write it up there so...

188
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,457
Ok and that...

189
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,019
that is creepy.

190
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,496
You gonna keep it'?

191
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,897
No, I don't know. I just...

192
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,595
I don't know
what to do with it yet.

193
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,201
How about that creek outback'?

194
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,966
You know he loved it up there.

195
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,836
Yeah... maybe.

196
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,039
Here.

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,377
We'll give you some time.

198
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,145
You gotta do it now.

199
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,350
It's on your calendar.

200
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,221
I have to do it'?

201
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,488
Oh yeah, I'll be long gone
by then, brother.

202
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,588
What?

203
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,295
I'm just asking.
This all seems kind of sudden.

204
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,860
Dude, there's no plan.

205
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,996
Why's there gotta be a plan'?

206
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,028
I wanted to spend some
time with my big brother.

207
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,302
That's my plan.

208
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,365
Well, what happened
to the money

209
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,035
I sent you two months ago'?

210
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,378
You know what, forget I asked.

211
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,575
I'll figure something out.

212
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,487
We should get
some apples tomorrow,

213
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,922
test out your juicer.

214
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,324
I've never actually
used one before.

215
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,659
You know what, I gave it
to the ex-boyfriends.

216
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,229
- The juicer'?
- Yep.

217
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,460
I don't have any storage, man.

218
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,489
Remember'?

219
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,058
I'm living out of my truck.

220
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,300
Besides, those two can
remember me when they're

221
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,204
juicing their bananas.

222
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,141
So you eat in here
all the time on your own'?

223
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,012
Yeah, it's comfortable.

224
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,642
Dad loved this place.

225
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,587
Always bragging
about his log cabin.

226
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,181
You're welcome to stay.
It's your house too.

227
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,021
I'm just...

228
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,323
the store's been slow.
I'm tight on money.

229
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,919
I can help out.

230
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,295
I did promos for the bar
for like a year, remember'?

231
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,027
- Oh God.
- No.

232
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,261
We get some gogo boys.

233
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,701
A beer bust!

234
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,063
Think about it.

235
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,572
We keep the whole
hardware store theme, right'?

236
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,040
Come on.

237
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,133
Construction zone.

238
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,939
Hard Hat Hotties.

239
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,639
Peligro, Peligro!

240
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,942
Sit down.

241
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,049
So funny you kept the bunk bed.

242
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,178
It's a loft

243
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,381
and I like it over me.
It's cozy.

244
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,288
That's so creepy awesome.

245
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,589
What are you doing'?
This is my room.

246
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,617
- You're in Dad's room.
- I'm not sleeping in there.

247
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm making the bed for you.

248
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,631
You sleep in there.
I'm not sleeping in there.

249
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,301
It's nice to be home
with you, brother.

250
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,115
[alarm buzzing]

251
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:36,928
Todd!

252
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,498
You're supposed to help out
at the store this morning,

253
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,134
remember'?!

254
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,777
I gave Ann the day off.

255
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006
I need someone at the register.

256
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,710
Tomorrow.

257
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,083
<i>I need rest.</i>

258
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,678
Come on, you said
you would help today.

259
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,247
<i>Get out or you're gonna
see some morning</i> Wood.

260
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,390
Hold on, Justin. I'm coming.

261
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,761
I got it. I got it.

262
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,493
Sorry. Thank you.

263
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,159
No problem. I'm here.

264
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,328
Kind of figured
this would happen.

265
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,100
I just think he needs
time alone right now.

266
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,560
Sure you don't want any'?

267
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,569
Yeah, I filled up
on junk all day.

268
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,239
It'll be in the fridge
if you get hungry.

269
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,124
Wanna talk'?

270
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,225
God, I don't even fucking
care about the relationship!

271
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,133
It was always
all about them anyhow.

272
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,638
I was fucking
the third wheel, literally.

273
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,699
Well, not literally.
You weren't actually a wheel.

274
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,232
What?

275
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,677
Sorry, just...

276
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,205
I'm just so fucking tired
of failing at everything, man.

277
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,844
- LA fucking sucks!
- You got distracted.

278
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,649
You need to get focused again.

279
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,657
God, lam so over being focused!

280
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,886
All I wanna do
is move to an island alone,

281
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,822
raise some chickens and,

282
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,557
I don't know, fuck the sheep.

283
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,622
OK, well...

284
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,497
Isn't that what you do,
up here alone'?

285
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,900
You fuck the sheep'?

286
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,903
You think I'm fucked up,
don't you'?

287
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,369
No.

288
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,144
I'm going to bed.

289
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,536
<i>(Chet) To be happy.</i>

290
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,665
<i>Find joy-</i>

291
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,908
<i>I could never think about that.</i>

292
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,772
<i>What did you want for me'?</i>

293
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,940
(Customer) Hello?

294
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,478
Yep. I'm coming.

295
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,519
Yeah, that's fucking hot.
You like that'?

296
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,723
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God, whoa.

297
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,924
Why are you doing
that down here'?!

298
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,729
The lighting is better!

299
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,769
No, no, no, no, no.

300
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,541
You can't leave the kitchen...
Jesus Christ!

301
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,705
Unfucking believable!

302
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,806
You just picked right up
where you left off, didn't you'?

303
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,406
What do you want'?!

304
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,418
- The kitchen is a mess.
- So'?

305
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,852
So, I'm not gonna
be your babysitter again.

306
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,614
Where are you going'?

307
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,628
- Put some clothes on!
- My underwear is out here!

308
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,858
Hey man.

309
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,699
What's up?

310
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,473
No, that's not the right...

311
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,042
Here, just wipe the counters.

312
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,855
Why don't you come to
the store with me tomorrow'?

313
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,655
It'll take your
mind off things.

314
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,991
There's a cute UPS guy
who comes around noon.

315
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,329
Really?

316
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,629
How cute'?

317
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,330
I don't know. Cute.

318
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,063
Fine.

319
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,469
But I get
to receive his package.

320
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,478
You're gonna miss
the school bus!

321
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,711
Coming, mother!

322
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,049
[cell phone vibrating]

323
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,085
You can't smoke in my truck.

324
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:56,684
You really think that's

325
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,423
an appropriate outfit
for school, son'?

326
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,897
It is if you wanna
get fucked in shop class,

327
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,456
Mom.

328
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,771
Alright, $9.18.

329
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,870
Todd!

330
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,574
Coming, boss.

331
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,343
He wears the pants, not me.

332
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,941
I'm flying free, man.

333
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,952
Vuelo libre!

334
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:29,082
So you wanna make sure
your pipe is properly lubed.

335
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,957
A good jelly
should work for that.

336
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,053
Something nice and thick.

337
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,760
You really have
to grease the opening.

338
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,892
I'm telling you.

339
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,836
He will fix the roof if you
help him drain the gutter.

340
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,135
Oh my God, you are so bad.

341
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,364
All right, the small is going
to fit you perfectly.

342
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,606
I'm thinking the hard hat,
the tool belt and yeah...

343
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,635
nothing else.

344
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,478
Uh huh, yeah, see'?

345
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,915
You got it.

346
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,022
Well, we did do good today.
I will give you that.

347
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,686
Just gotta know how
to talk to your customers.

348
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,388
You have fun'?

349
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,623
Yeah.

350
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,892
It was good to get out.

351
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,529
This place looks good.

352
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,040
A lot better than that
shithole Dad used to run.

353
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,406
Really?

354
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,411
Just needed a woman's touch.

355
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,948
Do you remember
Brandon Tillman'?

356
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,544
What, that closet case
from your soccer team'?

357
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,145
You think that he's...

358
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,815
Gay'?

359
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:37,156
You can say the word, right'?
Never mind.

360
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,162
Brandon Tillman.

361
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,561
Didn't you guys
like mess around

362
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,962
at your prom or something'?

363
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,593
- How did you know that'?
- Because you told me.

364
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,727
Remember'?

365
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,600
You were wasted.

366
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:51,631
That was the one time I held
your head over the bowl.

367
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,802
Well, he's back in town.

368
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,175
He wants to get
a drink sometime.

369
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,077
- Gay.
- No, I don't know.

370
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,672
- Gay.
- No,

371
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,580
all I know is that
he lives in New York

372
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,447
and he's just here for-

373
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:07,651
<i>[sing/song voice] Gay gay
gay gay gay gay gay gay...</i>

374
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,458
What's up, boys!

375
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,122
Hey Kingston.

376
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:17,875
What's going on...

377
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,130
Holy shit, little Todd Waters!

378
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,934
What's up, King'?
Long time no see.

379
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,032
What's up, city boy'?
How's LA treating you'?

380
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,703
- LA can go fuck itself.
- Yes!

381
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:28,233
Nice!

382
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,571
Well, welcome home, dude.

383
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,777
- There's my gays!
- Hey, Rachel.

384
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,182
Hey, Tucker.

385
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,586
- You're getting so big.
- Yeah, he's not the only one.

386
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,216
And look at you!
Nice ink, bad ass!

387
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,623
Still got your
vag pierced, Rach'?

388
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,888
<i>Hey, whoa, “me out.
How does he know about that'?</i>

389
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,486
Who do you think went
with her in high school'?

390
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,622
I don't know if I'm OK with you

391
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,892
knowing all about
my wife's lady parts.

392
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,990
Well, I'm sure
it looked a lot better

393
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,160
before it got
blown out by them kids.

394
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,227
Ouch!

395
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,808
Well, lam glad you got
Chet out of the house.

396
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,709
We haven't seen him
at a party in awhile.

397
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,738
Hey look, it's the
hardware store dude!

398
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,111
What's up, man'?

399
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,244
How do you guys live around
so many straight people'?

400
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,653
I'm fucking serious.
This shit is intense.

401
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>[chanting]
Drink, drink, drink...</i>

402
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,893
Just like old times, huh'?

403
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,593
Apparently.

404
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,831
So, he's pretty much
homeless at this point'?

405
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,599
And jobless.

406
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,165
Don't forget jobless.

407
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,870
[sighs]

408
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,944
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:37,946
I have had some experience

410
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,074
taking large objects
down my throat.

411
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,016
Anybody care for a demo'?

412
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,981
No, I'm serious.

413
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,252
They're out here every weekend.

414
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,987
You can't even
walk down the street

415
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,086
without tripping over
one of these yahoos.

416
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,653
I think they oughta tag them.

417
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,823
If you're from LA,

418
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,595
you have to turn in your
cellphone and wear a tag,

419
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,624
so we all know
who the hell you are.

420
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,636
Great idea, Hank.

421
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,639
Tag them like
the Nazis did the Jews.

422
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,867
And the gays.

423
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,138
I'm sick of them
coming up here,

424
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,771
taking over our campgrounds,
jamming up our roads.

425
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,974
I moved back to get away
from that bullshit.

426
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,277
Hank, you moved
back here because of that

427
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,808
sexual harassment lawsuit
at your last job.

428
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,615
That was a rumor!

429
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,880
Todd Waters'?!

430
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,890
Shit.

431
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,893
Oh my God,
what are you doing here'?

432
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,588
Oh, you know...

433
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,153
staying out of trouble.

434
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,860
Oh my God, we haven't
hung out in like forever.

435
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,802
- 11th grade. March.
- We should probably be going.

436
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,304
I heard you were in LA.

437
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,102
I love LA.

438
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,937
Quick, Hank, get a tag on him!

439
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,204
Look at all these.

440
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,835
You're so rock and roll.

441
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,040
Girl, you should
see me in my leather.

442
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,243
Wait a minute, what'?

443
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,842
What'd you say, man'?

444
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,648
Nothing. Forget about it.

445
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,120
You being a smartass'?

446
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,918
Yeah, Hank.
I'm being a smartass.

447
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,980
- Todd.
- What?

448
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,617
What's your problem, man'?

449
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:56,955
What's my problem'?

450
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,394
Well, let's see if I can
remember this correctly.

451
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,724
I told little Miss Melissa here
a secret a long time ago.

452
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,698
Ok, let's just go -

453
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,065
and then she proceeded
to tell her boyfriend

454
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,626
- and half the high school...
- I didn't...

455
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,695
and then her boyfriend
and his douchebag buddies

456
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,263
proceeded to beat
the shit out of me

457
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,299
and gave me this and this
so I would never forget.

458
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,072
I didn't know they
were going to do that!

459
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,205
Of course you didn't, sweetie,
because you're an idiot.

460
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,873
- Oh you're going down, LA!
- Whoa, whoa!

461
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,780
Hank, let's go for a walk.

462
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,977
Thanks Rachel.
Sorry for everything.

463
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,216
Don't fucking apologize for me.
I didn't do anything.

464
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,117
Just go, watch him.

465
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,819
And be careful.

466
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,823
No, just remember
where you are.

467
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,233
I'm not asking you
not to be yourself,

468
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,668
God forbid.

469
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,731
Well, myself tells skanks and
rednecks what I fucking think.

470
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:49,109
Oh! A little warning,
that is all I ask!

471
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,204
I'm probably gonna
beat off in here,

472
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,078
so there's your
heads up on that!

473
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,339
<i>No no, if he thinks
Pm gonna stay home.</i>

474
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,935
<i>While he's off hunting all day.
Don't touch anything.</i>

475
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,947
Hi! I need screws
for hanging shelves.

476
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,245
OK, drywall'?

477
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,377
That's what I told him.
No, just regular walls.

478
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,818
You got it.

479
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,253
They're driving me crazy.
The minute he leaves,

480
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,416
they turn into these
raging little monsters.

481
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,925
So you gotta get
the stud finder.

482
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,927
Unfortunately, that's not
what it sounds like-

483
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,792
Richard, enough with the doll.

484
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,126
This is your sister's toy.

485
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,257
Dolls are not for boys.

486
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,495
Whatever you suggest is fine.

487
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,035
Let me call you back.

488
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,337
They're being total brats.

489
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,139
OK, all right, bye.

490
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,347
How much'?

491
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,474
Let's figure it out.

492
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,746
Richard, what did I just say'?!

493
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,117
Where's your boy toy'?

494
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,053
[crying]

495
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,522
What are you doing'?!

496
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,192
It's a fucking doll.

497
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,888
You know, maybe he's gay.

498
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,395
You ever think about that'?

499
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,056
- What did you just say'?
- Is everything OK'?

500
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,225
Gay. When boys like boys.

501
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,427
It happens sometimes.

502
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,526
Like red hair.

503
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,465
Freaky but kinda cool.

504
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,130
Give me your hand.

505
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,070
You're gonna make
him feel like shit

506
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,539
about this now, aren't you'?

507
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,765
So he has to deal with that
for the rest of his life'?

508
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,243
You're crazy!

509
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:28,971
Come on.

510
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,843
I am never
coming in here again!

511
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,075
God, lady,
just give him the doll!

512
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,845
He'll have plenty of time
to play with the boy toy

513
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,511
when he's older!

514
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,347
Yeah, so this homeless guy
is seriously yelling at us

515
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:44,793
to help him
down these sandy stairs.

516
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,159
Central Park.
Middle of the day.

517
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,492
In the wheelchair'?

518
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,159
Yeah, down the stairs.

519
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,159
And he just goes for it and
we're trying to hold the chair

520
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,140
but it, you know,
has wheels on it so...

521
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,268
Well, I don't know
exactly how it happened,

522
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,142
- but he fell and...
- Yikes.

523
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,011
Terrifying.

524
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,380
And we're trying to help him up

525
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,805
but he doesn't
want us to touch him,

526
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,185
which is fine because
he smells like a landfill,

527
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,382
but he's bleeding from
the head and we're thinking,

528
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,856
"Oh my God, what did we do?!"

529
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,119
And we call the police

530
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,490
but he's already
hobbling into the chair

531
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,051
and wheeling himself away.

532
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,562
And he just...

533
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,031
well, he just leaves.

534
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,533
That was it'?

535
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,866
Yeah, never saw him again.

536
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,371
Could be dead, you know'?

537
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,601
We tried to get
him to stay but...

538
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,103
Wow.

539
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,441
Yeah. That's New York for you.

540
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:39,175
No, but you'd love it.

541
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,724
I don't know why
I told you that story.

542
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,911
I don't know why you
told me that story either.

543
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:48,948
So, wait, you've
lived here all your life'?

544
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,961
I went to college in Sacramento

545
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,361
for a couple of years

546
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:58,231
but... Dad really
needed my help so...

547
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,167
So you really like it here'?

548
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,636
Yeah...

549
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,998
I don't know.

550
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,507
It is what it is.

551
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,977
You still drinking wine coolers
down random dirt roads

552
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,537
in the middle of the night'?

553
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,073
I haven't done
that in awhile, no.

554
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,347
Look...

555
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,878
I don't want to be coy

556
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,017
and pretend like I don't
remember what happened.

557
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,253
I know that
you and I didn't really

558
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,627
speak much
after that night but...

559
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,292
it was just really tough
for me to come out.

560
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,062
OK.

561
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,033
It was hard for me too so...

562
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,183
This was fun.

563
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,152
Yeah.

564
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,916
If you ever want
to hang out again sometime...

565
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,482
Definitely, I'm just, you know,
with the store and Todd home...

566
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,584
Todd?

567
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,423
Your brother'?

568
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,770
Yeah, there's this
mass pilgrimage

569
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,920
back to the homeland,
apparently.

570
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,398
Why didn't you say anything'?

571
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,027
So, how is he'?

572
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,663
Still Todd.

573
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,970
Now, he's gay too, right'?

574
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,968
Funny.

575
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,107
OK well...

576
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,948
the offer is out there.

577
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,975
You don't have to hang out
with me, you know,

578
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,045
if you don't want to.

579
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,286
- What?
- Nothing.

580
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,261
Just... I don't want you
to feel obligated or whatever.

581
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:33,517
Um, OK.

582
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,523
OK.

If your father were alive
and he knew about this...

588
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,417
I could charge him
for indecent exposure,

589

590
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,520
the sodomy laws
we still have on the books.

591
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,326
Well, technically
he wasn't engaged in...

592
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,026
but I just gave him
a trespassing warning,

594
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,131
John, I appreciate it, really.

He's just been
through a lot recently.

You just never catch
Chet down there, John.

599
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,609
Oh and tell

Whip-its for old times sake,

have anything better to do'?!

603

This is serious, Todd.

They might.

608
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,458
Well, you don't need
their business anyway.

If it were a straight couple,
Officer Fucking John

watched from the woods

- do you want to go or not'?
- No, I'm pumped.

I just don't know
why you won't call him.

624
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,835
Maybe he'd wanna go.

625
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,905
No, this is about
you and I getting away.

626
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,514
OK.

627
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,843
So, do you not think he's gay'?

628
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,481
I don't think everyone
is gay like you do, no.

- Does he know that you're gay'?
- I don't know.

We didn't talk about it
at the market.

Grow a pair
and ask the fucker out.

or just stick with
the rod and reels'?

00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,234
You were always like this.

- Like this.

893

- Any clue'?
- No, I wasn't here.

894
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,142
- What was I supposed to...
- I fed him. I bathed him.

895
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,153
I sat up there
and I watched him die.

896
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,548
And you didn't even
come to the funeral.

897

I do everything, everything,

another mess.

Oh fuck!

I don't know what he told you
but he came onto me-

00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,293
It doesn't matter, OK.
This is what happens.

I don't know what
I expected but...

like you're into me, OK...

910

I'm not pretending-

911
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,275
- I'm not my brother.
- I don't want your brother.

scared little person

914
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,270
and never gone anywhere

915
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,146
so I'm not gonna be able
to compete with that.

Chet, I don't care, OK.

917

I'm not looking for that.

I thought we were
having a good time.

Well, I don't think there's
anything here for you.

I don't... I can't be...

Chet, I don't need
you to be anything.

They took
the fucking 4-wheeler.

Who did?
What happened to your face'?

Apparently some guys were
calling him names at the bar.

Linda said he was egging
them on, being vulgar.

939
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,214

OK but, he said
they took our 4 wheeler.

I don't know what
happened to the 4 wheeler.

That's what he said

but clearly he was
on several substances.

946

he's pretty beat up, John.

- Yeah. Exactly.

things go around here.

Now I'm sorry
if I've offended you or him,

like a piece of shit

that's how people
are gonna treat him.
