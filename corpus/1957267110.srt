00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,958
I'm, that's what I'm saying.

185
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,833
Yes.

186
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,500
I'll get back with you.

187
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,498
They're trying to
fuck us on the price

188
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,792
- at the last meet...
- It's on us, CJ.

189
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,081
Yeah, their attorneys dug up
another owner of the land.

190
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,456
What the hell are
you talking about, who?

191
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,040
[phone ringing]

192
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,498
Yeah?

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,375
Fine.

194
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,040
She's some young, dumb kid.

195
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:14,792
How'd you let
that get past you?

196
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,665
If was earning
corporate attorney money,

197
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,581
I'd do better research.

198
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,123
You'll be making more
than them soon enough.

199
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,042
But in the meantime,
do your job.

200
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:34,040
I contacted her, fed
her enough to get her

201
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,040
to come down here.

202
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,040
She's on her way.

203
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,498
It's all taken care of.

204
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,040
Taken care of?

205
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,873
She's cutting out
a big ass chunk

206
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,875
of my goddamn pie.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,875
Yeah, get in here.

209
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,665
About time.

210
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,790
George had said it be
here and by nine am.

211
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:53,915
It's 10.

212
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:54,748
I'm sorry, Judge Ramage,

213
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,665
we had another delivery.

214
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,083
One more important than mine?

215
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,625
Shut up and hang it over there.

216
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,123
Who is she?

217
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,790
She's a descendant
of Anna Davis.

If you damage it, I will
put a boot up your ass.

221
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,417
Do you see that?

222
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,081
I'm sorry, Judge
Ramage, I got distracted...

223
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,500
Don't interrupt me, boy.

224
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,623
Just leave it and
get the hell out.

225
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,000
Call George and have both
your black asses fired.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,875
Now!

227
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,125
Where's a nice sturdy
oak when you need one?

228
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,958
She didn't have a clue as
to what I was talking about.

229
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,958
Anna Davis, huh?

230
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,875
And John Lewis?

231
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,000
Looks like it.

232
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,792
Is she white?

233
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,167
Mhm.

234
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,623
You tell anybody else?

235
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,125
No, I wanted to
tell you first.

236
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:15,165
Are you sure there's no
way we can cut her out?

237
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,665
No, nothing.

238
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,665
Anna's on that deed
going back to 1913.

239
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,081
This girl is blood.

240
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,873
Her only one left.

241
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,958
Legally that land is hers, too.

242
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,623
Savemart won't buy, unless
it's straight by the book.

243
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,750
Either she gets
on board and signs

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,875
or it's nothing.

245
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,831
Then I guess she's
just gonna have to sign.

246
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,875
And if she doesn't?

247
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,831
She will.

248
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,875

Well, you see.

It's been forever

in here most nights.

Are you sure it's
been that long?

00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,917
Well, I suppose I
could be a bit off.

Don't get any
stupid ideas, Billy.

of Anna Davis,

property 100 years ago,

along with two other buyers.

Yup.

Southern hospitality.

will stay in this room.

anything goes south.

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,456
It's just weird.

367
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,706
One minute I'm getting fired,
thinking I can't make rent,

368
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,748
the next, some
random I've never met

369
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,248
is telling me I have a
ton of money coming to me

370
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,290
from some relative
I've never heard of.

371
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,998
That doesn't
mean it's not true.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,165
Davis, that's not
even my last name.

373
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,290
So?

374
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,415
People get married,
names change.

375
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,040
And it's not like it's
some mom and pop shop.

376
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,623
Savemart is a huge company.

377
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,956
They're not gonna get involved

378
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,165
in some illegitimate
business deal.

379
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,331
That's not it.

380
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,540
[Sarah] What's your
hesitation, then?

381
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,665
It's just happening so fast.

382
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,208
That wouldn't make
you a little nervous?

383
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:56,998
A little.

384
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,206
Not enough to say no.

385
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,123
Did I say I was
going to say no?

386
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,165
You haven't said yes.

387
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,040
[eerie tense music]

388
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,208
Are you a relation
of Anna Davis, dear?

389
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,706
I guess so.

390
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,623
Oh.

391
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,415
You're lighter than I'd expect.

392
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:12,958
Must be from John Lewis

393
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,458
and good breeding down the line.

394
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,331
Who?

395
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,583
What brings you to town?

396
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,623
Just some land I inherited.

397
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,331
Who's John Lewis?

398
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,540
Was that the old Griffin Farm?

399
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,456
Have they finally decided
what they're gonna do with it?

400
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,081
The Griffin Farm?

401
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,581
I don't know.

402
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,290
Well, good for you.

403
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,623
I'm sure you deserve it.

404
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,456
Just like Anna
deserved ever acre

405
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,498
of land she received
for her part.

406
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,498
Her part in what?

407
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,248
You mean you don't
know about Anna Davis?

408
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,665
They haven't told you
about her and John?

409
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,665
Well, they're your blood, honey.

410
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,498
A person should
know their roots.

411
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,123
John had been a proud
confederate soldier

412
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,081
who fought with
Hatch's coast rangers.

413
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,623
After he came home from the war,

414
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,790
he and Anna were
having a love affair.

415
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,665
One night, the Griffin brothers
broke into John's house

416
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,248
Anna was there.

417
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,540
Well, John tried to defend
himself and save Anna

418
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:13,498
but they were too big,
too young, too strong.

419
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,750
Shot the brave old
man with his own gun.

420
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,498
What about Anna?

421
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,706
Well, those two murderers
beat Anna and left her to die.

422
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,290
But she didn't.

423
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,415
Without any hard
evidence, everyone knew

424
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,873
they were gonna go free.

425
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,498
So Anna had to testify.

426
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,123
Well, she got up there
and told her story

427
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,540
and got those two murderers
sent to the electric chair.

428
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,581
That's why she got
that piece of land.

429
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,792
Biggest trial and victory
Blackstock's ever seen.

430
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,206
Everyone here knows the story.

431
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,292
So, she got a piece of the
Griffin Farm for testifying?

432
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,331
[eerie tense music]

433
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,456
138 acres divided
equally between Anna,

434
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,915
the Judge, and the
District Attorney.

435
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,748
Been in their families
for generations.

436
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,292
Oh and those men, they
died because of her?

437
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,415
Oh don't worry about
that dear, not one bit.

438
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,250
Them two niggers deserved a
fright for what they done.

439
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,456
[eerie tense music]

440
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,331
[Woman] Did you
just hear that?

441
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,165
[Woman] Oh my Gosh.

442
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,331
[shushing]

443
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,498
They already don't
like outsiders.

444
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,665
Last thing we need
is for them to know

445
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,540
we voted against segregation.

446
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,373
Then they'll really
want to kill us.

447
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,248
Yeah.

448
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,415
You vote?

449
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,373
It's like blood money, now.

450
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,873
Wait, what?

451
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,873
Well you heard
everything she said.

452
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,915
Plus Anna got the land for
putting those guys in the chair.

453
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,581
Forget for a second
that crazy old coot

454
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,415
and what those guys, did.

455
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:44,498
Don't look at this like
you're inheriting guilt.

456
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,206
You have nothing to atone for.

457
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,292
Take this for what
it is, a blessing.

458
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,915
Guys, can we just
get out of here.

459
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,250
I think I heard I
just heard a banjo.

460
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,790
You should listen
to your friend.

461
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,915
I'm sorry, who are you?

462
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,373
Judge sent us.

463
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,708
We're here to make sure
you get to him tonight.

464
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,500
I think we could find it.

465
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,167
Judge wants to make sure.

466
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:12,500
Let's go.

467
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,875
[eerie tense music]

468
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,665
There you go.

469
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:36,625
They don't want us.

470
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,583

471
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,333
Lyndsy.

472
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,875
Thanks for coming so late.

473
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,208
You remember Roger.

474
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,250
Hi.

475
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,792
Oh, none for me, thank you.

476
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,333
[eerie tense music]

477
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,540
Man, this is some
fucking bullshit.

478
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,750
We didn't even do nothing.

479
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,915
And George.

480
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:28,873
His bitch ass didn't stand
up for us for a second, bruh.

481
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,456
Are you surprised?

482
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,331
Like he's always trying
to screw somebody

483
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,750
out of their hard earned money.

484
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,331
Yes, I'm surprised.

485
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,581
Second of all, like
I'm telling you.

486
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,748
We need to call somebody

487
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,873
and we need to do something.

488
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,540
What are we gonna do, Bennie?

489
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,625
Sue the town judge?

490
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,250
This motherfucking
town is cursed.

491
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,915
Fuck.

492
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,498
Look, we'll find
new jobs tomorrow.

493
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,040
Look, there's a few
stores looking for people.

494
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,500
Seriously, we'll be cool.

495
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,750
You got a couple
dollars saved up, man?

496
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,748
I'm okay for a few weeks.

497
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,040
What about you?

498
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:06,917
Yeah, I'm good.

499
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,500
See you tomorrow, man.

500
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,415
Hey, keep your chin up.

501
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:19,623
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

502
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,790
And that was it.

503
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,831
Son of a bitch got up
and took off running

504
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:26,833
with an arrow in him and
three 30 calibers in his ass.

505
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,540
Poof, gone, without a trace.

506
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:35,498
We go out there,
what a week later,

507
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,456
and there we was.

508
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,292
Laid up dead by the fear.

509
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,625
Now he's mounted on my wall.

510
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,456
Sure is getting awfully late.

511
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,456
Another round.

512
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,665
Oh none for me, no thanks.

513
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,373
Oh come on now.

514
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,375
[eerie tense music]

515
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,458
So, tell me, Lyndsy.

516
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,542
Have you made up your
mind on the land?

517
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,833
Will you join us?

518
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,540
I'm gonna be straight
with you, sweetheart.

519
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,456
Opportunities of a
lifetime like this

520
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,667
don't come along very often.

521
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,040
You were lucky enough
to have an ancestor

522
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,998
who had the good conscious
to do the right thing.

523
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,583
And was rewarded for it.

524
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,706
Now, 100 years later,

525
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,500
you have a similar choice.

526
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,000
You have your whole
life ahead of you.

527
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,375
Think of what you can
do with all that money.

528
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,500
Think of our town.

529
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,623
Like this here, is
a win win situation

530
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,708
for all of us.

531
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,542
But I just met you.

532
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,998
You're doing business now

533
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,915
with the third generation judge

534
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,042
and an attorney.

535
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,500
What can possibly go wrong.

00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:26,873

What, what?

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,081
Where you headed?

543
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,748
White mans asking
you a question, boy.

544
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,915
You better answer him.

545
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:54,998

551
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,831
What you up to, boys?

552
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,790
Oh nothing much,
Sheriff Brice.

553
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,000
You sure about that now?

554
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:24,081
There aint gonna be any problems
in town tonight, are there?

555
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,458
Nothing much.

556
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,708
No, sir.

557
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,667
You boys have a nice night.

558
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,790

Now come on.

567
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,500
Get him back there.

568
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,831

[man coughing]

570
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,748
Blackstock folk used
to use this beauty

571
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,708
to string you boys
up all the time.

572
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,165
Good folk.

573
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,167
Good Klan folk.

574
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,748

Pull 'em up, Bear.

581
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,331
No.

582
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,665
Get 'em up.

583
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,331
Pull 'em up.

584
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,206
Yeah, pull 'em up.

585
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,790
There you go, Bear.

586
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,292
Keep him up there,
let him swing.

587
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,042
Up again.

588
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,123
Leave him up there this time.

589
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,623
Tie it up.

[man screaming]

599
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,748
Don't worry about it.

[group laughing]

601
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,748
That was so good.

602
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,623
Yeah, amazing.

603
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,248
Okay, but I cannot believe
that you two ate that.

604
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,290
Everything was deep friend.

605
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,790
And slathered in butter.

606
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,956
I need that sunscreen.

607
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,792
You're actually
gonna go back in there?

608
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,167
Speak of the devil.

609
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,000
Do you see another option?

Hey, excuse me,
do you work here?

613
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,331
Uh, no.

614
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,040
I wish I did, though.

615
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:39,748
Hopefully.

616
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,831
I had a job until yesterday.

617
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,790
Oh no.

618
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,792
I know how you feel though.

619
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:47,248
I'm Jesse.

620
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,125
Lyndsy.

621
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,167
Lyndsy, I found it.

622
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:55,917
Huh?

623
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,667
Yeah, what SPF are you?

624
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,667
Just one second.

625
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,873
Okay, he is so cute.

626
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,040
Yeah, he is.

627
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,248
I thought you said
you found the sunscreen.

628
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,915
Yeah no, what
made you think that?

629
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:17,165
Can you please find
me the sunscreen?

630
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,040
SPF 30, dry touch sunblock.

631
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:19,915
Wait, wait, wait.

632
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:20,915
What do you think?

633
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:21,833
Is he cute?

634
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:23,792
Yes.

635
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,958
[eerie tense music]

636
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,083
Fuck it.

637
00:32:58,542 --> 00:32:59,873
[laughing]

638
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,833
You go on and try it.

639
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,956
Oh my God, what is this?

640
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,875
You've never had a
chocolate ball before?

641
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,248
Chocolate turtle with
pecans, caramel, chocolate.

642
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,750
Look, it's made right here.

643
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,373
I'm not interrupting, am I?

644
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,248
Uh uh.

645
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,333
Here's your sunscreen.

646
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,540
You want the one
with the coco butters.

647
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,417
Better for the
skin, moisturizes.

648
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:30,417
So I'm told.

00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:45,833

[eerie tense music]

653
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,123
If you've come to tell
us them boys did some harm,

654
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,081
all I can say is we
didn't see nothing.

655
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,042
Y'all looked happy as a couple
of pigs in the slop to us.

656
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,792
Look, I'm just here to
tell you they're dead.

657
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,290
What are you
talking about, boy?

658
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:20,540
Did you kill 'em?

659
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,998
No, no someone,
something did it.

660
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,373
I don't know what it was.

661
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,165
You better get yourself
and your story straight,

662
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,373
right quick.

663
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,206
It was like the devil.

664
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,373
Say again?
[Deputy laughing]

665
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,290
It was huge and
it had a pitchfork.

666
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:33,498
Was it red?

667
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,873
What about a tail?

668
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,123
No, no, no.

669
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,998
It was a man but in all black.

670
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,375
[Both] Kinda like you then.

671
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,540
Look, it just threw
'em like paper dolls.

672
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,581
It tore 'em to pieces

673
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,165
and after it tore 'em to pieces,

674
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,458
their asses were gone.

675
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,165
[laughing]

676
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,000
Look, screw you.

677
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,415
Screw you.

678
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:00,331
I'm out.

679
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,040
And I'm telling everybody.

680
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,665
Where do you, where do
you think you're going?

681
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,540
We can't have you running
around town causing trouble.

682
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,540
Especially if you're
our prime suspect

683
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:10,206
if those boys are hurt.

684
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,917
You aint going nowhere, boy.

685
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:14,208
Fuck.

686
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,125
Are you sure
they're gonna be fine?

687
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,165
What your friends?

688
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,665
They'll be fine.

689
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,250
What's gonna happen to them?

690
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,206
So, why'd you say
you know how I feel?

691
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,373
What?

692
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,623
Earlier when I
said I'd been fired

693
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,123
you said you knew how I felt.

694
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,373
Oh, I was, too.

695
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,373
Just before coming here.

696
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,250
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,165
What happened?

698
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,290
My manager was a jerk.

699
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,081
He was always coming on to me.

700
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,540
He would say all
kinds of things to me.

701
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:02,625
I just ignored him
but he wouldn't stop.

702
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,498
Finally, when I told
him I wasn't interested,

703
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,331
he was really mean to me.

704
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,956
Then one morning I walk in
and there he is waiting for me

705
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,706
and says you no longer work here

706
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,665
and he hands me a box
with all my stuff in it.

707
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,165
That's messed up.

708
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,415
Yeah, so.

709
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,581
It's for the best.

710
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,333
I wasn't appreciated, anyways.

711
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,958
What about you then?

712
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,540
I dropped a stuffed animal.

713
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:30,581
[laughing]

714
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:31,456
No, seriously.

715
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,415
My friend, Bennie, and I

716
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:33,498
we've known each other
since we were born.

717
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,083
We were like brothers.

718
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,540
We're all the others got.

719
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,623
My families been in Blackstock

720
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,458
since Andrew Jackson
was president.

721
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,081
And we worked for
a delivery company

722
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,748
and we were on a
run to a guys office

723
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,206
and I guess he got some bad news

724
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,500
because he tore into us.

725
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:57,167
He's a powerful
guy in Blackstock.

726
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,998
Like real powerful.

727
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,665
He had us fired before
our next delivery.

728
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,625
That's terrible.

729
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,167
It's for the best.

730
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,458
I wasn't appreciated there.

731
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,206
[laughing]

732
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,250
[soft country music]

733
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,667
Come on, I wanna
show you something.

734
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,625
Cool?

735
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,375
All right.

736
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,333
Ah, it's so beautiful here.

737
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,790
So peaceful.

738
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,125
So different then
from where I'm from.

739
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:49,415
What brings you to
these parts, anyway?

740
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,081
A relative passed.

741
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,625
I had to come down here and
take care of some legal stuff.

742
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,623
I'm sorry.

743
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,873
Were you close?

744
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,125
No, we never met.

745
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,373
Well you know, there's
a cemetery near here.

746
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,373
Some of my family
is buried there

747
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,125
and I go there
sometimes to think,

748
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:12,167
clear my head.

749
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,373
Cemetery?

750
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,250
Yup.

751
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,748
You just gotta stay
away from the boo hags.

752
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,625
The boo whats?

753
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,498
Guess you don't have
those where you're from.

754
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,623
No, what are they?

755
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:29,748
Spirits kinda like vampires.

756
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,458
Except they feed off your
breath, not your blood.

757
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,415
Yeah, they have no
skin so they're all red

758
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,665
but then, they look for people,

759
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,750
wear they skin
and they rock 'em.

760
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,331
They're South Carolina legend.

761
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,208
Gross.

762
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,915
Yeah.

763
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:52,873
They're supposed to hang around
like old slave cemeteries

764
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,083
and displaced burial sites.

765
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,748
You see, much of Blackstock
is built on used land.

766
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,708
Some of which was colonial
era slave cemeteries.

767
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:04,750
Yeah.

768
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,333
I sure could have used a
place to think yesterday.

769
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,208
So have you figured it out?

770
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,167
I think so.

771
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,292
That's good.

772
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,875
[eerie tense music]

773
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,125
Heading out for a smoke.

774
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,290
You know them things
are gonna kill ya.

775
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,167
Later rather than sooner.

776
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,540
So to ease her pain,

777
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:06,873
he keeps putting
a shot of whiskey,

778
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,498
every day a little bit more,

779
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,331
a little bit more into her milk

780
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,998
and on her death
bed, the last day,

781
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,456
she says, Son, whatever you do,

782
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,956
don't sell that cow.

783
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,667
[both laughing]

784
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,956
Get a room, you two.

785
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,665
[both laughing]

786
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:26,542
Samantha.

787
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,625
She's here.

788
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,706
Oh.

789
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:38,456
Remember, business
first, pleasure later.

790
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:42,290
[eerie tense music]

791
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,417
How long till later?

792
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,833
[Newbold] Oh, here she is.

793
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,415
[Lyndsy] Wanna hang
out tomorrow, maybe?

794
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,790
[Jesse] Yeah.

795
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:58,873
Lyndsy, they were
wondering where you were.

796
00:40:58,875 --> 00:40:59,917
They're ready for you.

797
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,373
Excuse us.

798
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,208
Hey, I'll be right
back, you guys.

799
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,208
[Samantha] Corey.

800
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,040
Cheers.

801
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,542
What I tell you?

802
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,583
Alrighty then.

803
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,040
I assume we all
have a clear head

804
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:31,625
and are still on board here.

805
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,331
We agree this is a
very generous offer

806
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:39,373
for that land, isn't that right?

807
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,250
Yes.

808
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,417
Good.

809
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:46,040
Let's get it signed and
head over to the courthouse

810
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:49,081
there's a fax in
the clerk's office.

811
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,748
Why don't we just
scan it and email it?

812
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,708
I want in their
hands, damn it.

813
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:56,667
Let's go.

814
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,625
Everybody head over
to the courthouse.

815
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,833
Samantha.

816
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,873
[eerie heavy breathing]

817
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,123
Yes, daddy?

818
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,750
You make sure she gets there.

819
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:17,790
[Samantha] Where you going?

820
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:19,456
Office.

821
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,792
I need to grab a few things.

822
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,873
Look what I found.

823
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:30,748
You ready?

824
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,790
Yeah.

825
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:32,667
Great.

826
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:42,292
[eerie heavy breathing]

827
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,581
Hey, I just have to
go to the courthouse

828
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,540
and sign something.

829
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,456
And then we can leave?

830
00:42:58,458 --> 00:42:59,706
Yup.

831
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,081
Hey, you wanna walk
us over there, Jesse?

832
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:02,917
Fine.

833
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,831
Uh, Jesse.

834
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,498
Everything okay?

835
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,458
Yup, we're cool.

836
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,083
What's wrong, are you mad?

837
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,000
Hey, will you tell
me what's going on?

838
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,998
Look, what's the name of
your relative that died?

839
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,917
Anna Davis.

840
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,873
So you just left
out a few details

841
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,623
like who you're
related to and the fact

842
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,998
that she died 75 years ago?

843
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,956
Hey, two days ago I didn't
even know she existed.

844
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:28,956
And your inheritance.

845
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,748
He told me not
to say anything.

846
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,000
Who told you not to
say anything, was it CJ?

847
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:36,831
So I'm sure you
heard the whole story

848
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,790
behind the Griffin Farm, right?

849
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:39,998
I heard a few things,

850
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,498
I don't know if it
was the whole story.

851
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,998
Ah, just the
important parts, then?

852
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,748
You actually believe
everything you hear?

853
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,456
I don't know why they
would lie to me about it.

854
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,040
So, you going through with it?

855
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,831
You're actually gonna
go into business with CJ

856
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:54,706
and sell the land?

857
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:55,748
I don't see why not.

858
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,873
Why not?

859
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,540
Because CJ is a liar and a cheat

860
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,831
and over all just a sad
excuse for a human being

861
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,083
and that's just one reason.

862
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,581
Look, I got called
down here out of nowhere

863
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:08,873
and this whole deal was
just thrown in my lap.

864
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,206
I don't know these
people hardly at all.

865
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,081
I don't know who they
are and what they do

866
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,831
and I sure as hell
don't know why

867
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,248
you're acting like
this right now.

868
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,915
Someone basically handed
me a winning lotto ticket

869
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,417
and I'm cashing in.

870
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,665
Just like that?

871
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,000
Just like that.

872
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,040
All right then.

873
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,500
You and your girlfriends
have a safe trip home.

874
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:39,956
I knew we should
have never let you out

875
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,748
of our sight tonight.

876
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,083
What just happened?

877
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,956
He's a Griffin, sweetheart.

878
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:48,165
Somewhere way down
the line his great,

879
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:53,167
whatever, uncles seriously
fucked up your family.

880
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:54,833
Griffin?

881
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:58,790
Two guys a long
time ago killed a man

882
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:00,667
and then raped the
woman he was with.

883
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:02,958
John Lewis.

884
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,040
But what does that
have to do with me

885
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,790
and why would that make him mad?

886
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,123
Wouldn't it be the
other way around?

887
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,790
They've all been
crazy as shit since.

888
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,833
It's all in the blood.

889
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:16,958
Come on, let's go cash in
that winning lotto ticket.

890
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,125
But...

891
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
[eerie tense music]

892
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,708
[eerie heavy breathing]

893
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:16,542
[eerie heavy breathing]

894
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,915
What are we gonna do with
that piece of shit in there?

895
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:26,042
We gonna charge him
or cut him loose?

896
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,667
Something.

897
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,667
You know that boy Jesse's gonna
be coming looking for him.

898
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,748
You know, that was a
great uncle of mine

899
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,748
that pulled the switch
on them two brothers.

900
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,623
Is that right?

901
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:40,790
Yup.

902
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,123
He always said it
took four tries

903
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:43,250
to get one of 'em down.

904
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:49,208
He had to crank that
needle up to 2,500 volts.

905
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,248
Enough to put a horse down.

906
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,331
[both laughing]

907
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,331
Damn, Sheriff.

908
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:58,248
That's something to be
proud of right there.

909
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,915
Did this town a service.

910
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,915
It is indeed.

911
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,623
I oughta have a
bumper sticker made.

912
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,081

How much land did they own?

917
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,706
138 acres and
would you believe

918
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:22,081

two days in court?

937
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,498
Have you told
anyone else about it?

938

[Old Woman] They're
your blood, honey.

1152
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,915
A person should
know their roots.

1153

What the fuck?

1154
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,748
[Old Woman] One night,
the Griffin brothers

1155

broke into John's
house, Anna was there.

1156

Shot the brave old
man with his own gun.

1157
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:21,123
Anna had to testify.

[gunshot]

1159
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,875
That's why she got
that piece of land.

1160
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:30,748
138 acres divided
equally between Anna,

1161

Jesse, you came back for me?

1177
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:17,998
I knew you were in trouble.

1178
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,875
How?

1179
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,125
Those two chasing you,

1180
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,248
their names are Thomas
and Meeks Griffin,

1181
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,125
they're my great uncles.

1182
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:29,208
Wait, there are two of them?

1183
01:06:32,417 --> 01:06:34,292
That means they're
still out there.

1184
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:37,081
Now they're back from
the grave, pissed off,

1185
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,083
and coming after you.

1186
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,917
I guess the boo
hags exist after all.

1187
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,375
But what did I do?

1188
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:49,415
You're the last link
of the conspiracy.

1189
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:50,373
What conspiracy?

1190
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,206
I thought they killed someone.

1191
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,792
They didn't kill John Lewis.

1192
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,915
Look, the murder, the
trial, it was all a set up.

1193
01:06:57,917 --> 01:07:00,040
Anna Davis testimony was a lie.

1194
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:01,831
Her story put them
in an electric chair.

1195
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,456
For some money and a watch?

1196
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,792
No for their land.

1197
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:09,248
Look, my uncles were
prominent and wealthy farmers.

1198
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,290
They had 138 acres.

1199
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,540
That's more property and money

1200
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,333
than anyone in
Blackstock back then.

1201
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:19,040
Dangerous territory if
you were black in 1913.

1202
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:21,415
But what about the trial?

1203
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:23,623
That was all bullshit.

1204
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,248
Look, they were framed
and wrongfully executed

1205
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,417
so the people involved
could get their land.

1206
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:31,292
Thomas and Meeks sold all of
it to pay for their defense.

1207
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,915
Look, all of you
owners have direct ties

1208
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,373
with the conspiracy.

1209
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,290
CJ's great grandfather
was the judge

1210
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,542
who plotted the whole thing

1211
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,498
and Roger's related
to the prosecutor

1212
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,167
who sent them to the chair.

1213
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,083
And me?

1214
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,500

1215
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,375
[gunshot]

1216
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:30,292
You're the one with
the blood all on you.

1217
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,373
This is his gun.

1218
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,540
She shot him with this gun.

1219
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:39,208
- It's been in...
- CJ's office.

1220
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,208
I never realized it.

1221
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:47,665
Look, we need to
get out of here.

1222
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:49,542
They're coming after everybody
that was involved in any way.

1223
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:53,540
This is all happening
because of my family,

1224
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:54,375
because of me.

1225
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,248
I signed that contract.

1226
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,623
Look, CJ would of
found some other way

1227
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:01,917
to profit off the land.

1228
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,917
Without me, all these
people might still be alive.

1229
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:19,415
You can't think
about that right now.

1230
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:22,415
'Cause there's nothing you
can do to take it back.

1231
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:24,583
Right now, we need
to get out of here.

1232
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,581
You're wrong.

1233
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,706
There is something I can do.

1234
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,415
I can make it right.

1235
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,956
I can take my name
off that contract.

1236
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,498
Where is it?

1237
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,581
Roger went to fax it.

1238
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:37,706
Where?

1239
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:38,581
The clerk's office.

01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:42,165
Yes.

1242
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:43,042

You reap what you sow.

1247
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,333
Now come on, let's
find the contract.

1249
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,748
