00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,690
These, um...

531
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:20,857
These records that you asked
me to order for the jukebox?

532
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:25,983
Some Enchanted Evening?
Light My Fire? You Send Me?

533
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,400
What about
them?

534
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:31,649
These were Patrick’s
favorites, weren’t they?

535
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,649
Well, why tear
yourself up?

536
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,941
Going back to Patrick
and the past...

537
00:32:35,942 --> 00:32:37,816
Well...

538
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:40,191
Look at that list.
There’s current ones.

539
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,440
Maggie, come on.

540
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:45,733
Well, part of the reason
for me coming up here,

541
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:49,898
this whole journey was just
to reconnect with a happy time.

542
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:53,981
Come out refreshed
and with my head together.

543
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:56,898
Hey, good. I just
hope that all this work

544
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:58,898
is building something
for your future,

545
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,065
not getting you stuck
in the past.

546
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:04,649
Ladies, I found a great buy on
lilies for the front entrance.

547
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,856
My dad had this picture
of the place years ago

548
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:09,398
with all these lilies out
in front and it was great.

549
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:11,689
I almost forgot.
You have to decide

550
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,731
whether you want to
paint the dance floor

551
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:16,149
or if you want stain
and seal coats.

552
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:20,940
Oh, well, just check it
with Claire.

553
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:29,480
Eighty dollars for this ad.
It’s ridiculous.

554
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:31,063
Let me see.

555
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:33,896
We should be putting posters up
on telephone poles.

556
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:36,189
Well, people don’t read
telephone poles.

557
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,855
Maybe John can
get it cheaper.

558
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:40,939
Well, you
ask him then.

559
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,648
Speaking of
your foreman,

560
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,647
Maggie, he thinks
you’re avoiding him.

561
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,189
And he keeps
asking me why.

562
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,106
He’s uncomfortable.

563
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:52,438
Well, I don’t know
what to do. I...

564
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,064
I see him and
I think of Patrick,

565
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,355
whom I loved
so much.

566
00:33:57,356 --> 00:33:59,354
My first romance.

567
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:00,937
There John
is smiling at me,

568
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,104
telling me a section of the roof
has got dry rot and I...

569
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:05,897
I’m just
shivering inside.

570
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:07,854
It shakes me up.

571
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:09,937
Even his hands
are like Patrick’s.

572
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:13,646
Same broad palms
and long fingers.

573
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,270
You could
get lost in them.

574
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:16,646
Am I supposed
to tell him that?

575
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:19,062
Sounds positively
pornographic.

576
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:20,978
Tell me.

577
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:24,103
Oh, Maggie,
he is not Patrick.

578
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,646
He’s nothing
like him.

579
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,146
And it’s not nice,
the way you’re treating him.

580
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,188
JOHN:
Maggie?

581
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:32,144
I’d like to
show you something.

582
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:35,062
Would you mind coming with me,
please?

583
00:34:35,063 --> 00:34:36,604
Yep.

584
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:43,687
You’ve got people all excited
about the opening of The Moon.

585
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:47,102
I want it to be the
biggest event of the year.

586
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:50,604
I think this town needs
the Harvest Moon.

587
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,352
My dad used to
always go on

588
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:55,644
about how you could go down
there any night of the week

589
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:57,644
and you’d always run
into your friends.

590
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:00,477
And in those days
everyone danced

591
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,937
and nobody cared whether they
looked cool or not.

592
00:35:02,938 --> 00:35:06,437
They just let
themselves go. You know?

593
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,145
I think you’re bringing
that back here.

594
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:12,311
You think people today
want the same things?

595
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,810
Yeah.

596
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,353
I do.

597
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,103
What do you think?
Oh, you fixed the sign.

598
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:33,101
That’s the way it looked
in my dad’s photo.

599
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:34,935
I remember.
It’s just the way it was

600
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:37,643
when I drove up in
my pale blue Plymouth.

601
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,853
Years ago,
for the first time.

602
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:42,977
I was so nervous.

603
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:46,185
I wanted to become part
of the whole thing here.

604
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,642
Well, well, I did.

605
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:52,892
After breaking 30 beer bottles,
I wasn’t much of a waitress.

606
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:55,518
I’m amazed Harriet
didn’t fire me.

607
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:09,727
Look, look.
There’s a monarch.

608
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:14,726
He’ll probably
hibernate soon.

609
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,601
No, actually,

610
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:19,101
I think monarchs
are the only butterfly

611
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:23,517
that migrates thousands
of miles south in the winter.

612
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:25,935
All with these
delicate wings.

613
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,933
Ah.

614
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:41,183
Oh, thousands of miles.

615
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:45,432
God, how could anything
be so determined

616
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,600
and so fragile?

617
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,642
It’s like you.

618
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,266
Doing all of this.

619
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:09,431
Maggie, there’s been
an accident!

620
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:10,682
Oh my God!
What happened?

621
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:12,432
He fell off the roof.
Bring him in.

622
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:15,348
I’ll call the doctor.
We were putting the tarp up.

623
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,139
The doctor wants you observed
for at least three hours.

624
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,141
So you don’t fall asleep
or lose consciousness.

625
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:24,474
I should go
home now.

626
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,223
No, you should be lying quietly.
I feel fine.

627
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:29,558
You should stay at least
one more hour, John.

628
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:36,681
JOHN:
Claire tells me
you’re a teacher.

629
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:38,557
What do you teach?

630
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,765
English literature.

631
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:44,390
JOHN:
Literature. I like that word.

632
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:47,515
You know, it’s just got
to be good for you.

633
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,598
I wasn’t very
good in school.

634
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,264
Guess, I was more interested
in working with my hands.

635
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:58,889
Always liked books, though.
It was school that put me off.

636
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,848
Didn’t your father
encourage you to read?

637
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,513
A Keats fan?
Oh, yeah.

638
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:11,137
He said that I would come to
it eventually, in my own time.

639
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:12,846
In my own way.

640
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:15,389
He was right,
of course.

641
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,263
I find myself reading
more and more.

642
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:20,138
What are some
of your favorite books?

643
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,596
Maybe  Crime and Punishment.

644
00:38:22,597 --> 00:38:24,054
Or  Steppenwolf.

645
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,304
That’s funny.
So many guys love that book.

646
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,679
Is that sarcasm?
No.

647
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,637
No, they’re both fine books,
really.

648
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:35,554
Recently I read
Wuthering Heights.

649
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:37,471
Unbelievably romantic.

650
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:42,179
The characters long
to be together for years.

651
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,221
But when she finally gets
her man, she dies.

652
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:48,221
In a sense,
she loves the wrong man.

653
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:50,886
How can you love
the wrong man?

654
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:52,678
I mean,
love is such a gift.

655
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,387
I think it’s enough
just to love.

656
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:58,386
Don’t you?
Oh.

657
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:01,095
I don’t really have
a philosophy.

658
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:03,095
Not about love,
anyway.

659
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:07,262
I have sort of been
having a fantasy.

660
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,304
Sort of an exercise to get me
through a difficult phase.

661
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:13,303
I call it the
Cult of Aphrodite.

662
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:15,845
All the women
can have five lovers.

663
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:18,385
And all the men
must be monogamous.

664
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:19,845
Or they turn
into eunuchs.

665
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,553
Wow.

666
00:39:21,554 --> 00:39:24,052
That must
be some phase.

667
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:26,595
Yeah.
It is some phase.

668
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:29,718
Facing that you’re
a supporting player

669
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:33,888
in other people’s lives
and not truly important.

670
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:39,468
I didn’t...

671
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:41,593
I didn’t thank you
for drying my boots off.

672
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:43,427
I’m gonna have to go
get them wet now.

673
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:46,593
Oh, there you are.
Oh, sweetie.

674
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:48,469
Thanks so much for
taking care of him.

675
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,676
JOHN:
Amy, I told you I was okay.

676
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:52,428
I could have
driven myself.

677
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:55,136
Honey, you
fell off a roof.

678
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:58,179
Come on, let’s go.
Come on.

679
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,594
Thanks for
the first aid.

680
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:03,801
And don’t worry,
we’ll open The Moon on time.

681
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:06,678
Promise.
Goodnight.

682
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,384
Okay, thanks.
All right.

683
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:02,425
Uh, they say the Moon’s
foundation is slipping.

684
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,801
We’re gonna have to reinforce it
with concrete and steel.

685
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,923
Well, then we’ll do it.
We have three weeks.

686
00:41:10,924 --> 00:41:14,091
Um, it’s gonna
cost a lot.

687
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:29,132
That building has been
standing a hundred years.

688
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:32,590
We can refinance our place,
can’t we, Gil?

689
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,216
Get some money
for this.

690
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:36,881
Mom, the little equity
you have in your house,

691
00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:38,673
it’s everything
you’ve got.

692
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:41,422
Now I have some money coming
from my latest divorce.

693
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:43,590
Uh, but not for
a couple of months.

694
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:45,424
I could sell my house
back home, but...

695
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:47,089
it’s not gonna
help us now.

696
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,381
You could
open later.

697
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:54,173
I was hoping I was gonna be
able to raise part of the money

698
00:41:54,174 --> 00:41:56,006
and you’d give me
a loan for the rest.

699
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:58,090
I’ve reached the bottom
of my piggy bank.

700
00:41:58,091 --> 00:42:01,339
When you reach the bottom,
you wonder what’s gonna happen.

701
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,300
You wonder
