1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,140
- So I had this ten-year plan
for myself,

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,309
and my life
was right on schedule.

3
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,677
I was up
for senior v.P. Today,

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,046
and I had a pretty good feeling
about it.

5
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:14,914
- We have to let her go.

6
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,682
Half of her clients
won't work with her.

7
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:17,583
- She's going to yell.

8
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:21,120
I hate it when she yells.
Makes me look weak.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,325
- You wanted to see me, don?
- Hey, there she is.

10
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,793
You look fantastic.

11
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,762
- Thanks.
Having a great day.

12
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,330
- Well, it's early.
- What?

13
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:34,800
- Jennifer, I respect you
too much to pussyfoot around.

14
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,636
I'm just going to say it
straight out. Clay?

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,838
- We're letting you go.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,874
- But...Senior v.P.

17
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:42,575
- You have anger issues.

18
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:44,977
Frankly, it's something that's
followed you your whole career.

19
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,781
- I don't have anger issues!
Who says I have anger issues?

20
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,382
- She's yelling.

21
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:53,419
Jennifer, you are very good
at your job, but...

22
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,521
You have a personality problem.

23
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:59,525
You're aggressive, you're cocky,
you take no prisoners.

24
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,560
- Qualities that get men
promotions.

25
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,829
- And then you say
hurtful things like that.

26
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:04,363
- Unbelievable.

27
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,333
- Hey, you know,
take the rest of the day off.

28
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,601
Go to the zoo.

29
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:10,703
They have these baby pandas.

30
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:12,405
They'll just melt your heart.

31
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:16,609
- Um, the mother ate
her babies.

32
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,844
- What? When?

33
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,814
Oh, come on in.

34
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,483
Jennifer, you know Connie
from h.R.

35
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,285
And Larry from security.

36
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,255
They're here to make sure
you don't shoot the place up.

37
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,990
Right, guys?

38
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,292
But seriously,
you should go now.

39
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,161
- Yeah.

40
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,029
- Don, you handled that
beautifully.

41
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,131
- I felt good.
I felt strong.

42
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:43,402
- You know what, if you're gonna
fire me for my anger issues,

43
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,104
I might as well get
my money's worth, don.

44
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,541
Nobody gives a rat's ass
what you shot at pebble beach.

45
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,609
All the assistants
are creeped out

46
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,544
by your rapey backrubs.

47
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,613
You are weak, lazy,
hog all the credit,

48
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:59,285
take none of the blame,
and your breath smells like ass.

49
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,362
We carpooled.

50
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,765
- Oh, that's right.
It's Tuesday.

51
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:13,432
- I can take a cab.

52
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,836
- No, no, no.
I mean, you're on the way.

53
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:20,306
- Great.

54
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:26,178
- So it's been six months,
and I've gotten really close

55
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,047
on a lot of jobs,
but apparently,

56
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,515
blackballing is a real thing.

57
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:33,018
The good news is, I'm getting
a lot of helpful feedback.

58
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,988
Evidently, the men in
the industry find me terrifying,

59
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,024
but all the women
find me inspiring

60
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,893
and also terrifying.

61
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,394
But hey,
I'm going to be fine.

62
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:47,066
I mean, I'm still confident,
still strong, still--

63
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:50,469
excuse me.

64
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,338
Unbeatable.

65
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,643
- Mom, you're not listening.

66
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,146
I don't want to live
at grandma's.

67
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,314
How are we broke?
You made so much money.

68
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,550
- Yeah, but we spent
so much more.

69
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,386
Mom, please don't make a fuss.

70
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,487
- So we have nothing?

71
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,623
- Oh, no, we still have
mountains of debt.

72
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,924
Mom, you're not listening!

73
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,760
- Are you going to be drunk
the whole time we're there?

74
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,529
- It's looking that way,
sweetie.

75
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,899
Mom, please promise me you're
not going to throw a party.

76
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,534
- She's back!

77
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,635
- Hey.
- Hi!

78
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:26,539
It's a party.

79
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,973
What are you doing?

80
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,208
- Well, I know you said
no party,

81
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,345
but it's just family
and friends, very low-key.

82
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,548
- A mariachi band?

83
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,218
- This close to cinco de Mayo,
it was such a coup to get them.

84
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,987
- Look, mom, I really appreciate
you taking us in, I do,

85
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,357
but this isn't really
a party day for me.

86
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,295
I mean, I can't get a job,
I am upside down in my house,

87
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,262
I burned
through all my savings,

88
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,198
and now I've got<i> LA cucaracha</i>
in my head!

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,867
- Sounds like somebody needs
a Margarita.

90
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,002
- No, mom, that is
so not what I'm saying.

91
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:02,741
I j--no salt!
Please.

92
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,109
Salt.

93
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,479
Hey, Wayne.
- Hey, sis.

94
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,782
Quit screwing around, dude.

95
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:10,616
- Jennifer!

96
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,384
How's your anger?

97
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,454
- Great, Steph.
How's your passive aggression?

98
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,756
You're so funny.

99
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:22,061
Wayne and I were both so sick
about what happened to you.

100
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:24,163
You lost everything?
- I did.

101
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,764
- Ugh, that beautiful house

102
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,133
in Santa Monica
that blocked everybody's view.

103
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:28,734
- Lost the house.

104
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,737
- Gorgeous condo in Maui
that we only saw in pictures.

105
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,606
- Mm, condo's gone.

106
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,607
- Oh, and that hockney print

107
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,642
that you didn't even
light properly.

108
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,777
That's three, Wayne.

109
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,780
- What, but I didn't even--
- next!

110
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,983
- This isn't over, Conner.

111
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:47,019
Babe, will you please
get me a drink?

112
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,686
- Okay.

113
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,789
Just don't talk about
the eviction till I get back.

114
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,159
- Give me that.

115
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,063
Cannot believe I'm back home
living with mom.

116
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,767
Soon as I make some money,
I'm out of here.

117
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,270
- You can always come to work
for me at the bar.

118
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,639
You make your own hours.
We have health care.

119
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,573
- Wait,
you have health care?

120
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:11,010
- No, come on, we don't
even have a first aid kit.

121
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:15,080
- Okay, why the hell not?
Thanks, bro.

122
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,417
- Wow, I'm gonna be
your boss.

123
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,086
- Oh, my God,
I feel like such a loser.

124
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,755
- Oh, come on,
you're not a loser.

125
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,824
Just 'cause you're back living
with mom and you got fired

126
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,794
and you're blackballed
and humiliated,

127
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,462
you have no money.

128
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,230
You used to be rich.

129
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,999
There are plenty of people
out there who will never make

130
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,100
what you lost.

131
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,283
Hey, kids.

132
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:55,254
Want, um--
you want some candy?

133
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,823
There's a lot of candy here.

134
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,887
- Morning, mom.
- Good morning.

135
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,122
It's so good
to have you back, honey.

136
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:10,727
- Thanks, but you know
I'm not<i> back</i> back.

137
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:11,628
It's just for a few weeks.

138
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,497
- A few weeks, forever.
We don't have to define it.

139
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,468
- Mmm.
Bacon waffles?

140
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,170
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,606
- Okay, forever.

142
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:24,107
Is there anybody
in the neighborhood

143
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,508
left from the old days?

144
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,543
- Let's see.

145
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:29,512
Mike Dorfman is living
in his mom's garage,

146
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,647
has it fixed up real cute.

147
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,383
He runs his own
computer repair business,

148
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,551
and he's still single.

149
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,620
- It's like a fairy tale.

150
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,888
- Oh, and I ran
into your old friend Dina simac

151
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,391
at the grocery store
last week.

152
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:42,058
- Dina?
- Yeah.

153
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,527
I asked her over for dinner.
- Oh, my God!

154
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,630
I have missed her so much.
I love Dina.

155
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:49,366
You know, we haven't seen each
other in a really long time.

156
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,901
She is exactly
what I need right now.

157
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,804
- She doesn't want to see you.

158
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:56,506
- What? Why?

159
00:06:56,508 --> 00:07:01,278
- I didn't ask.
It's not my place.

160
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,878
- Wow.

161
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,881
- Did you eat cheese
last night?

162
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,434
- Okay, put my self-respect
in the locker.

163
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:27,771
Where do I start?

164
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,939
What?

165
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:30,940
- Life is funny.

166
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:34,778
You used to babysit me,
and now I'm your boss.

167
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,179
The paths we take.

168
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:36,980
- Yeah.

169
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,015
- Let me show you
how to pour a draft.

170
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:40,450
Now, the trick is--

171
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:43,253
I was a v.P.
For a fortune 500 company.

172
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:47,023
I can pour a beer.
- Okay.

173
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:57,334
- Okay, here is your glass of...

174
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,735
Foam.

175
00:07:58,737 --> 00:07:59,502
- Wow.

176
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:03,073
- Sorry about that.
That one is on me.

177
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,374
- That's okay.

178
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:07,777
- Okay.

179
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,878
- Hello, girls.

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,148
- Hey! Just because I'm wearing
this little sports-whore outfit

181
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,951
does not mean I'm gonna put up
with crap from jerks like you,

182
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,553
you got it?
- Got it.

183
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:20,557
And these are my girls,
abbie and lily.

184
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,991
It's our weekend together.
We're having dinner.

185
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,227
- Hey, it's so nice--
so nice to meet you.

186
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,165
- I'll be right there, guys.

187
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,969
- I'm sorry.
Your girls are adorable.

188
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:37,807
- Thank you.
So are yours.

189
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,112
- Okay, here's the deal--
think of a sports bar

190
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:44,180
like it was dad's den
when we were kids.

191
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:46,316
Never stand in front of a TV
when a game is on,

192
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,285
and never tell anyone
they've had too much to drink.

193
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,187
- And Dennis Miller
ruined football.

194
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,989
- You're a natural.
- Thanks.

195
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,558
Listen, do you think
that maybe I could get

196
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,793
a little advance
on my paycheck?

197
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:59,062
Gretchen's been
really bummed out lately,

198
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,097
and I told her
I'd take her shopping.

199
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,432
Just, like, 100 bucks.

200
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:03,933
- I'll ask Stephanie
if I can.

201
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:07,404
- Ask me what?
- Jen wants an advance.

202
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:10,473
- Oh, there's no shame
in that, Jennifer.

203
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,275
- Didn't say there was,
Stephanie.

204
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:12,809
- Good for you.

205
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,345
Wayne and I are happy
to give you an advance.

206
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:15,779
- Great.

207
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,113
- This could be
a teachable moment.

208
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,214
- Ooh.
- A what?

209
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:21,084
- This is a great opportunity
to discuss money management.

210
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:23,086
Now, I don't know about you,
but the way that Wayne and I

211
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:26,856
manage our money
is that we don't spend money

212
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,425
that we don't have.

213
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:29,826
- Uh-huh.
- Does that make sense?

214
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:33,163
- Yeah. Excuse us. Wayne?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,566
- Can I just--
- yeah.

216
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:40,603
- Okay, so you have
way more experience with her.

217
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,972
When your wife talks like that,
how do you keep

218
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,708
from stabbing her in the eye
with an ice pick?

219
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,778
- I think about her naked.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,313
Yeah, I don't think
that's going to work for me.

221
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,916
- Yeah, I'm not sure
I'd be comfortable with that.

222
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:55,318
- Okay.
All right, great, thanks.

223
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,955
- My door is always open.

224
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:02,292
- You know what, that makes
a lot of sense, Stephanie.

225
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,527
- Great, this is gonna be fun.

226
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,362
- Super fun.

227
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,574
Dina?

228
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,175
- Oh, my God!
- What?

229
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,710
- I didn't know
you were working here.

230
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,145
- Hey!
- Oh!

231
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,280
Hi.

232
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,983
I have missed you so much.
How are you doing?

233
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,186
- Oh, I'm good.
I'm still working for u.P.S.

234
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:32,422
And pitching
for my women's softball team,

235
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,756
the L.A. lesbians.
- Right.

236
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,825
- Ladies like to put it
out there.

237
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,360
- Well,
how are you and Jeremy doing?

238
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,829
- Happily,
head-over-heels divorced.

239
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:41,865
- Oh, thank God.

240
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,766
I have been biting my tongue
for 15 years.

241
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,435
I never liked
that selfish moron.

242
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,205
- He's still the father
of my child, Jennifer.

243
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:49,839
- Yeah.

244
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,075
- I'm screwing with you!
He's a scumbag!

245
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,811
- Oh, God.

246
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,045
See, this is what I miss.

247
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,213
You know?
- Yeah!

248
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:58,748
- Remember when we used to sit
in my backyard

249
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,849
and smoking cigarettes...
- Yeah.

250
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,519
- And talking about our lives,
and I was going to be

251
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:06,456
the first American woman
in space till Sally ride--

252
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,258
- you got to let that go,
honey.

253
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,158
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

254
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,461
- You know, my mom said
something really weird.

255
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:15,398
She said that you didn't want
to come over for dinner.

256
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,736
-<i> What?</i> That's crazy.
- Yeah.

257
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:22,939
I mean, I totally get it, 'cause
my mom drives me crazy too.

258
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:23,773
- Yeah.
- She also made it

259
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,308
seem like you didn't want
to see me.

260
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,777
- Oh, pfft.
- You know, yeah.

261
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,745
- Oh, sh--I gotta--

262
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:32,282
I'm just--I'm late for this
thing that I gotta get to,

263
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,850
so, um--
- oh.

264
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,952
Okay, Dina,
this is really weird.

265
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:37,720
- What?
- Yeah, it's weird.

266
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:38,855
- No, it's not weird.

267
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,924
- It is.
Are we okay?

268
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,792
- Are we okay?

269
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,193
No, we're not okay, okay?

270
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,628
We're really not,
and we haven't been for years.

271
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,164
And if you don't know why,
that's part of the problem.

272
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,999
But your hair looks really cute
like that, okay?

273
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,202
Have a nice life.
- Dina.

274
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,505
Dina.

275
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,561
- Hi, is my mom in?

276
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:05,830
- No, sorry.

277
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:09,333
- Hi, sweetie, come on in.

278
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,373
- Mom, are you hiring
your patients again?

279
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,443
- Isn't lorna great?
- She just lied to my face.

280
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:20,878
- It's a coping mechanism.

281
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,547
She only does it
when she's feeling threatened.

282
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:25,783
Her family was a mess,
poor thing.

283
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,618
Bipolar father,
domineering mother.

284
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,021
Now she acts out sexually
with men she barely knows.

285
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:33,624
I can't really talk about it.

286
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,660
- Okay, listen,
can you take Gretchen shopping

287
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,628
for me after school today?

288
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,297
I promised her I would,
but I have this interview.

289
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,800
- Well, sure, honey.

290
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,170
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

291
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:49,039
- You made this out
to "what's the point"?

292
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,842
- Oh. Sorry.

293
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,915
Please don't ask me
if I'm okay again.

294
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,184
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

295
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:00,718
Do I look okay?

296
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,921
- You need to be in therapy.
You have anger issues.

297
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,856
- Why does everybody
keep saying that?

298
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:08,292
- I know you can't afford
therapy right now,

299
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:10,394
but I have a solution.

300
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:13,230
I'm willing to see you
for free.

301
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:14,331
Or maybe a little yard work.

302
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,134
- Are you nuts?
- Well, just some light weeding.

303
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:20,037
- Mom, I am not going to have
my own mother as my shrink.

304
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,605
I think Freud
would back me up on this.

305
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:25,142
- Freud. Who understands you
better than your own mother?

306
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:27,478
- Mom, you're not listening
to me. I said no.

307
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,813
- Give me one good reason
why not.

308
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:32,483
- Because you don't listen
to me!

309
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:36,687
- See, you can't.

310
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:40,524
- $250,000?

311
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:43,193
- I can work for less.

312
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:43,694
Way less.

313
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:48,799
- Doreen, she made $250,000
at her last job.

314
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,034
- Damn, I wouldn't lose
that job.

315
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,870
- You can't lose that job.
- That's the job you keep.

316
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:57,007
- I'm afraid we're fresh out
of our $250,000 jobs.

317
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,977
- Did you check
in the $250,000 job drawer?

318
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:06,584
- You know what?
It's not funny.

319
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:07,484
I lost everything.

320
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,420
I mean, I had to move back in
with my mother,

321
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,121
and I'm working for my brother
at his bar

322
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,657
with his crazy-ass wife,
my best friend hates me,

323
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,826
and my daughter is planning
her own funeral.

324
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:18,896
- Wow.
That sounds pretty rough.

325
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:21,999
- Yeah, well, it is.

326
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,201
- I'm so sorry.

327
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:24,935
Hey, Doreen, join us.

328
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:26,837
Jennifer's throwing
a pity party.

329
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,772
- Oh, I'll bring the kleenex.

330
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,609
- That's not fair.
- Nothing's fair.

331
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,678
I'm supposed to feel sorry
for you because you have to work

332
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,647
for your brother?
You're working.

333
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,816
You had to move back in
with your mother?

334
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,251
She took you in.

335
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,821
- You know what, you are
twisting everything around

336
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:47,558
and making it all sound...
Good.

337
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,961
- Hey, I found
the $250,000 jobs.

338
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:52,763
I was sitting on 'em.

339
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,900
- Sorry I'm late, guys,
but I had this little shred

340
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,770
of dignity still stuck to me
that I had to get rid of.

341
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:00,404
- Gretchen called.

342
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,740
She's mad at you for having mom
take her shopping.

343
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,875
- Of course she is.
- Do you want my advice?

344
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:06,644
- Your advice?
- Just say you do.

345
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,445
- I know
it's none of my business, but--

346
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:09,079
- are you kidding?

347
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:11,582
You know nothing about it,
and I didn't ask you.

348
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:12,983
Of course
it's your business.

349
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:15,986
- Okay,
loving the playful banter, guys,

350
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:19,189
but these beers
won't serve themselves, right?

351
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,191
Table seven.

352
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,530
- Seriously, Dina's table?

353
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:31,635
- I'm sorry, but you have to
get over your fear of lesbians.

354
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:34,772
It's the law now.

355
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:43,781
- Here you go, ladies.
I'm Jennifer.

356
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,949
Just let me know
if you need anything else,

357
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:49,253
like the chance to tell me
why you're so mad at me.

358
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:54,024
- Well, I asked for mozzarella
sticks about 20 minutes ago.

359
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:57,961
- Okay.
Anybody else?

360
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:58,762
Dina maybe?

361
00:15:58,764 --> 00:16:02,066
- Really?
You really don't know?

362
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,668
- Just tell me.
What?

363
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,172
What--

364
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:12,076
Dina!

365
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,345
Open this door!

366
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:17,381
- Ah! Jesus!

367
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:20,284
- Tell me what I did!
- You changed.

368
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:22,920
- I didn't change.
How did I change?

369
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,088
Oh! Oh!

370
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,557
Okay, that is--
ow! Ow!

371
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,727
You know what?
I am not giving up that easy.

372
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:33,564
- Whoa. What?
Hey! What?

373
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,168
- Okay, now,
will you just talk to me?

374
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,071
- I don't even know
where to start.

375
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:43,540
You remember when I was going
through all that horrible stuff

376
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,242
with Jeremy
and I was flipping out?

377
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:48,679
- Yeah, I sent you
a $200 gift certificate

378
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:49,346
to my massage therapist.

379
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:51,081
- Well, I didn't want
a massage therapist.

380
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:56,286
I wanted my best friend
to be with me and talk about it.

381
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:57,087
- You didn't use it?

382
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,557
- No, I used it,
but still, it pissed me off.

383
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,693
- Did he do
the "hands on fire" thing?

384
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:03,761
- Oh, my God, yes,
that was amazing.

385
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,596
- I know, you just melt.
It's my favorite.

386
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,431
It's like--
- no, but that's not the point.

387
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,266
You used to be
such a good friend to me,

388
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,034
and then you turned
into some stranger

389
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:15,706
who just throws money
at people.

390
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,575
- Oh, my God.

391
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:19,643
I did, huh?

392
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:22,846
- What happened to you?
- I don't know, I just--

393
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:27,951
I was making all this money
and having all this success.

394
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,953
And, I mean,
I really was the Sally ride

395
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:31,321
of investment banking--
- oh, my God!

396
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:36,193
Okay, I'm just saying. God.

397
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:41,431
I mean, I had
a lot of what I wanted,

398
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,301
but the truth is, I just--

399
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:48,172
I was still
really, really lonely.

400
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:52,109
Can't we just go back
to the way things were?

401
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,477
I mean, I know
you still like me.

402
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,212
You can't help it.
I'm awesome.

403
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,446
We both know that.

404
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:59,483
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

405
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,485
- Hello.

406
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,954
This is probably my fault
because we didn't go over it,

407
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:06,390
but bar policy is that
we don't usually take breaks

408
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:09,593
so soon after coming in late.
- Oh.

409
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:13,797
- Or in the parking lot
or in a friend's car.

410
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,134
You'll get this.
- Okay.

411
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,203
- Two words.
Hit and run.

412
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:21,471
- There's a dumpster
right there.

413
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,207
Nobody would know.
- Nope.

414
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,475
- Hmm.
- All right, get out.

415
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:27,644
- See, we can build on this,
right?

416
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:32,282
You can't live without me.
Don't kid yourself.

417
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,918
Hey, I'm gonna win you over.

418
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,856
- Now you sound like
my second baseman.

419
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:46,821
- Hey.

420
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,723
- Hey. You okay?

421
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,926
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

422
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:52,627
What can I get you?

423
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:55,196
Can I see a foam list?

424
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,766
You know what,
I've got it down pat now.

425
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:00,468
Watch.

426
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,337
- Hey, very nice.

427
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,439
- Thank you.

428
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:08,109
I've always wanted to do this.

429
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:10,411
Oh! That didn't work.

430
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:13,948
You know what, I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna hand you this one.

431
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,682
- No, come on.

432
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:17,752
- Really?
- Yeah, let her rip.

433
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:22,657
- Yay!

434
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,227
So I've gone from maximum
profits to minimum wage.

435
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:29,464
I work ten hours a day,
then go home, cook, clean,

436
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:33,301
take care of my kid,
which is crazy and exhausting,

437
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:33,835
and apparently,

438
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:37,338
is something that 33.7 million
single working mothers do

439
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,140
in this country every day.

440
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:42,243
So if I whine about missing
my housekeeper,

441
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:47,048
I am a giant douche bag.

442
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,317
I miss lupe.

443
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:55,456
- Thanks for the omelet, mom.
- Oh, no problem.

444
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,960
Was it as good
as the ones lupe--

445
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,629
- mom, don't.

446
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:04,766
It was really fun
going shopping with grandma.

447
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:06,467
Yeah, she told me
a lot about you.

448
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,803
She told me
about the shoplifting

449
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:12,240
and the drinking
and the pregnancy scare.

450
00:20:12,242 --> 00:20:15,276
But then she said she couldn't
really talk about it.

451
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,779
- She's my rock.

452
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:24,752
- Maybe this
was supposed to happen.

453
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:33,194
- Maybe, honey.
Maybe.

454
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,969
- There you are.

455
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,771
- Mom, we were kind of
having a moment here.

456
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:47,942
- Perfect.
Let's have a moment.

457
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:51,813
I don't think
you've ever seen these.

458
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:54,983
This is from when we sent
your mom to friendship camp.

459
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:56,718
She loved it.
- No, I didn't.

460
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,886
- She loved it.
See that big grin?

461
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,021
- That's Angela Schwartz.

462
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,624
- That's you.
- I didn't have braces.

463
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:07,662
- Never?
Who am I thinking of?

464
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:10,398
- Angela Schwartz.

465
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
- Who's Angela Schwartz?

466
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,302
- The girl in the picture!
