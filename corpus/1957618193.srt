187
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,637
I just put in one year rap.

188
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,872
All right, man.

189
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,974
All I know is that we in Daytona Beach

190
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,742
and it's time to get loose.

191
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,977
- I feel you on that, though, baby.

192
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,211
I feel you on that.

193
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,479
You know what I'm saying?

194
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,348
- You out here to get your freak on?

195
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,918
- See, I'm free now.

196
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,687
I free, so you never know.

197
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,755
- Girl you is crazy.

198
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,190
- You know its time to what.

199
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,192
- [Both] P A R T Y.

200
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,328
- And you know DJ Spankx is here.

201
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,529
- Oh DJ Spinx.

202
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,497
I just love me some DJ Spankx girl.

203
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,166
- The girl in the lobby said that he's having his record

204
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,635
release party tonight and you know see all

205
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,471
the football players and actors are here, too.

206
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,706
- Girl, we could party later.

207
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,008
First thing first, I need to go see my man.

208
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,045
- See your man?

209
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,246
Look, look.

210
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,015
You my baby cousin, I love you right

211
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,250
but you need to wake up.

212
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,319
Michael ain't called you in what, two months

213
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,088
and he wouldn't even tell you which hotel

214
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,355
he was staying at.

215
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,724
- He probably didn't know yet, Raynesha.

216
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,158
- Excuses excuses, girl.

217
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
- For your information, I called his mother

218
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,895
and she told where he was staying at.

219
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,731
- OK, miss freshman, OK.

220
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,833
- Man you know in about a couple hours, man,

221
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,202
the beach gonna be full of honeys.

222
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,971
Just lovely honeys.

223
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,506
- Yeah you right about that, my nigga.

224
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,908
Bitches gonna be everywhere, you know what I'm saying,

225
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,878
black bitches, red bitches, brown bitches,

226
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,113
know what I'm saying?

227
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,981
The beach gonna be packed with bitches.

228
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,217
- Just make sure you knock first

229
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,119
'cause he may be in there knocking boots

230
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,154
like H-Town if you know what I'm saying.

231
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,493
- Flyy, why they got to be bitches, man?

232
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,162
I mean why can't they be honeys and ladies

233
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,096
and something like that?

234
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,631
Why they got to be bitches?

235
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,868
- Hold up, Southboy, what kind of nigga is you, man?

236
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,604
You about to go to the NFL, dog.

237
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,838
Know what I'm saying?

238
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,473
Make that little $2,000,000 a year.

239
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,009
Get commercials, man, do shoe contracts,

240
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,678
the whole nine dog, you know what I'm saying?

241
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,180
Let me tell you what Flyy think.

242
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,482
I think any lady you meet right now

243
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,551
ain't gonna be no honey or no lady.

244
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,485
You know what I'm saying?

245
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,820
Just a straight up bitch.

246
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,054
Nigga, that's right.

247
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,092
Bitch, gold digging, foot dragging, bitch.

248
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,727
Know what I'm saying, dog?

249
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,062
- So what happened between you and Southboy?

250
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,697
- I don't want to talk about it.

251
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,299
- Why not, Ray?

252
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,867
I thought y'all was about to get married

253
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,335
and all that.

254
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,272
I remember everything was Southboy this, Southboy that.

255
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,073
Y'all was together since your freshman year

256
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,642
and now it's towards it the end of your junior year

257
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,976
and it's over just like that?

258
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,911
- Just like that.

259
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,078
I don't want to talk about it.

260
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,913
OK?

261
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,847
- All right.

262
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,315
- Look, I will tell you this.

263
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,917
You need to be careful with Michael

264
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,786
'cause ain't nothing out here in Daytona

265
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,788
but some booty shaking freaky girls this weekend.

266
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,356
- Ray, Michael loves me and nothing's gonna change that.

267
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,292
- Look look you my cousin, I love you,

268
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,960
but you're a freshman, you're just in puppy love.

269
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:41,761
- Ray, that's killer, all right,

270
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,995
me and Michael are cool.

271
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,463
- OK, see see, I'm through with it.

272
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,265
But let's go get our grub on but do me a favor.

273
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,300
Please let them pay for it,

274
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,334
do you hear me?

275
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,702
- Why you telling me this?

276
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,370
- 'Cause you pay for everything on the way down here.

277
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,805
Gas, food, all of that.

278
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,340
- Well Kenny charged the rental car on his credit card

279
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,576
so I thought we could at least pay for a few things.

280
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,911
- See, all I'm saying is this.

281
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,113
Let Southboy kick out a little bit.

282
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,548
If he decides to leave school and go pro

283
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,382
he'll be making a bank load of money

284
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,584
in a couple of months.

285
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,086
Make 'em pay, that's all I'm saying.

286
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,921
- Make 'em pay, then.

287
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,123
- And Flyy, you tripping man.

288
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,026
And you using Ebonics while you doing it, dog.

289
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,927
- Feel me, dog?

290
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,928
Do you feel me?

291
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,197
- Hey man, all I know, all right,

292
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,000
is that we in Daytona Beach, all right,

293
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,371
no reporters, no sports agents, no coaches.

294
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,139
Just fun and sun.

295
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,580
(bell dinging)

296
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,448
- Hello?

297
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,518
- What you want?

298
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,420
- I want a room.

299
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,157
- Can't you see that this is black spring break?

300
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,325
- Well yeah, I know that.

301
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,261
- And your ass still want a room?

302
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,428
- Well yeah.

303
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,665
- Well, all right.

304
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,500
I don't want to see your little white ass

305
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,768
jumping out the elevator screaming,

306
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,738
oh my God, I was attacked.

307
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,672
It was awful.

308
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,474
Five niggas jumped on me.

309
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,476
They took my bag, they beat me down,

310
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,711
they called me names, oh God.

311
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,647
Somebody call the police.

312
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,614
It was horrible.

313
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,316
Somebody call the police.

314
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,151
I think one of them was Tupac.

315
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,053
I think one of them was Big Poppa.

316
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,723
Oh God damn, why did I come to black spring break?

317
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,591
Why, why?

318
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,760
Why?

319
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,666
- Look here, boy, you in a whole heap of shit.

320
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,634
It's black spring break and it's a bunch

321
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,836
of niggas running up an down this beach here.

322
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,838
Let me show you what I mean.

323
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,274
See that there?

324
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,309
You gonna need it.

325
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,176
911.

326
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,712
Quick.

327
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,781
Watch it's all in the wrist.

328
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,848
Not all.

329
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,619
911, get his ass up out of here.

330
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,687
Let's go.

331
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,822
Make it quick, make a move.

332
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,424
Get the hell on.

333
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,725
Let's go.

334
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,328
Act like he ain't want to get up out of here.

335
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,663
- Excuse me, is there like, I mean like a problem here?

336
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,598
- Oh no, I'm just letting you know what the deal is, sir.

337
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,434
Now do you have a credit card?

338
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,301
- Well, yeah.

339
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,905
- Well, are you going to use the damn credit card?

340
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,174
- Well, first I need some information.

341
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,409
- Look, $85 for a single room,

342
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,044
$100 for a double room

343
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,479
and I need a $200 deposit.

344
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,981
- No, no.

345
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,782
I mean, I need to find out if there's somebody staying

346
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,317
here in the hotel.

347
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,652
- Well, what are you, some kind of cop or something?

348
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,920
Huh?

349
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,155
Haven't you all arrested enough niggas this year?

350
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,057
Now you got to come down to Daytona Beach

351
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,192
and arrest somebody and mess up

352
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,593
they little spring break, huh?

353
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,527
- No, OK.

354
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,062
No, you got it all wrong.

355
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,866
See, my name is Vinnie, OK, I'm a sports agent.

356
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,502
Here's my card.

357
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:48,047
I'm looking for a all American by name of Dayrun Southboy.

358
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,448
He's from Watson Howell University.

359
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,850
- Is he going to the NFL?

360
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,118
- You're damn right he's going to the NFL.

361
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,520
He's like the best of the hands on a tight end

362
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,888
since Kellen Winslow.

363
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,289
- Kellen who?

364
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,958
- It doesn't matter.

365
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,193
Just let me know, is he staying here in the hotel?

366
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,294
- What's in it for me?

367
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,967
Oh, shit.

368
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,602
This ain't no money.

369
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,638
Uh uh, you can't get no room number with this.

370
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,472
No, no.

371
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,707
Don't you know?

372
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,442
I got two kids at home and they daddy

373
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,044

374
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,980

377
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,019
I want my daddy.

378
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,621
I don't want to be a bastard.

379
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,724
I want my mama to make good money on her job.

380
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,093
Why white people don't tip her good?

381
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,728
$20 ain't shit.

382
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,530
Can't you hear my children screaming?

383
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,864
- Yeah, I can hear 'em screaming, all right?

384
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,099
Well here, here's 100 bucks.

00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,306
about an hour ago with one cute guy and two hoochies.

388
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,942
- Wait a minute.

389
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,378
I thought this hotel didn't take pets.

390
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,346
What's he doing with hoochies?

391
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,715
- You are dumber than you look.

392
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,018
A hoochie is a girl, got it.

412
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,535
- Well, wait a minute now.

413
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,838
See 'cause you ain't got to try to shine on me

414
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,575

00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,954
- Jesus, what is everyone here on the take?

419
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,990

00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,286
He got to Watson Howell.

430
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,720
Remember when they came to beat us?

431
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,589
- Girl, everybody came and beat our team.

432
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,990

00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,264

438

I'm talking about making him scream and holler, OK.

441
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,940
And sleep like a baby.

442
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,176
- Nigga, I think I heard you talking that same shit

443
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,111
the last time you was after a football player

444
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,914
and what happened to him, OK.

445
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,216
Uh huh.

446
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,550
- Shit, the problem was he was looking

447
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,085
for the same thing I was looking for.

448
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,720
- Which was?

449
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,188
- Dick.

450
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,289
- You ain't telling me nothing about that, girl.

451
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,524
- Girl.

452
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,725
He wasn't nothing but a peanut butter

453
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,227
pack of dookie lover, or whatever you want

454
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,695
to call it.

455
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,163
All I could do for him was show him another man.

456
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,598
- Enough about him.

457
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,767
Anyway, Neeka, how you gonna rope off Southboy?

458
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,035
Enough about him, OK.

459
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,238
- Lashawn, shit is different, OK.

460
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,174
And I got that hair back on right now.

461
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
And it's so crucial.

462
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,144
- How crucial?

463
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,882
- So crucial, straight up crucial real like that girl.

464
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,684

You ain't got no go sister.

466
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,053

00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:48,988
Hey yeah, it's me.

00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,823
Uh huh, oh yeah, yeah.

00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,992
Yeah Southboy's already here.

470
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,294
Already the center of attention.

471
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,829
(laughing)

472
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,431
Hoes and agents all over the place you see?

473
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah, look, look, look.

474
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,602

00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,471

476
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,007

00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,010
Yeah, oh yeah you right.

00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,113
Nobody can resist that man. (laughing)

Yeah but look, look you just get her down here.

OK?

482
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,720
Whatever it takes.

483
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,190
(laughing)

484
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,961
- So what's up big dog?

485
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,462
Who you want to play for, know what I'm saying,

486
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,431
the Dolphins, the Bears, the Steelers.

487
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,699
Who?

488
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,566
- Hey Flyy.

489
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,169
Know why I wear this, man?

490
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,003
- No, I don't.

491
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,371
I've been wondering.

492
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,141
- So I don't forget where I come from, man.

493
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,275
See what I'm saying?

494
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,511
I ain't never had shit, man.

495
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,381
So it don't really matter to me who I play for,

496
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,582
you know what I'm saying?

497
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,318
It ain't even about the money, dog.

498
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,186
As long as I get a chance

499
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,587
to start at tight end.

500
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,522
You know what I'm saying?

501
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,223
- I feel you dog, I feel you.

502
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,059
But I'm saying that when you get to be

503
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,661

504
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,731
I got one thing I want you to do for me, dog.

505
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,199
- What's that man?

506
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,168
- Man I want you to start a record company, dog.

507
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,303
I got some bombing ass shit, know what I'm saying,

00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,738

509
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,707
want to put me on, dog.

510
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,508
- Cool, you got my word on it.

511
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,277
You got it. - True dat, true dat.

512
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,912

514
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,250
- Man like I'm saying, man.

515
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,219
These record companies are flawed, dog.

516
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,856
Man, I sent 'em some shit, dog,

517
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,624
the motherfuckers, you know what I'm saying,

518
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,826
don't do, you know what I'm saying.

519
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,828
They say I sound too different, dog.

520
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,097
I tried accommodating them, man.

521
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,498
They said I sound like some other niggas,

522
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,367
you know what I'm saying?

523
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,335
I'm in a no win situation, dog.

524
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,807
- Fuck you doing, Flyy?

525
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,844
- Exercising, dog, exercising.

526
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,480
- Man how in the fuck is that exercising, man?

527
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,915
- You see how I curl it up, dog, back and forth?

528
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,319
- Flyy, I'm in training, man,

529
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,221
you know I can't be around this shit, man.

530
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,355
- Man, just repeat what I'm telling you

531
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,424
about the exercise, dog.

532
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,358
I curl it up.

533
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,360
Puff.

534
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,530
And a puff, know what I'm saying?

535
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,965
Then if I, another nigga was here,

536
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,899
I'd hand it to him, you know what I'm saying?

537
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,169
That's exercise, too.

538
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,103
Know what I'm saying?

539
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,005
- Hey man, you tripping man.

540
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,407
Get your ass ready to go, man.

541
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,108
We got breakfast with Ray and Cindy, man.

542
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,844
Get ready to go man, put some clothes on.

543
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,579
- All right, dog.

544
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,682
After I finish exercising, all right?

545
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,019
- See, now that's a tattoo.

546
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,320
That is a tattoo.

547
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,589
- That ain't no damn tattoo.

548
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,558
My boy Flyy got tattoos.

549
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,426
These niggas bullshitting.

550
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,794
Flyy, come on, dog.

551
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,395
Show your tattoos.

552
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,329
- See no real motherfucking.

553
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,631
- Show your tattoos, dog.

554
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,800
- Hold my shit.

555
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,901
- Let's see what Flyy got.

556
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,669
- Come on, Flyy, what's up?

557
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,503
Yeah.

558
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,438
- Let's see.

559
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,372
Flyy ain't got no tattoos.

560
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,807
- Damn all that bullshit.

561
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,676
My dog does, my dog got tattoos, you know what I'm saying?

562
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,544
Damn.

00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,946
- Stop. - They aight.

564
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,981
- Hey C, you like that?

565
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,149
- It's fine.

566
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,350
- She like them pretty motherfuckers.

567
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,119
She like them untampered with motherfuckers.

568
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,454
- You know you like them ripples.

569
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,354
- Like Michael.

570
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,956
- Hey where Michael at?

571
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,257
- Why y'all tripping?

572
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,058
- Flyy here.

573
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:13,892
Damn Michael.

574
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,726

575
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,561

576
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,395

577
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,229

580
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,199
- Mikey, I like him.

00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,166

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,101

Check this out, check this out.

584
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,836
I got some money.

585
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,636
You ain't see Mike this weekend.

586
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,704
That's what I'm saying.

587
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,172
- Anyway, anyway.

588
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,107
- [Southboy] Mike don't give a damn about you girl.

589
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,074
- Ain't see you in two months.

590
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,342
- He ain't come by the hotel.

591
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,443
He ain't come by the hotel.

592
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,644
He ain't answer your call.

593
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,879
What's up?

594
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,113
- His mama had to tell you where he was at.

595
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,181

00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,015

(man grunting)

619
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,898
- Damn that shit what y'all talking about.

620
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,166
Know what I'm saying?

621
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,634
Told his ass to be ready at 4:00 a.m.

622
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,870
He wasn't man, he missed the boat, man.

623
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,372
Fuck him.

624
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,740
- Man, Greg will be mad he ain't got a ride to Daytona.

625
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,874
- Hey hey, I don't see how he was

626
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,776
gonna fit in the car anyway.

627
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,610
- Know what I'm saying?

628
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,078
- He would have fit.

629
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:40,879
We probably should of waited for him a little longer.

630
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,581
- Look, we were ready.

631
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,882
He wasn't, fuck him.

632
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,717
- Man, I don't care what none of y'all say.

633
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,520
I still think that was Greg standing on the highway

634
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,821
trying to hitch a ride.

635
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,224
- Ray, that don't make any sense, all right.

636
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,859
We left the boy at school.

637
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,494
How we gonna see him on the highway?

638
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,730
- To me it looked like Greg there, I still wasn't sure.

639
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,565
- I'm telling you that was Greg.

640
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,799
That was him.

641
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,935
- I didn't see no Greg on the highway.

642
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,203
- Man shit.

643
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,072
Niggas ain't shit, niggas ain't shit.

644
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,307
Can't believe they me got into this.

645
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,474
It's hot as hell out here.

646
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,309
Niggas left me, man.

647
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,743
That's fucked up.

648
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,978
Man you.

649
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,179
I knew I should have took my ass to Harvard

650
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,748
or Yale or somewhere the hell away from this.

651
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,150
Man you wait, you wait.

652
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,485
I see Kenny Flyy, I'm-a fuck his ass up.

653
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,788
Southboy, Raynesha, Charity, all of them.

654
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,622
Fuck 'em!

655
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,658
Hey give a nigga a ride.

656
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,060
Hey!

657
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:28,994
Hey.

658
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,596
Come on give a nigga a ride.

659
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,498
I ain't OJ, I ain't gonna cut your ass.

660
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,334
Damn, man, damn!

661
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,603
- Oh man, that was good, that was good.

662
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,271
- [Flyy] Got me tight though.

663
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,238
- It was straight.

664
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,707
- Southboy? - Yeah, yeah?

665
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,641
- Look at them girls over there pointing at you.

666
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,376
- [Southboy] Who's that?

667
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,911
- You like my boy?

668
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,613
- Girl, he think all the girls are looking at him.

669
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,815
He's the football all American.

670
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,284
Day Southboy, Day Day.

671
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,986
(fake moaning)

672
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,487
- I know it hurt, Ray, but it's all good.

673
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,321
- It's all right.

674
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,789
- It's all good.

675
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,324
- Waitress. - Yes?

676
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,692
- Can I please get the check?

677
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,526
- Sure.

678
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,595
- Oh shit.

679
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,298
What y'all niggas paying for something?

680
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,766
Take a picture of this.

681
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,534
- Ray, I don't know why you tripping, all right.

682
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,603
Me and Flyy rented the car to get down here.

683
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,338
- Oh hold up.

684
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,240
Well Charity and myself fed y'all niggas

685
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,708
the whole way down here.

686
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,610
Gash up that little card.

687
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,946
And bought us taste at the truck stop.

688
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,114
Thank you.

689
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,715
- Well Ray, you wanted the new music.

690
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,351
I was perfectly fine listening to Flyy's demo tape.

691
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,285
- Weak.

692
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,120
- You liked it?

693
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:28,954
- Yeah.

694
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,122
I think you're good

695
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,890
but I got one suggestion for you.

696
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,325
- What's up baby?

697
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,593
- You need a fat track with a girl singing on it

698
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,595
while you rap back at that slamming.

699
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,130
- You know any young ladies that can sing?

700
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,698
- Charity can sing, she is the bomb.

701
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,899
- Chill, Ray.

702
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,368
- Girl you rode your skills, let it be known.

703
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,636
- Why you holding back, baby?

704
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,271
Flaunt your skills.

705
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,373
- Cash or credit card?

706
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:53,412
- That will be credit.

707
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,280
- Damn, Flyy.

708
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,815
How much money you got on that credit card.

709
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,051
- Enough to feed y'all greedy motherfuckers.

710
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,352
That's for sure.

711
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,920
- God damn, every time I turn around

712
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,422
you whipping that card out your ass

713
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,489
to buy something with.

714
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,757
- And there they go again.

715
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,859
Sweating Flyy about his god damn credit card.

716
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,194
Look, the crackers gave it to me.

717
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,562
I'ma use it, dog.

718
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,631
- Hey damn that man, you done bought everything

719
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,132
with this card, all right.

720
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,502
Everything from the CDs, the hotel rooms to reefer.

721
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,872
(laughing)

722
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,140
- Tell me something, Flyy.

723
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,242
How much interest do you put on your credit card?

724

- Well, there must be some kind of mistake.

799
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,330
He knew I was gonna be down here.

800
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,865
Can you call him downstairs for me?

801
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,466

- No, I do not want to leave no information.

820
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,005
If he's upstairs, why he can't come downstairs

821
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,240

822
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,941

No, no honey, I haven't seen him yet.

843
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,649
No honey, honey, no I'm just kidding, honey.

00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,219

861
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,794

00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,782

00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,016
Oh hell no.

910
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,984
Damn, shit!

911
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,422
I know this ain't happening to me.

912
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,524

00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,958

920
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,469
- Nigga got the runs.

921
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:25,837
Hey chili side,

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,672
I'm go and take a walk down on the beach, man.

923
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,673
I'll be on this end.

924
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,507
- All right, man.

925
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,375
- All right.

926
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,720
How's the prettiest girl on the beach?

927
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:44,756
(mumbling)

928
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,658
Chill, chill, Ray, it's just me.

929
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,659
- Hey Dayrun.

930
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:48,493
- Dayrun?

931
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,795
What's this Dayrun shit?

932
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,764
You ain't called me that since god knows when.

933
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,032
- Well everybody else calls you Southboy.

934
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,233
- You weren't everybody else though, right?

935
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,534
You're my girl.

936
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,969
- Oh your girl?

937
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,771
When I started getting treated like everybody else

938
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,606
I started acting like everybody else.

939
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,475
- Come on chill, Ray, all right.

940
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,342
Damn.

941
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,146
What's up girl?

942
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,380
You looked stressed out.

943
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,016
You want me to run you down today?

944
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,084
(laughing)

945
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,853
- I can handle it, OK.

946
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,020
You know I love attention.

947
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,755
Something I couldn't get from you?

948
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,990
- Ray don't even go there, all right.

949
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,592
- You know its true, Dayrun.

950
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,093
- True? - True.

951
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,428
- What we talking about true and trust, all that shit?

952
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,696
- Yes. - That's why you

953
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,532
go out there and fucked Terry Miller, huh?

954
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,501
You violated our trust, Ray.

955
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,171
- Don't tell me about trust, OK?

956
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,274
When every ho on campus has your telephone number.

957
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,444
You just got what, over 50 set of roses

958
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,379
and over 200 damn Valentine Day cards.

959
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,249
Besides, I told you it was something that just happened,

960
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,450
anyways, so leave it at that.

961
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,284
- Happened? - Happened.

962
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,552
- Happened?

963
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,753
Give me a fucking break, all right?

964
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,589
Hurricanes happen, car accidents happen.

965
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,491
You giving Terry Miller some pussy

966
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,260
ain't no shit that just happen.

967
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,361
(clapping)

968
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,197
- Are you hurt, Southboy, huh?

969
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,432
When every freak on campus is running behind you

970
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,235
day and night, Southboy, Southboy, Southboy.

971
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,205
- Ray, damn those other girls, OK?

972
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,507
All I wanted was you.

973
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,975
- Then why in the heck were you screwing them hos

974
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,143
if I'm the only one you wanted?

975
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,112
- Ray, I wasn't fucking nobody, all right?

976
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,280
Damn what they was telling you.

977
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,548
I wasn't fucking nobody.

978
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,816
I wasn't cheating on you.

979
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,553
- Don't worry about it, it's all right, OK?

980
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,988
Look, you'll be a multimillionaire in a few months,

981
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,425
you can have all the cars, and all the girls you want.

982
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,360
- Damn all that shit, Ray.

983
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,162
Damn that material shit, all right?

984
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,331
Fuck the cars, hos, fame.

985
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,566
It ain't about that, OK?

986
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,603
Me and you been together since our freshman year.

987
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,972
You should know me better than that by now.

988
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,342
- Better than that, better.

989
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,711
From the moment I met you,

990
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,847
I didn't lay my eyes on anyone else, OK?

991
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,184
I changed my life around for you.

992
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,452
Until-- - Until you

993
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,120
fucked Terry Miller.

994
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,155
- I told you it was an accident.

995
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,356
- Accident? - Accident.

996
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,158
- Back on this accident shit.

997
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,793
Tell you what, Miss Accident,

998
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,395
why don't you answer this question for me?

999
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,797
Was the dick good?

1000
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,099
No, no, I got a better question.

1001
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,200
Did you suck his dick?

1002
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,337
- How could you say something like that to me?

1003
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,638
- Fuck that, Ray, don't turn this shit around on me.

1004
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,973
You the one that fucked him. - Go to hell.

1005
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,307
- You the one that fucked him.

1006
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,508
- Damn, big dog, what's up, man?

1007
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,711
You got your people fire hot with you, man.

1008
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,879
- Ex-people, man, ex-lady, all that.

1009
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,648
- Whatever, dog, whatever.

1010
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,616
What's up?

1011
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,650
- Hey, camera ready?

1012
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,884
- Camera ready, dog.

1013
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,552
- Let's go look at some real hos, man.

1014
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,087
Damn this shit.

1015
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,688
- God.

1016
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,124
How could I be so stupid?

1017
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,693
Ray was right, he ain't about shit.

1018
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,264
I can't tell Ray, she'll never let me live it down.

1019
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,565
Oh my God.

1020
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,307
- Say, what you doing here?

1021
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,541
- I'm waiting on Michael.

1022
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,043
He's saying he might be running a little late.

1023
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,544
- You saw Michael?

1024
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,247
- Yep, I went over to his hotel room and I saw my baby.

1025
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,317
- I mean, was he glad to see you?

1026
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,154
Did he run up, pick you up, kiss you all over

1027
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,722
and tell you how much he missed you?

1028
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,724
- Act like you know, girl, he was going crazy.

1029
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,959
I told you, Ray.

1030
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,928
- I guess I was wrong about him.

1031
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,664
I thought he get around all these hoochie mamas

1032
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,300
acting like he don't know you or something.

1033
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,035
I guess you lucked out, baby cous.

1034
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,339
Now I wish Southboy had a little Michael in him.

1035
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,041
- Where is Southboy and Flyy?

1036
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,275
- Where do you think?

1037
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,878
Out there videotaping booty on the boardwalk.

1038
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,513
- Southboy got you acting crazy.

1039
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,981
- Oh, hold up.

1040
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,350
Since you found your man, you think you can give

1041
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,818
your big cousin advice, right.

1042
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,254
- Just an observation, just an observation, girl.

1043
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,057
- Since you trying to observe something,

1044
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,291
the beach is getting packed.

1045
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,726
Get your stuff.

1046
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,761
You can get Michael some coochie later.

1047
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,163

1082
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,715
- Oh, well, I represent over 50 NFL, NBA players.

00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,217
And I got a roster of musical groups,

1084
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,219

00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,844
for the release of his new album.

1098
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm gonna put y'all on the VIP list.

1099
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,315

1100
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,783
Thank you, Mr. Crooklin, that is the best thing

1101
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,717

1102
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,785

1103
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,221

Well, look.

I need you all to do me a little favor.

1106
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,961
Now, I need you to get Southboy up to my room

1107
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,496
no later than five o'clock.

1108
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,666
Now, I'm not gonna ask him to sign anything, you see.

1109
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,001
I just want to, you know, talk to him about

1110
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,671
the advantages of letting us represent him,

1111
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,840
if he decides to go pro, you know?

1112
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,709
Look, look, my room is 122.

1113
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,644
- All right, all right, we can do that.

00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,746
But right now, he out videotaping booty

(laughing)

1117
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,417
I'll make sure he get up there.

1118
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,319
- All right, all right, well, thank you ladies.

1119
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,422

1120
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,423
- All right.

1121
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,424
It's on.

1122
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,060
(laughing)

1123
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,762
(hip hop music)

1124
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,801

00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,106
That man gonna put them on the VIP list.

1128
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,007
We got to be in the VIP, OK?

1129
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,510
- You know what, don't even worry about it.

1130
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,577
Let's just get our ass down to the boardwalk

1131
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,846
and catch up with Mr. Southboy.

1132
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,382
- Jesus Christ, Billy the Crook.

1133
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,417
I got to get into that party.

1134
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:57,054

1135
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,867
(chattering)

1136
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,540
Hey, man, what kind of camera you got there?

1137
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:50,541
- A camera, man.

1138
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,577
- I mean, how does it work?

1139
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,345
I mean, does it feel good in your hand?

1140
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,847
- Hey, man, what's up, cameras turn you on or something?

1141
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,083
- No, man, it's nothing, I'm just curious.

1142
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,618
- Nosy is more like it.

1143
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,620
- Nosy, I like that, pretty funny.

1144
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,256
- We came down here to roam weekend,

1145
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,525
I thought it was supposed to be black spring break.

1146
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,429
- You know what, I think it is black spring break,

1147
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,663
you know what I'm saying?

1148
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,931
- Yeah, you know it is black spring break,

1149
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,433
because I heard it on the radio, man.

1150
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,568
It was like hey, Daytona Beach,

1151
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,304
are you ready for the true jam, you know?

1152
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,575
It was like hey, black spring break.

1153
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,478
Bass mixed music all around, it was the hottest groups

1154
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,182
in hip hop, there's gonna be red bows, black bows.

1155
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,784
There's gonna be, oh, man.

1156
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,187
Music gonna be provided by rap productions

1157
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,389
and face bottom DJ's.

1158
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,890
OK.

1159
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,926
You know what, ladies, if you want to make some money,

1160
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,996
you got to take it all off, yeah, woo.

1161
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,834
- This cracker done bumped his motherfucking head, Southboy.

1162
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,569
- What the fuck is your problem?

1163
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,304
- Whoa, man.

1164
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,306
Let me be straight with you.

1165
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,807
You're a big fella, right?

1166
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,509
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1167
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,777
Look, look.

1168
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,312
We ain't into that dookie love shit,

1169
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,413
you know what I'm saying?

1170
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,881
We're pussy lovers over here.

1171
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,116
- It ain't like that man, man, you got it all wrong, OK?

1172
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,183
It's nothing like that, all right?

1173
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,585
He's just a big boy.

1174
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,887
He must be playing like football some place.

1175
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,123
(sniffing)

1176
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,591
- I smell an agent.

1177
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,026
- No, man, I ain't no agent,

1178
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,427
I mean, I'm just like hanging out on the beach.

1179
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,728
- Let's jet, big dog.

1180
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,830
That little red seat right over there, man.

1181
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,499
- Yeah, I'm with you, man.

1182
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,533
- Know what I'm saying?

1183
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,634
- No, OK, OK, all right?

1184
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,269
I recognize you.

1185
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,639
You're Dayrun Southboy from Watson Howell University, man.

1186
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,708
Fuck, man, you're great, man.

1187
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,678
- Hey, look, I haven't made my decision yet, OK?

1188
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,346
But when I do, I think I want an agent

1189
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,814
that's at least six feet tall.

1190
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:40,117
- No, that's funny, man, I like that, I like you.

1191
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,753
Hey, let me start again, OK?

1192
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,355
My name is Vinnie DelVecchio.

1193
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,457
I'm with DelVecchio Sports Management.

1194
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,792
- So you do know who I am?

1195
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,793
- What, are you kidding me?

1196
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,494
Everybody knows who you are.

1197
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,163
You were the talk of the pro camp, man.

1198
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,365
All the scouts were going nuts for you.

1199
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,801
If you sign right now, man.

1200
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,235
You could make a fortune.

1201
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,905
- Yeah, my agent will make a fortune, too.

1202
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:01,839
Catch you later.

1203
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,107
- Hey, it was nice meeting you.

1204
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,675
We'll have lunch, OK?

1205
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:05,676
Check you later.

1206
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,780
- Hey, that cracker's a trip, man.

1207
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,048
- Who was that anyway, big dog?

1208
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,450
- He was an agent, man, just like you said,

1209
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,484
you know what I'm saying?

1210
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,618
God damn, man.

1211
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,253
Probably all over the place.

1212
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,421
- Probably.

1213
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,389
- Probably followed us down here.

1214
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,890
- Speaking of agents.

1215
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,326
- Charity. - We might as well tell him.

1216
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,828
- Tell me what? - Tell him, Ray.

1217
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,862
It's all right.

1218
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,297
- Tell me what, Ray?

1219
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,998
- We bumped into William Crooklin.

1220
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,433
- Crooklin?

1221
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,902
Damn, from Crooklin Sports and Enter, oh, man.

1222
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,205
Hey, what'd he say, what'd he say?

1223
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,372
- He wanted to meet you at five o'clock at his hotel.

1224
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,374
- Damn, man.

1225
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,976
- I heard about this cat, man.

1226
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,578
He got long, dog.

1227
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,512
- Hey, check this out.

1228
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,813
If I say our recruitment, right,

1229
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,181
I probably could play for whoever I want,

1230
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,683
you know what I'm saying?

1231
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,084
He's about to get me.

1232
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,619
- Hold up, hold up.

1233
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,254
I thought you didn't care what team you played for.

1234
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,690
- Hey, that was 'til you said William Crooklin.

1235
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,125
Tell her about Crooklin, man.

1236
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,594
- Crooklin, big time shit, he be on CNN

1237
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,362
and shit like that, you know what I'm saying?

1238
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,897
- Hey, check it out, right?

1239
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,532
If I sign with him tonight, you know what I'm saying?

1240
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,501
I probably could hold out at training camp.

1241
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,869
I probably get more money, too.

1242
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,137
- Wait a minute.

1243
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,338
I thought you said you never hold out

1244
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,773
at training camp, that you always want to

1245
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,474
negotiate honestly and quickly

1246
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,344
and playing the game was first and foremost, Southboy.

1247
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,279
- Hey, Ray, I love the game of football, all right?

1248
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,014
But damn, my agent just sat there and told me

1249
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,950
I could make $5,000,000 a year.

1250
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,086
- This doesn't sound like you. - Damn, what room he in?

1251
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,287
- I think he said 122.

1252
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,121
- 122.

1253
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:24,989
122.

1254
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,590
It's a trip, man.

1255
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,491
- Damn.

1256
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,626
- [Ray] I'm really confused.

1257
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,860
- What you confused about, Ray?

1258
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,095
- You said you always wanted a small agent

1259
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,630
to represent you so you get more attention

1260
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,599
and be a priority, instead of just another client, Southboy.

1261
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,602
- Hey, we're talking about William Crooklin, all right?

1262
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,137
All rules change for him.

1263
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,138
She don't understand.

1264
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,640
All rules change.

1265
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,074
- I hope this guy doesn't sweep you off your feet

1266
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,776
like you're some damn Prince Charming

1267
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,778
because it's business, Southboy, business.

1268
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,079
- Ray, Ray, Ray, chill.

1269
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,948
You just want to talk to this nigga, right?

1270
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,716
- Yeah, you ain't gonna sign nothing, right, Southboy?

1271
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,251
You know my dad's an attorney,

1272
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,020
so you're not supposed to sign no agent contract

1273
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,488
without no lawyer representing you, right?

1274
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,989
- Hey damn all that, all right?

1275
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,691
Y'all want to go get something to eat

1276
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,026
before I go see Crooklin?

1277
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,828
- Yeah, whatever. - Chicken shack down the road.

1278
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,129
- Look.

1279
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,564
We about to go to our room, get our purses.

1280
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,531
- Hey, we ain't got time for that shit, Ray.

1281
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,766
We ain't got time for that.

1282
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,334
- Look, look, look, ladies, ladies.

1283
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,169
I got my credit card, you know what I'm saying?

1284
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,838
Lunch on me.

1285
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,306
Y'all take care, all right?

1286
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,808
- Oh, thanks Mr. Credit Card Man.

1287
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,143
- Thank you, Flyy.

1288
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,211
- Mr. Credit Card Motherfucker now, huh?

1289
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,712
- Hey, hey, hey, damn all that.

1290
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,181
Let's just go, man, let's go.

1291
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,719

1292
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,956

1296
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,829

Honey, I'm just doing this to get into the meeting

1333

with the other agent and the player.

1334
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,110
Honey, your husband is not a tooty fruity.

1335
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,580
Do not tell me daughters that I'm a tooty fruity.

1336
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,749
Yes, honey, I make them wear condoms.

1338
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,555
I don't sleep with men.

Goodbye, I got to go.

(chattering)

1354
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,127
- He was about the sorriest motherfucker I ever had.

1355
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,195
That nigga was five seconds from being retired.

1356
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,463
- Willy.

1357
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,599

1358

00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,078
I need to go upside your damn head.

1363

about hot grits with Al Green.

1366
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,786
- See, that's why I told him all that.

1367
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:49,887
Get out of here.

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,222

- And you better pay me.

1388
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,669
Last time you skipped your ass out of here without paying.

You better pay me this time.

Can I take your order?

1398

And give me all the sugars, OK?

You got that kind of funds on your person?

1405

- Hell no.

1407
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,010

1408
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,512
Don't mind him, baby, OK?

Let's just leave it at the beach.

00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,509
Let's have some fun.

No.

He just put a french fry in that bitch mouth.

1424

Boy, I'm gonna go ahead and turn the Chicken Shack up.

Oh, Lord, I'm gonna be all right, I'm gonna be all right.

You wait.

00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,931

1431
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,532
- I see you out there on the beach.

1432
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,734
- You ain't seen this cat since Christmas.

1433
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,770
Y'all here in the same town.

1434
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,206

00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,013
I got to go see Crooklin.

1437
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,916

1438
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,918
- It was up, everything was lovely.

1439
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,153
Everything was lovely.

1440
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,056
- Good, good, well, that'll be 38.59.

1441
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,825
- Here you go.

1442
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,193
- Oh, you're gonna use your credit card.

1443
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,996
OK, well, let me just swipe it right here, OK?

1444
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,298
- I ain't never know a nigga to have a credit card

1445
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,500
that worked unless he was driving one of them

1446
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,271
Lecoosis, BWM's, or Mercecedes or something.

1447
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,472
(beeping)

1448
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:56,340
Oh shit.

1449
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,776
That ain't sound too good.

1450
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,347
- The thing say this card is declined.

1451
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,950
This transaction could be fraud.

1452
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,454
Please confiscate the card and call the police.

1453
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,822
- There got to be some kind of mistake.

1454
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,357
- Well, look, baby.

1455
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,558
That's what the machine say.

1456
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,960
So, we ain't gonna call the police,

1457
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,262
but you gonna have to pay for this food

1458
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,830
one way or another.

1459
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,065
- Well, if you ask me, I think we just hired

1460
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,300

1461
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,835
- Uh uh, I ain't washing no dishes.

1462
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,171
Raynesha Hawkins ain't washing nobody's dishes.

1463
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,441

I do not believe this.

1465
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,078
- Yeah, Flyy.

1466
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,346
Why didn't you call the credit card people

1467
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,982
and see if there's been a mistake or something?

1468
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,951
- A mistake, this ain't no mistake.

1469
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,786
Flyy done used that since he got it.

1470
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,055
- Hey, fuck it, all right.

1471

1474
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,031
- Yeah, tell me about it, Flyy.

1475
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,532
- Goodness.

1476
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,334
I can't believe we have to wash all these dishes.

1477
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,602
- Well, believe it.

1478
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,304

1604
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,143
- How you doing, how are you?

1605
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,979
- I'm all right, you know, busy and all that.

1606
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,180
- I dropped by the hotel and the lady said you was busy

1607
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,115
or something like that, what's going on?

1608
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,383
- That's your problem, Charity, you don't just

1609
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,785
drop by the hotel.

1610
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:42,719
You know, call first.

1611
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,020
Show a nigga some respect.

1612
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,422
- Respect, Michael, what are you talking about,

1613
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,857
I'm your high school sweetheart, you're my boyfriend.

1614
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,459
- Charity, it's a new day, all right?

1615
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:50,660
You're at your school doing your thing,

1616
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,796
and I'm at my school doing my thing.

1617
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,364
So you know we both got a thing going on.

1618
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,799
So I don't know why you tripping.

1619
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,101
- But I'm not seeing anyone else but you, Michael.

1620
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,869
I'm not talking to any guys at school, baby.

1621
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,104
I'm all yours.

1622
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,372
- I don't know that, Charity.

1623
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,473
I don't know what you're doing at your school.

1624
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,941
Look at you.

1625
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,209
I bet you get all kind of niggas hanging on you.

1626
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,712
Man, go and fuck Charity somewhere else.

1627
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,146
- Michael, this doesn't even sound like you.

1628
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,615
What's wrong with you?

1629
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,415
- Hey, Charity, I want something new and improved

1630
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,216
right now, all right?

1631
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,618
- New and improved?

1632
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,485
- Yeah, meet Sue.

1633
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,621
We met at school.

1634
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,189
This is the girl of my dreams.

1635
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,291
This is all the woman I ever want.

1636
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,626
- Michael, how could you do this to me?

1637
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,894
- Charity, I ain't returning your phone calls,

1638
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,129
I ain't answering your letters,

1639
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,864
I thought you'd get the picture by now, bitch.

1640
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,733
- You can ask Raynesha, I haven't been cheating on you

1641
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,735
or nothing like that and you're gonna come to Daytona

1642
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,969
with this bitch?

1643
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,137
- Bitch, hold up with that-- - Hold up.

1644
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,739
- You ain't shit, Michael, you ain't shit.

1645
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,940
I don't need you no more.

1646
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,341
I wasted all my time with you, motherfucker.

1647
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,877
You owe me, you owe me. - It's all right.

1648
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:41,711
It's all right.

1649
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,279
Charity.

1650
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:46,182
Why did you lie to me about going to see Michael?

1651
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:49,386
- Because I didn't want to hear you say I told you so.

1652
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,488
- You my cousin, so what if I ride you a little bit?

1653
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,189
That's my job.

1654
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,591
You didn't have to lie to me about

1655
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,092
going to see a punk like that.

1656
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,062
- You're 100% right, Ray, I'm sorry.

1657
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,463
I know we're much closer than that.

1658
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,666
- Yeah, Charity, much closer than that.

1659
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:06,603
Look.

1660
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,871
It's been a long day, OK?

1661
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,907
Let's forget about it, OK?

1662
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,343
- OK.

1663
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,711
I'm sorry, I love you, girl.

1664
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,513
- I love you, too.

1665
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,915
- Well, that's the story of

1666
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,583
Crooklin Sports and Entertainment.

1667
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:24,521
You see, I can get you into film, commercials,

1668
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,189
all of that.

1669
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,558
Just as soon as you sign with me,

1670
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,927
and I hope that's gonna be tonight.

1671
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,697
- I got some good shit.

1672
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,500
Bitch, I don't know if I can smoke all this shit,

1673
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:40,603
but I'm gonna damn sure try.

1674
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,548
- Well, I'm really impressed with your agency, Mr. Crooklin.

1675
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,483
I think you guys could do wonders for my career.

1676
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,419
- Well, good, good, good, I'm glad to hear that.

1677
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,321
Hey, that's wonderful.

1678
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,522
(laughing)

1679
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,724
- That's cool, that's cool.

1680
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:01,591
- Yeah, yeah.

1681
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,061
- But could you just shoot straight with me

1682
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,463
for a minute, Mr. Crooklin?

1683
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,865
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1684
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,400
What, what, what?

1685
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:13,336
- I mean, how high do you really think I can go

1686
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,971
in the NFL draft?

1687
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,875
- Oh, well, Southboy, they've already told me

1688
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,211
no less than third. - Damn.

1689
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,412
- Yeah, no matter what.

1690
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,782
Man, the way you put up them numbers this season

1691
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,485
and the way you performed last week at that camp,

1692
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,454
man, you already in the driver's seat.

1693
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,956
(laughing)

1694
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,958
- That's good to know, that's good to know.

1695
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,326
God.

1696
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,596
- Hey, look, tell me, tell me Southboy.

1697
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,497
You engaged?

1698
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,533
Got a girlfriend, you know?

1699
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,801
Anything of that nature?

1700
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,104
- Remember that girl you met today, Raynesha?

1701
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,273
- What's the real deal, you're still not

1702
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,541
telling me nothing.

1703
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,943
- Look, see, I don't know, I don't know.

1704
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,279
Look.

1705
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,481
I guess I started to feel ignored.

1706
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,383
It seemed like every girl on campus

1707
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,585
knew where my man was but me.

1708
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,187
I was starting to get pissed off.

1709
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,023
I thought I was the laughing stock of the campus.

1710
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,992
So I tried to get Southboy's attention.

1711
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,028
I did what you did today.

1712
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,264
- What was that?

1713
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,300
- I lied.

1714
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:26,009
I told Southboy I had sex with Terry Miller.

1715
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,310
- Raynesha. - Look.

1716
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,078
I was lonely, I tried to get his attention.

1717
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,580
- Like that?

1718
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,615
- Look, I gave him this excuse about it being an accident,

1719
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,117
but he didn't buy it.

1720
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,652
Now he thinks I'm some slut or something.

1721
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,822
But nothing happened between me and Terry, nothing.

1722
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,158
- You sure you ain't sleep with Terry Miller, girl?

1723
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,128
- Look, hold up, Raynesha Hawkins may talk a lot of mess,

1724
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,896
but that's one thing I would never do to my baby

1725
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,997
is cheat on him.

1726
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,567
Because I love him too much.

1727
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,336
- She cheated on me with the star basketball player.

1728
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,704
(laughing)

1729
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,105
We just friends now.

1730
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,676
- Yeah, well, Southboy, look.

1731
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,411
I think I got a little something something

1732
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:05,148
that's gonna take your mind off of all of that.

1733
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,115
- Yeah?

1734
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,150
- Mm hmm.

1735
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,084
Oh, Sherry.

1736
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,155
(hip hop music)

1737
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,812
- [Flyy] Oh, motherfucker.

1738
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:40,850
♪ I can see clearly now that my high is off ♪

1739
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:49,192
♪ I can allude all obstacles in my way ♪

1740
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,530
- [Crooklin] Yeah, that Sherry is something else, huh, huh?

1741
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,966
- [Southboy] Hey, she all that, man, she all that.

1742
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,134
(laughing)

1743
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,569
- Yeah, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

1744
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,803
(knocking)

1745
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,038
Sherry, look, man, don't hurt him now.

1746
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,807
Now he's still got to play some football, huh?

1747
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,977
Y'all have some fun and I'm gonna go and get this door.

1748
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,584
- Hey, I'm here just to dust for ya.

1749
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,319
Hopefully I'm not interrupting.

1750
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,553
- Hey, hey, hey.

1751
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,255
Nobody asked you to come in and dust, come on.

1752
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,390
- Oh my God.

1753
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,592
There's a fire, there's a fire.

1754
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:25,028
(chattering)

1755
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,464
Don't worry about me, let me save you.

1756
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,899
I'll save you all.

1757
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,335
(chattering)

1758
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,712
Hey, don't worry about a thing because I saved us all.

1759
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,947
(laughing)

1760
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,381
- Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1761
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,216
Now you ain't no damn maid.

1762
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,319
You a man, now who the hell are you?

1763
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:51,621
(coughing)

1764
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,726
- This some of the best shit I ever smoked.

1765
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,927
(coughing)

1766
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,029
- Damn, hey, that's that damn agent

1767
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,831
from the boardwalk today.

1768
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:02,699
- Damn sure is.

1769
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,535
- Oh, no, see, you gonna have to get the fuck out

1770
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,137
with your stank white ass, come on.

1771
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,440
(laughing)

1772
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:16,012
- Hey, Southboy, popped his motherfucking head.

1773
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,247
- Hey, hey, hey, I can't believe he was dressed

1774
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,750
like a maid, dog.

1775
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,585

01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,988
The limo is gonna be here at nine o'clock

1806
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,008

This is gonna be easier than I thought, mm hmm.

1812
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,088
You know that Southboy kid?

1813
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,790
He's pretty stupid.

1814
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,992
Yeah, I thought he was gonna be a tough guy

1815
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,095

1816
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,463
Thinks with his dick.

1817

1828
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:10,259
No, my room was not on fire, I said I put a fire out

1829
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,195

1830
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,630
No, I'm not a fireman now.

01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:18,768
No, God damn it, no, I am a sports agent,

01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,269
I am not a fireman.

1833
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,138
Yes, I know I got to go to school for that.

1834
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,773
What are you, nuts?

1835
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,342
No I did not race in there to save my boyfriend.

1836
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:29,779
Honey, I don't have a boyfriend, Jesus Christ.

1837
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,048
All right, Billy the Crook, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

1838
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,116

1901

- Man, Spankx don't know what he talking about, man.

All I'm saying is you need to get him checked out first.

2063
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,691
He tried to get one of them record contracts.

I'm gonna tell you straight.

2067

I want to introduce you to this homeboy here.

2074
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,241
Daniel Zirelli, from LA, man.

2075
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,176
That's my man does all my videos and all, right?

2076
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:16,612

2077
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,713
- Yeah, you vibing up that shit?

2078
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,181
- Yeah, I am, man.

2079
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:20,249
Next time I'm in town, maybe I'll do your video.

2080
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,151
- Damn. - Boy, I tell you, man.

2081
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:24,553
- I heard Southboy's fucking with Crooklin.

2082
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,021
That shit's a mistake.

2083
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:26,855
- Look at this, Southboy.

2084
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,159
Now, I know Flyy.

2085
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,493
Flyy is your main man.

2086
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,696
I know that.

2087
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,198
But once you become part of the Crooklin family,

2088
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,534
you see, well, then you're gonna have to get you

2089
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,302
some new main men.

2090
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,304
You know what I mean?

2091
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,106
- You mean like get some new friends?

2092
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,408
- Mm, mm, no, no, no.

2093
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:47,276
(laughing)

2094
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,777
No, absolutely not.

2095
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:53,215
See, no, you know, see, you gonna be a pro ball player, see?

2096
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,219
With lots of resources.

2097
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:01,757
So you need to hang around folks who are just like yourself.

2098
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,958
- I can't believe that guy gave Southboy

2099
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,094
all that jewelry.

2100
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,429
- I can't believe he's actually taking a drink.

2101
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,232
- As long as I've known him,

2102
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,967
I've never known him to take a drink,

2103
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,268
smoke a joint, or anything like that.

2104
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,871
Southboy is tripping.

2105
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:20,075
- Look, look, look, Raynesha and Charity there.

2106
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,544
No, no, no, they can't compare to Sherry.

2107
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,381
Sherry.

2108
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:28,050
Sherry is the type of woman that you need on your arm.

2109
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,686
Not them two tramps you drove down here with.

2110
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,054
You see what I'm saying?

2111
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,056
- Yeah, I see what you're saying.

2112
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,391
To be honest with you, Mr. Crooklin,

2113
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,126
I'm tired of all of 'em.

2114
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,394
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

2115
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,229
Yeah, well, see, that's only natural, Southboy.

2116
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:45,267
You see, money, money hangs with money, you see?

2117
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,202
(laughing)

2118
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:48,437
Yeah, you see.

2119
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,773
You never heard of no pro ball player driving

2120
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,708

2121
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,643

2122
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,712
No, you see that.

2123
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,647
That just don't happen.

2124
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,216
- I see where you're coming from.

2125
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,217
- Yeah.

2126
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,786
- You know what?

2127
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,587
I think that Crooklin guy's a bad influence on Southboy.

2128
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,090
- For an ex-girlfriend, you sure sound concerned.

2129
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:09,792
- See.

2130
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,527
I do miss him a lot, OK?

2131
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:13,962
This has been part of my life.

2132
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,233
- So what you gonna do about it?

2133
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:20,869
- Do about it?

2134
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,572
I'm gonna get my man back tonight.

2135
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:24,440
Come on.

2136
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,811
- If you ask me, I think you need to

2137
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,714
dump that whole crew I seen you with this morning,

2138
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,583
you see, including that Kenny Flyy.

2139
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,219
- Word to your mother, man, tell him we'll do it, man,

2140
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:40,122
if your friend make him understand you, man.

2141
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,523
Crooklin gonna rob his ass, dog.

2142
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,192
- Yeah, if you see that fucker Crooklin,

2143
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,827
tell him he better give me my money,

2144
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,728
or else he's gonna be waking up with a horse head

2145
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,030
in his bed, I'm serious.

2146
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:51,133
- Hey, man, I don't know, Crooklin got this nigga

2147
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,936
nose wide ass, you know what I'm saying?

2148
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:55,804
- Telling you, man, got to make him understand.

2149
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,339
It's important, dog.

2150
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,241
- Nigga hard headed, dog, you know what I'm saying?

2151
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,510
- Hey, man, hard head make a soft ass, man.

2152
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,011
Can't tell you, you know what I'm saying?

2153
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,513
Can't stress it.

2154
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,515
- Gonna go solo, man, I'm gonna go hard at him,

2155
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,516
you know what I'm saying?

2156
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,751
- Do what you got to do, boy.

2157
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:11,186
- Southboy.

2158
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,721
You more than that, hmm?

2159
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:18,093
You about to be a pro ball player.

2160
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,129
(laughing)

2161
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,165
- I feel ya, I feel ya. - Yeah, yeah.

2162
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,701
- I said a night club.

2163
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,405
No, I'm not dancing for money, honey.

2164
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,873
I'm looking for Southboy.

2165
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,108
What are you nuts?

2166
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:35,444
No, I didn't say little boys, I said Southboy,

2167
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,379
that's the player's name.

2168
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,082
(hip hop music)

2169
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,919
- Oh, shit, there goes Southboy right there.

2170
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,121
Oh, yeah, it's on, it's on.

2171
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,792
- Girl, Southboy standing over there all by himself.

2172
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,361
It's time to go make your move, OK?

2173
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:53,629
- I know that.

2174
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:56,064
Damn agent going over there talking to him.

2175
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,267
- Girl, every bitch in this place want that boy.

2176
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,102
If you don't go over there now,

2177
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,304
you'll never be able to have Mr. Southboy.

2178
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,239
- You know what, I'm gonna get his ass high, look.

2179
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,041
- Nigga, you gonna get his ass,

2180
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,276
and take him to the room,

2181
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:08,610
and fuck the shit out of his ass,

2182
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,412
for you and for me, OK?

2183
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,513
- You know what?

2184
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,348
I look damn good.

2185
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,752

- Who's the cat from the beach earlier today?

2203
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,768
The police called him, I guess that's a good thing,

2204
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:10,205
but all my boy thought about was playing football,

2205
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,908
that was the most important thing in his life.

2206
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,843
Now it may all be taken away.

2207
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:19,147
Doc, Doc, how is Dayrun, Dayrun Southboy?

2208
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,415
- Oh, oh, yeah.

2209
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,683
They're just finishing up with him.

2210
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,018
He'll be out any moment.

2211
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,121
- See, he's gonna be OK.

2212
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,490
- Yeah, we got to stop shooting each other over the BS.

2213
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:30,692
That cat was just jealous of Dayrun.

2214
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:32,094
Just jealous.

2215
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,462
- And Raynesha was just about to go tell him

2216
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:34,663
how much she loved him.

2217
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,701
- Hey, here's your all American.

2218
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:43,772
- Are you OK? - Yeah.

2219
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,643
- How you feeling, playboy?

2220
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,777
- Everything's cool.

2221
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,245
- Yeah? - Everything's cool.

2222
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,681
- He was lucky, the bullet passed clean through.

2223
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,849
That's what we call a flesh wound.

2224
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,183
I'm gonna keep him tonight,

2225
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,286
but tomorrow I'll give him some crutches

2226
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,553
and let him go.

2227
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,922
- Thanks, Doc.

2228
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:03,058
- Thank you, Doctor. - Good looking out, Doc.

2229
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,928
- Doc, can I have a few minutes with my friends?

2230
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:06,962
- Oh, sure.

2231
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,130
We're gonna do some rounds.

2232
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,798
I'll come back for you, OK?

2233
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:10,866
- All right.

2234
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:15,137
(chattering)

2235
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,406
So where's Ray?

2236
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,408
- She couldn't take it,

2237
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,742
so she's at the hotel packing.

2238
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,110
So I came instead.

2239
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:26,982
- So where's Crooklin?

2240
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:28,850
- Man, I hate to say I told you so, man,

2241
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,752
but the cat was a crook.

2242
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:31,954
- While you were passed out,

2243
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,622
he came and took all the jewelry he gave you

2244
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,791
and ran out the door with that damn tramp.

2245
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,993
- Said something about you being a wounded horse,

2246
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,429
wasn't no good to him no more, you know?

2247
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:41,930
- Wait.

2248
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:44,066
So how did I get to the hospital?

2249
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,234
- Man, Vinnie brought you to the hospital.

2250
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,869
And jumped on the guy with the gun

2251
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,972
and held him down 'til security came.

2252
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,540
- Damn. - Vinnie did all that for you

2253
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,742
and that Crooklin didn't even come to the hospital

2254
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,712
to see if you was dead or alive.

2255
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:57,946
- Damn.

2256
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,381
Wait a minute, so where's Vinnie?

2257
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,950
- He's at the police station, man, filing a report.

2258
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,453
So what you gonna do, man?

2259
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,658
- Man, when I was in there talking to the doctor,

2260
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:10,792
made my decision.

2261
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,664
God gave me talent, I'm gonna use it.

2262
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,399
- That's right.

2263
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,335
- No more fucking around, I'm turning pro.

2264
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,403
- That's good.

2265
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,238
- How about this, big dog?

2266
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,873
- I need that, man.

2267
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,409
I need that.

2268
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:31,680
Thanks, Flyy.

2269
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,782
- Any time, big dog, any time.

2270
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:34,650
So.

2271
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,853
What's up with you and Michael?

2272
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,154
- I ain't thinking about Michael no more, man.

2273
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,356
I'm tired of running behind that boy.

2274
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,392
- Good, 'cause you don't have to run no more anyway.

2275
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,760
You got a new nigga.

2276
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,197
- Why you looking at me like that?

2277
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,066
- How about being Flyy lady?

2278
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,000
- You gonna be OK?

2279
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,568
- Oh, I'm gonna be straight.

2280
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,203
Why don't y'all go and discuss details?

2281
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:02,277
(hip hop music)

2282
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:04,813
- Dayrun, are you all right?

2283
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,647
- Yeah.

2284
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,449
I'm cool, Ray, I'm cool.

2285
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,451
Just a flesh wound.

2286
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:10,986
Went right through me.

2287
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,522
Nothing's wrong, I can play the football.

2288
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,824
Got to say this, though.

2289
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,392
- OK.

2290
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,495
What happened to, where's Flyy and C?

2291
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,899
- Got a little thing going on.

2292
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,201
- What? - Yeah.

2293
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,136
Look, look, Ray, forget about that.

2294
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,304
I want to apologize to you.

2295
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:30,172
- Dayrun.

2296
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,609
Let me apologize to you, OK?

2297
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,613
I haven't been very supportive, whatsoever.

2298
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,615
I realize you have a lot of pressures on you

2299
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,017
for being a football star.

2300
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,686
I just thought you were looking for

2301
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,122
some cheerleader or something so I started acting childish.

2302
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,160
- Ray.

2303
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,965
I don't know if I ever could forgive you

2304
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:58,767
for having sex with Terry Miller.

2305
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,136
I mean.

2306
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:03,505
I can't not ever forget that.

2307
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:05,974
- Honey, that's just it.

2308
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:09,044
I never slept with Miller.

2309
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:12,547
I haven't been with any other man

2310
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,016
since you laid eyes on me our freshman year.

2311
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,753
I lied to make you jealous.

2312
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:22,357
And just think, I may have never had

2313
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,892
had a chance to tell you.

2314
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,328
Never. - Damn.

2315
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,763
I mean.

2316
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,899
You went to that extreme, I must have really been tripping.

2317
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,667
- Oh, yes, so, Mr. Southboy,

2318
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,303
your butt was definitely tripping.

2319
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:40,041
- This shit has got me spinning, man.

2320
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:40,909
Money.

2321
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,512
Pro football.

2322
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,616
It's scary.

2323
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:48,483
- Yeah.

2324
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,320
- You know, I was thinking.

2325
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:53,522
I don't think I want a girl

2326
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,458
that might just want me for my cash.

2327
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,762
And of course I need an accountant.

2328
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:03,298
So you know what I'm saying?

2329
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,401
- So, what are you saying?

2330
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,839
- I'm saying, how would you like to be my wife?

2331
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:14,409
How does Raynesha Southboy sound?

2332
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,413
- Yes, yes, Southboy.

2333
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:19,514
- I love you.

2334
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,752
No more lying to each other.

2335
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:24,753
- No more lying to each other.

2336
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:25,787
- No more lying to each other.

2337
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,323
- No more lying to each other.

2338
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:33,762
- I have you all here today to announce

2339
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:37,365
that I'll be foregoing my final year of eligibility

2340
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:42,404
at Watson Howell University to enter into the NFL draft.

2341
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:49,244
I made this decision after a careful self analysis

2342
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:52,681
of my skills and accomplishments,

2343
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:57,485
and I feel that I can be an immediate impact

2344
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,722
for any teen that would welcome me.

2345
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:07,395
Last night, I also realized the true meaning

2346
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:11,933
of friendship and trust.

2347
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:20,809
Once again, Dayrun Southboy, from Watson Howell University,

2348
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,344
will be turning pro.

2349
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,313
If you have any questions,

2350
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,515
you can speak with my agent,

2351
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:28,783
Vinnie Carusso.

2352
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,719
- My boyfriend did not shoot him, OK?

2353
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:32,654
I'm not cheating on my boyfriend, all right?

2354
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,222
Because I don't have a boyfriend.

2355
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,424
But I did get the job, OK?

2356
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,894
Not a blowjob, the job.

2357
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,131
OK, yeah, Dayrun signed with me last night.

2358
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,200
I'm a real fucking sports agent.

2359
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,902
No more fucking used cars, OK?

2360
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:48,770
- Come here.

2361
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:54,876
See, you about to get on my last nerve

2362
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,077
with that damn bullhorn.

2363
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,047
- What you mean?

2364
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,616
- What I mean is you pissing me off.

2365
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,285
Nipping around here like you the principal

2366
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:06,154
of some rowdy behind high school or something.

2367
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,522
- Yeah?

2368
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,057
I'm just trying to--

2369
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,326
- What you trying to do is make me act like a nigga

2370
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,627
on this here job.

2371
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,863
Just like I done on the one before this one

2372
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:16,298
and the one before that one.

2373
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:17,599
- Now, look here.

2374
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,503
I don't tell you how to check folks in in here.

2375
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,405
So don't you come tell me

2376
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,340
how to keep 'em safe.

2377
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,375
- Southboy, don't worry about a thing.

2378
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,811
I'm gonna be the best damn agent you ever heard of.

2379
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:30,679
- Hey, cool, Vinnie.

2380
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:31,880
Hey, I appreciate that.

2381
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,949
You know, don't forget to get to get Flyy

2382
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:36,117
a recording contract, it's real important.

2383
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,319
- I got that shit covered, man.

2384
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,553
- All right, cool, cool.

2385
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,021
Look, I'm gonna haul ass to school, all right?

2386
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,690
As soon as I get there, I'll call ya,

2387
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:42,891
we'll get ready for the draft.

2388
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:43,959
- Rocking.

2389
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,126
- Later, V.

2390
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,561
- Later, D.

2391
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:49,464
- Now, so far as I'm concerned, you little flashlight cop,

2392
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:52,133
you ain't nothing but a certified 911 dialer.

2393
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:57,405
- Security guard is very, very important.

2394
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:58,473
- Important?

2395
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:01,476
Y'all ain't even got no TV show.

2396
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,311
Everybody got a TV show.

2397
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,713
They got Cops.

2398
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,214
They got FBI Stories.

2399
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,283
Everybody got a TV show but I ain't never seen

2400
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:11,052
no TV show about no security guard, huh?

2401
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:12,787
I ain't never seen no camera crew following you around

2402
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,024
asking you what it was like to be a security guard, huh?

2403
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:18,326
Man, get up on out of my face before I about to tell you

2404
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,496
about that tight ass suit they got you wearing.

2405
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:24,566
Looking like a 1975 Greyhound bus driver.

2406
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,503
- Sup, home boys?

2407
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,939
(chattering)

2408
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:35,844
Check this out, here, check this out.

2409
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:36,745
Y'all see this?

2410
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:38,480
See this?

2411
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:41,916
(chattering)

2412
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,218
Let's ride, baby, let's ride.

2413
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,452
You know what I'm saying?

2414
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:45,887
- Woo, this has been a hell of a weekend, huh?

2415
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,122
- Got that right.

2416
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,189
Got my heart broken and fell in love,

2417
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,191
all in the same weekend.

2418
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:52,727
- Damn right.

2419
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,930
- Let's ride, dog, let's ride.

2420
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:56,931
You know what I'm saying?

2421
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,433
Ride, baby.

2422
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:01,136
(hip hop music)

2423
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,406
- Hey, you ain't leaving me here, no.

2424
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,307
Hey, I'm gonna get you, Flyy.

2425
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,308
Hey, man.

2426
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:10,111
Man, Raynesha, hey, wait.

2427
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,280
That's fucked up.

2428
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,816
Hey, Flyy, hey Southboy.

2429
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:15,683
Raynesha.

2430
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,920
