1
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,655
Sometimes it scares me to think

2
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,391
where it's coming from,
you know?

3
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,193
Like...

4
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,796
there's someone else
inside there, not me.

5
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,834
Well...

6
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,436
what if I...

7
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,271
what if I...

8
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,606
what if I lose it
and never get it back?

9
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,711
What would I do then?

10
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,559
Take a listen to this again,
I wanna...

11
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,657
do something with it.

12
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,128
Um... I've got...
I think I've got it.

13
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,564
The music part,
it worked out in my head, but...

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,741
I don't know anything else
except that it should...

15
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,506
it should sound like,
you know, a cry, but...

16
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,342
in sort of a good way
or something.

17
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,779
I want these voices at the end
just to...

18
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,547
sound...

19
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,606
<i>All right, Chuck,</i>
<i>let's have it.</i>

20
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,647
<i>We don't want to take 16...</i>

21
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,189
<i>Here we go.</i>

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,164
<i>- I'm losing it.</i>
<i>- I'm losing the whole record.</i>

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,839
<i>That'd be great.</i>

24
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,943
<i>Something's gonna happen.</i>

25
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,234
<i>All right, here we go. You're
grass and I'm a power mower.</i>

26
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,126
Uh, the brothers here,
Dennis, Brian, and Carl.

27
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:54,800
Carl.

28
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,568
<i>They all live</i>
<i>in the same house and I grew up</i>

29
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,771
<i>a few blocks down.</i>
<i>Al... Al, where did you live?</i>

30
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,042
With a different melody,
It's the same chord progression,

31
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,610
- with a spin-off.
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,313
So, my part in the chorus
against the band

33
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,815
alternates with the intro
backing the new melody.

34
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,246
Gets around. Clever.

35
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,580
Excuse me.

36
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,014
What?

37
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,016
Oh.

38
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,618
Hi, how are you?

39
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,954
I'm fine, thanks.
Are these your shoes?

40
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,722
<i>What? Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>they're my shoes.</i>

41
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,591
<i>I didn't wanna, you know,</i>
<i>mess up the car</i>

42
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:33,925
<i>because I jog.</i>

43
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,661
See, I jog on the beach
and, um...

44
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,997
I get sand in my shoes,
you know?

45
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,032
- Ah.
- So...

46
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,034
Well, that's very considerate.

47
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,803
But I... you know, I also
get sand in my socks,

48
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,806
I got holes in my socks,
so I did make a mess anyways.

49
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,508
<i>So, I'm sorry about that.</i>

50
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,176
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

51
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,412
You didn't get sand in the car.

52
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,714
It's no problem.

53
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,115
Can I help you today?

54
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,785
I'd like to buy a car.

55
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,153
<i>Cadillac, you know?</i>

56
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,188
Great.

57
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,391
- You've come to the right place.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

58
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,562
This is the Fleetwood.

59
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,433
- Wow.
- My personal favorite.

60
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,607
What do you think?

61
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,875
<i>I don't know.</i>

62
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,626
Well, take your time,
there's no pressure.

63
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,217
Blue is a very calm color.

64
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,796
Is this guy a friend of yours?
I feel like he's watching us.

65
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,232
<i>No, he's not my friend.</i>

66
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,503
He's my bodyguard.

67
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,138
Come on.

68
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,041
Something like that.

69
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:59,044
It's a funny word,
isn't it, bodyguard?

70
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,846
- <i> Uh...</i>
- Bodyguard.

71
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,650
- Are we on "Candid Camera"?
- <i> No.</i>

72
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,120
No, no, no. I do need a car.

73
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,953
Can we just sit in here
for a minute?

74
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,497
Sure.

75
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,075
Well, the master lock
feature works.

76
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,776
We know that much.

77
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,211
<i>Hmm.</i>

78
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,122
My brother died.

79
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,159
Oh. Oh, I'm...

80
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,862
I'm so sorry.

81
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,868
He drowned.

82
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,904
A few years ago.

83
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,539
Two.

84
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,810
<i>But I'm all... broken up
about it still, you know?</i>

85
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,113
<i>I mean, he wasn't even 40 yet.</i>

86
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,917
That is... that's terrible.

87
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,753
- So sad.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

88
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,321
<i>But I just don't get it.</i>

89
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,591
I think about it every day,
and I just don't get it.

90
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,326
I guess it's better just not
to think about it, right?

91
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,994
Just...

92
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,030
force it out of your mind.

93
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,300
Sure.
Yeah, I can understand that.

94
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,909
I'm not married anymore.

95
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,016
Okay.

96
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,322
Do you have a pen I could use?

97
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,901
I guess I need
a little piece of paper, too.

98
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,869
Uh, sure. Just, um...

99
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,237
Thank you.

100
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,198
Brian, come on out of the car.

101
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,317
- I'm Brian.
- Melinda.

102
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,852
- Hi.
- Hi.

103
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,354
<i>Come on, Brian.</i>
- I want this car.

104
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,922
- - The Fleetwood?

105
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,091
No, no, yeah, but I want<i> this</i> car.
Okay?

106
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,026
Uh...

107
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,829
I want this car.
This one we're sitting in.

108
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,399
- Oh, the floor model?
- Yes, it's your favorite, right?

109
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,669
- <i> You want...</i>
- It's special. You understand?

110
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,638
- Can I have it?
- Sure.

111
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
- <i> Okay.</i>
- Yes.

112
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,378
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

113
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,079
- What's happening, guys?
<i>- Hi, Gene.</i>

114
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,849
- Hi, I'm Dr. Eugene Landy.
<i>- Hi.</i>

115
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,884
How are you?

116
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,754
I'm Brian's brother
from another mother.

117
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,822
- What's up?
- I want the blue Fleetwood, Gene.

118
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,157
- Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,427
You sure you don't want
a Maserati?

120
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,763
- No offense.
- None taken.

121
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,965
- No, that one.
<i>- Really?</i>

122
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,067
<i>- It's her favorite.</i>
- -<i> Okay.</i>

123
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,804
Well, I'm going to expect
a deal here. You know?

124
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,172
Something worth our while.

125
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,694
Do you know who this man is?
Brian Wilson.

126
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,246
<i>Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.</i>

127
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:25,050
- Ah.

128
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:28,153
- You didn't mention that.
- Well, 'cause that stuff doesn't matter.

129
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,921
That's ego stuff. You know?

130
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,790
Are you kidding me?

131
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,425
I love your music.
I grew up on it.

132
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,260
So, thank you.

133
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,395
That makes me feel really
good, Melinda Ledbetter.

134
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,131
Okay.

135
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,767
- Melinda Ledbetter.
- Right? It's a nice name.

136
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,070
Uh, why don't you get
started on the paperwork?

137
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,338
- Okay?
- Will do.

138
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,974
Great. And thank you
again for your help.

139
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,276
Let's go, Brian.

140
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,312
Come on, guy.

141
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,814
I think it's a good choice.

142
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,048
- You feel good about it?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,383
- You sure?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:58,885
<i>Okay.</i>

145
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,835
What the hell was that about?

146
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,427
I'm not really sure.

147
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,797
You okay?

148
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,868
Yeah.

149
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,069
Yeah.

150
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,259
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're
about to start our descent.</i>

151
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,361
<i>Please return your seats</i>
<i>to an upright position</i>

152
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,163
<i>and fasten your seat belts.</i>

153
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,477
You okay?

154
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,467
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

155
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,166
Brian! Brian!

156
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,036
- Brian! Brian! Brian!
- Get him something!

157
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,504
- Bring us a pillow!
- Breathe!

158
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,972
- Give me the pillow!
- Where's the pillow?!

159
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,941
- Give me the pillow!

160
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,075
- Brian! Brian!
- Breathe!

161
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,077
Are you choking?
Are you choking?

162
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,512
- I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
- Hey!

163
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,947
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I don't wanna die!

164
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,349
Brian, look at me.
Look at me! Look at me!

165
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,385
Look at me!
Look at me. Look at me.

166
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,086
It's okay.

167
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,857
Hi.

168
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,458
You good?

169
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,198
<i>It was weird.</i>

170
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,532
<i>It was like I was in</i>
<i>a movie or something.</i>

171
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,001
<i>There was music, like always,</i>

172
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,370
<i>but then it got dark and scary.</i>

173
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,539
<i>I couldn't breathe.</i>

174
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,975
<i>Like someone was holding</i>
<i>his hand over my mouth.</i>

175
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,411
Hey, Brian.
You doing okay, baby?

176
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,613
Yeah, I'm good, Mare.

177
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,082
Okay, just checking.

178
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,519
Yeah, then I started
hearing things.

179
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,387
Strange things.

180
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,157
- People talking.
- What, like voices?

181
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,426
Like, uh...

182
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,361
like voices in your head?

183
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,896
No!

184
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,068
Well, kind of. Yeah.

185
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,937
Maybe I'm cuckoo
for Cocoa Puffs!

186
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,339
<i>Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!</i>

187
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,107
<i>It was kinda scary.</i>

188
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,377
I think it's just Dad. You know?
Messing with your head.

189
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,646
We're too big for him to
take the belt to us anymore,

190
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,949
so he's gotta use his black
magic shit or something.

191
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,384
<i>- Ah, come on.</i>
<i>- It's not Dad.</i>

192
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,219
<i>- Yeah...</i>
- Something's off.

193
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,321
It's being on the road.

194
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,223
You know, being up there.
It's freaky.

195
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,125
I get nervous
onstage, too, Bri.

196
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,494
- I mean, we all probably do.
- <i> No, but this is different.</i>

197
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,430
Anyway, you don't need me
standing up there

198
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,599
looking like a jerk.

199
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,002
I'll be better
back here at home.

200
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,603
Making music.

201
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,906
I just wanna be home.

202
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,241
I got all kinds of new ideas,

203
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,976
new sounds,

204
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,544
new harmonies,

205
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,980
new instruments.

206
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,282
You hear the new Beatles?

207
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,450
- Yeah.
- The "Rubber Soul"? Yeah.

208
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,253
I heard it was about
John Lennon having an affair.

209
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,621
It's amazing!

210
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,490
I mean, it works like a whole.

211
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,959
It's like a whole album.

212
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,928
Everything fits together,
no fat.

213
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,697
Like an album of folk songs, but
the sounds are really far out.

214
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,066
- Lots of overdubbing.
- They stole our backing vocal.

215
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,504
<i>And then they change it to,</i>

216
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,576
I thought it said, "Tit,
tit, tit, tits, titties."

217
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,178
- No?
- Denny.

218
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,213
We can't let them
get ahead of us!

219
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,381
J...

220
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,283
I can take us further.

221
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,720
<i>If you let me</i>
<i>stay at home in the studio.</i>

222
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,323
It's what I need to do.

223
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,425
And I promise,
when you come back,

224
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:04,262
I will have stuff for you
that will blow your minds.

225
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,068
<i>Bri!</i> - Fine, but you just
keep your head on straight.

226
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,703
- <i> Okay, Bri?</i>
- I will!

227
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,304
<i>- Hey, Brian!</i>
- I will.

228
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,606
- Straight as a die.

229
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,408
Hey, straight as a what?

230
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,609
What does that even mean?

231
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,144
You're gonna die
in a straight line?

232
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,579
I have no idea.
I heard Dad use it once.

233
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,482
Oh, never use it again.

234
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,385
It's gonna be strange to be in
Japan without you, brother.

235
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,254
Yeah, who's gonna
fold our clothes now?

236
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,390
Bri!

237
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,559
Carl, Dennis, come on,
guys, come sit with us.

238
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,228
Okay, I'll be right over.

239
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,168
- <i>- Everybody in!</i>

240
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,208
One of these days,
you are gonna

241
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,211
break your skull open if
you're not careful, Bri.

242
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,646
I'm going to make the greatest
album ever made, Mare!

243
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,648
I know you are, baby.

244
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,484
I know you are.

245
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,153
Ben, two more minutes,
I'm almost ready.

246
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,435
You can lock up.

247
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,064
- This is Melinda.
<i>...Friday night.</i>

248
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,666
<i>6:00?</i>
- Hello?

249
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,604
<i>What? Wrong ear. Put
it on</i> the other ear.

250
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,307
<i>- Hello? Uh, hi.</i>
<i>- Jesus.</i>

251
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,643
<i>Is this Mel... Melinda?</i>

252
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,512
Yes, this is Melinda.

253
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,813
<i>Melinda Ledbetter?</i>

254
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,315
Yes.

255
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,251
<i>Hi.</i>

256
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,553
<i>It's Brian Wilson</i>
<i>from the Beach Boys.</i>

257
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,791
Hi, Brian Wilson
from the Beach Boys.

258
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,262
<i>Melinda!</i>

259
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,265
<i>Melinda Ledbetter!</i>

260
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,436
<i>Melinda Ledbetter!</i>

261
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,240
Melinda!

262
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,844
Are you there?!

263
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,414
Hi.

264
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,649
Hi.

265
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,553
- Hi.
- Hi.

266
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,857
- How are you?
- I'm great!

267
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,726
- You look really great.
- Thank you.

268
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,732
- You wanna go?
- Oh, did you... yeah.

269
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,134
I...

270
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,638
- I forgot your apartment number.
- Ah. Well...

271
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,273
It's a good thing
the loudspeaker worked.

272
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,675
Yeah.

273
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,847
Why does it feel like
the prom all of a sudden?

274
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,515
I'm not sure.

275
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,385
Thank you.

276
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,588
- Hey, Melinda.
- Hi.

277
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,257
- You look great.
- Uh, hi!

278
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,742
I love it.

279
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,544
Such a beautiful song.

280
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,479
- What's that?
- Excuse me?

281
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,614
I couldn't hear what you said.

282
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,482
What'd you say to Brian?

283
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,684
Uh, I... I just said
that this song is...

284
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,253
is so great. I love it.

285
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,188
- Why? Why?
- No, it's a great song.

286
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,725
It's fantastic. You're right.
Timeless.

287
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,179
Well...

288
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,749
I guess this is good night.

289
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,289
Good night.

290
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,012
- Okay.
- Would you like me to call you again?

291
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,299
Would you like
to call me again?

292
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,502
Or... are you just asking
'cause you were told to?

293
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,906
Both things.

294
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,545
- Both.
- I really appreciate your honesty.

295
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,582
I really do. I don't meet a
lot of honest people anymore.

296
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,222
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
be home most of the day Sunday.

297
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,290
Give me a call
if you feel like it.

298
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,925
If you don't, that's fine, too.
There's no pressure.

299
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,427
I'm gonna call you.

300
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,797
- Cool.
- Cool.

301
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,504
Good night.

302
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,908
<i>Good night.</i>

303
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,108
And the last verse
repeats one more time

304
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,311
and the chorus will harmonize
over and over at the end.

305
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,614
It's still rough, I know,
but it's getting there.

306
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,750
It's right for Carl's voice.

307
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,685
You like it, Dad?

308
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,887
<i>I mean, it'll get better.</i>
<i>The vocals will...</i>

309
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,457
<i>counterpoint the backing track.</i>

310
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,825
<i>Real soulful.</i>

311
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,397
Oh, you don't want
my advice or my meddling.

312
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,867
Well, just tell me
what you think.

313
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,470
Not much use for me, is there?

314
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,038
With your mom
living on her own.

315
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,640
Come on, we're still a family.

316
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,645
Families don't fire
their own father.

317
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,881
<i>I don't want to start</i>
<i>that argument again.</i>

318
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,684
- I'm not arguing.
- If I say something now, you'll argue.

319
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,519
Then don't say anything.

320
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,021
Forget it!

321
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,724
<i>Forget what? Forget what?!</i>

322
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,160
- You don't like the song.
- <i> I never said that.</i>

323
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:18,796
- I can tell.

324
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,066
<i>Just say something!</i>

325
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,168
I would change the title.

326
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,405
The Capris had a tune out
called "God Only Knows"

327
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,808
- in '55, '54.
- Never mind that.

328
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,910
Did you close your eyes
like I asked you to?

329
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,045
Tony and I think...

330
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,149
if you close your eyes,
you can see a place

331
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:40,918
where something's happening.

332
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,554
It's like being blind, but because
you're blind, you can see more.

333
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,656
Don't you think it's a
spiritual kind of thing?

334
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,959
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

335
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,829
I closed my eyes,
didn't see a thing.

336
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,634
I don't know,
maybe it could be something

337
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,436
with the right arrangement.

338
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,037
Well, yeah,
I have French horns on it

339
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,807
and flutes, tambourines,
sleigh bells, piano, bass,

340
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,708
real complex key shifts.

341
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,546
Frankly, if you
really want to know,

342
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,481
I don't care for it.

343
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,016
It's too wishy-washy.

344
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,685
If you leave me, why leave me?

345
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,688
Life will go on,
why go on living?

346
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,457
It's not like
a Beach Boys song.

347
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,125
Your brothers
are gonna hate it.

348
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,695
- It's a love song.
- It's a suicide note.

349
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,997
Didn't you just say it could be
something with the right arrangement?!

350
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,634
Well, I gave it
another thought, okay?

351
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,570
And if you can't keep
your voice down in my house,

352
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:33,804
get out!

353
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:54,992
Hey, Carol.

354
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,161
- How's it going?
- Good. Good to see you.

355
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,729
Groovy shades.

356
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,264
Lyle, how's it going?

357
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,202
- Hal, hey. Good to see you.
- Hey. You, too.

358
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,670
I want you to meet Tony Asher.

359
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,972
Tony Asher, this is Hal Blaine.

360
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,274
The greatest drummer
working today.

361
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,709
And you never heard
of him, have you?

362
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,577
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

363
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,080
That's the secret. All these
guys, Hal, Tommy, Carol, Earl,

364
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,182
the whole band.
I mean, they're probably

365
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,185
the best in the business,
but they're studio musicians,

366
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,621
so nobody's ever heard of them.
It's crazy!

367
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,122
- Huh?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

368
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,405
Yeah. Here you go.

369
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,961
Kettle drums? Thought we
were doing rock 'n' roll.

370
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,132
Ah, a whole new bag.

371
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,201
So what do we got
going here, Brian?

372
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,538
Uh, I don't know, Hal.
Just some ideas.

373
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,306
- Try something.

374
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,041
Oh, excuse me.

375
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,748
- Bum, bum, bum.
- Yup.

376
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,030
Yeah, let's try it.

377
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,286
Mmm.

378
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,160
<i>That's exactly</i> how I want it.

379
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,896
You know what I'm gonna do?

380
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,231
Let's add a little
tie right here.

381
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,999
I think this'll sound better,

382
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:12,202
- a little smoother right there.
- You wanna tie the first one?

383
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,939
Okay, this is "I'm Waiting
For the Day," take six.

384
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:18,742
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>One, two, one, two, three.</i>

385
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,235
Oh, hey! That was outta sight.

386
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,838
I mean, it really was, Al.
How did you play that?

387
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,274
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- What?!

388
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,813
- <i> How did you play that?</i>

389
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:58,282
- It was a mistake.
- <i> Well, if you repeat a mistake</i>

390
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,351
every four bars,
it's not a mistake anymore.

391
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,386
- See what I mean?
- <i> I love it.</i>

392
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,790
<i>- That was great.</i>
<i>- Okay, let's do it again.</i>

393
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,093
Remember, it's the uh... uh... higher
octave on the upbeats and the bridge.

394
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,329
<i>Hey, Brian?</i>

395
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,297
- Yeah, I love that.
- Brian?

396
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,433
- Yeah?
- I think you might've screwed up here.

397
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,968
Really? Let me see.

398
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,137
Well, you've got
Lyle playing in D

399
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,939
- and the rest of us are in A major.
- Yeah, that's right.

400
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,176
How does that work? Two baselines
in two different keys?

401
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,311
Well, it works in my head.

402
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,713
It's all playing in my head.

403
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,815
The orchestration
and the five vocal parts.

404
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,218
<i>I think it's gonna work.</i>
<i>Let's try it.</i>

405
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,721
- - Oh, Hal? Hal?

406
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,163
Here's how I want you
to do it. It goes, uh...

407
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,234
the first beat on the
last bar of the intro.

408
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,303
Boom! Two, three, four.

409
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,772
- <i> Bah doom!</i>

410
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,751
There's the North Star
right there.

411
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:43,487
- That's the North Star?
- Yeah, yeah. You knew that.

412
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,957
- I really didn't.
- Come on.

413
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,926
- I mean, it's a bright star.
- Have you ever...

414
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,260
have you ever seen this before?

415
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,995
- Never like this.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

416
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,799
<i>I used to love</i>
<i>coming here as a kid, you know?</i>

417
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,102
<i>I love the feel of this place.</i>

418
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,003
<i>I really wanted</i>
<i>to take you here.</i>

419
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,839
<i>- You did?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

420
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,050
Demonstration booths.
Do you remember those?

421
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:16,120
- In the department store?
- Yeah, and that's when I first heard.

422
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:18,021
The Four Freshmen

423
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,457
and immediately my mind just...

424
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,427
- I mean, it's...
- Like magic.

425
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,229
Something happened and...

426
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,431
so I listened to those
harmonies and study them

427
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,201
after school, and I would
teach them to my brothers.

428
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,003
And we'd all sing.

429
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,538
And then I would
teach them to my parents

430
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,073
and we'd all be
sitting around singing.

431
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,542
My brothers and my parents
and everybody.

432
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,477
- Everybody.
<i>- Wow.</i>

433
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,180
<i>That sounds like</i>
<i>such a wonderful childhood.</i>

434
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,782
<i>Yeah, it was really nice,</i>

435
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,884
<i>except for when my dad</i>
<i>was beating on us</i>

436
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:49,052
<i>- all the time, you know?</i>
- <i> Like...</i>

437
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:53,023
He was a really hard, hard guy.

438
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,825
You know, like, um...

439
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,530
There's a spanking.
You know that sound?

440
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,398
You know a certain
kind of spanking,

441
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,360
and it sounds like a...
you know, like...

442
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,104
<i>But the way we had it,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

443
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,573
When it came out of him, it's...

444
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:13,210
You know?

445
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,845
<i>Really hard.</i>

446
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,181
Come on, let's give
these guys some privacy.

447
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,949
- You know, we laugh about it.
- Babe, I can't just...

448
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,818
<i>- Doug, come on.</i>
- You know, back in those days?

449
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,053
We laugh about all that, but...

450
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,056
<i>it was pretty tough business.</i>

451
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,358
<i>Pretty tough business.</i>

452
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,095
Hey.

453
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,932
- I'm so sorry.
- No, what? About what?

454
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,267
They're okay,
they come here all the time.

455
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,504
- It's their favorite spot.
<i>No, Brian,</i> about your dad.

456
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,406
Oh, yeah.

457
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,342
You know, spare...
spare the rod,

458
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,044
spoil the child.

459
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,480
- <i> You know I'm 96% deaf</i>

460
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:53,584
<i>in my right ear because</i>
<i>my dad whacked me all the time?</i>

461
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,587
He was a really hard man

462
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,922
and he was
a not very happy man,

463
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,991
but, uh...

464
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,260
in some ways I love my dad,
you know, because...

465
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,128
he scared me
and he scared me so much,

466
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,497
I think he actually scared me
into making good records.

467
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,233
- <i> Hmm.</i>
- You know? I mean, he had this, like,

468
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,569
<i>competitive spirit</i>
<i>that really blew my mind and...</i>

469
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,404
What about your mom?

470
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,642
She stayed out
of all of it, mostly.

471
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,912
I think she drank a lot.
You know?

472
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,214
That's how she...
she... she dealt with it.

473
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:30,587
I haven't seen her in...
three years?

474
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,123
- What?
- Yeah, Gene doesn't think it's a good idea

475
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,525
for me to be in touch
with my family right now.

476
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,962
I haven't seen
my daughters in...

477
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,464
two years.

478
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,636
You have two daughters.

479
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:48,906
Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,210
I wasn't a very good father
to them, you know?

481
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,680
Because I was drinking and drugging
when I should have been...

482
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,548
you know, a parent.

483
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,285
And, uh...

484
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,387
you know, I made a
mess of my life,

485
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,656
lost control of my life.

486
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,524
It's a weird trip,

487
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,559
but...

488
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,762
anyway, they live in
Encino with their mom.

489
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,634
Well, shit.

490
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,269
Yeah.

491
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,473
But it's not
so bad now anymore.

492
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,108
You know?

493
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,344
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

494
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:33,885
Good.

495
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,687
Look, listen to me, I'm
just going on and on.

496
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:38,555
- It's my boring life...
- <i> It's not boring.</i>

497
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,390
It is,
but what about you, Melinda?

498
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,460
- I mean, my God, you're so...

499
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,297
You're such good fun
and you're... you're so...

500
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,599
so tender and so sweet.

501
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,701
I mean...

502
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,604
why don't you have
a... boyfriend?

503
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,377
Oh, well...

504
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,714
There was someone.

505
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:09,052
He was no good.
He broke my heart.

506
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,257
He shouldn't have done that.

507
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,659
Well, I shouldn't have let him.

508
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,469
<i>Aww, sh...</i>

509
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,371
Fuck. Tony, you holding
those keys down?

510
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,739
- Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

511
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,074
Can I have another
bobby pin, please, Hal?

512
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,379
Okay, keep the keys down, Tony.

513
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,513
Here we go.

514
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,104
<i>Yeah, so, uh, right here.</i>

515
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,440
No, give it, uh...

516
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,142
- like...

517
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,024
There's like a gasp in between.

518
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,385
- Cut! I think we got it.

519
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,255
Chuck, mix that in, uh,
with the sound of the

520
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,689
<i>train going by at the end</i>
<i>of "Caroline, No."</i>

521
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,658
- You got it, Brian.
- <i> Hey, Chuck,</i>

522
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,394
you think we could
get a horse in here?

523
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,748
Hey, kid.

524
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,285
<i>Brian.</i>

525
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,221
Brian!

526
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,623
Brian! You got a light?

527
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,292
- I spilled coffee on my matches in there.
- Yeah.

528
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,275
Tough day at the office?

529
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,644
Well...

530
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,213
my family's coming in tomorrow,

531
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,916
the band, they're...

532
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:55,998
well, sometimes they're
tough, you know?

533
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,691
Let me tell you something.

534
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,670
We're all pros, you know?

535
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,706
We've played with everyone.

536
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,542
Heard it all.

537
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,944
You name 'em, we've
played with 'em.

538
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:24,281
Sinatra, Dean Martin,

539
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,350
Elvis, Phil Spector,

540
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,288
Sam Cooke, everyone!

541
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,850
And we all studied in goddamn
conservatories, for Christ's sake.

542
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,297
But...

543
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,933
but you...

544
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:46,469
you gotta know

545
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,391
that you're touched, kid.

546
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,602
You've blown our minds.

547
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,455
- More than Phil Spector?
- Ah, Phil's got nothing on you.

548
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,654
Oh, man.

549
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,390
No, the band's gonna love it.

550
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,858
Every note of it.

551
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,964
You're a talented young man.

552
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,802
Hang in there, man.
I'll see ya.

553
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,445
- I'll see ya tomorrow, Hal.
-

554
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,923
<i>Wow, nice place. Yeah, come on in.
</i> Let me show you around.

555
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,631
- Oh, wow.
- This is my room.

556
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:48,932
This is my room.

557
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,571
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah, I got to pick it.

558
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,706
What do you mean?

559
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,308
Well, you know,
I got another house

560
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,877
a little bit
up the coast, you know?

561
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,812
- You do?
- But Gene wants me to live, you know,

562
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,714
in a more
controlled environment.

563
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,916
So he's living in that
one and I'm living here.

564
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,552
You know, not so many
distractions and memories.

565
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,454
But I got to pick the room.

566
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,617
- Wow.
- Ch... ch... check this out.

567
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,893
Look at this.

568
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,034
That's absolutely beautiful.

569
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,703
Thanks.

570
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,471
What is it?

571
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,839
Oh, that's just
something that I

572
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,281
came up with when I saw you.

573
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,845
What are you gonna do with it?

574
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,081
Nothing, it's gone.

575
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,443
That was just for you.

576
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,522
That's so incredible.
Oh, my God,

577
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,558
that just, like,
came out of you.

578
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,727
Is that how it works?
Or just...

579
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,695
Yeah. Sometimes.

580
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,634
Sometimes your inner voice
wants to express itself

581
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,603
and every once in a while,
every blue moon,

582
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:36,005
your soul... comes out to play.

583
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,574
- You know?
- Wow.

584
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,576
Can't be rushed.

585
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,578
It's like a kid,
it's just nature,

586
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,813
but... yeah.

587
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,154
Can I ask you
something personal?

588
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,958
- Personal?
- Kind of.

589
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,040
Sure, I'm an open book.

590
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,065
Did you really spend
two years in bed?

591
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,468
No...

592
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,936
more like three.

593
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,787
At least, that's what
I tell people.

594
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,714
I got out at night
sometimes in my bathrobe.

595
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,020
Do you like matzo ball soup?

596
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,891
I don't know. I don't think...

597
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:31,094
- I've ever had matzo ball soup.
- No?

598
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,029
It's really good.

599
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,467
My ex-wife was Jewish,
did I tell you that?

600
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,169
- No.
- That's when I first had it.

601
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:40,937
- Oh.
- At Marilyn's parents' house.

602
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,059
They're really nice parents.

603
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,476
She saved my life.

604
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,545
- Marilyn?
- Mmm.

605
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,846
Mare.

606
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,148
I wasn't a very good
husband, I told you,

607
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,184
but...

608
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:56,486
we were only kids
when we got married.

609
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,556
- She was 16. 16.
- That's crazy.

610
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,661
I think it's an acquired
taste, you know?

611
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,931
- Marriage?
- Matzo ball soup.

612
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,101
We should go one day, you know?

613
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,770
- Go to Canter's and try it.
- Sure.

614
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,972
- Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah, I would. Why not?

615
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,241
- I don't wanna force you to.
- You wouldn't be.

616
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,900
I mean, it's not gonna
kill you or anything.

617
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:20,710
I would hope not.

618
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,846
You know, I mean,
just have a little bit.

619
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:23,980
- It's good to try new things in life.
- Okay. I will.

620
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,882
I will try to keep
an open mind.

621
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,984
- It's important to try things.
- Good.

622
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,253
- New things.
- New things.

623
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:33,490
- I agree.

624
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,991
Brian,

625
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,659
time for your pills.

626
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,995
<i>Come on.</i>

627
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,003
- One minute.
- Oh.

628
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,174
- <i>- Melinda,</i>

629
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,610
you ever hear of the, um...

630
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,079
"Underground Dictionary"?
Thank you, sweetheart.

631
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,781
- Uh, no.
- Well, I published it.

632
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,251
- <i> 1971.</i>
- Huh.

633
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,019
<i>It's an amazing book.</i>
<i>It's a, uh...</i>

634
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,921
<i>lexicon for subcultural speak.</i>

635
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,725
It's a reference book
for professionals

636
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:11,261
of all kinds to learn
how to talk to...

637
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,964
the subcultures of the time.

638
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,801
- <i> Bikers, hookers,</i> surfers...
- Hey.

639
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,537
- Are you okay?
- <i> ...junkies, blacks...</i>

640
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,907
- Yeah.
- What does he have you on?

641
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:27,243
I get allergies. I get
allergies, so, um...

642
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:27,979
I get a little drowsy.

643
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:30,079
<i>And believe me, they're
</i> the toughest ones to talk to.

644
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,915
Right, Brian?

645
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,052
I'm... I'm... I'm hungry, Gene.

646
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,589
<i>It was a real</i> bitchin' concept book.
- Gene, I'm hungry.

647
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:41,792
Kind of ahead of its time
and it got a lot of attention.

648
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,226
- Frankly.
<i>- Gene, I'm hungry.</i>

649
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,928
It's coming.

650
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,064
<i>Uh, far out, right on,</i>
<i>out of sight,</i>

651
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,199
<i>uh, smokey tits, bonnaroo.</i>

652
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,771
Uh, super wicked, wiggy.

653
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,941
How about that? All right.

654
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,976
We got one ready here.

655
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:03,146
Mmm. Guest of honor first.

656
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:04,314
- Oh.
- There you go, ma'am.

657
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:07,116
- Nope.
- You know, I'm...

658
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,319
- You... you should have it.
- No, no, you know what? He's not as hungry

659
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,254
- as he thinks he is.
- I'm... I'm hungry.

660
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,056
Ah-ah-ah. No, you're not.
You know what?

661
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:15,224
You need to drink more water
and you would be full.

662
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,994
- I think he's hungry.
- Go ahead. No, patience is a virtue.

663
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,929
- Seriously, he can wait.
- I think he should...

664
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,864
- I can share.
- Taste it.

665
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,975
- Good? Far out.
- Mmm.

666
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,377
Far out.

667
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,048
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah?

668
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,618
Exactly what allergies
does he suffer from anyway?

669
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,700
Don't you worry about that.

670
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,291
Brian's medications are very
carefully administered,

671
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,927
if you must know.

672
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,130
You know what? No, God damn it!
Jesus Christ!

673
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,399
Seriously?! Seriously?!

674
00:43:56,401 --> 00:44:00,236
You have got to learn
to wait your goddamn turn!

675
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:03,006
Jesus Christ!

676
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:05,041
Now this is what happens, okay?

677
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,976
I'm hungry. No!

678
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,046
You are not goddamn hungry!
You<i> think</i> you're hungry!

679
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:13,016
Do you you understand
the goddamn difference?!

680
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,284
Wait your turn!

681
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:17,646
You have got to be kidding me!

682
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,992
You have no idea the
consequences from this.

683
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,894
- Okay?
- No.

684
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:28,264
No idea, man! Come on!

685
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,400
Jesus Christ! Rob?

686
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:51,287
<i>First of all, I want to apologize
about the other night.</i>

687
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:55,091
<i>I can get worked up sometimes
when it comes to Brian.</i>

688
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,360
<i>Now, I should have</i>
<i>met with you earlier,</i>

689
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,063
but with all of that said,

690
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,031
I really don't want
you to be alarmed

691
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:05,268
by what, uh, I'm gonna
talk to you about now.

692
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,404
But you should know
that you are dealing with

693
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:12,141
a very, very... sick man.

694
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:14,210
<i>There's no other way</i>
<i>to say it. Sorry.</i>

695
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,746
Well, how sick is he?

696
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:19,949
Brian is a...
paranoid schizophrenic.

697
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,820
But you really
do not need to be alarmed

698
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,221
because I have it
under control.

699
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,191
I am the control...
so to speak.

700
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,159
<i>When I started</i>
<i>working with Brian,</i>

701
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:33,062
<i>he weighed, what... 300 pounds?</i>

702
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,364
He spent all day in bed

703
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,334
eating bloody steaks
and a lot of junk food.

704
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:41,003
- Self-medicating.
- <i> Oh.</i>

705
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:43,840
Drinking, among other things.

706
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:47,410
Uh, just not dealing,
not able to look me in the eye.

707
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,379
Not able to look anybody
in the eye.

708
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:52,048
Frankly, suicidal.

709
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,117
- <i> So...</i>
- Really?

710
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,385
<i>I pulled him out of the grave,</i>

711
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,855
and I stood him up,

712
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,858
and I taught him
how to start living again.

713
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:07,029
He was very open,
I mean, he... I...

714
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,198
- Hmm.
- ...thought, you know, he told me

715
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,967
- he was taking
medication for anxiety...

716
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:13,970
- and a little depression.
- First thing, don't...

717
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,972
believe everything
that Brian tells you.

718
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:19,475
He's, uh... he's a little
boy in a man's body.

719
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,410
I mean, there's a lot
of playacting going on

720
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,513
in Brian World.
Are you in love with him?

721
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,984
- Oh...

722
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:31,254
Please understand something.
I hope you do.

723
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,489
It's my job... it's my duty

724
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,859
to approve anyone that
Brian is spending time with.

725
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:38,828
And I mean<i> everyone.</i>

726
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,098
Yeah? So...

727
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,833
<i>If you want to</i>
<i>continue to see him,</i>

728
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:46,235
well, then there's
gonna have to be some rules.

729
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,037
Um, for example,

730
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,540
if Brian calls you,
asks you out for a date,

731
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,175
well, that's fantastic,

732
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,211
but I need you to call me
directly... immediately.

733
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,281
And afterwards,
I think it would be

734
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,049
therapeutically useful

735
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:03,052
if you report to me
everything that happened.

736
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,054
<i>Your thoughts, your feelings.</i>

737
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,123
<i>Uh, his thoughts, his feelings.</i>

738
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,326
<i>And so far as you can report
on those things objectively</i>

739
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,094
<i>from your perspective.</i>
<i>You follow me?</i>

740
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:15,198
- I'm giving you
unprecedented access here.

741
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,068
But... I need you...

742
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,304
to work with me.

743
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,306
All right,
you want a cup of tea?

744
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:25,408
But, you know, your suspicion

745
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,910
is just like Brian's
initial paranoia.

746
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,146
His desire not to get better.

747
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:31,581
But, you know, that came from

748
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,349
no sense of self-worth,

749
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,953
no belief in himself,
no ability to trust.

750
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,488
You have the ability
to trust, Melinda?

751
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,157
Come on.

752
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,160
I'm helping a great man
learn how to be alive again.

753
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:46,128
Why not trust me?

754
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,498
I'm gonna try, Gene.
I just don't know you.

755
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,534
Mm-hmm, but I know you.

756
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,605
As I told you, it is my job.

757
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,141
Okay?

758
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,978
You think of yourself as an
independent woman, right?

759
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,180
Hagerty girl, right?

760
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:06,282
Successful modeling career,

761
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:08,651
some long-term relationships,

762
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,953
disappointments. Hmm?

763
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,356
Your last boyfriend took
you for a bit of a ride.

764
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,359
Had a girl in every port.

765
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,395
And now you...

766
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,230
sell cars.

767
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,599
Well, we all do what we can.

768
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,268
We do.

769
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,036
- And life can be painful.
- Hmm.

770
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,906
I know. That's all I'm saying.

771
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,011
You know, I don't believe
in coincidences.

772
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,913
There's a reason we met.

773
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:41,417
All of us. Let's work together.

774
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,522
Help me out and let me help you

775
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:49,225
and help me help Brian. Okay?

776
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,395
Thanks, Gene. Thank you.

777
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:54,196
Take good care of yourself.

778
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,533
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

779
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:06,569
- Where's my favorite big brother?
- Denny!

780
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,738
- How you doing? Oh, hey.
- Ooh!

781
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,340
Hey, man, forget about
California girls,

782
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,477
- Tokyo is where it's at!
- Tokyo girls? Denny.

783
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:17,013
- I missed you, Bri.
- Oh, it's good to see you.

784
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:18,647
Hey, look,
I got you a souvenir.

785
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,516
Hey, it matches
your shirt. It's cool.

786
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,585
- Hey, Al, good to see you!
- Good to see you.

787
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,254
- Bruce, thanks for being there for me.
- It's an honor, Brian.

788
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,556
No way to fill your shoes,
but I did my best.

789
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,025
- Cousin.
- Mike!

790
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,060
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you!

791
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,162
- What happened? Look at that beard!
- I know, I know,

792
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:35,131
but what happened to you? You're
getting a little tubby here.

793
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,299
What happened? You should
go on a fast with me.

794
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,135
Well, I'm already
eating as fast as I can.

795
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:41,570
Well, fatty, we are ready
to rock to your roll, man.

796
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,606
- Let's... let's listen to some tracks.
- Good to see you.

797
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,441
- <i> All right!</i>
- What you got cooking?

798
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:48,044
You know, Carl, a samurai
sword would have been...

799
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,345
- Well, yeah, but I just...
-

800
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,427
- it was in the airport.
- Does it look cool?

801
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:53,342
Hey, Brian? This chorus.

802
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:56,212
The lyrics.

803
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,581
Don't you think
it's a little, uh...

804
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,749
- What?

805
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,119
"Hang on to your ego,"
what are you trying to say?

806
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,222
Uh...

807
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:07,623
well...

808
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,358
- "hang on to your ego."
- Yeah, ego.

809
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,660
Are you saying...

810
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,629
Is this a druggie song?
Is this a drug song?

811
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,899
- A drug song?
- Yes, "hang on to your ego."

812
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:19,902
Uh, "hang on, but I know that
you're gonna lose the fight."

813
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:23,672
I don't know. I... I don't
think it's a drug song,

814
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:25,674
- <i> whatever that is.</i>
- "They come on like they're peaceful",

815
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,543
but inside they're so uptight.

816
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:31,380
"They trip through the day and waste
all their thoughts at night."

817
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,449
Sounds like a druggie
to me, Brian.

818
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,918
- Druggie?!
- Don't pretend like you don't know

819
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,188
- what I'm talking about here!
- Okay, it's about ego. That's all.

820
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,425
<i>It's about ego?</i>

821
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:46,262
<i>That's all? Okay.</i>

822
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,733
I'm not trying... I'm not trying
to be a tough guy here, okay?

823
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:53,435
I'm just asking a question. I just
wanna know if it's a drug song.

824
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:54,870
If it's not a drug song,
I wanna know what it's about.

825
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,572
Does it sound like a
drug song to anybody else?

826
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,207
Okay, it's not a drug song,
but is it about...

827
00:52:58,209 --> 00:52:59,775
I don't know, it sounds fine.

828
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,744
Okay, okay, so hang on...
we'll hang on to our ego.

829
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:04,586
Let's all just hang on to our
egos and record the song.

830
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,814
<i>You have that attached</i>
<i>to the flash?</i>

831
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:41,584
Brian, your voice
is on the track.

832
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,820
<i>Stop, please.</i>

833
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,589
Yeah!

834
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:47,756
No.

835
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,427
- Yes.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

836
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,530
Hmm?

837
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:56,799
I mean, yeah, I left them in.

838
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,667
I like it.

839
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,369
<i>We're listening here.</i>
- You left them in?

840
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,870
The voices? The talking
and in your head?

841
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:04,373
That's part of the song?

842
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:08,855
It's just like all the
other instruments we use.

843
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:09,770
It's all part of it.

844
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,486
- Play the studio?
- I like it, Bri.

845
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,355
<i>They're not gonna</i>
<i>hear it anyways,</i>

846
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,323
it's buried under there.
I... I think it's really cool.

847
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,859
<i>- Can we stop it, please?</i>
- Jesus, come on, Mike.

848
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,028
<i>- No, no, no, it's amateurish.</i>
<i>- It's amateurish.</i>

849
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,997
It's hip, man! It's fun!

850
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:30,266
It's now! That's where
things are happening.

851
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,634
- Brian, it's not.
- Now!

852
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:33,002
No, this is not fun.

853
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:35,337
- Not the music...
- I think it's fun.

854
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,772
Not the lyrics. Now, it's not
all bad, don't get me wrong,

855
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,341
but it's not Beach Boys fun.

856
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:41,744
- We've done Beach Boys fun.
- And we had hits, we had lots of hits!

857
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:43,779
<i>Why are we</i> arguing right now, Mike?
- There's not one hit

858
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,782
on this album, guys! I don't care how
many car horns and bicycle bells

859
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,717
and jingle-jangle or
whatever you put in there.

860
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,053
They're not gonna buy something
depressing like that!

861
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:53,922
- Depressing?
- Even the happy songs are sad.

862
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:56,358
We need to write some of the
old stuff again, fellas.

863
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,294
- That's all I'm saying.
- The old stuff is old!

864
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,896
- So we'll make it new again!
- I can't go back in time!

865
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,531
We're not surfers,
we never have been,

866
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,800
and real surfers
don't dig our music anyway.

867
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,902
- They don't.
- Okay, I can't write about the summer

868
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:10,072
and fun and summer
and summer and fun and cars!

869
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,374
I got different stuff
inside me,

870
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,709
I gotta get it out.

871
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:15,077
Oh, jeez, would you
listen to yourself?

872
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,546
You've "gotta get it out"?

873
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,682
- Who are you? Mozart?!
<i>- Everyone shut up!</i>

874
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,051
<i>Carl, play it again.</i>

875
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:24,669
It's a new creative bag,
we've gotta keep growing!

876
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:25,412
Oh, jeez.

877
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,592
None of these guys have played one
single note on the entire album.

878
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,362
It's like you're making your own
record with our voices, Brian.

879
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:35,030
Dennis played.

880
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,865
- A little bit. Carl, too.
- "A little bit,"

881
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,827
for crying out loud, would
you listen to yourself?

882
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,937
First you wanted
to stop touring with us,

883
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,572
and we accepted that, that's fine.
Bruce is doing great.

884
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,407
But now it's like
we're barely a part

885
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,076
of the Brian Wilson Band!

886
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:52,845
You can't just do whatever
the hell you want, Brian!

887
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,180
The other guys
might not say this,

888
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,071
but you are letting us down.

889
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,563
If you stop thinking about
yourself for two seconds,

890
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:09,098
you might realize that.

891
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,773
<i>Sorry, sorry, Brian,</i>
<i>but apparently your dad</i>

892
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,608
<i>just drove up.</i>
<i>I thought you'd want to know.</i>

893
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,944
- Shit!
- Hide the pot!

894
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,581
Fuck!

895
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,692
<i>- Uncle Murray!</i>
<i>- Boys?</i>

896
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,761
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.</i>
- Mike, Al.

897
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:48,597
Good to see you, boys.

898
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,998
Dad, good to see you, sir.

899
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,567
Where's Brian?

900
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,001
<i>There you are. How you doing?</i>

901
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,870
Good, good.

902
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:57,940
<i>- Listen to this.</i>
<i>- Chuck, if you would be so kind.</i>

903
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,041
<i>My new band.</i>

904
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,985
- - This is where you guys
need to get back to.

905
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,653
This is a hit.

906
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,482
Check out the harmonies.

907
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,731
I'm telling you,
I am taking these guys

908
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,894
all the way to the top!

909
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,104
That's great, Dad.
You're doing your own thing.

910
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,775
- For the next take.
<i>- Sure, Brian.</i>

911
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:36,879
Brian, come back here. Listen to
what a gold record sounds like.

912
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,844
<i>Doesn't this guy sound</i>
<i>just like Brian?</i>

913
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,781
<i>I don't give a shit, Brian!</i>

914
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,053
<i>I don't give a shit!</i>

915
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,237
- - I just wanna say, man.
Listen man, you're the artist.

916
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,140
Right? You want God.
You should have God.

917
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:14,076
Don't you wanna be out
there rocking the boat?

918
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:17,713
- Mmm.
- What is this? 1939? Mike says?

919
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:19,381
Who cares what Mike says?

920
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,817
Sing what's in your soul, man.

921
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,186
Let the world
stand on its head.

922
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,988
Don't listen to the
record company suits.

923
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,756
Don't listen to anybody.

924
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,358
Listen to you.

925
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,627
You're the genius.

926
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,996
We're the band as far as anybody
in the know is concerned.

927
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:35,864
- Right?!
- Sorry, man. It's true.

928
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:37,933
Listen, Brian, I got
something for you, man.

929
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,635
Something for you, man.

930
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,838
It'll take all that crap
outta your head, man.

931
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,978
Where were you?

932
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,920
I did LSD.

933
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,158
Really?

934
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,128
Really?

935
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,932
What was it like?

936
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:19,101
Well...

937
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:22,070
at first it was nothing,

938
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,073
then everything.

939
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,144
And then I did it again.

940
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,748
- Again?

941
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,783
Oh, I heard the most...

942
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:39,521
a whole other kind of music.

943
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:42,357
I saw things...

944
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,392
that you can't see.

945
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,363
Like what?

946
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,534
What things that you can't see?

947
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:55,103
Like...

948
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,505
weird things?

949
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,409
Things like God.

950
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,282
- What?
- I saw God and...

951
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,785
he showed me everything.

952
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,555
Oh, he showed me
the future, Mare.

953
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,058
Oh, I'm so sorry.

954
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,829
Brian?

955
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,432
- I'm so sorry.
- Brian, what are you talking about?

956
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:27,135
- Bri?

957
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,871
What is the matter? Hey...

958
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:32,474
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

959
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,243
No, hey, hey...

960
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:38,446
- It's okay. It's okay, Bri.

961
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,768
Here, come here. Come here.

962
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,893
Hey, Evan!

963
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:02,464
What? It's a tribute
to you, Brian!

964
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:04,199
We're stoked to have you, man.

965
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,401
Okay. Could you
turn it off anyway,

966
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,603
because it sort of
destroys my brain.

967
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,274
It does.

968
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:14,576
I can only imagine.

969
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,679
- Are you having fun?
- I'm having so much fun.

970
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,481
I love being with you.

971
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:23,118
And not with Gene and the
whole gang watching us.

972
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,153
Oh, uh, Gene told me
to tell you

973
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,555
that he was sorry about the
other day with the barbecue.

974
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:30,358
That Doug gave me the
wrong dosage and, um...

975
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,160
so that's why
he lost his temper

976
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:34,229
and that... he's really sorry,

977
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,331
but he wanted us
to have a good time.

978
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:36,906
Ah.

979
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:39,200
And that's why it was
good that Evan was here.

980
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:41,937
- So, you know?
- Yeah, how do you know Evan?

981
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:44,673
- Evan's Gene's son.
- Ah.

982
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:48,977
Ah, so we're
still being watched.

983
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,417
Yeah.

984
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,290
But we can do whatever we want.

985
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,772
I think we should do
whatever we want, too.

986
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,395
What do you wanna do?

987
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:09,197
Evan, will you take that...

988
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,499
- Can you swim?
- Yes.

989
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,236
Evan, will you take the boat
in really close to shore?

990
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:17,439
I wanna show Melinda my house.

991
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,174
Go in past the kelp.

992
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:22,656
Sure thing! Whatever
makes you happy, Brian.

993
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,582
All right, on the count of
three, I want you to get up,

994
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:30,424
I want you to jump in the water and I
want you to come over to my house.

995
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,322
- Right now. You ready? Come on.
- What?! Are you serious?

996
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,359
Yeah, let's do it. Let's ditch this
scene and make out like teenagers.

997
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,428
In or out? Come on.

998
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,597
- In.
- One, two, three!

999
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,190
That is not cool, Brian! My
dad's gonna go nuts on me!

1000
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,694
Whoo!

1001
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,263
Cold? You cold?

1002
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:18,033
I'm exhausted. That was crazy!

1003
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:22,670
- Come on, come on, come on.

1004
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:02,544
- You wanna hear something funny?
- Of course.

1005
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,380
Gene's got me on this thing,

1006
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,782
I have to say to myself
five times a day,

1007
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,384
"I love you."

1008
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,855
It's called self-nourishment.

1009
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,759
- Can you believe that?

1010
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,462
- Does it work?
- I don't know.

1011
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,533
<i>Sometimes I wish I had</i>
<i>somebody else to say it to.</i>

1012
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:44,652
Coming!

1013
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:47,355
Coming!

1014
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:50,358
- Honey...
- <i> Doorbell.</i> Somebody's here.

1015
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:52,827
I didn't hear anything.

1016
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,596
<i>You gotta hide</i>
<i>under the stairs, you know?</i>

1017
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,564
- What?
- Hide under the stairs.

1018
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,867
<i>Hide under the stairs.</i>

1019
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,337
Brian.

1020
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,773
- You gotta go. You gotta go.
- What?

1021
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:08,209
You gotta go now.
What's happening?

1022
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:09,777
I way overslept, they're coming back.
They're gonna come back

1023
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,179
- any minute. We gotta... you gotta go.
- Okay, shh.

1024
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,181
You gotta go. You gotta go now.

1025
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:14,782
- You have to go.
- Did I do something wrong?

1026
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,584
No, no, no, but they're coming back.
Do you understand?

1027
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,787
And when they come back, it's
not gonna be a good scene.

1028
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:19,787
- Okay, listen to me. Shh.
- It's not gonna be a good scene.

1029
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,189
- Hey.
- What?

1030
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:22,624
You're a grown man

1031
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,859
and if you want me to stay,
you can just tell him.

1032
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:27,562
- No, I can't. I can't do that.
- Yes. This is your house.

1033
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,498
- No, no, no.
- Do you want me to stay?

1034
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,302
He's my legal guardian.
Do you understand?

1035
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:36,738
He can do things to me.
All right?

1036
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,835
I don't have any choice.
I don't have a choice.

1037
01:09:37,861 --> 01:09:38,406
You know what? Stop.

1038
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:40,375
- Please, Melinda, go.
- You can stand up to him.

1039
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:42,310
You... listen, you have...

1040
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:44,746
you have friends and family
and daughters

1041
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,414
that you're not allowed to see

1042
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,416
and it's not normal
and you deserve normal.

1043
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:50,952
- Stop.
- He could... he could send me away

1044
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:51,524
and throw away the key.

1045
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:52,787
He's manipulating you.
He's manipulating you.

1046
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,455
- No, he isn't. No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

1047
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:55,623
He's protecting me.
He's protecting me.

1048
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,791
No, you're protecting him.

1049
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:58,226
Listen, he is taking
advantage of you.

1050
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:59,961
He's over medicating you.

1051
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:01,963
I'm really... I think...

1052
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:04,499
I think that you know it, too.

1053
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:07,602
Please leave.
Please, I'm begging you.

1054
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,437
Leave, leave.

1055
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,707
Just leave, please.

1056
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,876
- Okay.
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me,

1057
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:18,546
- just go now.
- Do you want me to go or not?

1058
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,915
I want you to leave right now,
I don't want you to leave<i> me.</i>

1059
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:23,218
- Okay, okay. I'm not gonna leave you.
- Okay? Please, please, please.

1060
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,653
- Please, please.
- But I'm going. Calm down.

1061
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,456
- Please.
- Calm down. I'm going.

1062
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,577
<i>Last thing I want</i>
<i>to say right now is...</i>

1063
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:54,349
<i>I told you so,</i>
<i>so I'm not gonna say it.</i>

1064
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:57,112
<i>That's a whole lotta words for
something you're not saying.</i>

1065
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:00,455
"Pet Sounds" didn't sell.

1066
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:02,824
There, I said it. It flopped.

1067
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:05,460
- But critics loved it. <i>The
critics don't</i> buy albums.

1068
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:07,695
Well, Mike...

1069
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:10,031
the British
buy albums, you know?

1070
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:13,601
- <i> And they went crazy for it.</i>
- It's not even gonna go gold.

1071
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,838
When's the last time
that happened to us?

1072
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,807
- <i> Look, you know what I say?</i>

1073
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,910
Good. Good.
We got it behind us now.

1074
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,445
We can get back to our music.

1075
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,481
The proof is in the formula.

1076
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,449
Like Coca-Cola?

1077
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:29,984
And geometry?

1078
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:32,920
Penicillin and chicks.

1079
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,956
Earth to Brian.

1080
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,859
<i>- Cocaine is...</i>
<i>- Brian.</i>

1081
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,685
birthday cakes.

1082
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,296
You know, Paul McCartney
said that "God Only Knows"

1083
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,064
- <i> is the greatest song</i>
ever written, like...

1084
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:45,900
<i>That's because</i>
<i>it was a formula.</i>

1085
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,791
<i>Cuz...</i>

1086
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:24,659
Listen, about...

1087
01:13:24,685 --> 01:13:26,968
I have this song playing
over and over in my head.

1088
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,570
I just don't have
the words or the melody.

1089
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,741
Do you have anything?

1090
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,893
That's good.

1091
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,100
- <i> Well, piss on you,</i> Banana.

1092
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,835
<i>I like it.</i>

1093
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:05,139
You know, Mom told me once
when we were kids that

1094
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:08,776
dogs can pick up on vibes
from people like...

1095
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,945
like they know when we're happy

1096
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,915
- or sad or scared.

1097
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,083
Yeah, well...

1098
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:19,587
it's too bad we're not dogs.
Right?

1099
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:24,559
<i>Play that for me again.</i>
<i>There's something there.</i>

1100
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:25,793
<i>Really.</i>

1101
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,981
Good! Good, we got that part.

1102
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,617
Cut it. I wanna move to
Goldstar for the next part.

1103
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,019
Oh, not again.

1104
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,822
Okay, let's cut, please. Okay.

1105
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:03,558
So try to, um...

1106
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,160
more staccato, okay?
You guys are the rhythm now.

1107
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,696
Um, so, it's like an engine
underneath the song...

1108
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:11,599
Dennis, can you be quiet, please,
while we find the sound? Thanks.

1109
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:13,701
<i>Okay, let's try it again.</i>
<i>More broken up.</i>

1110
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:16,971
<i>- One, two, three, four.</i>

1111
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,247
<i>Okay, Scott, that sounds great.</i>

1112
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,215
<i>Let's see if we can, uh...</i>

1113
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:29,951
<i>take it even further now.</i>

1114
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:31,953
<i>So, like you're not</i>
<i>even playing the cello.</i>

1115
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:35,823
<i>Just, uh, like a propeller.</i>

1116
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,694
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1117
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,236
<i>Yes! Beautiful! I love it!</i>

1118
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,906
<i>Okay, stop. One more time. Okay,
and when we modulate there,</i>

1119
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,175
<i>it's like shifting gears,</i>
<i>so take... give me...</i>

1120
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:56,210
<i>Just remember to keep laying</i>
<i>into that change.</i>

1121
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,053
<i>Okay? One, two, three, four.</i>

1122
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,775
Okay, Chuck, let's cut
for a second, please.

1123
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:29,910
- Okay, let's go again, please.

1124
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,912
Let's think of this feel
a little harder. Okay?

1125
01:17:31,914 --> 01:17:34,649
A little stronger. Let's
really hit it now, okay?

1126
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:37,885
- Here we go!

1127
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,057
<i>Okay, one more time, please.</i>

1128
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,194
They know the...

1129
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:51,365
They're doing it! Brian, they've been
doing it for the past three hours!

1130
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,434
- Okay, Mike...
- Oh, my God!

1131
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,236
You can leave if you
don't want to be here.

1132
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:57,104
Thank you. I'm working
with the cello players.

1133
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,440
Okay, let's try it again, please.
One more time.

1134
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:01,876
- Take 32, here we go.
-

1135
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,794
Um, I would like
to make a toast,

1136
01:18:19,796 --> 01:18:22,229
um, to "Good Vibrations,".

1137
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:25,733
Brian's pocket symphony to God.

1138
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:28,936
And the best-selling single
the Beach Boys ever had...

1139
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:31,706
- ever.

1140
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,180
Brian, the suits
at Capitol must be happy.

1141
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:42,983
Yeah, I guess you can tell the record
company to go screw themselves.

1142
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:47,455
I mean, you can do
whatever you want, Brian.

1143
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:48,057
- <i> Right?</i>

1144
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,483
- Now what are you gonna
do with all that freedom?

1145
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:55,896
- Did my dad call?
<i>- No.</i>

1146
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,132
He hasn't. Do you
want me to get him?

1147
01:18:58,134 --> 01:19:02,203
Hey, Van, what do you
and Brian have cooking?

1148
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,771
<i>You know,</i> just your basic...

1149
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:05,906
American songbook,
neoclassical ditties.

1150
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,209
Basic Copland,
Gershwin, Hank Williams,

1151
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:11,078
- a little bit of
Irving Berlin and Kurt Weill.

1152
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,848
<i>Just a sprinkle of Beethoven</i>
<i>and the Beach Boys.</i>

1153
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,117
- <i> So nothing too ambitious.</i>

1154
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:18,419
- - Brian wants to call it...

1155
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,154
"Smile."

1156
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,484
Stop! Stop!

1157
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:52,453
Stop! Stop!

1158
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,023
- - Stop.

1159
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,094
Um...

1160
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:19,013
Hi, I should have called. I
brought matzo ball soup. What?

1161
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:22,349
<i>What's the goddamn song</i>
<i>called?! "Heaven Is A Car"!</i>

1162
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:25,052
<i>Helpful, healing music!</i>

1163
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:26,987
<i>Wait. You just have</i> to
just produce something!

1164
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,856
Shh. Shh. Shh.

1165
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:31,125
- Come on. <i>Put your hands
</i> on the keyboard...

1166
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:33,594
- Don't say nothing. The doctor's in there.
- <i> ...and make some noise</i>

1167
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:36,497
- <i> of some kind!</i> I don't care what it is...
- What's happening?!

1168
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:39,033
- <i> ...at this point!</i>

1169
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:42,903
Shh, shh. Come here.
Here, you sit down, you sit.

1170
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,410
It's too many. It's too many.

1171
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:52,346
I take away because
it makes him more crazy.

1172
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,849
Dr. Eugene give him too much.

1173
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:57,017
He's more<i> loco</i> than Mr. Brian.

1174
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,619
- It's too many pills...

1175
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:00,254
- and it makes him crazy.
<i>- Write the song!</i>

1176
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:02,223
- Okay, okay.

1177
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,992
<i>Gloria?!</i>

1178
01:21:04,994 --> 01:21:06,360
Go, go, go!

1179
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:08,896
<i>Gloria!</i>

1180
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:19,440
Oh. Hey, Melinda.

1181
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:22,476
- Hi, Gene.
- Wow, uh, what are you doing here?

1182
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,912
You know, I brought
Brian some soup.

1183
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:27,381
- Matzo ball.

1184
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,983
Jesus Christ.

1185
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:30,951
Um...

1186
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:32,353
this is like a sodium bomb.

1187
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,989
Brian cannot eat that. Sorry.

1188
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,325
Is... is he okay?

1189
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:41,262
He's great. He's never
been better, actually.

1190
01:21:41,264 --> 01:21:44,531
Gloria, can you make me a...
make me an Arnold Palmer?

1191
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,133
Thanks.

1192
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:48,269
So...

1193
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:51,538
uh... listen, actually, I'm
very glad that you're here.

1194
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:55,276
Um... we are finally
recording the new album

1195
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:56,543
and, um,

1196
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,013
Brian is working
on his autobiography.

1197
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,648
So he's very busy

1198
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:03,450
and he will not be able
to see you anymore.

1199
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,490
You can't do that, Gene.

1200
01:22:09,492 --> 01:22:12,359
Yes, I can.

1201
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:16,096
Melinda, honest to God,

1202
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,032
who are you
really thinking about here?

1203
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:20,567
Brian or yourself?

1204
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,002
<i>Thank you.</i>

1205
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,039
Well, I'd really like
to say goodbye to him.

1206
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,174
<i>Well, he's resting right now.</i>

1207
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,343
- Well, I can wait.

1208
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:32,608
My rules, Melinda, and
it's for his own good.

1209
01:22:32,634 --> 01:22:34,381
And yours, too, frankly.

1210
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:36,183
Can you make me
an Arnold Palmer, please?

1211
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,584
<i>What the hell is wrong</i>
<i>with you today?</i>

1212
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,486
<i>Just make me</i>
<i>a goddamn Arnold Palmer.</i>

1213
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,721
<i>Sure.</i>

1214
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,165
No.

1215
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,569
You have my sympathy.

1216
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,648
<i>Is this Audree Wilson?</i>

1217
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,084
<i>You don't know me,</i>
<i>but I am a friend</i>

1218
01:23:10,086 --> 01:23:12,219
<i>of your son, Brian.</i>

1219
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:14,488
<i>Well, I, um...</i>

1220
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:18,058
<i>I'm sorry, this is awkward</i>
<i>calling you out of the blue,</i>

1221
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,327
<i>but, um, well,</i>
<i>I'm just concerned</i>

1222
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:24,031
<i>that he is not</i>
<i>getting the best care.</i>

1223
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,467
<i>Oh, well, I met him</i>
<i>a few months ago.</i>

1224
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:29,470
<i>He came... I'm...</i>
<i>I sell Cadillacs.</i>

1225
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,640
<i>Carl, hi.</i>
<i>My name is Melinda Ledbetter,</i>

1226
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:36,243
<i>and Dr. Landy is...</i>

1227
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:40,481
<i>I... I understand that there
are some legal complications,</i>

1228
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:43,384
<i>so I... well...</i>

1229
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:45,753
<i>you know I just...</i>
<i>I wanted you to... to...</i>

1230
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,490
<i>What do you say, Brian?</i>

1231
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,225
<i>It's been over two hours.</i>

1232
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,829
I'm not sure.

1233
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:13,200
It's just hostile
in here right now.

1234
01:26:13,202 --> 01:26:14,735
The vibrations aren't right.

1235
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,751
Okay, let's cancel the session.

1236
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:34,188
<i>Are you sure? It's gonna cost
like $5,000, everybody's here.</i>

1237
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,422
Let's cancel it.

1238
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,194
I can't work.

1239
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:43,437
I don't know, the vibrations
are just all wrong tonight.

1240
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:53,874
<i>Two, three, go.</i>

1241
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,994
<i>- That was it. That was the one.</i>
<i>- Cut it, print it.</i>

1242
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:16,396
<i>That's about as good a job</i>
<i>as it's gonna get, right there.</i>

1243
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:23,937
<i>Don't have to be that way.</i>

1244
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:25,739
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

1245
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,008
<i>All right, it's late.</i>
<i>I know, let's go then.</i>

1246
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:30,050
<i>We're waiting around,</i>
<i>waiting on you.</i>

1247
01:27:33,515 --> 01:27:36,650
<i>Brian, we've been waiting</i>
<i>on you, man.</i>

1248
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:38,552
<i>Brian!</i>

1249
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:42,589
Brian, come on.

1250
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:45,859
<i>Brian, I thought we were</i>
<i>gonna have a serious meeting.</i>

1251
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:48,428
A band meeting.

1252
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,864
<i>Hey, you guys</i>
<i>shouldn't talk over there.</i>

1253
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:54,368
Let's everybody
come to the deep end.

1254
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,703
We can't stand
in the deep end, Brian.

1255
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:58,505
We're too shallow
for the deep end.

1256
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:00,907
Listen, cousin, we're not...

1257
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:02,710
we're not gonna let you
do this to us anymore.

1258
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:07,514
The lyrics on this album
do not make any sense.

1259
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:10,317
"To ride in the rough
and sunny down snuff"?

1260
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:12,052
<i>What is that?</i>

1261
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:13,954
<i>It's a gothic cowboy trip.</i>

1262
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:17,391
Brian, tell them. The lyrics
don't matter, all right?

1263
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:19,726
It's about the music. Throw the lyrics out.
They're just words.

1264
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,962
We need to throw you out.

1265
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,398
I'm telling you, Brian,
we need to destroy this shit

1266
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,533
- before it destroys us.
- Hey...

1267
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:29,536
everybody please whisper, let's...
let's come to the other side.

1268
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:32,472
<i>I have been writing lyrics
professionally since I was 14 years old.</i>

1269
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,942
- I don't need to be here.
- Good, then go! Please.

1270
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:38,845
It's safer for everyone
on the deep end!

1271
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:41,715
We have got to finish this album and
we are not gonna do it this way.

1272
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:43,350
Not in these fragments!

1273
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:44,818
Breaking it up
and moving us all around.

1274
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,953
The house is bugged.

1275
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:49,356
Okay, Phil Spector
has the house bugged.

1276
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:51,825
He's a violent gangster
and he's angry at me.

1277
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:55,095
Dad is listening
in all the time!

1278
01:28:55,097 --> 01:28:57,964
Just whisper, okay?!

1279
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:01,101
- I know what I'm talking about!
- We're not going to whisper, Brian!

1280
01:29:01,103 --> 01:29:02,803
Jeez.

1281
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,974
Tell him it's over.

1282
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,412
<i>You and I are going</i>
<i>to rewrite these songs,</i>

1283
01:29:12,414 --> 01:29:14,948
<i>put them together in a normal</i>
<i>album and get on with it.</i>

1284
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:18,552
Just us!

1285
01:29:18,554 --> 01:29:20,520
Family first, right?

1286
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,563
Okay, right, well...

1287
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:39,539
Now, can we have
a serious meeting now?

1288
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:42,142
I want to do a chanting album.

1289
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:45,045
Okay? No words.
All Hawaiian singing.

1290
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:48,081
And we can turn it into a
children's show for television.

1291
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,585
And it'll be
completely unstructured,

1292
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:55,155
and it'll be about animals
and eating right.

1293
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:04,498
Everyone.

1294
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:20,020
I'm worried about you, brother.

1295
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,560
I think I might be losing it.

1296
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:36,730
<i>I don't blame you.</i>

1297
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,668
There's a lot to lose
out there.

1298
01:30:49,645 --> 01:30:51,945
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

1299
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,653
<i>We just gotta</i>
<i>stick together, brothers.</i>

1300
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:08,446
We just gotta stick together.
It'll all be okay.

1301
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:36,723
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

1302
01:31:36,725 --> 01:31:38,725
Did you fire them, too?

1303
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:42,447
They're working
on the new album.

1304
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,868
They think they can simplify
what I was doing and release it.

1305
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:50,704
So, uh, to satisfy
the record company.

1306
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:53,640
"Smiley smile."

1307
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,711
Your masterpiece.

1308
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,015
Cheer up, I got good news.

1309
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:05,018
I sold the publishing rights
to A&M Records.

1310
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,787
$750,000.

1311
01:32:11,793 --> 01:32:13,593
What?

1312
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:16,730
I sold the rights
to the Beach Boys music.

1313
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:19,566
Got the most I could for it,
not as much as I wanted,

1314
01:32:19,568 --> 01:32:21,568
but something.

1315
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:24,604
They're...

1316
01:32:24,606 --> 01:32:26,773
our songs. You can't do that.

1317
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,210
Anyway, what are you
worried about it?

1318
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:35,048
They're never going to
amount to anything.

1319
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:37,751
You've peaked, Brian.
Look around.

1320
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:40,320
Five years from now no one
is gonna remember you

1321
01:32:40,322 --> 01:32:41,621
or the Beach Boys.

1322
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,338
What was I supposed to do?!

1323
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,007
That's all I got. You fired me!

1324
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:03,710
- Your own father.

1325
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,752
Now...

1326
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,655
maybe we can be a family again.

1327
01:33:31,974 --> 01:33:33,607
<i>So, in fact, you're saying</i>

1328
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,275
<i>that there should</i>
<i>be a code of ethics</i>

1329
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:37,744
- <i> that we abide by. Correct?</i>

1330
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:39,846
<i>Absolutely, and that's what</i>
<i>the entire argument's about.</i>

1331
01:33:39,848 --> 01:33:41,748
<i>Dan Rather just wanted</i>
<i>to get to the bottom</i>

1332
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:44,084
<i>of the Iran-Contra situation...</i>

1333
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:54,578
What do you want?

1334
01:33:54,604 --> 01:33:57,330
I'm sorry to bother you,
but he wants to see you.

1335
01:33:57,332 --> 01:34:00,000
- Now.

1336
01:34:00,002 --> 01:34:03,203
I have nothing
to say to that man.

1337
01:34:03,205 --> 01:34:06,272
I'm not talking
about Dr. Landy.

1338
01:34:06,274 --> 01:34:08,074
I'm talking about Brian.

1339
01:34:09,944 --> 01:34:12,112
Gene doesn't know I'm here.
Brian sent me.

1340
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:16,116
He needs you, Melinda.

1341
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:20,286
Can I take you to him?

1342
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:32,832
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

1343
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:36,136
I'm glad you came.

1344
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:41,174
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

1345
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:43,176
- Hey.
- Hi.

1346
01:34:44,312 --> 01:34:46,346
- Hi.
- Hi.

1347
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:49,049
- Hi.
- I'm sorry I couldn't come to see you.

1348
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,353
It's been a...

1349
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:55,455
Gene had to give me
a day off, you know?

1350
01:34:56,857 --> 01:35:00,160
It's been real, real busy.

1351
01:35:00,162 --> 01:35:01,761
He wouldn't let me out.

1352
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:05,799
Well...

1353
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:09,269
It's really hard
making a record.

1354
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:14,874
- You know?
- You don't... you don't look well.

1355
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:19,212
- Are you okay?
- Nuh-uh.

1356
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:23,149
I feel awful.

1357
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:25,919
I fall asleep everywhere I go.

1358
01:35:25,921 --> 01:35:29,255
I'm nauseous all the time.

1359
01:35:32,094 --> 01:35:34,461
Gene's really a tough
producer, you know?

1360
01:35:34,463 --> 01:35:36,429
I mean, I don't really, uh...

1361
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:38,398
know what he wants.
He's really demanding.

1362
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,499
And, uh...

1363
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:44,037
I'm, uh... I'm...

1364
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:46,906
I'm signing contracts
all the time and documents.

1365
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:49,375
Making record deals
and I don't know...

1366
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:52,045
I don't know what's ha... I
don't know what's going on.

1367
01:35:52,047 --> 01:35:54,514
- You know what I mean?
- Brian, you need...

1368
01:35:54,516 --> 01:35:57,417
- you need real care.
- I miss you. I miss my family.

1369
01:35:57,419 --> 01:36:00,987
I miss you. I wanna be with you.
You understand?

1370
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:02,355
- I wanna be with you.
- Okay.

1371
01:36:02,357 --> 01:36:03,490
- Okay?
- Okay.

1372
01:36:03,492 --> 01:36:05,258
But, I, um...

1373
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,926
I hear voices.

1374
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:10,096
I hear voices.

1375
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,465
- Since when?
- 1963.

1376
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:17,303
- Are you kidding?
- No kidding.

1377
01:36:17,305 --> 01:36:20,106
I just didn't tell you 'cause I
didn't want to scare you away.

1378
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,812
I'm right here.

1379
01:36:25,814 --> 01:36:28,014
- I'm right here.
- I can't live this life anymore.

1380
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:30,917
- Okay.
- It's a hellhole.

1381
01:36:30,919 --> 01:36:32,519
- Please.
- Then let's go.

1382
01:36:32,521 --> 01:36:34,420
I don't... how?

1383
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:36,322
You and me,

1384
01:36:36,324 --> 01:36:38,525
we're gonna walk outta
here right now.

1385
01:36:38,527 --> 01:36:41,227
- And everything
will change. Okay?

1386
01:36:41,229 --> 01:36:42,990
Yeah, that's what I want.
That's what I want.

1387
01:36:43,016 --> 01:36:43,430
Great.

1388
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:45,031
If you're ready, I'm ready.

1389
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:46,466
- Yes, I wanna be with you.
- I'm ready.

1390
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:48,802
- Okay.
- Let's... let's go.

1391
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:50,069
All right.

1392
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,174
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1393
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:59,110
Wow, it really sounds like I
missed something here. Huh?

1394
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:03,817
Hey, Brian?

1395
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:05,852
- Brian.
- Listen to me, man.

1396
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:07,520
No. - I'm really sorry
that you feel like

1397
01:37:07,522 --> 01:37:09,122
you live in a hellhole.

1398
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,959
I had no idea.

1399
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:14,961
You know, I've really tried to
make you feel comfortable, man.

1400
01:37:14,963 --> 01:37:16,863
Why can't I be with her, Gene?!

1401
01:37:16,865 --> 01:37:20,600
For the same reason, man, that
you cannot be with anybody.

1402
01:37:20,602 --> 01:37:22,368
You're sick.

1403
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:24,571
Look at you, man. You're sick,

1404
01:37:24,573 --> 01:37:26,206
but you're gonna get better.

1405
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:28,575
Come into the
control room, please.

1406
01:37:28,577 --> 01:37:31,544
- Let's walk out of here.
- Hey, what's it gonna take, Melinda?!

1407
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:34,113
A court order? You really
want to push it that far?

1408
01:37:34,115 --> 01:37:36,182
I told you to stay away.

1409
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:39,052
- Come on, let's go.
- If you stray from the program, you lose.

1410
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:41,387
Everything will change.
We'll walk out of here.

1411
01:37:41,389 --> 01:37:43,423
- <i> I can't be here.</i>
- You can see your friends and your family

1412
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:45,091
and you can get your life back.

1413
01:37:45,093 --> 01:37:47,460
- Brian, please.
<i>- Do you understand?</i>

1414
01:37:47,462 --> 01:37:48,865
- You asked me here. You
asked me to come here.

1415
01:37:48,891 --> 01:37:49,362
<i>If I let you go,</i>

1416
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:50,496
- <i> you're gonna spiral down.</i>
- Well, I'm here!

1417
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:53,132
I came! You'll come with me.

1418
01:37:53,134 --> 01:37:55,902
I love you. I love you.

1419
01:37:55,904 --> 01:37:56,658
And you're gonna die here.

1420
01:37:56,684 --> 01:37:58,137
<i>I'm gonna have to put
you</i> in an institution.

1421
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:00,440
Brian, look at me.

1422
01:38:00,442 --> 01:38:02,976
Look at me, stay with me.
Listen...

1423
01:38:02,978 --> 01:38:05,612
you need to get back
to your life.

1424
01:38:05,614 --> 01:38:07,480
You need to get back
to yourself.

1425
01:38:07,482 --> 01:38:09,482
Who you are inside.

1426
01:38:09,484 --> 01:38:12,118
Please, baby,
please come with me.

1427
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,487
There's no way out.

1428
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:15,449
No way out.

1429
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:23,129
<i>You know I love Brian.</i>

1430
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:25,331
<i>I love him very much,</i>

1431
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:29,569
<i>but with everything</i>
<i>that he's gone through...</i>

1432
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,986
<i>it feels a little selfish wanting
to be with him right now.</i>

1433
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:39,412
<i>I do not want to be</i>
<i>one more person in his life</i>

1434
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:41,294
<i>who wants something from him.</i>

1435
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,618
So I'm gonna walk away.

1436
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:53,126
But I cannot leave him
in that house with Gene.

1437
01:38:55,963 --> 01:38:58,064
I can't.

1438
01:38:58,066 --> 01:39:00,166
I can't even think
of him there.

1439
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:05,305
Gene is killing Brian.

1440
01:39:05,307 --> 01:39:06,539
Gloria, I know you know.

1441
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,441
You know better than anyone.

1442
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,576
You're seeing it every day.

1443
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:12,412
I need your help.

1444
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:20,386
Dr. Eugene said he's
gonna call immigration

1445
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:22,455
because he knows
I have no papers,

1446
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:26,159
- but I don't care.
- What he is doing to you,

1447
01:39:26,161 --> 01:39:29,429
to Brian, he is a monster.

1448
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:34,334
We cannot let this go on.

1449
01:39:34,336 --> 01:39:38,371
I just need something. Something
to bring to Brian's family.

1450
01:39:38,373 --> 01:39:41,641
Something we can use
against Gene.

1451
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:45,111
Help me.

1452
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:12,538
<i>Brian! Come in here!</i>

1453
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:15,775
<i>- I think she just smiled!</i>

1454
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:19,045
<i>Oh, man. Come... come see.</i>

1455
01:40:19,047 --> 01:40:23,016
<i>It's her first smile!</i>

1456
01:40:23,018 --> 01:40:25,485
<i>She's got your smile.</i>

1457
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:54,080
Oh, yeah.

1458
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:56,249
Oh, yeah, this is it.

1459
01:40:56,251 --> 01:40:57,817
<i>They find it in the printer.</i>

1460
01:40:57,819 --> 01:41:00,219
It's very lucky.
Very, very lucky.

1461
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:02,388
- <i> Sí.</i>
- Oh.

1462
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,424
Oh, this is it.

1463
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:06,392
Carl Wilson, please.

1464
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:10,463
Carl, hi.

1465
01:41:10,465 --> 01:41:12,565
It's Melinda Ledbetter.

1466
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:16,569
I'm fine. Thanks. Listen, I
have some important information

1467
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,571
that I need to share with you.

1468
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:23,109
<i>It's about your brother</i>
<i>and Dr. Landy.</i>

1469
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:25,244
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

1470
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:28,748
It's that way.

1471
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:33,519
Oh, really? Oh, wow.

1472
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:36,656
Her own little office, huh?

1473
01:41:36,658 --> 01:41:39,492
Private office. Wow.

1474
01:41:39,494 --> 01:41:42,974
Our little girl's really
moving up in the world, huh?

1475
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:45,565
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1476
01:41:45,567 --> 01:41:47,600
Don't tell me she's not here.

1477
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:50,436
- Dr. Eugene Landy?
- Yes, what?

1478
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:52,738
You've been served.

1479
01:41:59,146 --> 01:42:00,513
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

1480
01:42:00,515 --> 01:42:03,649
<i>Oh, you bitch.</i>

1481
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:06,886
<i>Um, do you think</i>
<i>that you've won, Melinda?</i>

1482
01:42:06,888 --> 01:42:11,657
Hmm? You know what? I'm gonna
beat this and I'm gonna beat you!

1483
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:15,394
Oh, my God.

1484
01:42:15,396 --> 01:42:18,431
You know, this kind of behavior
is so transparent.

1485
01:42:18,433 --> 01:42:21,767
It is so sick and manipulative!

1486
01:42:21,769 --> 01:42:24,637
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>that you are so different?</i>

1487
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:26,606
<i>Oh, my God. You...</i>

1488
01:42:26,608 --> 01:42:28,407
<i>slut!</i>

1489
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:30,877
Slut!

1490
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:34,280
And what is it?
What are you gonna do?

1491
01:42:34,282 --> 01:42:36,482
You're gonna make yourself
believe that you love him?

1492
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,885
Is that it?

1493
01:42:38,887 --> 01:42:42,388
<i>And that's gonna make you feel
better about yourself, isn't it?</i>

1494
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:45,391
<i>And it's gonna assuage</i>
<i>your filthy little conscience</i>

1495
01:42:45,393 --> 01:42:47,560
<i>while you are sucking him dry!</i>

1496
01:42:47,562 --> 01:42:50,630
<i>You are robbing him blind!</i>
<i>Well, get in line,</i>

1497
01:42:50,632 --> 01:42:53,199
<i>you little bitch!</i>

1498
01:42:54,569 --> 01:42:56,769
<i>Open the door!</i>
<i>I know you're in there!</i>

1499
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:28,935
You all right?

1500
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:33,439
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

1501
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:37,410
So, what are you gonna do now?

1502
01:43:41,949 --> 01:43:44,389
I'm gonna go sell some cars.

1503
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:21,954
<i>- You disgust me.</i>
<i>- ...they call you a genius.</i>

1504
01:44:21,956 --> 01:44:25,992
<i>- Well, I'm a genius, too.</i>
<i>- Family first.</i>

1505
01:44:25,994 --> 01:44:28,494
<i>- You are nothing.
- You stole everything</i> from me.

1506
01:44:28,496 --> 01:44:31,030
<i>- You're amazing.
- I want you to see</i> yourself dead.

1507
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:34,533
<i>- You're nothing.</i>
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

1508
01:44:34,535 --> 01:44:37,336
<i>I'm the way out.</i>

1509
01:44:37,338 --> 01:44:40,773
<i>- You need to get</i> back to your family. <i>
- I'm going to kill you.</i>

1510
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:42,808
<i>- A winner never quits...
- You need to get back</i> to yourself.

1511
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:44,710
<i>- Dad? Dad?
- ...and a quitter</i> never wins.

1512
01:44:44,712 --> 01:44:47,413
<i>- You need to get back to you.</i>
<i>- ...such a disappoint... Brian.</i>

1513
01:44:47,415 --> 01:44:49,282
<i>- Who you are.</i>
<i>- You disgust me.</i>

1514
01:44:49,284 --> 01:44:51,817
<i>- What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>- You need to get back to you.</i>

1515
01:45:14,742 --> 01:45:17,043
Brian.

1516
01:45:17,045 --> 01:45:18,477
Your dad...

1517
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:32,625
<i>How many times do I have
to tell you this, Brian?</i>

1518
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:17,370
<i>You don't do it all</i>
<i>by yourself, Brian.</i>

1519
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:19,805
<i>You need us as much as</i>
<i>we need you.</i>

1520
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:25,878
Brian, I love you! Get up!

1521
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,848
I won't desert you, Brian.

1522
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:30,449
Don't worry.

1523
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,122
Brian, I spoke to Carl,

1524
01:46:36,124 --> 01:46:38,004
he's gonna get you out of here.

1525
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:42,061
<i>They say I can't</i>
<i>see you anymore, Brian.</i>

1526
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:56,809
You need to find a way
to get back to yourself.

1527
01:47:12,026 --> 01:47:14,894
<i>Come find me, Brian.</i>

1528
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:45,177
Hi.

1529
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:49,181
- Hi!
- <i> How are you?</i>

1530
01:49:49,183 --> 01:49:51,784
Well, gee, you just
scared me half to death.

1531
01:49:51,786 --> 01:49:54,346
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.

1532
01:49:56,222 --> 01:49:57,723
What are you doing here?

1533
01:49:57,725 --> 01:49:59,258
Looking for you.

1534
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:06,365
Well, you look good.

1535
01:50:06,367 --> 01:50:08,167
You look really good, too.

1536
01:50:08,169 --> 01:50:09,868
Do you think it's a sign?

1537
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:13,038
- What?
- You almost killing me?

1538
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,241
I did not almost kill you. You
jumped in front of my car.

1539
01:50:15,242 --> 01:50:16,875
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, no, no.

1540
01:50:16,877 --> 01:50:18,911
Do you think we could
go out on a date again?

1541
01:50:18,913 --> 01:50:20,846
What?

1542
01:50:20,848 --> 01:50:22,815
Can we... me and you...
go out on a date?

1543
01:50:22,817 --> 01:50:25,117
Gene's gone. Look, I'm alone.

1544
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,719
Really.

1545
01:50:26,721 --> 01:50:28,153
I got some state-appointed
someone or another

1546
01:50:28,155 --> 01:50:30,155
managing all my things and...

1547
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:33,826
Could you at least
drive me home?

1548
01:50:33,828 --> 01:50:36,228
<i>Uh...</i>

1549
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:38,764
- <i> Right now?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

1550
01:50:38,766 --> 01:50:40,299
Brian, I...

1551
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:42,234
You know, I have
an appointment.

1552
01:50:42,236 --> 01:50:44,670
I'm on my way somewhere. I don't
think I can get all the way

1553
01:50:44,672 --> 01:50:46,238
- to Malibu right now.
- No, no, I don't live in Malibu anymore.

1554
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:48,040
I'm off the beach for good.

1555
01:50:48,042 --> 01:50:50,209
- Really?
- Just... let me get in. Just five minutes.

1556
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:53,345
<i>I wanna show</i>
<i>you something. Okay?</i>

1557
01:50:53,347 --> 01:50:55,381
- Let me show you something.
- Okay, getting in my car.

1558
01:50:55,383 --> 01:50:57,049
It'll just take a minute. Okay?
It won't take long.

1559
01:50:57,051 --> 01:50:58,917
- Okay, where are we going?
- Uh, take a right.

1560
01:50:58,919 --> 01:51:01,220
Turn your indicator on.
Yeah, okay, that way.

1561
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:05,124
So you live here now?

1562
01:51:05,126 --> 01:51:07,393
I didn't say I wanted you
to take me to where I<i> live.</i>

1563
01:51:07,395 --> 01:51:10,029
I said I wanted you
to take me<i> home.</i>

1564
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:11,764
This is where I grew up.

1565
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:13,198
I wanted to show you.

1566
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,668
All right, see that street?
119th Street?

1567
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:16,869
- Yes.
- See that street? Do you see it?

1568
01:51:16,871 --> 01:51:18,904
Take a left here.

1569
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,145
Uh-oh.

1570
01:52:28,274 --> 01:52:30,275
- You didn't know?
- Mmm.

1571
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,885
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

1572
01:52:39,887 --> 01:52:41,754
You want, maybe,
to go for a drive?

1573
01:52:41,756 --> 01:52:44,223
Or, maybe we could find
someplace to drive together?

1574
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:51,964
And then what?

1575
01:52:55,068 --> 01:52:57,035
Hmm?

1576
01:54:49,016 --> 01:54:51,149
Thank you.

1577
01:56:58,378 --> 01:57:01,380
Good night, everybody.
Drive safely.

1578
02:00:45,271 --> 02:00:47,005
<i>Okay, it'll be at this tempo.</i>

1579
02:00:47,007 --> 02:00:48,873
<i>One, two,</i>

1580
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:50,942
<i>one, two, three, four.</i>

1581
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,811
<i>One, two...</i>

1582
02:00:52,813 --> 02:00:54,346
<i>How far are we going, Brian?</i>

1583
02:00:54,348 --> 02:00:56,514
<i>Where we were originally. Uh...</i>

1584
02:00:56,516 --> 02:00:58,583
<i>as soon as, uh... let's see...</i>

1585
02:01:01,455 --> 02:01:05,924
<i>Count it, please. One,
two, one,</i> two, three.

1586
02:01:29,582 --> 02:01:31,449
<i>All right, hold it</i>
<i>for a second, please.</i>

1587
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,612
<i>Just rest for one second.</i>
<i>I'll be right out.</i>
