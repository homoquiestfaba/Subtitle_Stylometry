- Whatever that was.

hate your opponent to win.

Oh, really, Dad?
And how did that work out for you?

I heard you're all doing really well.

Well, just a few techniques
my mom taught me.

So, Claudette, we're all thinking
we have a chance to win.

We do.

Oh, Kate, you should have seen Nars.

Wait. Nars,
from the Northern pack?

547
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,324
Yeah. You left him a lasting memory
with your turnout.

He is so “Bitter cave for one.”

And the way he treats his son, Fleet?

it was really important to me too.

Hmm.

Well, winning is fun.

555
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,824
But I think digging down deep
and seeing what you're truly made of...

556
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,451
is what really counts.

- Well, yeah.
