1
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,027
I'm traveling.

2
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:43,458
Something is wrong. I do not feel well.

3
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,732
I came back here a few days ago, in this poor country,

4
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,765
To this poor and frightening country.

5
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:12,930
There is small war going on.
And the rebels keep blowing up the electricity towers.

6
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,200
Our hotel foresight
provide candles.

7
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:45,295
Sit on these cold square tiles in the cold night

8
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,618
Cold in hand and I can not stand.

9
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:09,408
Suddenly for a moment I see myself from the outside,
as if I were looking at myself.

10
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,384
From the outside I looked like so many other people.

11
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:23,813
For example I am really really quite similar to my neighbor Jean,

12
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:28,204
If you consider simply the external facts about me.

13
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:34,242
The point is that I've never been interested in external facts.

14
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:40,306
I could easily fit all the facts about my life in one slim book.

15
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:48,240
And it's a book I would never want to read because it would be too boring.

16
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:53,152
Chapter 1
I was born. I went to school.

17
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,880
Chapter 2
Rest. I got married, had children, are divorced.

18
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,327
Worked, work, entertainment
holidays,

19
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:09,283
parties, calls, clothing, but it was not me.

20
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:13,526
What difference have I,
this is my private life.

21
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:18,082
What I think about things
how I feel about things

22
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,417
what I like.

23
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,281
I love Beytan.

24
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,161
I love to watch violinist
playing with strings.

25
00:05:57,294 --> 00:06:02,948
At night I like to go to Cosmopolitan,
where I lived all my life.

26
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:08,462
City where born and
my children grew up.

27
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:16,822
I love the city lights. Cafes, bookstores, theaters

28
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:24,671
I love to sit in a dark box and watching dancers migration in the end.

29
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,161
30 years ago when I was a kid

30
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:42,454
Did you know? My parents loved me and taught me to think about people.

31
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:47,521
World, humanity, beauty.

32
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:56,747
And they gave me a book for people with many different uniforms who came home to help my family

33
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:03,393
postman with a mail, supplier of store, and all so polite,

34
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:11,183
even the street where we live there are so many things to watch and at the end of the street

35
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:18,026
a strange old woman works in the bakery, which gives me a chocolate muffin.

36
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:22,227
Parents told me about
wonderful trip.

37
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:29,315
I remember a marvelous train, imagining that travel through night at the ranch real surprise.

38
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:36,178
When I think of childhood I remember Christmas and wonderful gifts.

39
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:41,457
There's always had a box
that was so perfect

40
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:45,735
as we thought might to have someone inside but it was just too much.

41
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,775
And when you open the box... Inside was another box which was always a shiny package.

42
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,870
And finally come to the gift.

43
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:03,630
Sometimes it was small object which could be very beautiful wooden object

44
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:08,670
but in the meantime without any doubt with all its splendor,

45
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,027
seemed the most radiant
thing in the world.

46
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,835
How fine it seemed
how fragile, how precious.

47
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:24,950
My friends and I also were exquisite, priceless and fragile children.

48
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:29,317
And he always knew knew him because of the way for taking care of us.

49
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,045
Our beds were furnished with soft sheets, our shoes and socks with soft to keep our feet.

50
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,277
My dear mother told us, you must be very careful.

51
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:43,731
Do not go to play below the railway station there are bad people from the neighborhood.

52
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:49,059
Good people kept us in our neighborhood, very good neighbors,

53
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:55,601
but as the railway station in other regions bad people gathered together.

54
00:08:55,636 --> 00:09:01,041
And all the neighbors shun them,
because poor people and fighting people.

55
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:07,778
Still circumvent them by
my friends, bad neighborhoods.

56
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:15,432
People who live in places like these, will hurt, I'll beat up, I'll stab will kill you.

57
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:23,107
Bad people gather in these neighborhoods, as rain water.

58
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:33,252
I always detour Dangerous places but had to come back here

59
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:42,370
Even if I felt I the floor in the bathroom, in this country
no books written my language,

60
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,206
numbers written after the street
Is it dull finish the story of my life.

61
00:09:54,451 --> 00:10:02,382
I'm not sure why, but something started happening to me after I went in Europe.

62
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:09,048
I began to learn certain things of which was not paying attention.

63
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:14,095
Maybe it all began one day when I was in art gallery

64
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:19,342
You see dear, are rich
pigs, so it's simple.

65
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:22,045
- What? All right?
- Just say it.

66
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,128
The woman there was clearly seedy. Spotting all professed by Marx.

67
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,853
She can not speak
so for the rich.

68
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:38,941
Say that, tells us that the way use science is the same.

69
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:47,430
I know ordinary people are terrible and I know a few rich, are extremely pleasant.

70
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:49,905
I do not care whether
pleasant or not.

71
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:54,376
What I say is that anything to do with the world all of which deal, suppress society.

72
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:59,384
And when you are miles with officers or miles with dogs, miles with friends or miles with any f.

73
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,468
The ruling class is
ruling class.

74
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:11,149
I've heard these words and phrases throughout their lives, but I never met someone to use them.

75
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:21,922
And then wherever you go looking for people to think for the same things who said the woman from the gallery.

76
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:27,671
Go for it, take it, unprecedented opportunity. land bargains what a joke.

77
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:35,797
But one day, course, someday. help us to pay it.

78
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:45,023
I began to think that maybe I'm crazy. I thought this was unreasonable, really is happening.

79
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:52,566
All except us are greedy bastards. Now I am all you are communists?

80
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:59,941
But communism is dead a long time. Now it appears that was reborn again.

81
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:03,791
Why are all these people
old age trying to take from me.

82
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:12,530
One day I found an anonymous gift complex input staircase.

83
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:22,236
Joke, I seriously, I do not think.

84
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,885
I lay down tonight
and started her unteach

85
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:39,212
The beginning was invincible, I could not figure it out.

86
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,447
When I reached the section
lives of workers

87
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,659
workers from the factories.

88
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:54,538
I felt how I started
breathe more slowly.

89
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:01,464
How scary it was, Hate on the pages.

90
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:08,875
Then I came back again to previous section to try to figure out not what I was before.

91
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:15,533
Weird, disturbing or ugly phrases cult to mainstream products.

92
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:26,478
I tried to tell them these phrases, but I can say to understand that my entire life must be totally changed.

93
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,307
He explains that every single thing depending on the types, expressed by its value.

94
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:42,285
This cup of coffee, this time, this coat. Everything has its value or is part of something else.

95
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:48,544
We say that the coat is not part this kind of stuff because we believe that the coat

96
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,399
even doubt that piece of clothing it has its own soul

97
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,136
this is a cult idol. live spirit.

98
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:06,411
But what really is the origin
the value of the coat.

99
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:15,285
The price of the coat comes from history, history of the people involved in producing and selling their

100
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:21,227
and the mode of communication, who had. and buy coats

101
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:25,316
we form relationships
with these people.

102
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:35,223
And if you try to hide that our relationships, then pretend that we live in a world without history.

103
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,813
Just frustrating to heaven with more profit for us. We say we like this coat, because it is expensive.

104
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:50,503
And if it is a fact that for a coat, it is not the end of history for all people who make and sell them.

105
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:59,870
For 2 days I saw cult to mainstream goods everywhere in the streets.

106
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,896
This is quite a strange feeling.

107
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:19,269
Then on the fourth day I lost it, it disappeared, I could not see him anymore.

108
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,530
How long are you waiting for?
- Almost half an hour.

109
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:38,730
- Maybe something is wrong.
- Yes.

110
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,980
Your earrings are beautiful.
- Thank you.

111
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,766
Write anything on them?
What does it mean?

112
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:53,942
Well, I guess

113
00:15:55,916 --> 00:16:02,766
that the closest meaning would be if people are united, they will not be injured.

114
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,462
So simple.

115
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,093
Where did you get them?

116
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:17,609
That was a gift from my
friends from my village.

117
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,610
She told me that they come from a country
they have visited.

118
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:28,561
When I saw the joy on their faces, people gathered together I was surprised and really ...

119
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,174
Place for which I know nothing.

120
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:38,924
... When the plane went down I was overwhelmed by these unusual colors, their flavor people who are ...

121
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,015
How I described the her trip.

122
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:49,019
This is an old coin Virginia, they are not used, so that they make me feel beautiful.

123
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,183
This was not my bus.

124
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:15,934
6 months later I went to a party

125
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:21,123
which I took many drinks.

126
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:04,920
After the party,
I did not want to drink for quite a while.

127
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,428
What are you doing here?

128
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,842
Absolutely nothing.

129
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,579
Fee you waiting for?

130
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:35,604
- Are you a friend Phyllis?
- No, Jake.

131
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:41,514
- Jake, marble substrate.
- What does this mean?

132
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,835
This Jake is very short
name for it.

133
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:48,537
Finally.

134
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,738
- Please come.
- Thanks.

135
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:17,540
- Hey, man. Can I kindle.
- No, sorry.
- Okay.

136
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:24,817
Can it not kindle a light. There you go.

137
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:28,692
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course, any f.

138
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:32,402
I could not understand your accent.
Where are you from?

139
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,924
From a small country ... I

140
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:45,431
It turned out that he comes from the same party where have pierced woman from the bus stop.

141
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,289
A few years ago they killed each other.

142
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:56,042
The war left a mark in
their hearts in their desires.

143
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,570
He served as ambassador.

144
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:05,666
Now everything was wonderful. And they can to indulge in dreams,

145
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:10,665
to live together, can dream together

146
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,046
They are all wonderful people, wonderful.

147
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,346
- Is it difficult to go in your country?
- Not at all.

148
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:25,158
- There are direct flights to the capital 3 times a week
- Really?
- Yes.

149
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:31,696
- Do you plan any trip soon?
- Well, sometimes close his office.

150
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:38,609
You can visit us now safe, trust me. You see this beautiful country.

151
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:46,600
I had a vision of how I sat the plane if I had decided to go.

152
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:51,887
At the end of the month, I told my office
that will take leave for several weeks.

153
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:56,128
And I went to the airport
to wait for the flight.

154
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:24,350
- Welcome to our country, pleasant day.
- Thank you.

155
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:30,017
Ambassador told me that a friend
with legal revolutionaries in the country.

156
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:49,346
I know that visitors can being misled by ocharovatelnostta of this place managed by the brutal regime.

157
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:56,988
I never believed in the revolution because I think power may itself elect necessary leaders.

158
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:11,309
They were more soldiers It is undisputed, but more like live shepherds of Renaissance paintings.

159
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:15,238
- Where is the tourist office?
- Yes, I know.

160
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:29,358
I met an employee who invited me
in his office to talk.

161
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:35,419
He said the government takes from
people to have more food for them.

162
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:39,230
before the revolution obey only two people

163
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,049
and now many people work and their divide everything.

164
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:57,040
You can see that one of the problems we have here is that most people in the streets no names,

165
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,000
and sometimes is very difficult to find people.

166
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:06,577
and therefore most of our
people have the same families.

167
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,450
- How to fix?
- Very difficult.

168
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:15,664
Of all these folders here each represents a village

169
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:24,084
where more than 90% people can not read, this is amazing.

170
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:13,100
And then ocharovatelnostta
People enchant me.

171
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:36,435
I went there with my husband.

172
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,466
- This must have been a nice trip.
- It was.

173
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:46,260
Well, in this country I am more
10 years.

174
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:51,628
Really? I read in newspapers
that people move elsewhere.

175
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:59,501
Yes, my boss tried to me give another good place, but I do not know me I like it here.

176
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:05,630
When my sister moved, I gave up. There is always a magazine in which to work.

177
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:13,058
I also like this place even though the ice cream is so open, so clean and beautiful

178
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:18,041
and we can get this ice cream
home, even the best place.

179
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:22,912
Yes, dear. They are very proud of their ice cream.

180
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:28,452
But, you know that milk ice cream really necessary for children

181
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,903
- and not much of it here.
- No?

182
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:39,290
The truth is that government argued that that most people in the world understand what is happening in this country.

183
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,160
So hotels only because the Ministry of Tourism actually take all milk.

184
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:51,295
Because the profits of the country more like make a good impression of visitors like you

185
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:55,740
than to give milk
children what they need.

186
00:25:56,706 --> 00:26:04,046
I do not know, I guess they have the right, but I do not think so dying people's revolution.

187
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:15,210
They have tried to share this with
world through visitors

188
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:20,777
and this is a form of ice cream
communication

189
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:27,430
This is the truth, they have tried to show what kind of society would like to build someday.

190
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:33,906
They never had no economy I really use and better society to be full of good things.

191
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:41,740
in the sense of contrast terrible statistics between rich and other people countries, I guess.

192
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:46,900
- Have you seen such nonsense?
- No, I have been in other countries in the region.

193
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:55,113
Oh, really! You should go, to see at least 2 of them otherwise you can not appreciate what make a revolution here.

194
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:01,525
If only cross the border 3 km north of here will see the places under the control armies of death squads

195
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:05,331
where people do not even
dream of change.

196
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:13,200
Instigation of the facts, of course, they say they have a democracy and make choices every four years.

197
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:19,232
- Elections for the people, I say this?
- Oh, no. Indeed, elections are remarkably honest.

198
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:26,420
Just over the years leaders intervene elections, and they can not be made to change for U.S. forces here.

199
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:32,272
Works very well. That's why I'm here.

200
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:39,040
Watch revolution. People face every day go to work for the benefit the rich.

201
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,679
And no one believes that they want
be different.

202
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:53,593
I read that the country was terrorized of the death squads and I never wanted to see one of them.

203
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,442
But I was intrigued by this
what you say.

204
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:03,735
I decided that we should see them in person.

205
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,003
Journalists advised me to
visit the respective office

206
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:50,883
where to collect evidence what happens day after day.

207
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:58,994
We try to keep records in cases of political killings and torture.

208
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:06,927
Also rape, rapists use system to torture, specific system of torture.

209
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:19,629
This is my friend. We went to school together, then she became a teacher.

210
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:23,128
She said that they need from school.

211
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:29,952
- Te shot in January to school in.
- Why?

212
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,748
This was the choice for some people
that the fight is the only way.

213
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:45,804
She was murdered by people who feared go to the funeral in.

214
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:49,223
But they went anyway.

215
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:11,238
People from my office told an interesting church which could visit on Sunday.

216
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,809
He knew there permanently
a young woman.

217
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,250
- Thank you.
- It's okay. Well you've come.

218
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:11,646
- You speak English?
- Yes, less than college.

219
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,666
Cover your head.

220
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:22,203
Then the priest began to
talking excitedly.

221
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:31,473
I felt that we should speak for terrible things. Violent, death.

222
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:43,198
He says we must learn to forgive your enemies. Even if we look hard and much impossible.

223
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:54,902
He says that God loves infinite mercy and and we must be the same.

224
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:30,326
- I'm afraid that must be back.
- Well, there is a bus stop, which is not far away.

225
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,930
Povarvyahme together for less and stopped at a farm.

226
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:46,508
The government ordered bitterly set fire to barns and kill all the animals.

227
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:54,742
Then the rape and beatings girls. And then hanged them.

228
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,653
They made it from there.

229
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:12,976
He said he is interested in music what not to learn English University? When was that?

230
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:18,116
I did not think I have enough
talent to devote to music.

231
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:22,221
And after university I went to
France right?

232
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,115
He wanted to know more about
English in France?

233
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,649
- No, I. ..
- What?

234
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:39,265
It is difficult to explain it. There was a guy who offered me work in France. I knew him.

235
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:44,063
- His wife was in love with me.
- Why do you think so?

236
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:47,976
Twice she took me shopping for clothes.

237
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:53,685
No need for clothes. She bought them to compensate me.

238
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:57,666
- Does your spa with her husband and either?
- No

239
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,791
Well, once I did,

240
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:15,461
but mostly it was able for some time.

241
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:22,170
- How long was there?
- Why do you want to know so much for me?

242
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:25,279
Because I want to know if
to confide in you or not.

243
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:30,646
Look.

244
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,199
I am one of those people
against the government.

245
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:44,328
And she told me about all this.

246
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:50,635
We do not want to fight us.

247
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:55,262
I am a good mother, I'm not bad.

248
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:06,818
Want to know why why we die and forced.

249
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:13,997
They seem to want everything.

250
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:24,565
And this group of rich people began to steal land and to build on it for hundreds over the years.

251
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:27,799
They their
returned legally rocky hills.

252
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,891
She has not returned home a long time. She loves her parents and has
two small children.

253
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:39,440
Her husband died at 20.

254
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:48,233
My sister was never involved in politics. She was a nurse and worked hospital.

255
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:55,620
She went to dances every Sunday

256
00:35:57,017 --> 00:36:03,272
and then she was walking with a boy who met the dance

257
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,731
And then everything goes wrong, because government was very interested by his brother

258
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:17,792
but my sister never met his brother. But they said she did.

259
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:24,153
So one day they came home
and then beat,

260
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,100
and they shall beat.

261
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:33,257
Then it

262
00:36:36,142 --> 00:36:38,140
died.

263
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,555
I thought I can not go.

264
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,778
I thought, why not kill me.

265
00:36:51,136 --> 00:36:52,866
But no.

266
00:36:54,472 --> 00:37:02,354
So that left the children, with my parents. I left town.

267
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:09,626
And I walk in to the mountains and found the rebels.

268
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:28,029
Sitting in a cafe the in a wealthy part of town.

269
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:35,974
Seem does it what I've seing and heared could impossibly be happening.

270
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,631
Back home, I went back
normal life.

271
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,417
But I can not detect how everything seemed different.

272
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:25,704
Initially I tried To ignore this feeling manner and ignore some symptoms to heal.

273
00:38:26,211 --> 00:38:28,154
But it did not go away.

274
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:41,009
I met Jeff several years ago,
but I had not seen long ago.

275
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:55,371
Talking about memories and places
we visited, as a movie.

276
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,195
Terrible things that we learned.

277
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:04,678
I forgot to ask how
deal father.

278
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:12,108
Well, he ... I fear that

279
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:21,367
- When did it happen?
- I had to say earlier

280
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:25,378
- He went to therapy, but I think that it was angry.
- Angry?

281
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:28,900
Yeah, it was common story
how bad to hospital

282
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:37,210
I did not expect to be the best hospital in the world, but many pay enough money every day.

283
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,265
The most incredible is that never
I asked what this is about.

284
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:48,450
And if you ask doctors, they
they look like

285
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:56,210
I told him one day, not asking to do predictions or to say a diagnosis,

286
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,280
please treat me as a human being

287
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,890
but I cry for five minutes in his office listen to my questions, because my father died.

288
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:14,369
These were the words of a man who is not death occurred before. He felt that was unfair that his father had to die.

289
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:19,757
It is expected that you can not
provide after-care for his father.

290
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:28,724
Finally, at the very end there were six sisters, making it not to think about death.

291
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:40,338
You know, I think is so interesting.

292
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:48,691
There was six sisters who are tried to save dad or at least help him die without feeling any pain.

293
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:54,785
And then... a the other end of the world if
people lie in bed like,

294
00:40:55,453 --> 00:41:04,625
without enough mass and can not be made by beds. And everything they can

295
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:13,071
to die in a terrible agony, incredible agony.

296
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:23,531
My advice was to go somewhere. where to sympathize with my friend.

297
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:35,189
Sometimes I feel so good in a beautiful morning when her hair done.

298
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,779
I went to buy tights

299
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:52,627
Buy as many because it is not easy to find exactly what I like.

300
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:01,377
I went to a birthday party with my neighbor.

301
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:11,261
She told me about affair with an unknown man, the movie that upset her,

302
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:16,428
actress, psychiatrist, the criminals

303
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:23,898
who walk around at night country with insatiable appetite for violence, sex.

304
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:34,939
Unpredictable things put me in
emotional state.

305
00:42:36,275 --> 00:42:43,022
Of 2000 km from here, a woman guard shoots two in robbery, and now it will be executed.

306
00:42:50,797 --> 00:42:53,652
I could not stop thinking
for this woman.

307
00:43:00,563 --> 00:43:02,563
What fits.

308
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:08,238
I've always thought about happy person. I love life.

309
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,728
What are you waiting for then
time to go.

310
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:20,842
I went to play with
friends.

311
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:29,964
'And now watching it for so long, with such tender affection.

312
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,286
I watched her character, to retain its soul. It is probably now living in apartment in Paris.

313
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:45,223
Amanda's father wanted it to work for family, the house where she grew up.

314
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:57,466
- My sister. My sister.
- My beloved, my precious, my joy.

315
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:02,170
My life, my needs, my happiness. Goodbye.

316
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:10,998
This person will not remain long alone. In return, she must live
in an apartment.

317
00:44:14,326 --> 00:44:19,673
I could not remember why I should be negligible.

318
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:25,128
- You snooze?
- No, no.
- Doze, I'm generous.
- No

319
00:44:25,554 --> 00:44:31,022
- It was amazing! Do not you understand?
- It was good.
- Why worry?

320
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,799
Because all these things rear their
such a reaction to it.

321
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:38,811
- Maybe just what she wanted.
- No, I can not hear it.

322
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:44,457
What happens to me, I feel no longer believe in anything.

323
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:49,208
All have their beliefs,
everyone believes a particular thing.

324
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,387
My neighbor believes...
- Store make me feel guilty of families in Africa which have nothing to eat.

325
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:03,004
What should I do for
families in Africa?

326
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:09,444
Plane to catch and bring to
Africans salad for lunch.

327
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:14,382
And Fred, he also believes.
- I love to drink champagne.

328
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:20,971
Also the woman that I clean apartments, but the difference is I can not afford it.

329
00:45:21,464 --> 00:45:23,931
And now what you feel
bad because of this?

330
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,359
I'm sure if you change the locations it will feel the same for me.

331
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:36,043
Mario believes that:
- People are selfish. It is human nature.

332
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:42,040
If I find money, I will spend them alone,
rather than someone I have not seen before.

333
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:47,003
Natasha believes that:
- I vote to bring money home

334
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:53,635
trying to be a friend people who meet. this is all I can do to make the world a better place.

335
00:45:54,882 --> 00:46:00,833
Life is not fair, some people have good moments others have bad moments, so it happens.

336
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:09,350
Anne-Marie believes that:
- I have money in your wallet, because I earned this money, after much hard work.

337
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:17,307
But honest people work hard. I'm not saying that is our fault do not we create rules, but have to ask

338
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:22,881
Why work to bring more money home and they are practically nothing.

339
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:36,442
Until you come christmas, and festive spirit conquered the streets and shops.

340
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:43,587
The season makes me think for children, and all people who have kids.

341
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:47,546
Therefore, children are born worldwide.

342
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:55,152
To be able to walk one day on the streets buying always best.

343
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:05,673
Do you really need more children? I will have more wealth for people in the world

344
00:47:06,086 --> 00:47:14,578
for all who already have? but not enough people already not need help and nothing at all.

345
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,601
Of course, I'm one of them, but who has decided to hurt.

346
00:47:22,062 --> 00:47:25,876
I do not know want I think. for all the things I know I like that.

347
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:29,362
I know what I like.
I like the heat

348
00:47:30,062 --> 00:47:33,113
convenience, joy, love

349
00:47:33,696 --> 00:47:41,530
Gifts and good plays.

350
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:48,430
But how come these items. Plays, Gifts

351
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,337
What happens so that these things are not made for everyone.

352
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:57,979
Of course only a few limited
units in the world

353
00:47:58,348 --> 00:48:03,839
every day make limited pieces of things, some things more than others ..

354
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:07,086
Who tells them what to do.

355
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,180
The power of money.

356
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:15,160
They have money for things they want.

357
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:21,337
They need money to have
fraction of daily activity.

358
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:28,062
And people who have little give little, have much to give much

359
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:33,508
and people who have nothing
give nothing.

360
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:39,040
And workers are subject
the instructions of money.

361
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:46,087
Money to say what is grown and on what sites to send, where children die of hunger.

362
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,702
And telling others to sew costumes
and repairing violins

363
00:48:53,169 --> 00:49:00,969
Every day is a great time before opening the shop

364
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,044
this moment of confusion.

365
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:15,576
Money is silent, not even to talk, but determine health, balance and strengthening.

366
00:49:18,174 --> 00:49:22,158
World can not make
all for today

367
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,726
If the food they provide for starving children does not deliver on time

368
00:49:29,026 --> 00:49:34,601
if the army fails to deliver security with
food to children

369
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:39,394
they will die.

370
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:49,506
At the end I had a dream in which I was very young mother during Christmas.

371
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:43,020
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

372
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:48,828
Just more I can not give
gifts to anyone.

373
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:58,413
I love you all. But I can not give you more gifts.

374
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,942
I told my office that will
taking another week off.

375
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:41,625
I felt that maybe I should go back split in this cold country.

376
00:51:52,869 --> 00:51:55,662
Maybe it was the place
where we had to go.

377
00:51:55,962 --> 00:52:01,649
If I die in this terrible, this awkward ..

378
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:09,287
Where it went. What's up with me, I feel, I feel like nothing is left in me, I feel that

379
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,284
I can not think of anything
I do not believe in anything

380
00:52:13,602 --> 00:52:17,622
No, not stop it. Everyone believes in certain things.

381
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:24,633
People in countries simply beautiful want to learn, be in mental peace and silence.

382
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:32,306
And it may be insensitive to rights ideology or to escape.

383
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:39,703
Makers in the social plays and films may be more expressive, using humor.

384
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:44,779
Artists including parts opera and ballet

385
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:49,221
People can change separately and through them society.

386
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:53,256
All must cooperate to
people can help the trees

387
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:59,816
solve the problems of the world helping all families are not important ..

388
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:08,600
Rich and poor must live as friends and work together to make future better than the past.

389
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:11,406
Today rebels
tomorrow's dictators.

390
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:17,304
Western democracy is form of government come from all others.

391
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:25,276
But the question is what really matters if we have Fred, Robert and Bob

392
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,725
who believe that democracy is Western form of government among others,

393
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,975
and if Fred wakes and continues to believe in it.

394
00:53:35,904 --> 00:53:41,309
This is like believing only his friend Bob, but what does that mean something that

395
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:44,275
I can not even remember
my beliefs.

396
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:53,471
What is the thing I always say? Yes, that's exactly, I like beauty.

397
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:07,388
Country is very poor
beautiful.

398
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:18,260
Honest people are beautiful. Have a very amazing feeling in the country where most people are poor.

399
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:22,387
To ride in a taxi to
terrible places.

400
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:40,393
Can be 10 times more beautiful, may have more beautiful eyes.

401
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:46,338
Appear sick, but those have adapted, lighting...

402
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:52,374
no money in their pockets, they help each other.

403
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:57,294
Why are not all that?

404
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,395
Why not give it all you got?

405
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,737
Answering this question.
We simply live.

406
00:55:21,227 --> 00:55:23,972
I can not give more than I have.
Wait a minute.

407
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,020
I have faith. That is why we can not give more of my money, the reason

408
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:42,818
What I imply that I give them. In fact, I always gave gifts people from whom I have been interested.

409
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,230
- Yes...

410
00:55:47,236 --> 00:55:53,503
There should be no reason put money first not because I follow some time.

411
00:55:54,185 --> 00:56:00,225
I work for the money, I work hard for the money. I earn money and therefore they have

412
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:06,277
and I can spend them on whatever I want. This is a way of life

413
00:56:07,346 --> 00:56:12,046
so I can stay in this hotel
I am paid with money.

414
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:21,075
And because I can stand here, I can be served. I expect certain things
be made.

415
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:27,369
For example morning maid left my room in disarray.

416
00:56:28,978 --> 00:56:33,580
What is it, I do not
clean sheets.

417
00:56:34,379 --> 00:56:38,841
I paid to stay here, I paid to
be served and expected services.

418
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:43,910
But I'm not the maid serve as needed. Which is wrong.

419
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:06,530
Should I feel bad
the woman has no money. There you have work?

420
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:12,153
Certainly there is work
where do your job well.

421
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:18,798
Probably works 16 hours a day, field in the factory.

422
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:23,632
It works, Chambermaid work.

423
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:26,112
You say that making money.

424
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:30,254
What a wonderful expression.

425
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:37,216
How can do so so much for so little time. When we have so some time.

426
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:05,383
Now that I see in
imprisonment with a strict regime.

427
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
- Read the book! Read it!

428
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,676
God left my book.

429
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:40,454
And she looks very familiar. The book has never I read.

430
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,413
The book has never
I wanted to read.

431
00:58:53,623 --> 00:58:57,524
In what country I grew up,
in any city on any street.

432
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,678
My real parents
color of their skin.

433
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:07,292
Who have made money, what I felt, what I said.

434
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:15,525
Yes, I understand that. See replies my difficult questions.

435
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:23,192
Why your job brings you so much money until their work is not offers them virtually nothing.

436
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:32,821
Can not provide from the knowledge of where I born, how I grew up

437
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:37,414
What hours of my life
could be worse.

438
00:59:37,797 --> 00:59:42,997
Even if you know me inside
my life has always been as history

439
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:46,071
who so neprosledima and unexpected.

440
00:59:48,066 --> 00:59:56,776
I was born on field they provide Peace on earth with rich fruit he had there.

441
00:59:57,189 --> 01:00:03,450
The nights were very pleasant, more than a maid. They were so energetic.

442
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:11,271
This is your land, your piece of land. Which was black, aside and cracked.

443
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:16,020
But here they are isolated in this torn
box that gave me.

444
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:21,897
Why did not they gave me one of the other. And no one was black and cracked.

445
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:28,844
It happened because before I was born

446
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:36,159
there were times of feudal lords, where we killed, early work season of field

447
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:42,392
and ripped them together through the ages, night after night.

448
01:00:42,835 --> 01:00:48,856
glitter of knives cut meat, again and again.

449
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:56,600
Until we meet Beautiful Christmas. and our proud parents

450
01:00:56,916 --> 01:01:01,966
We have shown impressive shining fields of blood.

451
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:07,115
Where were our hours treatment, they said.

452
01:01:07,427 --> 01:01:13,537
Then he gave the children of next hill, the next valley. Drive fast will tell you everything.

453
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:18,549
Others will give you what you want,
and I'll give it at any price.

454
01:01:18,829 --> 01:01:22,910
Fear not leave their choice
to being unfortunate.

455
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:37,650
So we had everything but it was complicated.

456
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,179
Curse from which we can not escape.

457
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:46,738
We need wretches, even if we do not get noticed.

458
01:01:47,527 --> 01:01:53,394
Spend your life doing what they do and others dig in mines, work in factories.

459
01:01:54,074 --> 01:01:57,827
If only one wretch,
if we pay well.

460
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:05,949
You can dress nice and to walk in good restaurants. even eat ice fish.

461
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:14,550
But we remember the manner in which abducted sisters of our land. Les Miserables and remember him too.

462
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:21,974
They still do not accept that we have our land. They think that we should change it.

463
01:02:22,516 --> 01:02:27,450
So we need to talk to Les Miserables

464
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:33,946
To talk and explain that This is not an option. They want things to be different want to change them.

465
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:40,351
And we must say 'yes', we also want this change. Change is good,

466
01:02:40,598 --> 01:02:48,727
but no violent change without murder. or want revenge, no.

467
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:56,889
Instead, listen to our idea for progressive change. The change will help will not hurt us.

468
01:02:57,611 --> 01:03:03,327
Morality, legality, progressive change.

469
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:08,898
We planned everything
a bilateral agreement

470
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:18,144
We give you things, many things but change must be considered. you are not entitled to take whatever you want.

471
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:23,420
You know what offer is: First, we offer much more everything

472
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:27,850
and then to convince everyone that
must use the new stuff.

473
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:35,510
This is reality. Now must wait

474
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:41,356
Otherwise we give you more now. new things before leaving themselves.

475
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:45,777
This I think we can lose.

476
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:51,111
Problem is that we know
Les Miserables

477
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:57,533
We know that they can not wait for that
panic, to prevent it.

478
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:05,745
Violence has increased in all. Teaching people that these things God gives them.

479
01:04:08,332 --> 01:04:12,506
World can not benefit from it. So,

480
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:19,818
We need to introduce special additional training for the poor wretches. to teach them the terrible Lessons from the past.

481
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:26,877
All these crimes caused by terrorists and rebels.

482
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:34,398
To teach people that they should never to try to see the power of the masses

483
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:41,822
rules because of the crowd not always competent and are always cruel.

484
01:04:42,531 --> 01:04:48,944
The crowd is bloodthirsty. Rejected, they have no skills

485
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:54,114
because it should never to happen .. They must understand that dreamer

486
01:04:54,739 --> 01:05:02,660
idealists, those who say that love Les Miserables. Always lead us to mass murder at the end

487
01:05:03,058 --> 01:05:09,240
Once you do something better,
no doubt you always doing something worse.

488
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:15,814
Promise to learn this lesson. The head of the secret

489
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:22,871
and even they do not understand. Brought them all out and shot.

490
01:05:24,598 --> 01:05:29,164
People are attacked by soldiers from police, they had to die.

491
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:37,700
Killings continued long, some of them sisters and brothers, already been killed,

492
01:05:37,997 --> 01:05:41,252
perhaps compassion or rage
but they do not feel so.

493
01:05:42,994 --> 01:05:49,565
To control these people, we must be as fathers. To tell them how to speak, how to look.

494
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:56,928
Sons to watch torture their parents and see how soldiers raped their children,

495
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:01,167
This is how to control
people who are not afraid of death.

496
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:10,248
And now I teach people that, will get things. but we will decide how you
give and when.

497
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:13,639
Because we do not believe you
give everything.

498
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:23,230
This can not be me. This is impossible.

499
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:31,465
My life was so beautiful. Everything was fine for me.

500
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:34,161
No.

501
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:41,281
No, this is wrong. Omitted to prevent it.

502
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:48,370
The old woman baking which You gave muffins, do you loved. not love as you think.

503
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:54,090
Trying to explain that People hate and try to explain why they hate people.

504
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:59,187
Why do you think they love. What used to love.

505
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,596
Who are you. Look a little.

506
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:11,450
Walk so stiffly each morning to the kitchen. Stand beside cabinet,

507
01:07:11,812 --> 01:07:19,488
open it and doing coffee which they expect to rouse. It must be there and if one morning not so.

508
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:27,281
And very crucial and unexpected and do not expect that evidence

509
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,702
pulling all too panic
breathing heavily.

510
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:38,506
Oh, where are you? Around the world have to pay.

511
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:45,188
Listening to the sound of his voice on the phone,
while talking about his life.

512
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:53,171
Oh no. Robin, Robin Robin. What do I need to go.
(What do I need to go ..)

513
01:07:53,513 --> 01:07:58,627
Most likely you need permission to go.
(Most likely you need permission to go.)

514
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:04,800
Understand their position. No place to live, no clothes to wear, free.

515
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:10,958
You will be like them. Homeless, restless

516
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:16,720
Of course, you know I will
do everything without limits.

517
01:08:18,274 --> 01:08:21,335
Sometimes I think about
suffering of the poor wretches.

518
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:26,524
Get in bed, feel like them, speak words of hope.

519
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:33,017
As new drugs are for your children. Soon the house.

520
01:08:33,857 --> 01:08:40,558
Cold world, cold people, as my neighbors will soon realize constructive change will happen.

521
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:45,703
But the spirit of the jury waiting and waiting
for a constructive change

522
01:08:46,116 --> 01:08:49,055
one by one they come to
knock on your door

523
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:56,042
Crying, they asked for help. New story on how to get from one to give to others.

524
01:08:57,769 --> 01:09:02,243
And to escape away from us bad neighborhoods, of infection from hell.

525
01:09:02,543 --> 01:09:09,517
Some of them are angry, other mad. and crimes which do fill each with great terror.

526
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:17,672
Some of them punished, in some countries, some of them execute them.

527
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:26,529
Someday I can control, to punish, to execute just you.

528
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:44,232
Justice is so for you because as much as you like these snow-white linen, music and dancers

529
01:09:45,309 --> 01:09:50,969
Because all the people who excited people
will be tortured tonight

530
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:54,333
who will be killed tonight.

531
01:09:59,774 --> 01:10:04,584
See? not fanaticism is so extreme

532
01:10:05,047 --> 01:10:09,262
no matter what evidence there is,
you need to see each person.

533
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:13,804
Your life is an example of how one takes
something from someone else.

534
01:10:14,195 --> 01:10:17,462
These people always want
to take something.

535
01:10:17,815 --> 01:10:21,179
And these people can not be
able to understand things.

536
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:26,859
This misunderstanding of the situation
is the lifestyles of all people.

537
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:34,999
So to say that you understand problem of how the world works and the base is not unfair.

538
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:40,771
Because you have to share
things you need

539
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:45,836
how inappropriate it is to share things
who have shared with you

540
01:10:46,528 --> 01:10:51,872
And all people like you who
need to share everything they have.

541
01:10:52,589 --> 01:10:59,590
This means that it is not inappropriate. And others that have to share the remnants.

542
01:11:01,242 --> 01:11:05,857
The way the world works
base is not unfair.

543
01:11:06,686 --> 01:11:14,155
You should find this. Top highest quality of this Man.

544
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:17,899
While the young woman
met in the church

545
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:22,672
falls into a desperate situation because
people who lost.

546
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,501
Employee who is it
tortured with a knife.

547
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:33,475
You must define it as the lowest
and very exceptionable example.

548
01:11:35,153 --> 01:11:37,498
who deserve punishment
by death.

549
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:49,993
Dear God, I understand

550
01:11:50,624 --> 01:11:56,302
What I, this will be continually outwit.

551
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:02,545
I lie for many things, many bad moments.

552
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:09,847
I wonder if I can not let your bird to live free lives.

553
01:12:11,233 --> 01:12:17,306
Go, try, let it happen.

554
01:12:18,424 --> 01:12:20,974
Say it, say it.

555
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:27,768
Life you lead is
hopelessly corrupted.

556
01:12:34,993 --> 01:12:37,130
It is not just effective

557
01:12:39,452 --> 01:12:43,388
My sympathy to the people does not change
people's lives.

558
01:12:45,938 --> 01:12:47,942
Constructive change has not happened.

559
01:12:53,314 --> 01:12:55,865
People's lives is
increasingly worse.

560
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:02,535
I am not better than
baker or chambermaid.

561
01:13:03,774 --> 01:13:06,932
So do not deserve more
of what they have.

562
01:13:11,481 --> 01:13:15,574
It is not an inevitable fate for me
have more.

563
01:13:17,032 --> 01:13:19,752
Money which have been part of me.

564
01:13:21,615 --> 01:13:26,461
I completely and easily separates them.

565
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:31,795
Keeping the money was
simple choice I made.

566
01:13:36,268 --> 01:13:40,774
I tried to split things with me
but they were always against the others.

567
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,837
I was alone against the crowd

568
01:13:49,327 --> 01:13:52,800
and perspective of one of
crowd

569
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,738
I'm the same.

570
01:14:02,558 --> 01:14:07,319
as my relatives. I'm exactly the same.

571
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:11,743
And I'm not covered,

572
01:14:14,026 --> 01:14:18,788
I could not do 2 choices. I could change their attitudes,

573
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,358
I could join
their understanding.

574
01:14:26,311 --> 01:14:28,898
Transmitted by loved ones,

575
01:14:31,449 --> 01:14:35,421
working in danger very difficult.

576
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:40,935
Choices if

577
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:45,069
I could not accept this fraudulent

578
01:14:47,766 --> 01:14:51,507
to accept this comfort.
Why not?

579
01:14:55,874 --> 01:14:57,874
Suffering close

580
01:15:02,852 --> 01:15:04,852
and evil.

581
01:15:36,982 --> 01:15:38,982
Fever broke.

582
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,120
I see it's dawn.

583
01:15:59,092 --> 01:16:06,622
Wondering what it is happened last night. may be a night in which prisoners
killed or executed.

584
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,898
Hours pass.

585
01:16:13,707 --> 01:16:16,780
others make them in the hallway
out of their tombs.

586
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:38,738
Streets awake, but I do not sleep.

587
01:16:46,094 --> 01:16:48,608
Next week I'll be home.

588
01:16:53,688 --> 01:16:59,623
You will sleep in his room, surrounded by my personal stuff

589
01:17:00,498 --> 01:17:05,392
my lamp, clock, books, gifts

590
01:17:06,209 --> 01:17:08,209
porcelain ballerina,

591
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:12,719
and there among them, from now on...

592
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:19,668
Let all those persons to sit on my bed.
