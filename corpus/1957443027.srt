183
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,743
<i>Yeah, and he sent the kid
to the hospital.</i>

184
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,544
<i>Amos is going to be expelled.</i>

185
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,612
<i>I think we should
just face up to that.</i>

186
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,447
He can't stay here...

187
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,182
What's he going to do?

188
00:13:43,244 --> 00:13:46,853
<i>You figure this one out.
He's your responsibility now.</i>

189
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,740
[Evelyn speaking Tagalog] I can't right now.
They need me here...

190
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,759
[woman] <i>It's time you told him</i>
<i>the truth, Evelyn.</i>

191
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,960
<i>Sorry, I have to go.</i>

192
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:57,730

193
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,031

[mailbox opens]

196
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,753
Hey, just give me a minute.
I'll get your mail.

197
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:22,020
[Evelyn] Thank you.

198
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,834
You out here staying
with the Regans for the winter?

199
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:41,173
Here. Mostly junk.

200
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,675
Thank you.

201
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,243
Um, the paper?

202
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,483
I almost missed you!

203
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,352
Rick, hey there!

204
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:56,021
- I hear Clem's back.
- [Susan] Yeah.

205
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,924
Come bother him sometime.

206
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:00,927
[car door closes]

207
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,997
[♪]

208
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:11,871
She fell last night.

209
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:18,610
You know, I thought
we were past that.

210
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:21,613
Yeah, it was quite a shock.

211
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:23,282
I guess we have to start
locking up again.

212
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,718
Once, we found her
down here by the ponds.

213
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:28,620
She only has a bruise.
Nothing's broken.

214
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:35,895
[inhales deeply]
Are you settling in okay?

215
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,097
Yes. The quiet has been
very, very nice.

216
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,236
The irony is,
with all Clem's insisting

217
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,873
that Mom wants to die at home,

218
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,642
I'm pretty sure she never
actually wanted to live out here.

219
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,778
It was Dad
who liked the isolation.

220
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:58,417
Speaking of, looks like I need
to make Clemy give him a mow.

221
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,520
[Evelyn]
That's where he's buried?

222
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,823
[Susan]
Yeah, he and my uncle.

223
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,026
But it's actually
just the marker right now.

224
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,828
The morgue transferred him
to the wrong place

225
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,195
and he got lost.

226
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:11,864
Can you believe that?

227
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:14,834
[laughing] That's... I mean,
it's absurd, right?

228
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,803
[laughs] Come on.

229
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:23,275
Hmm. Well, besides the fall,
is she behaving herself?

230
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:27,346
Yes. It's been lovely
getting to know your mother.

231
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:31,516
Okay. And with my brother?

232
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,454
I don't see him much, so...

233
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:38,190
- You probably won't.
- Hmm.

234
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:41,060
You should have seen the way the two of
them were living before you got here.

235
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:43,128
The house was disgusting.

236
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,233
Clem and my mom
have a special understanding.

237
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,403
[♪]

238
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,039
[wind chime tinkling]

239
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:56,876
- [car doors open and close]
- [quiet chatter]

240
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:02,081
- [bird screeching]
- [Susan] You can't get up, Mom.

241
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,217
If you want to get out of bed,
Evelyn has to help you.

242
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,320
Okay?
Mom, that's why she's here.

243
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:13,660
[bird screeching]

244
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,802
Are you picking me up?

245
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,837
[Susan]
Are you listening, Mom?

246
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:27,305
You can't fall again.
It's very dangerous.

247
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,742
[bird screeching]

248
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,478
You're on Warfarin.

249
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:35,815
Your blood is very thin.

250
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,349
If you fall and cut yourself,

251
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,217
we won't be able to stop
the bleeding.

252
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,755
Blood thinners, Mom.

253
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:44,489
It could be very bad.

254
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,530
Has she been this bad all week?

255
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,701
Mom?

256
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,569
Mom?

257
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,508
Do you understand me?

258
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:06,344
Mom?

259
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:10,983
This is different.

260
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,885
[laughs]

261
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,352
There she is.

262
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,125
Can we get her up?

263
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:21,661
You want your chair, Dena?

264
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:23,162
No? Okay.

265
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:25,530
[Clem] What are y'all
doing to her now?

266
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,332
- Help, then.
- [bird screeching]

267
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,901
[Dena]
Hush, Pepper!

268
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:31,236
- Hey, sister.
- She fell.

269
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:34,140
- She was night wandering.
- [bird screeching]

270
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,474
Oh, yeah?

271
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:44,516
- [screeching continues]
- Shh, shh, shh, shh...

272
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,918
[Dena]
Clem, where were you?

273
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,186
Shh, shh, shh...

274
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,489
Clem! Where were you?

275
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,597
Mama, you can't get up.

276
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,900
You know that.
You know better.

277
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,772
There was a boy
in your room.

278
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,173
Oh, yeah?

279
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,675
He was colored.

280
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,445
[scoffs]

281
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,948
That's Evelyn's nephew, Mama.
He's visiting.

282
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:23,288
Well, th... someone
is takin' my things, Clem.

283
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:27,026
- They took my charivari.
- [Susan] Mom, are you listening? This is really important.

284
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,394
[Dena] It is important.
They took my charivari.

285
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:33,398
- I told him.
- [Susan] I cannot be driving back and forth to Houston...

286
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:36,468
[conversation continues
indistinctly]

287
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:49,148
What's up?

288
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,020
Just a little dizzy.

289
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:57,522
You went on another run?

290
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,628
What else am I supposed to do?

291
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:07,532
You have to eat.

292
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:10,903
I don't like that stuff.

293
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,806
I'll make you something else.

294
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,314
Mom say anything about school?

295
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:29,255
[Evelyn] They said to stay on top of
your workbooks so you don't fall behind.

296
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,429
Yeah.

297
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,234

[bird cawing]

299
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,842
When that's up, the doors lock
automatically, both inside and out.

300
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,477
That's this for the front and
back, and this goes to the garage,

301
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,546
and this opens
all the doors upstairs.

302
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,351
Clem's got copies of these,
and you can make copies of these.

303
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,553
- [Evelyn] <i>Okay.</i>
- [Susan] <i>Keep all the doors closed.</i>

304
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,724
<i>And wherever you don't want the
old broad needs to be locked.</i>

305
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:08,160
<i>Keep it locked, lock it behind
you, especially at night,</i>

306
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:10,329
<i>when the sundowning's
getting bad, okay?</i>

307
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:11,764
[Evelyn] <i>Okay.</i>

308
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,468
- [smoke detector chirps]
- [Dena, faintly] No.

309
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,071
I'm scared, Clem.

310
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:22,507
I'm scared all the time.

311
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,877
I wish you hadn't told me.

312
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:30,049

Did you say something, Dena?

00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:37,843
Where did Clem go?

337
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:41,013
I don't know.

Did you need anything?

341
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:56,429
I'm fine, dear.

342
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,405
I'll just get the mail, then.

- [Rick] How they doin'?
- [car door closes]

346
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:33,933
- [Evelyn] Excuse me?
- The Regans.

347
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:37,269
Oh! Oh, very well, thank you.

348
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:41,707
You better tell Clem he better call
some of his high school buddies.

349
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,810
We're starting to think he's getting
a little high opinion of himself.

350
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:52,084
[Evelyn] Uh, I don't think
this belongs to us.

351
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:56,155
Say, do you know
this gentleman?

352
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:59,525
I swear I've never seen
another Asian around here,

353
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,961
but he gets mail
from time to time.

354
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,529
Have a good weekend.

355
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:07,166
[Rick] Hey, wait!

356
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:10,836

535
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:48,974
I couldn't leave the States,

536
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:54,747
so my sister and I,
we paid for a nice funeral.

537
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,217
[sighs deeply]

538
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,088
Dena...

539
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:08,828
who are you talking to at night?

540
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:13,432
What?

541
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:15,401
The other night,
when I came in,

542
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:18,437
you were talking about a man
and you were very upset.

543
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:22,441
Here?

544
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:27,446
I was?

545
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:31,717
Oh! [laughs]

546
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,287
Oh, dear!
[laughs]

547
00:41:37,923 --> 00:41:39,959
[leaves rustling]

548
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:46,298
[exhales deeply]

549
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,541
[grunts]

550
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:57,810
[static crackling
over intercom]

551
00:41:57,843 --> 00:41:59,578
[crickets chirping]

552
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:02,356
[woman speaking Tagalog]
What are you up to, Mr. Sanzaru?

553
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:06,285
[suspenseful music]

554
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,999
[thumping]

555
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,631
[woman speaking Tagalog]
Do what you want with your people...

556
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:29,925
But...

557
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,053
Let mine leave first.

558
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:40,519
[chatter on TV]

559
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:47,459
[line ringing]

560
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:51,665
- [automated voice] <i>You have reached the voice mailbox of...</i>
- [Anita] <i>Anita Santos.</i>

561
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:54,200
[automated voice] <i>To leave
a voice message, press 1,</i>

562
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:57,002
- <i>or just wait for the tone.</i>
- [beeps]

563
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,747
[speaking Tagalog]
Sister, it's me again...

564
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:05,085
Please call back...

565
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,883
I can't think...

566
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:17,223
Um... [clears throat]

567
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:19,057
What does...

568
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:25,439
What does Amos know?

569
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,798
He won't look me in the eyes anymore...

570
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:29,568
- [beeps]
- [phone and power turn off]

571
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:30,803
[Dena groans]

572
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:32,771
Clem?

573
00:43:39,713 --> 00:43:41,146
Patched the tire.

574
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:43,349
Should last a while now.

575
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:45,517
- [tap running]
- The power's out again.

576
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:47,219
[Clem]
It's not the breaker.

577
00:43:54,026 --> 00:43:55,494
Try some sugar.

578
00:44:12,378 --> 00:44:15,414
[♪]

579
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:21,120
Thanks.

580
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:28,827
I was thinking about...

581
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:32,097
maybe taking Amos
out on the boat.

582
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:36,201
I... I thought you were
gonna go to town.

583
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:37,771
I made you a list.

584
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:42,975
We can go tomorrow.

585
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:45,477
No, I would rather
he finish his schoolwork.

586
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,651
[sighs] Yeah.

587
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:52,985
You know...

588
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:56,889
I'd check in on that
if I was you.

589
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,061
I'm gonna go see
about the power.

590
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:05,799
[muffled thudding]

591
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,867
[chatter on TV]

592
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:25,551
You haven't done any of these.

593
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:27,853
None.

594
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:34,026
So? [sighs]

595
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:35,461
It doesn't matter.

596
00:45:35,494 --> 00:45:37,429
Maybe you just want to be dumb.

597
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:43,235
- Maybe you just are dumb.
- Do you think anybody gives a shit if I do any of this?

598
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:46,338
They don't.

599
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:50,710
I can't pretend to do that.

600
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:57,784
[clattering]

601
00:45:57,817 --> 00:46:00,285
I know you're not my aunt.

602
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,355
[suspenseful music]

603
00:46:05,924 --> 00:46:07,960
[sniffling]

604
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:13,899
[muted chatter]

605
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:20,874

606
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:46,098
[suspenseful music continues]

[knife chopping]

608
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:21,467
What's that?

609
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:25,103
It's dinner.

610
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:29,041
Can I help with anything?

611
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:30,677
You can have a seat.

612
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,248
You want some coffee
or somethin'?

613
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,050
Coffee would be good.

614
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,854
- Uh, no, you don't have to do...
- Don't worry about it.

615
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:44,623
[coffee pouring]

616
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:50,162
How's your head?

617
00:47:51,798 --> 00:47:54,901
Still... [sighs]

618
00:47:55,935 --> 00:47:57,369
fuzzy.

619
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,915
[knife chopping]

620
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:16,756
[flatware clattering]

621
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:28,133
[Clem]
What, you don't like it?

622
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,502
He doesn't like fish.

623
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:31,905
I do.

624
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:35,675
[sighing] Hmm.

625
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,713
I suppose you like it better with
all the chemicals they put in it

626
00:48:40,747 --> 00:48:42,581
from the supermarket.

627
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:47,319
Yeah, they want you to get
used to the taste of chemicals,

628
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:50,122
so you forget
what real meat tastes like.

629
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:52,124
- That's not true.
- That's a true story.

630
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:54,226
- Hmm-mm.
- Did you know they pump

631
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:57,563
supermarket meats
full of carbon monoxide?

632
00:48:58,497 --> 00:48:59,766
It's true.

633
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,969
Keeps it all red.

634
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:04,202
[chuckles]

635
00:49:05,772 --> 00:49:09,241
Real meats turn brown,
you let 'em sit out for too long.

636
00:49:12,444 --> 00:49:13,680
[imitates water drip]

637
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:16,515

[Dena groans]

642
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:39,005
- Oh, my God.
- [Dena grunts]

643
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:43,676
Dena, what are you doing?

644
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,845
Holy shit, Mama!

645
00:49:45,878 --> 00:49:47,512
Dena, can you hear me?

646
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:50,083
- We have to sit you down.
- I can hear him.

647
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:51,851
We're right here, Dena.
Let's sit you down.

648
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:54,252
[Dena]
I can hear him.

649
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:55,888
[Clem]
Where's that coming from?

650
00:49:55,922 --> 00:49:57,356
Shit!

651
00:49:57,389 --> 00:50:00,626
Moe, get my kit by the bed.
Now!

652
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,062
I'm right here, Dena.

653
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:04,463
It's the blood thinners.

654
00:50:04,496 --> 00:50:06,331
We have to clot
the bleeding now.

655
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:12,604
[groans] I can still hear him
in the walls, Clemy.

656
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:15,540
- Mama, you gotta relax.
- Go check the top left drawer.

657
00:50:15,574 --> 00:50:18,143
Hold this. [panting]

658
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:20,947
Top, top left.

659
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:24,483
I don't want this anymore.

660
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:27,619
[Evelyn panting]

661
00:50:27,654 --> 00:50:29,621
[water running]

662
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:38,798
[Clem]
<i>She make you afraid of dyin'?</i>

663
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,914
But I have a faith
that guides me.

664
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,718
What about you?

665
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:02,554
[sighs]

666
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,326
Waitin' for her to die
has been somethin' horrific.

667
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:14,701
But, nah, I ain't afraid
of anything anymore.

668
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:19,404
Anymore?

669
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:45,198
I hope it's okay to ask
about your father.

670
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:49,601
When did he pass away?

671
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:53,940
I'm sorry to ask.

672
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:59,045
I feel like I should know.
Dena doesn't say anything.

673
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:01,080
Maybe she doesn't want to.

674
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:06,485
I'm sorry.

675
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:08,821
[exhales]

676
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:13,625
[sighs deeply]

00:52:20,032 --> 00:52:23,069

[rain pattering]

682
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:55,835
Hi.

683
00:53:00,605 --> 00:53:01,774
Hi.

684
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:08,380
Come in.

685
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,457
[Clem]
Here, have a seat...

686
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:21,027
if you like.

687
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:54,727
You know, I just got back
from Afghanistan.

688
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,699
I... I didn't know.

689
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:07,572
There was this kid there
with us, didn't quite fit in.

690
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:12,211
Had narcolepsy.

691
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:16,182
Maybe he's a little off,
you know.

692
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,551
- He would fall asleep?
- Yeah.

693
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:21,754
Yeah.

694
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:26,192
So, you ever met
a narcoleptic dog before?

695
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:29,061
No. Is it a joke?

696
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:30,363
No.

697
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,398
I had this dog
when I was a kid.

698
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:36,401
She was narcoleptic.
She'd fall asleep all the time.

699
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:40,538
You throw a ball for her,
and she'd be runnin' hard after it,

700
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,540
tail waggin', all happy...

701
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:45,745
[laughs] then she'd just
fall over sideways, snorin'.

702
00:54:45,778 --> 00:54:49,414
- [mock snoring, laughs]
- [chuckles]

703
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,227
Our unit didn't treat him
too good.

704
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:10,836
That kid
I was tellin' you about.

705
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:14,240
Oh, right.

706
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:15,675
What happened?

707
00:55:17,977 --> 00:55:20,780
One night,
things got out of hand.

708
00:55:20,813 --> 00:55:22,514
He got beat up pretty bad.

709
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:29,121
Few of the others,
they... took advantage.

710
00:55:32,758 --> 00:55:35,061
Officer asked me what happened.

711
00:55:35,094 --> 00:55:36,162
I...

712
00:55:36,963 --> 00:55:38,596
I didn't say a thing.

713
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,435
Not one word.

714
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,807

Why won't you listen?

01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:47,913
[dramatic music]

900
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,956
[panting]

901
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:11,036
Dena, get up.

902
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:14,741
Dena?
We have to get up.

903
01:20:14,774 --> 01:20:17,710
- I have to get you... I can't carry you.
- [Dena] Oh, Clem.

904
01:20:17,744 --> 01:20:21,113
No, no.
We'll come back for him.

905
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:24,116
Oh... Oh, Clem.

[heart beating faintly]

909
01:21:34,654 --> 01:21:36,923
Why did you take
the blood thinners?

910
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,362
Huh?

911
01:21:44,697 --> 01:21:45,732
Why?

912
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:54,506
I'll send somebody.

913
01:21:57,476 --> 01:21:59,111

01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:22,635
I'm sorry.

917
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,974
[crying] I'm sorry.

918
01:23:23,896 --> 01:23:25,932

[woman speaking Tagalog]
They say I can go now...

921
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:10,634
But everything's clear now,
Mr. Sanzaru...

922
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:21,687
Your people won't let you go...

923
01:24:25,825 --> 01:24:29,261

- [wings fluttering]

924
