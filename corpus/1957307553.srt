- Oh, I'm sure
they'll be here soon,

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,700
let's grab a seat, these two.

34
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,066
- Maggie, over here.
- Oh, there's Ginny.

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry, thank you
for saving us seats.

36
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,767
- I've been here since 2:00 PM,

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,433
it seems like just yesterday
it was you up on that stage,

38
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,333
rocking out in your Santa hat.

39
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,367
- Oh, those little
antlers she wore,

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,900
the year you played Prancer.

41
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,367
- Mom, that was like
a million years ago,

42
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,033
oh, Kate's here,
can I go say hi?

43
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:09,767
- Sure.

44
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm just gonna save you a seat.

45
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,000
- Hi.

46
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,533
- So, this is Jeff's new
girlfriend, do we like her?

47
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,000
- She's like a walking
Instagram post,

48
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,200
it's a little unnerving,

49
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,567
I mean her clothes
never wrinkle.

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
- I see that.

51
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,900
- How do you think she does
that, portable steamer?

52
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,900
- Does she have
children of her own?

53
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,266
- No.
- Mystery solved.

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,533
- Excuse me, are you
saving that seat?

55
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,800
No, it's all you.
- Thank you.

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,367
(gentle music)

57
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,934
- That was so cute.
- We'll talk.

58
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,433
- Yes, call me later.

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,033
- Oh hey, Maggie, over here.

60
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,166
- I'm okay.

61
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,233
- Okay, nothing
to see here folks,

62
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,400
happy holidays,
happens all the time.

63
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,400
- Oh, you stepped on
my "(indistinct) wow.

64
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,600
- Oh, my goodness
are you all right?

65
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,900
- Yes, I'm fine.

66
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,066
- Maggie, isn't what
you'd call coordinated.

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,066
- Mom falls all the time.

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,567
- Remember that time you
tripped on the sidewalk

69
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,433
and the cookie tins went flying?

70
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,300
- To be fair it was icy and
the pavement was very uneven.

71
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,133
- Thank you.
- She spills stuff too.

72
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,300
- Okay, enough about me,

73
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,967
Sophie, honey you were
incredible up there,

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,834
I have never seen
an elf so poised.

75
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,333
- Look at the
flowers Kate got me.

76
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,266
- Oh wow, they're gorgeous.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,066
- It is not every
day that I get,

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,734
a personal invitation
to a concert

79
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,867
and from one of the
performers herself.

80
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,233
- There's cocoa at the snack
table, can we go get some.

81
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,800
- Hey, don't look at me
your mom's on the clock.

82
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,467
- Yeah, go ahead.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,567
- Do you want me to take this?

84
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,667
- Hey, one cookie each.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,233
Oh, I spoke to the
airline this morning.

86
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,967
- Again?
- Jeff.

87
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,133
The girls have never flown alone

88
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,700
and Maggie's a little nervous.

89
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,734
- Oh, oh, there's
no need to worry,

90
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,800
I flew unaccompanied at
all the time as a kid,

91
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,700
the flight attendants
totally dote on you.

92
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,967
- See, they'll be fine and
this gives me a chance,

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,033
to fly up a little early

94
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,800
and spend some quality
time with Kate's dad.

95
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:29,300
- I booked a his and
his dog sledding lesson.

96
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:30,567
- How fun is that?

97
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,233
- We are so excited to
have Mia and Sophie,

98
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:33,500
joining us for Christmas.

99
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,967
- Oh, I'm really
glad it worked out,

100
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,033
even though I'm gonna
miss them like crazy.

101
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,133
- Should we set up a time
for you guys to Zoom?

102
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,200
- How do you guys like to
work things over the holidays?

103
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:49,367
- I don't know we've
never actually been
apart on Christmas.

104
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
- You haven't?

105
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,300
- Well, I usually bring
the girls to my sister's

106
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,667
for Christmas Eve and then we
go to Maggie's in the morning

107
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
and we open up
presents together.

108
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,700
- Oh, and then we hit the
blow ups on Christol street.

109
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,367
- There's a radiologist
in Maggie's neighborhood

110
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,233
and he's got like a
hundred different blowups

111
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,800
on his front lawn, it's insane,

112
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,767
we have to drive by
there this weekend.

113
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,133
- Okay, well let's just back
up a sec, I had no idea,

114
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,200
that you've never been apart
from the girls on Christmas,

115
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,233
okay, this is gonna sound crazy

116
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,233
but why don't you
come to Aspen too.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,767
- Oh no, I couldn't possibly.

118
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,633
- You know that way
you won't miss a thing

119
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,300
and it is so magical up
there this time of year,

120
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,200
you're gonna love it.

121
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,100
- That is a very sweet offer
honey but it's peak ski season,

122
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,266
I'm sure all the hotels
are booked up by now.

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,467
- Oh, no, now you can stay
with us at my parents' place,

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
it'll be cozy.

125
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,367
- Wait, mom's coming to Aspen?

126
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,033
- You are?

127
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,200
- We're just discussing it
bug, it's not a done deal.

128
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,433
- Please come mommy, please,

129
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,600
Christmas won't be
Christmas without you.

130
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:53,133
- Oh, come on, how can
you say no to that?

131
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,300
- If you insist.

132
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,233
Thank you.

133
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,500
(cheerful music)

134
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,033
Our Uber driver Karli C
is arriving in 15 minutes.

135
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:16,033
- Miss Collins, Miss
Collins, Miss Collins, wait.

136
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,467
- Sophie and keep your eyes
peeled for carousels too.

137
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,800
- Mom, I think he's
talking about you.

138
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:24,100
- You three are pretty fast,

139
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,266
you must be Sophie
and Mia, right?

140
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,300
- That's us, who are you?

141
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,633
- I'm Hector Shetty,

142
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,266
I manage the Reynolds
family's Aspen estate.

143
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,367
- Estate?

144
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,800
- Kate, asked me to pick you up.

145
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,200
- Mr Shetty, what's an estate?

146
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,200
- Kind of like a
fancy word for house.

147
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,700
- A huge house, way
bigger than ours?

148
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:43,467
- Mia.

149
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,133
- What isn't that what it means?

150
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,700
- Well, if you guys
wanna follow me,

151
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,967
we'll collect your
bags and be on our way.

152
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,700
- Come on, let's go.

153
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:53,533
- Estate.

154
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,367
(cheerful music)

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
- It's like we're
inside a snow globe.

156
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,200
- Well, if you think
that's magical,

157
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,066
you should see main street,

158
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,934
when it's all lit up
for Christmas, it's
really something.

159
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,567
- [Sophie] Are we
climbing a mountain?

160
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
- We sure are.

161
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,867
- Is that the estate?
- It sure is.

162
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:19,800
Here we are.

163
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,400
- Welcome to Aspen,
how was the trip?

164
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,400
- We got to drink
soda on the plane.

165
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:31,266
- Whoa, what you lucky ducks,

166
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,867
here let me help you with those.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,066
- It's okay we'll
take care of it.

168
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,133
- Oh, thank you.

169
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:39,667
- So, girls, there is cocoa
inside if that's okay.

170
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,433
- They're on your clock now,

171
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,266
just don't feed
them after midnight.

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,266
- You know what happens
if you break the rule.

173
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,667
- [Maggie And Jeff] You
haven't seen Gremlins?

174
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,266
- It's the greatest
Christmas movie of all time,

175
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,767
that is going on the list.

176
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,767
We have a Venn diagram going
of all the movies we've seen

177
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
and the overlap is
alarmingly small.

178
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:05,600
- And yet you seem so
happy, look at you, glowing.

179
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,567
- Get outta here, hey,
hey, hey before we go in,

180
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,934
I could really use
one of your pep talks,

181
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,800
turns out Kate's dad
isn't my biggest fan.

182
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,734
- I thought you two
were best buddies,

183
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:20,300
I mean, you never took
my dog, dog sledding,

184
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,633
I got to say I'm a bit jealous.

185
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,667
- Don't be, it was
a total disaster.

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,533
- What'd you do let
go of the reins?

187
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,300
You didn't.

188
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,800
- They were huskies they
took off like a shot.

189
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,100
Do you know how hard
it is trying to find,

190
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,433
a white dog in the snow?

191
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,300
And now you're here
and don't get me wrong,

192
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:42,433
I'm glad you came but it
is a little awkward right,

193
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,033
you being here?

194
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,533
- It is now.

195
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,300
Thank you.
- You know, what,

196
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,967
I didn't say anything,

197
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,400
let's forget about it, I'm
probably overthinking it.

198
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,100
- Yeah, what else is new?

199
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,000
- Touche.

200
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:57,500
- Can we please go inside now

201
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,500
because my eyelashes
are freezing together.

202
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,266
Holy guacamole.
- Be cool.

203
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,800
- This place is gigantic,

204
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:17,500
you didn't mention
anything about an estate.

205
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,700
- Well, I thought it'd
be a fun surprise.

206
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,734
- Maggie, this is my father.

207
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,233
- Ted Reynolds, it's a pleasure.

208
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,734
- Thank you so much for letting
me crash your Christmas,

209
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,300
your home is stunning.

210
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,533
- I'd give you the 50 cent tour

211
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,233
but I'm on my way
to see a patient,

212
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,867
so, Kate will show you around
and get you settled in,

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,066
I'll see you later sweetheart.

214
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,867
Hello, Jeff.
- See ya doc.

215
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:43,533
- Oh wow, these
ornaments are gorgeous,

216
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,300
are they family heirlooms?

217
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:48,533
- My stepmother's decorator
had them flown in from Venice,

218
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:52,900
they're hand-blown and
apparently quite fragile,

219
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,567
so, let's all steer clear,

220
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,934
Susan's a little
particular about the trees.

221
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,400
- How many are there?

222
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:03,166
- Too many to count and
each one has its own theme.

223
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,333
- No wrapping paper
ornaments here.

224
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:07,300
- Oh, is that like
a TikTok thing?

225
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,800
- It's more like a
family tradition,

226
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,800
on Christmas day we gather up
all the torn wrapping paper

227
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,834
and use it to make an
ornament, decoupage style.

228
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,834
- I make one every year.

229
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,734
- Well, ever since Mia was two,

230
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:22,400
back then she liked the gift
wrap more than the toys.

231
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,467
- She was so cute running around

232
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,900
with her chubby little hands
grabbing up fistfuls of paper.

233
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,500
- Mom stop.

234
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,800
- Well, I think that is just
about the sweetest thing,

235
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,066
that I've heard.

236
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,900
- Well, I can show
you how to make one.

237
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,400
- Girls, Kate has all sorts
of special things lined up

238
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,300
for Christmas the
whole week in fact.

239
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,400
- We're gonna have
the best time,

240
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,000
how about I show you around?

241
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,433
- Yeah, where's the closet?

242
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,900
- That view is spectacular.

243
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:55,066
- It is nicer than any
hotel I have ever stayed in.

244
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
- And that's a problem because?

245
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,633
- It's not it's just Jeff's
acting kind of weird,

246
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,934
it's like he's worried,

247
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,567
I'm gonna make him
look bad or something.

248
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,467
- Well, it's bound to get
awkward at some point,

249
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,533
I mean, you are
spending Christmas

250
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,100
with your ex-husband's
new girlfriend's parents.

251
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,033
- You should see the
rest of the house,

252
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,900
there is a sauna in my
room an actual sauna,

253
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,367
there's an indoor racquetball
court, a private chef.

254
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,767
- Well, that sounds awful.

255
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,433
- I just wished Jeff
would've given me,

256
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,934
the heads up about
Kate's family,

257
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,867
so, I could have been
mentally prepared.

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,700
- Is Mia still getting
her big surprise?

259
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:29,066
- Yes, I cannot wait to
see the look on Mia's face,

260
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,367
when she opens these earrings.

261
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,400
- Well, how are you
gonna pull that one off?

262
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:37,633
- I found a tattoo parlor
in Aspen that does piercings

263
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,066
and I booked her an
appointment for the 26th,

264
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,633
who's the cool mom now?

265
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,934
- This isn't about Kate, is it?

266
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:48,467
- What, no, please,
okay, maybe a little,

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,633
you should see this
itinerary she made,

268
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,567
there is a Nutcracker tea
party at the St. Mark's hotel,

269
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,633
caroling by horse-drawn sleigh,
I can't compete with it.

270
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,300
- You don't have to
compete, you're the mom,

271
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,533
you are a Christmas.

272
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,200
Look do yourself a favor
okay, hop in that sauna

273
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,667

(Sam claps)

290
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
- Didn't realize my room
came with a floor show,

291
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,300
do you take requests?

292
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,633
- No and this is my room.

293
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,700
- Says who?

294
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,934
- Dr. Ted Reynolds, the
owner of this estate

295
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,066
- Oh, fascinating,
tell me something,

296
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,066
does the sauna still
go tik tik tik?

297
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,367
- I didn't notice.

298
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,533
- I can hop in there test
it out, care to join me?

299
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,667
- Excuse me, no not happening,

300
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,066
obviously there has
been a mix up here.

301
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,734
- Oh, maybe it's fate,
I mean two strangers,

302
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,600
sharing a room at Christmas?

303
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,467
- Who are you?

304
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,367
- I'm Sam Reynolds, Ted's son,

305
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,600
this is my childhood bedroom
and that that's my robe.

306
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,300
- Great.

307
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,934
- Let me be the first to
apologize on Sam's behalf,

308
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,667
just because he's super
charming and handsome

309
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,700
and an amazing chef,

310
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,767
doesn't mean he can do
whatever he pleases,

311
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,433
if I showed up at a
fully booked restaurant,

312
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,934
without a reservation do you
think that they would give me,

313
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,233
the best seat in the house?

314
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,567
- Oh, they would
if I worked there,

315
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,033
anything for you little sis.

316
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,667
- I've readied the downstairs
guest room for Sam.

317
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,700
- I am more than happy to switch
rooms I've barely unpacked.

318
00:13:58,834 --> 00:13:59,667
- Sounds good to me.

319
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,900
- Where's your sense
of hospitality son?

320
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,100
Maggie is a guest.

321
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,667
- I fly in from Tokyo
to surprise you,

322
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,567
I thought that would get me,
I don't know a hug, a steak,

323
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,266
ability to sleep in my own bed.

324
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,133
- Okay, here's a hug, Josie,
can you fix this boy a rib-eye,

325
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,934
you gonna have to settle
for two out of three.

326
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,567
- Hello, everyone,
so sorry I am late,

327
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
there was a crazy line at
the bell mountain lift.

328
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:25,600
- You must be Maggie,
I am Susan, Ted's wife,

329
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,433
it's so, nice to meet you.

330
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,433
- Sam, what are you doing here?

331
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,834
I thought you were staying
in Japan for the holidays.

332
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,467
- We all did.

333
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,533
- Well not everyone plans
as far ahead as you Kit Kat.

334
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,767
- Well, not everyone shows
up at the last minute

335
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
and expects the world
to revolve around him.

336
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,467
- So, Maggie, Kate, tells me,

337
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,967
that you run your own graphic
design business in Austin?

338
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,433
- I do it's mostly
branding campaigns,

339
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,000
websites, logos, pitch
decks, that kind of thing.

340
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,667
- Maggie is being modest
she's incredibly talented.

341
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,166
- Yes, you should see
the adorable poster,

342
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,500
she designed for
Sophie's school concert.

343
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:01,533
- Well that, that was more
of a volunteer project,

344
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,500
I usually work with ad
agencies and corporate clients.

345
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:06,667
- Well, I'm sure
you're ready for some,

346
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,367
well-deserved downtime.

347
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,367
- Oh, did you know your
room has a sauna in it?

348
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,367
- Oh, she knows.

349
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,400
- View is the same
inside you know

350
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,300
and they have this
thing called heat.

351
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:29,033
- Yes but out here
I can be alone.

352
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,900
- I have a proposition for you.

353
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,500
- If you think I'm gonna
serenade you again,

354
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:36,800
you are sorely mistaken.

355
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,867
- No, this is work-related,

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,633
I have a meeting in
Aspen on Christmas Eve

357
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,367
and I wanna hire you to
make me a pitch deck.

358
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,000
- So, all that talk back there
about flying in from Japan,

359
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,367
to surprise your family
that was all an act?

360
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,867
- Can't it be both?

361
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,133
Come on, this meeting

362
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,400
is a once in a lifetime
opportunity for me,

363
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,700
I'd be happy to
double your rate.

364
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,133
- You've never
even seen my work.

365
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,633
- Yeah, I googled you just now,

366
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,533
the portfolio was
very impressive.

367
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,033
- I am flattered but
unfortunately the answer is no,

368
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,266
I am here to spend
time with my girls.

369
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,934
- Have you seen my
sister's itinerary?

370
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,934
- Your kid's are gonna be
so knee-deep in Christmas,

371
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,734
they're not even gonna miss you.

372
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:19,100
Oh, you're worried
they're not gonna miss you

373
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,367
because they'll be having
so much fun with Kate?

374
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,800
- The girls and I have
our own traditions,

375
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,767
I am sure there will be
plenty of time for everything,

376
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
now, if you'll excuse me.

377
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:31,367
- I'll tell you what
you make me a deck

378
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,734
and I'll help you win Christmas,

379
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,266
you know, you scratch my
back, I scratch yours.

380
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,767
- I didn't come all this
way to get my back scratched

381
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,467
and for your information I
don't need to win Christmas,

382
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,834
I'm their mom, I am Christmas.

383
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,000
- I'll be here all week
if you change your mind.

384
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,433
- [Sam] All the big
ones are for me.

385
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,667
- We're decorating
Christmas cookies tonight,

386
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,667
it's on the itinerary.

387
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,000
- Oh, well look at
you Fancy Nancy.

388
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,100
- Maggie, come join us.

389
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:17,800
- Oh, sure.

390
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,100
- Oh, are those stockings?

391
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:26,800
- Yes, we always hang ours
the day after Thanksgiving

392
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,967
but I know some
families like to wait,

393
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,667
until everyone's all together.

394
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,567
- Actually Kate had some
stockings made for the girls.

395
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,667
- We didn't realize that
you'd be bringing yours along,

396
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,967
there is this fabulous
artist in Santa Fe,

397
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,100
who makes hand quilted
stockings from vintage fabrics,

398
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,767
I had one made for you
too, it took some doing.

399
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,100
- Normally you have to
order the months in advance,

400
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,066
but Kate turned on the charm

401
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,133
and wouldn't take
no for an answer.

402
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,633
- Wow, that is so thoughtful.

403
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:57,767
- One way to put it.

404
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,166
- Did you know Sam and
Kate's great-grandfather,

405
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,400
opened one of the
very first ski lodges

406
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,367
in the whole Aspen area?

407
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,266
- The Butterfield Inn,

408
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,867
we used to spend
Christmases there as kids

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,533
- Back before Dad
sold the place.

410
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,934
- Who needs a refill?

411
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,166
- Oh, Jeff and I
will take care of it,

412
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,033
you sit down and relax.

413
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:22,900
- Don't be stingy.

414
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,166
- Hey I haven't
bombed that hard,

415
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,533
since I recited the
Gettysburg address

416
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,200
at my 10th grade talent show.

417
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
- What are you talking
about, the stockings?

418
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,500
Don't worry about it,

419
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:35,700
there's like eight
fireplaces in this place,

420
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:36,834
we can hang all of them.

421
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,400
- Now, Maggie's offended

422
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:42,066
and I wanted everything
to be perfect.

423
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,533
- It will be and the fact,

424
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,000
that you're always
thinking of Mia and Sophie,

425
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,400
it's one of my favorite
things about you,

426
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:52,967
how about later you recite
that Gettysburg address for me,

427
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,533
Madam president?

428
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,734
Yeah, can you do a little Abe
Lincoln impression for me?

429
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,166
(indistinct)

430
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,233
- Oh, I think my
dad is watching.

431
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,100
- Yeah, he wants a scotch,
coming right up Ted.

432
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,033
- [Jeff] Hey, why don't
you sit next to Ted,

433
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,600
Ted, we're gonna join you.

434
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:09,767
- Did you bring this wine?

435
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,400
- I did, the Karl franc.

436
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,734
- So Maggie, what's on
tab tomorrow morning,

437
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,433
skiing, snowboarding?

438
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,033
- I'm sorry just the
thought of Maggie on skis.

439
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,433
- I think what Jeff's trying
to say is I'm a bit of a klutz.

440
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,400
- She falls all the time.

441
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,200
- Jeff has always
been the skier,

442
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,767
I'm more of a sit by the
fire and read kind of girl.

443
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,100
- So, where did you
two meet Tinder, Hinge,

444
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,066
wait, let me guess Bumble?

445
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
- No, no, no, this was
long before dating apps,

446
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,467
I was a sophomore at Brown

447
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,633
and Maggie was in her
first year at RISD.

448
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,133
- I was with some
friends at Free Play,

449
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:48,033
this bar in downtown Providence

450
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,633
with all these old arcade games.

451
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,567
- I challenged her to a
round of space invaders.

452
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,300
- And I wiped the
floor with his face.

453
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:58,233
- Okay and she has been
holding it over me ever since.

454
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:04,233
- It's a great story, yeah, I
actually meant you and Kate.

455
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,166
- Oh, we met on Bumble.

456
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,300
- S'mores by the fire
holiday movie Bingo,

457
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:22,900
wow, Kate has really outdone
herself with this lineup.

458
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:28,000
- She sure has, hey, I wanted
to run something by you.

459
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,600
What do you say we let Mia
get her ears pierced early?

460
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,400
- Before she turns 13?

461
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,133
- I know just she's
such a good kid

462
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,767
and this year hasn't been easy,

463
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,533
starting middle school and
all, I say we go for it.

464
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,133
- I think she'd be thrilled.

465
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:48,767
- Great, so we're agreed?
- Parents of the year.

466
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,133
Wow, that is an
impressive axe sir,

467
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,066
are you heading out on patrol?

468
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
- We're running out of firewood.

469
00:20:56,934 --> 00:21:00,834
- Right, yes, of course,
can I help you with that?

470
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,367
- Sure, you can hold the wood.

471
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,567
- Okay, have fun out
there, watch your fingers.

472
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:09,133
Hey, that's my cookie.

473
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,834
- You stole my room
now we're even.

474
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,867
- My walk-in closet is
the size of Rhode Island,

475
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,433
so, I think I got the
better end of the deal.

476
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:19,033
- Sassy, I like it but can
I give you some advice?

477
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,266
- Do I have a choice?

478
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,266
- You should definitely go
skiing with your kids tomorrow.

479
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,433
- I prefer my legs unbroken.

480
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,533
- First rule of
winning Christmas.

481
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,834
- Again with the winning.

482
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,266
- Don't stay home when
everybody's having fun.

483
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,367
- Okay, how many times
do I have to tell you,

484
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
this isn't a competition?

485
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,400
- If you say so.
- That looks so good.

486
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,200
- No, no, no it's
gonna be wonderful.

487
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:46,200
(gentle music)

488
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,533
- Okay, Sally squirrel it's
time to work your magic.

489
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,367
- [Kate] Sally squirrel
took a big sniff.

490
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,333
Mama, are those
Christmas cookies?

491
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,767
That's right, said
mama squirrel,

492
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,734
would you like to
decorate them with me?

493
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:18,367
Sally squirrel jumped up with
joy, I sure would she said

494
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:22,667
and she put her little
nose to all the sweets.

495
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,834
- Hey, you want
it on this action?

496
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:29,934
- Oh, that's okay
it's your vacation,

497
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,033
makes sense you'd be the
ones to tuck them in.

498
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,033
- I see you brought
your copy too.

499
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:39,367
- Yeah, I see you
brought matching pajamas.

500
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,233
- The girls are getting a little
old for scratch and sniff,

501
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,300
but traditions,
tradition, right?

502
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,367
- [Kate] Mama squirrel smiled,

503
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,233
Christmas is almost
here she said.

504
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,400
- She's a natural, right?

505
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,166
- Right in the corner.

506
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,000
- There you are I have been
looking for you everywhere.

507
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,467
- Come to return my robe?

508
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,533
- What, no,

509
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,300
I realized I may have misjudged
the situation slightly.

510
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,600
- Oh, yeah, what
situation is that?

511
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,400
- The Christmas situation.

512
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,533
- Oh, so, you admit
you need my help?

513
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,066
Thought you might
come to your senses.

514
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,967
- Hold your horses pretty boy,
I see how I'm gonna help you.

515
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,233
- How are you gonna help me?

516
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,967
- By keeping you
in the spotlight?

517
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,266
- And how is that exactly?

518
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,266
- Look I spent my entire
life in Kate's shadow,

519
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,500
I know a thing or two
about how this goes.

520
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,934
- All right, I'm in.

521
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,967
- Great, I booked
you a ski lesson.

522
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,433
- What?

523
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,166
- Had a feeling
you'd come around.

524
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,266
- Are you always this confident?

525
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,433
- Pretty much, see you on the
bunny hill, bright and early.

526
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,967
ill

527
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,600
was usually at the
bottom of the mountain.

528
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,300
- You know, you're kind of
cute when you're nervous?

529
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:17,734
- I'm not nervous, I'm just
not a big fan of heights.

530
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,333
- Really because you
seem pretty nervous.

531
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:22,500
- No, it's gonna be great.

532
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,567
This is so not great.

533
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,600
- The lesson hasn't
even started yet.

534
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:29,900
- [Maggie] Exactly.

535
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,100
- It'll be fun I promise.

536
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,567
- Fun for you or fun for me?

537
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,100
- Hi, welcome to kids on
skis so, guys just remember,

538
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:43,200
keep your poles to yourself,
Billy looking at you a lot,

539
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,734
all right, I'm just gonna
need all the adults now,

540
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,333
to head on over to
the viewing area.

541
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:51,800
- Oh, actually I'm signed up
for this class Maggie Collins.

542
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,900
- Oh, she's a kid at
heart she'll fit right in.

543
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,500
- They all are.

544
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,734
- Okay, listen, girls, I'll
be right over there watching.

545
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:03,533
- Oh, you really
don't need a watch.

546
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:04,600
- Oh, I really do.

547
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,233
- Excitement.

548
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:16,233
(ski instructor whistles)

549
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,367
- Is it possible
to get a bandage,

550
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,467
that doesn't resemble
a candy cane?

551
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,367
- Sorry.

552
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,900
- Well, I think it's festive.

553
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,533
- Is it broken?

554
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:32,166
- Oh, it's fine really
it's a strain not a sprain.

555
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,667
- She should stay off the
slopes for the rest of the day.

556
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,633
- Well, we can take
Sophie and Mia with us

557
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,834
and that way you can rest.

558
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,667
- I wanna stay with mom.

559
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,200
- Ah, I don't know kiddo.

560
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:47,333
- Nope, you can stay with
me, we'll just take it easy.

561
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,633
- Are you sure you don't
wanna come with us?

562
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,533
We can ski, grab a bite
to eat, go shopping.

563
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,667
- I'm sure we can find
something fun to do,

564
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,367
that doesn't
involve skis, right?

565
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:02,367
- You know, I know a spot
that has the best hot cocoa,

566
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,767
they make their own
marshmallows, do you
like marshmallows?

567
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,533
- I do.
- There you go.

568
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,367
All right, we're
pretty much set,

569
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,100
so yeah, we'll meet
up with you later.

570
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,633
- Just us?

571
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:21,800
- Don't forget the Nutcracker
tea starts at four.

572
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,533
- Well, I guess
marshmallows for the win,

573
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,300
guess this means I
owe you a pitch deck

574
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:34,734
and the restaurant you're
pitching is in this hotel?

575
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,900
- Yeah, the original
restaurant was through there.

576
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:40,300
- So, what are you
thinking for the menu?

577
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,934
Sushi, Yakitori, you
know, bring some of that,

578
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:46,266
Japanese flare back to Aspen?

579
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,533
- No, nothing like that,

580
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,467
I want the food to speak
to the Inn's history

581
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,667
in a way that's
honest and authentic.

582
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:58,233
I wanna put my own spin on
some of the classic dishes,

583
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,700
that were here in the
Butterfield's heyday.

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,600
- Wait a sec the
Butterfield Inn,

585
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:08,467
isn't this your family's hotel?

586
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
- It was.

587
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,166
- Were you planning
on telling me that?

588
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,133
- I don't know, maybe.

589
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,533
- Maybe?
- Maybe, eventually.

590
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:20,633
- Sam, you just said your
whole concept for the menu

591
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:24,266
is about history I mean, it
seems like it might behoove you,

592
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,333
to include your family's
history in the pitch.

593
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:30,667
- Behoove is that a fancy
word from design school.

594
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,834
- Okay look, you are the one
who wanted me to do this deck,

595
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,200
the only way it's gonna work
is if you've trust me enough,

596
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,533
to start sharing
the whole picture,

597
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,200
okay, who's that guy?

598
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:48,967
- That, oh, that
is Skip Whitaker.

599
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,233
- Handsome.
- He's my mom's grandfather.

600
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,266
Legend has it that his
father sent him out here,

601
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,367
to mine silver, Skip, took
the money for the mine

602
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,800
and he built himself a hotel.

603
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,066
- A rebel?

604
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,734
Now, I see where you get it.

605
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:06,834
- That was in 1892,

606
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,600
do you know all of the
woodwork in here is original?

607
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,233
- Wow, really is gorgeous.

608
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,734
Wait, so why did your
dad sell the place?

609
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,934
- My mom was in line
to take over the hotel,

610
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:29,767
she passed away and
then everything changed.

611
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,533
- I'm sorry.

612
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,600
- I tried to convince my dad
that I could take it over

613
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:38,700
and it would have worked
if it wasn't for the fact,

614
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,467
that I was all at 14 years old,

615
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:46,166
so, my dad put the
Butterfield on the market

616
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,266
and the rest as
they say is history.

617
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:54,233
- Yeah, that must've been
really hard on you and Kate,

618
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,700
losing your mom so young?

619
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,266
- We handled things differently,

620
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,834
you know, Kate, got really
close to my dad and me,

621
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:07,934
I took out a map of the world
started plotting my escape.

622
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:16,500
- I've never seen so many
gingerbread houses in one place.

623
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,900
- Right, do you know
that when I was your age,

624
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:20,467
my grand mom Mary,

625
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
taught me how to make
gingerbread from scratch?

626
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,667
This whole display
idea that was all hers.

627
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,900
- Can we make
gingerbread from scratch?

628
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:32,767
- Oh, bug, you know, I
think we better let Sam,

629
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,867
get back to his day.

630
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
- Well I have been meaning
to dig out that recipe,

631
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:40,967
family secret, now if I
teach you that recipe,

632
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,734
do you promise you won't
put it on the internet?

633
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,000
- I promise, promise.
- Promise.

634
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,767
Okay, let's bake.

635
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,066
You know, we should
probably get the roof on

636
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,834
before your mom eats
all the gum drops.

637
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:59,967
- She does that at home too.
- I do not, okay, I do.

638
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,834
- The icing's stuck.

639
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,800
- Okay, well try squeezing
it from the back,

640
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,166
like you do with toothpaste.

641
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,834
- I'll show you
Maggie, you got that?

642
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,734
- Okay, how do I?

643
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:16,800
- Oh, you're hands.

644
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,834
- Hello, the icing.

645
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:33,767
- I'm gonna let go, all
right, see what we got.

646
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,734
- All right, kitchen
is all yours,

647
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,834
just remember three hours
until the dinner crew rolls in,

648
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,166
cleared a shelf in
the walk-in for you.

649
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,767
- Oh, thanks man,

650
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,066
I'm gonna stick around
and test out some recipes.

651
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,100
- Why don't you cook
at your dad's house?

652
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:46,934
His kitchen is so nice.

653
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,266
- Well, I haven't
really told my family,

654
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,900
about my meeting
at the Butterfield.

655
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,533
- We'll have to keep it
quiet then won't we Soph?

656
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,100
- That means you too Charlie.

657
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,100
- Oh, I feel like I'm in Eloise.

658
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:09,800
- That's the Plaza mom,
look, there's dad and Kate.

659
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,300
- Hey, good to see you bug.

660
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,133
- Don't mind if I do.

661
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:14,367
- Fun day?

662
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,967
- We baked a gingerbread
house from scratch.

663
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,767
- Really?

664
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,066
- Yeah, it was
epic, where's Mia?

665
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,700
- Here she comes now.

666
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,800
- Thank you, thank you.
- For what sweetheart?

667
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:28,567
- For letting me
get my ears pierced,

668
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,967
Kate, helped me pick them out.

669
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
- Aren't they darling?

670
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,066
- You got your
ears pierced today?

671
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,567
- Yeah, dad said
you're okay with it.

672
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,900
- Well, she was so excited,

673
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,367
we figured no time
like the present.

674
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,066
- I was a little scared at first

675
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,834
but then it happened
so fast and it was done

676
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,500
and I have earrings.

677
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:49,000
- Oh, I'm gonna need
another one of those.

678
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:05,000
- Okay, the food in
this place is amazing

679
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,600
and I have never seen you,

680
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:09,467
turn down a tray of catering
brownies so what's up?

681
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,567
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

682
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:16,200
- It's just I was
planning on taking Mia,

683
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,266
to get her ears pierced myself,

684
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,500
it was gonna be my
big Christmas gift.

685
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,467
- I'm sorry, I had no idea,
why didn't you say so?

686
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,867
- I didn't think I had to
getting your ears pierced

687
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,133
is a mother, daughter
rite of passage,

688
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:32,300
it's right up there with
shopping for prom dresses

689
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:35,033
or watching Gilmore
Girls for the first time,

690
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:38,967
I have dibs on both
of those by the way.

691
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,367
- Yeah, I'm not gonna
watch Gilmore Girls.

692
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:47,500
- Okay, well maybe you
should tell Kate too,

693
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,033
just so there's no confusion.

694
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:50,867
- Understood.

695
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,700
- Sorry, I'm late,
what did I miss?

696
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,166
This is quite the production.

697
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,734
- The girls are having
the time of their lives.

698
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,367
- Oh, well, I mean
you think this is fun,

699
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,066
just wait till tomorrow
at the reindeer relay.

700
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,500
- The what now?

701
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,767
- A reindeer relay
it's like a decathlon,

702
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,834
where all the events
are Christmas themed.

703
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,400
- I don't remember seeing
that on the itinerary.

704
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,266
- Ah, Kate won't mind the add,

705
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,900
we used to do it every
year when we were kids,

706
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:19,033
the girls are gonna love
it, there's team events,

707
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,767
there's, there's trophies,

708
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,066
you are probably gonna
wanna save your energy

709
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,367
for the morning.

710
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,934
- Oh is that a fact?

711
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,700
- You know, Maggie's not
really into team sports,

712
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,734
I don't think anybody will
mind if you sit this one out,

713
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,767
that is if we even end up going.

714
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,467
- Oh yeah, it's happening.

715
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,900
- [Maggie] Sam.

716
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:49,600
- [Sam] Nothing has
changed since I was a kid.

717
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,400
- So, listen there is
something I need to tell you,

718
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,100
I can't skate.

719
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,166
- Oh, well, that's a rethink.

720
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,467
- Oh, good, we're finally all
here, team Blitzen let's go.

721
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:10,166
- Good luck out there,
you're gonna need it.

722
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,967
- We don't need
luck we have Susan.

723
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:21,633
- It's gonna be fine.

724
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,233
- They're going to win for sure.

725
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:27,734
- Okay, team huddle up,
do you know what I see,

726
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:28,934
when I look at this team?

727
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:29,734
- Amateurs.

728
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,834
- No, I see underdogs

729
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,567
and you never wanna
underestimate the underdog,

730
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,533
it's like Rudolph the
red-nosed reindeer,

731
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,133
classic, classic
underdog, no friends,

732
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:44,166
wasn't allowed to play
in the reindeer games,

733
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,100
nobody ever thought old Rudy
was gonna lead Santa's sleigh

734
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,767
but there he is every Christmas,

735
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,133
leading those
reindeer to victory.

736
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,633
- I think what Sam
is trying to say

737
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,667
is we need to
believe in ourselves.

738
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,033
- Exactly, look no
one expects us to win,

739
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:06,033
so, no one can see us coming
now are you with me underdogs?

740
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,200
- [All] Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

741
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,600
- [Sam] I'm gonna
help you get started.

742
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,200
(crowd cheering)

743
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,400
- Come on, come on, come on.

744
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:24,867
- Oh, my god, stop, stop.

745
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,667
(Maggie shrieks)

746
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:32,166
(crowd cheering)

747
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
- It's all right, I got you,

748
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,934
you got it, you got
it, there you go.

749
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,834
(crowd cheers)

750
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:01,033
- [Man] Now, our last
event, slap that Santa.

751
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,367
- [Jeff] You got this honey.

752
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,233
Slap it, slap that
Santa come on.

753
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,533
(people exclaiming and clapping)

754
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,800
- Hey, hey, hey, it's
all right, it's okay.

755
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:18,500
- You're gonna do this
mom, you can do this.

756
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:23,200
- [Maggie] Hey
guys, wish me luck.

757
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,433
- [Sophie] You can do it.

758
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,800
- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,

759
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,467
Maggie, Maggie,
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

760
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,934
(crowd cheers)

761
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,233
- [All] Go, underdogs.

762
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,900
- That was incredible,
what a rush,

763
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:59,233
this is going on my nightstand.

764
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,934
- Is that where you
put all your trophies?

765
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,233
- This is my first one.

766
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:05,767
- Come on, that can't be true.

767
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,734
- Have you met me?

768
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,600
- Listen, I had an idea
about the pitch deck,

769
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:11,200
tell me if I'm way off base

770
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,767
but what if we included
small photos of my family,

771
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,367
to Butterfield, too cheesy?

772
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,367
- Not at all it's just
so sentimental of you,

773
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,333
I mean, two days ago you
were hiding the fact,

774
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:29,467
it was your family's
Inn from me.

775
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,767
- I don't think
hiding is accurate.

776
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,600
- I am just saying it's a shift.

777
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,266
- Well, I did practically
grow up there.

778
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,266
- I know and that's what makes
you so perfect for this job,

779
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,500
I mean, it's not just any
old restaurant to you.

780
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:50,133
- You know running that kitchen
it'll be like coming home.

781
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,367
Wow, that was cheesy.

782
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,533
- That was good like,
like goosebumps good.

783
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,100
I'm gonna write that down,
can I trust you with this?

784
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:12,633
- No, I will be careful.
- Very gentle.

785
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,867
- Typical Sam, swoops
in at the last minute

786
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,100
and steals my thunder.

787
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:21,100
- I know y'all take this
relay business seriously

788
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,533
but come on it's just a trophy.

789
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,100
- Hey, it's not
about the trophy,

790
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:28,967
he's got Maggie and the girls
wrapped around his finger,

791
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,166
did you see how much
fun they were having?

792
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,900
- To be honest I was busy
focusing on standing upright

793
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,233
but now you mentioned it.

794
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:44,133
- See, why can't I get
Maggie to laugh like that?

795
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,600
(gentle music)

796
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:02,333
- Oh is this where
sore losers hang out

797
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,567
and lick their wounds?

798
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,400
- Surely you didn't come all
the way down here to gloat?

799
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,700
- No, just an unexpected bonus,

800
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:12,133
so, do you know where mom's
old photo albums might be?

801
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,667
- Try that box right there.

802
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,633
You remember this?

803
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,500
- Yeah, mom loved that star,

804
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,633
Dad bought it for their first
Christmas together, right?

805
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:30,200
- Yeah, this box is
full of old ornaments.

806
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,800
- Oh, look at this it's
from the year we won state,

807
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,934
I scored a goal in the first
period you were there right?

808
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:52,533
Mom looks so young there,

809
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,667
ah, Christmas isn't
the same without her.

810
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,433
- You know what I miss?

811
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:00,300
Her toffee.

812
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:02,433
- With the slivered
almonds on top.

813
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,767
- I follow her recipe every year

814
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,633
and it never turns out right,

815
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:13,767
she always made Christmas
so special, so warm.

816
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:18,667
how come when I try it it
winds up as an itinerary?

817
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,467
- Maybe stop trying so hard.

818
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,066
- Easy for you to say
Mr. flying from Tokyo

819
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,333
and make ginger
bread from scratch.

820
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,100
- Okay, you think dad
would wanna put up,

821
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:31,133
some of these decorations?

822
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,400
- They're mom's not Susan's.

823
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,500
- Yeah but these are
dad's memory, I mean,
they're ours too.

824
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,600
- Maybe it's hard on Susan
being reminded of dad's past.

825
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:43,400
- Is that what it's like for
you you know, Maggie around?

826
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:47,367
- Well, it's different Maggie
and Jeff are still family,

827
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,333
I mean, maybe not in
the conventional sense

828
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,867
but they're still very
much in each other's lives.

829
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,066
- And you're good with that?

830
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,166
- It's kind of a package deal.

831
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,266
And you are not helping either,

832
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:08,200
fanning the flames out on
the ice all Maggie, Maggie.

833
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,166
- Oh, come on, why?

834
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,266
I can't cheer on my team?

835
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,200
- Sam, you have got her
thinking that I'm the enemy,

836
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:20,100
I don't wanna be the enemy, I
wanna be part of her family.

837
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,567
- Try looking at things
from Maggie's perspective,

838
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,867
I mean, it can't be easy
having a front row seat

839
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,600
to the Jeff and Kate show.

840
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,734
Maybe she's just
trying to figure out
where she fits in too.

841
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:46,734
- It's open.

842
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,066
- Hey, what you working on?

843
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,700
- Oh, last minute
project for a client,

844
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:57,900
how's it going with the
operation woo the parents?

845
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:00,633
You and Ted looked pretty
chummy out there on the ice?

846
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:04,000
- Oh, well I could say the same
about you and chef Boyardee.

847
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,367
- He was just trying to
keep me from falling.

848
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,233
- Oh, come on, he's
totally into you,

849
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,900
every time I look over
you two are busy flirting.

850
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,767
- Okay, first of all,
we're not flirting,

851
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,800
we're making polite conversation

852
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,834
but even if we were
flirting which we're not,

853
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,233
how is that a problem?

854
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:24,867
- Well, he just doesn't
seem like the type of guy,

855
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,266
who wants to settle down.

856
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:31,834
- Really, who says I'm
looking for something serious?

857
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,967
Relax, there's no there, there.

858
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,533
- Hey, is this a bad time.

859
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:45,834
- No, come on in, you wanna
go check on the girls?

860
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,467
- No, they're fine,

861
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,700
Kate has them making
reindeer out of clothespins,

862
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,100
so, sounds like fun.

863
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:57,734
Sam, Sam, the man
what's happening?

864
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:04,300
- Not much just living.

865
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:05,700
- Seize the day am I right?

866
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,033
- Anyway, I was gonna
head down to Charlie's,

867
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:10,834
I just wanted to-

868
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,066
- Oh, please.

869
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:17,767
- Oh, this is cool.

870
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,967
- Did you bring
ornaments from home?

871
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,500
- I know, I know
it's overkill right,

872
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:24,166
it's just the girls and I
love decorating the tree,

873
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,700
it's one of our
favorite traditions.

874
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:27,800
- Yeah, it's mine too.

875
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:30,967
- Really, I thought all of
the Reynolds family trees,

876
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,433
were professionally done?

877
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,533
- Well, before my
dad married Susan,

878
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:35,900
we always decorated our own.

879
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,800
Yeah, Kate and I would
always fight over,

880
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:40,934
who got to hang
the first ornament.

881
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:45,266
- Me and Sophie, do that too.

882
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,300
- Who's Charlie?

883
00:43:47,467 --> 00:43:48,600
You were saying that,

884
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:50,367
you were gonna head
over to Charlie's place?

885
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,567
- Charlie is a buddy
of mine in town,

886
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,867
yeah, I should probably
get going so talk later.

887
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,700
- If you want I
can talk to Kate,

888
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,934
see if you and the girls
could hang some of these out.

889
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,967
- Nah, kind of like having
them in here with me.

890
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,934
- I realize your
meeting is tomorrow

891
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:35,233
but can we talk about this later
perhaps when the sun is up?

892
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:37,233
- Oh no, no, no, no you don't,

893
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,300
come on you need to get dressed,

894
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:40,967
let's go we're taking the
girls on an adventure.

895
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,734
- Kate is taking them
snow tubing this morning

896
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:46,100
and I would rather not
mess with her plan.

897
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,133
- It's fine it doesn't
start until 10 okay,

898
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,000
we'll be back in plenty of time,

899
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:51,900
really, you always this
pokey in the morning?

900
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:53,633
- You think I'm slow?

901
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:55,600
good luck getting
my kids out of bed.

902
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:01,834
- Come on mom, let's go.

903
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,600
(cheerful music)

904
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:12,600
- [Mia] This is so cool.

905
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:16,734
Sophie look.
- Wow.

906
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:20,400
- We're not flying on one
of those planes, are we?

907
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:22,767
- Nope.
- Oh, thank goodness.

908
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,867
- That's our ride.

909
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,800
- Yeah, who's the
pilot Kris Kringle?

910
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:32,066
- Actually I am.

911
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,166
- Yeah, like you know
how to fly a helicopter?

912
00:45:37,433 --> 00:45:39,567
You know, how to
fly a helicopter?

913
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,367
(helicopter rotors chuffing)

914
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,567
- Best view in town am I right?

915
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,700
- How much longer
till we head back?

916
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,934
- Well, we got to make
a quick pit stop first.

917
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:59,100
(Maggie screams)

918
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:01,300
We're here to pick
out a Christmas tree.

919
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:03,400
- But you already have so many.

920
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,467
- Well, this is a special one,

921
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,633
this one's for your mom's
room so, she can hang,

922
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:10,100
all the special ornaments
she brought from home,

923
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:12,066
why don't you guys go
on ahead we'll catch up,

924
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,066
don't go too far though.

925
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,967
- Be careful.

926
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,800
- I hope this is okay, I
know you were talking about,

927
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,100
how much you guys love
decorating the tree

928
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:22,700
and it got me thinking.
- About helicopters?

929
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,734
- No, about Mia and Sophie,

930
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,166
they might be missing some
of their traditions too,

931
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,266
I mean, there's
also the added bonus

932
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,900
of seeing you in snow shoes.

933
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,533
- Okay coach, any pointers?

934
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:41,433
- Well, it's easy just put one
foot in front of the other.

935
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:47,934
Not bad.

936
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:52,233
- You know what they say never
underestimate the underdog.

937
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:07,867
- Whoa, what's going on in here
I am adding stocking hooks,

938
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,934
we need one for Sam of course

939
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:13,333
and Maggie brought hers from
home which was unexpected,

940
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:18,467
so, that is four more, I have
them perfectly spaced out

941
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:22,367
but I'm fine starting
over it is no big deal.

942
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,166
- You seem a little stressed.

943
00:47:29,233 --> 00:47:30,934
- I was supposed to
take the girls out,

944
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:32,300
snow tubing this morning

945
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,967
but Maggie has them off
doing something else.

946
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,133
I'm pretty sure I
offended her again.

947
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:44,700
- Is it possible that she just
wanted to spend some time,

948
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:46,300
alone with her daughters?

949
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:48,867
- Do you think I'm overreacting?

950
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,834
- These things take time.

951
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:53,000
- I know, I know,

952
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,133
Maggie is such an important
part of the girls lives

953
00:47:57,266 --> 00:48:00,233
and Jeff's too and sometimes,

954
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:03,166
I feel like I'm
crashing their party.

955
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,533
- Hey, they are
lucky to have you.

956
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:10,734
- I just wanted this
Christmas to be perfect,

957
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:12,200
like moms always were.

958
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:15,200
- Well, if it's any consolation,

959
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,100
I think you're doing
a wonderful job.

960
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,834
Now, let me help you
with these stockings.

961
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,033
- Okay, here.

962
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:35,000
- Daddy, look we chopped down
a tree in the real forest.

963
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:38,834
- Wow, another tree that's
what this place needs.

964
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:41,066
- Did we miss snow tubing?

965
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,200
- Yeah, I'm sorry kiddo,
the tickets were timed,

966
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,533
why don't you guys run
inside and get warm?

967
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,266
- Can we have a minute?

968
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,633
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

969
00:49:01,266 --> 00:49:05,266
- You look mad, don't be mad,
I'm really sorry we were late,

970
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,567
cable release wasn't working,

971
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,300
when we tried to long
line the Christmas tree,

972
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:09,934
so, we had to call for back up.

973
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:12,633
- Do you even hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

974
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:13,533
- I know, right?

975
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,266
- Kate, was supposed
to take the girls,

976
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,066
snow tubing this morning but
you just up and disappeared.

977
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,100
- Nope, Hector,
knew where we were.

978
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,934
- Yeah, but I didn't, I'm
sitting at breakfast with Ted,

979
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:25,300
waiting for the girls
to come downstairs

980
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:28,000
and how do you think it looked,

981
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,000
me not knowing where
my own kids were?

982
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:32,300
- So, this is about Ted?

983
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:34,400
- And Kate, she
worked her butt off,

984
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:35,834
to make this trip
special for the girls

985
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:37,800
and all you have
to do was show up

986
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:38,967
and go along for the ride.

987
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,266
- Well, forgive me for wanting,

988
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,266
to spend a little
time with our kids,

989
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,066
she has them scheduled 24/7.

990
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,266
- Yeah, that's because Kate
is organized and responsible,

991
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,700
she doesn't just tag
along and create chaos.

992
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:54,100
- Me create chaos,
you're the one,

993
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:56,300
who wanted to change
things up this Christmas,

994
00:49:56,433 --> 00:49:59,667
you said all of this in motion
and I will have you know,

995
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,133
I am quite capable
of making plans,

996
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:05,467
I planned to take Mia, to get
her ears pierced in Aspen,

997
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,233
I called ahead and
made an appointment.

998
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:08,800
- Again, with the earrings,

999
00:50:08,934 --> 00:50:10,300
I told you it was
an honest mistake.

1000
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:12,800
- That was my moment
to have not yours

1001
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:14,100
and certainly not Kate's.

1002
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:16,133
- Well, this was
supposed to be my moment,

1003
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,667
my first vacation
with Kate's family

1004
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,166
and your gumming up the works,

1005
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,166
it's almost like you're trying
to screw things up for me.

1006
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,467
- What?

1007
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,166
I am only here because Kate
practically begged me to come.

1008
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,133
- Oh, come on, you
jumped at the chance

1009
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:30,066
and now you're running
around making googly eyes

1010
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,133
with her brother.
- Googly eyes what am I 12?

1011
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:35,166
- Look, I don't care what
you do on your own time

1012
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,233
but this trip isn't about you,

1013
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,533
it's about me and Kate
and the girls period.

1014
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,100
- I have the deck to show
you if now's a good time.

1015
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:58,200
- Yeah, now works,
show me what you got.

1016
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:04,734
- You're sweaty.

1017
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:06,734
- I am sweaty yeah, should
I just lose the shirt?

1018
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:08,400
I mean, just right off,

1019
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:09,700
I can just get rid
of it really easily.

1020
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,467
- Can we stick to
business please.

1021
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,800
- Yes, you got it.

1022
00:51:13,934 --> 00:51:15,900
- Okay, yeah, this
thing between us,

1023
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:19,133
it is strictly professional,

1024
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:22,467
like I would flirt with you
just to make things hard on him.

1025
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,233
- For who for Jeff?

1026
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,066
- He basically just accused
me of trying to undermine,

1027
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,367
his relationship with Kate

1028
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,367
and I have been nothing but
supportive, did I make a fuss,

1029
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,066
when a photo I took of
Kate and Mia on Halloween,

1030
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,800
wound up on Jeff's
Instagram feed

1031
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:40,233
with the caption my two
boo's, no, I did not

1032
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:42,667
because I am evolved and mature.

1033
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,467
- And frustrated.

1034
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,700
- So, very frustrated.

1035
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:50,834
- You know, what
really helps that?

1036
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,967
Smashing little rubber
balls against the wall,

1037
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,834
come on, give a shot, I promise
you, you will feel better.

1038
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,333
- This isn't gonna work.

1039
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:11,367
Are you okay?

1040
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,300
- It's all right, I've been
hit in the face much harder,

1041
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:15,533
no offense, no.

1042
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:16,567
- Does it hurt?

1043
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,433
- Not really it's okay.

1044
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,500
- How about I walk you
through the PowerPoint.

1045
00:52:35,934 --> 00:52:38,500
- Right now, right now?

1046
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,667
- Yeah here.

1047
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:48,934
Have a look.

1048
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,133
- Wow, this is incredible,

1049
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,433
I mean, it feels
like the Butterfield.

1050
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:08,667
- Yeah, the woodwork
pattern from the lobby

1051
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,967
is along the border.

1052
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,200
- Wait did you switch
the order around?

1053
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:18,600
- Yeah, I think it makes
more sense to hit them

1054
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:21,800
with the personal connection
right from the top,

1055
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:23,367
it just really draws them in,

1056
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,967
especially with those
amazing photos you found.

1057
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,500
But I can change it
back if you want.

1058
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:38,734
- No, no, no, it's it's
much stronger this way,

1059
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,233
it just kinda hit me you know,

1060
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,633
I'm actually actually
pitching Butterfield tomorrow.

1061
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:53,533
- You're gonna knock
it out of the park

1062
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,567
but we should print
it out just in case.

1063
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,100
- I think I know
the perfect place.

1064
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,734
- This is crazy, what
if your dad walks in

1065
00:54:08,867 --> 00:54:10,367
and sees the deck?

1066
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,600
- And I'll be right outside
keeping watch, it's okay.

1067
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:17,200
(Maggie trips and
falls with a thud)

1068
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,567
- Everything okay?
- All good.

1069
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:41,533
- How's it going
in there, you good?

1070
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,867
- Whoa, again, all jumbled up.

1071
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,600
- Wow, this looks so fun
can I borrow you for a sec?

1072
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:54,033
- Yeah, we're a
little busy here.

1073
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,900
- Trust me the jingle bell
crafting session can wait,

1074
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,834
you are not gonna believe what
I just found in Ted's office,

1075
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:05,400
he has a folder on you,
it's more like a dossier,

1076
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:07,233
he has photos, a
background check.

1077
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:08,567
- What were you doing
in Ted's office?

1078
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,734
- Did you hear what I just said?

1079
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:13,633
He had you investigated Jeff
as in private investigated

1080
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:17,500
with a capital P and a capital
I, I mean, who does that?

1081
00:55:17,633 --> 00:55:18,633
Who are these people?

1082
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:21,233
Do you think he has files
on all of Kate's boyfriends?

1083
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:23,767
- Probably just the ones who
ask if they can marry her.

1084
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:27,600
- You're getting married?

1085
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:28,700
- If she says yes.

1086
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:36,500
- Wow, that's huge.

1087
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,600
Why didn't you say anything?

1088
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,834
- I thought Kate should
be the first to know.

1089
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,800
I'm gonna ask her
tomorrow night at dinner.

1090
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:52,066
- You're proposing
on Christmas Eve?

1091
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,567
- Whoa do you mind
keeping it down,

1092
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,433
I'm trying to keep
it a secret here.

1093
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,066
- Are you sure
that's a good idea,

1094
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,633
just bringing it on the girls?

1095
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:04,166
- Well, it's not like we
haven't talked about it before.

1096
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,000
- What, you have when?

1097
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:08,367
- A few weeks back, I
asked how they would feel

1098
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,100
if Kate joined the family,
they were all for it.

1099
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,467
Now can I get back to
my crafting please?

1100
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,233
- Yeah, congratulations.
- Thank you.

1101
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,066
- Yep, we're spending
Christmas Eve with dad and Kate

1102
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,734
and you'll be back in time for
presents tomorrow, can I go?

1103
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:37,734
Susan's letting me rearrange
the nativity scene.

1104
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:39,734
- Okay, have fun.

1105
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,467
Don't you wanna
reorder the wise men?

1106
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:48,100
- I thought we were spending
Christmas Eve all together.

1107
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:51,633
- I know sweet girl but
you're gonna have so much fun,

1108
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:53,767
you're not even gonna
realize I was gone.

1109
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,033
- Where will you go?

1110
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,033
- I am gonna go downtown,

1111
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,934
I booked a facial at
the St. Mark hotel

1112
00:57:01,066 --> 00:57:03,600
and then before you know
it we will all be together,

1113
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,200
right by that tree.

1114
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:07,967
- Actually, Santa visits
the tree in the great room,

1115
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,567
I asked Hector.
- Oh, good thinking.

1116
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:13,800
Come here, huggy,
kissy, see you later.

1117
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,133
- Hey, hey, any chance
you'd be willing,

1118
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:24,000
to listen to me
practice my pitch?

1119
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:27,633
- I would love to but I
have an Uber driver coming,

1120
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:30,000
oh, come on, Marty Zee, you too,

1121
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,333
that's the third
driver to cancel on me.

1122
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:35,767
- Yeah, it's the hill most
cars can't make it up,

1123
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,133
I'm heading the
Butterfield in an hour,

1124
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:38,800
I can give you a ride if
you're willing to wait.

1125
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:42,667
- Thank you but I
think I'll keep trying.

1126
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,433
- Yeah, don't wanna be
late for your facial.

1127
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,266
- Word does travel
fast in this town?

1128
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,000
- See, here's the thing,

1129
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,200
I know for a fact you're
not getting a facial.

1130
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:53,800
- Says who?

1131
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:56,533
- Says Linda, the receptionist
at the St. Mark's day spa.

1132
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:59,633
See, I called over there and
tried to sweet talk them,

1133
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,233
into giving you a massage,

1134
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:03,400
since clearly the last
thing you need is a facial.

1135
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:07,867
Kate, says you're skipping
out on dinner too, true?

1136
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,734
- Okay, look, I cannot
be at that dinner,

1137
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,000
I need to get out of here now.

1138
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:17,934
- It's okay, we'll figure it
out do you wanna talk about it?

1139
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,967
- Jeff is asking Kate to
marry him at dinner tonight.

1140
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,667
- Okay, wow.

1141
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,867
- Yeah and I would rather not
be here to watch it go down.

1142
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,600
- Wait, so you're gonna
spend Christmas Eve alone

1143
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:46,333
in a town you don't know
not getting a facial?

1144
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:47,533
- That's the plan.

1145
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,867
- Okay, I'm coming with you.

1146
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,734
- No but the Butterfield?

1147
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:55,667
- It's fine I'll tell them
something important came up,

1148
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
which is it's true by the way.

1149
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:59,967
- No, I cannot let you do
this, this is your big shot,

1150
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,367
your once in a lifetime.

1151
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:10,767
- I'll reschedule, I can
change my flight if I need to.

1152
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,834
Unless you wanna be alone.

1153
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:23,100
- To be honest, I could
really use the company.

1154
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,967
- Great, it's settled.
- Great.

1155
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,834
Where should we go?

1156
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:37,800
- Now, I know it's not a massage

1157
00:59:37,934 --> 00:59:39,533
but thought you might like it.

1158
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:41,934
- This is gorgeous.

1159
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:45,300
- It's a pool it's fed
by a natural hot spring,

1160
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:48,100
lucky for us it's
closed for the night.

1161
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:51,800
- And you just
happened to have a key?

1162
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,834
- Wow, I know a guy.

1163
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,900
- What's in the thermos?

1164
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:58,033
- Mulled cider to
warm us up afterwards.

1165
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,900
Come on, when's the next time,

1166
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:06,300
you'll be at a natural hot
spring on Christmas Eve?

1167
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:08,200
You're not gonna
make me go in alone.

1168
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:18,433
Come on.
- Oh, fine.

1169
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:36,967
Homemade cider, jazzy
Christmas vibes,

1170
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:40,734
does this work on all the other
women you've brought here?

1171
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:43,834
- Ah, wouldn't know,
never brought anyone here.

1172
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:45,967
- Seriously?

1173
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:50,900
- We used to come here when
I was a kid on Christmas Eve,

1174
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:52,300
the cider is my mom's recipe,

1175
01:00:53,467 --> 01:00:55,467
technically you're not supposed
to bring drinks in here

1176
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,734
but somehow she always
found a way to sneak it in.

1177
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,967
- That's legitimately awesome.

1178
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,967
- She was magic my
mom, she loved it here.

1179
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,834
- I can see why, so peaceful.

1180
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:15,133
- And then we would soak for
hours and sit by the fire

1181
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:16,934
and wait for the
stars to come out.

1182
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:20,734
My mom had this thing about
wishing on a North star

1183
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:25,667
on Christmas Eve, she said
it was like birthday candles,

1184
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,867
eyelashes and wishbones
all rolled into one.

1185
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,967
- No pressure.

1186
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,567
- Well, you know, for me
it was all about BMX bikes

1187
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,066
and latest video
games but for my mom,

1188
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,367
she always had the same wish,

1189
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:46,333
she wished to be as
happy year around

1190
01:01:46,467 --> 01:01:47,900
as she was in that moment.

1191
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:54,500
We stopped coming here
after my mom died,

1192
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:58,066
I guess my dad thought
it'd be easier,

1193
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,700
to start some new traditions.

1194
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:04,900
- I gotta say this beats
caroling hands down

1195
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,467
and you know how
much I love to sing.

1196
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,767
- Can I ask you
something personal?

1197
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,667
- Go ahead.

1198
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:20,934
- Is the reason you didn't
wanna go to dinner tonight

1199
01:02:21,066 --> 01:02:23,233
because you're not over Jeff?

1200
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:31,066
- No, no, not at all, we were
so young when we got married,

1201
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:36,000
I never been in a real
relationship before,

1202
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:39,400
you know how
everybody always says,

1203
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:41,166
you should marry
your best friend,

1204
01:02:43,066 --> 01:02:46,100
thing is that that's
all we ever were,

1205
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:52,800
we never had that thing.

1206
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:55,734
- That thing is important.
- It is.

1207
01:02:58,867 --> 01:03:00,667
- You're sure you're over him?

1208
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,133
- 100%.

1209
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:08,333
- Well will it be okay if I.

1210
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,100
- Was that your big move?

1211
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:17,000
- Well, that
depends did it work?

1212
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,166
Wow, best Christmas ever.

1213
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,633
(phone ringing)

1214
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:40,867
- Oh, that's my phone
I should get it.

1215
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,066
- I'll get it, I'll get it.

1216
01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:53,133
It's Mia.
- Hey, is everything okay?

1217
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:55,967
Wait, okay, slow down a sec,

1218
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,200
no, of course, of course
I'll be right there,

1219
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,633
that was Mia, she's at the
hotel St. Mark's looking for me.

1220
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,133
- Ho, ho, ho and welcome
to the hotel St. Mark.

1221
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:18,367
- Which way's the day spa?

1222
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,867
- Mom.
- Maggie, Sam.

1223
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,600
She was quite eager to
see you after dinner.

1224
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:27,166
- I'm so sorry.

1225
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,100
- Sam, I'll be right back,
I'm parked in a tow away zone.

1226
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,100
- Thank you.

1227
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,333
- You sure you're okay.
- Yeah.

1228
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,467
- I'm gonna go call
your dad and Kate

1229
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,166
and let them know
we're with you.

1230
01:04:38,066 --> 01:04:40,100
Don't go anywhere.
- I won't.

1231
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,266
- Will you watch her?

1232
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:51,667
(gentle music)

1233
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,600
- Big night huh?

1234
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,800
You know, I remember
when my dad told me,

1235
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:07,433
he was getting remarried,
a punch in the gut.

1236
01:05:09,133 --> 01:05:12,233
- Everything just
happened so fast

1237
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:14,367
and everyone was looking at me.

1238
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:18,233
- Like you're supposed
to jump for joy

1239
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:20,867
and you just heard the
news five seconds before.

1240
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,433
- Yeah, I mean I knew
it was coming eventually

1241
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:29,333
but now it's real.

1242
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,367
- Hard to process, I get it.

1243
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:49,333
- Hey kiddo you okay?

1244
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:56,867
- I'm sorry I left.

1245
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,233
- That's okay, I'm just
glad you're all right.

1246
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,266
- Mia and I are
gonna have a little,

1247
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,300
one-on-one time in
my room, right kiddo.

1248
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:18,467
- Oh, hey, I heard
you're marrying my
sister, congrats mate.

1249
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,600
- Thanks, Sam, how did she
seem to you, Mia I mean?

1250
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:28,533
- You know, a little
thrown off guard maybe

1251
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:31,233
but I think that comes
with the territory.

1252
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:35,600
- It's the first time
she's ever run away,

1253
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:37,533
still counts as running
away if Hector told us,

1254
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,266
where he was taking her right?

1255
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:43,767
- You know, when I found out
my dad was proposing to Susan,

1256
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,266
I hopped on a flight to
Bangkok and spent a month,

1257
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,533
sweeping floors in a
Buddhist monastery,

1258
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:51,700
those monks taught me
everything I know about curry,

1259
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:54,400
I guess what I'm
saying is just be glad,

1260
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,266
she only made as far as the spa.

1261
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,033
- Yeah, man you make
your own Thai food

1262
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:00,333
is there anything you don't do?

1263
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:03,567
- You look hungry come on,
I'll make you something to eat.

1264
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,867
- You have to promise me
the next time you're upset,

1265
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,233
you won't run away?

1266
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:13,533
- But you did.

1267
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,500
- That's different,

1268
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,500
your dad and Kate are
starting a new life together,

1269
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,166
I wanted to give
them some space,

1270
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:29,033
let them have their
special moment.

1271
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:37,433
And to be honest I didn't think
it would be that much fun,

1272
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:40,433
watching him propose
to someone else.

1273
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:42,533
- Yeah, it really wasn't.

1274
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:47,667
- Oh, babe I'm sorry, I
thought you'd be excited,

1275
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:50,500
you like Kate don't you?

1276
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:55,633
- Yeah but she's not you,
I mean, I like our life,

1277
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,400
I like how we do Christmas.

1278
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,233
- I know, change is hard

1279
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,333
and you have had so
much of it lately,

1280
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:11,734
new school, new
friends, new crushes.

1281
01:08:11,867 --> 01:08:12,633
- Mom.

1282
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,467
- You have been such a
trooper through all of it,

1283
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:23,033
that's why I changed my
mind about the earrings,

1284
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,367
I realized that the reason
I was holding on so tight

1285
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,734
was because deep down I
didn't want things to change,

1286
01:08:35,467 --> 01:08:39,467
if I had my way you would
stay my little girl forever,

1287
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:47,033
but you've already become
this smart and funny,

1288
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,266
fiercely independent
young woman.

1289
01:08:55,867 --> 01:08:58,533
I think it's time for
me to start letting go.

1290
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,667
- Maybe don't let go just yet.

1291
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:12,066
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1292
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
- [Sophie] Can I come in?

1293
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:17,467
These are for Santa but I
think we need them more.

1294
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,700
- I think you're right
come sit with us.

1295
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,600
Hey, I want you two to know,

1296
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:27,767
that I am really
happy for your dad

1297
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,600
and I think Kate is
pretty terrific too.

1298
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:33,567
- You do, since when?

1299
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,633
- Let's just say
I'm working on it.

1300
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:41,834
I know just the
thing to cheer us up,

1301
01:09:42,934 --> 01:09:45,133
look who came to Aspen.

1302
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:47,000
- Sir Santa-Lot.
- Sir Santa-Lot.

1303
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:49,333
- I thought he
might come in handy.

1304
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,500
- So, this is where
the party's at,

1305
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,800
I found these in the basement.

1306
01:09:53,934 --> 01:09:55,500
- Oh, ornaments.

1307
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:58,166
- They are the ones we used
to hang when we were kids.

1308
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,500
- How come you don't hang
them on one of your trees now?

1309
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:05,633
- You know, that is a very
good question and I think,

1310
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:08,734
I'm gonna have a chat with
my dad and Susan about that

1311
01:10:08,867 --> 01:10:11,800
but in the meantime I thought
we could hang out with yours?

1312
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:13,800
If that's okay?

1313
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,266
- Yeah, get them on the tree,

1314
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,700
so, any word from
the Butterfield?

1315
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:26,433
- It turns out the owners are
flying out tomorrow night,

1316
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:27,767
so, might have missed my chance.

1317
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,367
- Oh no, I am so sorry.
- No, no, I'm not.

1318
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,467
You know, this is
the first time,

1319
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,500
I've been home for
Christmas in years,

1320
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,767
with my mom gone guess I didn't
feel like I fit in anymore

1321
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:45,633
but this time around
feels different.

1322
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:50,600
- I'm happy you're here.
- Me too.

1323
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:55,433
Plus now I'm not the only
Christmas crasher so that helps.

1324
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:58,767
- [Sophie] Mom, look at
this, got to see this.

1325
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,467
- Is that you?

1326
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,734
- Oh, no, no, that's going
back in the basement,

1327
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:05,600
come here, let me have
that, oh, it's so cute.

1328
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,700
- Oh, Kate, one of Santa's
elves left these gifts,

1329
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:35,300
by the wrong tree, I won't be
a minute, how are you doing?

1330
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:39,467
- Oh, you know, just
hanging out by the tree,

1331
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:42,767
wondering what I did to
make a 12 year old run away.

1332
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,467
- Mia's crazy about you,
you know that right?

1333
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,667
- I thought we were
getting along so well,

1334
01:11:50,066 --> 01:11:52,033
until Jeff proposed.

1335
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:55,100
- I'll admit it
was a bold choice,

1336
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:56,934
asking you in front of everyone,

1337
01:11:57,066 --> 01:11:59,834
it shows a certain confidence.

1338
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:04,934
Here's what I have learned
about being a stepmother,

1339
01:12:05,066 --> 01:12:07,266
it is not a competition,

1340
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,800
Maggie, will always be
Mia and Sophie's mom

1341
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:13,433
and all you have to do is
be your wonderful self,

1342
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,900
Mia will come around eventually.

1343
01:12:16,734 --> 01:12:18,500
- You really think so.
- I know so.

1344
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,633
- Are those for
tomorrow morning?

1345
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:34,166
- Yeah, Mia, said
something about,

1346
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,133
missing the cinnamon
rolls in Austin.

1347
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,533
- You know, I'm not
one to give you advice,

1348
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:45,934
about your love life, I
tend to think it's best,

1349
01:12:46,066 --> 01:12:48,500
to let you figure these
things out on your own.

1350
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,567
- Why do I sense
there's a but coming?

1351
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,800
- Maggie's, a wonderful woman
and the sparks between you two

1352
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:00,533
could light up a Christmas tree

1353
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,100
but Jeff and Kate
are getting married,

1354
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:07,900
which means that Mia and Sophie,

1355
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:09,734
are gonna be a part
of this family,

1356
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:11,467
hopefully for a long time.

1357
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:15,567
- You don't think I
have what it takes,

1358
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,867
to make a relationship
last right?

1359
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,834
- Your lifestyle
hardly lands itself,

1360
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:25,200
to a long-term relationship,
you're a chef in Japan,

1361
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,033
have you thought this through?

1362
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,100
- It's a working progress.

1363
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,533
- Let's say you and
Maggie do get together

1364
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:41,967
and it doesn't work out, would
that be fair to the girls?

1365
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,100
I mean, they got a world
of change coming their way,

1366
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,734
do you really wanna be the guy,

1367
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:50,867
that makes their
lives more confusing?

1368
01:13:56,133 --> 01:14:00,467
- I think I liked it better
when you didn't give advice.

1369
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,967
- I bet those cinnamon rolls
are gonna be incredible.

1370
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:11,934
Don't stay up too late.
- Yeah, okay?

1371
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:25,967
- Just a sec.

1372
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,834
Oh, it's you.

1373
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:36,400
- Not the man you
were expecting?

1374
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:40,166
- Yeah, apparently punctuality
isn't his strong point.

1375
01:14:42,266 --> 01:14:44,633
Come on in.
- Thank you.

1376
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:49,500
Oh, so this is the
helicopter tree.

1377
01:14:49,633 --> 01:14:51,133
- Is that what we're calling it?

1378
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,667
- I don't recognize
some of these ornaments.

1379
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,867
- They're on loan
from the basement.

1380
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,367
- No, is that Kate?

1381
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,266
- I think so.

1382
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,266
- These look good all together.

1383
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,500
The girls are out like a light.

1384
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:15,500
- Yeah, they had a
big day, we all did.

1385
01:15:19,467 --> 01:15:22,934
- I screwed up big time,

1386
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,333
I should've told the girls
I was gonna propose today.

1387
01:15:29,033 --> 01:15:31,533
- Well, in your defense,

1388
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:33,800
Mia, can't keep a
secret to save her life.

1389
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:36,500
- I know right, where did
we go wrong with that one?

1390
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:37,400
- That was you.

1391
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,367
- You think she's okay?

1392
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:46,033
- Yes, I think she just
needs a little time.

1393
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:51,100
- And you, are we good?

1394
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,734
- I'm gonna be honest,

1395
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:58,433
I really wish you would
have told me in advance.

1396
01:16:00,066 --> 01:16:01,734
- If I had you
would've stayed home

1397
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:07,266
and well Christmas
wouldn't be Christmas,

1398
01:16:09,066 --> 01:16:12,066
I like spending it together.
- Yeah, me too.

1399
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,066
That may have to change.
- Yeah, I know.

1400
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:28,567
Is that sir Santa-Lot?
- Yes it is.

1401
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,233
- Crashing through the snow
in a one man open sleigh.

1402
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:40,333
- Okay, now it is Christmas.
- Oh, what a cutie.

1403
01:16:42,033 --> 01:16:43,233
Well, I better get
out of your hair,

1404
01:16:43,367 --> 01:16:45,066
I don't wanna
overstay my welcome.

1405
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,800
- No, yeah like that's
never stopped you before.

1406
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:48,734
- Touche.

1407
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,700
Hey, at the risk of
overstepping, I just got to say,

1408
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:57,066
it's nice to see you
getting back out there.

1409
01:16:58,066 --> 01:16:58,734
- Stop.

1410
01:16:58,867 --> 01:17:00,166
- No really I'm serious,

1411
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,033
you've poured your heart
and soul into our kids,

1412
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:07,467
you deserve to be happy too
and Sam's one of the good ones.

1413
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,200
- I thought you didn't approve?

1414
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:14,133
- I've seen the
error of my ways.

1415
01:17:15,934 --> 01:17:19,333
- You don't think it'll be
confusing for the girls,

1416
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:22,300
Sam's gonna be their uncle
and if we start dating,

1417
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:25,834
what if it doesn't work out?

1418
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:29,266
- Yeah but what if it does,
how awesome would that be?

1419
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:43,734
- Hector, have you seen Sam,
I can't find him anywhere?

1420
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,533
- He left a little while ago.

1421
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:50,133
- Oh, did he say
when he'd be back?

1422
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:51,433
- Not to me, no.

1423
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:59,467
- You know, you look like
you could use some cocoa,

1424
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,266
would you like some cocoa?

1425
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,033
- Thank you but I'm sure
you're eager to get home,

1426
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,300
to your family.

1427
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:09,200
- Yeah, please tell Mia and
Sophie, I said Merry Christmas.

1428
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,667
- Merry Christmas.

1429
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,800
- Mia.

1430
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,367
- You're giving these to me?

1431
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,633
- They're hoops not posts so
you're gonna have to wait,

1432
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:49,266
until your ears are
completely healed to wear them

1433
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,200
but yes they're yours.

1434
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:56,166
- Thank you, thank you,
Sophie, look what mom gave me.

1435
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:00,100
- They're so pretty.

1436
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:01,266
- For me?

1437
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,867
- Wow, that's beautiful.

1438
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,133
- Go ahead and open it.

1439
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:17,300
- This way you will always
have them close to your heart.

1440
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,633
- I love it, thank you.

1441
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:27,233
- So, my dad told
me that Jeff called

1442
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:28,767
and asked for his blessing.

1443
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:32,266
- He's old fashioned that way.

1444
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,400
- I want you to know I had
no idea this was coming

1445
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:38,567
if I had I would have told Jeff,

1446
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,533
that he was going
about it all wrong,

1447
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,233
it's just this whole
business of calling my dad

1448
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:48,700
and asking for permission
when the only people,

1449
01:19:48,834 --> 01:19:50,867
he should've asked,

1450
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,233
the only ones whose
opinions really matter,

1451
01:19:54,467 --> 01:19:55,300
are you and the girls?

1452
01:19:56,967 --> 01:20:00,967
So, I sit here
before you asking,

1453
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:06,266
may I have your blessing
to join your family?

1454
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,900
- Okay, now you're
gonna make me cry.

1455
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:15,133
- I hope that's a good thing.
- oh, yes, of course.

1456
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:22,767
- So, we use wrapping paper
from every single person.

1457
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:26,533
- Well, that way you can
remember all the gifts you got.

1458
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:28,200
- A little piece
for me just fine,

1459
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,266
it's kind of like a mosaic.

1460
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,200
- Spoken like the daughter
of an art school alum.

1461
01:20:34,133 --> 01:20:36,567
- Don't even think
of touching these,

1462
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,233
Sam, made them and
they're out of this world,

1463
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,867
where is he, is he still asleep?

1464
01:20:42,867 --> 01:20:44,333
- I wouldn't know.

1465
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:45,367
- What do you mean?

1466
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:49,500
- I made a total fool
of myself last night,

1467
01:20:49,633 --> 01:20:51,667
searching the house
high and low for him

1468
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,533
and apparently he went out.

1469
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,934
- Well, I'm sure he's
got a good reason,

1470
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,300
here you want a bite?

1471
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,500
They're so good.

1472
01:21:15,934 --> 01:21:17,367
- Now she's the real deal.

1473
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,600
Girls, it's time for dinner.

1474
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:23,934
- Kate's making a roast goose,

1475
01:21:24,066 --> 01:21:25,300
she promised I
can help baste it.

1476
01:21:25,433 --> 01:21:28,500
- Oh, then we better
get you down there stat.

1477
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:37,600
- Sam, where were
you this morning?

1478
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:38,934
You missed all the presents.

1479
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:41,333
- Oh, I wanted to be
there Kiddo, believe me.

1480
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,600
How are my cinnamon rolls?

1481
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:45,300
- Way better than Upper Crust.

1482
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,033
- I ate two.
- Two.

1483
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,667
Listen, I brought you
guys some presents,

1484
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,233
they're in the great room
if you wanna go find them.

1485
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:54,166
- Yes, thank you.

1486
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:58,300
- You're staying for
dinner though right?

1487
01:21:58,433 --> 01:21:59,467
- Definitely.

1488
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,567
- Oh, thank you.

1489
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,000
Wow.

1490
01:22:16,133 --> 01:22:17,367
Are you gonna come down?

1491
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:22,400
- I'm not sure, you left
me hanging last night.

1492
01:22:25,367 --> 01:22:27,100
- I know, I'm sorry,

1493
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:34,367
I went to the
Butterfield this morning,

1494
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,200
the owners were having
breakfast with their family

1495
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,867
but I convinced
them to hear me out.

1496
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:43,834
- You did, how did it go?

1497
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:46,233
- Good I think
they love the idea

1498
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:47,533
of honoring the Inn's history

1499
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,667
and they flipped through deck,

1500
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,900
especially the picture of me

1501
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:53,567
and grandma Mary by the
gingerbread display.

1502
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,066
- You belong in that kitchen,

1503
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,467
they'd be crazy
not to choose you.

1504
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,200
- Well, they're not making a
decision till early January,

1505
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,800
so, it's a bit of a waiting game

1506
01:23:03,934 --> 01:23:07,600
but yeah, I feel
really good about it.

1507
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,533
I was an idiot for running
out of you last night,

1508
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:14,667
believe me I have been
regretting it all day.

1509
01:23:18,066 --> 01:23:19,433
- You missed the floor show,

1510
01:23:21,734 --> 01:23:24,266
I wore my classy
pajamas and everything.

1511
01:23:26,433 --> 01:23:28,467
- See now you're
just being cruel.

1512
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:35,900
My mom used to have a
locket like that, may I?

1513
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,333
They're lucky to have you.

1514
01:23:51,033 --> 01:23:53,233
And I left last night because
I didn't wanna make things,

1515
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:54,900
complicated for
you and the girls

1516
01:23:56,433 --> 01:23:57,934
but I couldn't let you leave
Aspen without telling you,

1517
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:02,567
how I feel about you, I
like you Maggie Collins,

1518
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,967
I like you a lot, I like
your candy cane microphone,

1519
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:13,200
I like your astonishing
lack of coordination

1520
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,467
and I'm pretty sure if
I was ever lucky enough,

1521
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,867
to see those classy
pajamas, I'd like them too.

1522
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,100
- Is that all?

1523
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:27,633
- As a matter of fact no
not only do I like you,

1524
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,166
I just really
wanna see you again

1525
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,000
and not just on Christmas.

1526
01:24:41,233 --> 01:24:42,800
Can I see you again?

1527
01:24:49,767 --> 01:24:52,367
(jazzy music)

1528
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,367
Does this mean I
get a second date?

1529
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,100
- I think that
could be arranged.

1530
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:23,567
- Do you want some
help with that?

1531
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,300
- Nope.

1532
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,266
- Smells awfully good in here.

1533
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,734
- You don't need to say that.

1534
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:36,233
What's this?
- Come on, open it.

1535
01:25:41,367 --> 01:25:44,967
- Mom's toffee with
the almonds on top.

1536
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,367
- It's all about
heat management,

1537
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,000
you've got to pour the
toffee on a cold marble slab,

1538
01:25:51,133 --> 01:25:53,200
and I then found
mom's in the basement.

1539
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,300
- Thank you.

1540
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,100
- Merry Christmas Kate.
- Merry Christmas Sam.

1541
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,166
- [Kate] Okay, you two,
it's time for dinner.

1542
01:26:07,734 --> 01:26:10,700
(indistinct chatter)

1543
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:18,767
(bouncy piano music)
