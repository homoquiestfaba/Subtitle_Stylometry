NEWS ANCHOR 1 [ON TV]:
Up next, the latest

56
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,698
from the town of
Slate River, which was

57
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,907
rocked again last night
by the brutal slaying

58
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,529
of one of its own.

59
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,497
NEWS ANCHOR 2 [ON TV]: I'm here
on the campus of Slate River

60
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,913
College, where the
body of Laurie Glaser

61
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:23,088
was discovered late last
night by the school's janitor.

62
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:24,952
Police are withholding
all information

63
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,851
as to the cause of
death, but all fingers

64
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,612
seem to point to the
Slate River serial killer.

65
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:32,650
Laurie Glaser would be
his fifth known victim.

66
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:35,342
Local authorities have promised
the denizens of Slate River

67
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,655
that the murderer will
soon be apprehended.

68
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,829
But till then, the
unspoken fear is

69
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,280
that the killer's four
month reign of terror

70
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,075
may well continue.

71
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:45,041

You better hope so, Grubeck.

119
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:04,871

in the murders?

Hold him.

127
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,710

I can't tell you that.

It's top secret.

156
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:13,560
Whatever, Jody.

179
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:54,419
So how do you feel, slugger?

180
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:55,696
Like a truck hit me.

181
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,977
Huh, pretty close, a floor
can pack quite a wallop.

182
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,702
Here, drink this.

183
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,639
So do you remember anything

00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:08,778
I think so.

185
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,402
I was coming down the
hallway to your office.

186
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:12,644
I turned the corner, and--

187
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,993
Mr. Grubeck.

188
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,753
Mr. Grubeck was
there in handcuffs.

will be for a very long time.

00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,562
What for?

191
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,219
Robin, there is--

192
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,668
oh.

193
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,947
There is evidence
linking Mr. Grubeck

194
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,190
to the death of Laurie
Glaser, and maybe all

195
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,468
of the Slate River killings.

196
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,506
Mr. Grubeck, how could he
be the Slate River Killer?

197
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:50,096
There was a witness, Robin.

198
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,925
Mr. Grubeck could
be the killer.

199
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,478
Easy now, easy now.

200
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,135
I want you to take it easy.

201
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,274
Relax.

202
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,690
I just can't believe it, Dad.

203
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,623
I used to work in his office.

204
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,522
He-- he never did
anything to me.

205
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,489
He-- he never even
raised his voice.

206
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:05,490
I know, honey.

207
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:08,735
It's a shock to all of us.

208
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:12,808
Look, we've all been through
a rough couple of months here.

209
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,432
But now, thank God, we
can all relax again.

210
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:17,917
Hm?

211
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,918
Come here.

212
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:22,404
[music playing]

213
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,036
TURRELL: You sure
he can't see me?

214
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,555
TAYLOR: Listen.
I told you 100 times.

215
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:37,764
He can't see you.
- The hell he can't.

216
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:38,661
Relax.

217
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,249
Relax.
- He saw me.

218
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,147
Hey, listen.
Calm down, slick.

219
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,458
It's a two-way mirror.

220
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:43,735
I don't give a damn
what you call it.

221
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,805
He just saw me.
- Ah--

222
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:45,875
He looked right at me.

223
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:46,911
Relax.

224
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,188
All right, I've had
it with this crap.

225
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:49,810
Are you ready to
make a statement?

226
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:50,708
Yes, I am.

227
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,542
The cuisine in
this establishment

228
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:01,615
tastes like second
rate dog food.

229
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,652
I hope you're taking
this down, young man.

230
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,930
Yeah, right.

231
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,312
DETECTIVE: Yeah,
that's very funny.

232
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,659
Now you listen to me, Grubeck.

233
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,281
We've got you down for
first degree murder,

234
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:13,869
and we've got a
reliable witness.

235
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,009
I take it you're talking about
the drunk on the other side

236
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:16,906
of that mirror.

237
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,118
His word will
stand up in court.

238
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:24,328
I doubt if his legs
would stand up in court.

239
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:28,366
Now, as much as I'm enjoying
this pleasant little chat,

240
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,368
I believe my lawyer
should be here.

241
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,266
Don't you?

242
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,787
Any way you want.

243
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,168
Thank you.

244
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:39,032
Dick.

245
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:43,312
And detective, I do believe
you owe me a phone call.

246
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,592
Get him the phone.

247
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:48,938
Stone, now.

248
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,395
You sure as hell are
going to need a miracle.

249
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,811
And I don't think God
owes you any favors.

250
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:02,366
Maybe God is not the only
one who works miracles,

251
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,781
sure as hell.

252
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,820
Three minutes.

MASTER OF THE DARK [ON
PHONE]: Out of the darkness

256
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,354
and into the light
comes your horrorscope

257
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,322
on this dark and stormy night.

258
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:32,361
Push 666 for your
horrorscope now.

259
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,536
Welcome to the caverns
of the unknown.

260
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,401
I am the Master of the Dark,
the guide to your destiny

261
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,611
on September 16.

262
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:43,407
Your powers are strong,
as is your will.

263
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,273
But there may be another
more powerful still.

264
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,896
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

265
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,967
I obeyed you.

266
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,865
I served you.

267
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,697
I will continue to obey you.

268
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,251
Are you going to answer me?

269
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:03,737
I said-- are you
going to answer me?

270
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:06,050
Answer me!

271
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:08,156
You will receive
the power that you

272
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:12,815
desire to fulfill your
purpose and feed your fire.

273
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:19,581
Prayers over, Grubeck.

274
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:24,206
[zap]

275
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,104
Ow!

276
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,796
Damn, what is with you, Grubeck?

277
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,752
They should lock him
up and cut off his mouth.

278
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:55,064
Harry said the police aren't
letting anyone near the house.

279
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,791
He's probably got bones and
knives buried in the basement,

280
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,310
like the one in Matamorris.

281
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,484
Mhm.

282
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,589
Anywhere you like, son,
long as you've got cash.

Come get it.

285
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,290
ANDY: All right.

286
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:24,853
Excuse me.

287
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,786
What's the story
with this place?

288
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,857
What do you mean?

289
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,376
Well, I mean, there's
hardly anybody here.

290
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,758
And in my vast experience,
that's usually not a good sign.

291
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,623
[laughs] Your vast experience?

292
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:38,970
What are you, the easy rider
or the galloping gourmet?

293
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:39,868
Both.

294
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:43,941
Here, try one.

295
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:51,845
Mm, average, very average.

296
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,883
Not nearly as tasty
as the company.

297
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,230
I'm Spike, Spike Jones.

298
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,369
I'm Robin, Robin Jamison.

299
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:03,547
I think you're
causing quite a stir.

00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, old habit of mine.

00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,280
Oh, my ride to the gym.

303
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,626
Yeah, just when
I was on a roll.

304
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:14,868
Nice to meet you, Spike.

305
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:17,699
Hey, you know, I could
give you a ride on my bike.

306
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:19,010
I'll take a raincheck.

307
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,150
Where does everybody
hang out around here?

308
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,151
Down Down at the point.

309
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,083
Maybe I'll see you.

310
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:23,981

receive the power that you
desire to fulfill your needs

316
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:29,667
and feed your fire.

317
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:30,565
Ah!

318
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,086
Ah!

[music playing]

322
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,299
So come have dinner with us.

323
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,921
What's the big deal?
- I know.

324
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,854
Listen, I promised my dad
I'd meet him later for dinner.

325
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,099
Was he running another
psychological profile or what?

326
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,032
I just think he's a
little worried about me.

327
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:34,896
BOTH: He's always
worried about you.

328
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,348
Listen, there's
something I've got to tell

329
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,488
you guys this afternoon.

330
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:41,523
Can you keep a secret?

331
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:42,421
Of course.

332
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:43,939
Depends.

333
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:47,909
This morning at the police
station, I saw Mr. Grubeck.

334
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:49,324
You saw him?

335
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,431
Yeah, I went to see my dad,
and I ran right into him.

336
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:53,639
Well, what did he look like?

337
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,295
Did he have blood and
guts all over him or what?

338
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,574
Shut up, Keith.

339
00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:00,231
And then he, like,
reached out and touched me.

340
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:01,509
Ew, he touched you?

341
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:02,648
Oh, what did it feel like?

342
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,339
Like, like warm, or was
it all cold and squishy?

343
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,236
God, stop it.

344
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,306
Ow.

ROBIN'S FRIEND: Sorry,
Robin, you'll have

346
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,378
to excuse Mr. Sensitivity here.

347
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:12,899
Look, Robin, I know how
you felt about the guy.

348
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:13,935
But he's just a creep.

349
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,213
You know, he always was a creep.

350
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:18,526
He's just some horny old pervert
who hid in the Dean's Office,

351

checking girls out through
the crack of his door.

You guys are bad.

00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:25,360
I gotta get going.
I'll see you later, OK?

- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

Yeah, later.

Hey man, nice bike.

361
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:23,176
Hey, I'm looking for a
girl named Robin Jamison.

362
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,212
She's over there.

363
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,835
She's coming this way.

364
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:27,836
Don't even think about it.

365
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,699
No problem.

366
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:33,946
Hey, Robin.

367
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:34,878
Hey, easy rider.

368
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:35,775
What are you doing here?

369
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,674
Do you have a second?

370
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:39,538
Sure.

371
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:42,092
Your father is the one
examining Steven Grubeck,

372
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:42,989
right?

373
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,784
I guess so.

374
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:47,166
He usually doesn't talk to me
about work, especially not now.

375
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:49,064
Why is that?

376
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:50,341
Well, you know Mr.
Grubeck's the dean

377
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:53,034
of my community college.

378
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:55,415
Yeah, I know.

379
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,315
I used to work in Mr.
Grubeck's office part time.

380
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,455
You know, everybody else
thought he was kind of scary.

381
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,975
But we always kind of got along.

382
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,390
Do you recognize this?

383
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:06,530
You left it at the diner.

384
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:10,258
Yeah, it fell out of a
magazine I was reading.

385
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,812
Did you call the number?

386
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,365
Me?
No way.

387
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:15,263
I hate this kind of stuff.

388
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,541
It's a joke, right?

389
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:19,060
No, Robin, it's no joke.

390
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,683
What are you talking about?

391
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:24,272
The horrorscope
cards, somehow they

392
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,894
get into the hands of
people who are in some kind

393
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:28,000
of trouble, who need help.

394
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:29,277
And so they start
calling this number,

395
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,693
and the line gives them
things, like answers

396
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:34,247
to their questions,
solutions to their problems.

397
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:35,835
And so they keep calling
the number, because all

398
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,734
of a sudden, they got
some sort of power

399
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,252
that they never knew they had.

400
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:41,047
[scoffs] You can't be serious.

401
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:42,359
No, I am.

402
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:43,774
I've tried it, and it works.

403
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,811
And somehow, I got away.

404
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:47,502
But this thing,
it possesses you.

405
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,642
And it starts to take you over
and starts to take control.

406
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:50,574
Spike, you're scaring me.

407
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:51,782
Look, I know
this sounds crazy.

408
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:53,094
But I've seen things.

409
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,752
I've had visions.

410
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:59,031
Spike, those visions,
I've had them too.

411
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,137
And I saw him kill Laurie.

412
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:03,725
And I'm afraid she's
not going to be the last.

413
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:21,536
Mhm, Ojo, and Manny, I
also want $2 on Beatlebaum.

414
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,780
Well, of course I got the money.

415
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,505
I'm doing pretty
good these days.

416
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:26,472
[knocking]

417
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,370
Just a minute.

418
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:29,889
Oh, hang-- hang on.

419
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,373
There's somebody at the door.

420
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:44,386
Oh, hi, Officer Nealon.

421
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,285
What'd I tell
you, Mr. Turrell?

422
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:47,424
About what?
Of

423
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,288
About unlocking the
door-- you're supposed

424
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,255
to ask who it is first.

425
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,705
I forgot.

426
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:53,913
Um, excuse me.

427
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,989
I got somebody on
the phone here.

428
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:03,509
Manny, you have to hang on
just a little while longer.

429
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:06,685
I-- I got some business.

430
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,928
I'm real sorry, but I--

431
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:10,930
I never been in this--

432
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:13,105
what do you call
this that I'm in?

433
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,934
Protective custody.

434
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:16,695
I've never done
it before, you see.

435
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:18,835
Well, after tomorrow, you'll
never have to do it again.

436
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,906
We want to keep you
in one piece, right?

437
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:21,803
Right.

438
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,218
I'm going for some food.

439
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:25,393
Would you like me to bring
something back for you?

440
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,635
That-- that would be nice.

441
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:29,431
I'll just have whatever
you're having, except no

442
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,675
red meat or fish.

443
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,470
I hate fish.

444
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,921
Um, I like chicken.

445
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:37,267
Chicken it is.

446
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,614
I'm leaving Officer Gross
here with you while I'm gone.

447
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,859
He'll be right outside.

448
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:44,723
Officer Nealon?

449
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,725
A bottle of wine might be nice.

450
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,454
White wine goes with chicken.

451
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:54,733
Any particular chateau?

452
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,080
No, as long as it's got a
picture of that funny looking

453
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:59,876
bird on it, it'll be fine.

454
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,394
A regular gourmet,
Mr. Turrell.

455
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,092
Manny, I'm going to
have to call you back.

456
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:11,197
I'm getting ready for dinner.

457
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:12,543
I'm having room service sent up.

458
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:26,799
Fancy hotel room, white
wine and chicken, Turrell,

459
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:30,078
you're a slick son of a bitch.

460
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:33,150
[SINGING] She's my
little sugar booger.

461
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:34,600
The boys, they all
want to hug her,

462
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:38,604
but she'll only
pucker up for me.

463
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,676
Dee, dee, dee,

464
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,781
Dee, dee-dee dee dee-dee.

465
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:49,132
What's the matter, Leonard?

466
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:52,963
You don't look happy to see me.

467
00:29:53,067 --> 00:30:16,297
[screams]

468
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,194
You son of a bitch!

469
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:35,764
Holy shit!

470
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:56,061
You forgot to flush.

471
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:57,027
[screams].

472
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:01,998
Help me!

473
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:02,964
Somebody!

474
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:09,212
Officer?

475
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:21,880
[inaudible] [screams]
You stay away from me!

476
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,812
[laughs]

477
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:30,992
No.

478
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:32,373
L'chaim.

479
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,270
No!

480
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:46,870
Let go of me!

481
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:50,598
Make sure you look both ways
before you cross, Leonard.

482
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:51,806
Oh my god, please let me go.

483
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,601
Please let me go I'm sorry.

484
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,879
I told them--

485
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:59,848
[horn honks]

486
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:00,849
Say cheese, Leonard.

487
00:32:06,925 --> 00:33:30,456
[screams]

488
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,354
Robin.

489
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:34,219
Robin.

490
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:45,230
Oh, Robin.

491
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:49,096
Hey.

492
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:50,028
Grubeck.

493
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,581
Grubeck, you asshole.

494
00:33:51,684 --> 00:33:52,478
Wake up!

495
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,416
Wake up, you son of a bitch.

496
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,531
Well, either you're
some kind of magician,

497
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:48,776
or you've got yourself a hell
of a partner on the outside.

498
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,123
Excuse me?

499
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:52,987
Leonard Turrell is dead.

500
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,644
Leonard Turrell.

501
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:57,819
Who is Leonard Turrell?

502
00:34:57,923 --> 00:34:59,166
You're not going to
get away with this.

503
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:00,546
Get up.
Come on!

504
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,514
Your sister is a freshman
at Slate River College.

505
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,963
So what?

506
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,552
Be nice to me, or I'll be back
in school before you know it.

507
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,313
Get out of here.

508
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,384
This ain't a joke, Susan, we
have this guy dead to rights.

509
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:18,357
Lemmish, I thought you
were disbarred last year.

510
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:20,325
Any charges of
misconduct on my part

511
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,396
were purely circumstantial.

512
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:26,089
The case was acquitted, and
my good name was restored.

513
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:27,228
That's a matter for debate.

514
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,925
Stephen?

515
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:35,823
Phil?

516
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:36,927
How did you sleep last night?

517
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:37,825
Like a prince.

518
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:42,174
When am I free to leave.

519
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:45,522
Well, I'm having a little
difficulty with that, Stephen.

520
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:48,076
Miss Lawler here seems to
be having a difficult time

521
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,492
absorbing the facts.

522
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,633
The fact, Mr. Lemmish, is that
your client is a prime suspect

523
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,566
in five serial murders.

524
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:56,015
The bottom line,
Stephen, is that,

525
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:58,259
under the present circumstances,
the prosecution is

526
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:00,365
bereft of any evidence against.

527
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:02,746
Leonard Turrell
most unfortunately

528
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,851
passed away last evening.

529
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,887
The cause of death
remains undeterred.

530
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:07,717
He was murdered, Mr. Lemmish.

531
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,374
He was run over by
a trucker who was so

532
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:11,030
tired he couldn't see straight.

533
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,273
That's what we know.

534
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:13,447
That's all we know.

535
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,725
Turrell was their only
link to implicating him.

536
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:18,037
I've beseeched the judge
to set bail, but the judge,

537
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:21,006
however, thanks to Mrs.
Lawler's persistent screeching,

538
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:23,422
Mr. Lemmish, please.

539
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,321
We have other evidence.

540
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,495
Blood and skin samples
found in the locker room

541
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,739
where Lloyd Glaser
was first assaulted.

542
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:31,913
Now I'm not going for
life imprisonment here.

543
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:33,639
I'm going straight
for the chair,

544
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:35,952
and I will see to it personally
that your client's stay

545
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:38,610
on death row is a brief one.

546
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:49,621
Good day, gentlemen.

547
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:52,451
Good day Mrs. Lawler,

00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:52,047
an unbiased professional
opinion would be more helpful.

729
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,842
You want to send
me to a shrink.

730
00:54:53,945 --> 00:54:55,361
I can't believe this.

731
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:56,810
Dad, I saw the woman
who was going to die.

732
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:57,777
I saw it.

733
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,054
And I knew it was
going to happen.

734
00:54:59,157 --> 00:55:00,366
And just because I
can't explain it,

735
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:02,022
you think I'm going
crazy or something?

736
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:03,886
No, I don't think
you're going crazy.

737
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,233
I believe you saw something.

738
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:07,614
And you're right,
I can't explain it.

739
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:09,306
Not now.

740
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:12,136
But as far as Grubeck
getting up out of his cell

741
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,623
and committing a murder, Robin,
what would you like me to say?

742
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:17,555
Just forget it, Dad.

743
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,385
Robin, where are you going?

744
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:20,455
Where am I going?

745
00:55:20,558 --> 00:55:21,904
I'm going to go out
and play in traffic,

746
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:23,078
talk to some parking meters.

747
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:25,045
You know, some good old
loony stuff like that.

748
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:26,633
I'll be sure to tell
you all about it.

749
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:28,946
Thanks a lot, Dad.

750
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:35,470
You know, the thing I
don't understand is why me?

751
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:37,989
I've never any kind of ESP
or anything like that before.

752
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:39,094
I don't know.

753
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:40,267
And all of the sudden,
I have this power,

754
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:43,547
and I don't know why.

755
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,962
I know the feeling.

756
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:48,241
I guess we're the lucky ones.

757
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,518
And Grubeck.

758
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:51,037
You know, I never, in a
million years, would've dreamt

759
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,211
he felt that way about me.

760
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:56,560
The guy is somehow channeling
all his bad energy towards you.

761
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:58,665
But the thing we've
got figure out

762
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:03,705
is, how does this guy get to be
in two places at the same time?

763
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:04,637
Wait a minute.

764
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,535
Take a look at this.

765
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,643
I found this in Grubeck's
office the other day.

766
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,817
Contact L's Astral Research.

767
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:15,337
What do you think?

768
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:16,614
I don't know.

769
00:56:16,718 --> 00:56:19,721
It sounds like it has
something to do with astrology.

770
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:21,274
What are you doing later?

771
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,827
Stay out of my dad's
away, for starters.

772
00:56:22,931 --> 00:56:24,208
You know, I think I'll
go over to Paula's.

773
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,072
Her parents are out of town.

774
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:27,487
I'll meet you
there at 10 o'clock.

775
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:28,385
Wait a minute.

776
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,558
Where are you going?

777
00:56:29,662 --> 00:57:41,009
I'm going to go contact L.

778
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:41,906
Excuse me?

779
00:57:46,014 --> 00:57:47,636
May I help you?

780
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,191
Yeah, I'm looking for a book
on out-of-body experiences.

781
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:54,298
There's over 300
such categories.

782
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:58,371
Can you be a bit more specific?

783
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,821
Well, you know,
something along the lines

784
00:57:59,924 --> 00:58:01,926
of the astral category.

785
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,376
You mean astral projection?

786
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,895
Yeah, exactly.

787
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:06,931
Then please walk this way.

788
00:58:07,035 --> 00:58:09,520
Lady, it takes years of
training to walk that way.

789
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:12,903
So um, what is it with
this place anyway?

790
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:14,042
What do you mean?

791
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:15,492
Well, I mean, you know,
the open till midnight,

792
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:16,527
and all this spooky stuff.

793
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:17,942
Is this some kind
of joke, or what?

794
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:20,151
We're a specialty
shop that deals

795
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:22,464
with delicate matters
of the occult.

796
00:58:22,568 --> 00:58:24,777
What did you expect, 7-Eleven?

797
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,331
So what's your specialty?

798
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:30,023
Do you have a preference?

799
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:31,611
Not at the moment, no.

800
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:33,406
You're very cute.

801
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:38,549
You kind of remind me of
a young Freddy Krueger.

802
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:42,208
You kind of remind me
of Elvira on steroids.

803
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,072
You say the sweetest things.

804
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,559
There's two important
facts to know when

805
00:58:48,663 --> 00:58:50,561
dealing with astral projection.

806
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:52,805
The first is that the
astral body is not a mirror

807
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:54,772
image of the physical one.

808
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,016
It is rather a
reflection of the soul,

809
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,191
of either its
beauty or depravity.

810
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,824
Hey.

811
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,207
The devil wins.

812
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:22,766
What's the second fact?

813
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:24,837
That a person may
release his astral self

814
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,152
during the state of sleep, or
under extreme duress or pain.

815
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:32,189
How much does this thing cost?

816
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:33,086
Come here.

817
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:42,889
I'll just do a
little browsing.

818
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:45,133
Well, you know, we'll be
closing in a couple of minutes.

819
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:49,171
So why don't you stick around
and grab something to eat?

820
01:00:13,713 --> 01:00:14,783
This is gross.

821
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:16,198
Can't we watch something else?

822
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,475
But we're getting
to the good part.

823
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:18,994
This is where the zombies
break into the house

824
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:20,237
and murder everybody.

825
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,758
The last thing I need
right now is a horror movie.

826
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:27,554
Hey look, they're showing
"It's a Wonderful Life" on PDN.

827
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:29,177
It's just a bunch of
dumb angels and stuff.

828
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,145
Besides, they run it 236
times every Christmas.

829
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:45,400
I don't think I can take
much more of this, Paula.

830
01:00:45,503 --> 01:00:46,608
But then we'll
miss the scene where

831
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:48,472
they eat the lady's guts--

832
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:50,819
which reminds me, I'm hungry.

833
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:54,478
I'll make some popcorn--
if we change the channel.

834
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:59,414

All right.

847
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:34,242
Besides, I have seen
this a few times already.

848
01:01:34,345 --> 01:01:35,484
I never would have guessed.

849
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:38,073
You hold down the fort,
and I'll grab some corn, OK?

850

Mr. Martini, how
about some wine?

851
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,323
This is so dumb.

852

853
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,683

907
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:30,503
[IN ROBIN'S
VOICE] Hello please,

908
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:35,267
my name is Robin Jameson
and I'm at 315 Pond Lane.

909
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:39,823
I just killed my best friend.

910
01:06:39,926 --> 01:06:41,790
I don't understand.

911
01:06:41,894 --> 01:06:43,758
Why are you doing this?

912
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:47,279
It's been a tragic
evening, Robin.

913
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:48,694
But who committed the murder?

914
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,153
Mr. Grubeck?

915
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:03,295
They'll take one
look at this place,

916
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,537
and when all is said
and done, they'll

917
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:06,781
come up with one answer.

918
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:08,058
You're unstable, Robin.

919
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:14,582
They'll lock you up in
your own little cell.

920
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:18,758
And then, every night, I could
be there with you, helping you

921
01:07:18,862 --> 01:07:20,726
through A your troubled time.

922
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:21,623
No!

923
01:07:25,144 --> 01:07:27,974
Stop!

924
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,460
He killed her.

925
01:07:30,563 --> 01:07:31,357
Jesus Christ.

926
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:34,671
Jesus Christ.

927
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:42,782
He came to a rather
sad end, didn't he.

928
01:07:42,886 --> 01:07:44,612
Unimaginative.

929
01:07:44,715 --> 01:07:49,858
There are so many more creative
ways to handle such matters.

930
01:07:49,962 --> 01:07:54,380
For instance, I
should be behind bars.

931
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:57,935
And indeed, I am.

932
01:07:58,039 --> 01:07:59,799
I'm going to kick
your ass, psycho.

933
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:09,464
You can't touch me.

934
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:11,087
But I can touch you.

935
01:08:15,781 --> 01:08:17,093
We'll meet again soon.

936
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:21,269
Scout's honor.

937
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:35,111
Let's get out of here.

938
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:36,008
Come on!

939
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:46,639
Hey killer.

940
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:49,677
I've got the skin cream
the doc ordered for you.

941
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,438
[laughs]

942
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:55,786
Sweet Jesus, your face
looks like a map of the moon.

943
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:59,100
Actually it more resembles
the biography of hell,

944
01:08:59,204 --> 01:09:01,965
[laughs] a region
you'll be familiarizing

945
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:03,000
yourself with soon.

946
01:09:05,762 --> 01:09:06,970
Now how are you
going to chase all them

947
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:09,041
young co-eds looking like that?

948
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,732
Crater face!

949
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:14,288
Ooh, I'll dazzle them
with my personality.

950
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:17,187
[laughs]

951
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:23,124
WOMAN [ON POLICE
RADIO]: 7 Adam 21.

952
01:09:23,228 --> 01:09:24,677
7 Adam 21.

953
01:09:24,781 --> 01:09:27,577
Two suspects may be in your
vicinity, one in connection

954
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,888
with a possible homicide.

955
01:09:32,513 --> 01:09:33,962
Spike, where are
we going to go?

956
01:09:34,066 --> 01:09:35,895
Nowhere.

957
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:38,622
Grubeck wants me, and there's
nothing I can do to stop him.

958
01:09:38,726 --> 01:09:40,106
Yeah there is--

959
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,005
we kill him.

960
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:43,696
What?

961
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,354
We kill him by getting
rid of his physical home.

962
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:49,564
The astral body dies
when the real one does.

963
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:50,462
But wait a minute, Spike.

964
01:09:50,565 --> 01:09:52,015
Grubeck's in jail.

965
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:53,810
Yeah, well as long as
we've got him locked up,

966
01:09:53,913 --> 01:09:55,777
we've got nothing
to worry about.

967
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,296
I'm going to lure
his spirit away,

968
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,125
and you take care of the body.

969
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,369
Spike, I don't know
if I could do this.

970
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:02,957
Look, as long as
he's chasing me,

971
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,235
you've got nothing
to worry about.

972
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:07,582
Oh Spike, I don't
know if I can do this.

973
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:13,554
I just want this to be over.

974
01:10:17,799 --> 01:10:21,320
You're the real
hero here, kiddo.

975
01:10:21,424 --> 01:10:22,218
I'll meet you at the point.

976
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:25,669
Let's go.

977
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,620
Hey, Grubeck.

978
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:47,588
Hey Grubeck!

979
01:11:00,014 --> 01:11:01,429
Come on out, psycho.

980
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:03,535
Let's have a little fun.

981
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:08,540
Now you can't have Robin, but
you sure as hell can have me.

982
01:11:08,643 --> 01:11:12,440
All right, if you insist.

983
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:49,926
Time to put the pedal to the
metal, as I believe the saying

984
01:11:50,029 --> 01:11:50,823
goes.

985
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,940
[horn honks]

986
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,714
Jody?

987
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:58,374
Jody?

988
01:12:58,477 --> 01:12:59,271
Is anybody here?

989
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:18,152
[horn honking]

990
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:20,603
[laugh]

991
01:13:31,165 --> 01:14:36,023
[horn honking]

992
01:14:36,126 --> 01:14:36,920
Jody?

993
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:55,145
[screams]

994
01:15:55,136 --> 01:15:56,552
Come on.

995
01:15:56,655 --> 01:15:58,036
Come to Daddy.

996
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,980
I've got something for you.

997
01:16:15,087 --> 01:16:20,506
[brakes screech]

998
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:21,956
Semper fi, hero.

999
01:18:07,372 --> 01:18:10,306
[screams]

1000
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:14,137
Now then, I was hoping
you'd come to visit.

1001
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:17,071
What did you do with Spike?

1002
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:21,524
Spike took a vacation
from the rest of his life.

1003
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:23,526
It's you and me now.

1004
01:18:23,629 --> 01:18:25,631
Now and forever.

1005
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:26,529
No!

1006
01:18:37,574 --> 01:18:41,924
[crying and weeping]

1007
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:30,766
[otherworldly sound]

1008
01:20:13,187 --> 01:20:14,085
Spike?

1009
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:15,569
Spike are you here?

1010
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:21,023
Spike?

1011
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:41,319
[cries]
- Such a nice view.

1012
01:20:41,422 --> 01:20:45,116
[screams]

1013
01:20:45,219 --> 01:20:47,601
I've got quite a bit
of suffering for you.

1014
01:20:47,704 --> 01:20:48,567
Stay away.

1015
01:20:48,671 --> 01:20:50,638
And still I suffer.

1016
01:20:50,742 --> 01:20:53,055
That's my tragedy, Robin.

1017
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:57,059
I could have any woman on
Earth, and yet I want you.

1018
01:20:57,162 --> 01:20:59,233
You want me
because you're dead.

1019
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:00,752
That's a very good point.

1020
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,755
And I'm in a
position to negotiate.

1021
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,861
So, I'll make you an offer.

1022
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:09,243
Your life for your love.

1023
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:10,210
No.

1024
01:21:10,313 --> 01:21:12,246
I can't and I won't!

1025
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:14,076
Reconsider.

1026
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:16,078
Tell me you love me, Robin.

1027
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:17,976
- No.
- I'll never tell anyone.

1028
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,874
No!

1029
01:21:18,977 --> 01:21:21,324
I love you, asshole.

1030
01:21:21,428 --> 01:21:23,809
Huh?

1031
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:26,260
[screams]

1032
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,714
Spike.

1033
01:22:08,854 --> 01:22:09,786
Dad, it was horrible.

1034
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,788
Could have killed all of them.

1035
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:13,790
I know, sweetheart.

1036
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:15,378
Sheriff and I just came
from the police station.

1037
01:22:15,482 --> 01:22:19,037
I just feel so badly.

1038
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:23,524
If I'd have just listened
to what you were saying,

1039
01:22:23,628 --> 01:22:25,941
maybe none of this
would've happened.

1040
01:22:26,044 --> 01:22:28,978
I'm just so terribly
sorry, sweetheart.

1041
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:29,875
Daddy.

1042
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:35,985
We just pulled Grubeck's
body off the rocks.

1043
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:38,298
Robin, do you have any
idea how he got there?

1044
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:39,747
Spike.

1045
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:41,439
He came to rescue me, then he
knocked Grubeck over the cliff.

1046
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:42,785
Spike is dead.

1047
01:22:42,888 --> 01:22:46,789
He bought it in a crash off
Route 39 over an hour ago.

1048
01:22:46,892 --> 01:22:48,170
Wait a minute.

1049
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:49,516
He lured Grubeck away.

1050
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:51,725
Who was luring who, Robin?

1051
01:22:51,828 --> 01:22:55,660
If Spike is dead, who was
it that killed Grubeck?

1052
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:57,282
I told you.

1053
01:22:57,386 --> 01:22:58,387
Don't say anything, Robin.

1054
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,422
Do you think--

1055
01:22:59,526 --> 01:23:01,010
Don't say anything.

1056
01:23:01,114 --> 01:23:02,149
Dad, do believe I did this?

1057
01:23:02,253 --> 01:23:03,702
You have the right
to remain silent.

1058
01:23:03,806 --> 01:23:05,014
Anything you say
can and will be held

1059
01:23:05,118 --> 01:23:06,015
against you in a court of law.

1060
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:07,534
Daddy, I didn't kill him.

1061
01:23:07,637 --> 01:23:08,466
Don't hurt her.

1062
01:23:08,569 --> 01:23:10,606
Daddy, I didn't kill anybody!

1063
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:12,090
Don't let them do this to me.

1064
01:23:12,194 --> 01:23:13,885
Daddy, Daddy, no!

1065
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:18,994
[muffled screaming]

1066
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:48,092
[phone ringing]

1067
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:52,924
[evil laugh]
