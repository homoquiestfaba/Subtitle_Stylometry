- Thank you, Mr. Burns.

31
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,629
Shakespeare, finally.

32
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,500
Really appropriate today, right?

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,812
Because he writes about all the things

34
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:05,496
that you might be feeling right now.

35
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,059
Really good.

36
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,642
Really nice choice.

37
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:10,497
Jonah.

38
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,719
You did bring something
to read, didn't you?

39
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,552
- Yes.

40
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:21,097
It's an excerpt from a novel
about the Beat generation

41
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:24,170
called The Other Side of Here.

42
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,420
It's by Samantha Carabinas.

43
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,667
Even those who thought they knew her

44
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,826
paint her as a simple girl.

45
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:36,341
The kind of woman who
smiled more than she frowned

46
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:39,326
and laughed more than she cried.

47
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,601
She was unaware of this
misconception about herself,

48
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,242
as most people are when
it comes to judging

49
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:49,031
how they are perceived by the
strangers they call friends.

50
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,701
When people think you're an open book,

51
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,978
they are less likely to
actually read the words

52
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,641
printed on the pages, and
this was never more true

53
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,391
than it was for Jane.

54
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:04,442
She was so simple and so
guileless she was a mystery.

55
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:07,545
And such a mystery that
everyone who thought

56
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:10,545
they had her figured out were wrong.

57
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,129
(clapping)

58
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,148
Very nice, Jonah.

59
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,615
Always refreshing to hear
anyone other than Kerouac

60
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,948
or Ginsburg from that school of thought.

61
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:27,625
Now Mr. Cooper, what have
you brought to celebrate

62
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,391
the final day of your high school career?

63
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:33,320
(upbeat rock music)

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,487
(moaning)

65
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,230
(chattering)

66
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:01,001
(moaning)

67
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,162
- What?

68
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:03,591
- Lucas, get the fuck out of here!

69
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,816
- On your best friend's
mama's bed, nice touch.

70
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,076
- Lucas.

71
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:08,803
Get the fuck out.

72
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,491
- Hey, you seen Sara or Troy anywhere?

73
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,429
- No, now get the fuck out of here!

74
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:13,823
- Oh, you want privacy?

75
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:14,983
- Get the fuck out.

76
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,899
- Hey, just let me know how my dick tastes

77
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,872
when you're done, all right man?

78
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,909
- Close the fucking door!

79
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,276
- What's the magic word?

80
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,109
- Asshole!

81
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,456
(chattering)

82
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,064
- Yo.

83
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:14,897
Jackass.

84
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,348
Have you seen Troy?

85
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:21,726
- In there, dude.

86
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,669
- Oh ya, you betcha.

87
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,768
You betcha, baby.

88
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:31,979
(gasps)

89
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,960
- Get the fuck in here and shut the door.

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,429
- Ooh.

91
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:39,466
- Love to play Santa, but
there is only enough for three.

92
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,488
- Yeah, looks like
somebody's had some already.

93
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:45,177
- I do not do drugs, Lucas, you fucker.

94
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,703
- The lady is always first.

95
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:48,482
- Yeah well, a lady doesn't
suck down four lines

96
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,027
that fucking fast, man.

97
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:50,860
(gasps)

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,759
- I was doing it for you, Lucas.

99
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,592
- Really?

100
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:53,425
- Yes, that's what friends do,

101
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:54,987
they look out for one another.

102
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,688
- Really, who told you we're friends?

103
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,938
- Oh, ouch, ow.

104
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,347
(fake crying)

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,392
All right.

106
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,433
We're going to the party.

107
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,266
- Mingle.

108
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,554
- Yes we must, come on.

109
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:08,387
- I've already been out
there, it's not worth it.

110
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:09,553
- It's last time.

111
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:13,583
- Wait, will you hold
on a second, I wanna...

112
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,301
(upbeat music)

113
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:18,718
(chattering)

114
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,450
(steady rock music)

115
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,359
- Sorry.

116
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,268
- You're Jonah.

117
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,540
- Yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,658
And you're Sara.

119
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,617
- We were in Miss Waters'
English class together.

120
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:23,718
I don't know, it's like
this weird coincidence.

121
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:24,728
- What is?

122
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,859
- The piece that you read.

123
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:29,750
Well my mom, she played Samantha Carabinas

124
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,750
in this cable movie about the Beats.

125
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:37,453
She was an actress, or she
is an actress still, kind of.

126
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,819
I guess.

127
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,874
- Well, I'll have to watch it.

128
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:45,525
- Yeah, don't bother,
it's kind of not so good.

129
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:47,247
- I'm sure I'd like it.

130
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,239
I'm a complete nut about
anything about those guys.

131
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,515
- Typical boy.

132
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:52,348
- Me?

133
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,515
- Yeah.

134
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,594
You know, into all those ultra cool,

135
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:58,223
hipster San Francisco writers.

136
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,122
- Oh, so I'm a cliche.

137
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:00,955
- Oh.

138
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:09,768
Yeah, I don't think I'd
say you were a cliche.

139
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,768
- Well, neither are you.

140
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:15,448
- Thank you.

141
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,401
- Water, baby girl.

142
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,808
- Oh, thank you baby.

143
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,058
Oh, Lucas, Troy, this is...

144
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:26,557
- Jonah.

145
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:27,390
Brand.

146
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,887
- You went to Hartwood?

147
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,804
- Yeah, we had American
history sophomore year,

148
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,062
and this year we had trig.

149
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:37,192
- Oh yeah, I remember you.

150
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,745
Back seat, third row, right?

151
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:40,742
- Cool, it's great to meet you, man.

152
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:42,550
Put her there.

153
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,863
Feel like going for a swim, dude?

154
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,885
- Lucas, don't be a dick,
just let him go, please.

155
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:46,939
- You hear that man?

156
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,189
She wants me to let you go.

157
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,306
Yo, what the fuck, man?

158
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,532
- [Troy] I'm sorry, I couldn't...

159
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,782
(laughing)

160
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,079
Very fucking funny.

161
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,964
(laughs)

162
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:20,615
- So, Jonah Brand of
the Cobra City Brands,

163
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:23,547
how'd you end up at this
little shindig, anyway?

164
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:26,118
- Everyone at Hartwood knew about it.

165
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:28,785
- Yeah, but everybody
wasn't invited, were they?

166
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:29,907
- I was.

167
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:31,163
- Really?

168
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:31,996
By who?

169
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:34,771
- Myself.

170
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,755
- You cold, kid?

171
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,382
- Not too bad.

172
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,084
- Those are some nice
jeans you got there, Jonah.

173
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:41,917
- Thanks.

174
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,700
- No, seriously, get yourself
a little knockoff top,

175
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,315
you'll have a whole fucking outfit.

176
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,131
- Shut up, don't listen to him, okay?

177
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,327
Everything's beneath Lucas
because he's so fabulous

178
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:51,717
and fantastic.

179
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,177
- Me and this kid wearing Van nines

180
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,200
like what, four days
ago we were hanging out,

181
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,772
it's not fabulous.

182
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,613
- Need I say more?

183
00:09:58,613 --> 00:09:59,910
- Whatever.

184
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,478
- Fuck this shit, let's go smoke.

185
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:03,380
- Yeah, good idea.

186
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,713
Coming, Pee Wee?

187
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:09,009
- No, I should probably be getting home.

188
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:12,535
- But--

189
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:13,368
- Damn, brother.

190
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,416
- It's not even midnight yet,

191
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,249
where you gonna go?

192
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,499
- I gotta work.

193
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,846
- We just graduated, you're supposed to

194
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:22,623
enjoy this last season in the sun.

195
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,033
- Exactly.

196
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,571
- Where do you work?

197
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:26,904
- At a pharmacy.

198
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,671
- Like a pharmacy pharmacy?

199
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,504
- Yeah.

200
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,303
- Nice job.

201
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,735
- It's really no big deal, I just

202
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:39,295
deliver prescriptions for people.

203
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,235
Like old people and stuff.

204
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,242
- Can you get benzos?

205
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,091
Because you know, if you take two benzos

206
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,314
and then you drink a glass of Merlot,

207
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,350
that's like the greatest
thing in the entire world.

208
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,797
- Yeah, especially if you do it

209
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,768
on the back of an eight
ball, it's fucking perfect.

210
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,199
- Or a vici-S.

211
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,428
That shit rocks.

212
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,514
- Yes, I love that, can you get that?

213
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,694
- I don't know, I--

214
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,349
- What, dude, like you never dip.

215
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:03,644
- Well, only if you can't get caught.

216
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,024
Right?

217
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:05,927
- Exactly.

218
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,844
So Jonah, what's your phone number?

219
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:10,968
- Mine?

220
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,080
- Yeah, your number, give it to me.

221
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,559
- Oh, okay, yeah, yeah,

222
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,392
310.

223
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,108
- Yeah.

224
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,143
- [Jonah] 555.

225
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,071
- [Lucas] 555, yeah.

226
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,583
- [Jonah] 4847.

227
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,750
- 4847, great.

228
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,289
Jonah Brand.

229
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,644
Who would've known you were so full

230
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,144
of endless possibilities, man?

231
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,135
(bird chirping)

232
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:36,968
(dog barking)

233
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,551
- Morning honey.

234
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:39,979
- Morning.

235
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,749
- [Mom] How'd you sleep?

236
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:42,749
- All right.

237
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,421
- Oh.

238
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:49,754
You know they had a bomb
threat at LAX this morning?

239
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,964
- How would that matter to us?

240
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:58,338
We haven't left this
city since we moved here.

241
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:00,923
- Couldn't, it was Hartwood.

242
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,090
- Not my idea.

243
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,484
Public would've been fine by me.

244
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:09,067
- And you'd be fine
with community college.

245
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,343
Oh, okay.

246
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:15,266
Then I won't worry about
taking a second mortgage

247
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,683
for your tuition.

248
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:21,699
- No mom, I want to go to UCLA.

249
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,026
Okay?

250
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:23,859
Thank you.

251
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,407
- All right.

252
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,074
(phone ringing)

253
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,108
I'll get it.

254
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,165
Hello?

255
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,583
Stephen.

256
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:40,901
No no no, it's okay, I'm glad you called.

257
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,000
Tonight?

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,803
I'm working nights all week,

259
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,232
but this weekend would be good.

260
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:51,717
- It must be so awesome.

261
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,148
- What?

262
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,575
- Not having to go to stupid
high school ever again.

263
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:01,075
God, it's like the worst
part in anyone's entire life.

264
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:06,006
I bet Hartwood was pretty cool, though.

265
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:08,573
- For some people.

266
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,189
- Yeah.

267
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,522
You have to be really smart to go there.

268
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,502
And you're really smart.

269
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:26,097
Know where you're going to college yet?

270
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,612
- UCLA.

271
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:28,854
- Oh.

272
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:33,478
- Claire, Jonah has three
more deliveries before noon.

273
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,597
- Dad, we were only talking.

274
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,164
Don't be such an asshole.

275
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,285
- Mrs. Hanlin called
me twice this morning.

276
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,560
Could you drop off her
prescription on your next run?

277
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,643
- No problem.

278
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,680
- Hey, you know I was thinking.

279
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,908
After you start school, if
you want to stay on that is,

280
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,348
we could try adjusting deliveries

281
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:52,699
around your class schedule.

282
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,006
Had to work my way through college myself.

283
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:57,423
- That'd be cool.

284
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:05,227
(upbeat rock music)

285
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,309
Fuck!

286
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,781
(phone ringing)

287
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:53,614
Hello?

288
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:55,076
I mean, (clears throat) what up?

289
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,063
- [Lucas] Jonah.

290
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:56,896
It's Lucas.

291
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,729
Bring us drugs.

292
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:01,311
So, what you up to this
Thursday afternoon?

293
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:03,674
- You know, just chilLing.

294
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,135
- [Lucas] Well we're
hanging poolside at Sara's

295
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,266
if you want to come by,

296
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,237
grace us with your latest
Cobra City couture.

297
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:09,883
- Right, right.

298
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:11,911
I just got a few things
to do around the house

299
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,382
and then I'll be right over.

300
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:16,956
- [Lucas] Outstanding Brand, outstanding.

301
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:17,844
- All right.

302
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:21,052
(upbeat rock music)

303
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:21,885
Later.

304
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:35,267
- Think I should get a nose job?

305
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,050
- Erin, please, come on,

306
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,818
you know your nose is adorable.

307
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,901
- Yeah, but this magazine

308
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:47,353
says that a man looks for
symmetry in a woman's face.

309
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:51,693
It says that your lower lip

310
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:56,693
should be exactly 20%
larger than your upper lip.

311
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,043
Which means I need a nose job,

312
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:02,126
because if you'll look at me, please,

313
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:08,135
my left eye is obviously
closer to my right eye.

314
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,885
- Okay, stop talking, let me see.

315
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,227
No, your nose is perfect.

316
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,282
- Really?

317
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:20,177
- Yes, Erin, and you shouldn't even be

318
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,045
reading that thing anyway, it's biased.

319
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:24,378
A cosmetic surgeon wrote it.

320
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,593
(giggling)

321
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,426
Go away.

322
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,365
- Thank you.

323
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:34,031
- No.

324
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,499
(upbeat rock music)

325
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,817
(doorbell rings)

326
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,142
- What'd you fall into a
fucking well or something?

327
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:51,975
- [Jonah] No.

328
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:53,498
- Shut up and let me see what
you got, what did you bring?

329
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:55,755
- [Jonah] I couldn't get anything.

330
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:57,683
- Are you fucking kidding me?

331
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,263
- [Jonah] No.

332
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,738
Well I, no, I think...

333
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:03,756
But I think I found a way to get some.

334
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,183
- Good, not a moment too soon.

335
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:07,016
Come on.

336
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,981
What do you think of the digs?

337
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,398
- It's all right.

338
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,088
- You want a beer?

339
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:20,547
I'm gonna grab a beer.

340
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,347
Yeah, let's have a beer
while our hostess explores

341
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:25,597
the limits of good taste in the garden.

342
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:35,068
- Hey, shouldn't we tell them
that I'm here or something?

343
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,158
- Heel Rover, okay?

344
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:36,991
They know.

345
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,508
The question is do they give a shit.

346
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:41,520
- I think Sara might.

347
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,437
- I think she wouldn't.

348
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,424
Don't you remember her freshman year,

349
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:48,065
she was quite the wanton whore?

350
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:51,792
- Lucas, they can seriously be so tedious.

351
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,610
- Then why the fuck are you
out there watching them?

352
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,990
- I don't like to watch, Lucas.

353
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,740
You oughta know that.

354
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,853
I'm Erin.

355
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:03,959
- Oh, right.

356
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,479
Erin, this is Jonah, Jonah, this is Erin.

357
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:08,459
- Oh yeah, you were that kid that got

358
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,704
thrown into the pool, right?

359
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:12,308
- Yeah, yeah, and you're the girl

360
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:15,159
that was upstairs at the party.

361
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,065
(chuckles)

362
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:18,838
- Someone here has a big fucking mouth.

363
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:19,987
- It's not as big as--

364
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:20,959
- Lucas.

365
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:21,792
- What?

366
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:24,823
- Can you pour me a fucking
drink please, so I can leave?

367
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:25,804
- What are you talking about,

368
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,484
I thought you were coming
to Joseph's with us tonight?

369
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:29,937
- Nope, Darren Zaft is
taking me to dinner.

370
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:31,084
- Really.

371
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,540
Darren Zaft, huh?

372
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,499
He's such a nice Jewish boy, that one,

373
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:35,686
he's a real fucking mensch.

374
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,685
- How about just give
me the fucking drink.

375
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:38,818
- What do you think I'm doing?

376
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,651
Here.

377
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:45,904
- Nice to meet you.

378
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:47,987
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

379
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,804
- A barrel of fucking sunshine, right?

380
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,933
- Hey Jonah, what's up?

381
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:54,766
- Hi.

382
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,683
- How you doing, buddy?

383
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:01,739
Let's smoke pot.

384
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,119
- Okay.

385
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,776
I don't want you guys to make fun of me

386
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,311
but I've been thinking,

387
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,879
and I've decided that I
am going to do something

388
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,615
different and important with my life,

389
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:16,973
like travel to far away
places and help needy people.

390
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,448
- What the fuck are you talking about?

391
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:20,916
Like you're honestly gonna be able to feed

392
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,116
starving stick children with
fucking dysentery gruel?

393
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:26,695
- Well, I wouldn't feed
them gruel, retard,

394
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:30,794
I'm gonna feed them something
good, like strawberries.

395
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,225
- Yeah please, the fucking
lack of Starbucks alone

396
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,802
would have you on the first flight back.

397
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,436
- You wouldn't go there
in the first place.

398
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,110
- Dude, you wouldn't go
in the first place either,

399
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,943
what are you talking about?

400
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,013
- Yeah, no shit, man.

401
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,473
Encino's as third world as I'll journey.

402
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,347
- My god, you guys are so fucking--

403
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:46,275
- Smart?

404
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:47,108
- Yeah, smart.

405
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:49,981
No, you're selfish and you're assholes.

406
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,981
- Well, my selfish soul,

407
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,363
(speaking gibberish)

408
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,189
is rescuing you from your
strawberry philanthropy

409
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,865
and taking you straight to Europe

410
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:06,198
for a year's worth of (whispering)

411
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,672
- My white knight.

412
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,695
- Yeah, that's all contingent on the fact

413
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:12,070
that you may not even
get into Brown, remember?

414
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,903
Smart ass?

415
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:17,137
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna get in.

416
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:22,263
If I can impress the hell out of them.

417
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,933
- I cannot believe that they
are flying you out there

418
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,827
for an interview, that's
like the stupidest thing

419
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:26,837
I ever heard.

420
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:28,120
- It's fucking Brown, all right?

421
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,751
It's not UC Berkley, what do you expect?

422
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,589
- Berkley is a good school.

423
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,656
- Yeah well, it may be good,

424
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,991
but it's not good enough for Troy Daniels

425
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,063
of the California
Constructions Daniels here.

426
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:41,670
No see, only the most esteemed Ivy league

427
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,808
east coast schools are good
enough for our boy here.

428
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:44,723
Isn't that right?

429
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,625
- Not if I don't get
through this interview.

430
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,458
- Shh.

431
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,499
You are going to be brilliant.

432
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,551
- Yeah, he's always brilliant.

433
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,884
Brilliant fucking brilliant.

434
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,637
Shit yo, it's like nine, we
should probably be going guys.

435
00:20:57,637 --> 00:20:59,325
- Wait, where are you guys going?

436
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,158
- Joseph's.

437
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,444
Chevo is spinning tonight.

438
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:02,416
You should come with us.

439
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,797
- Whoa, hey, easy, easy fellas, okay,

440
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,797
let's not go crazy here.

441
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,926
And I'm not trying to be a dick here,

442
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:11,183
but the kid's been smoking
our weed, drinking our beer

443
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,849
all friggin' day, I just think it's time

444
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:14,009
for a little reciprocation.

445
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,967
- Shut up, okay, of course
you can come with us.

446
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,800
Now, I am going to go get dressed.

447
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:24,819
Jesus.

448
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,069
(chuckles)

449
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:29,224
I am all right.

450
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,585
- [Troy] All right.

451
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,676
- I have money.

452
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,334
- Oh you have money?

453
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,532
Oh that's great man, what
did your mom give you what,

454
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,145
a raise in your allowance?

455
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:44,257
Hey look dude, come here, come on.

456
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:46,673
It's all copacetic, okay?

457
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,710
But I just think it's time
you chipped in a little bit,

458
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,628
you know?

459
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:51,950
And I figured you got this job,

460
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,325
why not share the wealth, you
understand what I'm saying?

461
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:56,041
- Yeah, yeah.

462
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,727
- Because we try to help
each other out, you know?

463
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:59,745
Friends help friends help friends,

464
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:01,592
and we're all friends, right?

465
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,653
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're definitely friends.

466
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,651
- Great, great, great.

467
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:09,307
Okay, now, you know I'm not asking

468
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,548
for the world here, right?

469
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:12,790
It's just a little taste, a
little something something.

470
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,558
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

471
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:15,558
- Great man.

472
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,332
- [Troy] See you later, Jone.

473
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:20,781
- Yeah, thanks Troy, later.

474
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:21,660
Hey.

475
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,493
- Yeah?

476
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:23,750
- Tell Troy I said goodbye.

477
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,711
- Oh yeah yeah yeah, you got it.

478
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,017
- No, not Troy, Sara.

I don't where Troy got it
but it's fucking garbage,

512

I'm flushing the shit out with vodka.

- They're fucking.

517
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:24,099
- Or both, my guess is both.

518
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,225
You want a drink?

519
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:26,876

520
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,764
- Hey, who would you rather
fuck, Britney or Jamie Lynn?

521

522
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,923
The little sister, right?

523
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:33,756
- Yeah.

524
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:35,694
- Oh, her, all fucking day, any day.

525
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,530
- Why?

526
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,743
- She's fucking cleaner
probably, you know?

527
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:39,257
She's young.

528
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:42,730
- Tiny vaginy makes your dick feel big.

529
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,196
Lucas, get your shit together.

530
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:47,936
- Fuck, this fucking crap coke.

531
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,769
- I might have something for that.

532
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,840
- What the hell is that?

533
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,590
Oh yo, thank you so fucking much.

534
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:05,293
What?

535
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:07,290
- Well, they're for everybody.

536
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,113
- Yeah, well, fuck
everybody, Jonah, all right?

537
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:10,582
Trust me on this one, you get me all

538
00:27:10,582 --> 00:27:11,803
amped on fucking bad coke,

539
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:13,541
I'm seriously gonna shoot
you in the fucking face.

540
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:14,684
- That's actually true.

541
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,642
- I know a thing or two about
a thing or two, all right?

542
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:17,504
- Jonah!

543
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,167
- Jonah, my man.

544
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,101

You should go for her.

- Where did you meet this guy, anyway?

730
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,366
- I didn't.

731
00:35:10,366 --> 00:35:11,728
Troy did.

732
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:13,561
Surfing, it sounds like.

733
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:16,100
- Oh god, another surfer.

734
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,663
Breeding sounds impeccable.

735
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:19,706
Is he cute?

736
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:20,771
- How the fuck should I know?

737
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:21,699
I haven't met him yet.

738
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,551
- Well if he's not, someone there is,

739
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:25,416
and they are going to loan me dick.

740
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,481
(laughs)

741
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:29,083
- Well you know, if you really need it,

742
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,906
I'm always here for you, Rin.

743
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:32,837
- I'll never be that desperate again.

744
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:34,869
- Uh uh, never say never.

745
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,168
- Never fucking ever.

746
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,291
- Ever fucking never.

747
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,356
- Double never fucking ever.

748
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,995
- Jesus, you don't have
to be so harsh about it.

749
00:35:41,995 --> 00:35:44,092
- Truth hurts, tiny.

750
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:45,633
- Who the fuck you calling tiny?

751
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:46,861
- This one.

752
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:47,861
- Very cute.

753
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:54,405
Gimme a pill.

754
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:56,213
- I only have a few left.

755
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,046
- So what?

756
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,294
Give me one.

757
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,118
- So I promised Sara that
I would give her some

758
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:02,201
when we got to the party.

759
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:05,519
- When did you talk to Sara?

760
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,436
- I called her after you called me.

761
00:36:09,674 --> 00:36:10,507
- Oh shit.

762
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,480
Jonah, I seriously think you should

763
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,029
probably try and get yourself
a little trim tonight

764
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:17,540
at this party, okay?

765
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,373
- [Erin] Yeah.

766
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:19,361
- Wait, what do you mean?

767
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:22,022
- He means stop jerking off to Sara

768
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:24,281
and find your own fucking pussy.

769
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,346
(chuckles)

770
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:28,001
- Yeah, well I wasn't gonna
say it like that, but yeah.

771
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:29,622
- My way's funnier.

772
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:32,046
- And it's probably not
a good idea to call her

773
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:34,503
while Troy's at Brown this weekend either.

774
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:35,503
- Seriously.

775
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:38,201
- You guys are assholes.

776
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:40,118
- Dude, I'm not holding
it against you man, okay?

777
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:43,327
All I'm saying is that jerking off to Sara

778
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,473
is as close as you're
gonna get, all right?

779
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:46,891
Buy some tissues.

780
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,026
(Erin laughs)

781
00:36:48,026 --> 00:36:49,080
- I don't do that.

782
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,304
(laughing)

783
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:52,387
- Yeah right.

784
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:56,191
Look at his hand like
frozen in the position.

785
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:58,391
(laughs)

786
00:36:58,391 --> 00:36:59,757
- Yeah, and this is coming from the chick

787
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:02,861
that fucking fell asleep while
using her battery operated.

788
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:04,073
- Lucas.

789
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:05,317
- Didn't you get like a yeast infection

790
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:06,344
from that or something?

791
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:07,177
- I was drunk.

792
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:08,010
Can you shut up?

793
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,843
He's lying.

794
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:10,051
- We seriously shouldn't be in
the same car with this chick.

795
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:11,429
- Have you no restraint?

796
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,090
- Not when it comes to yeast infections.

797
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,590
- [Erin] Fuck you.

798
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,217
- Yo, Jonah, do me a favor though?

799
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,695
- Yeah.

800
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:23,213
- When we get to the party,
we're gonna go in first,

801
00:37:23,213 --> 00:37:25,925
just wait like five
minutes before you come in.

802
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:28,061
You know, so we don't get all crowded,

803
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:30,728
you know, we can have our space.

804
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:33,151
You get it, right?

805
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:35,212
You know what I mean?

806
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,495
- Yeah.

807
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:37,328
- Good.

808
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,733
(hip hop music)

809
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,079
- What the fuck...

810
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,459
Who the fuck are you?

811
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:07,626
- Who are you?

812
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:11,494
- I'm the guy whose
house you're partying in.

813
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,979
- Oh,

814
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:14,562
sorry, Danny right?

815
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:21,133
- Do I know you?

816
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,883
- No, no, I'm a friend of Troy's.

817
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,609
- Troy?

818
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:27,442
- Yeah.

819
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,304
- Oh, yeah, I got you homes, yeah.

820
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:34,748
Dude's fucking dope on a board.

821
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:35,581
- Excuse me?

822
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,476
- He's a shredder.

823
00:38:37,476 --> 00:38:39,550
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

824
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,717
I hear he's very talented.

825
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,135
- Hey Jonah.

826
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:06,938
- Hey.

827
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,433
You danced really well.

828
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:14,266
(laughs)

829
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,099
- Yeah.

830
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:19,976
How come you're not getting
out there, Jonah Jone?

831
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:24,007
- I don't know, I don't
feel like it I guess.

832
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:26,008
- You're so funny.

833
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:27,091
- Why's that?

834
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:30,366
- I don't know, it's like

835
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:32,544
you're two different people sometimes,

836
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:34,443
or something.

837
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,156
Like tonight you're quiet,

838
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:38,656
but at karaoke you were crazy.

839
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:44,081
- Which one do you like better?

840
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:46,692
- I don't know.

841
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,865
- Excuse me, excuse me.

842
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,615
Hey man, you thirsty?

843
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:05,265
- Thanks.

844
00:40:05,265 --> 00:40:07,182
- All right, all right.

845
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:09,686
You having fun?

846
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:12,540
- Sure.

847
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,397
- Hey, you liar.

848
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:17,993
- We gotta hit the hay, baby girl.

849
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:18,826
- Okay.

850
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:29,625
- Ooh.

851
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,450
See, now that is what I love about Sara.

852
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,607
I might not get to bang her,

853
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:37,386
but she's gold about
giving it away, you know?

854
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:38,719
Take some notes.

855
00:40:57,202 --> 00:41:00,035
(loud rock music)

856
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,600
- Lucas.

857
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,041
- You okay, man?

858
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:38,028
(chattering)

859
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:38,916
- Come on.

860
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,564
Almost to the car.

861
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,040
- [Lucas] You need to
find you a new boyfriend.

862
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,017
- [Sara] I know.

863
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:44,059
- [Lucas] This one's broken.

864
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,062
- He's broken.

865
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:46,395
You're so heavy.

866
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:55,359
- Whoa, watch your head, watch your head.

867
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,193
(laughing)

868
00:41:58,193 --> 00:41:59,026
All right.

869
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,741
Here, give me your hand.

870
00:42:01,741 --> 00:42:04,100
You take this, you call me if
you need anything, all right?

871
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,977
Lay back and try and get some
sleep, you'll feel better.

872
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:06,977
- All right.

873
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:10,836
- Bye.

874
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,431
I love you.

875
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,591
I'll see you in the morning.

876
00:42:13,591 --> 00:42:14,766
- Okay.

877
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,314
- Let's go see if that
chick has a friend, man.

878
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,153
Try and get you laid.

879
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,556
- Well...

880
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:22,852
You think someone should stay with him?

881
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:24,001
- Right.

882
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,767
Watch one of your boys sleep
or go get my balls licked,

883
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,506
that's a tough question.

884
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:30,089
You're on your own.

885
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:42,531
- Hey Troy.

886
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:44,364
Are you gonna be okay?

887
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:46,849
- Fuck you, man.

888
00:42:49,764 --> 00:42:51,303
- All right.

889
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,818
Hey, watch your feet.

890
00:42:52,818 --> 00:42:54,491
- All right.

891
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,408
Thanks man.

892
00:42:56,986 --> 00:42:57,819
- Yeah.

893
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:01,338
- [Sara] Jonah Jone.

894
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:03,478
Jonah Jone!

895
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:13,946
(steady dance music)

896
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:57,827
(doorbell rings)

897
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,117
(crying)

898
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:06,284
(screams)

899
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:16,059
(siren wailing)

900
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,650
(banging)

901
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:34,567
- Sara come on, open the goddamn
door, we're gonna be late.

902
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:38,198
- I'm almost ready.

903
00:44:38,198 --> 00:44:39,891
- Look, I don't care what you're
doing in there, all right,

904
00:44:39,891 --> 00:44:44,558
just finish it up and get out
here, everybody's waiting.

905
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:00,447
- Okay, just two more seconds.

906
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:04,197
- You said that 20
minutes ago, now hurry up.

907
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,359
What the fuck are you doing here?

908
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,583
- I was just driving by and...

909
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,382
- Didn't I tell you we'd
meet you at the funeral?

910
00:45:10,382 --> 00:45:11,584
- Yeah.

911
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:16,584
I don't know, I saw your car
so I thought I'd stop and...

912
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:18,367
- She won't come out.

913
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:23,509
- Hey Sara, it's me Jonah.

914
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:29,966
Hey, listen, you can ride with me

915
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:32,648
to the funeral if you'd like.

916
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:34,648
- What the fuck is that?

917
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:43,936
- Sara, please just get out here, okay?

918
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:45,055
It's not gonna take that long,

919
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:47,722
but we gotta do this, all right?

920
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,050
- Hi.

921
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:13,270
- How did you get up there?

922
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,103
- I flew.

923
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:19,682
Or I just used your mom's window.

924
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:20,682
- I'm trying

925
00:46:22,003 --> 00:46:23,086
to get ready.

926
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,698
Lucas

927
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:29,411
is banging on the door

928
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,140
and he's rushing me.

929
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,807
I'm not finished with my makeup,

930
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:37,213
and I can't find my ring.

931
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:39,296
I don't really want to go

932
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,423
unless I have...

933
00:46:53,832 --> 00:46:54,665
Thank you.

934
00:46:58,511 --> 00:46:59,526
(banging)

935
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:00,862
- [Lucas] Enough already.

936
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:02,862
Let's go, Sara, come on.

937
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:23,015
- Your resourcefulness is
fucking annoying sometimes.

938
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,789
(birds chirping)

939
00:47:34,638 --> 00:47:36,888
- I'm gonna go talk to her.

940
00:47:38,185 --> 00:47:40,185
- Sweetie, you're sorry.

941
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:42,245
- No I'm not.

942
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:45,739
- [Erin] Sara.

943
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:48,687
- You know, maybe you should wait.

944
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:51,804
You know, until after the reception.

945
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:54,554
- I'm not going to the reception.

946
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,281
(chattering)

947
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,386
Mrs. Daniels?

948
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:16,086
I wanted you to know...

949
00:48:17,221 --> 00:48:18,388
I wanted to...

950
00:48:24,144 --> 00:48:25,727
- Why are you here?

951
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:27,735
- Excuse me?

952
00:49:07,762 --> 00:49:09,371
God.

953
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:11,681
I should've listened to you.

954
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:15,362
I can't believe that I
talked to his mom like that.

955
00:49:15,362 --> 00:49:16,711
- She didn't know what she was saying.

956
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:19,201
- She knew what she was saying.

957
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:20,290
- Lucas.

958
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,123
- What?

959
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:27,146
Fuck her anyway, she was (mumbling)

960
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:28,915
- No she didn't.

961
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:30,344
- Sara.

962
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:33,305
In his mom's eyes, Troy could
do no wrong, you know that.

963
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,888
- Come on Lucas, all
parents are like that.

964
00:49:38,246 --> 00:49:39,163
- Not mine.

965
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,288
- Thank you.

966
00:50:07,616 --> 00:50:10,699
I think that we should go over there.

967
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:13,218
- Why would we go--

968
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,944
- I think that we should apologize.

969
00:50:15,944 --> 00:50:17,015
- Apologize for what?

970
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:18,669
We didn't do anything wrong.

971
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:20,760
- We didn't do anything?

972
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,907
What the fuck are you talking about?

973
00:50:22,907 --> 00:50:24,582
We were all with him, Lucas.

974
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:26,000
We put him in the car.

975
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,089
- No, Troy did that to
himself, you know that.

976
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:29,765
- Well we didn't have
to put him in the car.

977
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,708
- He didn't have to get
so fucked up, now did he?

978
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:32,941
- What are you talking about?

979
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:34,637
He was your best friend.

980
00:50:34,637 --> 00:50:36,122
- You don't think I know that?

981
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:37,812
- Well you're not really acting like it.

982
00:50:37,812 --> 00:50:39,377
- How the fuck am I supposed to act?

983
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:41,857
- I don't know, but you're
not supposed to act like this.

984
00:50:41,857 --> 00:50:42,690
- Hey!

985
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:44,775
Hey.

986
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,682
(sighs)

987
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:01,896
- Sara, I'm sorry, okay?

988
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:03,412
Just...

989
00:51:03,412 --> 00:51:04,300
Don't listen to me,

990
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,686
I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about, all right?

991
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:07,456
- I'm sorry too.

992
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:10,456
(crickets chirping)

993
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,407

00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:26,771
- She was, but now her
and some of the cast

1009
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:29,271
are going to St. Martin
when the shoot's done.

1010
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,104
- Hmm.

1011
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:34,932
What'd she say about Troy?

1012
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:40,254
- She wants me to fly to
the set to be with her.

1013
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:42,892
- You should.

1014
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:46,907
- I don't know.

1015
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:51,826
There'll be all those people around.

1016
00:52:51,826 --> 00:52:53,993
None of them would know...

1017
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:00,723
I don't know, they'd all be
partying, it's just stupid.

1018
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:02,663
- [Man] Sara Weller?

1019
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:03,496
- Yeah?

1020
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:09,238
- I'm Phil Heckwith, I'm a
friend of the Daniels family.

1021
00:53:09,238 --> 00:53:11,232
Sure hope you girls are using a sunscreen

1022
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,149
with a high SPF rating.

1023
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,603
I use 75 myself.

1024
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:18,388
At my pool, at a beach.

1025
00:53:21,162 --> 00:53:21,995
Clarence.

1026
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,067
Never heard of it.

1027
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,324
- Yeah, that's 'cause it's from Barney's.

1028
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:27,157
- Good.

1029
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:27,990
I like Barney's.

1030
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,823
- Yeah, I can tell.

1031
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:29,656
- Erin.

1032
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:31,121
- What?

1033
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:32,278
- Just come on.

1034
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:35,512
- Look, I was sorry to hear about Troy.

1035
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,773
I didn't know him, but from
what his parents told me,

1036
00:53:37,773 --> 00:53:39,953
he was a hell of a kid.

1037
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:42,246
- Well how do you know his parents?

1038
00:53:42,246 --> 00:53:44,319
- I'm sort of an employee.

1039
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,747
Hired to find out about his passing.

1040
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:48,906
- Find out what?

1041
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:50,070
- Oh, you know.

1042
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,451
This and that.

1043
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:53,136
- We already told them everything we know.

1044
00:53:53,136 --> 00:53:55,409
And we also told the police.

1045
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:58,188
- Either one of you know
what flunitrazepam is?

1046
00:53:58,188 --> 00:53:59,177
Date rape drug?

1047
00:53:59,177 --> 00:54:00,254
- Yeah?

1048
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:01,970
- Either of you take some that night?

1049
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,515
- No, I've never even
seen that stuff before.

1050
00:54:04,515 --> 00:54:05,805
- Yeah, well, Troy did.

1051
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:07,523
A lot of it, from what we know.

1052
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:08,622
- What do you mean a lot?

1053
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:10,269
- Oh, far more than he should.

1054
00:54:10,269 --> 00:54:11,775
And considering the level of alcohol

1055
00:54:11,775 --> 00:54:13,723
and cocaine in his blood...

1056
00:54:13,723 --> 00:54:15,824
You know it's a class A misdemeanor

1057
00:54:15,824 --> 00:54:17,534
just to possess that stuff?

1058
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:18,780
And to sell it?

1059
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,711
That's a felony, six years minimum.

1060
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:22,756
You just give it to someone,

1061
00:54:22,756 --> 00:54:25,488
and the court considers as if you sold it.

1062
00:54:25,488 --> 00:54:28,353
But that's hard to prove
without an eyewitness, you know.

1063
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:32,126
If someone gave someone a
roofie, like they did to Troy.

1064
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,587
- Yeah, wow.

1065
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:37,289
What you're saying is just so interesting.

1066
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:40,293
But we're done listening to you now,

1067
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:42,708
so why don't you just
troll your little ass

1068
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,934
right back out the gate
from where you came, okay?

1069
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:48,131
- I was just hoping one
of you might be able

1070
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:49,723
to tell me who gave it to him?

1071
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:50,556
- No.

1072
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:52,125
- Would Lucas Sutherland know?

1073
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,550
Jonah Brand?

1074
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,413
- They never mentioned it.

1075
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:56,402
- Ah, you know what?

1076
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:57,972
I'll just ask them myself.

1077
00:54:57,972 --> 00:55:01,285
I'm sorry to interrupt you ladies.

1078
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:02,696
Clarence.

1079
00:55:02,696 --> 00:55:05,723
I'm gonna have to remember that word.

1080
00:55:05,723 --> 00:55:07,056
- Fucking creep.

1081
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,548
I'm so sorry.

1082
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,600
That guy was such a douchebag.

1083
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,517
(light rock music)

1084
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:26,498
- My son is not a druggie.

1085
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:28,461
- That true, Jonah?

1086
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:29,493
- Yes.

1087
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,512
- Never tried cocaine?

1088
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:32,666
- No.

1089
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,439
- Never had a puff off a joint before?

1090
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:38,420
- He's an 18 year old boy
growing up in Los Angeles, okay?

1091
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,292
Doesn't that question answer itself?

1092
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:41,583
- I wouldn't want to meet a saint

1093
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,250
even if I had the opportunity, right?

1094
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,083
Would you?

1095
00:55:45,933 --> 00:55:48,891
You and Sara were quite
close, weren't you Jonah?

1096
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:49,984
- She's my friend.

1097
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:51,855
- Not your girlfriend.

1098
00:55:51,855 --> 00:55:53,176
- She's Troy's girlfriend.

1099
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:54,759
- Not anymore, is she?

1100
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:56,869
- My son already answered you, okay?

1101
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:58,834
He told you he doesn't know when or where

1102
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:00,568
Troy got those roofies,
so if you have a question,

1103
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:02,707
I would just appreciate it
if you could just ask him,

1104
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:06,491
Jonah will answer it, and
you can leave our home.

1105
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,604
- Well I did ask a question.

1106
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:11,377
- Sara still loves Troy.

1107
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:13,518
- Well I guess that's it.

1108
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:14,464
- Done now?

1109
00:56:14,464 --> 00:56:15,297
- Yep.

1110
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:17,804
- Okay.

1111
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:22,869
- That guy's a fucking scumbag.

1112
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:24,431
What the fuck are Troy's parents doing

1113
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,656
sending around an errand boy
for them in the first place?

1114
00:56:26,656 --> 00:56:28,128
- They can't blame us.

1115
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:30,038
- They're totally blaming us.

1116
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:32,237
- No, they're blaming whoever
gave Troy the roofies.

1117
00:56:32,237 --> 00:56:34,214
- Yeah, and we're lucky he didn't ask us

1118
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:35,950
to take a blood test to see
if we'd fucking taken any.

1119
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,109
- I don't even know what they are.

1120
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:38,937
- Well you should've told the
golf shirt detective that,

1121
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,450
Jonah, then you would've
completely exonerated yourself.

1122
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:44,012
- I'm not trying to exonerate
myself from anything, Lucas.

1123
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:46,460
- Is that why you told him
you don't do blow, Jonah?

1124
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,721
Huh?

1125
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:49,848
Oh, oh, no, Mr. golf shirt fuckhead, no,

1126
00:56:49,848 --> 00:56:53,207
I don't do cocaine, I'm an
angel walking among the fallen,

1127
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:56,125
my system is as pure as the fucking snow.

1128
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,298
- I haven't done anything to you.

1129
00:56:57,298 --> 00:56:58,414
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1130
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,247
- I mean it.

1131
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:00,080
- Oh, you mean it.

1132
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,026
Look who's trying to
grow some fucking balls

1133
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:01,859
all of a sudden--

1134
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:03,091
- Will you shut the fuck up?

1135
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:04,534
- This fucking prick,
he's driving me crazy.

1136
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:05,367
- Well maybe I should go.

1137
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:06,200
- Yeah, you know what?

1138
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,033
Maybe you should.

1139
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:07,866
- No.

1140
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:09,533
I don't want you to.

1141
00:57:10,587 --> 00:57:11,640
- Thank you.

1142
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,236
- Just stop.

1143
00:57:13,236 --> 00:57:15,236
(sighs)

1144
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:17,317
- All right, so nobody knows

1145
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:20,150
where Troy got the roofies, right?

1146
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:24,156
So why don't we go find out then?

1147
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:25,656
- It could've been a million people there.

1148
00:57:25,656 --> 00:57:27,762
- We didn't even know
who threw that party.

1149
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:29,424
- Then fucking whatever,
let's go over there

1150
00:57:29,424 --> 00:57:30,914
and let's ask and let's find out

1151
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,245
who was selling the fucking--

1152
00:57:32,245 --> 00:57:33,590
- What good is that gonna do, Lucas?

1153
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:34,653
- It could be making it worse.

1154
00:57:34,653 --> 00:57:36,451
- Fuck that, it can't get worse.

1155
00:57:36,451 --> 00:57:38,722
- I'm just thinking about his parents.

1156
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:40,525
- Well they certainly aren't
thinking about any of us,

1157
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:41,510
now are they?

1158
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,997
- Why do you have to be such a prick?

1159
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:46,531
- Because it's the
primal core of my being.

1160
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,571
- Fuck you.

1161
00:57:47,571 --> 00:57:50,049
- Hey gladly, just name the place.

1162
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,205
- That's not funny.

1163
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:53,372
- Sara, I'm sorry, it's...

1164
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,833
Ah, shit.

1165
00:57:57,236 --> 00:57:59,403
- I'm gonna go get a beer.

1166
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:04,183
- Can you get me a vodka and OJ?

1167
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:07,527
- Yo, could you grab me a
beer too, if that's cool?

1168
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:08,654
- Sure.

I called a couple times.

1210
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:41,047
I figured you needed your space.

1211
01:00:41,047 --> 01:00:41,880
- Yeah.

1212
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,013
I didn't really leave my
room for a couple of days.

1213
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:49,013
Erin crashed last night.

1214

- That's good.

1215
01:00:53,114 --> 01:00:54,391
How's she?

1216
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:55,474

1217
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:58,405
- And Lucas?

1218
01:01:01,212 --> 01:01:02,462
- I don't know.

1219
01:01:08,296 --> 01:01:11,629
I can't really sleep or eat or anything.

1220
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:18,072
It's like I'm just, I'm feeling I'm this

1221
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:21,155
big pointless, I don't know, nothing.

1222
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:25,317
I shouldn't have come here.

1223
01:01:25,317 --> 01:01:26,234
- No, wait.

1224
01:01:28,496 --> 01:01:31,405
Maybe we should go away for the weekend.

1225
01:01:31,405 --> 01:01:34,406
You know, escape everything for a while.

1226
01:01:34,406 --> 01:01:35,959
- Where?

1227
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,209
- I don't know.

1228
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:39,995
Tijuana?

1229
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:46,238
- Yeah, Erin might be into that.

1230
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,542

dad's birthday tomorrow.

1231
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:51,449
- Right.

1232

you guys fighting anymore.

1257

1268
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:41,707
- She went to Mexico
with fucking K-mart boy.

1269
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:43,090
- Bullshit.

1270
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:44,607
- No, I've been calling
her cell all morning,

1271
01:03:44,607 --> 01:03:45,746
she won't pick up.

1272
01:03:45,746 --> 01:03:47,779
I call her house, the maid
says she went to Mexico

1273
01:03:47,779 --> 01:03:48,612
for the weekend.

1274
01:03:48,612 --> 01:03:50,904
- And how do you know she went with Jonah?

1275
01:03:50,904 --> 01:03:52,870
- Oh please, who else
is Sara gonna be with?

1276
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,308
And besides, he's not
picking up his phone either.

1277
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:56,924
- So she took your advice.

1278
01:03:56,924 --> 01:03:58,910
- No, no no no no no no.

1279
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,878
See, I never fucking told
her about going down there.

1280
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,952
Fucking Jonah.

1281
01:04:01,952 --> 01:04:03,820
That little Salvation Army faggot

1282
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,276
must've heard me talking about it.

1283
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:08,114
- Do you know how fucking
paranoid you sound right now?

1284
01:04:08,114 --> 01:04:09,970
- Don't you think any of this
is just slightly suspicious?

1285
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:13,256
- No, I don't, I think you
sound slightly retarded.

1286
01:04:13,256 --> 01:04:14,301
- What are you talking about?

1287
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:15,387
- Why don't you just come over.

1288
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:16,220
- Why?

1289
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,371
- Oh, I forgot, you have
such important shit to do.

1290
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:21,741
- Oh ha ha ha ha ha, very fucking funny.

1291
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:22,574
- Hello?

1292
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:28,349
(steady rock music)

1293
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,650
- Thanks for letting me come.

1294
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,859
Yeah, so it's Trevor,
Elbar, Main Street, might?

1295
01:05:53,859 --> 01:05:55,314
- Yeah, yeah, Trevor's your man, I mean,

1296
01:05:55,314 --> 01:05:56,917
he's gonna hook you up
with whatever you want.

1297
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,482
- So I can roll up there
by myself, that's cool?

1298
01:05:59,482 --> 01:06:00,725
- You got it.

1299
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:04,308
- Appreciate it, peace,
I'll see you later.

1300
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:25,178
- God, I feel so good.

1301
01:06:25,178 --> 01:06:26,011
- Heaven.

1302
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:31,383
- Today has been the best day

1303
01:06:32,443 --> 01:06:33,943
of my entire life.

1304
01:06:37,132 --> 01:06:37,965
- Really?

1305
01:06:39,572 --> 01:06:40,405
- Yeah.

1306

Stop.

1318
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:20,995
Jonah.

1319
01:08:24,589 --> 01:08:25,422
Jonah!

1320
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:28,191
Stop.

1321
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:41,591
(crickets chirping)

1322
01:08:47,526 --> 01:08:49,427
- What did I do?

1323
01:08:49,427 --> 01:08:50,749
What did I do?

1324
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:51,916
What did I do?

1325
01:09:03,503 --> 01:09:06,086
- Should we try going to sleep?

1326
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:15,603
- I want to go home.

1327
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,243
I want to go home.

1328
01:09:21,243 --> 01:09:23,804
- This is cool out here, man.

1329
01:09:23,804 --> 01:09:25,963
You got space, you can smoke and stuff.

1330
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:26,796
- Yeah.

1331
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:30,832
- Yeah, Danny's party was tight, man.

1332
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,810
I had a real good time, like
I hooked up with this chick,

1333
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:36,801
she let me like play with her
tits and stuff, it was fun.

1334
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,518
- I guess you didn't come
for the company, huh?

1335
01:09:39,518 --> 01:09:40,351
- No, no.

1336
01:09:41,374 --> 01:09:45,029
Yo, you got anything to come down on?

1337
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:47,120
- I got a couple of blues.

1338
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,552
- Yeah, actually I was
looking for some roofies.

1339
01:09:50,552 --> 01:09:52,544
You see I had some at the
party, they like laid me out,

1340
01:09:52,544 --> 01:09:54,946
and I wanted to get my hands on some more.

1341
01:09:54,946 --> 01:09:58,005
- That's a fat way to come down, kid.

1342
01:09:58,005 --> 01:09:58,838
- Yeah.

1343
01:09:59,888 --> 01:10:02,637
Yeah, I guess my boy must've
got 'em from you there.

1344
01:10:02,637 --> 01:10:03,619
You know him, right?

1345
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:04,747
Troy?

1346
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:05,580
Tall kid?

1347
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:11,022
- That cornbread looking mother fucker?

1348
01:10:11,022 --> 01:10:11,855
- Yeah.

1349
01:10:12,969 --> 01:10:15,330
- That cat is a straight
hoover bag, you know that?

1350
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:16,430
- What do you mean?

1351
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,133
- I mean I watched him do a
quart of G in five minutes.

1352
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:21,216
- Yeah, sounds like Troy.

1353
01:10:22,349 --> 01:10:24,099
- It's fucked up, yo.

1354
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,188
Talking a gang of shit
to that friend of his.

1355
01:10:28,188 --> 01:10:31,051
- What are you talking about, what friend?

1356
01:10:31,051 --> 01:10:34,134
(intense rock music)

1357
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,154
- Hey, listen Sara, I'm really...

1358
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,573
I'm sorry!

1359
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:01,374
- Jonah?

1360
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:08,928
- Sorry I'm late, I'll
get to work right now.

1361
01:12:08,928 --> 01:12:10,261
- You all right?

1362
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,284
- Have you ever done something

1363
01:12:20,284 --> 01:12:23,201
to someone that you shouldn't have?

1364
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:26,022
- God, I'm so stupid.

1365
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:30,884
I'm such a fucking idiot.

1366
01:12:30,884 --> 01:12:31,717
- No.

1367
01:12:33,244 --> 01:12:36,631
I slept with lots of guys
when I was drunk, okay?

1368
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:37,464
It's not--

1369
01:12:37,464 --> 01:12:40,214
- Erin, it's different than that.

1370
01:12:42,286 --> 01:12:43,953
You know that it is.

1371
01:12:45,925 --> 01:12:49,595
You haven't ever done anything, ever,

1372
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:51,595
like I just did to Troy.

1373
01:12:52,579 --> 01:12:53,412
- Okay.

1374
01:12:55,044 --> 01:12:58,026
But it's not all your fault.

1375
01:12:58,026 --> 01:13:00,862
- It's not like we meant for it to happen.

1376
01:13:00,862 --> 01:13:05,112
We didn't go down there
planning on doing anything.

1377
01:13:06,071 --> 01:13:07,154
- You didn't.

1378
01:13:08,538 --> 01:13:09,955
- Don't say that.

1379
01:13:11,293 --> 01:13:12,635
- Jonah.

1380
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:13,468
Get in the car.

1381
01:13:13,468 --> 01:13:15,385
Get in the fucking car.

1382
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,484
Guess where I just stopped at, Jonah.

1383
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,403
Can you guess?

1384
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:29,235
Guess who just told me you
sold the drugs to Troy?

1385
01:13:29,235 --> 01:13:30,068
- No.

1386
01:13:30,068 --> 01:13:31,026
- No?

1387
01:13:31,026 --> 01:13:33,626
No, don't you fucking lie to
me, you little piece of shit.

1388
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:35,587
Don't you fucking lie to me.

1389
01:13:35,587 --> 01:13:37,653
He knew your name, Jonah.

1390
01:13:37,653 --> 01:13:40,046
He knew your fucking name.

1391
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:41,046
You hear me?

1392
01:13:42,874 --> 01:13:44,702
Fucking lie to me!

1393
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:45,984
Say it!

1394
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,732
Say you fucking did it,
say you fucking did it,

1395
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:49,315
you fucking say it.

1396
01:13:54,925 --> 01:13:57,842
(lighter clicking)

1397
01:14:15,926 --> 01:14:18,509
Now get the fuck out of my car.

1398
01:14:19,358 --> 01:14:20,191
Go work.

1399
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:28,934
- Hey, Jonah.

1400
01:14:28,934 --> 01:14:30,434
Wanna go to lunch?

1401
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,486
You all right?

1402
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,262
- Yeah.

1403
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:38,674
Yeah, I'll go.

1404
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,319
- Cool.

1405
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:41,821
Let me change real quick.

1406
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:44,488
Stupid lab jackets are so gross.

1407
01:14:48,472 --> 01:14:49,334
- Hey!

1408
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:52,599
Your fucking faggot stock boy
is stealing drugs from you!

1409
01:14:52,599 --> 01:14:55,435
He's handing out pills like
it's fucking Christmas!

1410
01:14:55,435 --> 01:14:57,648
Go on you fucking faggot!

1411
01:14:57,648 --> 01:14:59,065
Fucking tell him!

1412
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:05,697
- How about Chinese?

1413
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:11,798
- You know it's a federal
offense to steal medication?

1414
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:12,881
At any level?

1415
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:18,959
That boy wasn't lying, was he.

1416
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:27,514
Jonah, I'm gonna let you go.

1417
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:33,453
Right now, in fact.

1418
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,912
(steady rock music)

1419
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:10,032
- What are you doing here?

1420
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,418
- Doing what you do in a place like this.

1421
01:16:12,418 --> 01:16:14,501
Picking up my medication.

1422
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:19,449
See you later, kid.

1423
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:23,540
(steady rock music)

1424
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:44,035
- Well aren't you full of surprises.

1425
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:48,353
- I've been calling.

1426
01:17:48,353 --> 01:17:49,186
- Yeah.

1427
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:52,809
I've been crazy busy.

1428
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:53,892
- Doing what?

1429
01:17:55,795 --> 01:17:59,462
- What are you doing
in my back yard, Jonah?

1430
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,083
- I worry, Sara.

1431
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,100
I just want to make everything right.

1432
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:08,933
- What?

1433
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:12,825
- Tijuana.

1434
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:15,942
I'm really sorry.

1435
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,525
- It was a mistake.

1436
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:22,164
- But I can be better, so much better.

1437
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,782
- It's not about that.

1438
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,838
- I know, I know, but see,
that's why I want to fix it.

1439
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:30,255
Because I know I can, if you just let me.

1440
01:18:31,288 --> 01:18:32,621
Will you let me?

1441
01:18:33,818 --> 01:18:35,081
Please?

1442
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:37,164
- I think you need to go.

1443
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,513
- He thought a lot of himself, didn't he?

1444
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:41,346
Troy.

1445
01:18:44,434 --> 01:18:49,279
Everyone at Hartwood thought
a lot about themselves.

1446
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:54,096
And why shouldn't they, when
they have so much and I have...

1447
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:54,929
But you.

1448
01:18:55,928 --> 01:18:57,734
- You need to go.

1449
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:59,317
- That first night,

1450
01:19:00,585 --> 01:19:03,776
the first night you spoke to me.

1451
01:19:03,776 --> 01:19:05,559
You wanted to be my friend because I knew

1452
01:19:05,559 --> 01:19:07,809
who Samantha Carabinas was.

1453
01:19:11,381 --> 01:19:13,048
It was unimaginable.

1454
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:16,726
It was everything I ever wanted.

1455
01:19:18,493 --> 01:19:20,160
Then there was Troy.

1456
01:19:22,964 --> 01:19:26,904
Touching you, grabbing
you, and kissing you.

1457
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:27,972
- Jonah.

1458
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,359
- You remember singing to me?

1459
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:30,328
- No.

1460
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:31,411
- At karaoke.

1461
01:19:32,589 --> 01:19:34,608
- I was singing to Troy.

1462
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:37,108
- No, no, see, you sang to me.

1463
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,117
- By all means, man, have one more.

1464
01:19:40,117 --> 01:19:41,133
- I know you did.

1465
01:19:41,133 --> 01:19:43,665
You sang to me for a
moment, and I knew it then.

1466
01:19:43,665 --> 01:19:45,201
I knew you cared then.

1467
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:48,701
- Jonah, I do care, okay, but I love Troy.

1468
01:19:53,893 --> 01:19:55,769
- But you sang to me.

1469
01:19:55,769 --> 01:19:56,602
- So?

1470
01:19:59,498 --> 01:20:01,186
- Then we danced together.

1471
01:20:01,186 --> 01:20:02,019
- Jonah.

1472
01:20:02,019 --> 01:20:02,921
- And we got high together.

1473
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:04,305
- None of that means anything.

1474
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:07,305
- No, it did, it did mean something!

1475
01:20:09,734 --> 01:20:10,567
I'm sorry.

1476
01:20:11,572 --> 01:20:12,405
I'm...

1477
01:20:16,243 --> 01:20:17,076
God.

1478
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:31,614
Sorry.

1479
01:20:36,494 --> 01:20:37,327
Sara.

1480
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:46,928
I want to confront the situation.

1481
01:20:48,596 --> 01:20:50,940
- Jonah, just forget TJ, okay?

1482
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,523
- No, no, not that.

1483
01:20:55,145 --> 01:20:57,895
The night with Troy at the party.

1484
01:21:04,305 --> 01:21:06,176
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1485
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:08,018
Come on, Jonah.

1486
01:21:08,018 --> 01:21:10,064
Never had blow like this man, look at it.

1487
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:12,731
It's practically fucking yellow.

1488
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,263
You know this night is it, right?

1489
01:21:16,263 --> 01:21:18,321
When I stop being me
and start being some guy

1490
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:20,292
that I don't even fucking know.

1491
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,863
Join the Cig Eps.

1492
01:21:21,863 --> 01:21:23,530
Just like Pops.

1493
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,529
What do they call that shit?

1494
01:21:24,529 --> 01:21:25,362
What do they call it?

1495
01:21:25,362 --> 01:21:26,195
- Call what?

1496
01:21:26,195 --> 01:21:28,702
- You know, fucking, a legacy.

1497
01:21:28,702 --> 01:21:30,859
I'm gonna be a jackass legacy.

1498
01:21:30,859 --> 01:21:31,692
Pathetic.

1499
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:35,025
- I'm gonna go.

1500
01:21:35,025 --> 01:21:36,467
- You can't go, Jonah Jone.

1501
01:21:36,467 --> 01:21:37,763
- I'm gonna get home.

1502
01:21:37,763 --> 01:21:39,345
- Yeah, you know it,
man, you fucking know it.

1503
01:21:39,345 --> 01:21:40,845
Anyway, come here.

1504
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:48,533
- I gave him the pills,
and I bought them for him,

1505
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:52,142
but I swear, I didn't
know what they would do.

1506
01:21:52,142 --> 01:21:55,340
- You gotta have something to

1507
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,457
take the edge off.

1508
01:21:57,457 --> 01:21:59,402
- Yo, fuck that, you fucked up enough.

1509
01:21:59,402 --> 01:22:01,718
- I know, all right?

1510
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:04,169
I got three roofies, I'll
give you half of one.

1511
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,959
- I'll buy two off you for 50 bucks.

1512
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:10,042
- Fuck that, you'll go down for good.

1513
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:14,213
- You believe me, right?

1514
01:22:14,213 --> 01:22:16,189
- It's not gonna do shit.

1515
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:17,272
Fuck you too.

1516
01:22:18,178 --> 01:22:20,362
- You understand.

1517
01:22:20,362 --> 01:22:22,082
- Jonah, come here.

1518
01:22:22,082 --> 01:22:23,475
Do me a favor, all right?

1519
01:22:23,475 --> 01:22:24,994
Go buy those two roofies off him.

1520
01:22:24,994 --> 01:22:26,061
- Yeah, but he just said...

1521
01:22:26,061 --> 01:22:27,816
- I'm sorry about going
off like that, all right?

1522
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:29,758
The hum's fucking with my head.

1523
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:32,373
Do me a favor and hook
that shit up, all right?

1524
01:22:32,373 --> 01:22:36,873
You wouldn't want Sara to
see me like this, would you?

1525
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:44,787
- My boss fired me today

1526
01:22:44,787 --> 01:22:47,656
because he found about
me stealing the pills.

1527
01:22:47,656 --> 01:22:51,018
The pills that I've been stealing for you.

1528
01:22:51,018 --> 01:22:53,854
- Can you hook me up
with those two roofies?

1529
01:22:53,854 --> 01:22:55,463
- So you can go give 'em
to hoover bag in there?

1530
01:22:55,463 --> 01:22:58,274
- No, no, they're for me.

1531
01:22:58,274 --> 01:22:59,107
And Sara.

1532
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:04,259
- If he reports me, I go to jail.

1533
01:23:06,454 --> 01:23:08,787
But not if you come with me.

1534
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:14,690
If you come with me, then
we can go to Tijuana,

1535
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,563
and I can make it right between us,

1536
01:23:17,563 --> 01:23:19,896
the way it's supposed to be.

1537
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:24,214
I can get pills, and I can get money,

1538
01:23:25,966 --> 01:23:29,133
but you, just say you'll come with me.

1539
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:33,846
Come with me please.

1540
01:23:33,846 --> 01:23:34,679
Please.

1541
01:23:37,004 --> 01:23:37,837
- Okay.

1542
01:23:41,634 --> 01:23:42,467
- Okay.

1543
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:46,770

(phone ringing)

1549
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:37,306
- [Sara] Hey it's Sara,
you've reached my cell,

1550
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:38,886
leave me a message, bye.

1551
01:24:38,886 --> 01:24:40,577
(beeps)

1552
01:24:40,577 --> 01:24:43,501
- Hey, it's me, I'm at my house right now,

1553
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:48,084
I am gonna put a bag together
and I will be right over.

1554
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,970
- Where do you think you're going?

1555
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:55,705
- Just to Sara's house,
her cabin, up at Big Bear--

1556
01:24:55,705 --> 01:24:59,970
- That was Mr. Miller's
daughter on the phone just now.

1557
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,068
- Yeah?

1558
01:25:01,068 --> 01:25:03,528
- Mhmm, and he's on his
way over to the pharmacy

1559
01:25:03,528 --> 01:25:05,778
because it was broken into.

1560
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,482
- Wow, really?

1561
01:25:09,482 --> 01:25:10,967
- Yeah, really.

1562
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:12,972
You're not going anywhere, Jonah.

1563
01:25:12,972 --> 01:25:13,805
- Mom, I'm--

1564
01:25:13,805 --> 01:25:15,262
- Jonah, you are not going anywhere, okay?

1565
01:25:15,262 --> 01:25:17,691
Somebody is coming over here.

1566
01:25:17,691 --> 01:25:19,102
- Why?

1567
01:25:19,102 --> 01:25:21,018
- $60,000, Jonah.

1568
01:25:21,018 --> 01:25:22,165
- Mom, no one stole $60,000--

1569
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:23,212
- $60,000.

1570
01:25:23,212 --> 01:25:24,047
- That's crazy!

1571
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:25,976
- That is what I have paid for your school

1572
01:25:25,976 --> 01:25:27,300
for the last four years,

1573
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,147
and now you have taken all
of that time and that money--

1574
01:25:30,147 --> 01:25:31,903
- I didn't want to go there, Mom!

1575
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:32,736
- That is not--

1576
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:34,807
- In fact, I was fucking miserable!

1577
01:25:34,807 --> 01:25:35,968
- Jonah, that is no excuse--

1578
01:25:35,968 --> 01:25:36,828
- Do you hear me?!

1579
01:25:36,828 --> 01:25:38,169
Fucking miserable!

1580
01:25:38,169 --> 01:25:39,427
Miserable!

1581
01:25:39,427 --> 01:25:41,062
I wasn't human there, Mom!

1582
01:25:41,062 --> 01:25:42,591
Do you fucking hear me?!

1583
01:25:42,591 --> 01:25:44,002
I was miserable!

1584
01:25:44,002 --> 01:25:45,991
I wasn't fucking human!

1585
01:25:45,991 --> 01:25:46,867
I gotta go!

1586
01:25:46,867 --> 01:25:49,117
(shouting)

1587
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:53,194
(crying)

1588
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:54,027
Are you okay?

1589
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:55,606
I'm sorry.

1590
01:25:55,606 --> 01:25:57,408
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1591
01:25:57,408 --> 01:25:58,241
- Get out!

1592
01:26:01,419 --> 01:26:02,252
- Fuck!

1593
01:26:08,941 --> 01:26:11,441
(dog barking)

1594
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:14,594
- Oh god.

1595
01:26:16,303 --> 01:26:17,136
Oh my.

1596
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,596
(banging)

1597
01:26:31,632 --> 01:26:33,799
(banging)

1598
01:26:36,475 --> 01:26:38,642
(banging)

1599
01:26:43,777 --> 01:26:44,993
(phone dialing)

1600
01:26:44,993 --> 01:26:48,275
(phone ringing)

1601
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:49,196
- [Sara] Jonah.

1602
01:26:49,196 --> 01:26:51,184
- Hey, I'm at your house,
you're supposed to be here.

1603
01:26:51,184 --> 01:26:53,963
- [Sara] Yeah, I'm not home, okay?

1604
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:55,380
- I can see that.

1605
01:26:56,649 --> 01:26:58,534
- [Sara] I gotta go, Jonah.

1606
01:26:58,534 --> 01:26:59,367
- What?

1607
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:01,106
- [Sara] I gotta go.

1608
01:27:01,106 --> 01:27:01,939
Wait...

1609
01:27:04,532 --> 01:27:06,209
You fucking kidding me?

1610
01:27:06,209 --> 01:27:07,877
Kidding me, are you kidding me?

1611
01:27:07,877 --> 01:27:09,833
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1612
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:11,166
Fuck, fuck fuck!

1613
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,153
- Jonah.

1614
01:27:15,312 --> 01:27:16,145
Bad day?

1615
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:22,232
(screaming)

1616
01:27:26,111 --> 01:27:28,197
- No, it was an accident.

1617
01:27:28,197 --> 01:27:30,189
- Who cares if it was an accident
or it wasn't an accident,

1618
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:31,022
all right?

1619
01:27:31,022 --> 01:27:32,891
- You're the one who said
that Troy killed himself.

1620
01:27:32,891 --> 01:27:34,792
- Yeah, that was before I knew
Jonah bought him the pills

1621
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,462
and fucking gave them to him.

1622
01:27:37,462 --> 01:27:39,867
- You know, he didn't
know what he was doing.

1623
01:27:39,867 --> 01:27:41,665
- Think about this for a second.

1624
01:27:41,665 --> 01:27:44,588
The little cocksucker's
infatuated with you, all right?

1625
01:27:44,588 --> 01:27:47,705
And do you honestly think
that he was helping Troy

1626
01:27:47,705 --> 01:27:49,074
by feeding him a bunch of pills

1627
01:27:49,074 --> 01:27:50,767
a drug dealer wouldn't even give him?

1628
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,426
- You don't even want to
hear his side of the story.

1629
01:27:52,426 --> 01:27:53,259
- Jesus Christ.

1630
01:27:53,259 --> 01:27:54,163
- You never liked him.

1631
01:27:54,163 --> 01:27:54,996
- It's like talking to fucking wallpaper.

1632
01:27:54,996 --> 01:27:55,829
- You can shut up now.

1633
01:27:55,829 --> 01:27:56,662
- Shut up--

1634
01:27:56,662 --> 01:27:57,495
- We've heard enough.

1635
01:27:57,495 --> 01:27:58,328
You're harassing her--

1636
01:27:58,328 --> 01:27:59,161
- Chill the fuck out, I am
chill, she's not listening.

1637
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:00,553
- Just leave her alone.

1638
01:28:00,553 --> 01:28:01,386
God.

1639
01:28:33,673 --> 01:28:36,716
- Never met anyone with a
bigger fucking mouth, seriously.

1640
01:28:36,716 --> 01:28:37,556
- Uh huh.

1641
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:38,389
- Just don't talk.

1642
01:28:38,389 --> 01:28:39,222
Just don't talk.

1643
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:44,222
- Because I'm the only one
that's fucking saying anything.

1644
01:28:44,228 --> 01:28:47,228
(crickets chirping)

1645
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:57,816
(water dripping)

1646
01:28:57,816 --> 01:28:59,450
(knocking)

1647
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:00,617
- I'm in here.

1648
01:29:10,682 --> 01:29:11,849
- You hate me.

1649
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:14,678
- No, I really don't, Jonah.

1650
01:29:14,678 --> 01:29:17,393
- Then what are you doing to me?

1651
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:19,248
- What are you talking about?

1652
01:29:19,248 --> 01:29:21,474
- You hung up on me.

1653
01:29:21,474 --> 01:29:23,724
- I was freaking out, okay?

1654
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:31,546
- Did you tell Lucas and Erin about Troy?

1655
01:29:33,725 --> 01:29:34,558
- No.

1656
01:29:39,022 --> 01:29:41,086
(crying)

1657
01:29:41,086 --> 01:29:42,038
- God dammit.

1658
01:29:42,038 --> 01:29:42,955
God dammit.

1659
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:47,504
(doorbell rings)

1660
01:30:02,517 --> 01:30:03,350
Want one?

1661
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,183
- No.

1662
01:30:05,302 --> 01:30:06,233
- Come on.

1663
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:08,442
- I don't want it, Jonah.

1664
01:30:08,442 --> 01:30:09,771
I just said I don't want it.

1665
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:11,854
- You know I watched you.

1666
01:30:12,888 --> 01:30:16,305
From the first day I saw you at Hartwood.

1667
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:21,073
Our freshman yeah, you wore long skirts,

1668
01:30:21,073 --> 01:30:25,490
and you brought bagged
lunches and you played tennis.

1669
01:30:26,814 --> 01:30:30,746
And in sophomore year, you
stopped bringing bagged lunches

1670
01:30:30,746 --> 01:30:34,031
and you started wearing miniskirts.

1671
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:37,864
And then junior year,
no more tennis, nothing.

1672
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,753
Just Troy.

1673
01:30:47,261 --> 01:30:50,261
I would've given anything to be him.

1674
01:30:52,054 --> 01:30:54,594
But I was Jonah Brand.

1675
01:30:54,594 --> 01:30:57,094
Kid without a car, no friends.

1676
01:30:58,276 --> 01:31:03,276
Whose mom drove him to
school 'til he was a senior.

1677
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:06,057
How could I talk to you?

1678
01:31:06,057 --> 01:31:08,057
It was an impossibility.

1679
01:31:09,285 --> 01:31:13,004
Until I saw your mom in that movie,

1680
01:31:13,004 --> 01:31:14,444
a week before graduation.

1681
01:31:14,444 --> 01:31:15,361
- You lied.

1682
01:31:16,378 --> 01:31:17,289
- I know.

1683
01:31:17,289 --> 01:31:19,479
And I'm sorry, and I'm really sorry.

1684
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:20,619
- It's okay, Jonah.

1685
01:31:20,619 --> 01:31:21,765
It's really okay.

1686
01:31:21,765 --> 01:31:23,575
- But it worked, didn't it?

1687
01:31:23,575 --> 01:31:25,221
It worked.

1688
01:31:25,221 --> 01:31:27,366
You talked to me, you finally talked to me

1689
01:31:27,366 --> 01:31:29,886
after four years of being invisible.

1690
01:31:29,886 --> 01:31:32,631
I mean, that's all I ever
wanted was your friendship.

1691
01:31:32,631 --> 01:31:36,151
- We are friends, Jonah,
okay, we're friends.

1692
01:31:36,151 --> 01:31:37,799
But that's it.

1693
01:31:37,799 --> 01:31:39,430
- No.

1694
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:40,430
Not anymore.

1695
01:31:41,515 --> 01:31:42,932
Not after Mexico.

1696
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,153
- Please let go of my hand, Jonah.

1697
01:31:49,127 --> 01:31:51,089
- I'm so stupid.

1698
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:52,806
- Please let go.

1699
01:31:52,806 --> 01:31:54,190
Please.

1700
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:56,273
- You know Lucas?

1701
01:31:56,273 --> 01:31:58,006
- Yeah, we met.

1702
01:31:58,006 --> 01:31:59,589
- I'll go get Sara.

1703
01:32:00,564 --> 01:32:03,647
(suspenseful music)

1704
01:32:08,017 --> 01:32:09,767
- It's your favorite.

1705
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,603
You use them.

1706
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:19,852
We had them every day when
we were down in Mexico.

1707
01:32:19,852 --> 01:32:22,430
But we're not going anywhere now, are we?

1708
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:23,263
Are we?

1709
01:32:24,304 --> 01:32:25,137
- Sara?

1710
01:32:27,123 --> 01:32:27,956
Sara?

1711
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:30,606
Are you in there?

1712
01:32:33,925 --> 01:32:36,357
- I'll be right out.

1713
01:32:36,357 --> 01:32:38,190
- We'll be downstairs.

1714
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:44,022
- Go on, take them.

1715
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:44,855
- No.

1716
01:32:44,855 --> 01:32:45,688
- Take them!

1717
01:32:45,688 --> 01:32:47,021
- You take them!

1718
01:32:51,536 --> 01:32:53,949
Jonah, what are you doing?

1719
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:56,032
(crying)

1720
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:07,302
Jonah.

1721
01:33:15,845 --> 01:33:17,595
Jonah, don't, please.

1722
01:33:18,887 --> 01:33:20,054
Please, Jonah.

1723
01:33:21,406 --> 01:33:25,770
- I just want to make
everything okay, all right?

1724
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:28,625
I just want to make everything okay.

1725
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:30,668
(crying)

1726
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:31,585
I love you.

1727
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:38,220
- Please.
