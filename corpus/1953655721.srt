(brakes squeal)

00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,121
- (honks)
- David.

32
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,213
Hey.

33
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,508
Hey. Are you ready?

34
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,260
Yeah. Hey, you can put your stuff
in the back.

35
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,346
Okay. But first...

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,099
- I need to show you something.
- What? No, we gotta go.

37
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,435
Naomi and Brice are, like, five minutes
away, so come on, get out of the car.

38
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,980
- Okay.
- Come on.

39
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,606
Okay.
(chuckles)

40
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,487
- All right, get up. Get up here.
- What?

41
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,948
Yeah. Okay.
Ahem...

42
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,911
I know that finishing
this semester at LSU

43
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,081
is really, like, all we've been
thinking about lately.

44
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,333
But I just want you to know

45
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,794
that I still think of you a lot too.

46
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,338
And, actually,

47
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,217
just the other day
I was out and...

48
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,013
I got this.

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,892
It's... it's a promise ring.

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,396
And I don't think we're ready
for an engagement just yet,

51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,773
but I just want you to know
how I feel.

52
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,777
And when I bought it,
I wanted to give it to you

53
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,572
while we watched the sunrise

54
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,325
and say something cool
or special,

55
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,535
but I can't really think of anything
cool or special.

56
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,704
Now I'm just kind of
feeling cheesy.

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,750
I just want you to know
that I love you

58
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,003
and I'm gonna be there for you
no matter what, I promise.

59
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,922
You're too good for me.

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,924
You really are. You are.

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,300
- (horn honking)
- Naomi: Taylor! Whoo!

62
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,636
Oh, here they come.

63
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,888
Let's go.

64
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,182
- (rap music playing)
- Naomi: I'm pretty sure.

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,100
- Brice: All right, all right.
- But I don't know.

66
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,310
- You don't?
- No.

67
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,228
- Do you even know how to work this?
- Of course I do.

68
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,941
Killer. Look at you,
learning how to work your mama's car.

69
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,985
Okay, okay.

70
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,612
Stop it. Stop it. Brice.

71
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,865
Don't look like you don't enjoy being
a girlfriend of a future NFL superstar.

72
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,451
Okay, big head.
If that head gets any bigger,

73
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,745
I'm strapping you
to their Jeep.

74
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,622
- (horn honks)
- Taylor: Get a room.

75
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,086
- What's up, man?
- We're already late. Come on, crazy.

76
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,088
(car lock chirps)

77
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,298
- You hear that, man?
- David: About time you got here.

78
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,425
Mwah. Mwah.

79
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:05,137
Oh, I'm so ready for this trip,
it's not even funny.

80
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,681
Are you ready to have fun?

81
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,599
- Am I ready to have fun?
- That's what I asked you.

82
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,518
- Are you ready to have fun?
- Well, I know I'm ready to have fun.

83
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,645
I was just making sure you were
ready to have fun.

84
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,398
I am the king of fun.
Of course I'm ready.

85
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,275
Oh, my gosh.
Big head, just come get in the car.

86
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,694
Jeez.

87
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,570
Naomi:
You see what I deal with?

88
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,739
Did you guys see this?
All the time.

89
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,582
Naomi: Whoo!
Yeah, let’s go! Vacation!

90
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,298

00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,440
Where's y'all's car?
I didn't see it.

106
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,025
Oh, it's in the shop this weekend.

107
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,526
We're just gonna use yours
if we need one.

108
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,237
- Oh, okay.
- Howard: Well, you decided to show up.

109
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,781
Taylor: Hi.

110
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,575
Oh, my God, Sharley,
this place is so beautiful.

111
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,619
Howard:
Yeah, it ought to be.

112
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,996
It's my dad's favorite summer home
he never lets anyone stay at.

113
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,664
So "vous etre si chez voix."

114
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,542
- "Chez vous," baby, "chez vous."
- Oh, I love when you correct me, baby.

115
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,670
Or as they say in Mexican,
"mi casa, su casa."

116
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,547
- All right.
- Just stop. Help them with their bags.

117
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,382
- Naomi: Hi.
- Guys, enjoy these moments right now,

118
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,635
- because in a few years...
- Naomi: Cute dress.

119
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,678
...it's gonna be all work,
no play.

120
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,222
- Naomi: Come on.
- Howard: Yeah, that's right,

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,432
'cause in a few years
when y'all are busting your asses,

122
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,893
I'm gonna be sailing the coast of Bali
with my dad's life insurance check

123
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,062
- in my motherfucking account.
- Sharley: Howard.

124
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,563
- Baby, I'm just joking.
- Brice: Oh, man.

125
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,273
Taylor: Shar, you have
a radio here, right?

126
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,067
Sharley: No, hon', you're just
gonna have to deal.

127
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,402
Get used to no cell service, guys.
It's basically nonexistent

128
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,072
- till my dad has a tower built.
- Wait, wait, dude, are you serious?

129
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,324
I got a whole bunch of calls
I gotta make about my internship.

130
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,409
And plus, what if somebody
breaks their leg or something?

131
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,829
Oh, if there's an emergency,
there's a landline in the kitchen.

132
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,914
And if you're a total pussy,
you can walk a half a mile

133
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,166
to Mr. Bromlin's house
and get reception there.

134
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,044
Well, you know what? It actually feels
kind of good not having my cell phone.

135
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,131
Agreed. It gives us time
to actually talk instead of texting.

136
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,841
- Does that feel good, you guys?
- Feels good.

137
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,636
Feels good? Now this circle jerk
is over, let me show you to your rooms.

138
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,180
Bricey, since you are
just so damn sexy,

139
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,057
you get the first master bedroom.
It is badass.

140
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,809
- David, there's your room.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

141
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,811
Fucking jackass,
I've got my laptop in there.

142
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,312
- What, is that your bag?
- Yeah.

143
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,148
- Dude, I thought that was Taylor's.
- No, man.

144
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,984
Something wrong with you, boy.
Now me and the lady...

145
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,611
me and the lady are gonna take
the other master bedroom

146
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,739
where we will make
sweet, passionate love.

147
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,160
Unless, of course, you guys... you know,
you want to switch it up a bit

148
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,995
and the dudes can take
this bedroom here

149
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,122
while me and the ladies
take the other one.

150
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,332
- What?
- Stop it.

151
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,459
- Is that bad?
- That's enough.

152
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,919
Baby. Wow.

153
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,588
Ladies, you want to go
check out the back yard?

154
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,631
- Sure.
- How is this not a j...? Look, baby,

155
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,341
oh, this is... only in pretend

156
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,927
would you and your friends
sleep with me in the same bed.

157
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,637
- Huh?
- Grow up.

158
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,222
- Yeah? Unless you want to.
- Bye.

159
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,932
- Would you just think about it?
- (door opens)

160
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,476
Oh, I love you too, baby,
light of my life.

161
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,645
(squealing, chattering)

162
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,361
Whoo! Oh!

163
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,529
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

164
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,656
Let's go. Let's go.

165
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,367
(squealing, laughing)

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,778
David:
Hey.

191
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,613
Yeah. I'll take two.

192
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,532
- Growing boy, need my vitamins.
- I'm out.

193
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,743
- And grab one for Naomi.
- Thank you.

194
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,579
Yeah, five bucks says
he can't carry that many beers.

195
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,040
Yes, he can.

196
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,543
- He can.
- He dragged Howie in.

197
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,260
So what do you guys say...

198
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,179
tomorrow we go to the lake,
take out the Jet Skis?

199
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,473
Jet Skis? Really?
Champions right here.

200
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,267
- Oh, okay.
- Brice: Baby, you tell them.

201
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,811
- We'll have competition over here.
- Competition.

202
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,063
Taylor: I really don't know
how you can be better at Jet Skis.

203
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,274
(laughing)

204
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,610
(phone beeping)

205
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,821
Um, fuck.

206
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,489
Um...

207
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,036
Newbuck residence.

208
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,455
This is Mr. Newbuck.
Get Howard.

209
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,457
Are you all right, Mr. Newbuck?

210
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,834
Newbuck: There's been a rogue
terrorist attack on the Gulf Coast.

211
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,503
- (crashing)
- Jesus. Oh.

212
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,131
Uh, uh, hey, guys!

213
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,759
Come in here for a second.

214
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,344
You couldn't carry
that many beers?

215
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,846
Mr. Newbuck: Howard?
Howard, are you there?

216
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,390
Yeah, Pop.
What's going on?

217
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,309
Howard, I'm still in New York.

218
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,436
There's been some kind
of terrorist attack.

219
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,857
They're saying ballistic missiles
are headed toward the Gulf Coast.

220
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,026
- And the military is...
- (static crackling)

221
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,780
attempting to intercept...
my way... pick up your mom...

222
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,824
Dad? Hello?

223
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,621
Look, let me try back again
from the other phone.

224
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,706
Oh, my God,
I have to call my mom.

225
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,541
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead
and go call my dad.

226
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,877
I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
We just need to calm down.

227
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,837
Yeah, we don't even know
where the missile's headed.

228
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,006
You guys, we have to
pack our stuff and get out of here.

229
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,925
Baby, baby, hold on. No, no.
I just talked to my dad.

230
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,511
He said that the safest place to be
during an attack is in a rural area.

231
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,429
So we should just stay here,
wait for the military

232
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,848
- to launch its antideployment, okay?
- David: That makes a lot of sense.

233
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,809
Rural means fewer people.
It will be less of an impact.

234
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,104
So theoretically the worst place to be
would be a city like New Orleans, right?

235
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
Shit. My brother
is in New Orleans.

236
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,775
Baby, he's in the military, though.
He'll be fine.

237
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,320
- Why New Orleans?
- Yeah, guys, honestly, my vote is

238
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,406
let's just stay here,
let them blow that shit out of the sky

239
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,366
- and continue having a good time.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

240
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,577
- Yeah, and who said we were voting?
- David: Guys, that's not a bad idea.

241
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,538
We only have one car here.

242
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,498
We should probably decide
what to do as a group.

243
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,168
All right, all in favor of staying here,
raise your hand.

244
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,259
All right, and all in favor
of leaving?

245
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
Taylor, you have to vote.

246
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,017
I don't have enough data
to make an educated decision.

247
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,228
You don't have enough data?
This isn't a science class.

248
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,522
We need to vote right now,
'cause we have to decide what to do.

249
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,190
- I'm not voting.
- Okay, fine.

250
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,609
Three against two, though.
We're staying.

251
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,820
- Fine.
- Babe. Babe...?

252
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,282
- (David sighs)
- Naomi: Jesus, this is so crazy.

253
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,123
I wish we could at least find out
which way the missiles are headed.

254
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,208
I know. Me too.

255
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,376
(Howard belches)

256
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,253
I told my dad
not to get rid of the fucking TV.

257
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,464
Actually it wouldn't matter
if we had a TV.

258
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,799
Ballistic missiles
are radio-controlled.

259
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,719
They change directions at any time,
so the military...

260
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,055
they wouldn't even know
where they're headed.

261
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,640
What?

262
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,809
My brother's Recon
and he's a weapons freak.

263
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm gonna get some air.

264
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,734
(chimes jingling)

265
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,157
(sighs)

266
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,840
(loud whizzing)

267
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,009
(gasps)

268
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,681
- (explosion)
- Oh, my...

269
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,767
- Naomi: Oh, my God.
- David: What was that?

270
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,478
- Naomi: That's not good.
- Sharley: What was that?

271
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,021
Sharley:
Look at that.

272
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,482
Naomi:
What? Oh, my God.

273
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,529
Howard:
Shit.

274
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,699
Did you see it?

275
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,868
I saw everything.

276
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,371
Naomi: Oh, my God,
what is that?

277
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,835
- Sharley: Okay, Mom, I love you.
- Naomi: I don't know.

278
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,881
- I've never seen them so scared.
- Woman: You take care, Sharley.

279
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,302
My mom says
that it's all over the news

280
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,638
that one of the missiles
was shot down by fighter jets

281
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,808
and the other one self-exploded
in the sky over New Orleans.

282
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,895
See? What did I tell you, huh?
I knew they'd blow that shit up.

283
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,274
No, no, that's not true. Those jets
didn't do anything to that missile.

284
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,860
It was probably just like a mistake
in the reporting or something, babe.

285
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,122
(exhales)

286
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,708
This shit's crazy, man.

287
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,209
Hmm.

288
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,714
I'm gonna marry that girl.

289
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,716
Yeah, you should.

290
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,176
That way my best friend
can be my lawyer

291
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,095
and his girl can be my doctor.

292
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,514
Dude, she's not gonna be that kind
of doctor. I told you that.

293
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,558
Dude, get her
to change her mind.

294
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,727
There's way more money
in sports medicine.

295
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,855
I told you, dude,
she wants to save the world

296
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,773
and cure diseases.

297
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,567
And besides, isn't Naomi
gonna be a doctor?

298
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,820
- Don't you plan on having her around?
- Man, she's gonna be a dentist,

299
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,947
and God knows when.

300
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,283
Well, be thankful you have her, man.
She's a great girl.

301
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,535
Yeah, I am.

302
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,123
Dude, this whole thing
has really got me thinking, you know,

303
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,208
about, like, life.

304
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,796
You know, and it's not about
us graduating or...

305
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,717
or me starting my own law firm or
you being the first pick in the draft.

306
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,595
It's about having a drink
with my best friend.

307
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,682
- Yeah.
- Or going to dinner with my girlfriend.

308
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,977
I want to start enjoying those moments
that I have right now.

309
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,438
And then one day
I want to sit back

310
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,815
and I want to watch
our kids play together.

311
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,776
And I want to enjoy
those moments too.

312
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,987
Wow.
That was really deep, man.

313
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,323
Dude, but you know
how I get sometimes.

314
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,534
Tomorrow isn't promised.
That missile could have hit anywhere.

315
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,828
And it didn't.

316
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,873
I mean,
and we're alive right now.

317
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,586
Sharley:
I think I'm in love, Taylor.

318
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,463
Oh, my God. With Howard?

319
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,341
- Yeah.
- Okay, don't get me wrong.

320
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,551
I think he's really cool,

321
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,180
but he just seems like
a wild and crazy boy.

322
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,224
(both laugh)

323
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,809
Yeah, he is.

324
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,311
But that's just when he's
around everybody else.

325
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,022
When it's just the two of us,
he's really sweet.

326
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,109
And plus, I know he's gonna be
a great guy someday.

327
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,529
And he speaks
three languages.

328
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,656
And he's funny.
And he's smart.

329
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,450
- And he's pompous.
- Oh, come on.

330
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,870
You know,
I'm not perfect either.

331
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,706
So we can grow together.

332
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,793
Weren't you the one who told me
that he was afraid of commitment?

333
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,045
Okay, come on,
stop giving me a hard time.

334
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,256
The reason I'm telling you this
is because after school

335
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,258
we plan on moving in
together.

336
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,801
Oh, really?

337
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,887
I've just never met anybody
who makes me feel the way he does.

338
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,351
So how about you and David?

339
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,396
David is...
he's a really great guy.

340
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,398
But?

341
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,568
But sometimes I feel

342
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,571
smothered in his protection

343
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,323
and perfectness.

344
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,743
And he...

345
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,911
he gave me a ring.

346
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,371
An engagement ring?

347
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,081
No, no, no, no. God, no.

348
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,916
No, a...

349
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,752
Oh, cute.

350
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,921
A promise ring. I know.

351
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,926
Now... now what do I say
after that?

352
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,221
(growling)

353
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,894
Look at that dog.

354
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,520
What's he doing?

355
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,814
- (growling)
- (door opens)

356
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,027
What the...? What?

357
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,447
- David: Nice dinners, a lot of sun.
- Sharley: Guys, come over here.

358
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,616
- Brice: And a lot of sex.
- Sharley: There's a dog.

359
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,162
What the fuck is that?

360
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,789
- Brice: Okay, who brought the dog?
- (door opens)

361
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,541
(growling)

362
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,259
- What the...?
- Stay back.

363
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,978
(all screaming)

364
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,106
Taylor: Get inside. Close the door.
Close the door. Close the door.

365
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,778
- Oh, my God.
- Shut the fuck up.

366
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,781
(clock chiming)

367
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,616
Shh.

368
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,999
- (barking)
- (all scream)

369
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,168
Hey, guys, what's going on?

370
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,170
- It's a fucking dog, dude.
- A fucking dog?

371
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,840
It's not just a fucking dog.
He's got, like, rabies or something.

372
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,133
- All: Whoa. Don't open the door.
- What? I was just gonna look.

373
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,677
Oh, my God.

374
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,932
Okay. Okay.

375
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,101
Guys, it's getting dark

376
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,104
and apparently we have a crazed dog
stalking the premises,

377
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,147
so why don't we just lock up the fort
and call it a night?

378
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,399
- Women: Yeah.
- Okay?

379
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,862
Yeah, so it is,

380
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,030
yeah, right here.

381
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,328
There they are.
Do you have pillowcases?

382
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,540
Yeah. You know what?
They should be on the bottom shelf.

383
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,166
- Bottom?
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,710
All right.

385
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,588
- Um...
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,047
I don't see any.

387
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
They're there.
Look... look all the way back.

388
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,885
- All the way.
- Up here?

389
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,386
Mm-hmm, yeah.

390
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,055
You know what?
They're under the pillow.

391
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,725
Of course.

392
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,811
Here they are.
I need a...

393
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,939
- What are you doing?
- Wow.

394
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,025
Wowee, you have amazing skin.

395
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,986
- Have I ever told you that?
- Naomi: Are you crazy?

396
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,363
Why is everybody
always asking me that?

397
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm just trying to have
a little fun.

398
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,075
Seriously, Howard,
do you realize

399
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,785
how inappropriate
your behavior is right now?

400
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,370
Howard:
What are you talking about?

401
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,789
(sighs)
God.

402
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,293
- Want to punish me?
- You know what? Fuck you.

403
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,254
(door slams)

404
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,757
(dog growling)

405
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,099
(growling continues)

406
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,894
(rattling)

407
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,529
Baby, do you hear that?

408
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,073
- David.
- Hmm?

409
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,491
Do you hear that?

410
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,618
It was nothing, babe.
Go back to sleep.

411
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,870
- (dog growling)
- (sharp bang)

412
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,170
(growling continues)

413
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,427
(birds chirping)

414
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,262
(chimes tinkling)

415
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,145
(both chuckle)

416
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,190
Naomi: Thank you.
So what's up for today?

417
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,984
You want to go swimming
or what?

418
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,986
Brice:
Sure, I'm up for that.

419
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,699
Naomi: I'm glad we're finally here.
It's so beautiful.

420
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,701
Thanks for breakfast.

421
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,328
- What?
- What the fuck?

422
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,955
(growling)

423
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:17,127
Oh, my God.
It looks scarier than before.

424
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,923
All right, fuck it.
That's it.

425
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,758
Wait.

426
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:31,099
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna put him out of his misery.

427
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,643
Brice, no.
I have a really bad feeling about this.

428
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,979
Hey, please don't go out.

429
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,648
David, wake up.
Brice is trying to go outside

430
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,483
and that dog from last night
is still out there, you guys.

431
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,696
Please get up.
Hurry.

432
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,490
Howard: Oh, really?
The stupid dog again?

433
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,538
Dude, come on.
I got a bat. You want that?

434
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,832
- Yeah, let me get that.
- All right.

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,877
I don't know about this.
Maybe we don't do this and call...

436
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,046
- Animal Control.
- Yeah, Animal Control.

437
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,468
Brice.

438
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,471
I just want you to know
I think that this is completely stupid.

439
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,182
All right.

440
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,350
- (growling)
- (flies buzzing)

441
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,853
(chimes tinkling)

442
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,958
Naomi:
Brice, don't!

443
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,168
(snarling)

444
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,671
Whoa.

445
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,174
Brice!

446
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,301
- (dull thud)
- Oh, shit.

447
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,141
(flies buzzing)

448
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,522
Oh, shit.

449
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,068
My dad's gonna blame me
for that shit.

450
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,903
I think I broke his neck.

451
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,863
Good. I hope it hurt like shit,
you little fuck.

452
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,741
- Don't say that. He was probably sick.
- You see what he did to my stairs?

453
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,369
All right, the show's over, guys.
Let's throw this dude in the trash can.

454
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,621
What? No. We're not gonna
throw him in the trash, dude.

455
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,123
What if this was your dog?

456
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,835
- (snarls)
- (all yelp)

457
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,461
(dog squeals)

458
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,547
(Howard grunts)
Ugh!

459
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,805
Oh.

460
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,146
There's an address on here,
but no phone number.

461
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,565
Now I'll just drive it into town

462
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,567
and take it to Animal Control
or something.

463
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,485
Do you have any plastic?

464
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,946
- Yeah. Hang on.
- Brice: Oh, my God.

465
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,032
- I knew I heard something last night.
- David: I'm so sorry.

466
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,411
(door closes)

467
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,163
That was horrible.

468
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,957
Brice, do you mind if I borrow
Naomi for a minute?

469
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,500
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

470
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,502
Girl stuff. You wouldn't want
to be bored.

471
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,630
- I'll be right up.
- All right, baby.

472
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,841
Hey, what's up?

473
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,593
What's going on?

474
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,970
- With what?
- With you and Howard.

475
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,763
Me and Howard?
What are you talking about?

476
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,348
Oh, don't act dumb.

477
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,434
I stood here last night
and heard you guys upstairs.

478
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,728
And he's been acting really weird
since yesterday.

479
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,272
Sharley, there's nothing
going on with us.

480
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,734
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

481
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,777
um, I'm just gonna go.

482
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,654
No, please stay.

483
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,407
I think you've heard
most of it already anyway.

484
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,451
So what's going on?

485
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,746
Okay, you guys, let's just go outside.
We'll talk about this in private.

486
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,248
Okay.

487
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,461
Man on radio:
And as reported earlier, the hospitals

488
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,464
are filling up with patients
with a kind of unusual infection.

489
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,133
The symptoms are vomiting of blood,
lack of muscle control.

490
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,261
WZME advises all listeners
to stay indoors,

491
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,096
keeping all dogs and cats
on leashes,

492
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,642
and reminding you
to have a nice day.

493
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,685
Taylor: Just tell us
what happened.

494
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,191
It happened
at the Sigma party.

495
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,528
Honestly, Sharley,
I didn't mean for it to happen.

496
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,658
I was really drunk
and he basically took advantage of me.

497
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,034
Whoa, did he force
himself on you?

498
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,161
No, no, it's not exactly
what I'm trying to say, but...

499
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,871
What are you saying?

500
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,545
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

501
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,839
Oh, stop it.

502
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,384
You disgust me, both of you.

503
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,594
And for months you pretend?

504
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,680
(sniffling)

505
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,265
Fuck you.

506
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,892
You're calling yourself my friend
and fucking my boyfriend.

507
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,770
And fuck him
for being the liar that he is.

508
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,691
He probably just wanted
to come here and see you.

509
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,735
Sharley, please listen to me.
Do not tell Brice.

510
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,737
I'm begging you.

511
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,990
Please let me talk to him first.

512
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,995
Don't you dare say another word
to me all day, you hear me?

513
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,376
(radio beeping)

514
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,547

Excuse me, ma'am,
are you all right?

00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,769
(snarling)

531
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,162
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh.

532
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,333
(David panting)

533
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,252
(tires screeching)

534
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,837
Get off, get off, get off!

535
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,507
(David yelping)

536
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,145
Guys, guys!

537
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,193
Guys, guys!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

538
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,361
Howard:
Yeah, we're in here.

539
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,363
- Guys, where are you?
- Taylor: Whoa. What's going on?

540
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,156
Guys, pack your shit.
We are getting the fuck out of here.

541
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,784
Something really fucking weird
is going on. Baby, baby, baby,

542
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,494
go get the car.
I'm gonna go get our shit.

543
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,329
- We gotta get the fuck out of here.
- Why?

544
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,165
The radio said this whole fucking area
is quarantined.

545
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,043
Like, some kind of biological weapon
or some shit like that...

546
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,837
Then how can we leave
if it's quarantined?

547
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,547
No, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

548
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,841
It's not about how can we leave.
We have to leave.

549
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,385
Okay, if the roads are blocked,
then there's no point in us leaving.

550
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,470
No, no, no, David's right.
We should just go.

551
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,639
And if we get to a roadblock,
then we'll decide what to do.

552
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,850
No, they don't let people
in or out during quarantine.

553
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,893
I don't give a fuck
if they don't let people out!

554
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,563
You didn't see what I just saw!
We have to leave!

555
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,730
What about the infection?

556
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,233
We just need to all stay inside.
That way we don't get it.

557
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,068
- No, we are leaving.
- Look, look...

558
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,029
Guys, guys, hey!
No one is going anywhere.

559
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,948
If the area is quarantined,
we can't fucking...

560
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,908
- (snarling)
- (all screaming)

561
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,412
Howard:
Help! Help! Help!

562
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,540
- Brice: Help me get him!
- Taylor: David!

563
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:04,010
Howard!
No! No!

564
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,430
- Taylor: Sharley, no!
- Get off of me!

565
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,557
- Naomi: Sharley.
- Back up, Sharley.

566
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,058
(women shouting)

567
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,227
Get off of me!

568
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,688
Back the fuck up.

569
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,857
No. Howard.

570
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,571
- Sharley: No.
- Oh...!

571
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,448
Get off of me!

572
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,409
No. No. No. No.

573
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,416
No. No. Baby. Baby.

574
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,126
No.

575
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,712
Oh, my God.

576
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,760
Holy fuck. Holy fuck.
Dude, get up.

577
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,972
Run! Run!

578
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,478
Oh, my God!
(screaming)

579
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,442
Taylor: Go upstairs...
the attic. Go.

580
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,320
Sharley!
Oh, my God, Sharley!

581
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,324
- We have to go. Sharley, please.
- Get off of me!

582
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,992
Get off!

583
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,248
- (snarling)
- Oh, my God! Go!

584
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,169
Naomi:
Go.

585
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,133
No. Open the door.

586
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,720
Sharley, open the door.
Sharley, let me in.

587
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,305
Sharley, please!

588
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,807
(screaming)

589
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,892
(Naomi screams,
crunching)

590
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,103
Naomi: No!

591
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,854
- Naomi!
- Brice, fucking don't.

592
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,024
Stop.

593
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:48,406
(Naomi screaming)
Please!

594
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,033
(grunting)
Get off!

595
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,619
(Naomi screams)

596
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,373
- (screaming stops)
- (snarling)

597
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,622
(panting)

598
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,868
I have to go check.

599
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,371
They're still gonna be there.

600
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,087
Taylor: Why are they standing
frozen like that?

601
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,008
That's how the lady
in the road was.

602
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,177
And when I talked to her,
she went crazy.

603
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,269
You know, they said on the radio
that the infected people

604
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,563
might spread the disease
through body fluids.

605
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,857
Body fluids?

606
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,608
Yeah.

607
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,821
So the dog from yesterday
and the people...

608
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,033
it must be some kind of
zoonosis disease.

609
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,243
What is that?

610
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:43,205
It's any infectious disease
that can be transferred

611
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,917
from humans to animals
and vice versa.

612
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,006
So if we get attacked
by an infected person

613
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:55,009
or animal,

614
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,595
we could become infected?

615
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,515
I don't know.

616
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,895
So it's kind of like rabies.

617
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,773
Yeah.

618
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,693
Only whatever was in that missile
is so much worse.

619
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,989
(faint growling)

620
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,929
(wood creaking)

621
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,025
Taylor...?

622
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,986
Sharley:
Guys. David...?

623
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,988
Did you guys hear that?

624
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,618
Sharley:
You guys...?

625
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,579
I think that's Sharley.

626
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,997
Sharley:
Are you there?

627
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,250
(low snarling)

628
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,798
(whispering)
Taylor.

629
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,724
- (pounding)
- (Sharley gasps)

630
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,067
(screams)

631
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,319
Leave me the fuck alone!

632
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,030
Alone!
(sobs)

633
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,870
- Taylor: Sharley, over here.
- David: Sharley, we're over here.

634
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,164
- David: You have to run.
- Taylor: Over here.

635
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,376
- Taylor: Get in here. Get in.
- Brice: Hurry. Try to be quiet.

636
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,295
- (sobbing)
- Taylor: It's okay.

637
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,925
It's okay. Shh, it's okay.

638
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,260
Where's Naomi?

639
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,975
(Sharley sobbing)

640
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,651
David:
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,154
Brice: Just tell us
what happened, okay?

642
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,574
What happened?

643
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,409
What happened to her?

644
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,370
I can't talk about it right now.

645
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:32,249
Sharley, I just want to know
what happened.

646
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,209
I can't handle this right now.

647
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,670
- Just fucking tell me, all right?
- (sobbing)

648
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,756
Just tell me, all right?

649
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,685
She was my girlfriend.

650
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,271
Sharley:
Howard was my boyfriend.

651
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,693
Sharley...

652
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,946
just... just tell us
what happened, okay?

653
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,365
Just tell us
what happened. Try.

654
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,204
I was downstairs.

655
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,375
She came back for me.

656
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,462
And we ran to the stairs.

657
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,341
And by the time we got to the stairs,
those people were in the house.

658
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,718
And then

659
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,262
I was in front of her
and she was behind me.

660
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,516
And... and one of them
just grabbed her.

661
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:34,520
And then... then
I couldn't do anything.

662
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,899
I just ran into the room
and I shut the door

663
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,986
and I locked it
and I tried to be quiet.

664
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,530
(sobbing)

665
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:47,324
Are you sure
that's how it happened?

666
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,456
Yes.

667
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,132
Why wouldn't I help her
if I could?

668
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,175
Guys, listen,

669
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,594
this isn't gonna get us
anywhere, okay?

670
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,973
Okay?

671
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,600
We have to get out of here.

672
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,196
(snarling)

673
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,827
(birds chirping)

674
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,764
I got it.

675
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,808
Got what?

676
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,354
What I should have said to you
when I gave you that ring.

677
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,693
No matter what happens,

678
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,987
you can always count on me.

679
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,156
I'll be there for you...

680
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,618
each and every day.

681
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,414
Yeah, that's what
I should have said.

682
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,917
That would have been
the right thing to say.

683
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,715
Don't worry, baby.

684
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,468
Search and rescue
is gonna be looking for survivors.

685
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,637
We'll be out of here soon.

686
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,181
Brice:
No one is coming.

687
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,896
And we're all gonna starve to death
if we stay up here.

688
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,651
What are you saying?

689
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,571
I'm saying that those things
are still in the house.

690
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:52,366
And if we stay up here

691
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,952
with no food and no water,
we're all gonna die...

692
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,621
first David...

693
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,667
then me,

694
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,919
then Sharley

695
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,672
and then Taylor.

696
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,841
There is no search and rescue.

697
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,303
Then we have to leave.

698
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,477
How?

699
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,271
Fire escape?

700
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,064
Is that on the side
of the house?

701
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,108
Yeah.

702
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,777
Then, yeah.
We'll climb out of the window

703
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,988
and jump down
on top of the Jeep.

704
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,032
But first someone
is gonna have to go get it

705
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,076
and bring it around
to the side of the house.

706
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:39,997
Why me?

707
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,416
You just said if we all stay here,
we're all gonna die.

708
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,293
And what about me?

709
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,129
Taylor: You're the running back.
You're the best shot we have.

710
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,549
Hopefully they'll stay frozen.
Just be really quiet.

711
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,765
Okay.

712
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,560
All right, just...
just give me a second.

713
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,272
(exhales)

714
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,367
Give me the keys.

715
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,328
David: All right,
give him the keys, Taylor.

716
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,872
I don't know
where I put them.

717
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,124
- You what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

718
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,834
What do you mean, you don't know
where the keys are, Taylor?

719
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,004
I... okay, I had them in my hand
and then I put them on the counter.

720
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,048
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

721
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,384
Unless they fell
when those things came in.

722
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,261
Oh, my God, baby,
which one is it?

723
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,764
Seriously, think, think, think.
Do you specifically remember

724
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,766
putting those keys
on the counter?

725
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:44,228
Yeah... yeah,
they're on the counter.

726
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,855
Look, I don't know, Taylor.
What if they're not on the counter?

727
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,899
We have no choice.

728
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,819
She's right, dude. You know
what happens if we stay up here.

729
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,947
Yeah.

730
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,365
Come here, dude.

731
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,204
All right.

732
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,749
David: You're gonna have to run
to the kitchen,

733
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,751
grab the keys
off the counter, okay?

734
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,795
These guys are gonna be
chasing you.

735
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,421
You're gonna have to
sprint to the car.

736
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,173
When you get to the car,
you're gonna have to drive

737
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,592
a good distance down the road,
lead them away from the house.

738
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,636
And once you get there,
wait a minute

739
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,264
and then light the flare.

740
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,641
And as soon as I see the smoke,
I'm coming down.

741
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,602
I'm gonna be waiting for you
at the bottom of the fire escape.

742
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,940
- You got it?
- I got it.

743
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,032
Brice:
Okay, I'm going.

744
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,956
Be careful.

745
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,708
Yeah, okay.

746
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,378
(sighing deeply)

747
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,475
Please be careful.

748
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,189
(door lock clicks)

749
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,438
(floor creaks)

750
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,773
(snarling)

751
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,941
(panting)

752
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,615
Come on, man.

753
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,784
(banging)

754
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,831
(snarling,
banging continues)

755
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,272
(grunts)

756
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,667
(wood creaks)

757
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,853
Oh, fuck.

758
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,980
- (phone beeps)
- (continuous tone beeping)

759
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,648
Oh.

760
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,652
(winces)

761
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,404
(growls)

762
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,302
(engine starts)

763
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,804
Okay, we're getting the fuck
out of here.

764
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,475
(man snarling)

765
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,218
(softly)
Fuck...!

766
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,513
(tires screeching)

767
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,392
(grunts)

768
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,352
Oh, my God.

769
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,813
- He's not coming back.
- Shh. Quiet, Sharley.

770
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,024
He left us.

771
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,193
(panting)

772
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,756
David:
Shh. Quiet, Sharley.

773
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,259
- He left us.
- Sharley, shut up.

774
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,724
- He fucking left us!
- Sharley, shut the fuck up.

775
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,268
Sharley, shh. Quiet.

776
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,031
(fizzling)

777
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,538
Okay, there it is.

778
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,249
All right, I'm gonna climb down first
and help you girls down.

779
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,584
Okay.

780
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,592
(breathing deeply)

781
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,471
Hmm.

782
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,315
(snarling)

783
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,490
- Fuck you!
- (thumps)

784
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,700
Ooh.

785
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,713
- Brice: Come on, hurry.
- Okay, all right.

786
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,465
Brice:
Hurry.

787
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,551
Brice:
Come on.

788
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,804
- Come on, Sharley, come on.
- Okay.

789
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,015
Come on, Sharley, come on.
Come on, Sharley.

790
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,148
Sharley: Go get Taylor.
Oh, shit.

791
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,360
(snarling)

792
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,986
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck. Come on.

793
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,488
Come on, Taylor!

794
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,241
- Sharley: Oh, my God.
- David: Taylor!

795
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,909
Taylor, please, just jump!

796
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,745
Sharley:
Taylor!

797
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,914
Sharley: Oh, my God.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

798
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,709
- (people snarling)
- (women screaming)

799
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,930
Fuck!

800
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,561
- Argh!
- David: Brice, stop the car.

801
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,480
(screams)

802
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,274
Fuck, Brice.

803
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:10,900
Taylor, come on, go.

804
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,610
Go. Come on,
come on, come on.

805
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,904
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

806
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,828
Okay. Baby, baby,
are you okay?

807
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,705
- Are you okay? Okay.
- I thought...

808
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,249
- Quiet. Quiet.
- I thought he was gonna get me.

809
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,084
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

810
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:32,005
Shh. Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Shh. Shh. Quiet.

811
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,716
Sharley: Brice, just keep going
on this road about two more miles

812
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:38,011
and it's gonna hit the main road.
And that's gonna take us through town.

813
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,638
All right. Okay.

814
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,183
David:
It's okay. It's okay.

815
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,230
(tires screech)

816
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,992
Where is everybody?
There's no one out here.

817
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,171
- Brice: Oh.
- (screams)

818
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,924
Dude, look out!

819
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,852
(Brice groaning)

820
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,442
- Brice: Argh!
- David: Are you okay?

821
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,236
Brice: Oh, shit, my leg!

822
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,363
- (women whimpering)
- David: Can you move?

823
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,782
Sharley: Oh, my God.
I'm stuck.

824
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,034
- Guys, I'm stuck!
- David: Sharley, Sharley. Grab her leg.

825
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,495
- Sharley: Oh, my God!
- Sharley, I'm gonna pull your legs out.

826
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,831
Ready? Come on. One, two, three.
Grab the right leg.

827
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,749
- Pull that leg.
- (Sharley screaming)

828
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,584
Grab it right here.
Come on, grab that right leg.

829
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,795
- It's okay, Sharley.
- David, David, grab her.

830
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,047
(screams)

831
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,591
Taylor: Get her out!

832
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,134
Brice: We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

833
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,804
- Taylor: Hurry!
- (all screaming)

834
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,515
- Come on!
- Oh, my God.

835
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,351
- Taylor: Come on.
- David: Get up, get up. Go, go, go.

836
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,229
- David: Come on.
- (Brice grunting)

837
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,731
All:
Come on, come on.

838
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,259
- Over here.
- Go, go, go.

839
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,773
- David: Hurry up.
- (Brice grunting)

840
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,791
Women: In here.
Guys, get in here.

841
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,632
Brice:
Holy fuck. Shit.

842
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,017
Watch out. Watch out.

843
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,353
(distant snarling)

844
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,407
Now what are we gonna do?

845
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,992
(Brice moans)

846
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,579
We gotta do something about his knee.
I mean, that looks bad.

847
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:55,708
Yeah. Okay, I need something
to wrap it with... anything.

848
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,587
Here. Here.

849
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,631
Perfect.
Okay, now I'm gonna need

850
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,716
something to sterilize
the wound...

851
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,260
antibiotic, alcohol... anything.

852
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,014
Taylor:
Oh, God.

853
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,933
Brice:
I'll be all right,

854
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,018
but we need to figure
something out.

855
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,355
Okay.
Okay, what's our plan?

856
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,315
It'd be stupid to go back out there
with those things.

857
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,442
Let's stay here
and rest for the night.

858
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,777
But is he gonna be okay
with that knee?

859
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,113
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
We just need to find him

860
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,740
medical attention in the morning,
as soon as possible.

861
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,452
Do we even think there's anyone
out there normal like us?

862
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,956
Yeah, of course there's...
there's other people like us.

863
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,417
Yeah, can't be
the whole country's gone mad.

864
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,798
Look, you guys, you all try
and get some rest or something.

865
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,383
I'm gonna stay up
and keep watch.

866
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:48,011
What? Are you crazy? I'm not gonna
be able to sleep after all this.

867
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,303
Yeah, me neither.

868
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,097
Yeah, hell, no.

869
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,893
Well, try to get some rest, okay?

870
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,688
In the morning we'll head out
and find some help.

871
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,315
And what if there is no help?

872
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,614
(faint growling)

873
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,074
(panting)

874
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,454
(growling softly)

875
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,212
- (snarling)
- (screaming)

876
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,635
(panting)

877
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,223
Oh, my God.

878
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,892
Oh, my God.
Sorry, guys.

879
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,769
David:
It's okay.

880
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,647
It's just... it's just a dream.

881
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,233
It's just a bad dream.

882
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,738
Oh, my God, please tell me
this is all just a dream.

883
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,699
Taylor: Guys,
we should get going.

884
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,161
David:
All right.

885
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,664
(Brice grunting)

886
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,169
David: Dude, we gotta
get him out of here.

887
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,050
(grunting)

888
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,178
(creaking)

889
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,532
I don't see any of them.

890
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,451
You all ready to go?

891
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,911
Yeah.

892
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,169
(creaking)

893
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,884
(Brice grunting softly)

894
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,556
We should go there and find
something for Brice's leg.

895
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,391
No, let's keep going, you guys.

896
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,436
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Let's just keep on moving.

897
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,606
No, Taylor's right, man.
We gotta fix that leg up.

898
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,257
(doorbell chimes)

899
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,009
(recorded music playing)

900
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,492
Stop, stop, stop.

901
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,001
Stop.

902
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,335
- David.
- Stop.

903
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,132
Man on radio:

904

907
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,356

The university is located

916
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,426

- Taylor: Did you hear that?

917
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,594
Sharley: Oh, my God.

918
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,347
David:
All right, he said noon.

919
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,682
Let's grab what we need
and get out of here.

920
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,642
Yeah. Okay, we gotta get you
patched up. Come on.

(radio static hissing)

925
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,536
Guys, I really don't think
we have time for this.

926
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,873
Sharley, please, can you just
get us some hydrogen peroxide

927
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,209
and some bandages?
I'll be quick.

928
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,349
(grunts)

929
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,359
- Okay. Careful. It's gonna hurt.
- Argh. Shit.

930
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,486
Sorry.

931
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,494

932

(Brice wincing)

933
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,545
That hurts.

934
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,673
Ugh.

935
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:42,049
Sh-shit.

936
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,347
Oh!

937
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,982
Sharley:
Oh, Jesus.

938
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,236
Come on, we have to leave.
Make it quick.

939
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,992
Thanks.

940
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,370
You're gonna make
a great doctor.

941

(recorded music playing)

942
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:19,462
- Here you go. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

943
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,466
Dude.

944
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,471
Let me get that.

945
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,681
Hey, guys,
we gotta go to campus.

946
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,537
David.

947
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,540
Taylor: Hey, babe,
grab that can of aerosol.

948
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,927
(snarling)

949

(Sharley exclaims)

959
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,662
Go! Go, go, go,
go, go.

960
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,967
Go, go, go, go, go.

961

Sharley!

967
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,837
Sharley! No!

01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,924
Brice:
Come on! Go!

969
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,179
Let's get out of here.

970
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,391

Oh, my God.

01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,068
(Taylor sobbing)

973
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,332
Shh, shh. Hey, hey.
Shh, shh.

974
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,585
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay.

975
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,879
(crackling)

976
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:35,509
David:
Come on. Quiet.

977
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,142
(Brice grunting)

978
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,479

- Taylor: Oh, my God.
- David: Oh. Shh, shh.

980
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,997
Oh, fuck.
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Quiet.

981
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,707
(flies buzzing)

982
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,751
Another one of those
fucking frozen things.

983
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,879
Let's go back.
Let's go back.

984
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,547
No, no. Shh, shh, shh.
No way.

985
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,966
Let's just keep moving forward,

986
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,302
try and sneak past him
while he's still frozen.

987
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,346
Look, there's no way we're going back.
There's too many of them.

988
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,224
I think he's right.
There's just one of them.

989
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,435
We gotta go that way.

990
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,440
We cannot make
a fucking sound, okay?

991
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,859
- Okay.
- Not a fucking sound.

992
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,607
(flies buzzing)

993
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,919
- Oh, fuck.
- Shh, shh, shh.

994
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,880
We gotta go back.
We gotta go back.

995
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:40,008
Baby, we can't.
I mean, we're so fucking close already.

996
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,844
David, it's too dangerous.

997
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,554
We don't have enough time.

998
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,066
(tower bells ringing)

999
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,198
Baby, take this.

1000
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,825
- I love you so much.
- No.

1001
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:06,869
- Keep running no matter what.
- No. David.

1002
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,954
- Brice: Shh.
- (David screaming)

1003
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,417
(snarling)

1004
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:27,180
All right, all right, come on.
Go, go.

1005
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,891
Go.

1006
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:36,023
(car alarms blaring)

1007
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:51,079
- Come on.
- No. No, Brice.

1008
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,791
- Come on, come on.
- No, I'm not leaving without David.

1009
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,919
(car alarms blaring)

1010
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,207
David! David!

1011
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,584
- Brice: Come on, let's go.
- David: Run! Run!

1012
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,757
Brice:
He's coming.

1013
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,901
Taylor:
Come on! Come on!

1014
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,447
Come on, come on. Argh!

1015
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,825
Let's take the stairs.
Come on, go.

1016
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,868
(Brice grunting)

1017
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,662
David:
Here.

1018
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,456
Come on, come on.

1019
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,308
- (Taylor screaming)
- (Brice groans)

1020
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,020
- David: Get up.
- Taylor: Get up, Brice. Go!

1021
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,072
David:
Go.

1022
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,200
(David yells)

1023
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:58,165
Taylor: Help me with the bench.
Help me with the bench.

1024
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,125
Help me with the bench.

1025
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,919
(Taylor screams)

1026
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,761
David:
Baby...!

1027
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,804
(doorknob rattles)

1028
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,558
Brice:
David, are you all right?

1029
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,643
David.

1030
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,023
(David screaming)

1031
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,567
No. No!

1032
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,987
No! David!

1033
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:32,365
No!

1034
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:38,622
David!

1035
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,499
No!

1036
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:55,555
Baby.

1037
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,682
No! No!

1038
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,102
(snarling)

1039
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:12,697
No!

1040
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,283
Taylor:
No!

1041
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,969
(snarling)

1042
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,814
(Taylor screaming)

1043
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:52,737
No! No!

1044
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,616
(Taylor screaming)

1045
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,168
(screaming)

1046
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,094
(elevator bell rings)

1047
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,515
Come on.

1048
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,435
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

1049
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,061
Oh, God!

1050
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,656
- (recorded music playing)
- Brice: We need time to think.

1051
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,579
It's just not fair.

1052
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,873
It's just not... it's not fair.

1053
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,042
(sobbing)

1054
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,265
(growling quietly)

1055
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,486
(elevator whirring)

1056
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,823
I'm tired.

1057
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:01,992
Be strong. Let's get up.

1058
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,538
Brice: Fuck,
the power's back on.

1059
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:13,211
(snarling)

1060
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,674
(shouting)

1061
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:26,141
- (snarling stops)
- Brice, Brice.

1062
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,562
All right. Here, take this.
Throw this up first.

1063
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,275
All right, all right.
Give me the bag.

1064
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:37,152
I'll lift you up.

1065
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,282
(both grunt)

1066
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,617
Brice:
Got it?

1067
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,990
(radio beeping, hissing)

1068
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,080
Taylor:
Be careful.

1069
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,040
(quietly)
No, no.

1070
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,878
Taylor: He doesn't look
like one of them.

1071
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,428
(beeping continues)

1072
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,232
Oh.

1073
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,692
(helicopter blades whirring)

1074
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,661
Come on. Come on.

1075
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,247
Here!

1076
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,208
Here! Here!

1077
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:16,668
Here!

1078
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:19,045
- Brice: Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1079
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,214
Brice: Come here! Hey!

1080
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,010
Come back! Argh!

1081
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,680
You've got to be kidding me.

1082
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,849
The radio.

1083
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,939
Woman: Ultimate
emergency evacuation...

1084
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,774
- They're still here.
- ...will be on the top level

1085
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,236
- of the Southeast University structure.
- God damn it! Argh!

1086
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,532
Taylor: It's just across the street.
Let's go.

1087
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,297
(Taylor whispers)
Quiet.

1088
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,695
(whispering)
Brice, this way.

1089
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,910
Okay, come on.

1090
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,603
(whispers)
Wait.

1091
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,663
- We can sneak past them.
- No.

1092
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,665
Trust me.

1093
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:27,233
(shattered glass crunches)

1094
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:29,193
Go.

1095
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,239
(Taylor screams)

1096
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,255
(faintly)
Oh, my God.

1097
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:51,049
Oh, Okay.

1098
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,646
Taylor, come on.
What are you doing?

1099
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,522
Taylor:
Give me the lighter.

1100
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,072
Taylor:
Take that, asshole.

1101
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,240
Brice:
Shit. Come on.

1102
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,191
Brice, wait.

1103
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:55,822
(snarling)

1104
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,826
(whispers)
Brice.

1105
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,203
Brice:
I'm over here.

1106
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,664
- Taylor: Where?
- The next flight up.

1107
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:07,542
Taylor: Listen. I think they went
the other way.

1108
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,963
Here, take my hand.

1109
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:15,883
It's dark in here.

1110
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:24,934
Taylor: We can make it to the top
before they catch up.

1111
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,311
Brice:
Taylor, give me the lighter.

1112
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:38,072
Shh.

1113
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,241
(loud footsteps)

1114
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:47,749
- (loud bang)
- (lighter clatters)

1115
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,500
Brice:
Oh.

1116
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,799
(helicopter blades whirring)

1117
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,971
Hurry. Let's go.

1118
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:07,602
Look, almost there.

1119
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,232
Come on!
Brice, hurry! The helicopter!

1120
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,860
(snarling)

1121
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,661
Help! Come back!

1122
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,247
Wait! Wait!

1123
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,835
Please help us!

1124
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:38,508
Come back! Come back!

1125
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,065
Brice!

1126
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:00,738

(cocks gun)

1129
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,451
(gunshot)

1130
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,876
- Stand down.
- He's not infected.

1131
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,920
- Stand down.
- He's not infected. It's his own blood.

1132
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,550
Are you all right?

1133
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,094
If that's what you want to call it.

1134
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,266
Let's go.

1135
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,779
Can you hear me?

1136
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:07,615
Can you hear me? Ma'am!

1137
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,034
Sorry, we can't.
There's no more room.

1138
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,202
What?

1139
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,721
(Taylor screams)
Stop! Come back!

1140
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,015
Wait! Wait!

1141
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,852
Brice!

1142
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,077
No! Come back!

1143
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,996
Brice:
Wait!

1144
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,248
Man: Command one, command one,
