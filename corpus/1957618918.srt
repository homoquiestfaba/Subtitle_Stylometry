00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
You hungry?

184
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,000
You want some--
some breakfast?

185
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,233
My mom makes
the best waffles.

186
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,200
First...takes
a layer of batter.

187
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,300
Puts it
in the grill. Right?

188
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,367
Takes a layer
of peanut butter.
Puts that on top.

189
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,266
Another layer of batter.
Closes it up.

190
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,233
And when it comes out,
it's all crispy
on the outside,

191
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,767
but it's, like, gooey
and peanut-buttery
on the inside.

192
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,200
It's totally awesome.

193
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,867
I think
she invented it.

194
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,166
How old are you?

195
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,667
How old do you
think I am?

196
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,433
I'd guess, uh, 17.

197
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,367
19, tops.

198
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,834
No, man.

199
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,900
Look.

200
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,300
This says you're 31.

201
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,767
Oh, shit.

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,166
Yeah. It's all fucked up.

203
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,967
Well,
I'm old enough to vote.

204
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,367
[chuckles]

205
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,333
You want some of this?

206
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,967
No.

207
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,300
Breakfast's
my favorite meal.

208
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,800
My mom used to make a...

209
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,266
big breakfast for me
every Saturday morning.

210
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,433
Where do you live?

211
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,633
Uh, Ft. Irwin.

212
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,800
Before that, Ft. Benning.
Before that, Ft. Knox.

213
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,233
Ft. Knox
had the best women.

214
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,667
I live in Henderson.

215
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,233
You want to see
my home?

216
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,433
Is it cool?

217
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:01,166
Oh, it's beautiful.
[chuckles]

218
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,767
All paid for.

219
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,934
Thanks, but, you know...

220
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,166
I can't. I really can't.

221
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,266
And thanks for breakfast,
too.

222
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,367
But I gotta go
find a job today.

223
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,367
It sucks, yeah.

224
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:13,667
What-- What do you do?

225
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,700
Whatever pays.

226
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,467
Y-You don't say?

227
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,934
Well, I have some work

228
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,633
that needs to be done
on my home.

229
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:23,166
Perhaps we could
go there right now
and take a look.

230
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,367
I don't know.

231
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,033
Um...I really got
to, uh...

232
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,200
make some money,
fast, you know,

233
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
'cause I gotta
get to Charlotte,
North Carolina.

234
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,700
By this weekend. I'm gonna
be a race car driver. So--

235
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,200
[laughs]
Is this something

236
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
you've done before?

237
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,867
Sorta.

238
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,367
And...you need money

239
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,367
to get
to the race track.

240
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,300
I-- I follow you.

241
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,400
Well, I could
pay you well
for your labor.

242
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,300
Really.

243
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,867
Mmm.

244
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,200
Well, I mean...

245
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
as long as
you're paying me.

246
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,133
You know? As long
as I'm working for it.

247
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,633
I don't want no handouts.

248
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,200
Mmm, check.

249
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,333
You know, you wouldn't
believe the people

250
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,767
that I've met
since I've been here.

251
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,700
Bunch of losers.

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,533
[chuckles]

253
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,934
Normally,
I don't trust anybody...

254
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:15,333
over 25.

255
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,500
And I can tell
you're at least 30.

256
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,400
But, uh...
[chuckles]

257
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,300
uh, you seem cool.
You know, you seem
all right.

258
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,233
I appreciate that,
Johnny.

259
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,233
And I appreciate
your honesty.

260
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,233
And believe me,
I know what
you've been thinking

261
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,400
this entire time.
But you're wrong.

262
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
There are factors
involved here.

263
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,734
Hygiene, for one.

264
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,967
There's also the matter
of politics--

265
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,700
sex-- sexual politics,
which I don't care
to be a part of.

266
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
So what
I'm trying to say

267
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,500
is that every person
has a special thing
about them

268
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,300
that makes them
who they are.
Do you follow me?

269
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Yeah.

270
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,467
For instance,
you...are honest.

271
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,900
And that one thing
makes you who you are.

272
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,700
I tip well.
That's my one thing.

273
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:02,800
But we're also alike

274
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,767
in that we both
have special interests

275
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,467
that other people
don't have.

276
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,734
Uh, you want
to race cars,
Johnny.

277
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,700
And me?

278
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,266
Well, I'm...I'm

279
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,300
into something else.

280
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,500
I'll...
[squeak]

281
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,967
help you do
your thing

282
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:22,367
if you help me
do my thing.

283
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,900
Sound like a plan?

284
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,266
Stop the car.

285
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,633
Now, there's no need
to jump to conclusions.

286
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:31,567
Stop the fucking car!
All I want--

287
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,667
[tires screeching]

288
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,367
Uh, my stuff!
Stop! Stop!

289
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,200
Hell, you pervert!

290
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
Fuck!

291
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,734
Perverts and liars
and there's nothing
fucking left!

292
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,266
You wouldn't believe

293
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,900
what that guy
wanted me to do.

294
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,533
It was so disgusting!
I can't even--

295
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,233
I can't even believe it.
 He-- He wanted me to--

296
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,233
[sigh]

297
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,433
He wanted me...

298
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,266
Sit and bark
like a bitch?

299
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,600
God!

300
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,266
Don't even say it!

301
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,266
Uhh!

302
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:18,266
Yeah, that's Russel.

303
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,500
Big-time king.

304
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,367
What,
you know that guy?

305
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,533
Yeah. How much
was he gonna pay you?

306
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,834
Look, I didn't ask!
Hell, whatever it was,

307
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,533
it wasn't enough!

308
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:31,767
He was-- I--

309
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,233
I knew I shouldn't've 
trusted him.

310
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,066
I knew it. He was--
It-- He was 40.
At least 40.

311
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,567
God!

312
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,400
So, what are you
gonna do?

313
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,900
I don't know.

314
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,567
I don't know.
I'm total--
I'm fucked.

315
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,567
[sigh]

316
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,066
You wanna
hang out tonight?

317
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,400
Why? What do you
fucking want from me?

318
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,700
Nothing.

319
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,900
Just-- Just
thought you want--

320
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
might want to hang out
or something.

321
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,233
[sigh]
That's all.

322
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,033
[soft chatter]

323
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,166
[girl laughing]

324
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
[girl laughs]

325
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,734
[Boy] Shut up!
It's not funny.

326
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm in love.

327
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,533
All right,
it's obvious
the Pez Boy

328
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,834
has mad feelings
for this woman.

329
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:28,900
Damn right.

330
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,266
Wait. Is this the one
from that party?

331
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,734
Yeah, the last
desert party.

332
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,834
Her name's Tracy,
and she's totally the bomb
in every way.

333
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,433
She's a raver, like me.

334
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:40,600
Her favorite fruit
is gummy peaches,
like me.

335
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,934
And we both think
happy hardcore's
the ultimate.

336
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,433
But she's older.

337
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,300
I think she wants
to hang out,
but I can never tell

338
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,967
'cause she's always
fronting, dude.

339
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,600
How old is she?

340
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,300
She's 18
and a total hottie.

341
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,567
I've seen her.

342
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,266
I'd say she's a nottie.

343
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,834
Shut up, Eric!

344
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,333
[coughing]
Johnny.

345
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,400
How you living?
[laughter]

346
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,767
[girl laughs]

347
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,734
[coughing]
[laughter]

348
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,300
[coughs]

349
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,400
[laughs]

350
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Uh...

351
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,700
doing all right.
[laughs]

352
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,233
No, man.

353
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,233
You gotta say
something cool.

354
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,600
Like what?

355
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,934
Like "Living large."

356
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,600
Chillin'
like a villain.

357
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,367
[chuckling]
See, Johnny,

358
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,800
you got two things
to pick from.

359
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,400
"Living large"
and "Chillin'
like a villain."

360
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,967
So, Johnny...

361
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,400
how you living?

362
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Uh...

363
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,567
Living like a villain.

364
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,266
[laughter]

365
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,300
Hey.

366
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,333
[laughter stops]

367
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,633
Evening, losers.

368
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,867
Oh, shit. it's
only the president.

369
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:43,033
Get fucked in the ass
tonight, Eric?

370
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,767
Yeah, by your dad.

371
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,367
Bitch came twice.

372
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,667
[laughter]

373
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:52,066
Ladies. You don't
mind, do you?
No.

374
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,500
So, what are you boys
up to tonight?

375
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,233
Nothing illegal,
I hope.

376
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,500
[Scoob]
Oh, no.

377
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,233
Scoob,
you got a sec?

378
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,767
Naturally.

379
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,600
Hey, yo, yo, yo.

380
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,667
[Girl] Okay.

381
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,000
Check it.
Try and say "toy boat"

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,333
ten times really fast.

383
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,667
Toy boat, toy boat.
Toy boat, toy boat.

384
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,233
Toy boat, toy boat,
toy boat.

385
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,233
Toy boat, toy boat,

386
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,633
Toy boat.
[Girl]
You see, dude?

387
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,633
I want some, Steve.

388
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,934
The hell with that.

389
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,300
Toy boat.
Toy boat.
[laughs]

390
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,367
No way.

391
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,266
Haven't you guys got
some homework to do?

392
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,300
[Eric]
So, uh, Steven. Why
aren't you kicking it

393
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,533
at that rich trick's
place you keep
bragging about?

394
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:33,934
Because I had
other business

395
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,467
to attend to
tonight.

396
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,700
The streets
are changing,
man.

397
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,400
Those fucking Metro cops
are everywhere.

398
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Someone's putting pressure
on those motherfuckers

399
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,367
to jack the shit
out of us.
I don't know who,

400
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,467
but the shit's
getting serious.

401
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,033
I need a change
of scenery.

402
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,934
I'm thinking
about heading back
to La La Land.

403
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:50,400
What's
stopping you?

404
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,433
Some of us are making
too many duckies

405
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,266
to bail
at the present time.

406
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,333
But this bullshit
with the local law
enforcement

407
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,000
is seriously cutting down
on my disposable income.

408
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,467
What are you
so worried about?

409
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:02,734
You're gonna be
famous, right?

410
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,367
Working it as we speak.

411
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,834
Steve's gonna buy

412
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:06,900
a big house
in the desert

413
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,600
so he can
party every
fucking day.

414
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,467
[laughs] Parties
by the pool,
baby.

415
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,266
Right.
Did I ever
tell you

416
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,800
about that time
that rich trick
dragged me

417
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,467
out to that
crazy-ass pool party?

418
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,867
[laughs] Get this.
Bitch didn't even
want to fuck me.

419
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:21,500
Just wanted to hang out.
Picture me, sitting around,

420
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,367
buncha queens sipping
strawberry daiquiris,
piña coladas.

421
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,867
It was beautiful.
Scored a $200 tip
that night.

422
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,867
Wow.
Tell him

423
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:29,867
we need beer.

424
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,400
Oh. We need beer.

425
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,533
Somebody
hook us up?

426
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,333
I'll go.
Go to a place

427
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,700
behind the Flamingo
parking structure.

428
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,900
The Korean guy's down.

429
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Need a fake I.D.

430
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
[laughs]

431
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,867
All right.

432
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,934
Hey, I'm-a--
I'm-a go, too.

433
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,033
Cold weather's
bad for your kidneys.
Know that?

434
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,834
No.

435
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,767
I'm gonna die
if I don't get 
a six soon.

436
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,033
I'm gonna die
if I don't eat
something soon.

437
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,700
Hey, who--
who's that cute chick

438
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,934
sitting by Scooby?

439
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,066
Which one?

440
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,333
The real cute one.

441
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,633
Oh, that's--
that's Kelley.

442
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,066
She's a hottie.

443
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,800
I want to throw
a beat so bad. Uhh!

444
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,467
[laughs]

445
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,900
Hey, what was up
with that one guy, too?

446
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,333
Steven?
The dickhead?

447
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,700
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
Did he really do

448
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,333
all that shit--
Whassup, fools?

449
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,300
Whassup,
J.T.?

450
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,800
Not a damn thing.

451
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Who's this?
Whassup?

452
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,533
Oh, this is--
This is Johnny
from last night.

453
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,533
He's down.

454
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:33,633
You better be.

455
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,967
Jason Torres.

456
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,433
Hey, yo. J.T.

457
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:41,300
With cash money.
Got that?

458
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,633
Yeah, all right.

459
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,633
You got that?

460
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,033
What's up, men?
You guys hungry?
Thirsty?

461
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:52,367
Hey, I thought I told you
not to come in here anymore.

462
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,767
Go grab some of them bags
over there, man.

463
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:54,834
Whatever you want.
It's on me.

464
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,667
Get outta here!
I'm calling the cops!

465
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,333
I'm calling right now!

466
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,266
Hey! Now, I've
told you before!

467
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,734
You get the fuck
outta here!

468
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,700
Oh, fuck you, man!
I'm thirsty.
No, fuck you!

469
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,000
Fuck you!
I'm calling the cops!

470
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,467
I'm calling
the cops right now!

471
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,467
Hey, yo, man, O.E. cool?

472
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,033
Get your punk-ass
friends outta here!

473
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:14,333
You two! Get outta here!
Right now, God damn it!

474
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm calling
the goddamn cops.

475
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,367
I'm calling 'em
right now!

476
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,467
Get the fuck
outta here!

477
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,533
Where the hell
you think you're going?

478
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:26,000
Whoo!
Sorry! I can't resist
jackin' Chang!

479
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,367
[laughing]

480
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,300
Hey, I don't know
if you can
crash here tonight,

481
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,600
but you're totally welcome
to stay at my place
if you want.

482
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,533
Cool.
Thanks.

Hi.

00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Hi.

487
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,367
It's not a good
night tonight.

488
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:00,633
Larry's
gonna be off.

489
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,467
Can we just--
just hang out?

490
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:04,700
Uh...

491
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,967
Yeah. Come on.

492
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,900
H-- I'm Johnny.
Hi.

Hi.
Yeah, that's--

495
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:19,367
Oh. Uh...

496
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,266
make yourselves
at home.

Hey, Johnny,
come here.

Let me
show you something.

499
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,066
Hello?

500
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,367
Oh. Larry.
Hi.

501
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,500
That's my mom.

502
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,967
Wow. That's cool.

503
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,400
Where's she at?

504
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh, shit!

505
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,133
I forgot
to buy smokes.

506
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,300
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.

507
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
Listen.
I love you.

508
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,900
Look, I do!

509
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,266
I do. Uh, Larry,
please. Come back.

510
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,000
You're a new face
around here.

511
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,633
How come you're
not in school?

512
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Dropped out.

513
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,800
School sucks.

514
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
Where you from?

515
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,333
Ft. Irwin.
Before that,
Ft. Ben,

516
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,000
and before that,
Ft. Knox.

517
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,734
Ft. Knox had
the hottest women.

518
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,500
My dad's a colonel,
so...

519
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,333
It was kinda like
being in the army, so...

520
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,066
I got sick of taking
shit. I left.

521
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:15,533
What kinda shit?

522
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,900
Telling you what
to do all the time.

523
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,467
Telling you
how messed up you are.

524
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:20,433
Shit like that.

525
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,433
You know?

526
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,000
So you decided
it was time to leave
for good?

527
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,500
That's right.

528
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
[cups clunking]

529
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,333
Got any brothers
or sisters?

530
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,400
I got a sister.
She's younger.

531
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,333
She's one of the reasons
why I want to be
a race car driver.

532
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,700
I want to be able
to take care of her.
She's deaf.

533
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,767
Gonna be
a race car driver?

534
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,100
Yep. Stock cars.

535
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,700
That's why I want
to go to Charlotte.

536
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,533
That's where all

566
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,600
I want to tell you
a story, Johnny.

567
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,333
Right after I had
to stop dancing,

568
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,867
I went through
some really bad times.

569
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,433
This was
before my boyfriend

570
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,500
pulled me
out of all that shit
and saved my life.

571
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,667
But I thought the way
that you do now.

572
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,667
I thought I'd make
some easy money,

573
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,967
get a lot
of attention.

574
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,834
It was like that
for a while, too.

575
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,700
Anyway, this one night,
I was picked up
by this guy

576
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,433
in this brand-new
Ford Explorer.

577
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,667
It was
a really nice car.
You know?

578
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,934
He was in his late 30s,

579
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,467
and he said
that he was in town
for a couple of days

580
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,700
for some big computer
software convention

581
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,100
and he wanted
to have a good time.

582
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,633
So I asked him
what he was into,

583
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:35,667
and he said that he was
into killing people.

584
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,433
[chuckles]
I didn't pay attention
to what he said

585
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,533
'cause I knew
the guy was drunk.

586
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,667
He had a bunch of vials
in the backseat, and...

587
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,533
Anyway, uh, you know...

588
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,834
I figured he was
just trying to scare me.

589
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,333
I...heard that kind
of thing before.

590
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:56,734

on that kind of thing--

593
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:04,533
So I asked the guy, um,
where we were gonna go.

594
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:06,633
And he said that
it was a surprise,

595
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,700
and I said I really
didn't like surprises,

596
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,433
and that I'd feel
a lot better if he
just pulled over.

597
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:12,567
But he didn't.

598
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
So I, uh...

599
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,500
I knew he was
heading up the strip

600
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,400
towards the freeway,
and I had to do
something pretty quick,

601
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,367
so I told the guy
that I was a junkie

602
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,500
and if I didn't get
a fix real soon,

603
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,400
that I was gonna throw up
all over his brand-new
beautiful car.

604
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,734
And that did it.
So he pulls
into this little place

605
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,433
behind the gas station.

606
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:36,934
[teapot whistles]

607
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:39,166
So anyway,
I tell the guy

608
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,166
that I'm feeling
a little better

609
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,400
but that I still
need to fix up.

610
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,500
And he says okay,

611
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,734
but that he would like
to see what I look like
down there.

612
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:52,734
So he tells me
to lean back
and relax,

613
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,433
which I did.
And he tells me
to close my eyes,

614
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,400
which I did.

615
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,133
I don't even
really remember
what happened

616
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:00,734
that clearly,
but I was just--
I was

617
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:02,533
kicking him
and punching him
and hitting him.

618
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,367
And then I pushed
the door open on the car,

619
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,367
and then I started
running down the street.

620
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,500
I don't even remember
when I stopped,

621
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,533
but when I did stop,
I looked down,

622
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,467
and I noticed that
my jacket was torn.

623
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,567
And I look inside, and
there was blood everywhere.

624
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,667
I'd been stabbed
in the chest,

625
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,567
and I didn't
even know it.

626
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,000

so much adrenaline

627

that it took the pain away.

that the knife
had hit a rib

629

had just been
a little higher,

[laughs]

712
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,066
[laughs]

713
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,600
[both laughing]

714
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Oh...[laughs]

715
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,433
I was viral.

716
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,100
I'm-- I'm
 Wilma Garrett Price.

717
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,533
I'm-- I'm really sorry
for the display earlier.

718
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,100
Wilma.

719
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,400
Like The Flintstones. 
Yeah.

720
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,500
[both laugh]

721
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,066
Johnny.
It's nice to meet you.

722
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,700
Wait. Wait a second.
What time do liquor stores
close around here?

723
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,467
It's about 4
in the morning, right?

724
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,700
Uh...I--
'Cause I plan
to drink

725
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,433
about a thousand
wine coolers, so I--
I'd better run.

726
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,934
It was nice
talking to you.
Yeah.

727
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,166
Bye. [chuckles]

728
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,300
Do you drink
wine coolers?

729
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,166
When Pete's unit
got back two days ago,

730
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,467
he had already
made up his mind

731
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,533
without even talking to me
that right now

732
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,266
was the time
to officially tie the knot.

733
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,433
I mean, I wanted to
a year ago, but...

734
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,734
wasn't the right time
for him, so...

735
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:15,133
when he said,
"Let's do it,"

736
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,734
I mean, what was
I supposed to say?

737
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:17,967
"Let's wait
another year"?

738
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:21,100
Hell, no. I mean,
he had three days' leave.

739
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,000
Can you imagine that?
Three days,

740
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,433
and he's
right back out again.

741
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:28,600
I mean, I didn't have time
to prepare one little bit!

742
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,100
When we got
to the chapel
this morning,

743
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,066
there was all
these couples lined up.

744
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:34,033
[knocks bottle over]

745
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,433
So embarrassing.

746
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,567
See, I always
thought that...

747
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:45,000
when I finally married
the man that I love...

748
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,066
that it would be
something really special.

749
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:53,400
Not like this.
Not Las Vegas.

750
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:56,900
I mean, our families
weren't even invited.

751
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,767
'Course,
his buddies were here.

752
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,533
And to top it off,
they-- they insisted

753
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,934
on having
the bachelor party

754
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,900
and our honeymoon
on the same night.

755
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,433
Of course, the--
the party on the lake

756
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:11,000
was much more important
than spending the night
with his bride.

757
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,200
I mean, who cares
if we already live
together?

758
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,100
He didn't even
ask me how I felt.

759
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,200
And the funny thing
is that I...

760
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,300
I could live
without a fancy wedding.

761
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,200
I really could.

762
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,467
I just wanted us
to be alone tonight.

763
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:31,867
If you ever
get sick of him...

764
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,533
you come
to North Carolina
and live with me.

765
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,400
You're such an angel.

766
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,767
You really are.

767
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,900
Thank you.

768
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,700
I'm so glad we met,
Wilma.

769
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,967
Ever since I got here,
it's just been the worst
time of my life.

770
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:53,600
I got all my stuff
stolen.

771
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,800
All the people I've met,
every one of them,

772
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,200
has been crazy
in some way.

773
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
See? See?

774
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,166
This is what
I'm talking about.

775
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,567
He's been earning
hazardous duty pay
for months,

776
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,867
and what does he do
when he has time
to spend it?

777
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:07,567
Just leaves it right here
on the dresser.

778
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,500
[sigh]

779
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,800
I don't want to talk
about him no more.

780
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,567
Sure.

781
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,033
When's he getting back?

782
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,633
He's supposed to
have the boat in
by sundown tomorrow.

783
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:22,767
So we have plenty of time.

784
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,533
Do you want to...

785
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:36,767
take yours off now?

786
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:04,633
[kiss]

787
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,700
[sigh]

788
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,934
I'm all yours.

789
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,633
What do you
want me to do?

790
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,066
Well,
whatever you prefer.

791
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:21,467
I-- I trust you.

792
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:24,633
Just go slow
in the beginning, okay?

793
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,633
Okay.

794
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,633
Um...

795
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm sorry. Uh...

796
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,133
It's been, like...

797
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,000
I just don't want
to mess anything up.
[chuckles]

798
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Well, why don't you start
by taking the rest
of your clothes off?

799
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Sure.

800
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,200
Can I just
turn the light out?

801
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,867
If you want.

802
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:06,533
[bang, thud]

803
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:07,834
Hey, honey.

804
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,934
Let's...fuck.

805
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
Um...

806
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,533
Pete, uh, no.

807
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,900
No. No. No, no.
No, Pete. Pete.

808
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,600
Wait. Pete. Pete, no.
Wait. Wait, Pete.

809
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,834
It's your ass, honey!

810
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:21,800
Hi.
No! No!
Hi.

811
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,200
[Pete roars]

812
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,500
Oh, my God!
Come here,
you bastard!

813
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,567
Pete, no! No! Pete!
Unhh!

814
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:28,700
[choking]
Pete!

815
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,200
[gagging]
Oh, shit!

816
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,767
Pete, stop it!

817
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:35,467
Stop it, Pete!
Pete, be nice to him!

818
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,834
Pete, no!

819
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,533
No! Let him go!
You're fucked, kid.

820
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,033
Airborne qualified, bud.

821
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:42,166
Pete, stop it!

822
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,033
Force recon!

823
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,133
Eat some dirt!

824
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:47,667
Pete! Pete!

825
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:51,200
No!

826
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,100
[shards clattering]

827
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:09,533
[hinges creaking]

828
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:10,533
[door closes]

829
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:14,033
Is breakfast ready, Mom?

830
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:16,033
[birds chirping]

831
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:18,900
[sigh]

832
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,667
Nothing that terrible
could be real. Huh.

833
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,166
What are you
doing here?

834
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,233
I...I live here.

835
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,000
This is my place.

836
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:38,433
You, uh...don't
remember nothing?

837
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:41,233
Total blackout, huh?

838
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,166
Well, you want to
see something funny?

839
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,200
Look.

840
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:50,533
[sigh]

841
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:51,567
That's not funny.

842
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:53,200
I've seen worse.

843
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:57,166
Where's my shirt?

844
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,667
I tossed it.

845
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:00,600
You tossed my shirt?

846
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,834
Oh, you should've
seen it.

847
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,033
All covered
with barf bits

848
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,667
and blood samples
and shit.

849
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,066
Really gross.

850
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:08,600
The smell of vinegar
tutti-frutti, too.

851
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Uhh!

852
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,166
Before I woke up,
I was dreaming

853
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,834
that I was at home...

854
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,667
and my mom
made me breakfast.

855
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,000
It was so realistic.

856
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,633
You want breakfast?

857
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,800
I got
this cereal here.

858
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,567
I, uh...picked it up
because it has

859
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,200
a race car driver
on the front.

860
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,633
Ricky Rudd.
He's good.

861
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,200
You don't have to eat now
if you don't want to.

862
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,834
I could try.

863
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,000
Here you go.

864
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,834
[packaging
rattles]

865
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,533
Uh, that's what you
put your bowl on...

866
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:55,667
like a platform.

867
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:56,667
Oh.

868
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:59,166
Here you go.

869
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,066
I got you
a spoon here.

870
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,533
Oh, don't worry.
It's clean.

871
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,767
I jacked it
from MacDougal's
last night.

872
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,834
[sigh] And
I wasn't sure

873
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:13,934
what kind of milk
you wanted,

874
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:16,667
so I...I got you
lowfat.

875
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,166
It's-- You know,
it's usually
a safe bet.

876
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,600
But I can't drink
milk 'cause I got
that lactose disease

877
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,834
and I might die.

878
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,033
Eric.

879
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,633
I just want to say...

880
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:33,033
um...

881
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,200
I'm sorry
for what I said.

882
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
All right?

883
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,033
I really appreciate you
helping me out
and everything.

884
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,900
Ahh,
it's no problem.

885
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,767
I mean, I don't really
think you're weird
or whatever.

886
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:49,734
[chuckles]

887
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,200
I mean,
you never know.

888
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,967
I mean, I could try
knocking on you

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,533
[chuckles]

1062
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:44,834
Nice car, Scoob.

1063
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:46,166
What's up, Mickey?

1064
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,200
Yeah.

1065
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,367
What's up,
Trish?
Hey.

1066
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,767
New car, Scoob?

1067
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah. You like it?

1068
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,633
Yeah.

1069
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,700
So, I heard you
got beat down.

1070
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,767
I quote Tupac:
"Keep your head up.

1071
00:48:57,767 --> 00:48:59,066
Don't get fed up."

1072

[chuckles]
[sighs disgustedly]

1073
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:01,667

U2.

1075
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,700
Slade.

1076
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,900
Madonna.

1077
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,000
Give her to me,
Scooby.

1078
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,600
[sighs disgustedly]
Take it.

1079
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,800
Any other CDs
down there?

1080
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,100
Oh, dope.

1081
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,734
Let's go
for a ride,
kids.

1082
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:15,734
Shotgun.

1083
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:22,834
Hey, Johnny.
This is

1084
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,667
Mickey and Trish.

1085
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:26,667
Hello.
Hello.

00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,100
Guys, we roll
with this item.

1091
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,767
Yo, Scoob,
where we going?

1092
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,333
The desert.

1093
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,667
Cool.

1094
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,300
Here. You want
a cigarette, Johnny?

1095
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Yeah.

1096
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,300
Light?

1097
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,233
[clerk]
Hey, you gotta
pay for that!

1098
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:20,333
Mickey, get your ass
back in this car!

1099
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,734
Ohh! Damn it!

1100
00:50:24,734 --> 00:50:26,133
Come on,
little girl,
come on!

1101
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,667
What are you doing
with my CDs, girl?
Come on!

1102
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:29,633
Come on!

1103
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,000
We got screwed,
Scooby!

1104
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Where we going?

1105
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,633
Get us the hell
outta here!

1106
00:50:33,633 --> 00:50:35,667
Come on, Scooby,
get in this stupid car!

1107
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,333
Just trust me, all right?
Get in the backseat.

1108
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,333
Go! Go! Come on!
Come on, Scooby!

1109
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,133
Drop it!
Please hurry!

1110
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:43,333
Come on, Scooby,
let's go!

1111
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,333
[clerk] Hey!

1112
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,967
I'm calling the cops!

1113
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:47,200
I'm gonna find you!
[tires screeching]

1114
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,633
You and those other kids?
You better watch out

1115
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:49,834
'cause I'm coming
after you!

1116
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,834
Red light!

1117
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,300
Oh, stupid bitch!

1118
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,133
We're already
in a hot fucking auto!

1119
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,767
But, no, that's not
good enough for you.

1120
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:59,667
You gotta knock off
a fucking convenience
store, too?

1121
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:01,800
Uhh!

1122
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,033
Want a beer,
Scooby?

1123
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:04,867
Without a doubt.

1124
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:07,900
[tires screeching]

1125
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,266

Ohh! Ohh!

What are you doing?

1127
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:13,200
Aah! Slow down!

1128
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,700
All right?
Oh, God!

1129
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,166
On, no, no,.
no, no, no!

1131
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,667
Ohh!

00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:21,667
Oh, shit!

00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:23,767
Johnny, Slow down!
Johnny!

1135
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:26,700
If you're lucky!
[tires screeching]

00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,066
Whoo!
Oh, shit!

1137
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:31,800
Johnny!
Move the hell
over!

1138
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,633
This is not funny!

1139
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:34,767
[hollering]

1140
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:35,767
Will you slow down?

1141
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:37,233
Johnny!
Ohh!
[tires screeching]

1142
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:38,767

[Scooby]
It's not funny anymore!

1144
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,800
I'll get you,
you little thief!
Whoo-hoo!

1145
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,066
Stop
the fucking car!

1146
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:45,700
Asshole!
Oww!

00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:50,200
Whoo-ooh!
Ohh!

1149
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,300
Oh, shit, Johnny.

1150
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,900
Oh, spun out in front!

1151
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, God! What are
you doing, Johnny?

1152
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,200
Leave
this motherfucker!

1153

Ohh! Aah! Come on!

1158

Aaahh!

00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,934
Ahh!
Go, go, go!

1161
00:52:10,934 --> 00:52:12,066
Fuck! Fuck!

00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Gahh!

1164
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,867
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1165
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,600
I'll knock off the asshole!
Pull over!

1166
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,166
Ohh...
You're gonna
miss the light!

1167
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,667
Go, go, go, go.

1168
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:26,734
Ohhhh!
Go, Johnny, go!

00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,700
Hey, John boy...
Yeah.

1174
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,767
You can drive
my car anytime.

1175
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:53,233
Thanks.
[chuckles]

1176
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:54,667
Last beer. Any takers?

1177
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,166
Nah.
I'm cool.

1178
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,700
Hey,
I'm gonna go
for a walk.

1179
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
All right.

1180
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,767
I'll come.

1181
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,900
Coming,
Scoob?

1182
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,166
Nah. I'm gonna
stay here

1183
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:06,667
and smoke this
sticky shit.

1184
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:07,667
All right.

1185
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:09,867
[vomiting]

1186
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:11,200
[coughing]

1187
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,734
[Eric]
So did you ever
have a girlfriend?

1188
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,834
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1189
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:18,333
Did you?

1190
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:22,700
Oh, yeah. [laughs]

1191
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,467
Yeah, I forgot
about that.

1192
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,700
When did you
first, uh...

1193
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,900
like, realize?
You know,

1194
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,533
when did you
first know
that you were...

1195
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:36,033
Um, when I was
in the second grade,

1196
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:38,867
I-- I kept trying
to kiss all the boys
in my classroom.

1197
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:41,266
[chuckles]

1198
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:42,767
And, you know,
I got in trouble

1199
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:43,800
all the time,
too.

1200
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,133
But one day,

1201
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,834
my teacher
called my mom in
for a conference

1202
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:49,800
and told her
that I was confused

1203
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,800
because I kept walking
into the girls'
bathroom.

1204
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,266
And my mom, she, um,
she was totally
embarrassed

1205
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,767
and didn't let me hang
with any other kids
in the neighborhood

1206
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,834
for a long time.

1207
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:02,233
You know. She--
She was just
really scared.

1208
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:07,900
Anyways, my mom
left me when I was 10.

1209
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,834
And I went to live
with some other people.

1210
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,200
And it only got worse.

1211
00:54:14,734 --> 00:54:16,367
When was the first time
you boned a chick?

1212
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:17,967
None of your business.

1213
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:19,767
Come on.
I just told you

1214
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,967
my whole personal
private experience.

1215
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,734
It's no big deal.

1216
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:25,700
I'll tell you
whatever you want
to know about me.

1217
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,800
Don't want
to know nothing

1218
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,767
about being...gay
or whatever.

1219
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,166
Fine.

1220
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:34,000
Just tell me,
and I won't
bug you anymore.

1221
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,333
Was she--
Was she fat?
Was she skinny?

1222
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,033
Uh, hairy?
Or hairless?

1223
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:39,400
Or--
Shut up! I'll--

1224
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:43,800
If you promise not
to tell anybody,
I will tell you.

1225
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,800
All right?

1226
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,934
Promise.

1227
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:50,767
I have done...
stuff

1228
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:52,700
with women before.

1229
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,700
All right,
but I've never...

1230
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,333
actually completely
gone all the way.

1231
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:00,834
You're a virgin?

1232
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:02,166
No. No.

1233
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,767
I mean,
I wouldn't say that.

1234
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,367
I'd-- Like I said,
I've done stuff
with girls before.

1235
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:07,900
I mean, that should--
that should...

1236
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,667
cancel out the fact
that I've never

01:40:12,233 --> 01:40:13,967
and pro chief Jerry Powell 
 looking worried.

2106
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,400
Oh, you bet he is, 
 partner.

2107
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,266
With 3/8 of a second 
 to gain,

2108
01:40:17,266 --> 01:40:19,867
this has got to be 
 picture perfect.

2109
01:40:19,867 --> 01:40:21,333
Harley Hebert's crew chief

2110
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:23,467
has just signaled his driver 
 into the pit,

2111
01:40:23,467 --> 01:40:25,433
and w-- 
 Wait-- Wait a second.

2112
01:40:25,433 --> 01:40:28,367
Looks like we got a tire 
 rolling into pit row.

2113
01:40:28,367 --> 01:40:29,667
That's 
 exactly what it is,

2114
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:31,600
and one of the crew 
 is running over

2115
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,233
to deal with it 
 right now.

2116
01:40:33,233 --> 01:40:34,700
I wish I could 
 see the expression

2117
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:35,867
on Jerry Powell's face.

2118
01:40:35,867 --> 01:40:37,800
That boy earned his 
 six-pack for the day.

2119
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,233
That was a seriously 
 close call.

2120
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:40,633
Didn't hurt 
 their time much.

2121
01:40:40,633 --> 01:40:42,300
Well, Hebert's team 
 did lose

2122
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,433
a little time 
 at the pit...

2123
01:41:31,934 --> 01:41:34,834
