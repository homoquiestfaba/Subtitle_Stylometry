- So far, so good.

105
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,133
- I don't see anything
so we should be straight.

106
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,630
- So, let's see what's
inside this safe deposit box.

107
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,223
- Oh, no, this mine right here.

108
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,540
- Not much cash in here though.

109
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,733
Like 250, maybe three.

110
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:29,607
- Benny said, "It should be
more than cash in there."

111
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,494
(coins clink)

112
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,874
So, I guess he was talking
about these gold coins.

113
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:37,707
(coins clink)

114
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:39,743
I wonder how much these are even worth.

115
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:41,940
- And they look rare.

116
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,011
They're definitely worth some cheese.

117
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:46,000

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,063

119
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,293
A flash drive?

120
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,073
I wonder what's on this.

121
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,690
- Probably, some kiddie porn or some shit.

122
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,150
You know rich people be
into all kind of wild shit.

123
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,069
Look at this gold 45!

124
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,543

125
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:06,043
Aye, we got a laptop here, don't we?

126
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:07,130
- Yeah, I got one.

127
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,520
I just gotta charge it up.

128
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,223
- All right, I'll just check this later.

129
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:15,283
- What's this?

130
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,610
Crew, look.

131
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,780
Look at these.

132
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,630
- Oh my God!

133
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,820
- Diamonds are forever

134
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,386

135
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,219
Let me see them.

136
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,540
- Here, girl.

137
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,830

138
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,663
Bro.

139
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,163
Aye, who's box did we hit?

140
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,170
- I don't even know.

141
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,060
Benny said, "It was some drug
dealer from North Florida."

142
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,710
Nobody we would be familiar with.

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,740
- A hustler hiding cash,
coins and diamonds in Detroit?

144
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,253
Nah, that ain't the normal dealer.

145
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,670
- I mean, it's hard to hide
millions of dollars in cash.

146
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,710
I mean, sometimes, you
gotta convert the cash

147
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,030
into smaller valuable items.

148
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,313
There's nothing more
valuable than diamonds.

149
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,820
- Aye, man, I think this
might be the biggest lick

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,440
we ever hit.

151
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,283
- For real.

153
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,263

154
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,210
- Gimme a minute to change
with your little nasty ass.

155
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,043
- I'm serious.

156
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:22,907
It's my first time meeting him,

157
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:24,599

159
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:26,972

00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:37,097
- [James] Baby, why you
ain't come talk to me?

184
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,400
- Let me get to work.

185
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,370
- [Woman] James, I tried to-
- Hello.

186
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,203
- Hey, Benny.

187
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:44,036
How are you?

188
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,593
- Yeah, I'm good.

189
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:48,443
I was caught up a little bit earlier.

190
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,610
What that bag look like?

191
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,870
- Good as hell.

192
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,000
300 in cash, some gold coins,

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,230
something real special.

194
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,380
Take a look at the pic.

195
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,975
- Damn, them some big shiny rocks.

196
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,480
How many of them is it?

197
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,650
- [Nola] 20 of them?

198
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,850
You got a buyer in mind?

199
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,220
- A couple Jewish dudes
I can reach out to.

200
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,359
Don't worry, they getting sold.

201
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,430
When y'all leaving out?

202
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,520
- We're ready and packed.

203
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,050
First thing in the morning,
we're hitting the road.

204
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,180
- All right, cool.

205
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,393
Send me a pic of them
coins too, front and back.

206
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:27,220
I'll have my Jewish guy working on a quote

207
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,470
for them and them stones.

208
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,360
Good job, my baby.

209
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,837
Now, whose safety deposit
box you had the info on?

210
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,571
(dramatic music)

211
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,980
- Polo has arrived.

212
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,200
Shall I tell him you'll be down shortly?

213
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,890
- No send him in.

214
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,763
- As you wish.

215
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,313
- Polo, you may come up.

216
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,000
(footsteps thudding)

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,260
- Polo, what are you doing in my house

218
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,820
at this time of night?

219
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,140
The business we conduct keeps me tight.

220
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,950
I need this time to relax,

221
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,080
so I can prepare for
whatever wretchedness,

222
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,649
the next business day beholds.

223
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,150
- Well, Soleraa, you're getting your dose

224
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,630
of wretchedness tonight.

225
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,980
- What is it?

226
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,630
- One of the boxes got hit today.

227
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,250
One of the special ones.

228
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,437
- Which box, Polo?

229
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,497
- The one in Michigan.

230
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:46,970
- And what was the particular
contents of this box, Polo?

231
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,810
- 300 cash, about 100 in gold coin,

232
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,373
a couple of hard drives and-

233
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,393
- Spit it out.

234
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:59,144
- It was close to a $1,000,000
of diamonds in that box,

235
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,720
that's not the worst of it.

236
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,600
On those hard drives,

237
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,860
we keep a copy of all the
main trafficking routes,

238
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,830
stash houses, and the
names and badge numbers

239
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,890
of all the dirty cops on our payroll.

240
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,200
- $1.4 million gone.
- [Polo] That's it.

241
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,573
- Our chain of distribution compromised.

242
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,530
- There's a possibility
things can be slowed down

243
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,090
for a minute.

244
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,150
- Polo, get back those hard drives.

245
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,003
Get my money, find my diamonds,

246
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,940
and then I want you to kill
whoever the fuck stole them.

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,073
- I'm on it.

248
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,370
I've already alerted anybody

249
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,370
that can make a play for those diamonds.

250
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,870
It's gonna be hard to move them.

251
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,331
Hopefully, they don't figure out

252
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,440
what's on those hard drives.

253
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,950
We can get them back in our
possession as soon as possible.

254
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,181
- Hopefully, for them

255
00:10:58,181 --> 00:10:59,181
and for you.

256
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,413
- Jefa, one last thing,

257
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,903
your father's gold Desert
Eagle was in that box also.

258
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,400
- My father's gold pistol?

259
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:20,024
(birds chirping)

260
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,930
- Soleraa, let me show you

261
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,130
how we deal with
cockroaches in this family.

262
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,043
- Boss, it wasn't me,

263
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:33,428
I swear, boss,

264
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:34,528
it wasn't me, I swear.

265
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,760
- How dare you steal from
the hand that feeds you?

266
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,860
- Boss, boss, it wasn't me, it wasn't me.

267
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,820
- The hand that feeds your fat ass wife,

268
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,020
your three dumb kids, how dare you?

269
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,550
- Boss, boss, boss.

270
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,810
I swear, boss, it wasn't me.

271
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,650
Boss, I swear, I swear it wasn't me.

272
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,780
(gun fires)

273
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,223
- Soleraa, listen to me,

274
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,730
never steal, never cheat,
but never ever lie.

275
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,101
You understand this, baby?

276
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:02,768
- Yes father.
- Okay.

277
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,773
(gun firing)

278
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,173
Give me that.

279
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,470
Why did you do this?

280
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,838
- Because you stomp the cockroach,

281
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,671
not step on it father.

282
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,340
- Let's go get ice cream.

283
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,193
- Get back my gun.

284
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,981
(footsteps thudding)

285
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:34,570
(car engine roars)

286
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,650
- All right, so we should
be back in four days.

287
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,230
- Well, I already got us
hotel rooms booked in Atlanta.

288
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,210
We'll spend a couple of nights there,

289
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,660
and then we'll drive the rest of the way.

290
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,833
It'll only be about 11 or 12-hour drive.

291
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,191
- I got a home girl I
used to go to school with

292
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,571
that live in ATL.

293
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,493
I'ma try to link up with her.
- Cool.

294
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,830
- I had a long night, y'all.

295
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,780
I'ma get all my rest on this road trip.

296
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,429
- All right, well we ready to go.

297
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,232
So did you end up near some D last night?

298
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,815
(all laughing)

299
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,188
- [Crystal] I did.

300
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,840
(gentle music)

301
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,033
- Damn.

302
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,190
Hey, y'all see this video?

303
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,770
I saw it on the Crimes In Detroit IG page.

304
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,670
Check the security officer get smoked.

305
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,653
- Shit!

306
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,683
Jesus!

307
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,540
- Should have just scanned the room,

308
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,213
or just sliced the pie.

309
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,080
He would've caught the shooter
coming right up from behind.

310
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,913
- Right.

311
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,490
- That's the difference
between being a rented cop

312
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,573
and a real cop, I guess, training.

313
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,710
What'd you think, Lewis?

314
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,363
- Well, how about training and arrogance?

315
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,770
What do you think?

316
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,780
- I don't know about arrogance,

317
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,343
but for sure training.

318
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,790
Take a look at it.

319
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,203
- Let me see.

320
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,723
Hey, Herd.
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,300
- You remember about a year ago,

322
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,530
we got a call to investigate
the drive-by shooting

323
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,350
of the four girls.

324
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,750
The girls driving a Bentley.

325
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,840
- Of course, how could I forget?

326
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,187
They were pretty.

327
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:26,910
(Herd chuckles)

328
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,567
Let's see, we did our interviews,

329
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:32,800
and we wrote it up as an
extreme case of road rage.

330
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,964
Why are you bringing that up?

331
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,853
- Look, it's four women robbing this bank,

332
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,270
and they're wearing the same outfits,

333
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,420
the four girls were wearing

334
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,770
whose car got shot up that night.

335
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,670
- Let me see that.

336
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,090
Lewis, this is in Detroit not Miami,

337
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,739
besides my niece got
that same black outfit.

338
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:58,183
Don't you think you're
reaching a bit, Lewis?

339
00:15:58,183 --> 00:15:59,713
- I'm not so sure.

340
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,772
I'm not so sure.

341
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:09,259
(gentle music)

342
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,890
- I'm about to go slide
by Kitty house and kick it

343
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,895
with her for a minute.

344
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:15,728
Do you wanna ride with me?

345
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:17,210
- Nah, go ahead, baby.

346
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,120
Y'all got some catching up to do anyway.

347
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,200
Go ahead and do your thing.

348
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,400
And besides, I'm about to enjoy this bed

349
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,790
and call my baby, and let
him know we made it safe.

350
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,190
- All right, I'ma ask
Crystal or Daisy to see.

351
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,754
Tell Damon I said, "Hey."
- [Nola] I will.

352
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,870
- All right, girl.
- Bye.

353
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,113
Don't be too bad.

354
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:41,305
(door thuds)

355
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,953
Hi, baby.
- Hey, babe, what's going on?

356
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,340
- I just wanted to call you,

357
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,810
and let you know we made it slow and safe.

358
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,857
I miss you, and I love you.

359
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:55,000
- Aw.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,150
I'm missing and loving you too.

361
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,040
So, I'm glad y'all made it
to the A safe and sound,

362
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,770
but tell me about Detroit.

363
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,760
I been hearing some
crazy stuff, how is it?

364
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,300
- Yeah, it was nice.

365
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,981
We went Downtown,

366
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,320
and they actually have
their own little islands.

367
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,120
You gotta take the bridge to get to it,

368
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,150
and there's this real pretty
place called Belle Isle.

369
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,750
You remember the movie "8 Mile?"

370
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,897
Forget "8 Mile," "7 Mile" is
where the real hustle was at,

371
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,080
and they got their own little say

372
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,090
on how they greet each other too.

373
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,953
- Oh yeah, what's that?

374
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,710
- What up doe?

375
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,295
- What up doe?

376
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,350
(Damon chuckles)

377
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,379
Okay, that's way different.

378
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:34,370
I never heard that before, okay?

379
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,310
But, so what's going on with,

380
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,143
did Dee get to take care of

381
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,330
that business y'all went up there for?

382
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,660
- Yeah, yeah, she did.

383
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,160
They got some real nice homes there too.

384
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,873
Definitely, cheaper than Miami.

385
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,380
Yeah, we visited a mortgage
institution there too.

386
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,430
We made a withdrawal.

387
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,807
- Teller, put your hands in the air.

388
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,740
Everybody, now get on the ground.

389
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,510
- And met some real cool people there.

390
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,463
- All right, that's what's up.

391
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:02,580
Look babe, you know I'm
missing your face though.

392
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,350
You know, why don't you send
me a couple of pics real quick.

393
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,360
- No problem, baby.

394
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,670
All right, let me take a couple
pictures for you right now.

395
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,900
I'll send them to you and call you back.

396
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,630
- All right, cool.

397
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,066
All right.

398
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:20,649
(upbeat music)

399
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,060
(camera shutter clicking)

400
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,040
Mmm.

401
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,611
Okay.

402
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,194
(upbeat music)

403
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,819
(camera shutter clicking)

404
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,267
I like this one.

405
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,600
(upbeat music)

406
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,243
(camera shutter clicking)

407
00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,076
Damn.

408
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:04,186
Okay.

409
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:06,924
Damn, girl.

410
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,507
(upbeat music)

411
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,715
(Dee and Kitty laugh)

412
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:16,302
- Girl, how you been doing?

413
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,470
- I've been good, girl.

414
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,720
- It's been too long.
- [Dee] I know.

415
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,244
- So what you been up to.

416
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,830
- Since the divorce been finalized,

417
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,240
me and my homegirls, we
started us a business.

418
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,484
Then, you know, I bought
me some rental properties,

419
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,190
but other than that, dating
has been taking all my time.

420
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,900
- Okay sis, I see you.
(fingers snapping)

421
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,803
You always had that
entrepreneurial spirit.

422
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,900
I know having tenants cannot be easy,

423
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,990
but you cannot beat real
estate when it comes

424
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,793
to building that wealth.

425
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,820
So, what kind of business did you start?

426
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,020
- Oh girl, nothing important,

427
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,960
nothing that you really wanna hear about.

428
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,680
- Girl, I'm serious.

429
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,903
I'm proud of you.

430
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,600
Tell me.
- Okay, well,

431
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,920
me and my home girls, see,

432
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,130
we pilfer drug dealers
when they getting they cash

433
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,480
on their drug deals,

434
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,740
then we, you know, we
free them of any assets

435
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,270
that the known criminals have.

436
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,570
See, we get help from
an advisor that we have.

437
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,340
We set them up, we find them,

438
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,640
because they be having
these real envious partners,

439
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,473
you feel me?

440
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:13,373
So, girl.

441
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:19,739
(both laugh)
Girl, I got you.

442
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:21,940
- Girl, you always been crazy.

443
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,430
You had me going for a second though.

444
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,263
- I was serious.

445
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:29,176
- Huh?
- Got you again, girl.

446
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:30,817
(both laugh)

447
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,143
- Oh stop it, stop it.

448
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,700
How long you got to be in Atlanta for?

449
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,820
- For like the next two days,

450
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,180
and then we back on our road,

451
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,390
back to Miami, girl.

452
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,670
- Okay, well look,

453
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,990
if you and your girls wanna
hit up a party while you here,

454
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,340
there's one tomorrow night.

455
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,937
- Who party is this?

456
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:54,610
- That's King T's white party.

457
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,970
- Who is King T?

458
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,660
- Just a local rapper who was blowing up

459
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,580
on the underground hip hop scene.

460
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,910
He throws the livest parties in Georgia,

461
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,890
and his white parties are epic.

462
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,770
They're special invite only,

463
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,715
strictly for the movers
and shakers in the city.

464
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,270
- A rapper.

465
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,470
You know, if he do anything else?

466
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,780
- I mean, you ain't hear this from me,

467
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,350
but he has been known to get them things

468
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,027
in from out of town.

469
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:22,305
You know, them white things.

470
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:23,710
Why do you ask?

471
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,027
- 'Cause we gonna rob him,

472
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,829
(Dee laughs)
Got you again, girl.

473
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,192
(Kitty laughs)

474
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:32,740
- You are so much, girl.

475
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,884
You are too much,

476
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,890
(Kitty laughs)
I swear.

477
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,420
- You mind if I take a picture of this,

478
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,136
me and my home girls might slide through.

479
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:41,808
- Yeah, yeah.

480
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:44,884
(indistinct)

481
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:47,106
"We're gonna rob him," you're crazy.

482
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,439
- We're gonna rob him, girl.

483
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,330
See at first, I ain't know
what these random names

484
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,580
or addresses was on them flash drives,

485
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,610
but after I seen that invite,
it all popped in my head.

486
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,140
- What popped in your head, cuz?

487
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,870
- Look, let's look at this
Detroit file real quick.

488
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,510
When I open it, it's random names in it,

489
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,962
and it's about three different addresses.

490
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:07,912
- And?

491
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:11,020
- And, one of the addresses
is to the bank that we hit.

492
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,100
It got the safety deposit box
number on it and everything.

493
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,750
- So, what's these other
addresses and names

494
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,140
with the numbers next to them mean?

495
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,760
- See, I don't got all
that figured out yet,

496
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,940
but what I can see,

497
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,740
is look at the Atlanta folder.

498
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,890
It's another series of names,

499
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,650
and it's a couple of
addresses on here too.

500
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,910
- So?

501
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,250
- So, when I seen this invitation

502
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,720
that my home girl showed me,

503
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,610
the address to the party is
the address on the flash drive.

504
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,080
It got me to thinking.

505
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,160
- So you think it might
be another bag waiting

506
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,590
for us at this party?

507
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,330
- Exactly.

508
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,000
- Now, usually, we already
gotten intel on the operation

509
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,830
on how the licks move.

510
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,510
Don't y'all think we
move it a little too fast

511
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,933
on getting the bag without Benny's help?

512
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,640
- [Daisy] Man.
- Man, fuck Benny.

513
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,700
We the bag girls, we run this shit.

514
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,430
If he a dope dealer, then we on him.

515
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,707
- Right.

516
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,040
- We're only here for a couple more days,

517
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,250
we can go to the party,

518
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,430
have a ball and leave the next day.

519
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,410
But if the opportunity arises-

520
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,220
- We already got the heat
in the back of the jeep.

521
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,053
- Bingo.

522
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:12,792
(gentle music)

523
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,219
- Welcome ladies, invite please.

524
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:23,320
- Hi, I'm Kitty Black, personal
assistant to Mayor Jackson

525
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,670
and these are my plus ones.

526
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,538
- Four plus ones?

527
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:28,780
- [Kitty] Uh-huh.

528
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,410
- Man, chill with that.

529
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,310
Look at these fine ass women.

530
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,710
Come on in, enjoy the party.

531
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,090
- [Kitty] Thank you.

532
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,469
- [Man] Enjoy ladies.

533
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:40,052
(upbeat music)

534
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:06,489
(bottle pops)
(all cheering)

535
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:07,406
- Yes, yes.

536
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,593
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

537
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,920
Yeah, once again,

538
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,910
I am truly humbled to see
all you beautiful people

539
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,290

watching Italee for me.

809
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:27,170
You know she crying in the
middle of the night again.

810
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,200
- What?
- Yeah.

811
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Sometimes, she wakes up in
a cold sweat, screaming,

812
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,230
talking about somebody is about to die.

813
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,223
- Wow, that's weird.

814
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,033
- Sure is.

815
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:47,859
- This is for babysitting.
- Thank you,

816
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:51,820
but you know, I'm not just
babysitting my great grandbaby,

817
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,296
I'm helping you just
like I helped your mother

818
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,546
with you and your sister,

819
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:58,213
until she passed.

820
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,913
That's a lot of money.

821
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,440
Your sister ain't got you swinging

822
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,740
on no poles like she do when
y'all go out of town, does she?

823
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,020
- Nana, no.

824
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,630
I'm not swinging on any poles,

825
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,580
and neither is Nola.

826
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,307
I mean, not no more.

827
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:13,990
But when she was, it was okay.

828
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,010
She took care of herself

829
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,777
and she didn't need nobody for nothing.

830
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,070
- Mmm.

831
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,210
So where's all this money coming

832
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,050
from all of a sudden, huh?

833
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,050
Did y'all run an unemployment scam?

834
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,270
- No, we just help our friend with-

835
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,900
- Listen, I don't even wanna hear no lie.

836
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,740
Instead of buying this
baby all these toys,

837
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,780
and baby Fendi clothes and stuff,

838
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,990
you better make sure you have

839
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,300
at least four years worth
of college money stored up

840
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,150
for her somewhere.

841
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,890
'Cause if anything ever happen to you,

842
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,330
it'd be a real shame for me
to have to send her to college

843
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,300
on my social security checks.

844
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,980
- Nana, stop, stop.

845
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,461
Please, stop talking about death.

846
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:50,061
No one is about to die.

847
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,855
- I ain't the one talking about death,

848
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,272
that's your baby.

850
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,500

- I got you right here.

859
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,700

than it is on picture.

00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:36,058
How many of these we have again?

861
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:36,891

869
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,833

870
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:58,232

- Yeah, and I appreciate that,

894
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,070
but I ain't trying

895
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,663
to be a four or five brick
popping bitch anymore.

896
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,630
- So what the fuck is
you trying to say now?

897
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,790
- I got real money coming, listen.

898
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:18,240
(Herd sighs)

899
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,390
- You know what, Lewis?

900
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:25,020
One of the worst feelings
in the world is sitting

901
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,490
in the parking lot of a strip club,

902
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,700
watching all these fine
ass dancers go into work,

903
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,970
while we just sitting here in the car,

904
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,260
not going into the club,
getting lap dances.

905
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,593
- Control yourself, Herd.

906
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,080
- Lewis, I mean it.

907
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,280
I mean, remind why we're here again?

908
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,870
Because I ain't see
nothing about no strip club

909
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,820
on my docket today.

910
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,923
- I'm doing my own investigation
into a certain matter.

911
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,593
- Well, I would like to go
investigate those titties,

912
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:57,687
but let me guess, you're
talking about the four girls

913
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:02,687
and the drive-by/road rage
incident again, right?

914
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,550
Man, you gotta let that go.
- No.

915
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,260
Nope, I just can't.

916
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,070
- [Herd] Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

917
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,420
Their story just didn't
sit right with me then.

918
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,500
And then the video of the
bank robbery in Detroit,

919
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,140
man, it's just too much of
a coincidence if you ask me.

920
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,160
- [Herd] Well, nobody's asking you, Lewis.

921
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,483
- Shut up, Herd.
- [Herd] Just saying.

922
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,730
- Hey, come on, let's go talk to her.

923
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,160
Let's go inside, come on.

924
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,180
- All right, I wanna do
more than just talking.

925
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,180
(muffled rap music)

926
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,070
- Hey!
- What the fuck!

927
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,520
- Shut your face.
- What?

928
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,350
- Look, I'm Detective Lewis,

929
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,110
this my partner, Detective Herd.

930
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:50,943
- What's up?

931
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,070
- We just got a few questions to ask you

932
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,110
about the robbery and
shooting you were involved in

933
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,070
about a year ago.

934
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,872
- Oh my God, this shit again?

935
00:41:57,872 --> 00:41:58,705
- It's just a few questions,

936
00:41:58,705 --> 00:42:00,850
but you're Charlotte Williams, correct?

937
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,683
- Yeah.

938
00:42:01,683 --> 00:42:04,780
- You were assaulted during
the robbery, correct?

939
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,850
- Yeah, I was assaulted,

940
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,930
but obviously, I'm in
the middle of something,

941
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,756
so is this gonna take a long time or-

942
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:11,040
- Look, I'm almost done.

943
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
When you gave your statement,

944
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,400
you couldn't give a description then,

945
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,360
but if I showed you a
picture of the suspects,

946
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,110
you think maybe it could drag
your memory a little bit?

947
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,463
- Maybe.

948
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,453
- Take a look.

949
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:31,145
- Yeah, that's them.

950
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,570
- Wait, wait a minute.

951
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,360
Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

952
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,920
They was here that night.

953
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,860
I was cleaning up, Sharbliss
was dancing for Jimmy.

954
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,160
- Jimmy Wilson, he was one of the guys,

955
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,660
doing security that night.

956
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,600
He was assaulted too?
- Yeah, he was assaulted.

957
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,230
They fucked Jimmy up.

958
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,380
They split his head
open to the white meat.

959
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,390
- Continue, please.

960
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,517
- Like I said, I was cleaning up,

961
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,503
Sharbliss was dancing for Jimmy,

962
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,040
I looked away for two seconds maybe.

963
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,710
I look back, I get punched in the face.

964
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,970
I'm knocked clean the fuck out.

965
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,250
I wake up tied up, behind
the bar with Jimmy,

966
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,230
and the other bouncer that
was working here that night.

967
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,593
That's really all I remember.

968
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,420
- So, you don't know who shot

969
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,623
and robbed the bar owner, Vincent Gravy?

970
00:43:21,009 --> 00:43:25,262
- No, but I do remember
the bitch that hit me.

971
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,030
She had some long, pretty nails.

972
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,863
You know what I'm saying?

973
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:28,696
Like a stripper.

974
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
Y'all gonna pay me some money for this?

975
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,147
(Herd laughs)

976
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:36,644
- Ain't nobody paying
you for this information,

977
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:41,561
but we could do a little
something special in the VIP room,

978
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:45,419
if you know what I mean.

979
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:47,469
- Is there anything else you can tell us?

980
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,283
- Yeah, fuck the police!

981
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,620
- Oh, you mean like right now?

982
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,113
- Nice job, you fucking pervert.

983
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,060
- Right now, right now?
- Let's go, Herd!

984
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,063
- Hmmm.

985
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:14,909
Rare.

986
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,321
Very rare.

987
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,310
- It's solid gold,

988
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,530
I know they were worth something.

989
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,343
- Whoa, most definitely
worth something, my friend.

990
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,700
I understand you have some diamonds too?

991
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,453
- That I do.

992
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,333
- Let me take a look.

993
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,983
How many of these did you say you have?

994
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,460
- 20 of them.

995
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,440
- Mazeltov, my friend?

996
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,697
- How'd it go?
- It went real well.

997
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:05,170
- I knew it, daddy.

998
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,003
I knew it.

999
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,370
- Hey, hold on to this
till we make the exchange.

1000
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,083
It'll make you feel
better in the mean time.

1001
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:22,680
(upbeat music)

1002
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,960
- So ladies, Benny met with the jeweler,

1003
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,510
about the coins and the diamonds,

1004
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:30,302
and he's willing to pay 700,000 for them.

1005
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:31,650
- Damn, you for real?

1006
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,380
- For real, for real, big facts.

1007
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,780
- Damn, that's what I'm talking about.

1008
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,540
- So with the 300,000 in cash,

1009
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,760
and the 700,000 in gold and diamonds,

1010
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,283
we hit for a milli in Detroit.

1011
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,973
- Hell, yeah.

1012
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:46,950
But you know what, Benny
still has to get his 20%.

1013
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,820
So that leaves us with
the $800,000 breakdown.

1014
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,600
- Yeah, but them clowns we hit in Atlanta,

1015
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,550
we got them for like
800,000, that's all ours.

1016
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,550
We don't give Benny shit.

1017
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,343
- So that's 400,000 a
piece y'all on one trip.

1018
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:01,930
- [All] Damn.

1019
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:04,180
- So when we getting the
money for the diamonds?

1020
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,013
- Slow down.

1021
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,120
Next week, Benny gotta
set up with a meeting,

1022
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,910
Downtown for the exchange.

1023
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,760
- Cool, they got a restaurant
run down there that I like.

1024
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,650
I'ma roll with y'all to the meeting.

1025
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,760
- [Daisy] Sounds like a plan.

1026
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,080
- Well, we dropping all this good news.

1027
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,460
I got something I gotta tell you all.

1028
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,282
A bitch is getting married.

1029
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:25,204
(all chattering)

1030
00:46:25,204 --> 00:46:26,283
- Let me see.

1031
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,670
And I've gotta be your bridesmaid.

1032
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,180
Congrats, babe.
- Thanks, girl.

1033
00:46:32,218 --> 00:46:33,270
Give me a hug, girl.

1034
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,040
- Waiter, can we please get
that bottle of champagne?

1035
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,721
We got some celebrating
to do for our girl.

1036
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:39,721
- Yes.
- Yes.

1037
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:43,553
- Ooh.
- Yes.

1038
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:46,757
(indistinct)

1039
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:51,176
(cork pops)
(women cheer)

1040
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,759
(gentle music)

1041
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:06,991
- Hey, yo guard, you got a cigarette?

1042
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,549
- Aint shit popping.

1043
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:11,132
- Well, then fuck you, you pig.

1044
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:16,114
(dramatic music)

1045
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:22,418
(door clicking)

1046
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,240
Excuse me.
- Give me a second.

1047
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,930
- Okay, no rush, lady,

1048
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,080
I got nothing but time.

1049
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,153
- Ricardo Jones, aka, Rocko.

1050
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,590
Life long gang banger,

1051
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,750
until you graduated
into the narcotics game

1052
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,900
where you've sold, damn marijuana,

1053
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,053
heroin and everything in between.

1054
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,300
You just got convicted
of a double homicide.

1055
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,057
- Look, lady, I know who I am,

1056
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:06,150
and you know who I am.

1057
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,900
You could save this Wikipedia shit.

1058
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,500
Now, what I don't know is who you are,

1059
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,383
and why you here?

1060
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,400
- Well, Mr. Jones, I'm Detective Lewis,

1061
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,933
Miami Police Homicide Precinct 12.

1062
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,760
- Detective Lewis.

1063
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,813
Call me Rocko.

1064
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,770
You didn't work on my case,

1065
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,913
so why are you here?

1066
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,950
- Ricardo, in your statement,

1067
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,430
you said, "Three females
dressed in all black,

1068
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,503
wearing diamond masks
were the shooters of you,

1069
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:40,870
your two slain associates,

1070
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,360
and the other murdered victim
at the scene of the crime."

1071
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,360
But are you sure it
was three and not four?

1072
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,540
- I said, "Call me Rocko,"

1073
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,060
and I can count.

1074
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,960
I did graduate the eighth grade, lady.

1075
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,170
So like I said, in my statement,

1076
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,780
the three bursts through the back door

1077
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,540
of where me and my associates
were having Bible study at.

1078
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,503
- Yeah right, man, come on.

1079
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,943
- Right hand to God.

1080
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,623
- This should be a start
of a good relationship.

1081
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,431
- As long as this work is right,

1082
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:24,059
it's gonna be a beautiful relationship.

1083
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:25,630
- Rocko, as you say,

1084
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,260
the work speaks for itself.

1085
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,093
- We were just in the middle

1086
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,913
of discussing Luke verse 12, man.

1087
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,440
The lights clicked off, they burst in,

1088
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,423
and all I saw was bullets
flying all around me.

1089
00:49:37,423 --> 00:49:39,300
(gun fires)

1090
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,273
Whoa, this a set up?
- Look, calm the fuck down!

1091
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:43,858
- Its a set up up?
- Look, this ain't no nothing.

1092
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:44,890
- What the fuck Rocko?
- This ain't no mess,

1093
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,400
calm the fuck down!

1094
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,660
- Okay, and?

1095
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,720
- Well, that's where I got on my knees,

1096
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,003
and I started praying to Jesus,

1097
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,470
and that's when I got shot.

1098
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,303
I fell back,

1099
00:49:55,303 --> 00:49:58,660
and I couldn't feel my legs.
(guns firing)

1100
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,500
When the lights clicked back on,

1101
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,950
all I saw was the asses

1102
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,000
of three women running out the back door.

1103
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,223
- Don't touch my fucking money.

1104
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,983
- I got the money.

1105
00:50:08,983 --> 00:50:11,109
- What the fuck do you
have to do with that?

1106
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:12,470
- Then I am taking this bag along.

1107
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,375
- Fuck it, grab it, let's go.

1108
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,340
- And the money and the work was gone.

1109
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,250
- Cash and work as you call
it at a Bible study class?

1110
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,249
Come on, man.

1111
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,082
(Rocko laughs)

1112
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:21,970
- No, no, I mean,

1113
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,120
it was tithes and Bibles.

1114
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,040
- Right.

1115
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,060
- Look, bottom line is the
pig stuck me with the murders.

1116
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,996
And all I was doing was
trying to defend myself,

1117
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:33,296
that ain't that some shit.

1118
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,903
- That is some shit.

1119
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:42,790
Look, do you happen to know
who those three girls are?

1120
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:47,040
(Rocko laughs)

1121
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,773
- So the pigs want me to do
their job for them now, huh?

1122
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,833
Okay, you know, I didn't
know who they were back then,

1123
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,103
but I know exactly who they are now.

1124
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,293
Word on the street is the bag girls.

1125
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,493
- The bad girls.

1126
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,473
- Not the bad girls, the bag girls.

1127
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:10,670
- The bag girls?

1128
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,880
Yo, where can I find them.

1129
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,563
- No, now, that's gonna cost you.

1130
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:20,800
- Okay.

1131
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,263
Look, I can talk to your judge.

1132
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,970
You know, tell them you're a
cooperating witness on a case

1133
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,083
that I'm working on.

1134
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,440
Get a few years shaved off your sentence,

1135
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,640
and until then, I can fill your cell

1136
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,423
with plenty of commissary.

1137
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:41,990
(Rocko laughing)

1138
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,513
- Yo, guard, you hear this
this shit, commissary?

1139
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,180
You think I give a fuck

1140
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,230
about a few years shaved off my sentence?

1141
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,250
I'm doing 25 to life, that ain't nothing.

1142
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,310
Oh, you really thought
you was gonna swam you

1143
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,550
with some ramen noodles or some chips?

1144
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,383
Hell, no.

1145
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,583
- So what would you like, Rocko?

1146
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,890
- Now, you're talking.

1147
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:13,820
So look, I'ma be in this hell
whole for the rest of my life,

1148
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,320
paralyzed from the waist down.

1149
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:20,073
You know, I can barely jack my time away,

1150
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,083
but my mind still works
and my memory is real good.

1151
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,260
So what I would like as a
lifetime memory of your titties.

1152
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,763
- Excuse me!
- You heard me.

1153
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,700
So pull those big, pretty
yellow motherfuckers out,

1154
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,360
and I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

1155
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,913
- That shit ain't gonna happen!

1156
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,773
- Guard, take me back to my cell.

1157
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,763
- Wait, wait, wait.

1158
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,070
You better have some good information.

1159
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,687
(bright upbeat music)

1160
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,956
(car honks)

1161
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,310
(camera shutter clicking)

1162
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,210
- So that money I was talking about,

1163
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,513
it's coming in next week.

1164
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:42,089
- And I'ma reach out to my plug,

1165
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:45,120
and I'ma have them double up
that shipment on next week.

1166
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,650
- For the better price.
- [Antwon] For sure.

1167
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,301
Welcome to the big leagues, my baby.

1168
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:50,134
(camera shutter clicking)

1169
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:51,950
- Thank you for putting me on, Antwon.

1170
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:55,547
- If you go with that funny shit again,

1171
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:57,774
look, ain't shit gonna be funny,

1172
00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:00,312
well, the motherfuckers gonna
come knocking at your door.

1173
00:54:00,312 --> 00:54:01,690
You ain't fucking with petty drudge,

1174
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,420
you move a real weight man.
(camera shutter clicking)

1175
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,223
- I ain't worry about the police,

1176
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:07,903
I only worry about the Feds.

1177
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,953
- Who the you fuck do you
think I'm talking about?

1178
00:54:21,162 --> 00:54:23,176
(car door thuds)

1179
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,814
(car engine roars)
(camera shutter clicking)

1180
00:54:26,814 --> 00:54:29,564
(dramatic music)

1181
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,970
(coin clinks)

1182
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,023
- Who was that Black motherfucker

1183
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:44,873
that my cousin saw you up with today?

1184
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,715
Huh, who is he?

1185
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:51,548
Who is he?

1186
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:56,027
(fist thuds)

1187
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:59,053
- What are you doing?
- Who is he?

1188
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:00,197
- What are you doing?

1189
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:01,161
What are you doing?

1190
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:02,244
Please, stop.

1191
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,037
- Sofia, what the hell is this, huh?

1192
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:15,267
(coin clinks)

1193
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:16,600
What did you do?

1194
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:18,388
(fist thuds)

1195
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:20,204
What did you do?

1196
00:55:20,204 --> 00:55:22,621
(fist thuds)

1197
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:49,917
- Jefa, this is the one.

1198
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,283
Her name is Sofia.

1199
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,793
She was Samuel's girlfriend.

1200
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,821
- Did she give you all
the information we needed?

1201
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,071
- We got what we could get.

1202
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:06,811
(speaks in foreign language)

1203
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:18,155
- [Sofia] I ain't do it.

1204
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,310
- Don't worry, don't
worry, little cockroach.

1205
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,132
Go to sleep.

1206
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,799
(Sofia choking)

1207
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:32,931
Don't worry, don't worry,

1208
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,693
go to sleep, go to sleep.

1209
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:38,512
(Sofia choking)

1210
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,100
Now, go deal with the rest of them.

1211
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,330
- Okay, boss.

1212
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,800
We're on it.

1213
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,633
- Samuel.

1214
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:01,940
(gun fires)

1215
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,920
- Soleraa.
- Yeah, he was weak,

1216
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,593
and he didn't know how
to pick his bitches.

1217
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:10,284
(gentle music)

1218
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,790
- So you and Kenny set that date yet?

1219
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,114
- Girl, no, I'm still trying to figure out

1220
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:17,260
if we gonna do a destination wedding

1221
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,240
or if we're gonna do it here.

1222
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,100
- A destination wedding.
- [Dee] Yes.

1223
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,030
- That sounds nice.

1224
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,997
I could see you in a pretty
white dress in the sand,

1225
00:57:26,997 --> 00:57:30,390
out in the ocean in Costa Rica, Tulum,

1226
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,284
and even maybe a Dubai backdrop.

1227
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:33,410
(Nola laughs)

1228
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,130
- Yeah, that sounds fascinating.

1229
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,040
You know, you're my maid
of honor though, right?

1230
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,250
- Of course, if not me who else?

1231
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,560
Daisy's crazy ass.

1232
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,400
- Shit, your little sister, Crystal,

1233
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,943
running right behind Daisy.

1234
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,280
- [Nola] Tell me about that.

1235
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,020
- Look, I'm starting to
think they both trying

1236
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,720
to be the Black female John Wicks.

1237
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,350
- What's up with this shit?

1238
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,300
Why she keep staring at us like this?

1239
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,533
- I don't know, but she looks familiar.

1240
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,860
- Nah, she don't look familiar,

1241
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,860
but if she keeps staring at us
like that, I'ma beat her ass.

1242
00:58:10,447 --> 00:58:11,883
- Oh shit, here she comes.

1243
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:13,821
The bitch tall too.

1244
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:16,265
You got your burn on you.
- Hell yeah, how about you?

1245
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:18,015
- [Dee] So, you know.

1246
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:23,103
- How can we help you?

1247
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,383
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1248
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,930
I didn't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable,

1249
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,770
but it's just that, I mean, you two,

1250
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,470
you look so familiar.

1251
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,750
- Well, we don't know you,
and you need to back up

1252
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,240
'cause you're getting a little too close.

1253
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,073
- My bad, whoa.

1254
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,953
Now those, those are some nice nails.

1255
00:58:47,512 --> 00:58:51,530
That's it, that's where I know you from.

1256
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,830
You're dancer at Truth, right?

1257
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,803
That strip bar.

1258
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,860
- No, sweetie.

1259
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,490
I don't dance anymore.

1260
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,740
I used to dance at Truth,

1261
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,563
but I don't even recall
ever seeing you there.

1262
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:07,400
I know you see me.
- Yeah, probably.

1263
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,142
You know my partner, he
liked to hang out at those-

1264
00:59:10,142 --> 00:59:13,550
- I don't know, your partner?
- Yeah, partner.

1265
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,600
Oh my bad, I didn't tell you?

1266
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,200
Oh, I'm a detective.

1267
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,042
Yeah, Detective Lewis,
Miami Homicide Precinct 12.

1268
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:22,930
- We don't see your partner,

1269
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,870
So that mean, this is not
official police, baby.

1270
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,450
- It's not official, but
it is police business.

1271
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,597
- And what's that supposed to mean?

1272
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:32,720
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
take it easy, beautiful.

1273
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,863
It may be something,

1274
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,780
maybe it's not.

1275
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,250
You two, enjoy your peddies.

1276
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:46,625
- What the fuck!

1277
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,772
- [Jeweler] Hey, how did you get in here?

1278
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:02,270
(speaks in foreign language)

1279
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,250
- I came to you with respect.

1280
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,790
I asked you if you know anybody trying

1281
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,130
to sell a large number of diamonds,

1282
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,840
did I not do that?
- You did.

1283
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,710
- But here you are, loading
up a suitcase full of cash

1284
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,133
to buy diamonds, am I right?

1285
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,870
- You're correct.

1286
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,941
- Who're you buying those
fucking diamonds from?

1287
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:22,723
(speaks in foreign language)

1288
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:23,623
- His name is Ben.

1289
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,790
I have all his information in my phone.

1290
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,030
- Good.

1291
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,520
Now, how do you think Soleraa would feel

1292
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,620
if she know about this fucking disrespect?

1293
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,260
- The exchange is happening
is the Stonecrest Hotel,

1294
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,703
this Friday at noon.

1295
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:52,037
I give this money to you to
buy my life back from Soleraa.

1296
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:54,720
(Polo laughs)

1297
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,650
That's not enough.

1298
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,410
- Hey, hey, don't do this.

1299
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,534
We can work it out.

1300
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:00,473
(speaks in foreign language)

1301
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:02,806
(gun fires)

1302
01:01:09,758 --> 01:01:12,508
(fists thudding)

1303
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:25,976
(dramatic music)

1304
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:37,469
- Hey, remember me?

1305
01:01:39,546 --> 01:01:42,198
- Yeah, I remember you.

1306
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,115
- I knew you would.

1307
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,343
It looks like your shoulder
healed up pretty good.

1308
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,703
You know, I don't see no scar or nothing.

1309
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,500
- It was just the graze,

1310
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,833
plus the melanin in my
skin helps me heal better.

1311
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,302
You wouldn't know anything
about that though, would you?

1312
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,885
(Lewis laughs)

1313
01:02:06,202 --> 01:02:09,203
- That's a good one, that's a good one.

1314
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:12,063
But you know what my light-skin
ass do know stuff about?

1315
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,573
Robberies.

1316
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,750
Now, that got your attention, didn't it?

1317
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:22,723
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1318
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,793
- It's a nice workout bag.

1319
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,370
I bet you and your girls
get a lot of money in there.

1320
01:02:38,642 --> 01:02:43,642
(fists thudding)
(dramatic music)

1321
01:02:44,425 --> 01:02:46,187
Get the fuck off!

1322
01:02:46,187 --> 01:02:47,343
Do it, come on.

1323
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:51,283
You better get the fuck off of me.

1324
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,703
I should take your ass here right now.

1325
01:02:55,693 --> 01:02:56,526
- For what?

1326
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:59,360
If you had something on us,
we'd be in jail already.

1327
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,650
- You're right.

1328
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:04,360
But when I do, I'm coming all
three of y'all, or is it four?

1329
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,000
You know, I ain't figured it out yet.

1330
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,240
- Yeah, well when you do,

1331
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,400
you know where to find me.

1332
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,763
- That I do, that I do.

1333
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,263
- We got to meet up now.

1334
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,100
So, I'm at the gym,

1335
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,740
and the police officer from
that situation last year,

1336
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,450
you know, the one that took my statement,

1337
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,060
that bitch show up.

1338
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,020
- So that's who that bitch was.

1339
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,410
Tall, light-skinned chick.
- Yeah.

1340
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:46,180
- Oh, shit.

1341
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,140
- Yeah, she started talking shit,

1342
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,530
talking about robberies,

1343
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,920
saying a bag girl's
name, all slick and shit.

1344
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,480
- Wait, what else happened?

1345
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,260
She kept talking, so I punched on her.

1346
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,488
- Hell, yeah.

1347
01:03:57,488 --> 01:03:58,321
(Daisy laughs)

1348
01:03:58,321 --> 01:03:59,650
- Yeah, the bitch hit me back though,

1349
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,010
but that shit ain't hurt.

1350
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,497
I was about to jump on her again,

1351
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:04,750
and she pulled a pistol out on me.

1352
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,670
- Damn, cuz, you good.
- Oh, you know I'm good.

1353
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,450
- But what else she say?

1354
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,630
- She say she gonna try to
find out more information,

1355
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,460
but she don't know if
it's three or four of us.

1356
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,900
- Damn.

1357
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,760
- She popped up on me
and Nola the other day

1358
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,390
at the nail salon.

1359
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,500
Man, that mean, she's most
definitely watching us.

1360
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,650
- And dropping hints
about Vinny's ass too.

1361
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,650
- Okay, wait, see, this is too much.

1362
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,940
We're gonna have to lay low for awhile.

1363
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,010
- Girls, the heat is definitely on us.

1364
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,880
After we get the money for these diamonds,

1365
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,640
we need to retire these masks.

1366
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,350
- Yeah, 'cause I'm about to get married.

1367
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,500
I can't be somebody's wife

1368
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,770
and a whole stick-up
artist at the same time.

1369
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,180
- Well, I got work in the streets,

1370
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,750
and I'm about to have more, so, I'm good.

1371
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,540
- I have Italee to think about.

1372
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,660
- Look y'all, we had a good ride,

1373
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,623
but man, I'm done.

1374
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,993
- And if you done, I'm done.

1375
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:02,523
- My mask is in the house,
I'm about to go get it.

1376
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,317
- Damn, that's how we going out?

1377
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,783
I guess, I'ma get mine too then, shit.

1378
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:22,283
- And just like that?
- [Nola] It's over.

1379
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,210
- Daisy, look, we got
the exchange in two days.

1380
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,583
Just be ready.
- [Daisy] I stay ready.

1381
01:05:30,531 --> 01:05:33,114
(gentle music)

1382
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,720
- What's wrong, babe?

1383
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,770
You've been quiet all night.

1384
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,153
- I just got a lot on my mind,

1385
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:45,163
just going through some things.

1386
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,180
- I know planning a
wedding could be rough,

1387
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,590
we'll just get a wedding planner,

1388
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,430
got to relieve you from
some of that worry you got.

1389
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,530
- I wish that was all I was worried about.

1390
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,080
- I mean, well, that's what I'm here for.

1391
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,190
You just got to let me
solve all your problems,

1392
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,609
or I can get you through them.

1393
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:05,660
Tell me what's really bothering you.

1394
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,740
- I just feel like I'm
under a lot of pressure.

1395
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,084
I feel like I got the world on my back.

1396
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:13,020
- [Kenny] Okay.

1397
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,143
- And I feel like, maybe, I
need to escape for a minute,

1398
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:19,323
maybe relocate.
- Relocate.

1399
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,983
- [Dee] Yeah, permanently.

1400
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,703
- And leave Miami, the 305?

1401
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:28,350
It's one of the most
beautiful cities in America.

1402
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,773
- Well, maybe, it's time to leave America.

1403
01:06:30,773 --> 01:06:33,690
(knocking on door)

1404
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,630
- Where is Italee?

1405
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,380
Nana is here to watch you again.

1406
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,450
- She's upstairs asleep,

1407
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,540
but I wanted to talk to you

1408
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,430
about something first.
- Okay, baby.

1409
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,741
Everything all right?

1410
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,347
What do you wanna talk about?

1411
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:55,430
- Things could be better.

1412
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,610
- Is your sister all right?

1413
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,130
How's Nola?

1414
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:02,970
- She's fine, but you know
what you said the other day,

1415
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,863
about that college thing.
- Okay.

1416
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:15,743
Oh my.

1417
01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:21,696
(dramatic music)

1418
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,413
- [Polo] Jefa, we know who they all are.

1419
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:31,403
- That's good, Polo.

1420
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:34,573
- When the sun rises, they
will all wake up to hell.

1421
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,532
- [Dee] What'd you want me
to cook you for breakfast?

1422
01:07:45,532 --> 01:07:46,365
- I already order, babe.

1423
01:07:46,365 --> 01:07:47,710
You don't have to cook.

1424
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:48,710
- Oh, that's cool.

1425
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,170
Okay, well, I'm just about to go upstairs

1426
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,996
to take a quick shower there?
- Okay.

1427
01:07:51,996 --> 01:07:53,328
- All right.

1428
01:07:53,328 --> 01:07:56,078
(dramatic music)

1429
01:08:23,744 --> 01:08:25,077
- Hey, I'm here.

1430
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:27,726
- Okay, good.

1431
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,215
Oh boy, here with the money.

1432
01:08:30,215 --> 01:08:31,723
We're just waiting on you with the jewels?

1433
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,060
Room 211.
- Cool.

1434
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:39,828
It's unlocked?

1435
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:42,132
All right, I'll be right there.

1436
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:42,965
- Bet.

1437
01:08:47,733 --> 01:08:50,483
(dramatic music)

1438
01:08:51,806 --> 01:08:54,723
(doorbell ringing)

1439
01:09:01,286 --> 01:09:02,396
(water running)

1440
01:09:02,396 --> 01:09:04,729
(gun fires)

1441
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:10,492
- Oh my God, Kenny.

1442
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,396
- Who is it?

1443
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:33,788
Who is it?
- Special delivery.

1444
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,133
- Everything looks cool.

1445
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,870
- So listen, the exchange
only take about 10 minutes.

1446
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:47,519
If I'm not out in 10 minutes, come get me.

1447
01:09:47,519 --> 01:09:48,519
- I got you.

1448
01:09:49,475 --> 01:09:52,225
(car door thuds)

1449
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:56,021
(dramatic music)

1450
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,143
- Benny, I got that bag.

1451
01:10:25,935 --> 01:10:28,352
(fist thuds)

1452
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,105
(dramatic music)

1453
01:10:58,532 --> 01:11:01,468
(guns firing)

1454
01:11:01,468 --> 01:11:04,218
(dramatic music)

1455
01:11:15,663 --> 01:11:18,006
(gun fires)

1456
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:20,756
(dramatic music)

1457
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:33,092
- Where you going, old lady?

1458
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,148
- Now, where are you going?

1459
01:11:40,148 --> 01:11:43,219
(gun firing)

1460
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:44,627
(gun clicking)

1461
01:11:44,627 --> 01:11:47,586
(gun firing)

1462
01:11:47,586 --> 01:11:50,336
(dramatic music)

1463
01:12:21,934 --> 01:12:24,434
(guns firing)

1464
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,853
- Baby, I'm so sorry.

1465
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:49,118
- Nana, Nana!

1466
01:12:51,897 --> 01:12:53,564
Nana, what happened?

1467
01:12:54,535 --> 01:12:56,202
Nana, what happened?

1468
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,213
- I guess Italee was right.

1469
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:08,339
- Italee, Italee!

1470
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:14,330
Italee.

1471
01:13:16,743 --> 01:13:18,243
Come here.
- I'm Okay.

1472
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:26,809
(dramatic music)

1473
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,490
- Oh damn, Bae, come here.

1474
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,313
- Word.
- Where are you going?

1475
01:13:34,313 --> 01:13:35,360
- All rubbing on me and shit?

1476
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,160
Oh this motherfucker grow, you now.

1477
01:13:43,703 --> 01:13:44,870
- Nola, my baby.

1478
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:50,244
- What happened?

1479
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,620
- I'm sorry, my baby.

1480
01:13:55,467 --> 01:13:56,383
- But why, what?

1481
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:03,087
- They had my mother.

1482
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:06,587
(Benny coughs)

1483
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:08,763
- That's fucked up.

1484
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:12,724
- And I had no choice.

1485
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,743
- Oh, you had a choice.

1486
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:41,389
- That was gangster.

1487
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:43,540
- Fuck you!

1488
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,303
- No, fuck you.

1489
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,763
Tie this puta to the bed.

1490
01:14:50,706 --> 01:14:51,539
- So what?

1491
01:14:51,539 --> 01:14:52,380
- [Daisy] You're free for the night?

1492
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,140
- Hey, I'm with it.

1493
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,163
You with it?

1494
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,970
- You girls stole from the wrong one.

1495
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,843
It was up to me, you'd be dead by now.

1496
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,243
But my boss, the queen,

1497
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,603
wants you and all your amigos to suffer.

1498
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,553
- Who's your boss?
- Soleraa.

1499
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:17,770
Heir to the most notorious
Colombian gangster ever,

1500
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:22,383
Miguel Castillo.
- Sorry, I never heard of her.

1501
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,333
- Make her suffer.

1502
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,033
- [Daisy] Move nigga.
- Oh shit.

1503
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:43,569
(car door thuds)

1504
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:18,464
- Yeah, my boss wanted
me to make you suffer.

1505
01:16:18,464 --> 01:16:19,533
So, I'm gonna make you bleed first,

1506
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,880
like I did your little friend over here.

1507
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,939
- Fuck you!

1508
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:25,558
(leg thuds)

1509
01:16:25,558 --> 01:16:28,206
(gun fires)

1510
01:16:28,206 --> 01:16:30,956
- What the fuck going on in here?

1511
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,373
Come on, Nola.

1512
01:16:35,302 --> 01:16:37,567
- [Nola] And what the fuck
you think you're going?

1513
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:46,883
- There's nothing more
that I can do, sorry.

1514
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,680
- I haven't heard back from
Nola and Daisy, but I got you.

1515
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,660
- Hey, no hiccups on this one.

1516
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,790
We need solid evidence.

1517
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,310
Make sure you get all the blood samples

1518
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,990
from the walls up there.

1519
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,760
Thank you, thank you.

1520
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:19,823
So, from the writing on the wall upstairs,

1521
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,020
I take it you're my fourth bag girl.

1522
01:17:25,327 --> 01:17:27,227
- I don't know what you talking about.

1523
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,960
- How many more people have
to die before y'all stop doing

1524
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,920
what you're doing?
- Doing what?

1525
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,670
This was a home invasion going bad.

1526
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:38,183
We don't know what you're talking about.

1527
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,579
- Yall just don't get it.

1528
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:43,690
You don't get it.

1529
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:45,080
Even when the writing's on the wall,

1530
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,467
and in your case in blood.

1531
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:47,980
- Bitch, I'll slap the fuck out of you.

1532
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,150
That's my home girl
grandma you talking about.

1533
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,093
- Try me if you want to!
- Stop!

1534
01:17:52,946 --> 01:17:54,743
(phone chiming)

1535
01:17:54,743 --> 01:17:56,770
- This is Nola, we got to go.

1536
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:59,394
- You're lucky she just saved your ass.

1537
01:17:59,394 --> 01:18:01,350
- I'm trying to save y'all asses.

1538
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,183
Look Ms. Taylor,

1539
01:18:02,183 --> 01:18:04,320
answer my calls regarding
this investigation.

1540
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,130
- I gotta get my baby girl.

1541
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,713
They killed Nana.

1542
01:18:16,587 --> 01:18:19,140
- What?

1543
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,560
- Where's Italee?
- She's fine,

1544
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,253
she's in the backseat
sleeping, she's fine.

1545
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:26,910
- [Nola] Nana.

1546
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:27,763
But Nana, no!

1547
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:31,100
- I heard they almost got you too, sis.

1548
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,180
Are you okay?

1549
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,340
- No, I'm not okay.

1550
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,740
They killed Nana and Benny.

1551
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,223
- And they took the diamonds.

1552
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,910
- And they almost killed
me too, but I got away.

1553
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,500
They killed Kenny, y'all.

1554
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,933
- All right, cuz, I'm so sorry.

1555
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:47,735
- Me too.

1556
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,090
- Y'all, we got to get out of Miami.

1557
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:54,770
Whoever is trying to
kill us, ain't no joke.

1558
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,970
We got to get far away as possible.

1559
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:00,100
- Look, we got to get all the
money that we got together,

1560
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,760
and we got to go, maybe
even out the country.

1561
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,530
- Man, I'm with it.
- Man, fuck that!

1562
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:08,290
They killed your fiance, your grandma,

1563
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,507
and took the diamonds,

1564
01:19:09,507 --> 01:19:12,090
and we can't just go
hiding like some bitches.

1565
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,700
- That's easy for you to say.

1566
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,800
Nobody you know got hurt or killed.

1567
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,337
- Man, you almost got killed, Dee.

1568
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:19,050
You're close to me.

1569
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,270
We are family.

1570
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,920
Shit, we all are.

1571
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,250
Somebody tried to hurt my family,

1572
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,454
nah, I got to get back at them.

1573
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:28,600
- And we don't even know who it is.

1574
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,870
Who trying to kill us?
- I know who it is.

1575
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,030
It's a Colombian drug dealer

1576
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:35,370
by the name of Soleraa Castillo.

1577
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,680
That's who safe deposit box we hit.

1578
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,120
- Well, how are we supposed to find her?

1579
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,579
Benny was the one with
the connections and stuff.

1580
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:42,810
- [Nola] I don't know.

1581
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:46,155
- Nah, I think I got the answer to that.

1582
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:47,322
Come on, y'all

1583
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,040
I knew you would come in handy, nigga.

1584
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,670
I know where we could take him.

1585
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,920
- So y'all handle him.

1586
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,770
I got something special for
us, I just got to go grab it.

1587
01:20:11,315 --> 01:20:13,898
(upbeat music)

1588
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:24,788
- A Twon.
- Daisy, nigga.

1589
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:30,140
- Hit the music so we can drown
this motherfucker's screams.

1590
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,450
Now, tell me, where can
we find Soleraa Castillo.

1591
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:42,150
- You shot my stomach,

1592
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,700
bleeding to fucking death, man.

1593
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,423
Fuck with y'all.

1594
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,926
- Wrong answer, nigga.

1595
01:20:49,926 --> 01:20:52,343
(fist thuds)

1596
01:20:55,588 --> 01:20:58,588
- Yo Daisy, let me get some of that.

1597
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:05,068
She just saved you a good ass whoopin'.

1598
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,783
- Fuck y'all.
- DJ, change the music.

1599
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,890
- I'm really not the DJ.

1600
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,440
And this my motherfucking spot.

1601
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,350
- Y'all really killed Benny,

1602
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,250
so where can we find Soleraa.

1603
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,950
- Last I remember y'all killed me.

1604
01:21:26,196 --> 01:21:27,029
- Really?

1605
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:30,030
(leg thuds)

1606
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:32,043
- Wait, it's my turn.

1607
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:36,740
- DJ-
- Yeah, I know,

1608
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,613
change the music.

1609
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:48,870
(bright upbeat music)
(vocalizing)

1610
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:10,765
- [Crystal] Where is Soleraa.

1611
01:22:10,765 --> 01:22:13,020
- I can't take no more of this shit, man.

1612
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,530
Need to get to a doctor, man.

1613
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:19,083
187 Pinewood Drive.

1614
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,140
- This is for Nana.

1615
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,473
(gun fires)

1616
01:22:26,654 --> 01:22:28,923
- Man, these bitches crazy.

1617
01:22:28,923 --> 01:22:31,506
(upbeat music)

1618
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:35,090
- Nola, I've been blowing
your phone up all night.

1619
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,730
Why you ain't been answering the phone?

1620
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,010
Is everything okay?

1621
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,647
- No, it's not okay,

1622
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:41,760
but I can't talk about this right now.

1623
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,593
- What's going on?

1624
01:22:42,593 --> 01:22:43,810
I need to know.

1625
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:47,060
- Damon, look, I'll
explain everything later.

1626
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,193
Just please do me a favor for tonight.

1627
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,710
- I'm really not understanding
this, I swear to God.

1628
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,890
What is it that you want me to do?

1629
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,400
- I need you to watch
my niece for tonight.

1630
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,070
- [Damon] Watch your niece?
- Just do me a favor.

1631
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:03,743
I'll pick her up later.
- Wow.

1632
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,713
- [Nola] Please.

1633
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:10,813
- Go get her.

1634
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,258
- All right, let me make a call.

1635
01:23:14,258 --> 01:23:17,460
(indistinct)

1636
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,737
Chris, bring her up.

1637
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:23,820
(dramatic music)

1638
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:26,070
I stashed these just in
case of an emergency.

1639
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:31,947
The crew gonna love these.

1640
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:35,660
(dramatic music)

1641
01:23:39,954 --> 01:23:42,974
(upbeat music)

1642
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:45,974
(singer vocalizing)

1643
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,004
- Here we are.

1644
01:24:24,004 --> 01:24:25,587
I'm on y'all asses.

1645
01:24:27,373 --> 01:24:32,373
(upbeat music)
(singer vocalizing)

1646
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,890
- It's two armed guards upfront.

1647
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:10,787
- Ain't no telling how
many of them in the house.

1648
01:25:10,787 --> 01:25:13,266
- Man, y'all talking too much.

1649
01:25:13,266 --> 01:25:15,683
(gun clicks)

1650
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,190
(car door thuds)

1651
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:25,908
- Shit.

1652
01:25:25,908 --> 01:25:27,491
- [Nola] Let's go.

1653
01:25:32,991 --> 01:25:35,741
(car door thuds)

1654
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:41,964
(phone ringing)

1655
01:25:56,644 --> 01:25:58,977
- Lewis, what the fuck, man?

1656
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,460
- Yeah, those four girls
I've been investigating,

1657
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,060
yeah, Herd, I just followed
them to this location.

1658
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,690
Man, they jumped out this
SUV wearing military gear

1659
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:11,380
with mask and guns,

1660
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,380
something big is about to go down.

1661
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,213
- Wait, what?

1662
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:19,770
What's your location?

1663
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:23,280
- Yeah, I'm on Pinehurst State 1800 Block.

1664
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,306

1665
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:26,306
- I'm on it.

1666
01:26:28,506 --> 01:26:30,923
- I'm on these motherfuckers.

1667
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,743
Bag girls, yeah right
here come a bad bitch.

1668
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:42,473
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1669
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,227
(phone ringing)

1670
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,870
- This better to be important, Herd.

1671
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,314
- I just got word

1672
01:27:08,314 --> 01:27:09,530
there's a hit squad on your block.

1673
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,230
I gotta call it in.

1674
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:12,730
I'm gonna give you 10 minutes.

1675
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,560
- 10 minutes?

1676
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:19,390
(speaks in foreign language)

1677
01:27:24,665 --> 01:27:27,522
(upbeat music)

1678
01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:28,355
- Yeah.

1679
01:27:30,205 --> 01:27:32,784
(guns firing)

1680
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:34,794
I got to get in the hot tub.

1681
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:39,724
(upbeat music)
(singer vocalizing)

1682
01:27:39,724 --> 01:27:42,307
(upbeat music)

1683
01:27:56,297 --> 01:27:57,214
Polo, Polo!

1684
01:28:01,946 --> 01:28:04,363
(indistinct)

1685
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,340
(guns firing)

1686
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:40,868
- Ms. Chanel, you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1687
01:28:40,868 --> 01:28:43,201
He just hit me in the chest.

1688
01:28:44,272 --> 01:28:45,105
I'm on it.

1689
01:28:52,604 --> 01:28:55,507
You can run but you can't hide.

1690
01:28:55,507 --> 01:28:58,672
(gun fires)

1691
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:00,833
(laughs) You dropped your gun.

1692
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,529
(gun firing)

1693
01:29:06,529 --> 01:29:09,730
- Ms. Gucci.
- I'm good, keep moving,

1694
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:11,169
I'm good.
(guns firing)

1695
01:29:11,169 --> 01:29:12,169
Keep moving.

1696
01:29:23,003 --> 01:29:25,163
(gun fires)

1697
01:29:25,163 --> 01:29:27,746
(upbeat music)

1698
01:29:35,025 --> 01:29:37,525
(guns firing)

1699
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:43,053
- [Dee] Die in the dark, bitch!

1700
01:29:43,053 --> 01:29:45,386
(gun fires)

1701
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,850
- Hey, I checked them out,

1702
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,730
They don't have any security guards left,

1703
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:52,810
but I put one of them
motherfuckers in the closet.

1704
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,080
- We did too.

1705
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,670
Shit, let's go finish this.

1706
01:30:02,009 --> 01:30:03,730
You think she got away?

1707
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:06,070
- No, I didn't hear a car starting up.

1708
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:07,670
She's probably still here.

1709
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,640
Let's just keep looking.

1710
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,690
She won't need these Benz keys no more.

1711
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:17,134
(upbeat music)

1712
01:30:29,124 --> 01:30:29,957
- So we having a whole shootout,

1713
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:33,780
and this bitch in the tub like Rev Run.

1714
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:35,447
- Let's get her ass.

1715
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,809
(dramatic music)

1716
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:43,482
Not today cockroaches!

1717
01:30:43,482 --> 01:30:45,982
(guns firing)

1718
01:30:53,892 --> 01:30:56,392
(guns firing)

1719
01:31:11,548 --> 01:31:12,715
- Oh, I'm hit.

1720
01:31:13,764 --> 01:31:15,837
(guns firing)

1721
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:19,001
Run peasants run!

1722
01:31:19,001 --> 01:31:21,566
- Get outta my house.

1723
01:31:21,566 --> 01:31:24,483
(thunder rumbling)

1724
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:28,295
Oh fuck.

1725
01:31:30,592 --> 01:31:32,822
(gun fires)

1726
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:34,203
Fucker.

1727
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:36,953
(dramatic music)

1728
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,040
- Y'all seen Ms. Chanel?
- I ain't seen her

1729
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,190
since the hot tub.

1730
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,970
- Hey, y'all figure her out.

1731
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:05,908
I'm about to go find my cousin.

1732
01:32:05,908 --> 01:32:08,408
(guns firing)

1733
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,883
- Nola.

1734
01:32:19,215 --> 01:32:22,132
(thunder crashing)

1735
01:32:40,412 --> 01:32:41,870
(gun clicking)

1736
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:43,270
- Oh, shit.

1737
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:45,600
- In my country, you bitches
would have been legendary.

1738
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,700
They would've spoke about
the four female brave bandits

1739
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,207
that rob the bad drug dealers,

1740
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:53,170
but you came across the
Queen Solera Castillo.

1741
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,650
Daughter of Miguel Castillo.

1742
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:57,600
And just like my father
eliminated all of his enemies,

1743
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,137
I eliminated you.

1744
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:01,403
- Bitch, shut up.

1745
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:03,950
We the Bag Girls.

1746
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:06,170
We're already legendary.

1747
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:07,128
Poppa...

1748
01:33:07,128 --> 01:33:09,461
(gun fires)

1749
01:33:10,729 --> 01:33:13,002
- Good shot, cuz.

1750
01:33:13,002 --> 01:33:13,835
- Nola.

1751
01:33:15,168 --> 01:33:16,336
(dramatic music)

1752
01:33:16,336 --> 01:33:19,103
- Man, it went through my vest, sis.

1753
01:33:19,103 --> 01:33:19,936
- I know, sis,

1754
01:33:19,936 --> 01:33:22,132
but it's okay, we're gonna
get you to the hospital,

1755
01:33:22,132 --> 01:33:25,690
just like you did for me, remember?

1756
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:28,231
- No, I don't think I can make it.

1757
01:33:28,231 --> 01:33:29,064
Just go.

1758
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:34,257
- Come on, we gotta go.

1759
01:33:34,257 --> 01:33:35,672
Crystal, we gotta leave her.

1760
01:33:35,672 --> 01:33:38,671
- I'm not leaving my sister.

1761
01:33:38,671 --> 01:33:42,249
- Nola, you're a tough motherfucker.

1762
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:43,999
