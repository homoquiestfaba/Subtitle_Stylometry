Good morning, guys.
It's me, Padgett Head to Toe here,

15
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,208
where we talk about makeovers,
self-improvement,

16

the most spectacular you you can be.

are the first thing people see.

I didn't get my full eight last night
because I was up studying,

00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,583

So, this morning's routine is
going to take a little bit extra effort.

already asked a lot of questions.

and then we make our way up
north from there.

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,291
Well, wherever we do end up,

170
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,833
as long as we get back
by August for my orientation.

171
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,166
UC Riverside, really?

172
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,500
What? I think I'd do really well there
without having to work very hard.

173
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,083
Plus, it's near Legoland.

174
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,708
I effing love Legoland.

175
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,833
Isn't UCSD the one near Legoland?

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,791
I think I made a huge mistake.

177
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,708
This is so cool. I've never been
on the set of a music video before.

178
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,833
[woman] Try working on one.
We're an hour behind, wardrobe just quit,

179
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,708
and I am 90% sure I'm getting pink eye.

180
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,416
- Ew.
- Jordan's trailer's this big one here.

181
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,416
Make it fast.
We're calling him to set soon.

182
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,125
Okay, we'll do it live.

183
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,625
When I cue you,
press this and follow me inside.

184
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,250
Yep, I know how to work a phone.

185
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,916
- Thanks.
- And action.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,291
Okay, guys. We're live here, and surprise!

187
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,125
We're on the set
of Jordan's brand-new video

188
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,916
in beautiful Hollywood, California.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,833
- [coughs] Canoga Park.
- Same thing.

190
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,458
[giggles] I can't wait to see his face.

191
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,250
- [knocking]
- Hello?

192
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,583
- [music playing]
- Wow. He's really blasting that music.

193
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,625
Is he listening to himself?

194
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,625
Yeah. So?

195
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,541
Come on.

196
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,625
[trailer door opens]

197
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,166
- [Padgett] Jordan?
- [music playing loudly]

198
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,333
- Jordan!
- Padgett?

199
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,125
- [girl] Padgett!
- What are you doing?

200
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,708
What do you think they're doing?

201
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,666
- Okay, let's not freak out here. Okay?
- Oh my God. I'm so, so sorry.

202
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,375
I have no idea how this happened.

203
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,125
Padgett, I'm such a big fan.

204
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,458
I'm Aniston, by the way.

205
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,958
Your name is Aniston?

206
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,333
It's a family name.

207
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,375
Well, you've made them very proud.

208
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,708
- Thank you.
- [Padgett] Ugh!

209
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,041
- You scumbag!
- Padge.

210
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,958
I made you croquembouche!

211
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,041
[Jordan] Okay.

212
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,625
I even made them with almond flour

213
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,625
so you wouldn't fart
during your precious video!

214
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,916
- Check this out.
- [Padgett] <i>I can't believe you!</i>

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is this why you told me
not to visit the set?

216
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,291
<i>So you could hook up
with the backup dancer?</i>

217
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,809
- [Jordan] No!
- [grunting furiously]

218
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,291
Oh my God! [laughing]

219
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,500
I think I just saw
Jordan Van Draanen's thing.

220
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,708
- [Padgett] <i>Aniston is not a first name!</i>
- Not too shabby, JVD.

221
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,208
[Padgett grunts] I hate you!

222
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,476
- After everything we've been through?
- [Jordan] Padgett!

223
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,708
We're over, okay?

224
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,583
Know what? You don't deserve me, my love,
and you don't deserve my croquembouche.

225
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,458
- You croquem-douche!
- [girl 2] Padgett!

226
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,875
What?! [gasps]

227
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,375
You're still live.

228
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,791
[exhales heavily]

229
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,875
[bangs]

230
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,916
[fading low whir]

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
[phone ringing]

232
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,041
- [Padgett grunts]
- [knocking on door]

233
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,666
Padgett, you feeling okay?
Missing school today?

234
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,166
[Padgett groans] Mom, I'm fine.

235
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,833
I just wanna be alone.

236
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,750
I went through all the trouble
of putting cereal in a bowl with milk.

237
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,083
[Padgett] Lucky Charms? Mom...

238
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,875
I know it's not really
what you eat anymore,

239
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,041
but it cheered you up when you were eight.

240
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,166
Look, I'm just not hungry, okay?

241
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,208
Suit yourself. [spoon taps]

242
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,291
[crunching]

243
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,458
Hmm! Wow. The marshmallows.

244
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,791
- I forgot about the marshmallows.
- Mom.

245
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,416
Give me a break.
I've been eating Mueslix for ten years.

246
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,041
Look, honey,

247
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,375
I do know that breakups are hard,
especially your first.

248
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,083
It's not just the breakup.

249
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,291
I was humiliated.

250
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,541
I know that it feels
like the absolute end of the world now,

251
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,708
but I can promise you
with absolute certainty

252
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,041
that it will get better.

253
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,125
Well, when?

254
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,208
Three months.

255
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,458
Maybe a year. Five tops.

256
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,500
Even if it's just you and me
for the rest of our lives,

257
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,416
what do we do?

258
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,875
We get a couple of twin beds,
fierce matching jumpsuits,

259
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,250
a couple dozen more cats.

260
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,708
It would be great.

261
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,791
[phone ringing]

262
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,958
- Think about it.
- [Padgett sighs]

263
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,458
<i>- Hey.
- </i>There you are. I was so worried.

264
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,541
<i>- We missed you at dance practice.
- </i>Sorry, I saw you called.

265
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,125
<i>- I've kinda just been...
- </i>Avoiding life? Can't say I blame you.

266
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,916
Why did I have to go live?

267
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,541
And why did Alden keep recording?

268
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,500
Because you always go live,
and Alden must have been in shock.

269
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,916
Yeah, well, at least everyone got to see
what an asshole Jordan is.

270
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,708
Yeah, I guess.

271
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,166
You guess?

272
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,625
No! I mean, yes. You're totally right.

273
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,666
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Q, what's going on?

274
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,750
Nothing.

275
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,333
It's just,
I guess you haven't looked online today?

276
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,541
[phone pinging]

277
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,625
[breathing heavily]

278
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,875
[Quinn] <i>Padgett? Hello?
Are you still there?</i>

279
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,791
I think I'm gonna be sick.
How could this happen?

280
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,708
[Quinn]<i> A few people are being
kind of mean.</i>

281
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,625
A few?

[phone pinging]

283
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,708
Bubble Girl?

284
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,750
Who's Bubble Girl?

285
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,625
[clears throat] <i>You are?</i>

286
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,041
How am I Bubble...

287
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,250
Oh my God.

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,958
<i>Padgett, listen to me, okay?
Everything's going to be just fine.</i>

289
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,791
How could you say that? I'm a joke.

290
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm a punchline with a disgusting
mucus-themed nickname. I'm...

291
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,916
[phone vibrates]

292
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,333
- Oh no.
- [Quinn] <i>Who is it?</i>

293
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,041
It's Jessica Miles Torres
from Bunny Venom.

294
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,833
Jessica, hi. What's up?

295
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,500
You're going viral in the wrong way.

296
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,875
Okay, so you saw the video,
and while it is unfortunate...

297
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,250
Unfortunate? My ex-husband's
hiking accident was unfortunate,

298
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,666
and he was mauled by bears.

299
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,458
Oh my God. Is... is he okay?

300
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,000
Better than you.

301
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,416
But, honey, I get it. I can sympathize.

302
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,250
<i>You were betrayed, mistreated, humiliated.</i>

303
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,625
So you do understand?

304
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,833
Of course. The difference is
you completely lost it in front of, like...

305
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,083
A lot of people. I know.

306
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:45,583
[Jessica]
<i>According to my assistant, 217,463.</i>

307
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,458
Look, we pay you
because you're the makeover girl.

308
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,916
<i>People buy products that you recommend.</i>

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,625
And I'm still that girl.

310
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,250
[Jessica] <i>No. You're a meme.</i>

311
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,333
<i>You're Bubble Girl.</i>

312
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,958
And mucus is just not on-brand for us.

313
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,333
<i>But I'm sure
you can get another endorsement.</i>

314
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,583
Maybe with an antihistamine company?

315
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:08,291
So wait, you're pulling my sponsorship?
That's really problematic for my college.

316
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,833
Listen, people want Padgett Head to Toe.

317
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,708
- Not Head to Nose.
- I know I've lost a lot of followers.

318
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,208
But I can get them back.
I just need a chance to redeem myself.

319
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,166
- That's all.
- Sweetie, I am your biggest supporter.

320
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,625
No one has more faith in you than I do.

321
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,458
But until you turn things around,
don't talk to me. Love ya.

322
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,875

[upbeat music playing]

324
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,375
Look, no one feels worse
for Padge than I do.

325
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,916
But you gotta admit,
she kind of brought it on herself.

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,666
You're saying she deserved it?

327
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,666
- Jordan humiliated her.
- Okay, I did not say "deserved."

328
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,583
But after years of this 4.0,
hot boyfriend,

329
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,708
Insta-perfect corporate sponsor streak,
something had to give.

330
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,375
- What had to give?
- Uh, Padge, hi.

331
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,291
Hi.

332
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,958
We thought you might
be taking a personal day.

333
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,333
No, I'm fine.

334
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,291
Hey, Bubble Girl.

335
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,708
- You need me to pop that thing for you?
- Back off, sleazeball!

336
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,958
- Wow. Unbelievable.

00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm pretty sure
the only weird part is you.

505
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,458
Fair enough.

506
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,083
I was hoping to take
a riding lesson this morning.

507
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,886
And I figured
since you and I are friends...

508
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,083
- Ah, friends?
- In the sense we go to school together.

509
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,666
Kind of a loose definition.
Don't you think?

510
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,166
Uh, look, I have a lot of work
to get done before school...

511
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,041
So let me help!
Then if there's time afterwards,

512
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,791
we can squeeze in a lesson.

513
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,500
- You don't even know what the job is.
- That's okay. I am at your service.

514
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,208
Ugh! There's just so much of it. [gags]

515
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,250
What do horses eat anyway?

516
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,000
[Cameron] Well, that one,
Jimbo over there, he likes Chipotle.

517
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,500
Gilly prefers sushi.

518
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,750
Just horse feed. Hay, grass mostly.

519
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,083
Well, this one must have eaten
an entire soccer field.

520
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,666
Well, you offered to help.

521
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,250
I'm starting to think
you've never shoveled crap before.

522
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,833
Only out of a litter box.

523
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,708
And this dump is bigger than my cat.

524
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,833
[chuckles]

525
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,541
So, you really come here
every day before school?

526
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,541
Yep, ever since I was 14.

527
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,750
[shutter clicking]

528
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,500
Wow, you really want to chronicle
your post-poop clean-up look?

529
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,083
I chronicle everything. That's my job.

530
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,083
So, how about that lesson now?

531
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,000
I guess a deal's a deal.

532
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,750
So, do you have
any previous riding experience?

533
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,083
Just one time at a birthday party
when I was five,

534
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,666
but I think it was a baby horse,

535
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,916
or maybe not baby,
but it was small. [chuckles nervously]

536
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,125
Does that count?

537
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:44,166
I believe the word
you're looking for is pony and no.

538
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,125
[inhales] Anyway, this is Gilly.
He can be a little temperamental, so I...

539
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,625
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting him smell my hand.

540
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,791
It's like a handshake for horses.
I did my research last night. [chuckles]

541
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,750
- [soft neighing]
- Whoa. Why is he doing that?

542
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,500
Actually means he likes you.

543
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,166
Oh, well, I guess he has good instincts.

544
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:03,791
Right.

545
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,291
Let's, um, try mounting up.
So come over here.

546
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,041
Put your left foot in the stirrup,
grab the reins with your left hand,

547
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,750
and use your other leg
to haul you up and over.

548
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,041
[Padgett grunts]

549
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,541
- I'm a natural, right?
- Not bad.

550
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,125
[shutter clicking]

551
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,166
[Cameron] Um, seriously?

552
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,833
- More?
- I'm just capturing the moment. [chuckles]

553
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,916
You can't enjoy this without sharing it
with 500 strangers?

554
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,208
Five hundred? Try 887,132.

555
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,625
And they're not strangers.
They're followers.

556
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,666
Followers? You mean like a cult?

557
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,333
No, not like a cult.

558
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,250
Just people devoted to me
and totally guided by my advice

559
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,041
as to how to live their lives.

560
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,625
I'm joking. I was just taking a picture.

561
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,166
- You take pictures. What's the difference?
- Too vast to even explain.

562
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,958
Now, come on off the horse.

563
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,458
- That's it? We're done?
- No.

564
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,500
I just want you
to practice getting on and off.

565
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,291
Oh, uh, okay.

566
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,375
Uh...

567
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,666
- Whoa!
- Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.

568
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,500
[Padgett grunts] Oh!

569

570
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,666
- [Cameron groans]
- Ugh...

571
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,625
- Disgusting!
- [laughs hysterically] Sorry!

572
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:07,583
Sorry for laughing.

573
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,208
It's just I've never seen
such an uncoordinated dismount.

574
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,916
I mean,
aren't you captain of the dance team...

575
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,083
[laughing out loud]

576
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,333
What? It's mostly grass, right?

577
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,875

Uh, Kweller, can we maybe do this later?
I have a French quiz.

584
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
These are the best fares
I've seen in months.

585
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,916
Just, um, give me your phone.

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,958
- What's wrong with yours?
- Really?

587
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,750
Your aversion to technology
is becoming a character flaw.

588
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:46,833
Hey, guys.

589
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,708
Uh... hey?

590
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,708
I wanted to say thank you
for this morning.

591
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,416
My butt is so sore. I could barely walk.

592
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,041
Things got messy.

593
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,041
Uh, context, please?

594
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,333
- I gave her a riding lesson.
- I bet you did.

595
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,083
Horse riding.

596
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,625
- Mm-hmm.
- Part of one, anyway.

597
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:07,375
And as a way of saying thanks,
there is a karaoke party this Saturday

598
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:11,083
at my friend Quinn's house,
and I was hoping you guys could come.

599
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,958
- Uh, yeah. Um, I don't... I don't...
- We'll be there.

600
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:18,291
Perfect. So Cameron,
should I like, SMS you the address?

601
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,291
Kweller's phone is
an antiquated piece of crap.

602
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,791
- Why don't you send it to me?
- Awesome. Okay.

603
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,458
- Okay, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- [Nisha] Totally.

604
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,458
What the hell?

605
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:30,875
You've been talking about wanting
to go on all these exotic adventures.

606
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:34,666
Why don't you just think of this
as an adventure close to home.

Yeah. This is cool. You do this often?

Uh, I'm just really private, that's all.

835
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,791
But, um...
if you really wanna see what I do...

836
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:08,875
Yes.

837
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,375
Okay.

838
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,750
So you've really never been
to Union Station?

839
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,541
Honestly, I didn't even know
this was here.

840
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,750
Is that terrible?

841
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,416
Uh, yeah, kind of. [laughs]

842
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,541
It's like a classic,
old-timey train station.

843
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:26,458
Well, it's actually
a working train station

844
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,083
where people take trains.

845
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,541

[shutter clicks]

847
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,958
Then again, you don't strike me
as the public-transportation type.

848
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,416
I carpool to school.

849
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,000
In your friend's Lexus.

850
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,208
Hey, Mr. Cahill.

851
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,333
- Hey, Cam.
- This place is amazing.

852
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,666
I guess I never come downtown
because it's always so crowded.

853
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,125
With street photography, crowds are
the point. Makes it easier to blend in.

854
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,375
People don't mind you
just taking their picture?

855
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,791
Uh, well, it depends.

856
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,875
Sometimes I ask permission,
sometimes I don't.

857
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:59,666
But after a while, you kind of develop
a sense of when it's okay to shoot.

- And when to run.
- [chuckles]

861
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,666
- Thanks, Gene. Here you go.
- Mm.

862
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,750
Gene's Nutella lattes are insane.

863
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:17,166
- Mm-hmm. [chuckles]
- [Padgett] Mm.

864
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,541
Wait, are you actually smiling?

865
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,208
What?

866
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,708
I don't know.
I've just never seen you like this.

867
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,916
What do you mean?

868
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,208
Well, at school,
you're this really reserved person,

869
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,958
but at the stables
or here with your camera...

870
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,083
Oh, maybe it's because

871
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,666
no one in those places
ever keyed the word "loser"

872
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,833
into my truck door
or put a fetal pig in my backpack.

873
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,333
Ouch.

874
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,500
Yeah.

875
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,875
It doesn't matter.

876
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:50,458
High school's a bunch of scared people
pretending to be something they're not.

877
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,166
[chuckles] But this place?

878
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,625
This place is real.

879
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:56,708
Just like horses.

880
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,625

in the entire animal kingdom.

881
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,208
So what about Gilly?

882
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,416
- Does he think I'm full of crap?
- You think I'd be here with you if he did?

883
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,208
Sorry things are so bad for you at school.

884
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:12,916
Guess I'd be in a hurry to graduate too.

885
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah, I'm only doing it
so my grandmother doesn't freak out.

886
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,458
Yeah, why do you and Brin live with her?

887
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,041
Sorry, if that's...

888
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,583
No, no, no. No, it's okay.

889
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:24,583
Well, you know our father lives in Sweden.

890
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,208
- His choice.
- [Padgett] Mm-hmm.

891
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,333
And after our mom died and...

892
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:31,250
Oh, I am so sorry.

893
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,166
[Cameron] Yeah, it's four years ago.
Plane crash.

894
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,416
She was dating this guy named Marcus,
who flew a turboprop.

895
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:43,208
And one Saturday morning,
they were on their way back from Laramie,

896
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,250
and, um...

897
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,250
You must miss her a lot.

898
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,875
Yeah, Mom was awesome.

899
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,958
In fact, she is the one
who gave me this camera.

900
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,041
So that's why you love it so much.

901
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,541
Yeah. So what about your family?

902
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,791
Well, my parents are divorced.

903
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,208
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

904
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:08,416
Um, my dad lives in Florida
with his new family.

905
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,500
And I'm here with my mom.

906
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:14,125
- Okay, what does she do?
- She's a nurse.

907
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,125
Hmm.

908
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,968
[Padgett]
I've never told anyone that before.

909
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:20,958
She works her ass off
to give me every opportunity in the world.

910
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:25,208
And sometimes I'm scared
I won't be able to make it up to her.

911
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:28,333
- [shutter clicks]
- Hey, did I say you could do that?

912
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,333
No. That's the whole idea
of a candid shot.

913
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:34,166
If you know I'm going to take a photo,
then you gotta fix your hair,

914
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,041
and you do that whole duck-face thing.

915
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,416
- Yes. That's exactly it.

Uh... sorry.

Uh, depends.

920

- Are you free next weekend?
- Why?

921
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,125
It's my friend Alden's birthday,
and she's having a theme party.

922
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,708
Okay, what's the theme?

923
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,208
It's Drop it like F. Scott.
It's a <i>Great Gatsby </i>thing.

924
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,208
Yeah, she does realize
those parties in the book

925
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,416
represent the shallowness
of the ruling class, right?

926
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,791
Sadly, that is the appeal.

927
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,791
- Okay.
- [Padgett] So what do you think?

928
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,892
- You down to get bougie together?
- [Cameron] Yeah.

929
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,375
Can I bring some people?

930
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,541
Sure. Yeah.
Bring whoever you want. [chuckles]

931

[Brin] Oh my God! Oh my God!

932
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,958
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I have the best brother ever.

933
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,833
He has his moments.

934
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:21,875
Okay. It's a roaring '20s theme,

935
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,041
so there's a million ways
we can go with this.

936
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:27,041
Yeah, but we're
only gonna try like, three, right?

the same three plaids since 2017?

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Wow.

1004
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,708
Your camera? Really?

1005
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,250
This is the only time
I'm gonna be doing something like this.

1006
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,375
- Might as well document it.
- Hey, everybody. Padgett Head to Toe here.

1007
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:41,375
Outside of Alden Pierce's
18th birthday party.

1008
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:45,083
If you can't already tell,
the theme is Drop It Like F. Scott.

1009
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,375
I'm here with my amazing new friends.

1010
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,458
Cameron.

1011
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:50,833
- Brin.
- Hi, guys.

1012
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,000
And Nisha.

1013
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,750
This is insane.

1014
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,791
You're hot now. Get used to it.

1015
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,666
Uh, no, I was talking about the party.

1016
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,750
[speaking indistinctly]

1017
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,125
This one's teeny compared to her sweet 16.

1018
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,416
We went to the beach.

1019
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,750
In Turks and Caicos.

1020
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:34,125
Can you believe this?

1021
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,333
- [Alden] Padge!
- Hey! Mwah, mwah.

1022
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,583
Hi. I'm Alden.

1023
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,041
Birthday girl.

1024
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,250
Yeah, we've met.

1025
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,333
Oh.

1026
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:44,750
Oh!

1027
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,333
I'm sorry, I gotta ask.
What are you drinking?

1028
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:50,833
Oh, it's my signature bday mocktail.

1029
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:54,791
It's got cranberry juice,
fresh raspberries, cherry Pop Rocks.

1030
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:59,416
Hi, I just wanted to say happy birthday
and thank you so much for inviting me.

1031
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,166
[scoffs] I'm sorry. Who are you?

1032
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,166
Uh, Brin Kweller.

1033
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,125
- I thought I was in...
- Hey, uh...

1034
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,916
We're gonna go get some drinks,
and we'll see you guys in a bit.

1035
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,625
Bye.

1036
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:13,583
Padge, I don't know what you did
to that Cameron guy, but damn!

1037
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,000
What you did?

1038
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh, she means his costume.

1039
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,791
And Cameron did that himself.

1040
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,125
Wow, you might
just win this bet after all.

1041
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,875
Yeah, if you don't blow it for me first.

1042
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,625
- Guess we'll see who's gonna be a loser.
- We'll see.

1043
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,041
So, Aniston just bailed on you, bro?

1044
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:31,666
Yeah, bro.

1045
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:35,916
I was on my way to pick her up,
and she texted me and said it's over.

1046
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,208
Said she's going to Brent Rivera's
birthday party with that other dude.

1047
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,833
That sucks, bro.

1048
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,625
That Aniston chick was hot.
If I were you, I'd be crying too.

1049
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:47,166
That's okay. [sighs]
My fans love my vulnerability.

1050
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,250
- Wait, you guys aren't recording?
- Oh!

1051
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,958
- Shoot, my bad.
- Oh my God.

1052
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:56,083
Guys! All right, come on.
I need another take.

1053
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,333
[exhales] Okay. You got this.

1054
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,458
[sighs] Damn, I lost it.
Always be recording.

1055
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,291
- My bad. That was my fault.
- All right?

1056
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:08,458
I still can't believe she'd ditch me
for some rando loser

1057
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,833
who's only got 318,000 followers.

1058
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,583
Well, he does play for the Clippers.

1059
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,583
Yeah, that's pretty dope.

1060
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,125
[laughing]

1061
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,916
[upbeat music playing]

1062
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,083
[shutter clicking]

1063
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,583
[shutter clicking]

1064
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,791
[Padgett] Don't tell me
you're actually having fun.

1065
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,458
Why would you say that?

1066
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:36,333
This party is ridiculous.

1067
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,666
[singing] You're having fun.
You're having fun.

1068
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,083
[Cameron] Maybe a little.

1069
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,166
[Nisha] Hey.

1070
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,458
Nice costume.

1071
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,541
[scoffs] Didn't think I'd see
another Jordan Baker.

1072
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,791
Daisy is so overrated. [laughs]

1073
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:50,875
Totally.

1074
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:55,375
Wow. I look like
the before picture for you.

1075
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,875
Stop. You look great.

1076
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,875
You were at my karaoke party.

1077
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:03,041
Right. I was the one
who didn't bring their swimsuit.

1078
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:06,708
- Yeah. I'm sorry it turned weird.
- It's okay. Weird's totally my thing.

1079
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,250
[chuckling]

1080
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,875
Oh my God. [gags]

1081
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:12,166
- They put them in the ice too?
- [laughs]

1082
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,458
Come on. I know where Alden keeps
her non-Pop-Rock-aholic drinks.

1083
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:16,916
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1084
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,333
Hey, you.

1085
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,875
Whoa, whoa.
You're not even gonna say, "Hey"?

1086
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:23,833
Blow me.

1087
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:25,500
You're Aniston's problem now.

1088
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,625
You're still mad about that?
That was like, two weeks ago.

1089
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,500
- Hey.
- Dude! What the hell?

1090
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,303
I'm sorry.
I had something else to tell you.

1091
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,750
- What?
- [Jordan] I don't know.

1092
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,458
That... I'm sorry.

1093
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:39,083
And that she was right.

1094
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,666
- Who?
- [Jordan] Aniston.

1095
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,541
She said that I wasn't over you,

1096
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,875
and... that's the truth.

1097
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,250
We belong together, Padge.

1098
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,833
Now, come on. These nominations
are on Monday, all right?

1099
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:56,041
If we win prom king and queen,
our followers would go crazy.

1100
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,125
I don't care!

1101
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,791
Oh, and by the way,
there are no mean streets of Pali.

1102
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,250
You live on the same block
as Gwyneth Paltrow.

1103
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:09,666
Oh man! You spilled my watermelon.
It was the last one.

1104
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,208
Now, all they have is mango.

1105
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:14,041
I hate mango. It's a terrible flavor.

1106
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,750
Hey.

1107
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,833
Is everything okay?

1108
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,500
Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh, spilled my drink.

1109
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:26,041
But I was thinking about going
to get another one, though.

1110
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,708
Any chance you want to come with me?

1111
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:31,916
[giggles] Sure.

1112
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,833
Let's go.

1113
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,708
[speaking indistinctly]

1114
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,541
[shutter clicks]

1115
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:41,291
Okay, enough pictures for you.
No one's going to see them anyways.

1116
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,041
I have a better idea. Come on.

1117
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,250
Oh, photo booth? Seriously?

1118
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,833
- Come on. I want to see your duck face.
- Ugh.

1119
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:48,916
[sighs]

1120
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,666
Now show me what you got.

1121
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,750
[shutter clicking]

1122
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:53,708
[shutter clicking]

1123
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,333
You're not supposed to look at me.

1124
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:56,875
- You're supposed to pose.
- Sorry.

1125
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:01,125
I guess I'm just mesmerized
by watching you disfigure yourself.

1126
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,708
So you're repulsed?

1127
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:06,000
Totally, but it must be so hard
to make yourself look terrible

1128
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,166
when you're naturally so, you know...

1129
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,250
What?

1130
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:11,791
Beautiful.

1131
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,708
[party DJ] All right, everyone,
let's gather by the big cake

1132
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,833
to sing Alden "Happy Birthday."

1133
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:23,208
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1134
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,125
Stop it.

1135
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,500
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>
- [Jordan] Ow!

1136
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,541
<i>- ♪ To you ♪</i>
- [Brin] Get away from me, asshole!

1137
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,833
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday... ♪</i>
- Hey, Brin, what's going on?

1138
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,833
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

1139
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:34,791
- It was nothing.
- You call that nothing?

1140
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:37,208
- What happened? What did he do?
- She's so overreacting.

1141
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,500
- You, shut up.
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

1142
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,750
So I said, "Okay."

1143
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,583
And then we went into this big room
with a pool table.

1144
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:46,333
- And we were just kissing.
- See? No big deal.

1145
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,791
But then he started going for more,
so I bonked him with a pool ball.

1146
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:52,291
- Which hurt, by the way.
- Freaking piece of shit.

1147
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:55,750
- Don't tell me she's your girlfriend?
- No, she's my little sister, you idiot.

1148
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,625
And if you ever touch her again...

1149
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,583
What, you wanna go? You wanna go, man?

1150
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:03,375
- Let's go. Let's get it.
- Why'd you just take off your shirt?

1151
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,791
I don't know. That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

1152
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,333
- What?
- No, Cameron, come on.

1153
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,000
[Padgett] He is not worth it.

1154
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,000
No, not this time.

1155
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:19,125
- [Padgett] Cameron, please.
- [boy 1] Move back. Make some room.

1156
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,666
[boy 2] You got it! You got it!

1157
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,500
If you ever go near my sister again...

1158
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:23,625
- What?
- [all] Ooh!

1159
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,750
[Jordan's friend] Haha. Okay, okay.

1160
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:27,000
- [grunts]
- [crowd gasps]

1161
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,625
- [grunts]
- [crowd] Oh!

1162
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,375
- [grunts]
- [crowd] Oh!

1163
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,375
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

1164
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,000
- Yes!
- Oh!

1165
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,791
Classic Johnny Wang move.

1166
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,083
What the hell was that?

1167
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,125
I'm sure that was me kicking your ass.

1168
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,208

I... I don't know.

1204

Maybe I just sensed there was more to you
than what you let everyone see.

00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,500
[Padgett] Wow. Look at you.

1338
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:12,916
- Who is it?
- [Quinn] Nothing.

1339
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,375
- It's stupid.
- [Padgett] Really?

1340
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:17,916
- Then why are you blushing?
- I'm not blushing. It's just a funny text.

1341
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,041
- Mm. A stupid, funny text from...
- Nisha.

1342
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,333
- Q! That's amazing.
- [Quinn chuckles]

1343
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:25,458
I thought I saw
you guys talking at the party.

1344
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah, she's pretty great.

1345
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,291
I was thinking about asking her to prom.

1346
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:33,333
No way. Oh my God, that's so great.
You guys would be so cute together.

1347
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,875
- So how are you gonna ask her?
- Hey, um...

1348
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:37,958
You got a sec?

1349
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:40,500
Go. I'll talk to you later.

1350
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,791
I didn't think
you were talking to me anymore.

1351
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,583
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1352
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,291
I got really pissed off,
but you didn't do anything.

1353
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,541
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

1354
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,791
Hey! You, my man, are a rock star.

1355
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:56,375
Inspiration. Do you want to hear a poem?

1356
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:57,916
Sure.

1357
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,250
<i>Um, Cameron Kweller</i>

1358
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,750
<i>Interstellar</i>

1359
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,041
<i>Stood up to the dick</i>

1360
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:04,833
<i>Made it stick</i>

1361
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,791
<i>Cameron, one</i>

1362
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,041
<i>Jordan, zero</i>

1363
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,250
<i>King Cameron, you're my hero</i>

1364
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,500
Fight the power, man.

1365
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,375
That was great.

1366
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,458
- [crunches]
- [painfully] Ah, worth it.

1367
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,208
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

1368
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:20,291
Can you believe all this prom BS?

1369
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:23,666
I know. Pretty cool, right?
I mean, what do you think?

1370
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,041
Well, that's actually
what I wanted to talk to you about.

1371
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:28,041
[bell rings]

1372
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,125
Uh, but now I'm late for Art History.

1373
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:34,083
Um, is there any chance
you could come over after school?

1374
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:37,333
- There's something I wanted to show you.
- Um, sure.

1375
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,541
- I'll be there.
- Cool.

1376
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:40,041
Bye.

1377
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,375
- [door closes]
- So this whole prom king thing,

1378
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,041
I can't believe you're actually into it.

1379
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:51,708
Well, I'm not really,
but I do hate Van Draanen.

1380
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:55,208
Guys like him crap all over everyone
and somehow still end up on top.

1381
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,750
Not this time.
Not if I have anything to do with it.

1382
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,333
- That sounded confident.
- 'Cause I am.

1383
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:03,250
And after Alden's party,
you have some serious traction.

1384
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,750
But you're gonna have to let
people see the real Cam Kweller.

1385
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:10,125
Well, speaking of the real me,
right this way.

1386
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,708
Wow. I cannot believe
you have your own darkroom.

1387
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,041
Yeah.

1388
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,333
It was my 14th birthday present.

1389
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,583
So you've been taking pictures
your whole life then?

1390
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:29,625
[Cameron] Kind of.
Used to be more of a hobby,

1391
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,666
but now I don't know.

1392
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:35,458
Sometimes I feel like
I could spend my entire life in this room.

1393
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,875
Cameron, these are amazing.

1394
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:42,416
So why are you letting me see them now?

1395
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,750
Well, you wouldn't stop asking,

1396
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,250
so I figured this was
the only way to get you to stop.

1397
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:51,708
Well, you are very talented.

1398
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:53,208
I mean, look at this one. Oh!

1399
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,583
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

1400
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:56,666
It's, uh...

1401
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,625
It's okay.

1402
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:00,208
Really.

1403
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:03,291
You know, you could
totally make money at this, right?

1404
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,958
You know I don't care about money.

1405
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,458
Or not,
but keeping your talent locked away.

1406
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,041
What are you hiding from?

1407
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,166
You know,
I could ask you the same question.

1408
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,625
What are you talking about?

1409
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:18,500
Well, I'm talking about this.

1410
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,666
And, uh... this.

1411
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And these.

1412
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,791
Not the eyelashes,
they're glued on pretty tight.

1419
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:47,916
Listen, Cameron,
there's something I need to tell you.

1420
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,208
- And I need to tell you something too.
- Okay?

1421
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:55,041
Well, you asked me why I invited you here,

1422
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:58,208
and I don't even let
my own grandmother in here.

1423
01:00:58,291 --> 01:00:59,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

1424
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:02,416
Which is why she probably thinks
I'm running a meth lab.

1425
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,583
[both laughing]

1426
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,541
So then why am I here?

1427
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:07,583
Because I trust you.

1428
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,333
[Padgett] Oh, okay.

1429
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,708
- Well, I...
- [Cameron] Are you okay?

1430
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:16,666
Totally, I just... I need to go.

1431
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:20,250
- Besides, I've wasted enough of your time.
- I wouldn't put it that way.

1432
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:23,583
No, that's not what I meant.
I just... I have somewhere to be.

1433
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,916
- Um... Call you later?
- [Cameron] Yeah.

1434
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:27,666
Sure.

1435
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:36,791
Hey, you got a sec?

1436
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,958
Uh, yeah. Why?

1437
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:42,083
I just kind of wanted
your advice on something.

1438
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,875
If it isn't the fountain of truth

1439
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:48,083
coming to get help
figuring out the world of bullshit.

1440
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,166
Yeah, funny.

1441
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,375
Here's the deal. Uh...

1442
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,750
Things with Padgett may have gotten
a little more complicated than I thought.

1443
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:59,333
Okay. Complicated good or complicated bad?

1444
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:04,250
'Cause the other night at that party,
I was definitely sensing chemistry.

1445
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,625
Oh, wait.

1446
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:06,833
Did you guys hook up?

1447
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:08,750
Oh my God, you did!

1448
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:12,000
No, no, no. We didn't hook up, we...

1449
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:14,000
we kissed.

1450
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:18,250
[shrieks] I knew it! Oh my God.
This is huge. So did you ask her to prom?

1451
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:21,208
It makes sense if you go together.
And if you're king and queen?

1452
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:22,500
How amazing would that be?

1453
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:24,791
It would be like
Cali's own royal love story.

1454
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,291
- [chuckles] And you're the princess.
- Whoa, whoa.

1455
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,166
Yes. I thought about asking her,

1456
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,333
but after we kissed,
things just kind of got weird.

1457
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,958
Of course they did. It's fine.

1458
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,541
First kisses can be awkward.

1459
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,000
First time having sex,
that can be even weirder.

1460
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,833
So is the last time

1461
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:43,791
'cause you never know
if it's gonna be your last.

1462
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,625
Oh...

1463
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,791
Wait, you've never had sex.

1464
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:50,000
Yeah, but I know things, though.
Like this.

1465
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:52,523
If you're worried about
whether you should ask Padgett or not,

1466
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:53,958
just ask yourself one question.

1467
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,208
Okay, what's that?

1468
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:56,750
Who kissed who first?

1469
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,375
Actually, she kissed me first.

1470
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,375
So I should ask her to prom, then.

1471
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:05,208
Um, yeah, but you can't just ask, okay?

1472
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:07,458
It's lame. You have to prompose.

1473
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:10,166
What the hell is that?

1474
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,833
[upbeat music playing]

1475
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:13,625
[laughing]

1476
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,041
[girl screams]

1477
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,125
[speaking indistinctly]

1478
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:24,666
- [Quinn] Hey.
- Hey.

1479
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,083
[Quinn] No word from Cameron?

1480
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:30,208
No, he must think I'm such a freak.
I practically sprinted out of there.

1481
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:33,041
He had the nomination.
Why'd screw it up by kissing him?

1482
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,958
- [Quinn] I do have one theory.
- Yeah?

1483
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,541
You really like him, Padge,
and when you like someone

1484
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:40,791
the other stuff
just doesn't matter as much.

1485
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,041
I do.

1486
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,416
I do like him.

1487
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,500
Yeah.

1488
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:48,541
Something tells me you might not
have screwed up as much as you think.

1489
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,208
- What do you mean?
- [boy] Hey, look, look!

1490
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:54,208
Oh my God, Cameron.

1491
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:57,291
I know this isn't
usually my style, obviously,

1492
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,541
but, uh... what do you think?

1493
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,458
- I think yes.
- [Alden] Sorry.

1494
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:06,791
I hate to interrupt this adorable moment,
but don't you think there's something

1495
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,291
you should tell Cameron first?

1496
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,434
- What are you doing?
- [Quinn] Leave her alone, Alden.

1497
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,708
- [Alden] Shut up, Quinn.
- What's going on?

1498
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,375
Padgett, do you want
to tell him, or should I?

1499
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:19,125
- What's she talking about?
- What I was trying to tell you yesterday.

1500
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,708
It's... It's actually funny.

1501
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,583
After Jordan and I broke up,

1502
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,375
I lost my sponsorships, my college money,

1503
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,125
so I panicked.

1504
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:30,250
- Yeah, she's not lying. Total meltdown.
- Yeah, thanks to you, Alden.

1505
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,916
So I made a bet with Alden

1506
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,458
that I could take some person
and... and... and make them over.

1507
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,916
Some person. What kind of person?

1508
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,458
- Can we talk about this in private?
- No, what kind of person, Padgett?

1509
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:45,166
The biggest loser
so she could turn him into prom king.

1510
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,583
- But that was before...
- Wait. So I was a bet?

1511
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,333
- [Padgett] No...
- No, I was a fucking bet.

1512
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,208
You can all go to hell.

1513
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,166
Let's go.

1514
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,750
[Padgett sighs]

1515
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:02,541
Yikes, that was hard to watch.

1516
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,583
<i>Hey, it's Cameron.
Leave a message, or don't.</i>

1517
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,875
Cameron, it's me again.

1518
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:22,250
I know I covered this
in the 800 texts you haven't returned,

1519
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:25,458
but I'm so sorry,

1520
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,958
and I just want to make sure you're okay.

1521
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,666
He's still not answering?

1522
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,166
[Padgett] No, but can you blame him?

1523
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:37,000
No, but right now,
I'm a little bit more worried about you.

1524
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,458
You and your god-awful ironing.

1525
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:41,041
Please let me do that. Please.

1526
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:45,583
You know,
I convinced myself that I did my posts

1527
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:49,833
because I cared about my followers,
but maybe I was just doing it for myself

1528
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:52,458
to get money and get popular.

1529
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:54,916
Maybe I'm just a fraud.

1530
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,625
Honey, I happen to know
for a fact that you're not a fake.

1531
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,916
You're a truly kind and caring person.

1532
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,375
But I hurt someone, Mom.
I mean, I really hurt him.

1533
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,458
All right, yeah.

1534
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:07,958
You screwed up, but it's only a mistake
if you don't learn from it.

1535
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,875
I just don't even know what to do anymore.

1536
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:14,208
If I win tomorrow night, I'll have to go
in front of all these people...

1537
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,833
And be yourself.

1538
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:19,875
But... what if I don't even like
who that is anymore?

1539
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,708
Listen, I know
it feels like that right now.

1540
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:26,416
I do. But the Padgett Sawyer that I know,

1541
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,875
the kind, sweet, generous,

1542
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:33,583
sure, stubborn girl
that I've known for 18 years,

1543
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:36,583
well, she gets lost now and again.

1544
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:40,708
We all do,
but she always finds her way back.

1545

Oh, Gilly.

1548
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:52,541
I thought you were
a good judge of character. [sniffs]

[Mom sighs]

1551
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,000
All right.

1552
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,166
- How do I look?
- Gorge.

1553
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,041
You're gonna be the queen
of the chaperones.

1554
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,000
[car honks]

1555
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:06,875
Thank you. It looks like my car is here.
All right, put your dress on.

1556
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,166
I'll see you there.

1557
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,083
Okay.

1558
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,750

<i>- You're really gonna go through with this?
- </i>I mean...

1562
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,833
I know I'm not gonna get what I want,

1563
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,958
so at least this way, I have a chance
to make things right with Cameron.

1564
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,125
- Ha! Wanna bet?
- Too soon.

1565

<i>I mean, he's your best friend,</i>

1567
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:34,666
<i>but I think I've really fallen for him,
so I have to try.</i>

1568
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,458
You have one big problem.
There's no way that dude is going to prom.

1569
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,166
Yeah.

1570
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:43,208
So I guess that means
there's only one person left to ask.

1571

[phone rings]

1572
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,750
Screw off, Bubble Girl.

1573
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,250
Okay, a little harsh,

1574
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,041
<i>but I have to ask.</i>

1575
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:59,208
Is he okay?

1576
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,125
I don't know. He's at work.

1577
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:04,291
<i>Why do you keep calling me?
Aren't you supposed to be at prom?</i>

1578
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,166
Yeah, like half an hour ago.

<i>But I have
a really important favor to ask.</i>

1580

Tell me why in the hell I should help you.

1581
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:14,958
I can't, and I know you two
have lost so much more than me,

1582
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,333
but I've lost a lot recently.

1583
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,416
I lost my self-respect.

1584
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,750
<i>I lost my college fund.</i>

1585
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,750
I lost my friends,

1586
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:31,083
but the only thing
I truly care about losing...

1587
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,541
is your brother.

Hey.

01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:52,958
What's in the bag?

1595
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:56,666
Formal wear, or the closest thing
I could find to it in your closet.

1596
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,375
Dude, it's a disaster in there.

1597
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:01,416
Why are there
so many Skittles on the floor?

1598
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,000
Because I spilled some Skittles.
Look, if that's for prom, I...

1599
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:08,625
Look, I know what you're gonna say,
okay, and... I get it.

1600
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,250
Padgett screwed up.

1601
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,083
What she did was mean
and selfish and wrong.

1602
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:15,291
Yes, exactly. So why are you here?

1603
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,541
Because, Cam...

1604
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:21,125
I've... I've missed you.

No, no. I mean, like...

1607
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,666
I miss the way you used to be,
you know? Before...

1608
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:29,458
Before Mom.

1609
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,625
[sniffs] Ever since
you've been with Padgett, okay,

1610
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:38,000
you've been back, and you've been
smiling again, and you've been happy.

1611
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:41,958
And I just feel like... [sniffs]
...for the first time since we moved here

1612
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,708
that I have my brother back.

1613
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:46,416
And don't lose her, Cam.

1614
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:50,500
We lost mom, and there's nothing
we could have done about that,

1615
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:53,916
but now you have a choice,
so just... just don't lose her, okay?

- What do you want, Alden?

1620

Nothing, I just noticed
you didn't bring Cameron.

- So...
- He's not coming. Okay?

1622

You win the bet.

1623
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:23,458
And when are you gonna become
a permanent loser?

1624
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,666
I'll get it done as soon as I can. Happy?

1625
