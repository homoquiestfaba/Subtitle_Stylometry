the senator's career.

00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,361
It didn't.

00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,930
Now, decades later, in the
midst of a comeback, he's

00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,799
poised to be the next president
of the United

7

States, and she's
lost everything.

8
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,840
I asked her if she would
tell her son.

00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,742

[honking]

00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,537
-15 minutes I've been waiting.

00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,572
-The place was a madhouse.

16
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:27,906
It took longer than I thought.

17
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,374
-Well, then call or text.

18
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,444
You just left me standing on
the street like an idiot.

19
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,962
Now, we're gonna have
to make this quick.

20
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,463
We can't leave her
any options.

21
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,465
-She does have a say
in this, you know.

22
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,067
-No, she doesn't.

23
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,402
She obviously can't care
for herself anymore.

24
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,771
Some stranger?

25
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,773
-Elliot, that's how
it's done, OK?

26
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,642
You can't just leave her
alone out in the

00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,709

all right?

-What are you doing here?

38
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,260
-Nice to see you too.

39
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:35,767
-That bad, huh?

40
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,736
-You lost a lot of weight.

41
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,071
-I know.

42
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:42,040
It's my coffee and
cancer diet.

43
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,742
I'm gonna write a book.

44
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:47,579
-We thought you were
in remission.

45
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,752
-Someone called and told me that
you checked yourself out

47
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,090

49
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,627
-Oh, Laura, give it
a rest, will you?

50
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,529
-No, I'm not gonna
give it a rest.

51
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,298
What's going on?

52
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,632
-OK, relax.

53
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,805
-Would one of you go make
me a cup of tea?

54
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,580
-Sure.

55
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,894
-You want milk?

56
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,429
-Just honey, thanks.

57
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,347
-Look, she knows just
how to piss me off.

58
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,720
-Hello.

59
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,855
Sorry, didn't mean
to startle you.

60
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,428
I'm Ted Kingsley.

61
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,164
I called you last night.

62
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,765
-Laura.

63
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,435
-And you must be Elliot?

64
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,271
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,008
Your mom has told me a
lot about you both.

66
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,509
-Who are you again?

67
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,477
-I'm the groundskeeper.

68
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,814
-What happened to Hector?

69
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,415
-He left.

70
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,685
I think he and your mom
had a disagreement.

71
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,055
-OK, well, do you have a number
we can reach you at?

72
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:41,126
I'm sure we'll have some
questions for you.

73
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,728
-I, um, I live here.

74
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,301
-You live here?

75
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,703
-I have a room down the hall.

76
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,538
I've been here about
six months.

77
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,442
-Six months?

78
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,354
-I was going to cook dinner.

79
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,530
-What in the hell's
going on here?

80
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,366
-What are you talking about?

81
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,936
-You were in a hospital, you
look like shit and you live

82
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,004
with some strange guy--

83
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,939
-You met Ted.

84
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,574
He's a dear.

85
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,476
-Why does he live here?

86
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,045
-Because he's probably
trying to take

87
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,182
advantage of you for starters.

88
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,017
-Don't be ridiculous.

89
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,987
-Well, what happened
to Hector?

90
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:45,524
-We had a parting of the ways.

91
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,360
-Why does the groundskeeper
have to move in?

92
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:53,598
-Oh, Laura, I don't have it
in me to fight with you.

93
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,167
Not now, OK?

94
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,877
-Ma, I just want to know
what's going on

95
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,412
here, that's all.

96
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,019
-What's going on here is that
you and your brother haven't

97
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:18,490
even seen me in a year
and a half so my

98
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,824
life is a little different.

99
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,764
That's my business.

100
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,873
-So are you sleeping with
this Ted character?

101
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,644
-I wish.

102
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,193
-Your brother was telling
me that your

103
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,629
father hated this place.

104
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,164
I can't imagine that.

105
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,134
-My father didn't
hate this place.

106
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,571
He hated my mother.

107
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,507
-Well, that must have made
for some hilarious dinner

108
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,842
conversation.

109
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,929
-This is great.

110
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,297
-Ted cooks all organic.

111
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,433
-Well, it's from your
greenhouses.

112
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,004
-You cook every night?

113
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,640
-Not every night but most.

114
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,109
-Why?

115
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,379
-Well, I cook for myself
every night anyways.

116
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:26,151
Plus, it's no fun cooking
for just you, you know?

117
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:29,354
-So you're the groundskeeper
and the cook?

118
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,322
-He's a better cook than
groundskeeper.

119
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,195
Ted's also a very
talented writer.

120
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,131
-Have you published anything?

121
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,933
-I had a novel out last year.

122
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,669
-I sent it to you for
your birthday.

123
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,840
-The one about the woman who
comes home from the war?

124
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,408
TED (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

125
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,476
-I read that.

126
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,477
-You're the one.

127
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,978
-No, I loved it.

128
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,080
I thought she should
have murdered the

129
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,816
grandmother in the end.

130
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,085
-She did in a previous draft.

131
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,386
-That book was kind
of a big deal.

132
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,489
I remember seeing it on
some bestseller list.

133
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,659
ELLIOT (OFFSCREEN): So you're
working on your next one?

134
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,596
-Yeah, I figured a change of
scenery would give me a fresh

135
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,865
perspective.

136
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:18,269
-Ted, do you administer
meds to my mother?

137
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,804
-Excuse me?

138
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,339
-Laura.

139
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,879
-I'm not a home health
attendant, if that's what

140
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,148
you're asking.

141
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,283
LAURA (OFFSCREEN): What is
your role here then?

142
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,386
-There is nothing inappropriate
about Ted's

143
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,688
presence here.

144
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,223
Now that's enough.

145
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,429
-Ted, would you mind letting
my family have a private

146
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,764
discussion?

147
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,536
-I'll be in the kitchen.

148
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,379
-Why don't you just jump in
his lap, for Christ sake.

149
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,848
(MOCKINGLY) I think that book
was quite a big deal.

150
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,651
-Stop it.

151
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,486
Now, what is it that you want?

152
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,830
LILLY (OFFSCREEN): Everything
is taken care of.

153
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,833
The home health agency comes
on Monday, and they'll make

154
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,368
sure I get everything I need.

155
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,405
-Ma, can you at least
think about it?

156
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,442
-I'm sorry, but I don't
think any of us

157
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,212
want to live together.

158
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,882
-You're not mixing your meds
with alcohol, I hope.

159
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:42,854
-If you remember, I quit
drinking two years ago.

160
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,723
-Well, sometimes that stuff
is hard to kick.

161
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,926
-Not when you're dying.

162
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,260
-Look, I don't want to fight.

163
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,995
I just want you to know
that you're welcome to

164
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,431
come live with me.

165
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,766
-Tempting.

166
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,206
I do appreciate the
offer though.

167
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,540
Thank you.

[groans]

169
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,412
-What is it?

170
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,013
-I'm fine.

171
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,582
I'm just a little tired.

172
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,788
I think I'll turn in.

173
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,524
-Do you need some help?

174
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,859
-I wouldn't mind.

175
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,115
-What?

176
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,917
-Weren't you just in college?

177
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,655
-I wish I was still
in college.

178
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,393
-Growing us doesn't
agree with you?

179
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,665
-That's something we don't
have a choice over.

180
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,137
-You have more choices
than you think.

181
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,909
Don't forget that.

182
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:15,046
-Elliot, she's playing
you like a fiddle.

183
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,815
I told you we can't give
her any option.

184
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,550
-I don't think we can
take her anywhere.

185
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,518
I mean look at her.

186
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,853
She--

187
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,934
-So why did you call my kids?

188
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,137
-You don't want them here?

189
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:45,743
-No, I don't want them
to see me like this.

190
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:49,180
That's why I didn't call them.

191
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:54,752
-Well, what about all those
talks about second chances?

192
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,988
This is an opportunity.

193
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,556
-I will not be manipulated.

194
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:09,300
-Lilly, you know I think the
world of you, but I'm afraid

195
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,303
to leave the house in case
something happens to you.

196
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,543
This is not my job.

197
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:19,877
You need help here.

198
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:29,153
-So you're leaving?

199
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,688
-I think it's best.

200
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,760
I mean now that your
kids are here--

201
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,097
-Don't leave me alone
with them.

202
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,065
-Lilly, they don't
want me here.

203
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,600
-I want you here.

204
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,905
Just until they leave.

205
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,145
Can you promise me that?

206
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,427
-What on earth are you doing?

207
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,562
-Smoking pot.

208
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,232
It's amazing.

209
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,702
-Honestly, I don't even
know where to begin.

210
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,637
-It's not that deep.

211
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,839
-No, of course not.

212
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,379
-Ted, could I have a
word with my kids?

213
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,714
-No problem.

214
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,627
LAURA (OFFSCREEN):
This is crazy.

215
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,897
You know that, right?

216
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,965
-You know what's crazy, Laura?

217
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,867
LAURA (OFFSCREEN):
What's that?

218
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,969
-That we don't have a
relationship, you

219
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:56,874
and I. Any of us.

220
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:06,284
And that's my fault, and
I apologize for that.

221
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:10,721
I brought a lot of bullshit into
this house, but the fact

222
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:14,459
remains, I'm lonely.

223
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,794
So what if Ted lives here.

224
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,597
He's a nice guy.

225
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,100
And you should be happy
someone's cooking your mother

226
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,901
dinner every night.

227
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,170
-Then why don't you
come with me?

228
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,673
With Jeff gone, there's
more room.

229
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,676
-Oh honey, you still
don't get it.

230
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,015
This is the end of the road.

231
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,550
-What does that mean?

232
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,799
-I'm gonna make some tea.

233
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,169
-Chamomile would be lovely.

234
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,470
-Sure.

235
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,181
-She's not doing well.

236
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,452
-So I'm gathering.

237
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:15,786
-I'm sorry.

238
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,159
-I just--

239
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:25,630
how did it get to this?

240
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,532
-Are you scared?

241
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,400
-I was.

242
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,735
-Not anymore?

243
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,809
-I remember when
you were a kid.

244
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,549
We signed you up for
swimming lessons.

245
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,419
Then when we got there, you
saw that some of the other

246
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,689
kids could swim better
than you.

247
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,424
That was it.

248
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,893
You were done.

249
00:19:55,895 --> 00:20:00,498
If you couldn't win, you
didn't want to play.

250
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,270
-Any other fun little childhood
stories you want to

251
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:11,008
-That's my fear for you, that
you never try anything out of

252
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,276
your comfort zone.

253
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,445
-I do plenty outside
of my comfort zone.

254
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,983
-Good, but next time an
opportunity comes up, throw

255
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,651
yourself into it.

256
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:26,190
See what happens, OK?

257
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:31,195
-Sure, but can I tell
you something?

258
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:35,066
I remember you forcing me to
take swimming lessons so I

259
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,034
wouldn't be in your way.

260
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,404
That's how I remember it.

261
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,340
-That's not true.

262
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,741
-No?

263
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,178
Does this ring a bell?

264
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,680
"You're taking swimming lessons
so I can get you out

265
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,751
of my hair for an afternoon."
That's what you said.

266
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,494
-That's pretty shitty.

267
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,363
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,499
-You didn't give a shit about
anything but your fucking

269
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:14,038
flowers, and now you want to act
like mother of the year?

270
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,640
I don't buy it.

271
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,047
-Sometimes it takes something
big to make you see how you

272
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,916
screwed things up.

273
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:31,489
I can't change that,
but I am sorry.

274
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,893
-Hello, Dr. Klein,
this is Laura

275
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,863
Garcia, Lilly's daughter.

276
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,899
I've been sort of broadsided by
my mother's condition, and

277
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:46,270
I was hoping to get a clearer
picture of what's going on.

278
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,407
I know It's not business hours,
but if you get this

279
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,343
message, I would greatly
appreciate a call back.

280
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,453
-Is she asleep?

281
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,555
-Yeah.

282
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,425
-This is definitely in the
running to be one of the

283
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,759
longest days ever.

284
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:19,637
-Elliot, what am I gonna do?

285
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,772
-Let's go for a swim.

286
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,753
-Hello.

287
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,288
-Hey.

288
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,992
Listen, um, I wanted to
apologize to you for how I

289
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,695
acted earlier.

290
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,596
-Thank you.

291
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,931
I appreciate that.

292
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,503
If this is weird, I can--

293
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,838
I'm just--

294
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,972
I'm really tired.

295
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,508
I was gonna go to
sleep anyway.

296
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,843
Good night, guys.

297
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,490
-You have a pretty
sweet deal here.

298
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:13,824
-I do.

299
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,130
It's been amazing living
in this house.

300
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,664
-I have no doubt.

301
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,835
What are you gonna do when--

302
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,370
-I'll figure something out.

303
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,210
How are you doing
with all this?

304
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,745
-Good as I can, I guess.

305
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,184
TED (OFFSCREEN): Your mom
is a good person.

306
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:45,222
-Yeah, well, she wasn't always
a pot-smoking cancer victim.

307
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,458
-She told me she was
a bad mother.

308
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,029
How bad?

309
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,798
-Just stupid stuff, you know?

310
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,751
I used to do this every
night growing up.

311
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,186
-I thought you grew
up in Manhattan.

312
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,688
-I moved to Manhattan
when I was 17.

313
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,523
My dad lived there.

314
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,659
Mom always loved it here.

315
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,327
-I can see why.

316
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,435
-Is there any booze
in the house?

317
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,672
-Why did your dad hate
your mother?

318
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:40,344
-Um, he wanted to bang every
woman he could get his hands

319
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:44,882
on, and when my mom did,
she was a whore.

320
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,884
-Wow.

321
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:47,918
-She didn't get mad.

322
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,453
She got even.

323
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,705
-Do you like what you
do in New York?

324
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,440
-No.

325
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:12,543
My sister and I run a chain
of laundromats.

326
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,712
It's the family business.

327
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,546
-I know.

328
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:18,215
Lilly told me.

329
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,284
-She did?

330
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,820
-She told me all
about you guys.

331
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:23,521
-Oh yeah?

332
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,422
Like what?

333
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:29,460
-Like you have had a series
of failed relationships.

334
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,564
-She said that?

335
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,899
-It isn't true?

336
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,869
-I think I've had great
relationships.

337
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,316
-You're very handsome.

338
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,453
-Thanks.

339
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,225
-I mean it.

340
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,833
-What are you doing?

341
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,973
-Sorry.

342
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,576
Uh, it's been a while.

343
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,310
-No, it's cool.

344
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:20,611
It's just--

345
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,018
I should probably
get some sleep.

346
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,553
Good night.

347
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,562
-Night.

348
00:26:53,578 --> 00:27:03,787
[sighs]

349
00:27:03,789 --> 00:28:17,394
[sighs]

350
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:20,330
-I think this may have been
a poor choice on my part.

351
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:28,072
-Wow, I can't believe you
just said that out loud.

352
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:32,643
-No, I don't mean that.

353
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:39,349
I just mean with my mom in
the other room dying.

354
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:44,455
It just seems like an iffy
decision at best.

355
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:49,827
-Honestly, I think she wanted
this to happen.

356
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,599
-Oh man.

357
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,509
-You OK?

358
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,481
-Yeah.

359
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,593
-Your mom told me about
Senator Adams.

360
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,664
-I don't want to talk
about that.

361
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,803
-Did you know him?

362
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,338
-I don't know anything
about it.

363
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,643
-I didn't mean to pry.

364
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,591
-Who's the guy in the photo?

365
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,130
-That's Eric.

366
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,269
-OK.

367
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,307
-He's not here.

368
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,020
-But that leads me to that
lovely pine cone art piece

369
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,855
over there.

370
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:25,856
Thoughts?

371
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,058
Excuses?

372
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,861
-Your mom made that.

373
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,430
-You lie.

374
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,765
-Nope.

375
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,903
Open it.

376
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,346
She was pissed.

377
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,951
-She loves her orchids.

378
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,769
-You travel with your own bow?

379
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,638
-No, I found it in
your garage.

380
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,172
I think it's your dad's.

381
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,498
A few months ago, I couldn't
even hit the target.

382
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,036
Come on.

383
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,371
Give it a try.

384
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,507
OK, right there.

385
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,380
Here you go.

386
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,915
This is an arrow.

387
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,787
OK.

388
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,188
So you straighten your arm.

389
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,190
Make sure your feet are apart.

390
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,458
Then you pull this back.

391
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,830
Is this how they teach archery
where you're from?

392
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,365
-Pay attention.

393
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,469
OK.

394
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,804
Draw it back.

395
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,841
Yeah, a little further.

396
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:01,044
OK, now focus on the bullseye.

397
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,380
And let it go.

398
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,185
-Well, that was fun.

399
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,456
-Ma?

400
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,860
Ma?

401
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,397
-[screams]

402
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,867
Is something wrong?

403
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,437
-No, nothing's wrong.

404
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:31,241
-What the fuck is
wrong with you?

405
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,350
-Hey.

406
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,685
-Morning.

407
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,088
-What are you doing?

408
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,858
-I'm making my famous
cranberry pancakes.

409
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,592
-Sounds good.

410
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,726
Can I help?

411
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,427
-No.

412
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:51,728
Sit back.

413
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,697
Be prepared to get
your mind blown.

414
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,799
-I can do that.

415
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,942
-Should we have eggs too?

416
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,311
-Yeah, I don't care.

417
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,481
-In that case, there's fresh
parsley in the greenhouse.

418
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,816
I'll be right back.

419
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,856
-Well, it sure looks like
you're on vacation.

420
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,959
-What does that mean?

421
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,694
-You sleep with him?

422
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,229
-Why would you ask that?

423
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,200
-You did.

424
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,402
That is so fucked up.

425
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,974
I can't even look at you.

426
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,943
-At least you're not judging.

427
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,144
-Oh no, I am judging.

428
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,547
-Yeah, what's new.

429
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:46,817
-Nothing, apparently.

430
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:48,485
Look, what is this need
for you to have

431
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,853
a man at all times?

432
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,524
It's sad.

433
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,938
-Elliot, I wish I knew
you could cook.

434
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,607
I would have put you to
work a long time ago.

435
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,811
-I've cooked for you more
than a few times.

436
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,346
-You have?

437
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,491
Well, I'm sure it was amazing.

438
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,563
-I'll be happy to make
dinner if you want.

439
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:37,167
-That would be lovely.

440
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,136
I was thinking that maybe
we could go on a

441
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,670
little outing today.

442
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,076
-Obviously.

443
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,978
I'm the one suggesting it.

444
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,046
-What did you have in mind?

445
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:55,919
-Oh, just sit on the ground,
get a little fresh air.

446
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,288
Ted, I hope you can join us.

447
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,556
TED (OFFSCREEN): That
sounds like fun.

448
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:00,357
Thank you.

449
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,691
Terrific.

450
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,564
-That's it, honey, hit
every bump you can.

451
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,698
-I'm not doing it on purpose.

452
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,499
You know that.

453
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,400
-I know.

454
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,569
It just feels like it.

455
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,904
Jesus Christ.

456
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,338
-There you go.

457
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,574
Now, that's more like the
mother I grew up with.

458
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,808
-Ow.

459
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,777
I never get sick of this.

460
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,748
-Ma.

461
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,484
-What?

462
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,451
I'm already dying.

463
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,389
-Nice.

464
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,724
-Honestly, it helps
with the pain.

465
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,430
-No, thank you.

466
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,733
Have you ever smoked
pot before?

467
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:47,204
-She was baked for about
seven years.

468
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,306
-Yeah, and then I grew up.

469
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:52,809
-Growing up ain't all it's
cracked up to be.

470
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,344
-Apparently.

471
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:03,587
[muttering]

472
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:16,600
-[chuckles]

473
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,601
-Whoa.

474
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,437
What was in that shit?

475
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:24,140
I'm ready to grow into a ball.

476
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:27,677
-Did you buy this house
or build it?

477
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,612
-Oh, Jesus.

478
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,512
-God.

479
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,947
-What?

480
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,117
-We bought this property with
another house on it.

481
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,189
It was somewhat of a historical
landmark in town,

482
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:41,558
and we had it torn down.

483
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,892
It was before they had city

484
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,995
ordinances protecting landmarks.

485
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,930
-Oh my god.

486
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,098
-I know.

487
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,167
I was so pompous.

488
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,703
I grew up with nothing,
and I valued nothing.

489
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:58,808
And my husband, he just wanted
to spend money to show what a

490
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,278
success he was.

491
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,647
That's just one of those
things that if I

492
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,181
could just do over.

493
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,789
Laura, do you still sing?

494
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,824
-No, no, not really.

495
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,259
TED (OFFSCREEN): You sing?

496
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,395
-Used to.

497
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,130
ELLIOT (OFFSCREEN):
She was good.

498
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,801
Remember that play in college?

499
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,336
-That was a highlight for me.

500
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,241
-Really?

501
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:33,943
-Of course.

502
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,979
-You never said anything.

503
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:39,316
-I didn't?

504
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,650
I should have.

505
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,359
Hey, could you boys
do me a favor.

506
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:52,629
Could you go find
me some rocks?

507
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,067
-Excuse me?

508
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,836
-I'm making something,
and I need some small

509
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,672
rocks, pretty ones.

510
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,708
-How big is small?

511
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,444
-No bigger than my nail.

512
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:11,414
And I need three to nine.

513
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,482
-Three to nine?

514
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,051
Why not nine?

515
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:19,422
-I'm not quite sure what
I'm doing with them.

516
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:20,757
I'm stoned.

517
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,398
-All right.

518
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,204
-Come up here.

519
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,816
So what happened?

520
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:52,856
-Are you OK?

521
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,958
-What do you mean?

522
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,161
-Ever since breakfast,
you've been on edge.

523
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,131
-My sister knows we
slept together.

524
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,368
-So?

525
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,772
-So she thought it was
in poor taste.

526
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,306
-Fuck her.

527
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,918
Do you think it was
in poor taste?

528
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,453
-Kind of.

529
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,256
-Really?

530
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:31,761
-Ted, you honestly don't think
it was kind of low?

531
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:36,132
-No, I don't.

532
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,500
And I wasn't joking
last night.

533
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:40,637
I think your mom would
applaud this.

534
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,674
-There's no this.

535
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:47,877
There's last night.

536
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:50,847
-And this morning.

537
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,550
But we don't have
to do it again.

538
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:54,884
See?

539
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,419
Problem solved.

540
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,730
What are we looking for?

541
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,805
-Pine cones?

542
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,407
-You have no idea
what happened?

543
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:20,844
So how can you just assume
I'm to blame?

544
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,912
-I never said that.

545
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,447
-Then what did you say?

546
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,621
-We all have a part in
everything that happens to us.

547
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:36,192
Own that, and then call Jeffrey
up and apologize for

548
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,195
what you brought to the table.

549
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,631
That'd really freak him out.

550
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:44,501
-Yeah, I bet it would

551
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,503
-There's no shame in saying
that you were wrong.

552
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:47,604
-Why am I wrong?

553
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:48,471
What about him?

554
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,474
-You're both wrong.

555
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,677
Why are you so hung
up on being right.

556
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,445
-Yeah, I just--

557
00:41:55,447 --> 00:42:00,416
I feel like I can't
talk to you.

558
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:04,621
I feel like this is the first
time we've ever spoken.

559
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,155
-But we're not talking.

560
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:09,325
You're just spouting out all of
this New Age mumbo jumbo.

561
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,428
-Well, I've become a little
clearer on a few

562
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,198
things these days.

563
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,768
-No, you've replaced booze with
pot, and now you think

564
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,803
you're Hare Krishna.

565
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,207
-Laura, you have what
I never had.

566
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,677
Don't be too quick
to let that go.

567
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,823
If I had known it would have all
come down to this, I would

568
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,892
have had the whole
place paved.

569
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,628
-No, you wouldn't have.

570
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,163
-That's what you think.

571
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,179
-Hey.

572
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,452
-What are these?

573
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,853
-Pine cones.

574
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,590
-I asked for rocks.

575
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,458
I thought you said pine cones.

576
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,860
-What am I supposed
to do with these?

577
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,438
Make sure you handle the
funeral arrangements.

578
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,675
Stupid.

579
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,015
ELLIOT (OFFSCREEN): So what do
you want for the funeral?

580
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:41,150
-Nothing, really.

581
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:45,588
I want to be cremated, and then
maybe scatter my ashes in

582
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,091
the back garden.

583
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,727
I don't think a big service
is necessary.

584
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:54,464
I doubt anybody would
come anyway.

585
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,766
-Don't say that.

586
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,669
-It's true.

587
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:03,439
Ted's my only friend, and
he doesn't even know it.

588
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,475
-No, he likes you.

589
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,377
-It doesn't matter.

590
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:11,080
You can't sweat the
small stuff.

591
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,482
Words to live by.

592
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,717
-The good news is, you're
not dead yet.

593
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,424
-I'm gonna get some produce
from the greenhouse.

594
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:25,161
-No, but could you
do me a favor?

595
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,930
Get me an orchid from the
small greenhouse.

596
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,832
I want to put it by my bed.

597
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:30,967
-Sure.

598
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,970
Any color in particular?

599
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,505
-Something beautiful.

600
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,310
-Elliot, you're cooking.

601
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,880
Why don't you go pick out
what produce you want.

602
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,861
Your brother seems
a little lost.

603
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,831
-Yeah, we're all
a little lost.

604
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,333
-Well, that's your fault.

605
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:07,537
-This has been a crazy couple
days, you know?

606
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,276
-Yeah?

607
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:20,283
-And I don't think last
night was a bad thing.

608
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,617
-OK.

609
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,538
-I just a message from
Ma's doctor.

610
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,607
-Yeah?

611
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,042
-It's really bad.

612
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:23,112
I think that we need to get her
back to New York and see

613
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,447
if anything can be done.

614
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,151
-Where have you been
the last few days?

615
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:31,053
We can't make her do it.

616
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,889
-Can we at least agree to try?

617
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,427
-Sure.

618
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,331
Good.

619
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,239
-Elliot, you've outdone
yourself.

620
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,340
-Uh-huh.

621
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,675
-For real.

622
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,180
LILLY (OFFSCREEN): Your dad
could cook, you know.

623
00:46:57,182 --> 00:47:02,084
He had all of these recipes
from Puerto Rico.

624
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:05,388
It's a shame he stopped.

625
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,559
-Well, Elliot sure didn't
get it from you.

626
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:11,928
-No, he didn't.

627
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,096
-I want to get back
to this afternoon.

628
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:17,667
I want to hear you sing.

629
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:18,901
-I don't think so.

630
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,736
-Honey, that would
be wonderful.

631
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,275
-Mom, I don't want to.

632
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,244
-I may never get the
chance again.

633
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,783
-Oh, come on.

634
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,555
-OK.

635
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,857
Let me see.

636
00:47:52,536 --> 00:48:02,345
(SINGING) Like a flower in the
sun, like a peaceful Saturday.

637
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:09,118
Like a moon shining bright, you
can take my breath away.

638
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:21,597
I'll sing your love found within
your arms, wanting so

639
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,870
much to know who you are.

640
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:35,778
So show me and tell me.

641
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,713
Open up your soul.

642
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:43,419
I'll make it easy to
give it all my

643
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,889
love, your entire heart.

644
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:56,432
All I am is all that you are.

645
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,807
[clapping]

646
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,279
-Mom?

647
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,681
What's wrong?

648
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,215
-Mom?

649
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,120
-That made my night.

650
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,425
Thank you.

651
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,199
You should sing.

652
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:34,370
That's all I'm going to say.

653
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:36,205
-I second that.

654
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:40,977
-Yeah, I'll get cracking on that
as soon as I get back to

655
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,244
the city.

656
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,213
-That is a very non-committal
response.

657
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:46,515
-I think that's what they
call a brush off.

658
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,617
-I think you're right.

659
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,962
-You'll take care of this
place, won't you?

660
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,998
-What do you mean?

661
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,532
-This is yours.

662
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,240
-What about Laura?

663
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:14,810
-She'll get the beach house.

664
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,345
She loves it there.

665
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,351
This place was always
more you.

666
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,028
-Do you play an instrument?

667
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,562
-Piano, some.

668
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,704
-I took piano lessons
for three years.

669
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,339
I sucked.

670
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:47,076
-I'm sure you weren't
that bad.

671
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,444
-I'm not being self-deprecating.

672
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,347
God never intended for
me to be a pianist.

673
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:55,384
-And what did God intend
for you then?

674
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,888
-I should have been a drummer.

675
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,790
My mom wouldn't let me.

676
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,091
-Well, you can still
play drums.

677
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:03,726
You're not even 30 years old.

678
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,261
Just take lessons.

679
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:12,802
-You get back to singing, and
I'll take drum lessons.

680
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,336
How's that?

681
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:17,706
-Ted, chances are, you and I
are never going to see each

682
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,609
other again, so I wouldn't
wait on me for anything.

683
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:27,283
-OK, this is amazing.

684
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:28,617
-It is.

685
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:39,662
-So Mom, Elliot and I were
talking, and maybe you can

686
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:42,198
come home with me and see
some specialists.

687
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,568
One last ditch effort,
you know?

688
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:49,205
-I thought we already
talked about this.

689
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,874
-I just want to make sure we
look into every possibility.

690
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:57,913
-And you think I haven't?

691
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:58,814
-I'm just saying that--

692
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:01,750
-What do you know?

693
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:04,253
You haven't been here.

694
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:13,062
I've done chemo, yoga, Tai Chi
and every other useless thing

695
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:14,597
that's out there.

696
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:21,670
Don't you dare insinuate that
I haven't looked into every

697
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:24,340
way out of this.

698
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:29,512
-I'm just worried about
being there for you.

699
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:32,148
We have a business to run.

700
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,451
We should be home.

701
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,785
-Then go.

702
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,195
-Elliot, do you want
to help out here?

703
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:59,542
-Ma, Laura wants you to
do what she wants,

704
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:02,611
not what you want.

705
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,146
So think about that.

706
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,854
How's that?

707
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,171
-What was that all about?

708
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,757
-Hey.

709
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,227
-I don't know why you would
say something like that.

710
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,928
-Maybe the same reason
you would--

711
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,430
-All I asked for was support.

712
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:55,497
Is it that hard?

713
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,299
-She doesn't want to go.

714
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:58,434
Do you want to drag your home?

715
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:00,603
I mean what is it
that you want?

716
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:03,105
-Elliot, there comes a time
when you have to do the

717
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:06,875
responsible thing, not what you
feel like but what makes

718
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,644
more sense as an adult.

719
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:09,878
-This again.

720
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,548
I'm not your little
brother anymore.

721
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,317
-There's 10 years between us.

722
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,987
You'll always be my
little brother.

723
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,622
-I'm not a child.

724
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:23,058
-Well, when you start making
adult decisions, then you

725
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,427
won't get treated like one.

726
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,163
-Well, how's this for
an adult decision.

727
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:29,932
-Oh, it's that easy, is it?

728
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,200
-It is that easy.

729
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:32,868
Dad never wanted me there
to begin with.

730
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,004
He wanted you to run it.

731
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:36,238
-Elliot, that's not--

732
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,406
-You got what you
wanted, Laura.

733
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,574
You got the whole thing
to yourself.

734
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:40,109
-I never wanted that.

735
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,176
-Well, you got it, and I don't
care if you run the whole

736
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,645
fucking thing into the ground.

737
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,446
And that's how easy this is.

738
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,815
You start fucking some stoner,
and all of a sudden you're

739
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:47,916
this free spirit?

740
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,752
-What are you two
arguing about?

741
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,790
-Elliot here just quit
the business.

742
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,292
-Are you serious?

743
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,732
-Yeah.

744
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,267
-Good for you.

745
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,738
What are you gonna do.

746
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,975
-I don't know.

747
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:18,580
-Whatever it is, I hope
it's something fun.

748
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,115
-Me too, Ma.

749
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:32,094
-Oh, Laura, you should
be happy for him.

750
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,095
He hated that job.

751
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,563
-But that was daddy's dream.

752
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:38,734
-It wasn't Elliot's dream,
or yours for that matter.

753
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:39,702
-So, what?

754
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:40,402
We just throw it all way?

755
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:44,506
Do you know how much money
you could get for it?

756
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,708
Sell it.

757
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,975
Go on an adventure.

758
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:49,511
Don't waste another second
of your life on

759
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,347
someone else's dream.

760
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,782
-That's easy to say when
you've never had one.

761
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:57,152
-I've got news for you, Laura.

762
00:55:57,154 --> 00:56:00,255
Laundry wasn't your
father's dream.

763
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:07,830
And look where it got him,
a heart attack at 55.

764
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:11,900
Oh honey, you can't take
any of it with you.

765
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:14,169
It's all just things.

766
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:19,775
And in the end, we all leave
just the same way we came in,

767
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:21,310
naked and alone.

768
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,852
-Who's feeding you all
this bullshit?

769
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:34,590
-Honey, I lost the
love of my life.

770
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:36,024
You don't have to.

771
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:39,962
-You should have told daddy
that while he was alive.

772
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,463
-I didn't mean your father.

773
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,273
-Mom?

774
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,809
-Yeah, I--

775
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:55,844
I think I'll just
get back to bed.

776
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,580
You mind giving me a push?

777
00:56:58,582 --> 00:56:59,915
-Yeah?

778
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:04,953
-Are you OK?

779
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,321
-Ted, would you mind taking
her to her room?

780
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:07,523
I'm gonna go get her
a pain pill.

781
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:09,124
-Sure.

782
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,459
-Thanks.

783
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,297
-OK.

784
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:18,300
Maybe you should think about
going home with Laura.

785
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,707
-And maybe you should start
figuring out what's next.

786
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,316
-Maybe I should.

787
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,762
-Did you get what you needed?

788
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,545
-You need anything--

789
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,080
-Thanks.

790
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,113
-Mom, why didn't you call us?

791
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,420
-I thought it was too late.

792
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,478
-How are you doing?

793
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,417
-I'm good.

794
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,233
-What are you looking at?

795
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,739
-No one ever pays attention
to this side of the house.

796
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,317
-It's a driveway.

797
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,651
-It's a garden.

798
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,160
-I guess it is.

799
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,438
I'm gonna clear the table.

800
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:15,410
-I'll give you a hand.

801
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,752
-We're not done, you and me.

802
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:25,087
-OK.

803
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,422
-Why would you pick this
night of all night

804
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:28,390
to pull this shit.

805
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:29,591
-Elliott--

806
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:30,225
-You--

807
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:34,029
And when you can't,
you freak out.

808
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:36,465
-Well, someone has to at least
try and take control.

809
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:40,869
-Of a situation you can't
possibly control.

810
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,437
I have news for you.

811
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:47,042
Ma is gonna die any day, and
there's nothing any of us can

812
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:49,411
do about it.

813
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:54,750
In the meantime, you'll just
fuck Ted and make pancakes?

814
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:56,318
-Fuck you, Laura.

815
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,119
-I know.

816
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:59,087
I'm the asshole.

817
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,455
But who do you think takes
care of all the

818
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:01,690
details around here?

819
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:04,226
-You, Laura, out of guilt.

820
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:05,794
You don't give a
shit about Ma.

821
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,664
You just want to rush in and
save the day so everyone will

822
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,265
what a good daughter you are.

823
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:10,866
-Oh, really?

824
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,401
-Really.

825
01:01:12,403 --> 01:01:14,236
And all of this talk about
responsibility, where have you

826
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:15,837
been this past year
and a half?

827
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,408
-Same place as you, Elliot, or
am I at fault because I didn't

828
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,744
pack your bags and
drive you here?

829
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:26,014
That's why you're a child,
Elliot, because you wait for

830
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,316
everyone else to take
care of you.

831
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:29,985
Have you even thought about
the fact that we

832
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:32,320
have to plan a funeral?

833
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:35,657
No, why would you when you know
someone else is going to

834
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:37,159
do it for you.

835
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,161
And why can't you be alone?

836
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:42,230
You're the neediest
person I ever met.

837
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:45,634
So don't tell me that you're
not a child, Elliot.

838
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:47,903
That's exactly what you are.

839
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,938
-You got all the answers,
don't you?

840
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,406
-I got a few.

841
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,842
Your husband left you.

842
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:56,745
Why is that?

843
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:58,647
Think about it.

844
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:00,849
-Hey.

845
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:04,986
Look, this is none of
my business, but

846
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:06,488
think about your mom.

847
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,256
-You're right, Ted.

848
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,292
This is none of your business.

849
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:12,694
-Just-- she can hear you guys.

850
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:15,063
-Why are you still here?

851
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,132
-Don't turn this on me.

852
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,168
-No, what normal person
stays in a house

853
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,204
while someone is dying?

854
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:24,539
Out of respect for our family,
you should have left the

855
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,141
minute that we came here.

856
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:29,344
-Your mom asked me to stay so
she wouldn't have to be alone

857
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:30,479
with you two.

858
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,147
And I completely get it.

859
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:34,049
You both have made this whole
thing about you every chance

860
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:35,517
you've got.

861
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,987
Now, I didn't know your mom back
then, but right now, she

862
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,555
is in there dying.

863
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:43,859
And you, Laura, argue nonstop
with everyone in this house.

864
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,160
It's insane.

865
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:47,963
-And you got it all together,
is that it?

866
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,098
Keeping a framed photo
of your ex-boyfriend

867
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,767
who fucked you over?

868
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,402
Spare us the lecture.

869
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:55,971
-You don't know anything
about that.

870
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:56,805
-I know.

871
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:57,906
You're so complex.

872
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:01,576
I could never figure you out.

873
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,745
-Your sister was right.

874
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:05,280
You are a fucking child.

875
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,529
What do you want, Elliot?

876
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,802
-I'm sorry for what I said.

877
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:36,304
It was stupid.

878
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:37,639
-It was.

879
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,410
-Yeah, well I'm sorry.

880
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,430
LAURA (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
did I wake you?

881
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:03,765
Sorry.

882
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,803
Look, I just wanted to, um, to
say to you that I've been

883
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:11,239
thinking a lot about us.

884
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,743
And, um, I want to apologize
for all the

885
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:18,246
stupid shit that I did.

886
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:21,116
I just--

887
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:23,985
I know I can be a bitch,
and I never

888
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:27,188
wanted to be that person.

889
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,358
You deserve more than
that, so I'm sorry.

890
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,897
No, I'm not drunk.

891
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,746
-What are you doing?

892
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,790
-I was kind of hoping
that maybe I could

893
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,960
stay with you tonight.

894
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:08,163
-Are you serious?

895
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:09,497
-Yeah.

896
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,909
-Elliot, this is getting
kind of weird.

897
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:25,246
-I think it was weird
before I got here.

898
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:26,982
You don't have to do anything.

899
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:30,552
I just want to--

900
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:31,886
stay with you.

901
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,118
-Ow, ow.

902
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,200
I'm gonna call 911.

903
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,770
No?

904
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,304
Mom, I think that--

905
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,841
OK.

906
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:28,543
Can I get you anything?

907
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,150
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do.

908
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:47,762
-When you sang tonight,
I saw you.

909
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,531
-Oh yeah?

910
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:50,865
-You're so beautiful.

911
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,747
-Why are you living here?

912
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:13,855
-I guess I checked
out for a while.

913
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:15,590
It's been nice.

914
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,806
-What happened?

915
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,776
-What do you mean?

916
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,311
-With Eric.

917
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,014
I don't know.

918
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:41,850
You live in a house
with a dying woman

919
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:44,519
who's twice your age.

920
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:45,854
What is that about?

921
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,492
And you don't have
to talk about it.

922
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:57,932
But isn't it hard being around
someone who's dying?

923
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:00,602
-That's nothing.

924
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:03,505
I rented a room from a woman
who had her legs

925
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:06,207
blown off in Iraq.

926
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,176
She had to walk on her hands.

927
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:14,082
-Like the woman in your book?

928
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,264
Is that with this is?

929
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,469
Is it?

930
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,415
I don't know what
to do with that.

931
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,655
-With what?

932
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,723
Honesty?

933
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:59,194
-You're just using us.

934
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,129
-That is not how I look at it.

935
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,931
-How do you look at it?

936
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:07,569
-Elliot, your mom was so
lonely when I met her.

937
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:10,138
-You just want to know how the
great Ralph Adams lost his

938
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,874
political career.

939
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:17,879
-At first, but I told
her months ago.

940
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:18,947
She's cool with it.

941
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:20,381
-So you're not a
groundskeeper?

942
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:24,752
-I try.

943
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:29,824
Look, what is the difference
between right now and

944
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:32,126
half an hour ago?

945
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:35,196
-You lied your way
into this house.

946
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:37,532
And just because you think
my mom is cool

947
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:38,733
doesn't make it OK.

948
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,301
-That's a bit dramatic.

949
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:41,769
-Is it?

950
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:44,672
-Elliot, when I got here, your
mom was desperate for

951
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:49,777
attention, and she has so
many great stories.

952
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,214
And your whole family
is so fucked up.

953
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:55,183
I mean the book wrote itself.

954
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,355
-Who's Eric?

955
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,326
-My boyfriend.

956
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,964
Five years now.

957
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,066
It's open.

958
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:13,601
He knows everything.

959
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,207
-Am I in your book?

960
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,387
That went in too.

961
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,925
-No.

962
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,460
-What am I then?

963
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,731
-I haven't figured
that out yet.

964
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,503
-Honesty, huh?

965
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,252
-Ma?

966
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:52,400
[knocking]

967
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:54,235
-I can't find Ma.

968
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,143
-I know where she is.

969
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,315
I'll go in this one.

970
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,758
Ma?

971
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,292
Ma?

972
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,765
-[gasps].

973
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,299
Elliot?

974
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,228
She's so cold.

975
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,770
-How long have you been here?

976
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,243
Are you OK?

977
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,283
Elliot?

978
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,131
-Hey.

979
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:29,437
Our mother left this for you.

980
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:30,771
-Thank you.

981
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,444
-I know this hasn't been easy.

982
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:43,317
She considered you a friend,
so thank you for that.

983
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,439
-Well done, grasshopper.

984
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:14,482
Your sister just gave me this.

985
01:19:14,484 --> 01:19:16,183
-What does it say?

986
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,289
-Break up with Eric.

987
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:29,263
-Did you?

988
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,598
-No.

989
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:44,211
Hey, are we cool?

990
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:46,113
-I haven't figured
that out yet.

991
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,452
Fair enough.

992
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,659
-We should get going.

993
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,194
-Let me get my bag.

994
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,780
-Jeff?

995
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:25,412
-I came as soon as I heard.

996
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:27,081
-How did you know?

997
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:30,484
-Elliot called me
this morning.

998
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:33,621
What's up, scrub?

999
01:21:33,623 --> 01:21:35,155
-Not much.

1000
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,759
-Let's get you home.

1001
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:48,402
Drive safe.

1002
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,737
-I will.

1003
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:43,857
-Is it weird for me to
go to the funeral?

1004
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:46,593
-I don't think anything's
weird anymore.

1005
01:22:55,837 --> 01:23:02,743
-Hey, uh, do you want
to ride with me?

1006
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,845
-No, I'll drive.

1007
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:10,217
-OK.

1008
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:13,921
NARRATOR: That last night, as
Elliott sat at her bedside,

1009
01:23:13,923 --> 01:23:15,589
Lilly told him the truth.

1010
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:17,458
And he wasn't shocked.

1011
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,260
He'd always heard the
rumors growing up.

1012
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:22,730
Fear kept her from
telling him.

1013
01:23:22,732 --> 01:23:26,333
Fear stopped him from asking,
but it's in those moments when

1014
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:30,804
we pushed through the fear we
find new opportunities, even

1015
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:32,439
when we think it's too late.
