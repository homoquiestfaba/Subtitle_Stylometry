1
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,100
Hello.

2
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,220
Breathing pretty heavy
over there.

3
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,300
Just a dream.

4
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,980
You sure you're okay?

5
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,060
Do you want me to leave
or something?

6
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,260
No, stay.
I'm gonna go get some air.

7
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,780
You know you got two
different shoes on, right?

8
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
One's a little newer
than the other.

9
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,100
Anything else?

10
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,740
Thanks for stopping by.

11
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,980
What the hell
did you just do?

12
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,180
How did you get up there?

13
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Be strong, fellows.
We going, baby. Come on.

14
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,700
One of us has to move on
some of that. Oh, yeah?

15
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,740
Well, some of us already have.
Hi, Dory.

16
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,420
Hey, Tommy. Hey, Dan!

17
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Looking good,
all right.

18
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,620
Thanks, Trev.

19
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,100
Referring to the endless array
of women, dickhead.

20
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,700
How can they all be in love
with me? Exactly, how can they?

21
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,620
Incoming, gentlemen.

22
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,300
Oh, my sweet mama and papa.

23
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,380
See that smile she gave us?
Yeah. Looked like a toothpaste ad.

24
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,260
Whitest teeth
I've ever come across.

25
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,020
Faster, faster!
Punch hard, punch hard.

26
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,740
Heel! Good!
All right, Jensen.

27
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,740
You work hard and you get
results. That's how it happens.

28
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,100
Nice, Kyle.

29
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,620
Excellent.

30
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,860
Now, who else has some good
stuff to show me today, huh?

31
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,940
All right, Millman. Nice.

32
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,300
Tight. Lower your shoulders.
Good. Keep it tight.

33
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,260
Good, good.

34
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,260
I want to show you something, Coach.
Don't waste energy. Keep that mouth shut.

35
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,340
Good.

36
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,940
Millman. Millman!

37
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,620
Sorry, Coach.

38
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,220
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

39
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,460
I can do this.

40
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,820
I've been working on it.

41
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,980
Get over here!

42
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,700
Nobody on this planet can do
what you are trying to do.

43
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,700
You are great up there, Danny.
You're one of the best I've seen.

44
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,740
You're gonna rank even higher
than you did last year,

45
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,860
and you might make it
through all the qualifiers if

46
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,820
you don't
kill yourself first.

47
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,980
Tommy, you're up.

48
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,540
What's he trying to do?

49
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,180
Three consecutive flips
before he dismounts.

50
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,980
Anybody ever done that?
Nope.

51
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,980
That's why
he's trying to do it.

52
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,380
Thinks it's gonna make him
lord of the rings.

53
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,980
Only, with Middleman, it's where he tries
to tear both arms out of their sockets.

54
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,780
All right, the next qualifying
heat is six weeks from today,

55
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,500
and you know what I say.

56
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,060
Don't think
this is gonna happen

57
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,420
just 'cause you're pretty
and can do a handstand.

58
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,660
You think I'm kidding?

59
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,300
And I've got footage of your
competition you need to see again.

60
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,300
Help you with something?

61
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,180
You can tell me
how you did it.

62
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,780
You like things explained.

63
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,580
Don't you?

64
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,060
How we doing tonight?

65
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,740
Look.

66
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,380
That roof's gotta be at
least 10, maybe 12 feet high.

67
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,900
No human can make a vertical
leap over four or five feet, tops.

68
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,580
I know. I'm a gymnast.

69
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,540
Toughest men's sport in the
world. Most people don't know that.

70
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,300
The Spartans of ancient Greece
were gymnasts, too.

71
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,380
They vaulted over bulls.

72
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,900
Trained their elite warriors
that way.

73
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,580
Did you know that?

74
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,700
I know more than you think. And
you think more than you know.

75
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,220
But knowledge is
not the same as wisdom.

76
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,340
Yeah? What's the difference?

77
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,980
You know how to clean a
windshield, right? Yeah.

78
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,740
Wisdom is doing it.

79
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,500
I train seven days a week,
50 weeks out of the year.

80
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,300
Why so much?
Are you serious?

81
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,340
I am a heartbeat away
from qualifying.

82
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,980
Qualifying for what?

83
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,300
You watch the Olympics?
No.

84
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,820
Thanks for stopping by.

85
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,660
Look, even as good as I am,

86
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,940
I gotta do everything I can
to make sure that I qualify.

87
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,580
There's a lot you'd have to know before
you could understand what you saw.

88
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,060
Go. Ask me.
Ask me something.

89
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,700
Ask me anything.

90
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,620
Are you happy?

91
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,220
You said
I could ask you anything.

92
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,420
What does happy
have to do with anything?

93
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,780
Everything.

94
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,740
My dad's got plenty of cash,

95
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,100
school's kind of a breeze,
I get straight A's.

96
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,860
I got great friends,
I'm in great shape,

97
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,860
and I only sleep alone
when I absolutely want to.

98
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,060
So why can't you
sleep at night?

99
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,300
Yesterday, you came here
at 3:00 a. m. Now, tonight.

100
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,580
That's two nights in a row.

101
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,660
What are you? Some kind of a Quickie
Mart philosopher or something like that?

102
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,820
You need some philosophy?

103
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,700
No, thanks, Socrates.
I get enough at school.

104
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,700
Last question.

105
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,780
If you don't make the Olympic
team, what will you do?

106
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,460
If I don't what?

107
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,140
You must have thought
about it.

108
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,860
What the hell
are you talking about?

109
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,620
What's the problem?

110
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,900
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

111
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,540
You're a freak. And I don't
need you freaking me out.

112
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,780
Thirteen.

113
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,460
Fourteen.

114
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,780
Your exit sign's lit, Middleman.

115
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,300
Fifteen.

116
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,620
Sixteen.

117
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,180
Hey, there, beautiful thing.
So, this is what you do for fun.

118
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,220
Seventeen.

119
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,900
Eighteen.

120
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,260
Did I pick up that maybe you and
Dory hooked up the other night?

121
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,060
Come on, Dan-o.
It's all you.

122
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,860
Nineteen.

123
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,420
She told you that?
Is it true?

124
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,660
We're supposed to be friends,
man.

125
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,100
What does
that mean, exactly?

126
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,460
It means you're a jerk who
treats his friends like dirt.

127
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,220
Somebody grab my beers.

128
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,660
Somebody grab mine!

129
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

130
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,820
Come on, guys.

131
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,780
Hey, Dan, what's the matter
with you, man?

132
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,940
With friends like you, who
needs assholes, right, Dan-o?

133
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Calm down. What? You
want to fight Tommy?

134
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,620
Who does he think he is? He's
pissed at you, all right? Is it true?

135
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,340
I thought Dory was old news.
All right?

136
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,340
So, excuse me if she
comes banging on my door.

137
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,380
Why? Why, Dan?

138
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,420
Listen to yourself.
Dory was Tommy's girl.

139
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,980
I said I thought it was over!

140
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,500
Just go back
to your party, man.

141
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,620
Okay. Yeah, I will.

142
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Hey.

143
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,140
You want these?

144
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,820
You're really cute.

145
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,740
Jesus!

146
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,180
Susie, you okay?

147
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,180
Yeah.

148
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,340
Sorry.

149
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,860
What's the matter?

150
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,540
Couldn't sleep again?

151
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,020
What would you say
if I told you

152
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,860
that I keep seeing those shoes
in a dream I keep having?

153
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,100
I'd say maybe
you're still asleep.

154
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,700
You can live a whole lifetime
without ever being awake.

155
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,180
Hey, Socrates.

156
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,420
If you know so much,

157
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,940
how come you're working
at a gas station?

158
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,580
This is a service station.
We offer service.

159
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,540
There's no higher purpose.

160
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,340
Than pumping gas?
Service to others.

161
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,500
How we doing tonight?

162
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,620
Japanese style, huh?

163
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,420
So you know Socrates?

164
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,660
Is that what you call him?

165
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
I bet he loves that.

166
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,220
You eat here with him
every night?

167
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,460
Actually,
I think one's for you.

168
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,700
I see you've met Joy.

169
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,900
Hey, big Buddha.
Hi, little Buddha.

170
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,460
Joy, this is Dan.

171
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,860
We met.

172
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,820
Socrates.
Socrates.

173
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,700
Bon appétit.

174
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,260
You look hungry.

175
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,820
Joy do all that?

176
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,260
She live around here?

177
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,580
She related to you
or something?

178
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,380
You need to start asking
better questions.

179
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,500
What?

180
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,100
Slow down.
You might taste something.

181
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,700
You sure got a lot of rules
about stuff, don't you?

182
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,780
Not rules. Things I've learned
from my own life experience.

183
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,380
That's why I'd say
your eating is sloppy.

184
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,540
Who cares?
You do.

185
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,500
That's the difference
between us, Dan.

186
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,700
You practice gymnastics.
I practice everything.

187
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,340
If I was your trainer,
no meat.

188
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,620
Seriously?
None.

189
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,500
I could probably
handle that.

190
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,460
No TV, no alcohol,
no drugs and no sex.

191
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,580
And that's why I'm glad
you're not my trainer.

192
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,660
So, this diet and your training
are making you all you can be?

193
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,260
Absolutely.

194
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,900
So, how long
can you stand like this?

195
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,100
Name it.

196
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,500
Five minutes. On the table.
Done.

197
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,220
You move so much as a muscle,

198
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,700
and I get to call you Jack
for the rest of the night.

199
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,940
Jack?
Short for jackass.

200
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,420
What time is it?

201
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,980
What time is it?

202
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,060
What time

203
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,420
is

204
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,740
it?

205
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,500
What

206
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,180
time

207
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,180
is...

208
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,380
My son, Jack.

209
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,420
Thanks for stopping by.

210
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,420
Everyone tells you what to do
and what's good for you.

211
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,860
They don't want you
to find your own answers.

212
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,100
They want you
to believe theirs.

213
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,340
And let me guess.
You want me to believe yours.

214
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,780
No.

215
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,580
I want you to stop gathering
information from outside yourself

216
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,260
and start gathering it
from the inside.

217
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,300
What are you, part of
some cult or something?

218
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,180
People are afraid
of what's inside,

219
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,620
and that's the only place they're
ever gonna find what they need.

220
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,060
Why can't you sleep?

221
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Is it because,
maybe, late at night,

222
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,300
when all the noise dies down and
you're lying there in the bed,

223
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,340
and there's nobody around but you,
then, maybe, you get a little scared?

224
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,340
Scared because suddenly
everything feels so

225
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,460
empty.

226
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,300
You tell me you want to be more than
just someone who gets up on those rings

227
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,420
and performs
a well-practiced stunt or two.

228
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,300
You tell me
you want to be someone

229
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,580
who uses his mind and his body

230
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,300
in ways that most people would
never have the courage to,

231
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,540
and I will train you, Dan,

232
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,020
to be a real warrior.

233
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,700
Is he all right?

234
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,340
What's going on?

235
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,580
Kyle. He took a bad fall.

236
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,420
It's fine. I'm fine.

237
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,180
It might be broken.
No.

238
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,700
We'll need an x-ray.
No.

239
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,980
It's all right, Kyle. It's
all right. It's all right.

240
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,780
I mean it, Coach.
I know.

241
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,940
It doesn't feel like a break.

242
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,660
They're just gonna have
a look at it, that's all.

243
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,460
I don't need it looked at.

244
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,380
And I said you did.

245
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,260
Let's go.

246
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,940
Put it in a sling.
I don't need a sling.

247
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,100
Rider down, man.
Bad break.

248
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,300
You don't know that.
It could be a sprain.

249
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,220
I mean, he's a casualty,
Tommy-boy. He's our best horse man.

250
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,300
Where do you think
that leaves us, huh?

251
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,620
Trevor, get off that thing.

252
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,420
Or what?
Like you don't want it?

253
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,580
Except you suck
at the pommel horse, Middleman.

254
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,300
I just never focused on it.

255
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,100
That's 'cause you got
one big show and only one.

256
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,580
Lord of the rings.

257
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,220
Yeah? Want to see
what I can do?

258
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,980
Don't embarrass yourself.
Go play, little boy.

259
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,220
Jesus Christ, did you both
just see them take Kyle away?

260
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,420
I mean, Jesus,
what if he's done?

261
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,700
Don't get in my face about it, all right?
Jesus, go hold his hand if you want to.

262
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,740
Sometimes,
I don't like myself very much.

263
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,140
My first thought was about how maybe
Kyle's fall could work out for me.

264
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,100
People are not their thoughts.

265
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,060
They think they are and it
brings them all kinds of sadness.

266
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,380
Toss me that wrench.

267
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm not what I think?

268
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,460
Of course not.

269
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
The five-eighths.

270
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,780
The mind is just
a reflex organ.

271
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,220
It reacts to everything.

272
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,140
Fills your head with millions
of random thoughts a day.

273
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,620
None of those thoughts
reveal any more about you

274
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,420
than a freckle does
at the end of your nose.

275
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,900
Take a swing at me.
What?

276
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,700
What are you doing?

277
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,700
Come on. 10 bucks if you
can slap me on the cheek.

278
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,620
Come on. Take a shot.

279
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,380
Knock it off, man.
I don't want to hit you.

280
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,060
You don't want to hit me?

281
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,740
I don't want to hurt you.

282
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,780
I guess I'll just have to
keep slapping you then.

283
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,820
Did you notice how the right
leverage can be very effective?

284
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,860
What if I were to tell you

285
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,700
that's what your training,
even your life, is about?

286
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,460
Developing the wisdom
to apply the right leverage

287
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,060
in the right place,
at the right time.

288
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,700
Take out the trash.
You take out the trash.

289
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,220
The trash is up here.

290
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,860
That's the first part
of your training,

291
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,140
learning to throw out everything
you don't need in here.

292
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,340
How?

293
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,300
Meet me tomorrow on campus.

294
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,100
Strawberry Creek bridge.

295
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,580
Where the hell are you going?
Poli-sci. Where are you going?

296
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,460
I'm going to pommel horse
try-outs.

297
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I forgot.

298
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,140
Less than an hour.
Hey, hey! Wait up.

299
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,820
Tell them to hold up
for me, all right? What?

300
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,460
Soc!

301
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,860
Soc!

302
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,020
Listen.
I totally forgot about this.

303
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,860
Now, I got this thing
at the gym.

304
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,700
It's pretty important.
Can we make this quick?

305
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,780
Sure.

306
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,620
Hey!

307
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,740
Hey! I'm talking to you.

308
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,620
What the hell is wrong with you?
You said you were in a hurry.

309
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,860
So you pushed me off the
bridge? I emptied your mind.

310
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,180
You what?
I emptied...

311
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,500
No, you didn't.
You threw me into the river.

312
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,900
And while you were falling, tell
me, Dan, what were you thinking of?

313
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
I don't know!

314
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,380
Were you thinking about school? No!

315
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,620
Grocery shopping?
No!

316
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,940
This thing you had to
hurry off to? No! I was...

317
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,260
The present.

318
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,140
Devoted 100% to the experience
you were having.

319
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,780
You even had a word for it.

320
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,700
You're out of your mind.
You know that?

321
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,500
It's taken
a lifetime of practice.

322
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,580
We want you
out of your mind, too, Dan.

323
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,820
What is that you do?

324
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,060
Some kind of
martial arts move?

325
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,820
I didn't see it coming.
You weren't paying attention.

326
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,780
Even now you're not.
Your mind's filling up again.

327
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,660
You're missing out
on everything that's going on.

328
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,660
There's nothing going on.

329
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,420
There's never
nothing going on.

330
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,460
Take out the trash, Dan.

331
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,700
The trash is anything that is keeping
you from the only thing that matters,

332
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,940
this moment.

333
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,700
Here.

334
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,300
Now.

335
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,460
And when you truly are
in the here and now,

336
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,820
you'll be amazed at what you can
do and how well you can do it.

337
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,380
Until we know more about Kyle,
we need the horse covered, so...

338
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,300
Anybody who wants
a shot at it, gets a shot.

339
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,740
Where's Millman?

340
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,060
All right,
next man up. Trev?

341
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,980
You know I'm superstitious,
Coach. I gotta go last.

342
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,340
I'll go.

343
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,780
All right.

344
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Millman, where the hell
did that come from?

345
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,700
Soc!

346
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,540
Hot damn! I wish you could've
been there. You would've loved it!

347
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,940
I used your trick.

348
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,820
I used your mind trick and it worked.
It totally worked. I was awesome.

349
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,260
It's not a trick. Yeah, well,
whatever it is, I used it.

350
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,460
I took out the trash,
and I mean Trev?

351
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,780
Trev's the one guy
I'm always going up against.

352
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,700
You should have seen me.
I demolished the guy.

353
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,460
You know, I wasn't worried
about what did happen,

354
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
or what might happen,
what could happen.

355
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,140
I just got up there
and I cleared my mind.

356
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,660
And I was flawless.

357
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,700
Listen, I'm jumping in
with both feet. All right?

358
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,660
Whatever you tell me to do, I'm gonna do.
No beer, no meat, no girls, no problem.

359
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,020
How long did you stay
that way, clear and flawless?

360
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,260
"I demolished that guy.
You should have seen me. "

361
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,700
You're in the past.

362
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,060
Gloating.

363
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,020
You're not in the now, living.

364
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,100
You haven't learned anything.

365
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,260
Go home.
Training's over for tonight.

366
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,620
Wait a minute.

367
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,980
Wait a minute.

368
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,140
Go home, I said.

369
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,500
Hey, Dan.

370
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,340
Why do we have to be all the way up
here, where we could kill ourselves?

371
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,300
I was hoping
you could tell me.

372
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,580
God!

373
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,460
What do I keep trying for?

374
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,540
I'll never make this cut.

375
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,260
Dad was right.

376
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,780
I'm gonna make him right if
I don't find a way to do this.

377
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Will I ever forgive myself
if I don't make this cut?

378
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,780
Where the hell is Millman?

379
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,740
Too good to show up
for practice, now, I guess.

380
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,060
I don't know how to handle these
kids. What do I say to them?

381
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,340
They're talking,
but their lips aren't moving.

382
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,860
I'm not their mother.
I'm their coach.

383
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,980
Coach thinks
I'm worthless.

384
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,020
I am worthless.

385
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,460
I'm a worthless piece of shit

386
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,900
and Millman's always
gonna be better than me.

387
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,820
Am I reading their minds?

388
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,460
Maybe you just never really
listened to them before.

389
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,100
I've only got four qualifiers
left. I've got to get new mats.

390
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,060
I can't stick this double double.
My line's not straight on the bar.

391
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm such a worthless
piece of shit.

392
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,980
You gotta be doing this.
Otherwise I'm losing my mind.

393
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,260
Sometimes you have to lose your
mind before you come to your senses.

394
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,860
Millman!

395
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,140
It's about time you showed up.

396
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,060
Thanks for joining us.

397
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,700
Go home, I said.

398
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
What did you just do to me?

399
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,300
You have to be strong
if you're gonna do this, Dan.

400
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,020
What did you do?

401
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,820
Where I'm gonna take you, some
of the things I'm gonna show you,

402
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,300
you're gonna need strength.

403
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,940
And you're gonna need
to trust me.

404
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,300
So it's hot as hell,
and this penguin,

405
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,380
he's pushing his broken-down
car past the 31 flavors.

406
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,060
So, suddenly he's practically
burying his face in a large vanilla

407
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,780
when he sees
a service station.

408
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,540
So he goes over, the mechanic
opens up the hood and says,

409
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,540
"Looks to me
like you've blown a seal. "

410
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,460
The penguin wipes his mouth and says,
"Hey, screw you! It's ice cream. "

411
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,660
What's up, Tommy?
Hey, Trev.

412
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,580
Hey, what's up with
the rabbit chow, Middleman?

413
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,140
All right, I got another one.

414
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,020
A man, a duck and a big-breasted
nun walk into a bar, right?

415
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,460
So, this old guy
did this high jump.

416
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,420
Did this really high jump.

417
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,580
And?

418
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,060
I'm kind of doing
what he tells me

419
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,260
so I can find out
how he did it.

420
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,500
Wait a minute.

421
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,260
You're letting somebody
else coach you? No.

422
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,420
Well, what's he doing to you?
'Cause you look like crap.

423
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,780
I don't know.

424
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,860
I don't know
what he's doing to me.

425
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,700
You better get away from it,
Middleman.

426
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,020
We got qualifiers in four weeks and you're
looking like a worthless piece of shit.

427
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,900
Hey!

428
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,940
Joy, right?
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,300
I need to talk to you
about our mutual friend.

430
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,180
Socrates?

431
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,620
If he didn't tell you his
name, you won't get it from me.

432
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,060
Yeah, why didn't he tell me?

433
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,540
I mean, I don't know anything
about the guy.

434
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,860
I'm serious.

435
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,380
All right? He's supposed to be making
me stronger, making my life better.

436
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,020
It's just the opposite.

437
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,940
What's he doing?

438
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,580
What are you worried about?

439
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,820
I want to know
who I'm dealing with here.

440
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,900
Come on, come on.
Tight. Keep it tight, Danny!

441
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,500
No! No, you're shaking!
You're shaking!

442
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,460
What the hell
are you doing up there?

443
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,580
Yeah, I'm off today.

444
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,020
Oh. You're off, huh?

445
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,340
Well, you've been off for
one hell of a streak, Millman.

446
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,580
First you're a dream on the horse and
now you can barely stand up straight.

447
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,700
Huh?

448
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,780
Next time you're tired, go take a
nap instead of coming to practice.

449
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,460
Ike, your key?
Yep, all right.

450
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,500
Voyeur.

451
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,820
How we doing tonight?

452
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,340
How am I doing?

453
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,860
I'm tired, I'm hungry
and I'm horny.

454
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,540
How are you doing?

455
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,340
I need some answers tonight.

456
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,780
I need to know that this...

457
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,940
That this is all going somewhere,
and I need to know it right now.

458
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,980
I mean, what kind of a warrior trains
by sitting around scrubbing toilets?

459
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,900
When you become a warrior, you
learn to meditate in every action.

460
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,820
Scrubbing toilets?
Letting go of attachments.

461
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,100
Like your pride.

462
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,660
Giving up your addictions. Yeah,
name one thing I'm addicted to.

463
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,060
Talking.
Especially interrupting.

464
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,540
Knowing everything,
when in fact you know nothing.

465
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,980
You really think that this is going
to expand my awareness of anything?

466
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,140
My game is off! My coach
probably thinks that I'm on drugs,

467
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,700
and I'm thinking...

468
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,900
I just don't have any more
time for you right now.

469
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,220
All you have is right now,
Jack.

470
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,420
Did you just call me
a jackass again?

471
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,100
'Cause, you know, I'm really starting
to wonder how someone with the life

472
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,340
that you've managed to put
together can teach me anything.

473
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,380
I mean, are you really happy?

474
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,340
Maybe you're just a case of someone
who, not having made much of themselves,

475
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,300
says that the world is lost and
all these things don't matter.

476
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,980
Be happy with less, right? Less
than what? Less than nothing?

477
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,300
I call you a jackass
when you act like a jackass.

478
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,260
Like now, Dan, when you're
letting your emotions control you.

479
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,060
This isn't emotion!
This is common sense!

480
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,220
You know what?
Let me tell you something,

481
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,420
whatever your name really is.

482
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,020
When I get what I want,
I'll be happy.

483
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,020
For real and forever and
anything else I say it'll be.

484
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,140
'Cause I will make it happen.

485
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,900
Three, two, one!

486
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,820
Drink! Drink! Drink!

487
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,260
Danny, good.

488
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,340
That's it, Danny.

489
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,540
Steady.

490
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,220
Good. All right, come on!
Bring it home!

491
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,060
That's what I remember about
you, Millman! You were good.

492
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,100
I needed this.

493
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,180
Needed to escape.

494
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,620
Lucky me.
Yeah, and lucky me.

495
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,100
You guys
are in such great shape.

496
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,260
So if I wasn't
in such great shape,

497
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,220
wasn't on the gymnastics team,
just had a regular body,

498
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,900
you wouldn't be into me?

499
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,820
If I didn't have this body,
would you be into me?

500
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,300
Hey, Middleman.

501
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,580
I don't know what to say.

502
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,900
Hey.

503
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,780
Got the whole team here.

504
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,220
You ran a red light, man.
Can you believe that?

505
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,820
You gotta get better, man,
'cause...

506
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,980
You ran a red light.

507
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,700
...whose ass
am I gonna kick at practice?

508
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,020
Don't waste your energy.
Keep that mouth shut.

509
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,340
Dan?

510
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,220
Dan?
