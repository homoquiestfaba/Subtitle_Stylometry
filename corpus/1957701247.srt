I am a Hutu

86
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,465

87
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,383
I may face the same danger.

88
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,304
We are in my home,
beneath the floor of my kitchen.

We built it ourselves.
Good for storing food.

We'll be safest here, a day or so,

[in Kinyarwanda] Where's the toilet?

99
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,058
[in English] It's almost dark.
We can sneak there.

100
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,893
No. The risk is too great.

101
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,230
Then what? Where are we supposed to pee?

102
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,981
[Mutesi sighs]

103
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,486
- We cannot. We need...
- What? What more can we need?

104
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,780
Francois will give us everything we need.

105
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,073
And it will end.

107
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,370
I'm sorry.

108

I'm sorry, I...

109
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,856
[Mutesi in Kinyarwanda] Where is it?

110

[guns firing in distance]

114
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,308
It locks from the outside.

115
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,187
[Mutesi] What does?

116
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,608
[Annick] This room.

117
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
The door.

118
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,657
Don't be afraid.

[gasps]

120
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,810
[in English] We are locked in here?

- [Mutesi grunting]
- [Annick] Mutesi.

122
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,583
- Mutesi!
- [whimpering]

123
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,711

[grunting, panting]

125
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,757
It locks when the door closes.

126
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,554
We are safe.

127
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,389
Francois says it will end quickly.

128
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,558
The UN will come.

129
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,685
Belgian troops are here.

[Mutesi breathing heavily]

131
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,024
[Annick] Think about something else.
That's what I'm doing.

132
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,943
Just until tomorrow.

133
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,946

Mutesi.

145
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,925
- [gasps]
- [Peyton] It's okay.

146
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
It's okay. It's just me.

147
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,222
Uh, I... I have an idea
for a toilet, for now,

148
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,724
but I... I need your help.

149
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,727
Um, I... I think there's,
like, a hole right here.

150
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,024
We could break it.

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,904
Wrap another time.

152
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,784
Pull.

156
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,549
- Do you...
- Uh...

157
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,426
You first.

158
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,183
- [urinating]
- [Peyton sighing]

159
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,312
I could cry right now. [sighs]

Um...

164
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,708
- Thank you.
- So Francois is your husband?

165
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,711
Five years. But we've known each other
since we were very young.

166
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,964
Almost our whole lives.
We were in primary school when he told me

167
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,551
he had claimed me. I was his.

168
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,927
[laughs]

169
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,681
It is a good thing
you've not had a child yet.

170
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,019
Times like these,
he'd be out there chopping his friends.

171
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,396
[inhales sharply] Maybe he would chop you.

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,482
[birds chirping]

173
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,843
- [gun firing in distance]
- [Annick] What about you, Peyton?

174
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,572
What brought you here?

175
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,284
- Uh... Peace Projects.
- [Mutesi] Yes.

176
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,161
That we can see.

177
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,621
What is the reason?

178
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,332
Mmm, no reason.

179
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,103

- [footsteps passing by]

180
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,921
[men speaking indistinctly]

181
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,345
[footsteps fading]

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,643
[sighs]

183
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,729
[sighs]

184
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,401
How do you be a nun

185
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,902
in this world?

186
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,569
[chuckles softly]

187
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,030
Well, child,

188
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,324
God is not of this world.

189
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,452
He created it, but he is not of it.

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,332
But all we really know
is what we can see, right?

191
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,420
What we can physically feel, you know?
And anything can change, just like that.

192
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,546
[snaps fingers]

193
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,340
One thing happens, and...

194
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,719
it changes everything else.

195
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,012
The world does seem that way.

196
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,057
You never know what is coming next.

197
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:10,062
And... right when you think you do,
it's completely something else.

198
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,398
That is why you have no children?

199
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,859
I assume they'd be here, not us.

200
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,321
Children have not been
in God's plan for us.

201
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,116
We have not been able to.

202
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,747
It will happen.

203
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,252
[in Kinyarwanda] You've had miscarriages?

204
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,339
[in English] Four.

205
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,803
[somber music playing]

206
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,224
M... miscarriages?

207
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,645
This time...

208
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,608
this boy is the one.

209
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,205
[indistinct chatter outside]

210
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,251
- [boy 1 chuckling]
- [boys speaking indistinctly]

211
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,631
[grunting]

212
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,091
Hey, hey, come on now.

213
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,637
[boy 1] Christophe
is going to stomp you so bad later.

214
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
[boy 2] Christophe is gone.

215
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,765
- Pop says for good.
- [boy 1] Gone?

216
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,850
[in Kinyarwanda] Where? Why?

217
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,745
[boy 2 in English] Because
Christophe was a cockroach.

218
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,646
[man in Kinyarwanda]
Hey! What are you doing?

219
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,273
[in English] Identity card! Now!

220
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,277
[in Kinyarwanda] I don't have it.

221
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,265
- [boy 3 in English] We are Hutu, I swear.
- [man] Shut up!

222
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,615
Yes.

223
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,993
Your father is Godefroid, no?

224
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,203
[boy 1] You know Papa?

225
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,872
Football?

226
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,417
This is not the time for games.

227
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,795
- You proud to be Hutu, boys?
- [boy 2] Yes.

228
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,173
[man] This place, this land,
is your birthright.

229
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,842
Not them cockroaches!

230
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,970
And you, you are old enough.

231
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,134
You should have
your identity card everywhere you go!

232
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,057
Yes, sir.

233
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,309
Don't you want it known
you are the better race?

234
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,728
[tense music playing]

235
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,231
This is the time for cleansing!

236
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,567
Play your part, brother.

237
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,855
The penalty today is one ball.

238
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,740
[boy 3 in Kinyarwanda] Go!

239
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,658
[in English] Get the ball.

240
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,909
[in Kinyarwanda] Run!

241
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,995
[gasps]

242
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,553
[man in English] Hey, hey!
What are you doing over there?

243
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,056
[Annick exhales]

244
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,976
[man] Nice ball.

245
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,606
You two, go home.

246
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,150
- You, brother, come with me.
- [boy 3 mumbling]

247
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,233
[man] Come!

248
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,243
[Jeanette] So we clap first,

249
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,913
and then the right hand
meets once in the middle,

250
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,455
and then the left.

251
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,709
- Yes.
- [Peyton] Oh, I know this game.

252
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,711
[chuckling]

253
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,922
- Oh my gosh, you're good.
- [both chuckling]

254
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924
- [mumbling]
- [Peyton laughs]

255
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,383
- [shushing]
- [gun firing outside]

256
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,011
[whispering] I'm serious.
This is not a time for games.

257
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,721
What else are we supposed to do?

258
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,102
[Peyton] Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish.

259
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,190
How many pieces do you wish?

260
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,442
Mutesi, how many pieces?

261
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,610
[people screaming outside]

262
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,403
Oh. Um...

263
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,821
Nine.

264
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,993
One, two, three, four, five,

265
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,246
six, seven, eight, nine.

266
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,541
And you are not it.

267
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,001
[man yelling outside]

268
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,462
- [Peyton] Annick, you're not it.
- [gun firing in distance]

269
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,798
- Oh, oh, oh.
- [Peyton] Take your foot out.

270
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,508
[Annick] Oh.

271
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,260
So, what happens when you're it?

272
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,638
Well, whoever's it has to chase...

273
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,434
Whoever is it has to...

274
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,078
[Mutesi, Jeanette] I declare thumb war.

275
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,022
Five, six, seven, eight,
try to keep your thumbs straight.

276
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,650
[Jeanette laughing]

277
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,986
[women laughing]

278
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,116
[Mutesi laughing] I've got you.

279
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,201
[solemn music playing]

280
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,085
[dog barking in distance]

281
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,550
[guns firing in distance]

282
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,305
[wind chimes tinkling]

283
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,057
[Annick humming]

284
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,072
[birds chirping]

285
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,575
[men speaking indistinctly outside]

286
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,042
[sighs]

287
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,796
[vehicle passing by]

288
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,301
- [woman panting outside]
- [guns firing]

289
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,226
[gasps] A woman is hiding.

290
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,394
A woman is hiding.

291
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,355
[gasps]

292
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,984
She can join us.

293
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,610
We can call to her.

294
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,738
No, no, no, no. It's unsafe.

295
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,574
- We cannot leave her.
- [Annick] Not with our voices.

296
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,368
We could throw something out there,
get her attention.

297
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,454
[indistinct chatter outside]

298
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,126
[man 1 in Kinyarwanda]
I don't care if it tastes like piss,

299
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,087
as long as it gets me drunk.

300
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,464
[chuckling]

301
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,466
I know him. Pascal.

302
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,343
A member of our church.

303
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,719
He will help her.

304
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,596
Thank you, Jesus.

305
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,680
He's Hutu?

306
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,974
Yes, but like you.

307
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,686
You cannot trust him,
no matter how well you know him.

308
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,770
No.

309
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,271
I know this boy.

310
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,649
Trust me.

311
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,317
Trust in God.

312
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,279
- I'll call to him.
- [Annick] Jeanette!

313
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,323
Francois will come.

314
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,450
[Pascal in Kinyarwanda]
Look here, a cockroach!

315
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,374
[Hutu soldier in English]
A cockroach. [laughs]

316
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,205
- Come, come. Move.
- [woman] No!

317
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,706
[screaming]

318
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,667
[Pascal in Kinyarwanda]
Bring her along quick.

319
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,418
Let's get this over with.

320
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,421
[Hutu soldier in English] This will end
easy and painless for you

321
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,798
if you tell us now.

322
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,884
Ah, you think we won't find them?

323
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,511
We found you.

324
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,721
It is my job to hunt them down.

325
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,933
- If you won't tell us, well...
- [woman] We all scattered so fast.

326
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,852
[Hutu soldier] Ah! Like cockroaches?

327
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,562
[men laughing]

328
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,773
[Pascal] You do not want
to feel this in your flesh.

329
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,028
You don't want your husband
or your children to feel it either.

330
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,366
If you tell us where they are,
they won't have to.

331
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,828
I will feed them each a bullet instead.

332
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,247
- Come, come, come.
- Please. [sobbing]

333
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,624
- You can stop this, please.
- [Pascal] Oh, shut up!

334
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,753
You know, you really are a bitch!

335
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,837
Begging.

336
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,592
And those ugly children, like an ugly dog.

337
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,676
Look at me!

338
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,988
[in Kinyarwanda] You fucking cockroach.

339
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,850
[in English] I say
she's more like a fat fucking cow

340
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,727
ready to push out another one, eh?

341
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,813
[Pascal] Where are you going, huh?
Where are you going? Huh?

342
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,566
- Take her over there!
- Oh God, no! No!

343
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,194
- No! [sobbing]
- [Pascal] Oh, shut up!

344
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,738
- I'll teach this one a lesson.
- No!

345
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,656
[sobbing] No! No!

346
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,035
No! No!

347
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,578
[Pascal] Shut up! Shut up!

348
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,330
[woman screaming] No!

349
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,040
[sobbing]

350
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,791
[screaming] No! No!

351
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,588
- No! [screaming]
- [Mutesi sobs]

352
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,299
- [woman screaming]
- [Pascal grunting]

353
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,847
[Annick sobbing]

354
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,350
[woman sobbing]

355
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,068
[Pascal in Kinyarwanda]
It's your turn, brother.

356
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,524
I will hold her.

357
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,152
- [Mutesi sobbing]
- [woman yelping]

358
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,784
[in English] Where are your cockroaches?

359
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,452
You will rot in hell for this!

360
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,472
- You will rot in hell...
- [Hutu soldier yelling]

361
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,580
[Annick gasping]

362
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,791
- [Hutu soldier grunting]
- [machete hacking]

363
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,000
[woman groaning]

364
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,086
[solemn music playing]

365
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,800
[sobbing]

366
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,730
[Mutesi sobbing]

367
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,909
[dogs barking in distance]

368
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,788
[dogs snarling]

369
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,711
- [dogs growling, barking]
- [gags]

370
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,379
[Annick] Dogs.

371
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,089
Are they...

372
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,174
[dogs snarling]

373
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,890
It was Akimana Murenzi.

374
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,561
She and her husband ran the main bakery.

375
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,522
And the two who killed her... [sniffling]

376
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,108
...they were still practically boys.

377
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,111
Pascal, he used to sing in the choir.

378
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,032
He had the most beautiful voice.

379
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,742
[Mutesi] You did this.

380
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,368
You didn't want her here.

381
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,329
She's dead because of you.

382
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,665
- No, we are alive because of her.
- [sobbing] She was... She was...

383
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,877
She was pregnant.

384
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,629
Why didn't you say she was pregnant?

385
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,717
That would have made the difference?
Only women who bear children matter?

386
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,155
- The rest are not worth your mercy?
- [Jeanette] She has been merciful.

387
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,889
This is about God's mercy.

388
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,808
- [Annick] There was nothing...
- Do not touch me!

389
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,436
We only listened to her.

390
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,688
- [sobbing]
- [Mutesi] Only listened.

391
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,567
They would never kill a precious American.

392
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,569
Akimana should have been in this room.

393
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,613
No, no. Shh. This is not God's truth.

394
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
Francois will help us.

395
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,660
- I know it is hard.
- Are you mad or stupid?

396
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,997
Your husband is surely dead.

397
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,250
We must have faith and pray.

398
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,710
Pray to who?

399
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,129
Who is listening?

400
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,298
The Lord Jesus is always listening.

401
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,718
People are being slaughtered
like sows in the street, and for what?

402
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,970
God listens to us all.

403
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,972
He may not always give us the answer...

404
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,683
Like sows in the street!

405
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,770
Your make-believe is over.

406
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,773
People who have killed will have to answer
for their transgressions

407
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,108
on the Day of Judgment.

408
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,610
This is their judgment.

409
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,694
Right now.

410
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,322
What they did,

411
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,949
no woman...

412
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:35,414
should ever have to suffer that.

413
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,585
[sobbing]

414
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:48,468
At night, my uncle would...

415
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,221
[somber music playing]

416
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,305
[exhales]

417
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,438
[continues sobbing]

418
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,730
[Jeanette] I am sorry.

419
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,024
I know what that is like.

420
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,319
My father, he would...

421
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,201
He would hurt my mother
that way sometimes.

422
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,957
He would force himself on her.

423
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,334
[dogs growling, barking]

424
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,044
[shuddering]

425
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,671
I'll kill those fucking dogs.

426
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,798
Your people started this.

427
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,385
White man came, said, "Identity cards."

428
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,805
Said, "Hutu get this,"
said, "Tutsi get that."

429
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,891
[man singing indistinctly outside]

430
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,728
- [dogs barking]
- [man] Shut up!

431
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,771
- [gun firing]
- [dog yelping]

432
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,064
[footsteps treading]

433
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,401
[man speaking indistinctly, laughing]

434
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,780
Look into my eyes

435
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,118
and tell me that those boys
do not deserve to suffer in hell.

436
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,954
Do it.

437
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,038
Do it.

438
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,333
Pass judgment onto those pigs.

439
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,543
I never dare judge anyone.

440
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,212
[Mutesi] Why is that?

441
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,632
Because you'd have to judge your father
for being a pig?

442
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,886
And perhaps Akimana
should have been in here,

443
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,804
and you out there.

444
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,932
[Peyton crying]

445
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,685
[somber music playing]

446
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,399
[Mutesi] Enough of this.

447
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,904
Akimana is with the Lord now.

448
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,323
Let us pray.

449
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,493
Heavenly Father,

450
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,080
we pray for the soul of Akimana Murenzi.

451
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,250
May you keep her, Lord.

452
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,627
May you keep her.

453
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,934
[people wailing outside]

454
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,477
[Mutesi] Those men knew her.

455
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,399
They knew she had children missing.

456
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,983
Hidden.

457
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,112
- [gun firing in distance]
- Why would you hide us?

458
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,491
When the violence broke out,
the militia was pillaging homes.

459
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,160
Francois says they have lists of names.

460
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,163
Names of Tutsi and of Hutu moderates.

461
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,961
Francois is a teacher at a school
for the education of both Tutsi and Hutu.

462
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,299
We never believed
Tutsi were better than us,

463
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,635
no matter what prejudice you've seen

464
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,054
or what you were told as children.

465
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,306
[people screaming]

466
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,891
No person is better than any other.

467
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,022
And we must love ourselves
to be able to love each other.

468
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,445
You were a lonely little girl.

469
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,410
You think you're so smart.

470
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,833
You only listen to judge and not hear.

471
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,296
You are right.
I... I was a lonely little girl.

472
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,131
But I see...

473
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,719
you still are.

474
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,562
- [stomach growling]
- [Jeanette grunts softly]

475
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,648
[rain pattering]

476
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,124
[thunder rumbling]

477
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,961
[guns firing in distance]

478
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,174
[Peyton inhales]

479
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,650
[people clamoring in distance]

480
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,194
[gunfire continues]

481
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,619
[wrapper rustling]

482
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,623
[in Kinyarwanda]
What are you doing? What is this?

483
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,877
[in English] You hide food from us,
and you have it all for yourself.

484
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,671
- [Jeanette, Peyton] No!
- What else?

485
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,717
- [unzipping]
- Mutesi!

486
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,469
Stop! She came to feed the poor Africans.

487
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,929
[sighs] I came to teach.

488
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,849
[Annick] Mutesi,
this is not for you to... Stop this!

489
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,576
- This is not...
- She was letting us starve!

490
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,436
[Peyton] No, I was saving it, in case...

491
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,605
What if we're in here for a while?

492
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,275
I... I was going to share the food. I was.

493
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,235
No, you keep it.

494
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,612
I don't need your disgusting food.

495
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,909
[sighs]

496
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:07,953
It's just,

497
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,208
there's no way to know
if Francois is coming back.

498
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,919
So if... if this is all we have, then...

499
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,340
- [grunts softly]
- [wrapper rustling]

500
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,427
We are all starving.

501
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,512
Just eat. Here.

502
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,461
[Jeanette] Father, bless this food.
Forgive us our trespasses...

503
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,700
[flashlight clicking]

504
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,417
- [man] Open up.
- [banging in distance]

505
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,336
[men speaking indistinctly]

506
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,587
- Wake...
- [flies buzzing]

507
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,254
Caleb.

508
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,550
Wake... Hmm.

509
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,345
[men yelling outside]

510
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,264
- [glass shattering]
- [gasps]

511
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,100
Why are you not asleep?

512
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,813
Can I make a confession?

513
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,856
[Jeanette] I am not a priest.

514
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,319
Yes.

515
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,031
Make your confession.

516
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,621
I'm scared.

517
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,166
We are all scared.

518
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,544
We must stay faithful.

519
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,296
He's five months today.

520
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,631
And I feel so...

521
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,471
This is all I ever wanted,

522
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,723
being a mother,

523
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,184
having a family.

524
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,729
Trust in God
to give you the gifts you ask for.

525
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,053
[Annick] You are right, I know,

526
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,942
but I can't help asking
what keeps Francois for so long.

527
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,447
Wherever he is,

528
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,576
he is thinking about you and that baby boy

529
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,080
and doing <i>everything </i>he can
to come back here.

530
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,876
Five nights.

531
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,465
Five nights.

532
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,771
[gasps]

533
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,526
A moment ago,

534
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,154
his first movement.

535
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,114
[in Kinyarwanda] Truly!

536
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,197
Oh.

537
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,245

[mumbling]

539
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,500
God has given you a strong boy.

540
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,924
- [chuckling]
- But now you need to sleep.

541
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,592
Time to trade.

542
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,303
[uplifting music playing]

543
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,899
Thank you.

544
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,319
[Jeanette] Close your eyes.

545
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,404
[music continues]

546
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,173
Do you like that book, Peyton?

547
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,675
Oh. [chuckles]

548
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,968
Oh, this? Uh, yeah.

549
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,178
I'd say it's a classic.

550
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,390
Would you mind reading it to us?

551
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,351
I'm... I'm not very good
at reading out loud. Um...

552
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,937
But... But you can read it.

553
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,068
I haven't tried reading English
in a very long time,

554
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,028
almost ten years.

555
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,781
I could not read it well. [chuckles]

556
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,117
Really? You... You speak it perfectly.

557
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,400
[Jeanette] French is the same.

558
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,830
Most all Rwandans speak it,
but we are not really taught the letters.

559
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:19,913
Yeah.

560
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,124
I do.

561
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,003
Because you're Tutsi?

562
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,005
[Mutesi] Jeanette is Tutsi.

563
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,799
It has nothing to do with that,
not for me.

564
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,969
My family and I
have been goat farmers my whole life.

565
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,430
No more privileged than any Hutu.

566
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,141
I wanted to know the language.

567
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,143
I taught myself.

568
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,070
Thank you, Peyton.

569
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,988
Yeah.

I was afraid. I was afraid you were...

596
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,531
You were so long.

597
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,199
[Francois] I am sorry,<i> ma puce.</i>

You must know
that I will never, never leave you.

No, no, no. Stay... stay there. Stay hidden.

00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,709
How is he?

601
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,505
- He kicks hard.
- [Francois chuckles]

602
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,673
He is strong.

603
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,300
[Francois laughing] Like his father, eh?

604
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,802
[Annick] Mmm.

605
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,973
What kept you?

606
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,772
[Francois] It has been a bit of chaos.

607
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,735
But I remembered you had Peyton's food
and some water already.

608
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,657
I tried to come back to bring some more,
but it has not been possible.

609
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,285
Come. We... We must go.

610
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,744
The UN is here to take you.

611
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,539
[shushing] Not all of you.

612
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,167
Only her. Peyton.

613
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,669
They ask for whites only.

I... I am sorry,<i> ma puce,</i>
but our time will come soon.

Come. We must go.

Only whites? Why?

[Francois] The UN
will come for the rest of us.

There's no time for this.

We have to leave now.

- [Francois] The militia is here.
- I can't.

630
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,704
[Francois] This is your last chance.

631

00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,042
[Francois] It is too late.

- [Annick] I love you too.

634
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,116

Children belong home safe.

639
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,948
Why didn't you go?

640
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,284
I'm not a child. [chuckles]

641
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,537
You are a child enough.
Someone should be protecting you.

642
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,749
- What if I can't keep you safe?
- The UN's here.

643
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,795
- They'll come back for us tomorrow.
- One more day your mother worries.

644
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,297
My parents haven't worried
about me in years.

645
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:42,385
She should have left.
She cuts our food rations by a fourth.

646
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,887
We would have starved already without her.

647
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:50,142
Peyton, the love of a mother and a father
is like nothing on this Earth.

648
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:58,734
I like to imagine that
that's real for every child, but, uh...

649
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,736
[inhales sharply]

650
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,157
Some kids, they mess up bad enough,
and there's no more chances after that.

651
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,494
It's like love can't find them anymore.

652
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,163
[Annick] Mmm.

653
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,750
- Your mother's love...
- I killed my little brother.

654
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,214
Four years ago.

655
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,804
My parents, they were at a work party,

656
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,974
and... Caleb...

657
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,187
he wanted to watch<i> Ghostbusters.</i>

658
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,607
So I told him that I would drive him
to the video store

659
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,318
if he cleaned up my mess.

660
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,030
Put my beer bottles
in the neighbor's trash.

661
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,575
And he did it.

662
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,952
[sobbing]

663
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:55,082
He did it because he didn't want me
to get sent away again.

664
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,131
I shouldn't have been driving.

665
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,468
I had no idea how drunk I was. [sniffling]

666
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,553
And, uh... [sniffling]

667
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,558
...everyone agrees that it...
it shouldn't have been Caleb.

668
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,435
[sobbing]

669
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,188
And I've tried

670
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,191
a few times since to, um,

671
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,237
unburden them of myself, but...

672
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,323
[chuckles]

673
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,534
...I'm still here.

674
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,874
I knew it.

675
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,127
That is why you are in Rwanda.

676
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,838
Your own atonement.

677
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,050
That scar there,

678
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,677
is that you trying to unburden them?

679
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,890
Why didn't it work?

680
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,475
[Annick] That is enough, Mutesi.

681
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,270
She was their burden,
and now she is our burden, so tell us...

682
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,354
[Annick] Enough.

683
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,857
You think because you are so smart,

684
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,277
because you see through people,
it gives you the right to be so cruel?

685
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,156
I would ask you... [exhales]

686
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,785
...why you pick us all apart,
but it's already so obvious.

687
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,580
You were violated in the worst ways,

688
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,667
but that does not give you the right
to violate everyone else.

689
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,169
So please leave us alone.

690
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,381
I would if you didn't lock us in here.

691
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
[Peyton] It wasn't deep enough.

692
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,724
You don't actually have to cut that deep
to get to the radial artery, but, uh,

693
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,144
I was just too scared.

694
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,651
[Mutesi] Ah. Finally,

695
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,112
she passes judgment.

696
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,909
No amount of volunteer work
will save your soul.

697
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,581
Taking one's own life is the greatest sin.

698
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,209
Only repentance before God might save you.

699
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,962
[sobs]

700
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:13,721
You told me once that you became a nun
because your father was a priest.

701
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,308
He was a rapist.

702
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,606
[Annick] Satisfied?

703
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,066
Or shall we suffer more?

704
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,236
You don't know suffering.

705
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,073
Imagine being forgotten
because of what you've suffered.

706
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,951
Because no one knows what to say.

707
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,663
They look through you
as if you're not there.

708
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,916
- Yes, I walk...
- [groans]

709
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,919
[exhales]

710
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,170
[Annick groans]

711
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,549
Hmm.

712
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,270
Four babies have lived and died inside me.

713
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,942
Does that give me the right
to be cruel like you?

714
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,658
When Francois returns,
you have my blessings to leave.

715
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,160
I will not stop you.

716
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,748
[flies buzzing]

717
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,963
[indistinct chatter outside]

[urinating]

719
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,091
[man in French] Fuck you, idiots!

720
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,512
[in English] Allow me to piss in peace.

721
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,350
Too much beers.

722
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,435
[continues urinating]

723
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,648
Too much of the fucking beers.

724
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,985
[belt clinks]

725
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,446
- <i>Bouffons, </i>who is next on our list?
- [zipping]

726
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,530
[man 2] Hurry up.

727
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,576
- Let's go.
- [man 3] I'll meet you there.

728
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,120
[men speaking indistinctly]

729
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
[sighs]

00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,380
[man announcing indistinctly on speaker]

731
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,428
I can read it again.

732
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,477
Right, repent before God.

733
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,314
I've tried it already.

734
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,023
Doesn't work.

735
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,574
I was thinking I may give it a try.

736
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,868
I said before,
I haven't tried in many years.

737
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,079
It's never too late to learn

738
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,831
and teach your son.

739
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,918
We have nothing else to do
but have men piss on us.

740
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,086
[chuckles softly]

741

[Francois] I'm sorry
I was so long to return.

762
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,112
There's been no safe time
with the damned rain.

763
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,864
The Hutu army has been patrolling.

764
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,658
Here, drink this.

765
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,121
Good, good. [sighs]

766
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,291
What about the UN?

767
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,251
How much longer?

768
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,296
[Francois] They, uh...

769
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,966
The UN is gone.

770
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,551
They left.

771
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,969
[Annick] What?

772
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,389
When will they be back?

773
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,227
You wanted to leave here?
Now is your chance.

We have your name.

- [tense music playing]
- [Francois shushing]

778

Here's the rest. Here, take it.

779
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,158
Do not speak. Do not move.

780
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:45,992
I must go.

781
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,662
- Stay with us.
- [Francois] No, they will find us all.

782
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,289
Stop this right now. Release me.

[Francois] Yes, yes.
Uh, give me a moment, please.

[Francois] Oh, hello, Commander.

791
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,477
[Commander] We have your name,
Francois. You see?

792
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,062
- [footsteps treading]
- [Francois] Yes. This...

793
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,856
This... This must be a mistake, sir.

794
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,066
[Commander] Would you call
your neighbors liars?

795
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,568
[Francois] My neighbors?

796
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,862
[man in Kinyarwanda]
They are faithful to our cause.

797
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,655
They have informed us you are not.

798
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,091
[Commander in English] Is anyone else
here in your home with you?

799
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,495
You two stay here, watch for cockroaches.

800
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,247
[Francois] It's just me. No cockroaches.

801
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,333
[Commander]
This is your wife in this picture?

802
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,711
[Francois] Yes. She's Hutu.
On a trip with her mother in Gitarama.

803
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,839
[Commander] And what is this?

804
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,424
You won some recognition?

805
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,593
[Francois] No, sir. Yes, sir.

806
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,512
Well, I am a teacher.

807
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,640
This plaque recognizes
the accreditation for my school.

808
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,723
[Commander] New Hope.

809
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,142
[in Kinyarwanda] How nice.

00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,227
[loud bang]

811
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,436
I haven't heard of it.

812
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,937
[Francois] It is new.

813
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,357
A school for science.

814
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,121
[Commander] Do you educate Tutsi children?

815
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,903
- [in English] No, no.
- [Jeanette shushing]

816
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,907
[Francois in Kinyarwanda] Oh, no.
I educate Hutu children.

817
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,951
Only Hutu.

818
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,536
[footsteps thumping]

819
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,747
[Commander] Dare you lie to me?

820
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,165
[gun cocking]

821
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,462
[Francois in English] No, sir.

822
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,506
[man] Oh...

823
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,800
How wonderful for you.

824
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,927
Is this your first?

825
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,178
And a boy?

826
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,558
- [Commander] A strong Hutu man, eh?
- [Francois chuckles] Ye... yes, sir.

827
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,102
[Commander] Brought up
in a world without Tutsis.

828
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:36,687
Very good.

829
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,522
[in Kinyarwanda] Come, brothers!

830
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,358
Let's leave him
to paint the boy's nursery.

831
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,569
You can join up with us when you're done.

832
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,656
[man in English] Nothing more gratifying
than killing cockroaches.

833
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,992
[Commander] We will be back
to visit again, Francois.

834
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,994
I look forward to meeting your wife.

835

Wait, we must set rations!
No, stop! We are all starving!

841
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,972
- Annick is pregnant!

[panting]

844
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,813
What is wrong with you?
You are like those dogs.

845
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,316
I will kill you for that rice.

846
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,651
- [Annick grunts]
- [gasps]

847

849
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,037
This is hell!

850
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,121
[screaming]

851
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,707
[Jeanette] You are so ungrateful!

852
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,335
It sickens me to look at you!
It sickens me!

853
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,337
[Mutesi screaming]

854
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,715
- [Peyton] Jeanette.
- [muffled screaming]

855
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,967
Jeanette. Jeanette, that's enough!

856
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,095

857
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,351

[somber music playing]

859
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,028
We are going to die in here.

860
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,159
Over two weeks and nothing from Belgium.

861
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,496
[inhales] Who is going to end this?

862
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,585
You stupid woman.

863
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,628
A Hutu...

864
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,716
free to leave this hell.

865
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,430
Why are you here?

866
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,560
I'm not freer than you.

867
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,271
[somber music continues]

868
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,407
[inhales deeply]

869
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,013
[Jeanette] I was so hungry.

870
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,685
[Jeanette sobbing]

871
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,775
My father said she died in sin.

872
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,032
The greatest sin.

873
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,951
My mother...

874
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,246
I am afraid to ask God

875
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,416
where does her soul rest?

876
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,046
Have I been faultless enough
to absolve her?

877
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,760
I was so hungry.

878
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,847
I'm so sorry.

879
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,932
[sobbing]

880
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,063
[pensive music playing]

881
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,722
"Round

882
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,225
the world."

883
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,810
[Jeanette] "Round the world."

884
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,394
[Annick] "They are..."

885
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,565
- What is that little thing up there?
- [dog barking outside]

886
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,775
[Peyton] What thing?

887
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,777
Uh, that's an apostrophe.

888
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,488
They put it there
when a letter is missing.

889
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,490
When the letter is missing?

890
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,868
Why don't they just put in the letter?

891
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,997
Mmm, because, well,
it makes you pronounce it differently.

892
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,250
It's like a... a shortcut.

893
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,709
It's called a contraction.

894
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,711
- [goat bleating outside]
- Contraction.

895
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,671
[Peyton] Mmm.

896
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,702
[in Kinyarwanda] I don't get it.

897
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,968
I don't know.

898
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,390
[in English] Why do you want
to speak so fast?

899
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,016
[Jeanette scoffs]

900
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,144
- Why don't you speak slower?
- [laughs]

901
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,438
You see? You just said "don't."

902
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,942
That's... That's a contraction.
It comes from "do not."

903
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,236
Um, see, here.

904
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,364
[man yelling outside]

905
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,157

[inspirational music playing]

907
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,057
Peo...

908
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,811

911

Three this time.

912

"Those

913
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,326

oats."

915
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,041
You know it. It's...

916
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,834
[Annick] No, no, no. Don't tell me.

917
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,504
T-H-O-S-E.

918
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,716
Here. Write it then.

919
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,015
I don't want to.

920
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,058
[chuckles]

921
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,685
It's obvious you do.

922
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,104
Any time you want to play, let us know.

923
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,026

[rain pattering]

926
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,291
How am I doing?

927
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,876
You're doing great.

928
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,963
[giggles]

929
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,591

[solemn music playing]

934
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,252
What are you writing?

935
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,047
Letters for my son.

936
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,552
You'll read them to him someday.

937
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,307
What do they say?

938
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,519
[Annick] I'm only on my second one so far.

939
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,064
"My sweet boy."

940
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,232
"Today,

941
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,278
we marked the wall for day 34."

942
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,242
"It feels like a lifetime in this room."

943
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,245
"I forget the smell of flowers."

944
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,666
"Can't remember the feel
of a bath on my skin."

945
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,087
"But I learn things I have never known."

946

"An American girl

I have thought must have a perfect life,

948
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,351
but she has sought death."

949
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,564
"A sister of the faith,

950
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,108
one with God,

you will be my great happiness."

[solemn music continues]

961

"I write these things for you...

962

so you will know the truths
we cannot always see in the open."

963
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,498
That is all so far.

[music continues]

965
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,678
I don't want to die with this anger.

966
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,559
May I add my name?

967
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,820
My family and I, our farm is quite small,

968
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,699
but I've always wanted
to make things change.

969
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,202
When I was...

970
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,915
When my uncle would...

971
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,797
The women in my village,
they would do nothing.

972
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,010
These women, like mothers to me,

973
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,928
the men like fathers,

974
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,433
my own mother and father,

975
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:00,727
they did nothing

976
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,646
because of fear and shame.

977
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,279
It burned me up like fire.

978

I was with my mother
when the killing started.

981
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:36,137
There was a moment
I could have protected her,

982
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,223
but I ran.

983
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,438
I see your suffering,

984
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,564
all of you.

985
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,071
It is so familiar.

986
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:01,162
If I do nothing for you now,
then I am no different

987
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,082
than those women who did nothing for me.

988
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:14,634
We... are one.

[women laughing]

992
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,746
You should write his name.

993

[laughs] I don't know it.

994
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,837
Maybe we should name him...

995
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,880
Elijah?

and every Hutu moderate.

1033

They will look for him.

This is why we must fight. Huh?

1250
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:19,426
We must live.

1251
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,970
[Francois sobbing]

1252
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:26,849
[grunts]

1253
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,354
[grunting]

1254
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:34,441
[Francois sobbing, kissing]

1255
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:40,280
<i>Ma puce, </i>the rebel army is fighting back,
and they are winning.

1256
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,324
The Hutus have begun to flee.

1257
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,036
Their roadblocks are nearly abandoned.

1258
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:49,414
We can make it
to the Hôtel des Mille Collines

1259
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,208
if we go in the night. Huh?

1260
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,881
Make them eat.

1261
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,301
[Annick] The rebels have come.

1262
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,428
The rebels have come.

1263
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,097
Here, eat this.

1264
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,475
- [weakly] Rebels?
- [Annick] Yes.

1265
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,227
- Is that good?
- [Annick] Yes.

1266
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,021
Mutesi.

1267
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:15,649
Mutesi.

1268
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:16,732
Eat.

1269
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,234
Jeanette.

1270
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:21,862
Jeanette.

1271
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:25,282
Jeanette?

1272
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:28,828
Jeanette?

1273
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,832
[groaning weakly]

1274
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,212
[Francois] Here, eat, drink,

1275
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,882
move around, get stronger.

1276
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,552
You only need to survive here
one day more.

1277
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,847
- Only one?
- [Francois] Yes,<i> ma puce.</i>

1278
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:48,557
Only one day more.

1279
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,394
[solemn music playing]

1280
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,397
[hatch closes]

01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,400
[Annick laughing weakly]

[rain pattering]

1283
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,493
[thunder rumbling]

1284
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,997
[weakly] "This nectar turns into a treat

1285
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:16,710
when bees make honey, mmm, so sweet."

1286
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:24,134
[Mutesi, weakly] "Seeds of all the animals

1287
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:27,471
are planted just the same,

1288
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,851
creating baby goats and other creatures,

1289
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,603
wild and..."

01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,444
- [vehicle doors open, close]
- [man outside] Out! All of you!

1292
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,112
Peter, let's go. Out.

1293
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:49,993
[in Kinyarwanda] Go inside
and bring Francois out here.

1294
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:51,119
[kids whimpering]

1295
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:54,414
[Peter in Kinyarwanda]
Seba... Sir, my students...

1296
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:56,178
[Seba in English] Peter, do what is right.

1297
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,045
[in Kinyarwanda] Do it, Peter!
Or your cockroach students will all die.

1298
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,755
[in English] It's children.

1299
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:04,424
[Peter in Kinyarwanda]
Francois is not here.

1300
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,760
[Seba in Kinyarwanda]
You know he is not here.

1301
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,845
So you know where he is!

1302
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,472
[Peter] I do not know.

1303
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:11,973
- [Seba] Liar!
- [kids crying]

1304
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,810
[Seba in English] Peter,
earn your place among Hutus again.

1305
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,312
[in Kinyarwanda]
Either tell us where Francois is

1306
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,690
or take my machete
and chop these cockroaches for me.

1307
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,319
If you do not, I will kill them,

1308
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,279
you, and your wife.

1309
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,508
- [Peter speaking indistinctly]
- [gun cocks]

1310
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:32,077
- [Seba in English] Do it, or it is you.
- [Peter sobbing]

1311
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,790
- [in Kinyarwanda] I'm sorry!
- [kids crying]

1312
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:38,458
[Peter] I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

[kids continue screaming]

1317
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,143
[Peter in Kinyarwanda] No more! No more!

1318
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,522
I cannot finish them, please!

1319
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,081
[Seba in English] Tell us where Francois

1320
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,694
and the rest
of your cockroaches are hiding,

1321
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:08,321
and I will let those two babies live.

1322
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,866
[in Kinyarwanda] You have my word.

1323
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,869
- [girl crying]
- [Seba] It's okay, little girl. Don't cry.

1324
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:16,329
[girl screaming]

1325
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,331
[Peter] Okay, okay! Stop, stop!

1326
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,542
Please, don't hurt her!

1327
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,254
They are hiding in a small school.

1328
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:27,757
It is new. A few miles outside Kigali.

1329
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,501
[Mutesi in English] New Hope.

1330
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,553
[Peter] New Hope School of Science.

1331
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:32,971
- [gun firing]
- [girl screaming]

1332
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,347
[gun firing]

1333
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,017
[Seba in Kinyarwanda] Let's go!

1334
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,102
[men speaking indistinctly]

1335
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,273
- [vehicle doors closing]
- [engine starts]

1336
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,320
[vehicle pulling away]

1337
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,123
I don't wanna die.

1338
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,001
[somber music playing]

1339
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:05,795
[sobbing]

1340
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,177
Francois, he is...

1341
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,556
He said only one day.

1342
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:19,558
Today.

1343
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,313
[Mutesi] We have to get out of here.

1344
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,943
One, two, three.

1345
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,111
[grunts, pants]

1346
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,323
[Mutesi] We must keep trying.

1347
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:35,367
It will open. Push again.

1348
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,660
It has been all day.

1349
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,912
The lock is too strong.

1350
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:40,497
And no key.

1351
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,167
[door opens]

1352
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,711
[footsteps thumping]

1353
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,588
Is it Francois?

1354
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,465
[objects clattering]

1355
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,676
[footsteps thumping]

1356
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:55,720
- [Seba in Kinyarwanda] Search everywhere.
- [objects clattering]

1357
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,181
You've seen how they can fit
into the smallest hole.

1358
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,687
Annick Irakoze.

1359
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,982
[in English] You and your husband
are traitors to your people.

1360
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,150
Find the attic.

1361
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,822
[in Kinyarwanda] Annick, if you surrender,
perhaps we will spare your life.

1362
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,156
[object dragging on floor]

1363
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,157
[glass shattering]

1364
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,242
[footsteps treading]

1365
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:19,648
[in English] Come out right now!

1366
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,622
I know you are up there.

1367
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,378
- Francois confessed.
- [Annick sobs]

1368
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,341
[man 1] Seba, I think I heard one of them.

1369
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,844
[man 2] I heard it too.

1370
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:40,098
Tell her how we tortured her husband.

1371
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,266
[speaking Kinyarwanda]

1372
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,935
[Seba] We found him hiding in that school.

1373
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,355
He shitted himself
like a frightened animal.

1374
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,567
[in Kinyarwanda] We cut off his feet first
so he could not run.

1375
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:52,861
Still, he would not tell us a thing

1376
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,113
until his castration.

1377
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,448
[sobbing]

1378
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,284
[Seba in English] He told us
everything we needed to know.

1379
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:03,371
By then, he was in a lot of pain,
so we tried to be merciful.

1380
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:07,083
Offered him a bullet
for only 7,000 francs.

1381
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,668
A discount.

1382
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,587
But he had no money.

1383
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,132
So I slit his throat open.

1384
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,217
[ominous music playing]

1385
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,971
[Seba continues in Kinyarwanda]

1386
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,078
[Hutu soldier] Seba,
the commander is looking for you.

1387
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:27,496
[Seba in Kinyarwanda] Give me more time!

1388
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,581
[soldier in English] He said now.

1389
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:30,648
[Seba in Kinyarwanda] All right! Let's go.

1390
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,110
But we will come back at sunup
to find these cockroaches.

1391
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,196
[footsteps receding]

1392
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,115
[loud thudding]

1393
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:41,367
[loud clank]

1394
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,453
- [men yelling outside]
- [guns firing]

1395
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,623
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

1396
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,709
[Mutesi] They will come soon.

1397
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:50,877
[panting]

1398
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,171
The storm is loud enough to cover us.

1399
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,340
Who will take us?

1400
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,384
- They killed Francois.
- Quiet.

1401
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,598
If we can get out of here,

1402
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,184
we can get to the Mille Collines.

1403
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:08,435
I know the way.

1404
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,273
So many bodies in the street.

1405
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,943
- [people clamoring]
- [guns firing]

1406
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,403
[in Kinyarwanda] We are leaving soon.

1407
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,947
[man screaming outside]

1408
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,573
- [Mutesi in English] Come.
- No.

1409
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:23,784
Leave me here.

1410
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:28,665
If you stay, we will all stay.

1411
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:34,337
And I would rather die
than let any man hurt me again.

1412
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:36,839
Now sit up.

1413
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,675
[in Kinyarwanda] Be strong.

1414
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,469
[in English] Elijah may still live.

1415
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:45,682
If he is to be a strong boy,
he must have a strong mother.

1416
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:47,724
And we,

1417
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,230
we are the sisters you never wanted.

1418
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:54,732
- [gunfire in distance]
- [man screaming outside]

1419
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,568
They'll take you too.

1420
01:25:58,903 --> 01:25:59,904
