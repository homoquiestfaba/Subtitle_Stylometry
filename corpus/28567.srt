1
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:48,000
Take a break guys.
Grab a cup of coffee.

2
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:51,557
Let's go!

3
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:04,878
This is going to Section 3.
Section 3? But...

4
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,596
I said Section 3!
But it says in the papers...

5
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:13,044
There is a mistake in the papers.
But lieutenant Melnikov said...

6
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,676
We got around 200 ton
of nuclear weapons here.

7
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,601
Less than half has been disarmed.
Continue.

8
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,324
Go!

9
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,597
Barabanov?
Yes.

10
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:23,280
There will be 12 men on the slegdecrew.
All has been handpicked by my people.

11
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:27,997
They've promised stable weather. It will
take them ten days to reach the border.

12
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:31,318
Ten days? Very well.

13
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:35,719
That will give the President
enough time to panic.

14
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,924
The President?
Yes

15
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:44,240
He plays an important role 
though he doesn't know it himself.

16
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:48,206
The leading role for once.

17
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:51,518
Barabanov!

18
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:03,004
Eat.
Great!

19
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:18,600
How do we find them?
There's a shitload here.

20
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:22,475
Take this one. Check
every single one of them.

21
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:32,121
What is the password?

22
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,483
What is the password?
I don't know.

23
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:43,726

24
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,918

25
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:54,444

26
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:59,043

27
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:10,404

28
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,000

29
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,278
Come over here. I found them.

30
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,560
Cheers for Åke and Anna.

31
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:17,843
Next time it might be your turn?
Perhaps. I haven't dared to ask.

32
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:28,563
Excuse me.
I think this dance is mine.

33
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:32,959

34
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:35,561

35
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:40,278

36
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,358

37
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:46,122

38
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:50,166

39
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:53,364

40
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:56,996

41
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,716

42
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:06,120

43
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,198

44
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,275

45
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,680

46
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,766
Hey, Tessie.

47
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:31,681
Did I say something wrong?

49
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,076
A very nervous person enters the room.
He is not Åke's cousin from Åbo.

51
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:50,444
Then he says a few things to you guys from OP5.
What is this? A wedding or a conspiration?

52
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:53,360
Answer!

53
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:58,237
He, who was here, works for
a organization, called ClA.

54
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:02,206
You are under suspicion for being a spy.
Oh no.

55
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,245
You are caught.
What if I confess?

56
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:08,239
Doesn't matter.
Punishment is the same.

57
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:12,684
Do I get a last wish?
Yes. You have 20 minutes.

58
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:26,319
OPERATIONAL HEADQUARTER
OP 5

59
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:30,036
Hello!
Per Molander, Prime minister's...

60
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:35,759
ID card...
I'm here twice a week.

61
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,483
They're awating me.
That much rush there is not.

62
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:48,281

63
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:51,598

64
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:57,000

65
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:00,875

66
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,846

67
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,284

68
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:14,316

69
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,717

70
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:21,846

71
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:27,524

72
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:31,680

73
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:36,079

74
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:41,002

75
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:45,524

76
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:48,280

77
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:51,439

78
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,519

79
00:10:54,607 --> 00:11:00,398

80
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:04,196

81
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,482

82
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,637

83
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:13,881

84
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,965

85
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:30,079
Please be seated.

86
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:34,957
We will only need 4 people
besides Stålhandske and myself.

87
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:38,357
You... you...

88
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,439
... you and you.

89
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:46,760
You are on reserve.
Please leave the room now.

90
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:56,676
Someone wishes to smuggle a nuclear
weapon from Russia and through Sweden.

91
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:00,316
We are to find and eliminate
them inside Russia.

92
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:05,401
This is Top-Secret. You will meet 
well trained and equipped resistance.

93
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:11,357
So it's combat rediness,
as soon as we hit the ground. Questions?

94
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:54,076
We will assume they have heatseeking devices.
Wear snowsuit till we have established contact.

95
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,123
And after that reflectionsuit.

96
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,926
If I do not wish to be seen,
I will not be seen.

97
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,682
I just need to know,
where the hell they are.

98
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,043
THE RUSSIAN TUNDRA

99
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,804
We will camp here.

100
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:24,441

101
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,995

102
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,199

103
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,839
The area has been secured.
Good.

104
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:46,164
Find him, but quickly.
Get him back.

105
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,958
Who is in charge?

106
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:00,481

107
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,440

108
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:13,716

109
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,245

110
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:24,162
Damnit!

111
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,205

112
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:32,439

113
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,917
What's your name?
Kolja! Kolja Mordavin!

114
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:47,603
Good, Kolja. Now tell me,
who will have the missile.

115
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,360
I do not know! I do not know!

116
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:55,646
You are gonna turn over a nuclear
missile to the first guy you meet?

117
00:18:55,727 --> 00:19:01,597
It seems a bit too easy, right?
Think, Kolja, think.

118
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:05,236
The password is Washington. That's all.

119
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,797
I know nothing else!

120
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:21,124
Execute them all.

121
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:30,360
Do as your order tells you!

122
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,600
Shit! Damnit!

123
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:42,837
Collect all personal belongings,
which is not burnable.

124
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:23,675
No, I do not wish to die.
Please don't. Please?

125
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:06,836
They were all carrying 50.000 dollars.
What to do with the money?

126
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,034
Burn them.
What?

127
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:27,273
He's dead.

128
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:32,306
I fell through the ice with
the bastard... and lost my skies.

129
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:36,436
Good. And the body?
It was impossible to get him out

130
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:40,829
The stream must have taken 
him several kilometers away.

131
00:24:18,477 --> 00:24:23,426

132
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:29,786

133
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:35,227

134
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:12,230
It was a nuclear missile.
You scare me.

135
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:16,515
A russian produced SS20,
1,5 megaton, completely intact.

136
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:20,795
So why did the "terrorists" have
nothing to defend themselves with?

137
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:25,951
They were dragging a nuclear weapon and
a fortune, but not a weapon.

138
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:31,828
You did a good job. The missile
has been located and secured.

139
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:36,627
Fine.
Then we can all sleep safely tonight.

140
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:40,073
Have you not been home?

141
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:43,035
Do you need anything?
This.

142
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:49,829
No sign of anyone waiting,
on the mentioned meeting spot.

143
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:58,789
It was never intended, for the
missile to cross the border.

144
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:09,156
How do I get in? You just
need to have your head with you.

145
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:12,593
What does he mean by that?

146
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:32,432
You said he loved toys,
but that is too much.

147
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:36,874
In Carls case that border
is fine as hair.

148
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,907
We don't know what to do,
with these rooms.

149
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:51,069
Carl says he wishes,
to keep them as they are.

150
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,990
He has secret plans properly.

151
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:59,276
They are beautiful. I'm considering
to begin working from home.

152
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:13,827
Anna asks all the time.
Have you told Tessie anything?

153
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:18,707
Concerning what?
The trip. What did you say?

154
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:25,316
The truth: Lots of snow, fucking cold,
tons of meetings, and then we went home.

155
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:29,993
Did she believe it?
No, she is too smart for that.

156
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,195
It doesn't look good at all
for you, Carl.

157
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:50,829
It is your turn.

158
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:55,228
I'm going now.
Yes.

159
00:27:56,357 --> 00:28:00,714
Great Britain attacks...
Nothern Europe.

160
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:04,836
Well damn it,
it's a conspiracy.

161
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,876
You are somewhat paranoid.
Your damn right I am.

162
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:12,791
Why you want to play?
You loose and get mad.

163
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:17,587
I don't get...
I'm focused!

164
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:25,514
Statistically I should win soon.
Statistically you should be dead.

165
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:34,672
LULEAA, NOTHERN SWEDEN

166
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:25,748
It was homicide.

167
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:32,595
The chemical test showed
no signs of alcohol or drugs.

168
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:38,832
But instead a noticeably 
high concentration of syccinykolin.

169
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:42,193
Sushi... say what?
Syccinykolin.

170
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:45,235
It's another word for curare.

171
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,354
The russian border guards has faxed.

172
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:52,396
We can exclude everyone,
except maybe Matti Leppinen.

173
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:54,832
Finish passport, resident of Murmansk.

174
00:29:54,917 --> 00:30:01,356
He crossed the border to Finland
same day as Holma was killed.

175
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:07,785
Two days later he buys a one-way 
airplane ticket from Göteborg to Murmansk.

176
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,549
The 20th.
Yes.

177
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:15,389

178
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:18,469
What happend?
I can't say.

179
00:30:18,557 --> 00:30:22,596

180
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:25,396

181
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,955
Was is this circus I
was going here for?

182
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:33,552
I just heard it myself. Congratulations.

183
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:38,950
I hope you have a good reason.
You are to see a weird request.

184
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:44,589
I can't accept the medal.
It causes only problems to refuse.

185
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,349
Come. I want to show you this.

186
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:52,828
I haven't been able to forget
what you said when you returned.

187
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,466
Rune Jansson.

188
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:02,395
Give me the http address.

189
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:05,628
You are permitted to go up there
and find out what it is.

190
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:09,551

191
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:14,995

192
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:20,231

193
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,911

194
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:30,187

195
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,393

196
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:40,037
Unusual to kill with curare.
Perhaps not.

197
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:42,995
No, but it is out here in the country.

198
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:47,514
I read,
that KGB used it as a gimmick.

199
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:50,430
This thing with curare, that is.
Alright.

200
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:56,513
We have calculated the size, value,
and origin of the cargo.

201
00:31:56,597 --> 00:32:02,354
What has been smuggled out of
Russia that is to kill for?

202
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:05,713
Caviar, weapons?

203
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:14,308
But the combination of caviar 
and curare doesn't sound likely.

204
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:20,626
Weapons then?
Yes. But it's pure speculation.

205
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:27,429
But that is what you got to do, in
such a situation -- speculate.

206
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:31,556
Of course.
So we'll keep doing that.

207
00:32:31,637 --> 00:32:34,071
Answer following:

208
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:41,188
Is it possible, that russian nuclear
weapons are smuggled through Sweden?

209
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:45,065
Unlikely. 
But not impossible?

210
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:50,390
No, but as said unlikely.
But what could it then be?

211
00:32:50,477 --> 00:32:56,109
They have hardly smuggled
cloudberry from Tjernobyl.

212
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:59,835
Was that all?
Yes.

213
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:08,631
Just one more thing...

214
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:13,586
We have arrested a suspect.
He's a well-known smuggler up here.

215
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:16,430
He lacks an alibi
and is under suspicion.

216
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:22,706
He has told an amazing story,
I think you should hear.

217
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:39,108
It's him!
That's the man from the tundra!

218
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:44,510
He can provide me with an alibi! So
talk with him! It's me, Juha!

219
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:48,795
Ask him! He saved my life!
I didn't kill anyone!

220
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:52,506
Shut up! Get him down!
Fucked up assholes!

221
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,987
What the hell is this? What?

222
00:33:56,077 --> 00:34:01,629
Would you care to tell me
what is going on here?

223
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:06,547
I got to talk with him in private.

224
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,673
You may participate in the interrogation.

225
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:14,468
but you can't takeover the 
interrogetion of my suspects.

226
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:19,506
He's mainsuspect in a homicidecase.

227
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:25,229
He has persistantly claimed to have met
a swedish parachute soldier

228
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,547
on the russian tundra.

229
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:32,313
Five minutes ago it sounded like
the world's most incredible story.

230
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:35,195
Now I'm not so damn
certain no more.

231
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:39,190
Are here all the documents?
He's a homicide suspect!

232
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,155
Not any more. There's his alibi.

233
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:45,229
Is this some kind of fucking trick?

234
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:52,427
I can guarantee you he was not in
Sweden, when the murder was committed.

235
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,754
Okay, okay. Then I'll release the prisoner.

236
00:34:56,837 --> 00:35:00,796
Arrest him again.
For what?

237
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:05,348
According to paragraph 2 in 2. chapter
in the State Secret Act

238
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:11,785
everything he's done in the last
30 days are of national security.

239
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,949
LULEAA LUFTHAVN

240
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,667
You know what your charges are.

241
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:43,592
An intern investigation decides,
if it leads to prosecution or not.

242
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:48,034
Was there any doubt of
the operations nature?

243
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:53,111
No. I made a decision, which
in the situation seemed correct.

244
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:55,711
You admit insubordination?

245
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:58,311
Is that term correct?

246
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:04,029
I made a decision, that I in the 
same situation would make again.

247
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:07,871
With that decision
you threat national security.

248
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:12,951
In addition to that you place your
commander and the groups life in danger.

249
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:17,189
You must have known that.
Or what?

250
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:22,467
So? Or what?!

251
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:28,789
Yes, I was aware of that.
Still you lead the man escape.

252
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:32,506
A terrorist with information
of our actions.

253
00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:38,593
Terrorist? The man smuggles
fox fur, damn it! An amateur!

254
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:44,707
Why didn't you execute the man,
as you were ordered?

255
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:51,672
From now on I will only answer
questions from Hamilton.

256
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:55,716
Wont he show me enough respect
to hear my explanation in the same room

257
00:36:55,797 --> 00:37:01,315
Can he not show me that respect
then you can go to hell!

258
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:04,628
Give him his dismissal.

259
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:22,872
One thing you shall know:

260
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:27,189
As leader of the organistation
it's still my call

261
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:31,111
who leaves and who stays.
Is that clear?

262
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:34,792
Yes, of course. Sorry.

263
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,869
There's another missile.

264
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:43,236
It was taken out of Russia and
on through Sweden.

265
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:47,151
The left behind truck in Luleaa...

266
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:49,910
There was radioactivity in the hold.

267
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:52,306
The truck driver was killed with curare.

268
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:58,108
The Dollars in the glove compartement was
from same serie as Juha Saaronen's.

269
00:37:58,197 --> 00:38:02,236
So the truck driver and 
the episode on the tundra

270
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:06,356
are connected.
They origin from the same source.

271
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:11,909
All traces lead back to Russia.
To Murmansk, to Severomorsk.

272
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:14,989
But now I don't dare to trust the CIA.

273
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:18,593
I need information 
straight from Russia.

274
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:23,990
From one who I trust and
who trusts me.

275
00:38:34,307 --> 00:38:37,344
You admit insubordination?

276
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:40,100
Is that term correct?

277
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:46,023
I made a decision, that I, in that
same situation would make again.

278
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:53,537
I made a decision, that I, in that
same situation would make again.

279
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:58,337
I made a decision, that I, in that
same situation would make again...

280
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:01,539
Hi.

281
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:04,744
Where the hell have you been?
At work.

282
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:08,661
Right till now?
Yes.

283
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:14,944
When did you start to
work till 10:30pm? Uh?

284
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:20,579
Why dont you pick up your celluar?
Relax. What happened?

285
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:31,582
You have to answer when I call.
I worry. Don't you understand that?

286
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,943
Anna called today.

287
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:37,666
Can you say what happened?
No.

288
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:41,217
What is Åke charged of?

289
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:44,777
I can't say.
You know that. But...

290
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:49,383
Anna spoke about insubordination.
So talk to her, if it...

291
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,300
I'm asking you!

292
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:59,941
What happened in Russia?
This is insane.

293
00:40:00,027 --> 00:40:04,703
You don't sleep at night.
You are like a maniac.

294
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:10,545
Who do you really work for?
Carl!

295
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:15,657
I love you.

296
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,626
And I love you. You know that.

297
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:27,459
Yeah...
I guess that's what I wanted to say.

298
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,943
Was that it?
Yes.

299
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:35,906
Aren't you gonna ask anything else?
Like what?

300
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:40,344
Like why I dont sleep at night.

301
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:44,261
You are not interested.....

302
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:49,462
You're gonna tell me if I ask?
No.

303
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:54,025
No, uh?
It has nothing with this to do!

304
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:58,897
What is it then related to?
You asking.

305
00:41:08,387 --> 00:41:11,345
Are you bringing Rune Jansson
with you to Murmansk?

306
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,816
No, he's bringing me.

307
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:19,857
He's to investigate the murder of Lasse
Holma. Officially I'm his assistant.

308
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:25,622
MURMANSK, RUSSIA

309
00:41:37,187 --> 00:41:42,864

310
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:45,097

311
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:47,417

312
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:04,180

313
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:09,141

314
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:13,664

315
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:17,660

316
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:43,100

317
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:46,259

318
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,578

319
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:55,697

320
00:42:56,627 --> 00:43:00,939

321
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,783

322
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:26,425

323
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:30,944

324
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,985

325
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:38,060

326
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:42,823

327
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:49,859

328
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:52,666

329
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:57,263

330
00:43:57,347 --> 00:44:00,100
Am I to listen to this story?
Of course.

331
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:06,296
I've got a hunch, you're telling the
Russians one story and me another.

332
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:12,223

333
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:18,655

334
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:22,945

335
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:27,657

336
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:32,263

337
00:44:32,347 --> 00:44:35,339

338
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:39,898

339
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:46,745

340
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:49,864

341
00:44:49,947 --> 00:44:52,700

342
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:55,585

343
00:44:55,667 --> 00:45:02,345

344
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:05,101

345
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:08,542
Bingo!

346
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:14,942

347
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:17,302

348
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:22,142

349
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:24,218

350
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:43,619

351
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,585

352
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:50,899

353
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:53,785

354
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:57,303

355
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:02,461

356
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:06,381

357
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:10,699

358
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:15,338

359
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:19,818

360
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:27,065

361
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:31,982

362
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:36,936

363
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,621

364
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:44,986

365
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:52,015

366
00:46:52,107 --> 00:46:55,941

367
00:46:56,027 --> 00:46:59,906

368
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,217

369
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:07,461

370
00:47:09,147 --> 00:47:11,866

371
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:16,901

372
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:20,218

373
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:25,859

374
00:47:25,947 --> 00:47:31,419

375
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:37,901

376
00:47:39,227 --> 00:47:41,297

377
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:44,902

378
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:50,983

379
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:57,736

380
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:07,576

381
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:17,982

382
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:23,858

383
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:29,579

384
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:32,943

385
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:00,623
You say you talk Swedish?
Yes.

386
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:04,495
I'm chief of police 
Rune Jansson from Luleaa.

387
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:08,660
I've been counting on recording
this conversation on tape.

388
00:49:09,427 --> 00:49:13,056
If just the shit works.

389
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:18,146
Sorry.

390
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:23,620
You're under suspicion for assitance
in the murder of Lasse Holma.

391
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:27,586
What do you have to say to that?
It wasn't me.

392
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,945
You confessed it to 
my Russian colleagues.

393
00:49:32,027 --> 00:49:34,302
Those sons of bitches are crazy!

394
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:41,782
The homicide was in Sweden. The 
question is, where you should be tried.

395
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:44,427
Here in Murmansk or in Haparanda.

396
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:48,500
If you are tried in Sweden,
you'll be sentenced to life.

397
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:51,943
And if you brush your teeth every
night, it'll be 7~8 years.

398
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:59,263
Here in Murmansk you'll get a 
bullet. Got it?

399
00:49:59,347 --> 00:50:02,066
Yes.

400
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:05,457
You where there when Holma was killed?
Yes.

401
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,937
You know what happened?
It wasn't me.

402
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:11,541
It was Ilja.

403
00:50:15,507 --> 00:50:19,898
Ilja Aleksandrov. He killed him.

404
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:31,336

405
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:37,582

406
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:43,742
Samuel Ulfsson, please.

407
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:48,025
Ulfsson here.
I'm straight from the interrogation.

408
00:50:48,107 --> 00:50:50,985
Just as we thought it was one missile.

409
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:56,983
It was loaded to Amalthea in
Varberg, nationality is unknown.

410
00:50:57,067 --> 00:51:02,460
Probably Libyan.

411
00:51:02,547 --> 00:51:05,505

412
00:51:05,587 --> 00:51:09,580
I'll call you back.

413
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:25,425
We have traced Amalthea to Rotterdam.

414
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:28,579
She has changed identity
and disappeared.

415
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:33,297
Does Carl know of this development?
I haven't called him.

416
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:36,424
Good, I will.

417
00:51:38,187 --> 00:51:42,021

418
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:48,740

419
00:51:48,827 --> 00:51:53,025

420
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:58,306

421
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:03,222

422
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:08,381

423
00:52:20,547 --> 00:52:25,337
Grab his briefcase!
Look at me, you motherfucker!

424
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:30,182
Go to Hell!
Get him in the building. Now!

425
00:52:36,707 --> 00:52:40,177
This way.

426
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:47,699
You rat.

427
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:53,180
Major Barabanov, You speak english.

428
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:58,387
The Swedes have some questions.
I'm a KGB officer.

429
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:04,426

430
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:07,260

431
00:53:07,347 --> 00:53:12,102

432
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:14,655

433
00:53:14,827 --> 00:53:21,062

434
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:27,704

435
00:53:29,267 --> 00:53:32,259

436
00:53:33,907 --> 00:53:37,377

437
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:44,500
Mr. Aleksandrov or Barabanov...
Go to Hell!

438
00:53:53,227 --> 00:53:59,257
I dont think, this is working.
Yes, it works. Relax.

439
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:03,546
See...

440
00:54:04,227 --> 00:54:08,618
Hello, Mr. General.
Oh, Hello!

441
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:15,180
Yes... I've heard, you have taken...
what's his name? Aleksandrov.

442
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:18,225
Yes, after a Finn's description.

443
00:54:18,307 --> 00:54:24,860
Has he helped you with
the investigation?

444
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:29,577
Not the Finn, Aleksandrov.
Yes, quite a bit.

445
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:35,776
I see. Perhaps you'd like,
for us to take care of him?

446
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:40,736
Thank you, Mr. General. It's friendly
of you. But there is no need for that.

447
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:44,820
Let me know, if I can help.
Thanks.

448
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:53,865

449
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:57,019

450
00:54:59,307 --> 00:55:04,984

451
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,627

452
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:12,144

453
00:55:12,227 --> 00:55:17,779

454
00:55:17,867 --> 00:55:22,258

455
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:28,502

456
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:32,899

457
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:36,946
I've got evidence!
Get him to the car. Quickly.

458
00:55:37,547 --> 00:55:40,619

459
00:55:41,987 --> 00:55:44,979

460
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:49,504

461
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:55,184

462
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:57,827

463
00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:03,857

464
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:07,860

465
01:02:54,328 --> 01:02:57,843
Good Evening.

466
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:13,760
Okay?

467
01:03:21,408 --> 01:03:24,923
May I...? Thank You.

468
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:28,840
Good Evening.

469
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:55,000

470
01:03:55,088 --> 01:04:00,526

471
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:21,078
Everything alright?

472
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:29,644
Where the hell have you been?
Been? Me?

473
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:32,765

474
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:35,840

475
01:04:36,888 --> 01:04:39,482

476
01:04:39,568 --> 01:04:46,087

477
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:55,037

478
01:04:55,128 --> 01:04:58,677

479
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:03,880
Damn Idiot!
Don't be so haughty!

480
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:08,837
You want names?!
Fellinskij! Japasvilij!

481
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:12,443
Glusjenko! Rotenko!

482
01:05:12,528 --> 01:05:17,602
You wanted names! You got them.
They have completely left you out.

483
01:05:17,688 --> 01:05:22,637
They let you rot here and take 
all the money you earned them!

484
01:05:22,728 --> 01:05:27,722

485
01:05:27,808 --> 01:05:32,324

486
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:37,436

487
01:05:37,528 --> 01:05:41,203

488
01:05:41,288 --> 01:05:46,681

489
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:49,646
Excuse me?
He likes your apartment.

490
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:54,358

491
01:05:55,248 --> 01:06:00,242
I'm a KGB officer.
You have no right to interrogate me!

492
01:06:00,328 --> 01:06:04,207

493
01:06:04,288 --> 01:06:07,086

494
01:06:08,008 --> 01:06:14,117

495
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:19,798

496
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:24,121
Okay.

497
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:29,643
Okay, Mr. Major. Go.

498
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:32,765
Go, go.

499
01:06:32,848 --> 01:06:35,840
Get out!

500
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:39,722
Go, I tell you!

500
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:39,722
Go on I said!

501
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:44,086
What if I tell?
Tell them everything?

502
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:49,765

503
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:54,842

504
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,204

505
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:07,202

506
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:10,678

507
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:15,364

508
01:07:16,888 --> 01:07:20,244

509
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:23,320

510
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,805

511
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:35,157

512
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:38,843

513
01:07:41,088 --> 01:07:46,037

514
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:49,279
Could you tell me
where to find Mordavins office?

515
01:07:49,368 --> 01:07:53,077
Down there and to the left? Thanks.

516
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:56,843

517
01:07:56,928 --> 01:08:00,557

518
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:05,563

519
01:08:16,768 --> 01:08:19,760

520
01:08:23,608 --> 01:08:27,283
What's wrong?

521
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:36,759
Get a hold of the coroner too.

522
01:09:37,928 --> 01:09:41,682

523
01:09:41,768 --> 01:09:46,284
He died of a heart attack.
Have a look at this.

524
01:09:47,728 --> 01:09:49,764
Oh my god.

525
01:09:49,848 --> 01:09:53,602

526
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:58,398

527
01:09:58,488 --> 01:10:01,798

528
01:10:01,888 --> 01:10:04,356

529
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:15,244

530
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:22,521

531
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:25,486

532
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:31,564

533
01:10:34,248 --> 01:10:37,923

534
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:23,761

535
01:11:23,848 --> 01:11:27,682

536
01:11:27,768 --> 01:11:30,362

537
01:11:30,448 --> 01:11:33,167

538
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:36,001

539
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:39,797

540
01:11:39,888 --> 01:11:45,804

541
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:53,037

542
01:11:53,128 --> 01:11:56,245

543
01:11:56,328 --> 01:11:58,444

544
01:11:58,528 --> 01:12:03,158

545
01:12:03,248 --> 01:12:08,800

546
01:12:08,888 --> 01:12:13,086

547
01:12:13,168 --> 01:12:17,798

548
01:12:17,888 --> 01:12:20,641

549
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:23,367

550
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:29,239

551
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:36,482

552
01:12:41,568 --> 01:12:44,560

553
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:55,718

554
01:12:55,808 --> 01:12:59,357
They wont pay to
anyone but Hawkins.

555
01:12:59,448 --> 01:13:02,758
Only Hawkins can wind up deal.

556
01:13:02,848 --> 01:13:06,045
The swedes have him.
We have to send someone else.

557
01:13:06,128 --> 01:13:12,522
No. It's only the american
who knows where the tritium is.

558
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:20,086
You have Barabanov
to thank for that stupidity.

559
01:13:20,168 --> 01:13:25,003
It must be Hawkins.
Damn it.

560
01:13:25,088 --> 01:13:29,843
Make sure that he gets the bomb.
Very well. And Hamilton?

561
01:13:29,928 --> 01:13:34,206
Hamilton should have been killed
several years ago.

562
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:41,185

563
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:09,471
Any problems?
He's one hot-headed little bastard.

564
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:19,388

565
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:22,065

566
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:26,269

567
01:14:27,271 --> 01:14:32,743

568
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:36,744

569
01:14:36,831 --> 01:14:41,029

570
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:46,823

571
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:51,826

572
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:57,349

573
01:14:57,431 --> 01:15:00,468

574
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:03,349

575
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:08,266

576
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:11,343

577
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:22,781

578
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:26,102

579
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:30,264
It's absurd letting Hawkins
dictate us the conditions.

580
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:35,379
I think
we should meet all his demands.

581
01:15:35,471 --> 01:15:40,704
In that far out belief he can stay
and enjoy the lovely Swedish house.

582
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:44,864
Meanwhile the CIA locate the missile
and disarm it.

583
01:15:44,951 --> 01:15:51,220
The government agrees Carl. As the situation
is at the moment, it's all about...

584
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:54,462
Sam?

585
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,543
Hello? Can you...?
Carl?

586
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:03,305
I can't... Can you hear me?

587
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:10,779
Fix it.

588
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:15,064
What's going on?

589
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:29,067
What the hell is going on?
Who are you?!

590
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:09,987
What do we do now, Sam?
What's the next move?

591
01:17:10,071 --> 01:17:13,859
It's no longer our problem.
USA has taken over.

592
01:17:13,951 --> 01:17:16,511
6. fleet has set course towards Libya.

593
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:20,140
CIA is tailing Hawkins
and expect to find the bomb.

594
01:17:20,231 --> 01:17:22,665
That's what USA have been hoping for.

595
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:27,063
Bombing Libya to pieces in their
hunt for a nuclear missile.

596
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:30,064
And if they get a direct hit...

597
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:32,870
For Sweden the case is closed.

598
01:17:32,951 --> 01:17:36,990
Go home and sleep.
That's an order.

599
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:48,790
There has been put a lid on, right?
Nobody can hear about it.

600
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:52,663
Ulfsson!

601
01:17:54,991 --> 01:18:01,829
600. Russian, who after a weak start
came 3rd after Torrence and Ottey.

602
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:07,709
I can't keep up.
It's going to fast.

603
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,348
You take it.

604
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:18,786
No. Forget it.
No, I'm taking it.

605
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:28,947
It's Stenhamra.
Hey, Åke. It has been a while.

606
01:18:29,111 --> 01:18:31,830
It's Åke.

607
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:38,462
Could he call you back?

608
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:41,145
Yes. Yes.

609
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:49,590
Okay. Give my regards to Anna.
Okay. Bye bye.

610
01:18:50,711 --> 01:18:53,430
What was it about?

611
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:57,470
Hawkins escaped the CIA in London.

612
01:18:59,631 --> 01:19:04,625
What else did he say?
If you want to talk to him, call him.

613
01:19:04,711 --> 01:19:08,784
For gods sake... Anna can
forgive him. I can forgive him.

614
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:11,783
An intire World can,
but not his best friend.

615
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,101
What do you forgive?
I don't know.

616
01:19:14,191 --> 01:19:19,663
No, but it sounds great.
What can't you forgive him for?

617
01:19:21,431 --> 01:19:25,583
Something you will
never be able to understand.

618
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:31,023
I can't explain it,
but it's...

619
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:34,626
It's an entire other world.

620
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:39,501
Another universe. Something
you can't even begin to grasp.

621
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:43,948
How do you know?
What could he have done that's so...

622
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:50,140
... unforgiveable, that you would
let it destroy our love?

623
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:02,307
I gave an order,
for 12 men to be executed.

624
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:07,465
Before we burned the bodies
we cut them up with a chainsaw.

625
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:11,260
I cut them up with a chainsaw.

626
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:17,221
It's best parting the limbs from
the body. They burn better that way.

627
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:21,748
Nothing kept me back.

628
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:28,826
One of... the bodies I cut up...

629
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,869
... was... He...

630
01:20:32,471 --> 01:20:39,309
Strange enough he was alive. He was 
trembling. The entire body was quivering.

631
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:46,103
I had to get out my gun. I didn't
know where the heck it was.

632
01:20:46,191 --> 01:20:49,308
I dropped it in the snow.

633
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,825
It was sticky from the blod.

634
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:56,499
Then I put a bullet through his brains.

635
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:18,183
Officially it was an assignment
that never took place.

636
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:22,469
We had to eliminate
a terroristgroup inside Russia.

637
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:26,226
We couldn't leave any clues.
No witnesses.

638
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:28,984
Åke knew about it too.

639
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:34,145
Everything was planned. Gone through
every little detail.

640
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:36,870
But still...

641
01:21:36,951 --> 01:21:39,226
... he lets one of them run.

642
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:46,308
By that he threatened not only me, but
the entire group. He broked a deal...

643
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:49,827
... and put everyone in danger.

644
01:21:49,911 --> 01:21:56,066
The problem is, how do I
convince anyone that...

645
01:21:56,151 --> 01:22:00,861
... it was wrong letting one live.
That it was a failure to disobey an order.

646
01:22:00,951 --> 01:22:03,784
Who are you Carl?

647
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:08,149
Who would do that? Can't you grasp,
that such a man would explode?

648
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:11,303
I don't know them and don't
know if they deserve...

649
01:22:11,391 --> 01:22:15,179
Who would deserve something like that?

650
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:19,344
It's totally uncomprehensible.
We were given an order.

651
01:22:19,431 --> 01:22:25,063
If one of your superiors,
told you to murder me...

652
01:22:25,151 --> 01:22:28,143
... would you then do it?

653
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:07,309

654
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:10,349

655
01:23:10,431 --> 01:23:13,548

656
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:17,465

657
01:23:17,551 --> 01:23:20,543

658
01:23:20,631 --> 01:23:23,907

659
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:32,863

660
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:39,265

661
01:23:42,511 --> 01:23:45,503

662
01:23:45,591 --> 01:23:48,708

663
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:52,864

664
01:23:52,951 --> 01:23:56,830

665
01:23:56,911 --> 01:24:00,187

666
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:03,343

667
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:06,980

668
01:24:07,071 --> 01:24:12,304

669
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:16,188

670
01:24:16,271 --> 01:24:20,264

671
01:24:31,711 --> 01:24:35,067

672
01:24:58,431 --> 01:25:03,107
What are you doing, Carl?
Excuse me?

673
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:06,581
Orders from the highest place.
Your leaving for Tunis.

674
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:09,583
Yes sir... Tunis.

675
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:16,066
I don't know whether to be irritated
or impressed? Why are you doing it?

676
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:19,029
Therapy.

677
01:25:21,591 --> 01:25:23,900
Good.

678
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:26,459
Oh yes, there was one more thing.

679
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:29,623
This means you'll be working
closely together with USA.

680
01:25:29,711 --> 01:25:33,067
You know, PLO shoots the head of me,
if they think that.

681
01:25:33,151 --> 01:25:38,179
Then make sure they don't think that.
All contact with USA is through me.

682
01:25:38,271 --> 01:25:42,822
Untill the bomb is located.
After that you're on your own.

683
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:46,267
"You"?
What?

684
01:25:46,351 --> 01:25:51,823
You said "You".
Yes, you're not going alone.

685
01:25:56,191 --> 01:26:00,662
And it's not up for discussion.

686
01:26:00,751 --> 01:26:04,027
Sam?
Therapy.

687
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:39,943
Good luck.

688
01:26:55,631 --> 01:27:01,820

689
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:15,749

690
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:21,861

691
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:27,105

692
01:27:27,791 --> 01:27:32,103

693
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:26,827

694
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:30,870

695
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:33,829

696
01:28:33,991 --> 01:28:37,950

697
01:28:38,711 --> 01:28:43,785

698
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:46,829

699
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:51,348

700
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:55,219

701
01:28:55,311 --> 01:29:02,547
He wants to know if we can help.
Else anything can happen.

702
01:29:02,631 --> 01:29:05,429
Can we trust him?

703
01:29:05,511 --> 01:29:10,221

704
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:36,069
No.

705
01:29:38,711 --> 01:29:41,862
Excuse me? No.

706
01:29:41,951 --> 01:29:46,229
May I call you back? Exactly.

707
01:29:47,871 --> 01:29:52,661
Yes?
I've gone through the equipment.

708
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:58,462
Everything is as we wanted, except
these transmitters, I found.

709
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:07,942
Good.

710
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:14,139
PLO has accepted.
It's tommorrow morning at 05.00.

711
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:43,940

712
01:30:58,071 --> 01:30:59,948

713
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:03,944

714
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:13,700

715
01:31:18,901 --> 01:31:25,056

716
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:29,896

717
01:31:48,901 --> 01:31:51,779

718
01:31:51,861 --> 01:31:58,460
From here we cross the desert to the base,
where the bomb is... There!

719
01:31:59,341 --> 01:32:03,619

720
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:06,693

721
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:20,293

722
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:25,893

723
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:31,700

724
01:32:31,781 --> 01:32:36,696

725
01:32:36,781 --> 01:32:42,094

726
01:32:44,221 --> 01:32:46,940
What the hell is this?

727
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:50,570
Hey! Hold on.

728
01:32:54,661 --> 01:32:58,370
I'm allergic.

729
01:32:58,461 --> 01:33:03,615
To horses, yes. These are
camels. You'll take the white thing.

730
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:37,100

731
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:39,854

732
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:43,854

733
01:33:43,941 --> 01:33:48,173

734
01:34:18,341 --> 01:34:22,493

735
01:34:22,581 --> 01:34:24,412

736
01:34:24,501 --> 01:34:29,256

737
01:34:29,341 --> 01:34:32,413

738
01:34:47,941 --> 01:34:51,775

739
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:57,738

740
01:34:57,821 --> 01:35:00,494

741
01:35:00,581 --> 01:35:05,097

742
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:09,572

743
01:35:09,661 --> 01:35:14,416

744
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:16,890

745
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:20,337

746
01:35:28,781 --> 01:35:33,901
Carl, take a look at these.
This can only mean one thing.

747
01:35:39,141 --> 01:35:45,057

748
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:48,531
Stop! On the ground!

749
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:39,413
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

750
01:36:39,581 --> 01:36:46,692
They forced me to it.
They're gonna kill me.

751
01:36:46,781 --> 01:36:53,129
I trusted you!
Sorry. Sorry.

752
01:36:53,301 --> 01:36:56,418
Please forgive me.

753
01:37:15,101 --> 01:37:18,980

754
01:37:19,061 --> 01:37:24,294

755
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:27,339

756
01:37:32,381 --> 01:37:35,612

757
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:39,012

758
01:37:39,101 --> 01:37:42,298

759
01:37:45,581 --> 01:37:49,335

760
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:54,620

761
01:37:54,701 --> 01:37:57,613

762
01:37:59,461 --> 01:38:03,010

763
01:38:03,101 --> 01:38:07,140

764
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:09,974
That's Carl.
No it has to be Åke.

765
01:38:10,061 --> 01:38:15,215
No Åke is in the back.
The one with the lover.

766
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:18,771
71 or 82?
Take the 82.

767
01:38:20,141 --> 01:38:24,259
Oh, it's third time this week!

768
01:38:41,341 --> 01:38:45,653
Stop it, Brännström!
I didn't know you were here, I'm sorry!

769
01:38:45,741 --> 01:38:49,336
I'm going home now.
Yes... Sorry.

770
01:38:49,421 --> 01:38:53,130
The light is on out there.
Check the gate. It's probably the fox.

771
01:38:53,981 --> 01:38:56,620
Ulfsson.
The alarm has gone off out on Stenhamra.

772
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:59,898
Everything is clear. False Alarm.
Again?

773
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:40,897
I think, I applied for five
different jobs at once.

774
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:47,136
It was probably more... I guess
I'm longing for one at all...

775
01:39:54,901 --> 01:40:01,852
Wake up. It's bedtime.
I didn't hear the last part.

776
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:05,051

777
01:41:58,661 --> 01:42:03,416
This is their camp.
We go in when the night comes.

778
01:42:03,501 --> 01:42:07,892
This is where the bomb is.
It has to be disarmed.

779
01:42:32,421 --> 01:42:36,972

780
01:42:40,141 --> 01:42:42,371

781
01:42:45,261 --> 01:42:49,812

782
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:58,613

783
01:42:58,701 --> 01:43:02,091

784
01:43:02,181 --> 01:43:05,696

785
01:43:05,781 --> 01:43:09,774

786
01:43:11,021 --> 01:43:14,980

787
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:17,700

788
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:25,216

789
01:43:25,301 --> 01:43:30,933

790
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:35,014

791
01:43:35,101 --> 01:43:40,619

792
01:43:40,701 --> 01:43:44,819
Gør nøjagtig, hvad de siger, Tessie.
Jeg elsker dig.

793
01:43:44,901 --> 01:43:47,654
Anna er her også, Carl.

794
01:44:00,661 --> 01:44:05,815

795
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:09,974

796
01:44:10,061 --> 01:44:15,089

797
01:44:30,901 --> 01:44:34,814

798
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:38,052

799
01:44:40,741 --> 01:44:43,858

800
01:44:43,941 --> 01:44:47,616

801
01:44:47,701 --> 01:44:51,979

802
01:44:52,061 --> 01:44:55,770

803
01:44:55,861 --> 01:44:59,820

804
01:44:59,901 --> 01:45:03,735

805
01:45:04,901 --> 01:45:08,814

806
01:45:08,901 --> 01:45:12,610

807
01:45:17,181 --> 01:45:20,014
I can handle it.
Are you sure?

808
01:45:20,101 --> 01:45:23,332
Else I wouldn't say so.
Wouldn't you?

809
01:45:23,421 --> 01:45:27,096
What the hell do you mean?!
You know damn well what I mean!

810
01:45:27,181 --> 01:45:31,094

811
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:39,096

812
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:48,932
Yes there.

813
01:45:55,261 --> 01:45:58,219
Yes, Ulfsson here.
Yes.

814
01:45:58,301 --> 01:46:02,499
It's me, Sam.
Listen like you've never listened before, Sam.

815
01:46:08,861 --> 01:46:10,658

816
01:46:11,141 --> 01:46:16,693

817
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:20,817

818
01:46:20,901 --> 01:46:24,496

819
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:08,760

820
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:14,244
15 minutes... nu!

821
01:47:21,731 --> 01:47:25,360

822
01:47:29,011 --> 01:47:32,048

823
01:47:56,331 --> 01:47:59,880
After him!

824
01:48:34,251 --> 01:48:35,684

825
01:50:34,411 --> 01:50:37,403

826
01:51:58,451 --> 01:52:01,045
Everything alright?
Yes damnit.

827
01:52:01,211 --> 01:52:05,204
You've got four minutes.

828
01:52:06,771 --> 01:52:10,650
Nothing is right.
Hawkins must have modified the bomb.

829
01:52:13,971 --> 01:52:17,281

830
01:52:17,371 --> 01:52:20,283
That counts for you also.

831
01:52:20,371 --> 01:52:24,080
Not with that hand! Get out of here now!

832
01:52:24,251 --> 01:52:27,209
It's an order!

833
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:40,290

834
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:00,570

835
01:53:30,691 --> 01:53:35,890

836
01:53:38,091 --> 01:53:42,004

837
01:53:50,571 --> 01:53:55,361
Didn't you hear what I said?
You know I never obey orders.

838
