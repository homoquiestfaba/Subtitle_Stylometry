And I'm amazed you done broke down
our whole little operation.

Mm-mm-mm. So-so--

355
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:35,868
So, tell me, are you some kind of fine
criminal mastermind or something?

356
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:40,123
So we're clear, what I am is a mother
whose daughter is in trouble.

That's it.

362

- We're moving a little too fast, no?

that type of dough,

- Quadruple.
- Quadruple the money.

from anything that ties back to you.

The whole point is to remove you from

that's what you got your boys for, right??

So, how do you know Bobby?

I put him down as family.

Life can be like that sometimes.

524
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,389
Wow. Well, you know
what they say about life.

525
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,267
When life gives you lemons...

526
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,937
Make a gin and tonic and throw the lemon
on the rim for garnish.

527
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,814
Well, gimme my lemon.

531
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,868
[Brian] Yeah. This is gonna be dope.

532
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,537
Yes, it is.

533
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,126
This is gonna be business.

534
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:31,130
There's no reason business
can't have pleasure, right?

535
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:35,134
Look, I'm not here for all that.
This is a short-term deal for me.

536
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,970
I just need to make enough money
to take care of my daughter's situation

537
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,138
and I'm out.

538
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,808
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

539
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,977
- I got it.
- All right.

540
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,646
[Brian] We'll get through this together...

541
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,107
- Yeah.
- ...and do the things we need to do.

542
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,026
- You know what I mean?
- That's right.

543

- So, what's next?

544
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,121
Tre sent this.

545
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,176

Good afternoon, Your Honor.

[judge] Good afternoon.

549
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,112
Where are we on this?

550
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,115
The State's agreed to drop
all the charges against Ashley Davis.

551
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,618
In conjunction, Your Honor,
my client has agreed

552
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,787
to not sue the city
for her daughter's injuries.

553
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,539
It is with complete agreement
from all parties

554
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,460
that the officer responsible for said
injuries be terminated immediately.

555
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,921
And we're all in agreement on this?

556
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,381
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, Your Honor.

557
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,423
Good.

558
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,096
Your cut.

559
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,019
And the expenses for your colleagues.

560
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:12,689
Well, damn, Gigi. What you lookin' like
brand-new money?

561
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:16,026
- Every job has its perks, right?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,947
- Ho, shit.
- Mm-hmm.

563
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,865
Whoo.

564
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:25,119
Look like somebody gonna buy me
some brand-new shit myself.

565
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,663

- Thank you, sir.

569
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,882
Thank you.

570
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,592

Oh, my God, I'm excited!

572
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,139
Wait! How did...

[Ashley giggles]

574
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,687
Let's toast to your success.

575
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,023
Thank you.

576
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,109
- [Chris] Congratulations.
- [Gigi] I appreciate you.

- Mm-hmm.

You might be all right, man.

579
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,618
- What?
- You might be all right.

00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,707
- What up, boss?
- [Tre] <i>Checkin' in. How we lookin'?</i>

581
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,126

What the hell are y'all doing in my house?

589
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,263
Look.

590
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,850
The door was unlocked, I knocked.

591
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,644
I guess you didn't hear me come in.

592
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,314
You got my package?

593
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,317
Coming here is completely off-script.

594
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,154
Well, I'm rewriting the script.

595
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,697
And the first change

596
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,659
is Bobby's running point on all
my transactions.

597
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,327
I don't think that's a good idea.

598
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,623
Look, I don't know you. And I definitely
don't know if I can trust you.

599

Bobby's like family. I trust him.

600
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,212
Just like that?

601
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,840
Hmm. Just like that.

602
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,719
- So why the change?
- Listen.

603
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,722
Why, why don't matter.

604
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:54,518
Bobby is my man, see?
Now tell him what to do.

605
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,853

00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,143
Hi.

696
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,812
I think you need
to come take a look at this.

697
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,522

Man, look, man, you drinkin'

702
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,460
You gotta live life, motherfucker. Shit.

705
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,716
I'm gonna keep this short but sweet.

706
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:04,304
After 20 years of grinding here
at Club Symphony,

707
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,765
it's time for your boy to step on down.

708
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,100
[fans, protesting] Oh, no!

709
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:12,354
- What the hell was that?
- Man, how--

710
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,605
How we gonna run game?

711
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,483
But I don't want y'all
to get this twisted. [chuckles]

712
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,569
Because it's getting ready
to get bigger and better.

713
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:24,616
Introducing the new club owner
of Symphony.

714
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:29,037
Put your hands together
for my girl, your girl,

715
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,248

717
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:40,924
She be worth it. That motherfucker there,
it's my shit now! I like her.

718
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,342
I like her a lot.

720
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,096
Thank you, Mr. C.

721
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:49,349
I have to say in front of everyone

722
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:52,852
thank you so much for being
such a positive influence on me

723
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,980
and everyone here at this club.

724
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:58,775
I've learned so much from you and...
I'm gonna miss you.

725
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,195
Before you go...

726
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,948
I think we wanna hear you
on the mic one more time.

727
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,158

[Brian] But she didn't say anything to us.

I'm turning up with my people.

Hey, what the-- what the hell
y'all supposed to do?

I told you we need to talk.

And I told you fuck off, Gigi.
You always fuckin' with me.

Huh? I put your sorry ass on.

Hey, what's up, Brian?

796
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,515
So you bought the club, too.

797
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,518
Well, if you want big things,
you have to make big moves.

798
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,896
Yeah, well...

799
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,898
I still think you're moving too fast.

800
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:53,319
See, that's your problem right there,
Brian. You think too small.

801
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:58,658
Brian, Chris gave me
an opportunity and I took it.

802
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:02,078
Simple as that.
I'm tired of working for other people.

803
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,330
It was time for me
to have something of my own,

804
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:06,582
<i>so I took my cut and I bought the club.</i>

805

and I could do it together.</i>

807
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,593
We're supposed to be a team?

Can't you just be happy for me?

809
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,142
Hello?

810
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,643
Bye, Brian.

811
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,816
No, I'm not happy for you.

823
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:13,608
Ashley didn't tell me you were coming.

824
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:16,778
I wanted to surprise her.

825
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,821
- Oh, okay.
- And you.

826
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,451
- Maybe.
- Really?

827
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,921
I did want to bring this
to your attention, though.

828
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,255
Um...

829
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:41,219
Your new place of business is being
investigated for money laundering.

830
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:47,642
Yeah. We've been watching
these guys for a while now.

831
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:52,355
And it's starting to make me feel like...

832
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,274
your new investment might just be
another case of Gigi's bad luck.

833
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:05,243
I don't have nothing to do
with these people at all.

834
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,918
Got some new shoes, huh?

835
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,213
You know, you ever wonder why...

836
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,048
some people, no matter
how nice the shoes,

837
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:21,759
just can't keep themselves
from stepping in shit?

838
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,141
Oh, well.

839
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,935
Just consider this a courtesy call, uh...

840
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:35,523
You know, a baby head start,
you know what I'm saying?

00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,024
Okay, Greg.

- See you all later.

- [Greg] All right, be safe.

857
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,762
I almost wanna say thank you.
She was actually really--

858
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,013
[Tre] What's up, mama?

859
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:55,353
This a bad time?

860
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,689
Yeah. Yeah, this is a bad time.

00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,609
This is... where you walk off.

862
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,945
- Come again?
- Are you deaf?

863
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,905
- I said walk the fuck off.
- Who the fuck--

864
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,699
Tre, can you give us a minute, please?

865
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,369
What, you-- you know this clown?

866
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,412
Yeah, nigga, I'm her new man.
What's up?

867
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:16,207
So that's where you're getting
your new shoes from?

868
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,668
You think you're all that
'cause you fuckin' a dope boy now?

869
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:21,754
I'm gonna need a little bit more respect
coming out of your mouth, homie, for real.

870
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,591
No, this is all you need to respect,
homie, for real for real.

871
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,554
So this is how this is gonna go.

872
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:34,058
Tomorrow morning I'm filing for full legal
and physical custody of our daughter.

873
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,018
- What?
- Yes. <i>Our</i> daughter.

874
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,730
And you won't be contesting
the filing because if you do,

875
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:42,483
then I'll be compelled to tell
the court exactly why I'm petitioning,

876
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,569
and I don't think neither one of y'all
can have that.

877
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:48,030
Wow, wow!

878
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:51,534
- Greg, don't do this.
- You did this! It's already done.

879
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,704
But look at the bright side,
now you got all the time in the world

880
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:58,040
to have a whole project apartment
full of lyin' ass,

881
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:02,837
drug-dealin' ass, uneducated children
with no morals or self-respect.

882
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,594
- Tre.
- No, no, no, no.

883
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:11,429
Your fucking ex is a fed?

884
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:15,433
- Hey, don't... Don't say shit to me, man.
- Tre!

885
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,104
Tre.

886
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,609
- [door closes]
- [car starts]

887
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,776
Shit!

888
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,111
[car drives off]

889
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,535
[door opens]

890
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,389
Who was that guy at Ashley's school?

891
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,435
I knew you would ask that.

892
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,353
Mm-hmm.

893
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,855
Then who is he?

894
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,940
Just a friend.

895
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,485
Girl, do you think I'm that stupid?

896
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:11,030
Ma, I love you. And I respect you.

897
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,450
But I'm grown now.

898
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,952
I don't have to explain myself to you.

899
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:26,337
Yeah.

900
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:28,714
Well, I guess...

901
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:34,136
you don't have to explain
this either, huh?

902
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,221
- Huh?
- Ma.

903
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,223
Why are you going through my stuff?

904
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,810
What are you doing
with a briefcase full of dope money?

905
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:45,231
Whatever you have going on,
you need to stop it.

906
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:48,067
- Now.
- I know what I'm doing.

907
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,112
Do you? Do you really?

908
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,363
Hmm?

909
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,491
Who's gonna take care of your daughter
when you go to jail? Or worse.

910
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,119
[coughing]

911
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:01,205
- Please stop.
- No, damn it, you stop!

912
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,416
- [coughing]
- Mom.

913
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:05,668
- Let's get you something.
- [coughing continues]

914
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,564
I didn't raise you...

915
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,900
to get into this mess.

916
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,239
Mom. I'm not dad.

917
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:39,201
I'm not into any gangster stuff.

918
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:42,538
I'm not on drugs.
I'm not trying to shoot the city up.

919
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,207
This is just business.

920
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,254
Business? With a briefcase full of cash.

921
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,338
[scoffs]

922
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,304
[Dahlia sighs]

923
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,685
I've been through this...

924
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,605
madness...

925
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,524
with your father.

926
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:20,576
Do you know how many
so-called hustlers I've seen...

927
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:25,790
who think they figured out
how to beat the system?

928
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:30,544
It's a pipe dream. You know why?

929
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,632
Because you can't beat the system.

930
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:39,136
Sooner or later,
every hustle comes to an end.

931
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,059
[coughing]

932
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,940
Mommy.

933
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,943
Get some rest. Come on.

934
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:56,862
[coughing]

935
01:00:56,946 --> 01:01:00,115
Get up. Come on. Please.

936
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:02,493
I got you.

937
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:04,620
Baby...

938
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,997
[coughs, clears throat]

939
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,083
Let me just say this, okay?

940
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:16,131
The only players that make it
to the end of this game...

941
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,970
winds up doing time...

942
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:23,764
or dead...

943
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:26,016
or in a wheelchair like your father.

944
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,435
Think about it.

945
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:33,107
- I love you.
- I love you too.

946
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:54,712
Fu...

947
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,464
What the hell is this? Frozen?

948
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:00,676
Oh, no, no, no!

949
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:03,470
Damn!

950
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,352
Man, we got a problem.

951
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:11,770
[phone buzzing]

952
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:18,068
[Gigi] <i>Hey, Pastor.</i>

953
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,905
Blessings. We have an issue.

954
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:22,781
What's wrong?

955
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:27,786
One of your associates broke protocol
and got their accounts frozen.

956
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,204
Are you serious?

957
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:34,335
Kidding you is not something I do.
You need to handle this.

958
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,170
[sighs] Okay.

959
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,213
I'm on it.

960
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,528
You remember
what we talked about, okay?

961
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,700
Keep your rhythm.

962
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,620
Fight!

963
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,210
Don't forget to let that jab go, okay?

964
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,133
- You all right?
- I got it.

965
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,301
Keep your hands up.

966
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,307
[little Gigi] <i>I'm built for this.</i>

967
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:31,475
Fight!

968
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,823
Baby, don't forget your iPad.

969
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,583
Why do I have to live with dad?

970
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,877
- It's just for a little while.
- How long?

971
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,129
I don't know.

972
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,880
Will you please help me
get your stuff together?

973
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:03,632
Why won't you just tell me
what's going on?

974
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,342
It is not the time.

975
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:07,720
Now, will you please help me
get your stuff together?

976
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,185
Ashley?

977
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:16,520
Honey, come here.

978
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,232
<i>Your dad went to the courts</i>

979
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,402
and got the judge to grant him
temporary custody.

980
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,530
- Is this because of the fight I got into?
- No, baby, no.

981
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,823
No.

982
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,702
This has nothing to do with that.
You're not to blame, okay?

983
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,914
Okay, well, then...
what if I don't wanna go?

984
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:38,208
Unfortunately that's not up to you.

985
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,879
Or me. I don't want this either, baby.

986
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,135
Just know that your dad and I
love you very much.

987
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,680
We want what's best for you.

988
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:54,475
We just don't agree
on what that is right now.

989
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:58,353
Hey, we're gonna be okay.

990
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:01,648
We're gonna get through this, okay?
Come here.

991
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,446
[approaching footsteps]

992
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,492
- Grandma.
- Baby.

993
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,790
Now, listen to me.

994
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,542
Both of y'all.

995
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:23,670
This family has been
through worse than this.

996
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:26,673
A lot worse.

997
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:29,551
My house, your daddy's house,
this house...

998
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:30,969
[coughs]

999
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,390
...ain't nothing but four walls
and some furniture.

1000
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:41,522
What matters is that we are family,

1001
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,315
and that will never change,

1002
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,777
regardless of where you sleep at night.

1003
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,364
- Understand?
- Yeah.

1004
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,992
Yeah. It's time to go.

1005
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,878
- Mama.
- Come here.

1006
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:46,420
[gasps]

1007
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,172
What happened to my money?

1008
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,174
Hmm?

1009
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,892
Bobby did exactly
what I told him not to do.

1010
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:02,394
Bullshit, I did what I always do.

1011
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,022
You can't possibly be this fucking stupid!

1012
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,233
You had one job, one!

1013
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:09,943
- Shh!
- [Gigi] One...

1014
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,243
Tell me about my money, Gigi.

1015
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,289
He deposited the entire two million
into one account.

1016
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,250
- What?
- All at once.

1017
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:27,336
The IRS flagged it, it's frozen.

1018
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,340
He can't be trusted. He was probably drunk
when he did this shit.

1019
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,383
Let me tell you somethin',
I ain't never been drunk.

1020
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,469
Now, I might have been a little fucked up,

1021
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,096
but I wasn't drunk,
and I can be trustworthy!

1022
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,057
You the one that can't be trusted!

1023
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,726
Especially coming from somebody
who got a ex-husband as a fed.

1024
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,436
This ain't about me.

1025
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,647
Bullshit! It been about you, Gigi.

1026
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,609
The day since you came in,
it been about Gi-gi.

1027
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,487
We was doin' just fine
until your ragged ass came in here

1028
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,113
and got us caught up in your bullshit.

1029
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:56,698
You were doing just fine?

1030
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:59,660
You were a RICO prosecution
waiting to fucking happen.

1031
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,371
You should know, huh?
Tre, gimme the word.

1032
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:04,164
I been waitin' to pop this bitch.

1033
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:08,168
I don't have time for this shit.
I gotta clean up your mess.

1034
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,253
- [grunge]
- [Gigi gasps]

[body thuds]

1036
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:14,174
Tre.

1037
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:18,679
You know, Bobby was
the closest thing I had to a brother.

1038
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:23,308
Yet I just put a fucking bullet
in his head for fucking with my money!

1039
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,519
Look at him, look at him.

1040
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,896
I said fuckin' look at him. Look at him!

1041
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,106
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1042
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,316
Yeah, get real close.

1043
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,069
Get real fucking close.

1044
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,195
Yeah.

1045
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,072
I wanna know everything.

1046
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:40,200
From this moment, I need to know
every fucking thing

1047
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:42,244
that's going on with my money,
you hear me?

1048
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:45,706
- Tre, it's...
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1049
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,502
Hmm... Yeah.

1050
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:54,673
You know, Gigi, shit's changed.

1051
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,259
I need you to call whoever's in charge,

1052
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,636
"cause I'm gonna need somebody to tell me
what the fuck's going on,

1053
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,596
or I'll start doing things my way.

1054
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,015
Hmm?

1055
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:05,142
Open your fuckin' mouth,
open your mouth.

1056
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:09,730
If I could do that to my best friend,

1057
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:15,027
what the fuck you think I'd do
to a bitch ass federal prosecutor,

1058
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,195
a whore of a ex wife,

1059
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,698
or a piece of shit for a daughter? Huh?

1060
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,074
- Clean this shit up.
- [whimpering]

1061
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:24,244

["Nobody Loves the Blues But Me"
by Little G Weevil playing]

1063
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,308
Sorry for barging in.

1064
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:50,687
Uh, my client Tre is curious
about how all this works.

1065
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:54,358
I assume this stems
from our little bump in the road?

1066
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:57,694
Correct. He insists on having
more information.

1067
01:09:57,778 --> 01:09:59,529
- A lot more.
- Insists?

1068
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,740
Yeah. Is that a problem?

1069
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:04,659
- Son, slow--
-Wait, wait, wait, no.

1070
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,286
"Son"?

1071
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,830
Nigga, I'm not your son
and you definitely ain't my father.

1072
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:12,709
No, no, no, so what's going on
with my money, man?

1073
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,504
You brought that to make your point?

1074
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,006
I wasn't planning on having much
conversation with you, old man.

1075
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:21,968
Granted, I'm not as young as I once was,

1076
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:26,932
but, uh, in that amount of time,
I was able to learn a couple things.

1077
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:31,812
What I learned was, what's better
than being tough is being prepared.

1078
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,063
[rifle cocks]

1079
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:42,823
Excellent.

1080
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,493
Tre. Have a seat.

1081
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:51,665
Are you familiar with the term
"Black Wall Street"?

1082
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:56,211
No, I'm not.

1083
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:59,798
[Pastor] <i>Black Wall Street is
the most successful black economy</i>

1084
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,883
<i>in American financial history.</i>

1085
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:07,556
<i>That is, until it was burned
to the ground, the entire city,</i>

1086
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:10,392

1087
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,018
And what's that got to do with me, man?

1088
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,606
Well, everything disappeared
except the intangibles.

1089
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,443
The buildings and the banks
were destroyed,

1090
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,571
but, uh, the information,
the knowledge,

1091
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,490
the connections, the network,
that remained.

1092
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,495
And... [chuckles] what are we doing?

1093
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:35,917
Tre, you are talking to the head
of the largest,

1094
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:38,920
longest-running most successful
money-laundering operation

1095
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:40,338
in the history of this country.

1096
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,180
[chuckles]

1097
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,559
So the church is a front?

1098
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:58,315
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1099
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:04,279
This particular way is one
where we have an institution

1100
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:08,533
that's under our complete control
without being challenged.

1101
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:11,369
And, uh, we use that behind the scenes

1102
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:14,623
to further the interests
of the black community

1103
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:18,126
in every way and situation that we can.

1104
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:24,925
Also, as a side note,
primarily a cash business.

1105
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,013
The point is,
your money is perfectly safe.

1106
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,349
Well, how would I be sure?

1107
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,269
Give me $20.

1108
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,957
Thank you, sister,
for your kind donation of $10.

1109
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,418
You mean $20.

1110
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,672
That was $10.

1111
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:06,049
But she just gave you $20.

1112
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:09,135
I'm gonna need you to prove that
or say "allegedly."

1113
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,265
[laughs]

1114
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:14,975
The secret is in the simplicity.

1115
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:18,019
- So that's it?
- That's it.

1116
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,022
- Well, how does it work if you--
- Hold on.

1117
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:25,110
Before we go any further...

1118
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,737
What I shared with you thus far,

1119
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:31,241
I shared with you so that
you could have peace of mind,

1120
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:32,617
so that you could feel better.

1121
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,371
But any further conversation

1122
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:40,542
is a bit much for me to be
having with an outsider, to be honest.

1123
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,419
Well, I mean...

1124
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:45,463
two million dollars, I would think,
puts me on the inside, so...

1125
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:46,798
[chuckles]

1126
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:49,759

Let's just say you're not
one of his bigger clients.

1128
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,890
I don't give a shit, I told you I need
to know about my money,

1129
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:57,225
so what's going on with my money?

1130
01:13:57,309 --> 01:14:00,729
Before you accidentally
insult the Lord and I...

1131
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:06,234
Gigi, your call.

1132
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:10,155
Go ahead.

1133
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,617
My misunderstanding.

1134
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,410
It's just a financial issue.

1135
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,246
[chuckles]

1136
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:24,878
The Lord has blessed us
to not have financial issues.

1137
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,008
What's this?

1138
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:33,887
That is to thank you for the assistance
that you gave

1139
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,972
in building the senior center

1140
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:40,060
that the community has been looking
forward to for ten years.

1141
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:47,359
And that one is for
the basketball gymnasium

1142
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:51,529
that you supplied the buildout for.
The community appreciates that as well.

1143
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,367
That should help with the money
frozen in your account.

1144
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:00,830
Just like that?

1145
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:03,625
Just like that. Just like Gigi said.

1146
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,294
The secret is the simplicity.

1147
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:11,675
Okay. Thank you.

1148
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,823

Oh, it's right here.

Whoo! You about ready?

1151
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,747
Better get you dropped off
so I can get to my meeting.

1152
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,290
Yeah, almost.

1153
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,254
Can I call Mom when I come back home?

1154
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,715
Of course you can, baby.

1155
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:55,385
You don't need permission
to call your mom.

1156
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,887
[softly] Yeah, only to see her.

1157
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,768
Ashley, we've been through this
SO many times.

1158
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:07,772
And every time you and Mama
get into a fight,

1159
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:10,275
I'm the one that gets stuck in the middle.

1160
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,447
It's not fair.

1161
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:18,241
Life isn't fair. Okay?

1162
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,743
It's about time you learned that.

1163
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,706
I'm sorry.

1164
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:27,542
I'm doing the best I can
with what I've been given.

1165
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,004
If you do something or your mom
does something to make it worse,

1166
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,758
it just makes it harder for me.

1167
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:37,635

1168
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:39,262

Is that what you would do?

1382
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:31,398
Sometimes in life you...
you have to do what you have to do.

1383
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:35,861
And I do understand that more than most.

1384
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:36,987
Yeah.

1385
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:40,365
But you can't let
those moments define you.

1386
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:50,167
So...

1387
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,463
maybe that night, in that moment...

1388
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,510
you didn't have a choice.

1389
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,388
Mom?

1390
01:34:07,351 --> 01:34:08,644
Yeah.

1391
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:15,359
All I'm saying is, right here, right now,

1392
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,070
you do.

1393
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,073
You have a choice.

1394
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,992
And what you do with that choice

1395
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:26,495
determines what kind of person you are,

1396
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,457
and more importantly,

1397
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:34,545
what kind of woman you're gonna become.

1398
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,762
You need me to... come?

1399
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:45,472
No.

1400
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:48,892
I got it.

1401
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:53,105
I was built for this.

1402
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,528
Hold on, baby, don't forget this.

1403
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:21,717
Hi. I got these for you.

1404
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:28,265
I'm sorry about everything.

1405
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,977
[Saundra] It was all my fault.
I'm sorry too.
