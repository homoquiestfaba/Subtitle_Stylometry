NARRATOR: Once,

4
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:30,673
long ago, in the
deep blue below,

5
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:35,778
there was a kingdom, a king,
a queen, and six sisters,

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,179
princesses of the sea.

7
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:40,683
The ocean realm was
theirs, and the princesses

8
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,118
were free to go
wherever they wished,

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,889
except for one place.

her 15th birthday

12
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:57,401
was allowed to venture to the

13
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,936
Finally, the time came.

14
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:03,674
The littlest mermaid's
15th birthday.

15
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,647
And what she saw above would
alter her existence forever.

16
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:12,781
A prince.

17
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:13,951
A true love.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,353
When the prince fell the
little mermaid found herself

19
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:19,590
so drawn to him.

20
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,691
Despite stories she
had heard of the dangers

21
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:24,462
above she had to save him.

22
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,766
She lingered over the
prince, gazing at him.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,970
She wondered what
this feeling was.

24
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,872
What would it be like
to be with him?

25
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:37,708
To actually have legs?

26
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,746
She had never
felt this way before.

27
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:45,581
As another human approached,

28
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,282
she gave the prince
one last look

29
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:49,221
before descending back
into the sea.

30
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:53,424
She watched from behind a
rock as the prince awoke.

31
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,594
He opened his eyes, thinking
that the one

32
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,998
who stood before him
had saved his life.

33
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,869
The little mermaid was so sad.

34
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,671
She had left her heart above,

35
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,709
and wondered if a mermaid
could ever be with a human.

36
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:17,480
She swam into the
darkest depths of the sea

37
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:18,817
where there lived a wizard.

38
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,018
And she told the wizard
of her love and her

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,923
desperation for legs like
those who lived above.

40
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,126
The cunning wizard made
her an offer.

41
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:32,531
He said he would grant her a
wish in exchange for one thing,

42
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:34,399
her soul.

43
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:39,602
But if she were to go above
and not be able to find love,

44
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:42,541
her soul would be his
until true love came.

45
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,045
The little mermaid agreed.

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,448
The promise was forged,
the bond made.

47
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,920
But upon finding her
prince she found his heart

48
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:59,091
still belonged to the
woman on the shore.

49
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,092
The little mermaid was
visited by the wizard

50
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,230
who had come to collect
on their agreement.

51
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:07,766
She pleaded with the
wizard, but it was too late.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,102
Above the sea the wizard
would keep her locked away

53
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,406
ensuring she would never
find true love,

54
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,743
and her power would
be his forever.

55
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:30,287
If I told you a secret,
would you be able to keep it?

56

Yes, yes, I would keep
my secret.

do you make it?

The first rule of

the How or the Why.

400
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,553
But it's not magic is it?

401
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:12,790
Surely if it works, there
must be some medical formula.
