1
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>Ah, America.</i>

2
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:32,875
<i>You beacon of composure
and proportionate response.</i>

3
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>You bringer of calm
and goodness to the world.</i>

4
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,542
<i>What do you do
when the war you're fighting</i>

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,583
<i>just can't possibly be won
in any meaningful sense?</i>

6
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>Well, obviously,
you sack the guy not winning it,</i>

7
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,083
<i>and you bring in some other guy.</i>

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,750
<i>In 2009, that war was Afghanistan.</i>

9
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,458
<i>And that other guy...</i>

10
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,625
<i>was Glen.</i>

11
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,667
You boys ready?

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,792
Let's go win this thing.

13
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,458
<i>Okay.</i>

14
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:35,667
<i>So this is what I learned
about four-star General Glen McMahon.</i>

15
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>He was born to a military family
at Fort Leavenworth.</i>

16
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,875
<i>Graduated West Point in 1976.</i>

17
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,042
<i>Ranger school in '79.</i>

18
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:48,208
<i>He had a graduate degree in political
affairs and military history from Yale.</i>

19
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:53,542
<i>He was both a straight-A student
and a troublemaker.</i>

20
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,542
<i>He once famously attempted
to stick a lit cherry bomb</i>

21
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,417
<i>up his sleeping drill sergeant's ass.</i>

22
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,125
<i>He was loved by the men and women
who served under him.</i>

23
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,250
Three, two, one, let's go.

24
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,851
<i>Never afraid
to get his hands dirty.</i>

25
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,542
Yeah, it's flash time.

26
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,792
<i>Never willing to send his troops</i>
<i>anywhere he wouldn't go himself.</i>

27
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:16,417
<i>He was known variously as the Lion King,
the G-Man, Big Glen</i>

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,875
<i>and, most commonly, the Glenimal.</i>

29
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,250
<i>He was like a throwback to another era.</i>

30
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,500
<i>His hand was bent into a permanent claw,</i>

31
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,458
<i>like it was still clutching
a World War II cigar</i>

32
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:32,250
<i>his modern, fitness-fanatic self
wouldn't allow him to smoke.</i>

33
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,833
<i>After a successful stint</i>

34
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:37,750
<i>running the secretive special operations
killing machine in Iraq,</i>

35
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,917
<i>Glen was appointed leader of US
and coalition forces in Afghanistan.</i>

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
<i>A war which, as he saw it,</i>

37
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,375
<i>wasn't being won
'cause it wasn't being led.</i>

38
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,667
General.

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,875
We're all very excited to have you here.
It's an honor to meet you.

40
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,042
I'm excited to be here.
Ain't that right, Greg?

41
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,167
Yes, indeed, sir. You're very excited.

42
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,083
<i>Somehow, while he was in Iraq,</i>

43
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,208
<i>Glen found time
to author a book on leadership,</i>

44
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:06,792
<i>entitled One Leg at a Time,
Just Like Everybody Else.</i>

45
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,875
<i>In it, he wrote,
men are imperfect creatures.</i>

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,875
<i>Left to their own devices,</i>

47
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:17,042
<i>all they really want to do is play
with their dicks and eat chicken.</i>

48
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:21,625
For all his many achievements
leading special operations in Iraq,

49
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,500
I think most of us here
will know General McMahon

50
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:29,250
as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi,
who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.

51
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,458
You're welcome.

52
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,792
We have a warrior at the helm,
and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.

53
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,375
<i>Glen was known as a humble man.</i>

54
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:44,042
<i>But humble in that way that says,
my humility makes me better than you.</i>

55
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,958
<i>He was famous for his Spartan regime
of routine and discipline.</i>

56
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:53,292
<i>He ate one meal a day.
He slept four hours per night.</i>

57
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,042
<i>He ran seven miles every morning.</i>

58
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,458
<i>In Iraq, he transformed special operations
with what he called</i>

59
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,458
<i>systemic negation
of repetitive procedural practice.</i>

60
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:11,083
<i>Or, to the acronym-obsessed military,
SNORPP.</i>

61
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,542
We got Italy in there.

62
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,750
That's the Dutch.

63
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,792
We got Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine.

64
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,833
We got Australia over there,
Croatia, Belgium...

65
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:23,625
Okay, that'll do. Bite-size chunks, hmm?
Let's knock this on the head.

66
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,417
All right.

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,875
<i>Basically, he was a master</i>
<i>of systems organization.</i>

68
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,333
<i>Which he'd kind of need to be,</i>

69
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:35,167
<i>if he was to corral
this 43-nation coalition of the willing.</i>

70
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,027
- May I help you?
- No, finish your phone call.

71
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,208
The war can wait.

72
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,875
What can I do for you, General?

73
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,375
I want to pull everyone
out of their offices.

74
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,625
I want to open this place up.

75
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,500
I came in here
to speak with you about that.

76
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,542
I have only ten men
to lead here in Afghanistan, huh.

77
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,375
So it make no sense for me
to be sit out there with everybody else.

78
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,500
I get it. All right?

79
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,292
But everybody has a reason
not to be out there with everybody else.

80
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,750
Austria only has two guys here.
Iceland has seven guys.

81
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,000
This country won't fight at night.
That country won't fight in the snow.

82
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,333
This country
wants to do counter-narcotics.

83
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,542
That country won't do counter-narcotics.

84
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,375
But if we're in the same room...

85
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,750
<i>Cory Staggart</i>
<i>was Glen's executive officer.</i>

86
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,167
<i>Ran the general's affairs.</i>

87
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,083
<i>He was a Ranger.</i>

88
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,375
<i>Although how he made it through
Ranger school, I have no idea.</i>

89
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,143
That's great. Thank you, guys.

90
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,967
That's all the time we got.
Let's go. Come on.

91
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,125
Greg Pulver.

92
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:41,375
<i>General Greg Pulver graduated West Point
in the same class as Glen.</i>

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,208
Oh, that's interesting.

94
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,405
Does he have security clearance?

95
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,083
<i>And hadn't left his side since.</i>

96
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,208
Then fucking let him in

97
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,917
just like you would any other fucking
person with a fucking security clearance!

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,250
<i>His official title</i>
<i>was director of intelligence,</i>

99
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,375
<i>but all I saw was a guy
with anger management issues</i>

100
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,917
<i>whose life had no meaning without Glen.</i>

101
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,583
<i>Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz,</i>

102
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>providing the general
with all forms of IT support.</i>

103
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,083
Andy.

104
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,559
- Yes, sir?
<i>- Which Glen needed often.</i>

105
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,393
- How are you?
- Pretty good, sir. How are you doing?

106
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,167
Swell. Can you come with me a moment?

107
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,458
- My electric razor is...
- Oh, yes, sir.

108
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,125
Yeah, broken.

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,875
<i>Pete Duckman was a Navy SEAL.</i>

110
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,667
<i>Like Pulver, his job title
had the word "intelligence" in it.</i>

111
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,250
- What's going on?
- Boss is visiting with President Karzai.

112
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,125
Cool. Why so fancy?

113
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,917
He's a world leader.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,917
Cool. Am I coming?

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Yes, you are. It's your job.

116
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,208
God damn it, Pete. Why are you fat?

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,000
- I'm not fat.
<i>- I still, to this day,</i>

118
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,667
<i>don't know exactly what it was
that Duckman did for the general.</i>

119
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,500
It's a mixture
of cross-pollinational collation...

120
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,208
<i>Admiral Simon Ball</i>
<i>was Glen's public affairs officer.</i>

121
00:06:56,292 --> 00:07:00,042
- Cooperational, cooperative...
<i>- For three and a half years,</i>

122
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,167
<i>he'd been trying to explain
SNORPP to the Washington press gallery.</i>

123
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,542
...with a centralized command

124
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,917
centralization structure,
and... things like that.

125
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,292
<i>Matt Little
was Glen's new civilian PR consultant.</i>

126
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,583
Oh, I don't know. Is this a good hand?

127
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,833
<i>- He was a DC marketing hotshot...</i>
- Straight flush. Hello?

128
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,833
<i>And sometime lobbyist who had thought</i>

129
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,958
<i>the war in Afghanistan
to be entirely pointless.</i>

130
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,500
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not going there.

131
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,500
<i>Until he was offered
a lot of money to sell it.</i>

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,583
How much?

133
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,250
<i>And Willy Dunne.</i>

134
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,292
- Right this way, boss. Yeah.
<i>- Willy was Glen's body man.</i>

135
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,667
Put your things in here.
I'll let you spread them out how you like.

136
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,375
Why is this my room?

137
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:46,375
This was General Whelan's room.
It's got a great bathroom here.

138
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,875
<i>Willy laundered Glen's clothes.</i>
<i>He did Glen's ironing.</i>

139
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah. Boss?

140
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,792
<i>He polished Glen's shoes.</i>

141
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,042
<i>He always seemed
like he was about to collapse</i>

142
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,958
<i>from the weight

143
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,542
- Willy!
- Yes, boss?

144
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,625
- Put my stuff in this room.
- Okay.

145
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,458
Here to fight a goddamn war,
not watch goddamn television.

146
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,625
<i>Willy was the first person</i>
<i>that Glen saw every morning</i>

147
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,042
<i>and the last person he saw every night.</i>

148
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,208
<i>Glen loved these men...</i>

149
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,125
<i>and they loved him right back.</i>

150
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,375
I don't know
how it looks to you, Cory,

151
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,958
but it seems to me, everybody's forgotten
we're fighting a war here.

152
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:42,250
We got the goddamn Pizza Kings
and Burger Huts.

153
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,458
The entire base
is rolling with Eurosexuals

154
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,667
who are so drunk they can't even stand up.

155
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,375
General McMahon here
to see Ambassador MacKinnon.

156
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,417
- Glen.
- Pat.

157
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,833
Great to see you.
You know Dick Waddle, of course.

158
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,292
- Dick.
- Glen.

159
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:17,958
Ray Canucci.

160
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,417
- Ray.
- Glen.

161
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,792
Grab a seat, boys.

162
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,417
I'm calling myself Richard now,
Pat, if you don't mind.

163
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,075
Okay, fine...

164
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,694
That's fair. My apologies.

165
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,833
- Have you settled in, Glen?
- No, Pat, I haven't.

166
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,417
Seems to me that too much settling in

167
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,780
might somehow be at the heart
of the problem we have here.

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,167
Small talk.

169
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,292
Should've gone with the weather.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,125
Glen, the president wants you
to get the lay of the land here.

171
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,500
This war's been running eight years now.

172
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,500
President Obama, as you know,
is drawing down troops in Iraq

173
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,417
to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.

174
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,958
Henry Whelan was a good man,
he meant well,

175
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,292
but he just wasn't getting the job done.

176
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,708
Now, given your reputation
and your formidable drive,

177
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:17,500
our hope is that you're the man
who will get the job done.

178
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:21,583
First things first. We want you to make
an assessment of the situation here.

179
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,875
Travel the country, talk to people.

180
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,958
At the end of that assessment,
you'll tell us what needs to be done,

181
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:31,875
how you're gonna get it done
and what you need in order to get it done.

182
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,417
- So, now...
- To that end...

183
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,625
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you go.

184
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,417
- I thought you were finished.
- You go.

185
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
- You sure?
- You go.

186
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,042
- I thought you were finished.
- No.

187
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,042
To that end...

188
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,875
now is probably
a good time to share with you

189
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,708
where the president hopes
that assessment might land.

190
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,958
Obviously, the endgame here
is to just finish this thing.

191
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,333
So, how do we do that?

192
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,958
- Is it by reducing our footprint here?
<i>- The civilian executive.</i>

193
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:08,083
<i>These were guys who, in Glen's eyes,
hadn't earned their power the way he had,</i>

194
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,542
<i>through hard work and discipline.</i>

195
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,958
I don't know. But whatever it is,
we want you to bring it on home, Glen.

196
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,167
But, whatever you do,

197
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,208
please do not ask the president
for more troops.

198
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,167
No more troops, Glen.

199
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,250
<i>These were men who'd acquired</i>
<i>their power through charm and seduction,</i>

200
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:35,083
<i>and who seemed to serve no purpose other
than to stand in the way of his greatness.</i>

201
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,708
God, it's so fucking hot!

202
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,833
Fuck!

203
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Another fucking assessment.

204
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:46,000
How many assessments do they need?
Just one fucking assessment after another.

205
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,417
They all point the same direction.

206
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,250
Bring General Glen McMahon in here
and do whatever the fuck he says!

207
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,125
Settle down, Greg.
They just wanna feel involved, is all.

208
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,042
<i>Wars aren't fought</i>
<i>by nations or by armies.</i>

209
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,042
<i>Wars are fought by men.</i>

210
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:08,042
<i>There are two types of general
in the American military.</i>

211
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,917
<i>There are those who believe they can win</i>

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,583
<i>in the face of all evidence
to the contrary.</i>

213
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,292
<i>And there are those who know they can't.</i>

214
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,000
<i>Unfortunately for the world,</i>

215
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,458
<i>it's the believers
who climb to the top of the ladder.</i>

216
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:24,542
<i>It's guys like Glen
who get given the keys to the castle.</i>

217
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,625
President Karzai is very much
looking forward to meeting you.

218
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,500
I think you will like each other.
There is no need to be nervous.

219
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,792
I'm not nervous.

220
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,708
Fuck!

221
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,750
Fuck it.

222
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,875
Ah! General, excuse me.

223
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,625
We are trying
to make this Blu-ray player work.

224
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,033
Do you know how they function?

225
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:11,542
Normally, you have those wires with
the red, the yellow and the white plug.

226
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,083
But this machine seems
only to have this wire.

227
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,417
I can't find where to plug it
into the television.

228
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,042
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

229
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,667
I'm afraid I don't know
a whole lot about technology.

230
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,667
I'm sure I could have somebody come by
and take a look at it for you.

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,167
Fuck it. Never mind.

232
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,833
I think I need a new television.

233
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,875
I'm sorry, General.

234
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:36,875
Please, let's sit.

235
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,667
Welcome.

236
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,750
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Please call me Hamid.

237
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,833
Excuse me.

238
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,750
Please.

239
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:09,000
Your predecessor, General Whelan,
I liked him.

240
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,125
I'm not entirely certain he liked me.

241
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,792
He didn't visit very often.

242
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:16,708
Why was he dismissed?

243
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:21,125
It seems one minute he was here...

244
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,125
the next minute, not here.

245
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,875
Well, Mr. President,

246
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,833
I think our government
simply felt it was...

247
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,875
time our effort took a new direction.

248
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,600
And what is this new direction?

249
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,792
It is most important to me
that we build Afghanistan.

250
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:46,750
Together, we build Afghanistan
into a free and prosperous nation.

251
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,333
Free from fear and conflict.

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,250
- I see. I see.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,458
Sounds a lot like the old direction.

254
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,458
No.

255
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:02,125
But perhaps you yourself
are the new direction.

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,875
New strong personality.

257
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,250
New energy. New commitment.

258
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,750
Well, General,
I wish you the best of luck.

259
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:19,375
Sir, my team and I are about
to embark on a...

260
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,625
a tour of the country

261
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,601
so that we may make an assessment...

262
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,375
to precisely understand
what is required of us here.

263
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,542
It would be an honor if you would
consider joining me on the tour,

264
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,958
so that our project
might be a unified endeavor.

265
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
A sharing of our purpose...

266
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,167
Of our shared purpose.

267
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,583
Thank you for the invitation, General.

268
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:59,150
It's very generous.

269
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,458
But...

270
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,292
I've seen the country.

271
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,958
<i>To get inside</i>
<i>the mind of Glen McMahon,</i>

272
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:36,042
<i>you really need first to get a handle
on the madness of modern American war.</i>

273
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,583
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.
Welcome to Kandahar, sir.

274
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,875
Nice to meet you, Frank.
I'm here to get the lay of the land.

275
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,750
<i>Counterinsurgency.</i>

276
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,625
<i>In the good old days,</i>
<i>wars were fought</i>

277
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,542
<i>against conventional armies
from nation states.</i>

278
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,875
<i>Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.</i>

279
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,583
<i>When, however, you've just gone
and invaded a place</i>

280
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,976
<i>that you probably shouldn't have,</i>

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,292
<i>you end up fighting against just
regular people in regular-people clothes.</i>

282
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,000
<i>These guys are what are called insurgents.</i>

283
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,500
<i>Basically, they're just guys
who picked up weapons 'cause...</i>

284
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,500
<i>so would you,
if someone invaded your country.</i>

285
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,417
<i>Funnily enough...</i>

286
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,333
<i>insurgencies are next to impossible
to defeat.</i>

287
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,000
<i>And so, if you wanna go on
pretending you can win,</i>

288
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,875
<i>you're really left with no option</i>

289
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,167
<i>but to try to convince
the country you've invaded</i>

290
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,333
<i>that you're actually here to help.</i>

291
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,667
He's saying the Americans
are urinating in the streets,

292
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,750
and they call us motherfuckers
all day.

293
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,333
It's motherfucker motherfucker
all the time.

294
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:44,500
And it's considered in our culture
a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.

295
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,083
In ours, too... in ours, too.

296
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>This is counterinsurgency.</i>
<i>It's a popularity contest.</i>

297
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,042
Salaam alaikum.

298
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,601
<i>You're trying</i>
<i>to convince the people</i>

299
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,833
<i>that they're better off with you
than they are with the insurgents.</i>

300
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:02,833
<i>Basically, it works like this.
You install a local government.</i>

301
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,958
<i>You provide security for the people
so that that democracy can take root.</i>

302
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,226
We're training them up,
taking them out on maneuvers.

303
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,684
<i>You train up the local forces</i>

304
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,000
<i>so that they can provide
the security for themselves.</i>

305
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,250
I mean, they're sweet kids.
They're good kids.

306
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,208
Good-natured. Integrational.

307
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:21,792
You know, they are very integrational
as a people.

308
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,125
You know, I mean,
they are committed to...

309
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,458
- But...
<i>- Or at least you try to.</i>

310
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,542
I don't know, sir, they're also lazy.

311
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,667
I mean, they really seem
like they don't wanna be here.

312
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,708
They steal our shit and basically,
they're on drugs all the time.

313
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,458
I mean,
they are fucking high all the time.

314
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,542
Excuse my language, sir.

315
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,458
<i>You do whatever you can
to stimulate the local economy.</i>

316
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,750
Heroin is the only thing
bringing money in.

317
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,184
Not that I like to think where
the money is going to exactly,

318
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,917
but money keeps the people happy,
so we're rolling with that.

319
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,833
Can't they grow something else?

320
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,208
Yeah, they could grow cotton.
Cotton would grow here.

321
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:06,059
- Why don't they grow cotton then?
- Because the United States Congress

322
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,500
will not allow any United States aid
and development funds

323
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,000
to be directed
towards the cultivation of a crop

324
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,375
that will end up on the world market
in competition with US farmers.

325
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,500
- Which pretty much rules out cotton.
- Sure.

326
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,500
- So we're growing heroin instead.
- Right.

327
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,625
I think we're doing
a pretty good job here, sir.

328
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>You build infrastructure.</i>
<i>Roads, schools, stuff like that.</i>

329
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,375
What kind of presence
does the Taliban have here?

330
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,708
- Who?
- The Taliban.

331
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:37,208
<i>In short, you get off your bases
and you go make friends with the people.</i>

332
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,333
<i>Killing insurgents all the while,
of course.</i>

333
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,375
<i>Nation building. Hearts and minds.</i>

334
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,333
Hello! Hello, all.

335
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,292
Let me break it down
this way, General.

336
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,208
We've been in Helmand province
for five years now,

337
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:56,917
and in all that time, all we've
really managed to secure is this base.

338
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Now, you go out there, you go into Marjah,

339
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:03,000
you go into Lashkar Gah,
it's all Pashtun, as you know.

340
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,000
This is the Taliban.

341
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,417
We're not winning any hearts
and minds there, I can tell you that.

342
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,083
I'm not sure we ever will.
Kandahar's the same, of course.

343
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,458
Can I be completely frank with you, sir?

344
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,667
If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.

345
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,375
I'd concentrate
on those parts of the country

346
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,958
that are at least, in some way,
sympathetic to the mission,

347
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,125
and I'd cut it loose.

348
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,292
It's a lost cause.

349
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,500
This whole province constitutes
just 4% of the population of the country.

350
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,542
It's strategically meaningless.

351
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,833
I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.

352
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,792
<i>The thing about counterinsurgency</i>
<i>is that it doesn't really work.</i>

353
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,875
<i>We tried it in Vietnam. That went well.</i>

354
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,875
<i>The British and the French gave it a shot,</i>

355
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,625
<i>trying to hang on
to their crumbling empires.</i>

356
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,333
<i>It just hasn't worked.</i>

357
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,583
<i>To me, it would seem kind of simple why.</i>

358
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,583
<i>You can't win the trust of a country
by invading it.</i>

359
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,792
<i>You can't build a nation at gunpoint.</i>

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,958
<i>For guys like Glen however,</i>

361
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,125
<i>counterinsurgency hasn't worked
for one simple reason.</i>

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,833
You ready, boss?

363
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,625
<i>Nobody's ever done it right.</i>

364
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:35,042
Yes, I am, Pete. I sure as hell am.

365
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,333
- Andy?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,375
- Good job.
- Thank you.

367
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,708
Let's lose Fox News.

368
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:55,042
Won't do us any good to have a bunch
of angry perverts yelling at us all day.

369
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,708
- Yes, sir.
- So...

370
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,667
we probably need
to get to work on this assessment.

371
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,958
- Already written it.
- When?

372
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,292
It's already written. Did it last night.

373
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,417
Needs a little flesh on the bone,
but basically it's written.

374
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,042
All right, what's it say?

375
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,542
Greg...

376
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,500
I wanna take Helmand province.

377
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,667
I wanna take Helmand province

378
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,000
precisely because everyone else
seems to think we can't have it.

379
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,393
If we're gonna win
the trust of this country,

380
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:30,417
we can't be seen to accept that there's
a whole chunk of it we can't handle.

381
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
We're here to provide security.

382
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,625
I say the first order of business
is we secure that corner of the country

383
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,875
everyone else seems to think
we can't control.

384
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,875
Okay.

385
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,500
I didn't come here to manage this war,

386
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,917
and I sure as shit didn't come here
to close it out.

387
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,708
Came here to win.

388
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:52,125
I'm taking Helmand
then I'm taking Kandahar.

389
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,708
What do you say to that?

390
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,708
All right, and another thing.

391
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,125
Being that this is
a nation-building exercise and all,

392
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,417
seems to me it'd behoove us
to have someone in the room

393
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,917
who's actually from the nation
we're building. Don't you think?

394
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:16,875
Copy.

395
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,833
We are here to build, to protect.

396
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:25,917
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.

397
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,958
We're not here to shoot first
and ask questions later.

398
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:33,875
We must not be driven
by fear and suspicion.

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,833
We are here above all else...

400
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,417
to support the civilian population.

401
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,708
And to that end,
we must avoid killing it at all cost.

402
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:54,083
Civilian casualties cannot be seen
as an unfortunate byproduct of conflict.

403
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,833
They must be treated as errors
of the greatest consequence.

404
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,667
This is the war we are fighting.

405
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,667
It's a complex war,
but it's a war nonetheless.

406
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,875
Let me reaffirmate that
right from the get-go.

407
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,042
This is a war.

408
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,500
But it's a war that cannot be won

409
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,458
by the virtues of our unassailable
military might and power alone.

410
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,250
This war will be won primarily

411
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:29,458
with the unassailable might
and power of our ideals.

412
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

413
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:38,792
Yeah.

414
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,375
- Forty thousand?
- I'm afraid so.

415
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,268
God damn it. What did we tell you?
No more troops.

416
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't ask for more troops. What do you do?

417
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,333
You ask for 40,000 more troops.

418
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:52,417
Well, Dick, Helmand province
ain't exactly about to secure itself.

419
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,458
Probably should've asked for a lot more.

420
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,226
I just thought 40,000 sounded
like a reasonable number.

421
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,917
There's no reasonable number, Glen,
except perhaps zero.

422
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,667
That's a reasonable number. Zero.
I thought you understood that.

423
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,375
Yeah, this "no more troops" thing,

424
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,518
is that coming from the president,
or coming from you?

425
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:09,083
Of course it's coming from the president.

426
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,351
Why would it be coming from me?

427
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,417
Why do I care if we send more troops
over there or we don't?

428
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
I don't know, Dick.
I'm just trying to work this thing out.

429
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,125
The president gave me a job to do.

430
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,542
- This is what I need to get it done.
- God damn it.

431
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,250
I'll be there day after tomorrow
with the secretary of state.

432
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,583
We'll figure this nonsense out then.

433
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,833
- Roger that.
- God damn it.

434
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,083
God damn it.

435
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
There it is.

436
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,542
What did I tell you?
He's on retired-general time.

437
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,458
His mind's on a golf cart somewhere,
halfway down the fairway.

438
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,375
He doesn't have the constitution
for the hard stuff anymore.

439
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,417
He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!

440
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,375
That thing's off, right?

441
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,583
I'm sorry to have to tell
you this, General,

442
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:59,583
but we're gonna sit on your report
until after the Afghan elections.

443
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,333
With all due respect, Madam Secretary,
the election is a month away.

444
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:09,417
I know it is but as I'm sure you know,
an election here is a fragile thing.

445
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,625
It's a very delicate thing,

446
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:16,417
and nobody wants its smooth running to be
muddied by a big new American offensive.

447
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,375
No, I told you no more troops, Glen.

448
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,226
Now we're gonna have to
rethink the game plan.

449
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,167
Well, Dick, with all due respect,

450
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,667
you told me you didn't care
if I got more troops or I didn't,

451
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,083
so I'm trying to work out
how to get the job done.

452
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,875
No, I did not say I didn't care.

453
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,750
- I believe you did.
- I did not say that.

454
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,518
- I believe you did.
- No. No, I didn't. I...

455
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:37,167
- You did, Dick.
- Whoever said what,

456
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,708
a troop surge and an election
don't sit well together,

457
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,208
so this is the way it's gotta be.
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,434
I don't know what I'm supposed
to be doing in the meantime.

459
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,833
I have a strategy. I'm ready to execute.

460
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,708
The suggestion now
seems to be that I thumb twiddle.

461
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,500
With all due respect,
Madam Secretary...

462
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,833
General, please spare me
the "all due respect" stuff.

463
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,833
It's really giving me the fucking creeps.

464
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,875
I think, I think we all understand
your frustration, Glen,

465
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,833
but these elections have to run smoothly.

466
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,458
We need a legitimate partner
in power here.

467
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,250
You need a legitimate partner here.

468
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,083
So we just have to sit tight.

469
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,750
Why don't you do that SNORPP thing
you did in Iraq?

470
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:22,667
You know, get your systems in place,
get everybody talking together.

471
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,250
The time will fly, you know?
Get everybody excited.

472
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,500
You know, you're the best
in the business at this stuff.

473
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,434
<i>We've been operating</i>
<i>at an extremely high optempo.</i>

474
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,667
<i>In the last week,
we've conducted six air assaults</i>

475
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,167
<i>into previously denied territories.</i>

476
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,042
<i>We're also</i>
<i>in final coordination with RC South</i>

477
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:45,792
<i>to develop an ops box</i>

478
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:49,792
<i>in the seams
existing along the provincial border.</i>

479
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,792
You got that Lexus?

480
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,167
No. No, now we got a Prius.
She got the new Prius.

481
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,250
Sweet.

482
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,684
Yeah, my wife, too. She's got one.

483
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,417
We both have one. We love it.

484
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,250
My first car was a Taurus.

485
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,573
My father bought it.

486
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,375
What do you got?

487
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:25,792
Sir.

488
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,417
Where you boys headed?

489
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,417
Back to our patrol base, sir. Sasquatch.

490
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,333
Where you coming from?

491
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,976
Where are we from in the States,
or where have we just been?

492
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,500
Where have you just been?

493
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,750
Italy, sir, on R&R.

494
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,583
R&R in Italy.

495
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,792
- Yes, sir.
- Well...

496
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,417
Attention on deck!

497
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,000
So why the long faces?
You just got back from Italy.

498
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:11,333
I'm guessing you ate
some sensational food,

499
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,917
saw some antiquities?

500
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,875
I bet you got yourselves good and drunk
and bumped into beautiful girls.

501
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,917
So what's it like out there?

502
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:28,917
Out where, sir?

503
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,458
- Sasquatch, son.
- Oh...

504
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,958
it's not good, sir.
You know, I mean, it's whatever.

505
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:37,542
- It's... it's okay.
- No, it's a fucking shithole, sir.

506
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,934
No, I don't know.
We'll see where we land.

507
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,375
Cory, what time's that bird due?

508
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,750
- In about 20 minutes.
- Cancel it.

509
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,625
Uh, why's that, boss?

510
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,750
I'm going to Sasquatch
with those boys there.

511
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,042
General, those boys are heading out
to an inhospitable corner of the world.

512
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,833
I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.

513
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,833
Those boys, they need me.

514
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,375
I've spent the last week or so

515
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:02,167
talking to guys
who I would call middle management.

516
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,875
But you boys are at the coal face.

517
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,375
After all the blah, blah, blah,

518
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,667
you boys are where it actually happens.

519
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,708
I'd go so far as to say
you boys are the only thing that counts.

520
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,125
If it doesn't happen here,
it doesn't happen. End of story.

521
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,208
- Yes, son?
- If what doesn't happen, sir?

522
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,167
It, son.

523
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,792
Okay, thank you, sir.

524
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,917
Does anyone here know what "it" is?

525
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,375
Anyone?

526
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,917
Anyone?

527
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,833
To secure the area, sir.

528
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:48,417
To protect the people from the enemy
so they can go about building their lives.

529
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,542
Okay. Okay, thank you, Sergeant.

530
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:55,583
Okay, but I can't tell the difference
between the people and the enemy.

531
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,042
They all look alike to me.

532
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,542
I'm pretty sure
they're the same people, sir.

533
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,917
I understand it can be tough, son,
but that's the job.

534
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,583
I have another question.

535
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:11,042
I hear now they're giving out medals
for heroic restraint.

536
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,292
Do I have that right?

537
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,583
Courageous restraint.

538
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,792
And that is right.

539
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,250
Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir,

540
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,292
but I do not understand
what the fuck that means.

541
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,917
It means, son, that sometimes
when you're dealing with an insurgency,

542
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,375
you're not gonna be 100% clear
on who the enemy is.

543
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:36,500
It means you're gonna find yourself
in situations where,

544
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,417
when you're afraid or whatnot,

545
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,141
you're gonna have to make
a judgment call.

546
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:44,667
Because, as Sergeant Ortega here
has so rightly pointed out,

547
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,708
your mission is to protect the people,
not kill them.

548
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,625
We can't help them
and kill them at the same time.

549
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:55,208
It just ain't humanly possible.
Do you understand me?

550
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,125
No, not really, sir. No.

551
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,167
What part are you struggling
to comprehend, son?

552
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,875
I don't know, sir. It seems to me
that we all here with our guns and shit,

553
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:09,000
trying to convince these people that
deep down we're actually really nice guys.

554
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:12,750
And I don't know how to do that, sir,
when every second one of them

555
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,458
or every third one of them
or every tenth one of them

556
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,500
is trying to fucking kill me, sir.

557
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,625
'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.

558
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,750
And it seem like now
they handing out medals

559
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,083
for heroically not being a marine, sir.

560
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,750
I'm confused,
is what I'm trying to say, sir.

561
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:35,792
Well, then you're just gonna have
to get yourself unconfused, son.

562
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,625
<i>On the day</i>
<i>of the Afghan general elections,</i>

563
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,333
<i>for which Glen had waited so patiently,</i>

564
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,792
<i>Badi Bassim joined his team.</i>

565
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,958
<i>Cory wouldn't tell me
where he found Glen his Afghan mascot.</i>

566
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:01,208
No, I'm doing your job!

567
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,792
<i>He said he just found him
in the phone book.</i>

568
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,917
Put the bag down.

569
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,750
<i>I assume that was a joke.</i>

570
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,375
My name is Captain Badi Bassim.

571
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,458
I'm here to start work
with General McMahon.

572
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,750
- Who?
- McMahon.

573
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,625
- McMahon?
- Yeah.

574
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,083
- Why are you not wearing the uniform?
- My uniform is in my bag.

575
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,750
It's too dangerous for me to wear it
while I am walking here from my home.

576
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,833
Unzip it.

577
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,875
Unzip the bag.

578
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,458
My uniform.

579
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,042
- Why are you walking in here?
- Why I am working here?

580
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,792
Walking! Walking! Walking here?

581
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,625
Walking.

582
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,583
I like to walk.

583
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,583
Badi! Come in. Come in.

584
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:15,458
Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp,
Badi Bassim.

585
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,750
He's a soldier and a scholar.

586
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,125
This is the face of the new Afghanistan.

587
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:25,583
Greg, you know. That's Cory.
You know Cory. Pete Duckman.

588
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,667
And...

589
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,958
we got people here
from Spain and Italy and...

590
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,083
- You know, places like that.
- Okay.

591
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,292
- Have you voted?
- I wanted to report to you first.

592
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,458
- You haven't voted?
- No.

593
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,934
Good. Good. You can do it right here.

594
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,143
We got a polling booth right here,
right around the corner.

595
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,167
Okay.

596
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,000
- Election day. It's exciting.
- Yeah.

597
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,167
This is important, Badi.

598
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,458
That long line of men,
that slow shuffle there,

599
00:35:57,542 --> 00:36:00,125
that's the slow shuffle towards freedom.

600
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:06,125
The steps are small but, by God,
their importance...

601
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,208
It's like the moon landing.

602
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,208
Small step, giant leap. Yeah.

603
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:13,875
Are you familiar
with the moon landing, son?

604
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,375
- Yes, sir.
- It's like the goddamn moon landing.

605
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,875
Yes, sir, I agree. It's very important.

606
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,125
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.

607
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,625
- A what?
- We're gonna have another election.

608
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,542
We can't ignore these fraud allegations.

609
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,792
They're coming in
from every corner of the country

610
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:31,125
and everything points
to a ridiculous Karzai victory.

611
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,583
I mean, the whole thing
just smells stupid.

612
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:34,667
Sure.

613
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,583
Sure, there's gonna be irregularity
now and again.

614
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:43,708
But surely a result
is the best possible outcome. Yeah?

615
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:47,125
The polling station,
the one right there over where you are...

616
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:53,208
367 registered voters,
1,200 votes counted.

617
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:56,917
It's a joke.
We're going to a runoff election.

618
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,792
Tell them what you told me!

619
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,833
- About what, sir?
- About the elections.

620
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,500
About the whole concept of elections
in this country.

621
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:12,625
Well, I was just observing, sir,

622
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:15,917
that people don't quite
understand elections.

623
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,708
They see that the president is alive,
everything is okay.

624
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,851
So what's the big problem?
Why are we having an election?

625
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,875
Yeah.

626
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,439
And then you have an election anyway,

627
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,292
and people vote for whoever
the local leaders tell them to vote for.

628
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,375
Yeah.

629
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,658
Because they don't want to have
their heads chopped off.

630
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,542
See what I mean?

631
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:42,583
Thank you for that...

632
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,792
I'm sorry, Glen.
We're going to a runoff election.

633
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,458
Jesus H...

634
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,125
I got the White House sitting on my report
till after these elections get done.

635
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:59,417
I can't do anything until the president
approves my recommendations.

636
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,458
And now you're telling me that's not gonna
be until after another goddamn election?!

637
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:08,000
You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Karzai ain't that guy.

638
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,125
You gotta understand,

639
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,000
what we're trying to do here
is like raising a child.

640
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,333
And a child needs two parents.

641
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:23,458
Two parents who love it
and each other very much.

642
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,458
That's what it needs, above all else.

643
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:34,458
Well, then your wife, Mrs. Karzai...

644
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:38,750
I'm assuming that you're the daddy
in this metaphorical relationship...

645
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,375
We suspect your wife Karzai

646
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,208
might be a drug addict.

647
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:45,333
He eliminated his chief opponent
in this election

648
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,542
by spreading
a pretty vicious homosexual rumor,

649
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:51,292
and we're pretty sure that his brother
is a straight-up criminal warlord.

650
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,250
Oh, come on, Pat!

651
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,167
You got a bee in your bonnet.

652
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,958
You just don't like him for some reason,
whatever it is. And seriously...

653
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:04,250
Anyway, I wanna know,
how is Washington any different, huh?

654
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,625
Seriously! Tell me!

655
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah.

656
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:13,833
You can't.

Somebody leaked your report.
The Washington Post has a copy.

00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,333
No.

670
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:59,292
- Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
- Woodward? No.

671
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,792
Oh, my God almighty.
You find the source?

672
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,833
Sir, the source?

673
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:06,792
This is terrible.
Goddamn terrible news.

674
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,559
Do you hear that?
Someone leaked the assessment.

675
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,208
- Oh, terrible.
- Terrible. Shocking.

676
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,458
- Shocking.
- Shocking.

677
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:13,792
- Terrible.
- Shocking.

678
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, well...

679
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,125
I don't think it really matters
who leaked the assessment.

680
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,375
Question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

681
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,042
I wanna do the 60 Minutes interview.

682
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:31,250
Sir, as your senior PAO,
I must counsel strongly against it.

683
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,083
It would be foolhardy.

684
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:36,917
I really don't think
now's the time to court media attention.

685
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,643
At the very moment,
allegations are being made

686
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:42,333
- that you leaked this report yourself.
- I'm choosing to embrace the leak, Simon.

687
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:45,667
I don't seem to be getting any traction.
Do you know what I'm saying? Traction?

688
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,018
We got ourselves a president
who appears not to be aware of the fact

689
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,167
that the United States is
at war right now,

690
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,125
and he's that war's commander in chief.

691
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:56,375
- I gotta get me some traction.
- You need cut through.

692
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,292
Exactly. Cut through. You need to get me
some goddamn cut through.

693
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,750
I can handle that for you, sir.

694
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,875
Sorry. No offense, Simon,
how exactly are you gonna do that?

695
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,000
I'll quieten this whole situation down.

696
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:08,875
Again, I'm sorry,
I don't wanna start a fight here.

697
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,375
And please forgive me
for speaking for you, sir.

698
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:15,542
But the general didn't hire me
to make things quiet, okay?

699
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,708
Look, you're so good at your job,

700
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,833
but that job is basically
writing press releases.

701
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,625
Here's the thing about press releases.

702
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,375
Nobody reads 'em, okay?

703
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,667
They're boring.
And they're bullshit.

704
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,583
And everyone knows they're bullshit.

705
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:36,125
Correct me if I'm wrong,
you hired me to make some noise.

706
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:41,500
You know, the right kind of noise.
Our noise.

707
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,583
Pete.

708
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,208
- Boss.
- Move those vehicles to the right.

709
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:49,250
I wanna make sure the M-ATVs are
clearly visible in the background.

710
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,833
Copy that.

711
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,792
They're...
They're completely blocking them.

712
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,625
- This one?
- Both of them.

713
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,792
Just get 'em out of there.
Get 'em out of there!

714
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,958
Hey. How're we doing over here? Good?

715
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,226
- Great.
- You good? Good. Okay.

716
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,559
- Yeah, I think we're getting close.
- Oh, that's exciting.

717
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,542
I don't wanna interrupt.

718
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,667
I mean, I know you have your own
world of questions to ask in there.

719
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,292
You might wanna think about
asking the general...

720
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,583
how much face time
he's had with the president

721
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,333
since taking over the position.

722
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,500
Okay.

723
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,917
Yeah. You know, if you run out
of stuff to talk about or whatever.

724
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,542
You're welcome.

725
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:35,167
Yes, the leak was unfortunate.
There's no denying it.

726
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,875
It's unfortunate.

727
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,792
One would always choose
to mull these things over

728
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:44,375
in the sensible calm
of the proper quiet places.

729
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:48,417
But this war is tough. War is tough.

730
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:53,042
And the president
has tough decisions to make.

731
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,750
How many times have you spoken
to the president since you've been here?

732
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,417
Since I've been here in Afghanistan,
leading ISAF?

733
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Yes.

734
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:06,042
Once. I've spoken to the president once.
By video teleconference.

735
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,417
You've spoken to the president
once in, what, 70 days?

736
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,833
That's right.

737
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:13,042
You're the leader
of US forces in Afghanistan,

738
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,917
and you have spoken to the president
once in 70 days?

739
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,375
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why is that?

740
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,292
I don't know...

741
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,500
I'm guessing he's very busy.

742
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:28,958
Probably.

743
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,434
What the fuck's
the matter with you, Glen?

744
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,625
Are you out of your mind?

745
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,292
One second we're dealing
with this so-called fucking leak,

746
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,250
the next you're on the fucking television

747
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,792
backing the president into the most
ham-fisted corner I've ever seen.

748
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,083
I honestly believe you've made it
your sole mission to fuck me.

749
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,875
Well, Dick, I answered the questions
that were asked of me.

750
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,476
- I thought I was being fair.
- It's not a question of fair, Glen.

751
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,708
It's a question of what the fuck
were you doing on the television?

752
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:59,075
Why am I seeing you on the television?

753
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,833
Now we gotta fix this.

754
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:04,042
We gotta find a way
of taking the heat out of this thing.

755
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,167
Now you've gone and lit a fucking fire
under it! Do you understand?

756
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,542
- Yeah, I see.
- Here's where we're gonna start.

757
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,625
You're gonna get on the phone
to Bob Gates and...

758
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,792
Hang on, Dick. You're cutting out.
I can't hear you. Can you hear me?

759
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:17,542
Yeah, I can hear you.
And please stop calling me Dick!

760
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:20,542
Shit. Something's wrong.
I can't hear a word you're saying.

761
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,375
Let me... let me try this.

762
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,467
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

763
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,208
Okay, something's wrong here.
Hold on a minute, Dick.

764
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:34,375
- Oh, God.
- Andy, get your ass in here!

765
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,750
- Yes, sir.
- Got a problem.

766
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,393
I can't hear a word Dick's saying.

767
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:43,917
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.

768
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,583
- All right, can you hear us now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

769
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:57,208
- What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?
- Yeah, I can hear you!

770
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,875
I'm... I'm sorry.

771
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,000
- I'm sorry, Dick.
- Oh, gosh!

772
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,208
Can't hear a word you're saying.

773
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:07,083
Andy's gonna have to work on this,
and pronto!

774
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,250
- Yes, sir.
- This is goddamn unacceptable.

775
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,375
No, no, we need to talk.

776
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,625
I'll talk to you later, Dick.

777
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,917
We need to finish...
We need to finish this thing.

778
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,000
Well done.

779
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,833
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.

780
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:26,792
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

781
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:29,542
Thank you.

782
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,833
I wanna speak to you tonight
about our effort in Afghanistan.

783
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:37,792
It's an extraordinary honor for me
to do so here at West Point,

784
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:42,083
where so many men and women
have prepared to stand up for our security

785
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:45,792
and to represent
what is finest about our country.

786
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,125
As your commander in chief,

787
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:50,000
I owe you a mission
that is clearly defined...

788
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:53,208
- Yes, you do.
- And worthy of your service.

789
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:57,208
And that's why I insisted
on a thorough review of our strategy.

790
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:00,792
And as commander in chief,
I have determined that

791
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:03,458
it is in our vital national interest...

792
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,958
to send an additional 30,000 US troops
to Afghanistan.

793
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,833
After 18 months,
our troops will begin to come home.

794
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:14,042
I do not make this decision lightly.

795
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:20,750
We have been at war now for eight years,
at enormous cost in lives and resources.

796
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,851
Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism

797
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,625
have left our unity
on national security issues in tatters.

798
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:30,208
And having just experienced
the worst economic crisis

799
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:31,708
since the Great Depression,

800
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,958
the American people are
understandably focused on

801
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,417
rebuilding our economy
and putting people to work here at home.

802
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:48,083
Sir.

803
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:53,375
You got your troops.

804
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:00,500
Buddy here just announced

805
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,792
to the whole of Afghanistan
that we are about to abandon it!

806
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,476
That's like telling the bad guys
all they gotta do

807
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,180
is wait out the next 18 months

808
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,542
and then we'll be gone!

809
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:17,667
And so he just told an auditorium
full of young American soldiers

810
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,958
the war they've been asked to fight
these last eight years

811
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,083
has been nothing more than

812
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:25,792
one great monumental waste
of everybody's time.

813
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:30,167
That was a clusterfuckingly
stupid fucking speech!

814
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:34,542
Thank you, Greg.

815
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,208
Well, you heard him.

816
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:43,208
He's not giving us the full 40,000.
They're giving us 30.

817
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:44,958
I just got off the phone with the SecDef.

818
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,750
We gotta get the rest
from our coalition partners.

819
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,417
Looks like we're going to Europe, boys.
So pack your...

820
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,542
Oh, I don't know, fuck it!
Pack whatever it is they wear in Europe.

821
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,875
Speedos and shit! Willy.

822
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,875
<i>The world stage.</i>

823
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:16,417
<i>It's always seemed funny to me
how a man can go from looking at a map of,</i>

824
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,875
<i>I don't know, say Helmand province,</i>

825
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:23,708
<i>to finding himself in Europe
trying to persuade our friends and allies</i>

826
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:27,292
<i>that his crazy dream
is their crazy dream too.</i>

827
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,542
Bonjour, General.

828
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:30,833
Thank you.

829
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:32,833
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Hello.

830
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,167
Okay, so tomorrow afternoon,

831
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,958
you have the presentation
to l'École Militaire.

832
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:42,833
Tomorrow night,
dinner with the minister of defense.

833
00:48:42,917 --> 00:48:44,833
That is a gala dinner, by the way.

834
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:48,875
Just a heads-up so you can prepare
yourself mentally. It's a big one.

835
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,333
Meetings the next day.
Then we got the night free.

836
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:53,708
- And then to Berlin.
- Yeah.

837
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:59,375
Here we go.
Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.

838
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,833
They wanna know
if you can spare time for a meeting

839
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:04,333
on Air Force One tomorrow morning.

840
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,809
The president wants some face time.

841
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,958
Now he wants fucking face time.
Fucking dick.

842
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,333
So can you do that, boss?

843
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,833
Then we can jet across
to Copenhagen at zero six.

844
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:18,792
The president's gonna be
on the tarmac at 8:30.

845
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,917
Well, you're the keeper of my schedule,
Cory. You tell me if I can do it.

846
00:49:25,392 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay, yeah, we can have you back
in Paris early afternoon,

847
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:31,204
depending on how much time you two need.
And I can shift your morning meetings.

848
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,375
See that out there? I'm calling that dusk.

849
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,708
That's close of fucking business.

850
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,083
Boss, you good with this?

851
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:43,125
Sure, Pete. We're not in theater.
You boys earned it.

852
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:49,949
Sir, have you had a chance
to say hello to your wife yet?

853
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:51,726
You know, she checked in this morning.

854
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,042
I think she's waiting for you
in your room.

855
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,250
Shit. Right, I should do that.

856
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,601
What room am I in again?

857
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:01,917
- 517.
- What?

858
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,375
- Five-seven-one.
- Five-one-seven.

859
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,875
- Stop. Go.
- Five-one-seven.

860
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,375
Five-one-seven.

861
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,375
- Hi, boss.
- Hey, Willy.

862
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:33,083
- Hi. Hi, honey.
- Hi.

863
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,008
Hi.

864
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:36,958
I'm sorry, I've been delayed.

865
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:41,458
The president is wanting time
with me tomorrow,

866
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,167
and we've been trying to ascertain

867
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:47,708
whether... whether or not
we can accommodate this request.

868
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,268
I'm gonna leave you two be. I'll be...

869
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:54,250
- I'll be right next door.
- Okay, thank you, Willy.

870
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:06,125
Well, we're in Paris.

871
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:09,625
Yeah. Hopefully we'll get to see
some sights.

872
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:14,875
Yeah, I'll have Cory
schedule some time.

873
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:15,958
- Yeah.
- Okay...

874
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:18,242
but you do what you gotta do,
because I am here for you.

875
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:19,292
Oh, yeah?

876
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,208
- How's Tim?
- Oh, he's good. He's good.

877
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,958
- He sends his love.
- Okay.

878
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:29,750
He's got a new girlfriend now.

879
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,667
Yeah, I like her.

880
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,500
Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor
over at Leavenworth.

881
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,542
Yeah, she's sweet. You'll like her.

882
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,458
Well...

883
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:57,958
Well, I think it's just great you're
getting to see the president, honey.

884
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,667
You must be very excited, huh?

885
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,833
Hey, Glen.

886
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,083
Hope you don't mind me hitching a ride.
I'm on my own dash to see the president.

887
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,287
They told me you were heading
over there this morning.

888
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,750
No problem, Pat. My plane is your plane.

889
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,292
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks, Glen.

890
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:57,458
So my hope is, depending on how long
your meeting goes with the president,

891
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,875
we can have you back in Paris NLT 1400,

892
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,042
then straight to
the École Militaire for 1500.

893
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,375
My uniform will be crushed
after these flights.

894
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,042
I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.

895
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,184
I'm allowing for four solid hours
with the president.

896
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:10,476
If it's less than that,
we should be fine to go via the hotel.

897
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,625
I am just contingency planning
for the possibility

898
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:14,083
we may be running tight on time.

899
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,976
- Can we move the École Militaire back?
- Not really.

900
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,059
Gonna be a lot of people there.

901
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,924
We have the gala dinner right after.
We don't have any wiggle room here.

902
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,434
You should wear the fatigues
to the thing this afternoon.

903
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,875
The general, direct from the battlefield.

904
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,542
No need to shower
when you're straight from the fight.

905
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,667
- That's good.
- Yeah.

906
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:30,934
- It's very good.
- I like that.

907
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,292
Well, just make sure
Willy has my fatigues on standby.

908
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,208
Talking points for the president.

909
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:54,708
How you doing, Glen?

910
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,792
This one is a bitch, right?

911
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,875
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.

912
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:08,250
Right on.

913
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:12,375
Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down,
you were happier in Iraq.

914
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,250
A soldier leading soldiers.

915
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:22,958
Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Just a nice bubble of soldiers.

916
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:27,583
Just ordered. Right? 'Cause it has to be.

917
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:31,958
War is chaos, so then the army has to be
the opposite of chaos.

918
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:35,042
But now you find yourself
in the real world.

919
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,725
Now you're dealing with civilians,
and civilians don't make sense.

920
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,700
Not making sense is a luxury
I can't afford.

921
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,833
Lives depend on it.

922
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,708
- No, of course.
- Yeah.

923
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:49,917
Absolutely.

924
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,542
And you can't live in the bubble forever.

925
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,042
You gotta rise as your talents dictate.

926
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,917
What do you want, Pat?

927
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,208
How do you think this ends?

928
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:07,917
Simple. We either win it or we lose it.

929
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,042
Yeah, I don't know.

930
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,500
I think I'm gonna call bullshit
on that, Glen.

931
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:16,458
All the winning we were ever gonna do,
we did in the first six months.

932
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:18,342
And since then,
we've just been making a mess.

933
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,125
And that's all it was ever gonna be.

934
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:23,000
You're not here to win.

935
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:26,000
You're here to clean up the mess.

936
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,583
You'll get your 40,000 troops.

937
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:33,167
Get 'em in there. Get your PowerPoint
presentation in order, you know?

938
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,375
Just move the needle a little bit.

939
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,059
Show everyone how all the graphs are
pointing in the right direction.

940
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,875
That's all you gotta do.

941
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:43,042
That's how this ends best for you
anyway.

942
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,583
A nice-looking set of graphs.

943
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:50,500
Or a nicer-looking set of graphs
than the last set of graphs.

944
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,750
Either that or get yourself fired.

945
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:59,042
Then you can say "I told you so"
when it all turns to shit

946
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:03,250
or fizzles out or
however it is this thing ends.

947
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:07,583
There's no street parade
at the end of this one.

948
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,458
It's good to talk.

949
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,833
Everybody. How are you?

950
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:15,042
Morning.
Yeah, it's good to see you again.

951
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,708
- How you doing? Good to see you. Nice tie.
- Thank you.

952
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,500
All right. How's it going?

953
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:24,250
- Morning, sir. Nice to see you again.
- All right. Take care now.

954
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:25,643
It's good to see you,
Mr. President.

955
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:26,947
All right, see you soon.

956
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:31,250
- Mr. President.
- It's great to see you, General.

957
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:33,750
I'm sorry,
but we're running behind schedule.

958
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,851
I was looking forward to getting
some face time with you,

959
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,958
but I gotta get this baby in the air.

960
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,750
So all right.

961
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:42,958
Smile for the cameras, Glen.

962
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:47,833
All right.

963
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,083
Take care.

964
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,167
- Pat.
- Mr. President.

965
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,351
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

966
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,708
All right, Magnus, talk to you soon. Okay?

967
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,125
<i>You could argue</i>
<i>that the main reason</i>

968
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:12,458
<i>certain generals like war so much is...</i>

969
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,833
<i>well, because it's only in war
that they feel truly relevant.</i>

970
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:24,208
<i>It's only in war that they feel close
to the center of power.</i>

971
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:29,708
<i>Only in war do they feel
the warm glow of other people's attention.</i>

972
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,375
Good evening, sir.

973
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:34,917
<i>The attention of people like me.</i>

974
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,333
Okay, you know what?
You both look beautiful.

975
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:39,708
Really.

976
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:42,708
Sir, before you get dragged
into the hubbub there,

977
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:45,125
I want to introduce you
to Sean Cullen here.

978
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:48,417
Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.
He's been doing that profile piece on you.

979
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,750
He's gonna be tagging along
for a couple days.

980
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:53,125
Thanks for having me, sir.
It's a real privilege.

981
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:55,667
- Rolling Stone?
- Yes, sir.

982
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,030
Just make sure I'm on the cover.

983
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,667
Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.

984
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:05,000
Well, put me in a heart-shaped
bathtub with her.

985
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,976
Rose petals. Happy to share.

986
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,292
Glen, stop joking.

987
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,667
I'm deadly serious, son.
Put me on the cover.

988
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,500
Okay, here we are.
There's the boss. There's Mrs. Boss.

989
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,917
Oh, there's me. There's you.

990
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,125
Where's me?

991
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:33,667
I guess you're on a different table.
Better keep looking.

992
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,003
You serious?

993
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:39,875
- Sorry.
- Yes?

994
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:43,667
Excuse me.
I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.

995
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,875
Oh, hey, there. I'm sorry.
Pleased to meet you.

996
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,417
Dear.

997
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:10,250
Thank you. Hi.

998
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,125
General. Tom Howard, sir.

999
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:22,292
I'm the United States defense attaché
here in Paris.

1000
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,625
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife, Jeanie.

1001
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,542
Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?

1002
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,625
Oh, yes, very much. It's lovely.

1003
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:32,833
Isn't it? Have you managed to see
any museums or exhibitions?

1004
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:34,309
Have you done the Louvre?

1005
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,667
I think we're gonna be too busy
to see the Louvre.

1006
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:40,500
But I've been wandering around by myself
while Glen's at meetings, and...

1007
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:42,417
oh, my, it's... it's lovely.

1008
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,167
General, I thought it went very well
at the École Militaire today.

1009
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,833
I didn't get the opportunity
to introduce myself there.

1010
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:50,792
But there were some
very interesting people there today.

1011
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:53,833
If you'd like, I'd be very happy
to give you a rundown of the who's who

1012
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,684
if you get a little window
in your schedule while...

1013
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,458
I appreciate that.
My schedule's very tight.

1014
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:59,458
Of course. Totally understood.

1015
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:03,252
General, I could introduce you to some
people here tonight if you'd prefer.

1016
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:06,875
No, I think my team and I
have a grip on the who's who. Thank you.

1017
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:09,417
Cory, where's Badi?

1018
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,917
I don't know, boss.
He was here a minute ago.

1019
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,393
I thought he was supposed to be
sitting beside you and Jeanie.

1020
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:20,208
General, I thought it best if you and I
took this opportunity to talk, so...

1021
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:22,708
so I switched places
with your colleague over there, I...

1022
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:24,500
Like you said, your schedule's very tight.

1023
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:26,292
What'd you say your name was?

1024
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,417
Tom Howard, sir.

1025
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,500
What do you think this dinner is for,
Tom Howard?

1026
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:34,792
General, this dinner
is to honor you, sir.

1027
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,167
Wrong. This dinner is for Afghanistan.

1028
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,125
We are here tonight
because we're at war in Afghanistan.

1029
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:44,583
And you got the goddamn gall
to kick the only Afghan in the room

1030
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,083
- off my goddamn table?
- I'm sorry...

1031
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,542
Let me tell you what I want you to do,
Tom Howard.

1032
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,583
I want you to go sit your ass down

1033
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,417
wherever the fuck your ass was officially
designated to sit,

1034
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,125
and I want you to tell Badi
to bring his ass back over here!

1035
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,590
How's that sound, Tom Howard?

1036
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,333
I'm sorry, sir.

1037
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:06,250
Ma'am.

1038
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,042
I apologize for my language.

1039
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:14,868
- Everything's okay, honey.
- Boss?

1040
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:19,042
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here
is from Afghanistan.

1041
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,125
General.

1042
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:30,417
Sir.

1043
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,750
Swell.

1044
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:37,833
I don't want for this dinner
to be awkward for you, General,

1045
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:40,875
so I will tell you now
that we intend to give you

1046
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,917
our portion of the troops
that you request.

1047
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,292
I don't think the Germans will be so easy.

1048
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:51,708
I think that they are feeling
inclined to withdraw altogether.

1049
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:55,542
And I should add that

1050
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:59,042
I would hate for you to think
that France is easy.

1051
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:04,083
This must be a final moment, no?
We cannot stay in Afghanistan forever.

1052
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,292
No, we can't.

1053
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:09,958
That's why I'm gonna win it.

1054
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,458
Thank you.

1055
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,625
That was strange.

1056
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:08,375
Writing a biography, is that something
you might be open to? Or...

1057
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,208
For sure, yeah.
Something I'm absolutely open to...

1058
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:13,708
It's such a fascinating
subject matter.

1059
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:16,208
No offense, book could kinda write itself.

1060
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:19,125
We may have a problem
getting to Berlin tomorrow.

1061
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:21,917
This volcano in Iceland. It's...

1062
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:25,208
canceling all flights
because of the ash cloud.

1063
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:27,500
- Dude, we got our own plane.
- Guess this cloud's huge.

1064
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,417
Nothing's taking off in Europe.
They're grounding all air traffic.

1065
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,917
We got tonight free, right?

1066
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:36,125
Then what's the plan? We're drinking.
Tell me we're fucking drinking.

1067
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:44,542
Today is Jeanie and my's
30th wedding anniversary, so...

1068
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,625
I'm taking her to dinner.

1069
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,042
Just the two of you?

1070
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:52,167
Yes.

1071
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,292
It doesn't matter, honey. I've had fun.

1072
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:55,625
Good. Good.

1073
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,292
We'll come back again

1074
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:59,101
when everything's normal
and we can do it together.

1075
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,142
Sure.

1076
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,792
We're together.

1077
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:06,708
Yeah.

1078
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:09,625
This is so special.

1079
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:17,333
You know, the other day
I was calculating the...

1080
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:23,000
I was working out that we've spent less
than 30 days a year together

1081
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,000
for the last eight years.

1082
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,625
And...

1083
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:38,292
I was just thinking
that it's really interesting,

1084
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,917
the way things happen.

1085
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:47,000
Well, if we hadn't gone to war...

1086
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,042
if September 11th hadn't happened...

1087
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:54,083
if America hadn't been attacked
and we hadn't gone to war,

1088
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:58,042
I'd probably be barbecuing something
in our backyard right now.

1089
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:01,417
But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?

1090
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,958
Yes. Yes, I know. I know.
I know, and I am... I'm sorry.

1091
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:09,458
- I didn't say that to make you feel bad.
- Why are you thinking about it?

1092
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:12,167
No, I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not thinking about it, I promise.

1093
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,417
Yes, you are. You're calculating days.

1094
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,292
You just told me, one day
you sat yourself down with a calendar

1095
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,875
and you calculated days.

1096
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,958
Yes, I know. I know.
But I just did that because...

1097
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,292
I did it because
I was proud of you, honey.

1098
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,500
I'm proud of me too. You know?

1099
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,333
Yeah, I'm proud of me too.

1100
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,333
Do you know?

1101
01:06:58,125 --> 01:06:59,583
Oh, honey.

1102
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:02,292
No, honey, look at me.

1103
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:07,667
Everything's gonna be okay.

1104
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,083
I know.

1105
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:25,500
Yes, every... everything...

1106
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,333
Everything's okay.

1107
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:31,750
Yeah.

1108
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,375
Obama's not a leader.

1109
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,708
He's an orator.

1110
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,167
He hammered the whole world on.
Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

1111
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:45,667
Really, it's no, we can't.

1112
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:46,750
Yeah.

1113
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:49,583
We can't do Iraq.

1114
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:54,125
He's loud and clear now
that we can't do Afghanistan.

1115
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,958
We can't do Gitmo.

1116
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:58,458
Where the fuck else
we gonna put all these motherfuckers?

1117
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:02,708
That's a great orator. Right there.

1118
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:05,375
He's sold us on, like a double negative.

1119
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,500
Yes, we can not do things.

1120
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:12,917
You know? Or is that a double negative?

1121
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Not really, but I know what you mean.

1122
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,958
Yo, look who it is!

1123
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,083
Hey.

1124
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,667
- Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Boss.

1125
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,208
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1126
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:30,083
Boss and Mrs. Boss, down there.

1127
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:31,417
- You, drink!
- No, no.

1128
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,208
- You, drink!
- Down the hatch.

1129
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:38,083
Sir, I just want to say again
what a privilege this is.

1130
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,875
You must be really proud.

1131
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:43,958
- You must be really proud of him.
- Oh, yes, I am.

1132
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:48,875
- Ah, here we go! Here we go!
- Oh, yeah!

1133
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,625
Go, Pete!

1134
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:55,417
Come on!
I got your name all over this.

1135
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,250
I always loved this asshole!

1136
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,792
- We're not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?

1137
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:10,542
- Not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?

1138
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:13,917
They won't give us clearance
to fly to Berlin tomorrow.

1139
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,958
USA! Everybody now!

1140
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:18,667
USA! USA!

1141
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:23,333
This is bullshit.
It's like one phone call.

1142
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:26,125
Hello, they won't let us take off.
Can you fix it?

1143
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:30,167
Oh, no, monsieur.
Big volcano. No take off.

1144
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,708
Well, this is General Glen McMahon
we're talking about here.

1145
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,625
Oh, General Glen McMahon.

1146
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:37,167
Oh, I did not know.
Why didn't you say that?

1147
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,018
Pardon, monsieur,
of course you may take off.

1148
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,417
- Done! How hard is that?
- I've made the calls. Believe me.

1149
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,792
Listen,
we are the fucking US military.

1150
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,083
We practically invented everything!

1151
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:47,967
And now we have
some chinless fuck in Brussels

1152
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,792
who's telling us
we can't fly our own plane

1153
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:52,292
because of a volcano in Greenland.

1154
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,625
What are we supposed to do?

1155
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:56,250
Sit around here in Paris
and wait for it to "stop erupting"?

1156
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,143
I don't know, Greg. This isn't exactly
a situation that I've been in before.

1157
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,375
Okay, bear with me on this one.

1158
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,583
I think I might have
just solved our problem.

1159
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:59,458
<i>I really can't tell you why</i>
<i>these guys got so loose in front of me.</i>

1160
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,833
<i>Or why Glen let them get so loose.</i>

1161
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:06,250
<i>I can only put it down to hubris.</i>

1162
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:12,125
<i>These guys thought they were
the most important guys in the world...</i>

1163
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:15,083
<i>with the most important jobs in the world.</i>

1164
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:20,875
<i>Maybe they assumed I thought
they were as amazing as they did.</i>

1165
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:23,708
What are you writing?

1166
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:28,417
What are you writing?
You're always writing. I don't like it.

1167
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,708
<i>Maybe they thought</i>
<i>they could do whatever they wanted.</i>

1168
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:32,958
I'm a writer.

1169
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,583
I write.

1170
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,667
I better like what it is you're writing.

1171
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,917
Let's say you have ten insurgents.

1172
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:49,625
Now, let's say you kill two of 'em.

1173
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:54,417
Now, how many insurgents do you have left?

1174
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:59,833
Well, you'd say eight, of course.

1175
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:03,292
Eight. Right?

1176
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,417
Right?

1177
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,250
Wrong!

1178
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,708
In this scenario, ten minus two equals 20.

1179
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,958
Let's say the two insurgents
you just killed...

1180
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:24,292
each had six friends or brothers
or some such,

1181
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:29,792
who are hovering on the brink of
joining the insurgency.

1182
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,542
They're thinking
about this insurgency thing.

1183
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:39,083
Looks interesting. But, you know,
for one reason or other, not for me.

1184
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:44,042
But... So, then you go
and kill their friend.

1185
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:47,250
Now you've just made up
their minds for 'em.

1186
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:53,792
Those hovering friends are now
full, paid-up members of the enemy.

1187
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:54,917
Yeah.

1188
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And so, in the math of counterinsurgency,

1189
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,833
ten minus two...

1190
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,250
equals 20.

1191
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:07,417
Yes, ma'am?

1192
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,042
General, the US invaded Afghanistan

1193
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:14,000
because of the al-Qaeda attacks
on September 11th.

1194
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:17,042
- This is correct, yes?
- Yeah.

1195
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:19,917
You have been speaking to us now
for 45 minutes...

1196
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,958
Oh, where's the... Oh, thank you.

1197
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,875
Thank you.

1198
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:35,333
You have been
speaking to us now for 45 minutes,

1199
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:39,167
and yet in all of that time you have
only mentioned al-Qaeda once.

1200
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,958
Your own vice president has advocated

1201
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:46,000
a much smaller
and simpler counterterrorism approach

1202
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,625
to incapacitate what is estimated to be

1203
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:53,542
little more than 100 al-Qaeda fighters
that still remain in Afghanistan

1204
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:58,417
to refocus on what it was
that started this war in the first place.

1205
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:02,333
Your analysis of the insurgency there

1206
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:05,583
suggests to me
there is no monolithic Taliban.

1207
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:07,750
You are spread over the entire country.

1208
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:11,292
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles
with locals

1209
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:13,958
whose principal ideological position

1210
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:17,792
would seem to be simply that they don't
want foreign soldiers in their village.

1211
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:22,000
And that, General, you must know,
is a war you will never win.

1212
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,625
with all due respect, ma'am...

1213
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,167
I must beg to differ.

1214
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,000
I firmly believe,

1215
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:37,208
having traveled to all corners
of the country,

1216
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:42,208
having spoken with many people
from many walks of life...

1217
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:49,000
that what these people want is the very
same thing that you and I want.

1218
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:56,750
Freedom, security, stability, jobs.

1219
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:02,792
Progress is being made. Real progress.

1220
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,667
But challenges do remain.

1221
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,000
Yes,
I understand all of that, General.

1222
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,250
And... and, please,
let me say quite sincerely

1223
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:13,417
that I do not question
the goodness of your intent.

1224
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,542
I have been listening to you
here this morning, and...

1225
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:18,875
I believe you are a good man.

1226
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:21,042
I do.

1227
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:25,250
What I question is...

1228
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:31,917
your belief in your power
to deliver these things that you describe.

1229
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:36,958
I question your belief in the power
of your ideals.

1230
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:38,250
Ah, well...

1231
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:42,250
I think
what I am trying to say,

1232
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:45,417
and I apologize, General,
if this is sounding impolite,

1233
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,667
but I question your sense of self.

1234
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:54,375
No, no, no, that's all... all right.

1235
01:15:56,292 --> 01:16:00,875
I appreciate your commentary.

1236
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,917
I do...

1237
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,292
But I have a job to do.

1238
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,958
Yes, I understand.
And I also have a job to do.

1239
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,708
And I am trying to do mine.

1240
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:13,375
As an elected representative
of the people of Germany,

1241
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:17,542
it is my job to ensure
that the personal ambitions

1242
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:21,167
of those who serve those people
are kept in check.

1243
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:25,833
You have devoted your entire life,
General, to the fighting of war.

1244
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:28,833
And this situation
in Afghanistan, for you,

1245
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,958
it is the culmination
of all your years of training,

1246
01:16:32,042 --> 01:16:33,958
all your years of ambition.

1247
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:37,042
- This is the great moment of your life.
- Well...

1248
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:41,000
It's understandable to me
that you should have, therefore,

1249
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:45,875
a fetish for completion
to make your moment glorious.

1250
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:50,500
It is my job, however,
to ensure that your personal ambitions

1251
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,542
are not entirely delusional

1252
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:56,625
and do not carry with them
an unacceptable cost for everybody else.

1253
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,500
- Honey, you okay?
- I'm fine.

1254
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:14,583
Please don't shut down.

1255
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:16,708
It's our last day together.

1256
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:19,708
Be here with me.

1257
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:47,708
One second. Thank you.

1258
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:52,083
So, just got an email from Gates.
Good news and bad news.

1259
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:56,083
Spoke with the German defense minister.
We're getting our troops.

1260
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,083
Turns out that crazy bitch
lady back there

1261
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,667
was just some sad, lonely voice
in the wilderness.

1262
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,500
Bad news is,
they won't let their guys leave the base.

1263
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,125
Whatever that means.

1264
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:10,167
But, hey, they're ponying up.
So I guess job here is done.

1265
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:14,917
Boss?

1266
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:28,167
<i>I used to think that men went gray</i>
<i>because they had stressful jobs</i>

1267
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,375
<i>with stressful decisions to make.</i>

1268
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,375
<i>Now, I think it happens
when men start to feel in their bones</i>

1269
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:38,583
<i>that the great moments of their lives...</i>

1270
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,875
<i>might not turn out to be quite as great
as they'd always hoped.</i>

1271
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:47,500
<i>When the real world starts creeping in.</i>

1272
01:18:56,167 --> 01:19:00,542
<i>What separates the believers like Glen
from everybody else is...</i>

1273
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,417
<i>their ability to block
this real world out.</i>

1274
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:13,708
<i>Some people call this insanity.</i>

1275
01:19:50,542 --> 01:19:52,708
Welcome to Operation Moshtarak.

1276
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:58,250
We're taking the Helmand province,
gentlemen, once and for all.

1277
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:03,958
Moshtarak will be the largest operation
yet to be conducted since this war began.

1278
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:08,125
So, needless to say,
it is an important one.

1279
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:14,250
This whole province has been
a thorn in our ass since day one.

1280
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:18,792
So this here will be a definitive test
in our resolve.

1281
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:22,667
And that starts right here in Marjah.

1282
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:27,375
If we infill teams here and here tonight,
we can set up our blocking positions,

1283
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:30,167
hopefully draw enough wiggle room
for the marines tomorrow.

1284
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,583
- Good.
- The forecast says tonight's the night.

1285
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:35,267
If we don't go in tonight,
likely have to wait maybe another week.

1286
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:38,476
I want Karzai to sign off on this.
Cory, can you get him on the phone?

1287
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,667
Copy.

1288
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,333
And why these spots?

1289
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,292
ISR is telling us these locations

1290
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:45,917
are where there still appears to be
a concentration of movement.

1291
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,768
Obviously, we're proceeding
under the assumption

1292
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:51,750
that anyone who isn't a bad guy
has moved on or at least hunkered down.

1293
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:54,184
We've made it clear
to the whole city that's the thing to do.

1294
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,089
If I could just ask
a question, General.

1295
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,167
Shoot!

1296
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,083
I know this is Marjah,
but I'm still not quite clear

1297
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:03,625
as to why you're sending boys
to Nawzad and Musa Qala.

1298
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,458
I mean, there's nothing out there.

1299
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:09,500
I'm just not quite clear what it is
you're trying to control there.

1300
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,500
Apart from nothing.

1301
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,167
You see this map, Frank?

1302
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:20,667
This one, hmm?

1303
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:24,208
This here is the mess
I'm having to clean up.

1304
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:29,542
Now, we've been kind enough
to plan this operation in such a way

1305
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:32,833
as to not make it look like the Americans
are here to get done what you couldn't.

1306
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,583
But that is what's happening.

1307
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,700
So, Frank...

1308
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:43,500
while your input is greatly appreciated...

1309
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:44,583
It is.

1310
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:48,000
I wouldn't want you to think
that it isn't. It is.

1311
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:53,250
I'd also appreciate if you would take
one nice, big step back

1312
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,042
and let me get this shit done.

1313
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:57,958
Yeah. Yeah?

1314
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,125
- What?
- I can't get him.

1315
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,518
They're telling me
he's in bed with a cold.

1316
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:01,976
Well, did you tell 'em what it's about?

1317
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,393
I didn't tell 'em exactly
what it was about.

1318
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:05,351
- I said it was very important.
- Jesus H. Christ.

1319
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,625
- Just dial the number again. I'll talk.
- Right. Copy.

1320
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,250
Thanks, Bernie.
Let's assume this is happening.

1321
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:13,768
I'll give you the green light
soon as I get it.

1322
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:15,712
- Yes, sir.
- I have General McMahon on the line.

1323
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:21,875
Hello, who am I speaking with?
This is General McMahon.

1324
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:24,625
I need to speak
to President Karzai urgently.

1325
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:26,851
I understand he's not feeling well,
but I need to speak with him.

1326
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:27,917
Is he awake?

1327
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,000
Good. Put him on. Put the call through.

1328
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,625
What do you mean, he doesn't have one?

1329
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,917
What world leader
doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?

1330
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,143
Does he have a cell phone in there?

1331
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:38,809
- Did you try his cell phone?
- Straight to voice mail.

1332
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:39,958
What?

1333
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:43,083
Well, tell him to turn it back on.
Please! Please!

1334
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,500
This is... I can't...

1335
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:48,000
Oh, fuck it! I'm coming over there.

1336
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:51,458
This is me doing that right now.
I'm making the appointment right now.

1337
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,792
Yes?

1338
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,667
- Oh, General, please come in.
- Mr. President.

1339
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:12,750
Please sit here.

1340
01:23:13,917 --> 01:23:16,458
Please, please sit. Sit.

1341
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,875
- How are you?
- I'm fine, sir.

1342
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,458
I've been trying to contact you.

1343
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:29,292
Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.

1344
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:31,000
I understand, sir.

1345
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:33,208
But did they not tell you this is urgent?

1346
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:37,917
Oh, you know how everything is
at the top of the mountain, General.

1347
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,500
Everybody's urgent
about everything all the time.

1348
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:45,000
Everything is important.
Nothing ever really is.

1349
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:49,167
There's nothing
that cannot wait until morning.

1350
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,083
This is important, sir.

1351
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:54,458
We hope to launch
Operation Moshtarak tonight,

1352
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:56,500
and I need your official consent
before doing so.

1353
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:57,667
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

1354
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,208
- Why?
- Because it's your mission.

1355
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:00,292
- It is?
- Yes, sir.

1356
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:07,208
No one has ever asked me
to approve a mission before.

1357
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:11,458
Well, that needs to change.
This mission needs your consent.

1358
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:13,458
If we're to win the trust
of Helmand province,

1359
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:17,583
it demands that this mission
be seen to be of your design.

1360
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:18,792
I...

1361
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:24,125
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President,

1362
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:29,167
but it is imperative that you begin
to take a leadership role here.

1363
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,417
We cannot win this thing alone.

1364
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,083
Without your active involvement,

1365
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:36,667
our presence here will never be anything
more than a foreign occupation.

1366
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:41,125
This is your war.
For your country. Your people.

1367
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,542
Again, I'm sorry, sir...

1368
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,125
but you need to behave like a leader.

1369
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,167
But I am behaving like a leader.

1370
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,583
I'm unavailable.

1371
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:58,875
I am as unavailable to you
as is your own president.

1372
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:05,125
You have my approval, General.

1373
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:09,792
We both know it was never really
mine to give. But...

1374
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:16,500
I thank you for inviting me
to participate in the theater of it all.

1375
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,083
And good luck.

1376
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:23,083
I wish you much success.

1377
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:41,833
Good luck tonight, Glen.

1378
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
Who told you about tonight?

1379
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:50,208
I just mean...

1380
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:52,708
whatever you happen to find yourself
doing tonight,

1381
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:54,625
good luck with it.

1382
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:57,833
Go fuck yourself, Pat.

1383
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:01,292
Glen? Glen.

1384
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:05,083
What?

1385
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:06,750
Look, I just want to apologize.

1386
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:09,250
You know how the other day

1387
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,226
I said there wasn't a parade
at the end of all this?

1388
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,500
I was wrong. It was glib.

1389
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:16,292
I just thought it was a pithy way
to end the conversation,

1390
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:17,375
but I was wrong.

1391
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:20,583
There's gonna be thousands of parades.

1392
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:23,375
Thousands of 'em all over America.

1393
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:27,250
Only none of them will be for you.

1394
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:32,833
Now that was pithy too, but it was true.

1395
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:35,667
Fuck you!

1396
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:37,667
Roger that.

1397
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,110
What was that about, buddy?

1398
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:42,375
Nothing. Let's get to Kandahar.
We got some fucking winning to do.

1399
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:46,958
Okay, listen up.

1400
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,458
This is going to be tough.

1401
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,792
I'm not gonna mince words about that.

1402
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,875
This will be tough.

1403
01:26:57,583 --> 01:27:01,375
This will probably be the toughest mission
that any of you all will experience.

1404
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,750
This is the real deal.

1405
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:07,000
Marjah is Taliban ground zero.

1406
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,833
This is gonna be IEDs everywhere.

1407
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:13,292
This is gonna be their best guys.

1408
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,167
And they are gonna be prepared.

1409
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:19,875
They know we're coming, gentlemen.

1410
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:25,333
They've known we're coming for weeks.
So don't be under any illusion.

1411
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:27,458
This will get ugly.

1412
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,500
We're gonna lose guys.

1413
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:34,625
I am not gonna lie to you about that.
There will be casualties.

1414
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:40,125
But if you keep your wits about you,

1415
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:44,375
if you have faith in your ability,

1416
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:47,750
if you have faith in the ability
of the men next to you,

1417
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:50,792
you will come out the tail end of this!

1418
01:27:51,708 --> 01:27:53,750
I have faith in you!

1419
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,083
I know who you are!

1420
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:59,917
You are proud members
of the toughest fucking fighting force

1421
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,958
this world has ever known.
Carry that knowledge with you!

1422
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:07,542
Carry it with pride!
Do you understand me?

1423
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,033
Do you understand me?

1424
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:12,917
That's right.

1425
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:18,958
Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask
this chaplain to say a prayer for us.

1426
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:21,208
Thank you, Captain.

1427
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:25,875
Let us pray!

1428
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:32,292
Almighty God,
as these marines prepare for battle,

1429
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:35,458
we pray that your Holy Spirit
shall guide them.

1430
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:39,708
As you brought down the walls of Jericho,

1431
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:42,583
as you dealt out your wrath
upon the Philistines,

1432
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:44,375
as you crushed the Hittites

1433
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:47,875
and brought retribution upon
all the enemies of the righteous,

1434
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:53,125
may your mighty hand be upon these men
and assure their victories.

1435
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,917
Be with them, mighty God...

1436
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:28,167
Let's move.

1437
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:47,282
What are you thinking about, buddy?

1438
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:53,458
Well, let's just see
how this plays out.

1439
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,292
The uncrackable nut.

1440
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:01,875
If anyone's gonna crack this,
it's gonna be you.

1441
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,833
You're gonna smash this
like a monkey on a rock.

1442
01:30:07,917 --> 01:30:09,042
Yeah.

1443
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:17,825
You're a killing machine, Glen.

1444
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:21,833
You are the terrorist hunter.

1445
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:24,708
Remember?

1446
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:31,292
You're Big Glen.

1447
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:34,792
You're the Glenimal.

1448
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:46,042
Thank you, General.

1449
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:25,458
I'm hungry.

1450
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:27,333
I wanna eat that motherfucker.

1451
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:29,000
Jesus Christ, man.

1452
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:34,875
Farrenberg.

1453
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:45,917
Move.

1454
01:31:56,167 --> 01:31:58,375
Contact front!

1455
01:31:58,458 --> 01:31:59,726
Move! Move! Up against the wall!

1456
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,851
- Farrenberg.
- Not too close.

1457
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:02,583
Get off the walls. Now!

1458
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:12,500
- Fuck!
- Over there, twelve o'clock!

1459
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:15,292
Cole! Cole!

1460
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:17,975
I need to see a weapon.
He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.

1461
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:20,167
Fuck, man!
You think this nigga on his morning jog?

1462
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:23,458
All right. All right.

1463
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:25,309
We're gonna head to that house
over there at two o'clock.

1464
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:26,684
All right? We're gonna work this shit out.

1465
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,125
Cutter, I need you,
Song, Carroll and Trey,

1466
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:32,169
head over there and get us in, all right?
We're gonna move up to cover you.

1467
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,750
I need ANA guys going in first.

1468
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,583
Trey! You take those first two guys
with you. Copy?

1469
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:41,625
You two, up! Up! Get the fuck up!

1470
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:42,708
Move in.

1471
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:44,583
Come on! Let's go!

1472
01:32:48,792 --> 01:32:49,792
Clear.

1473
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,250
Put that gun up, now.

1474
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,667
We're getting ready to move now.

1475
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,750
Come on!

1476
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:17,083
Come on. Fucking move! Come on!

1477
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:18,750
Zah, zah, zah, you fuck!

1478
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:20,333
Oh, you fat piece of shit!

1479
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:22,625
Fucking move! Move!

1480
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:26,667
Move!

1481
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,333
To the right!

1482
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,167
- Clear!
- All right!

1483
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,250
All clear!

1484
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:40,250
Okay. Farrenberg, let's go!

1485
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,250
Move. Go in.

1486
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:46,875
All right.

1487
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,875
Listen up.

1488
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,083
We're gonna get on the roof of this place,
figure out what we're looking at.

1489
01:33:53,167 --> 01:33:56,000
Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.

1490
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:58,333
The rest of you guys stay put. Copy?

1491
01:33:58,417 --> 01:33:59,417
Copy.

1492
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,167
Comin' up!

1493
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:04,208
We got movement, twelve o'clock.

1494
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:06,458
About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.

1495
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:09,125
- Are they armed?
- I don't know.

1496
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:11,476
It's a simple fucking question, Trey.
Do you see a weapon?

1497
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,518
No. That's not what you asked.
You asked if they were armed.

1498
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:15,059
The answer to that one is,
I don't fucking know.

1499
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,268
Obviously they're armed, Ortega.

1500
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,132
Why else would they be
running around up there?

1501
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,958
I don't fucking know, do I?
I don't understand these fucking people.

1502
01:34:21,042 --> 01:34:23,125
All I know is we need to see weapons.

1503
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,601
- Are you hit? Are you hit?
- Fuck!

1504
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,309
- I'm fucking hit!
- Where are you hit?

1505
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:30,375
On my fucking eyes.

1506
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:32,559
- Can you open 'em?
- What the fuck is going on? Is he hit?

1507
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,518
We're good. We're good.
Trey's just got shit in his eyes.

1508
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:35,542
Hey, yo, guys!

1509
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:38,250
- Cutter, get the fuck over here!
- Fuck!

1510
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,513
It's just water. It's just water.

1511
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:42,226
Give us... Give me the 203.
Give me the 203.

1512
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,451
- Trey, stay still!
- Give me your fucking gun!

1513
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:48,292
Ortega! What's going on up there?
What the fuck's going on up there, guys?

1514
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:50,917
Cover!

1515
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:52,542
Fuck.

1516
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:00,667
Fucking short, man!

1517
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:02,458
Fuck.

1518
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:07,917
- Again!
- Zah!

1519
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,292
- Short!
- I know.

1520
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:16,542
One more!

1521
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:26,167
Fuck, yeah!

1522
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:30,667
Good job, Cole.

1523
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:33,333
Nice shooting, boys.

1524
01:35:36,292 --> 01:35:37,917
- Farrenberg, you hit?
- Nah.

1525
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,250
- Are you hit?
- No. I'm good.

1526
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,500
Fuck.

1527
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:46,250
- Fuck this shit!
- Cole, where the fuck are you going?

1528
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:48,226
- Dude, where the fuck are you going?
- Fuck off!

1529
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:51,250
- Corporal, what's happening?
- Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?

1530
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,375
- Shut the fuck up!
- Wait, Cole! Cole!

1531
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:55,792
- Cole! Get back here, Cole!
- Cole!

1532
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:58,000
Cole, what the fuck, man?
Where you going?

1533
01:35:58,083 --> 01:35:59,434
Where the fuck
are you going, man?

1534
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,667
- Fuck, Cole!
- Come back, Cole!

1535
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,625
Cole!

1536
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:43,583
They're crawling.
They're in the middle of an IED belt.

1537
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:45,667
And first and second platoons,
they're pinned down,

1538
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,667
and second is close to requesting QRF.

1539
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,708
Tell me something good, Cory.

1540
01:38:50,792 --> 01:38:52,434
I'm trying.
This info ain't meeting me halfway.

1541
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:54,059
I wanna hear something good, God damn it.

1542
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:57,292
I don't want the word "clusterfuck"
featuring anywhere in tomorrow's news.

1543
01:38:58,792 --> 01:39:00,352
Don't worry about the headlines, buddy.

1544
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:13,000
We got civilian casualties.

1545
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:18,500
We got civilian casualties
southeast corner of town, third platoon.

1546
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:22,500
It's those boys from Sasquatch.

1547
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:32,250
Cutter, find out
who these fucking guys are.

1548
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:34,143
If they're gonna stand there,
I wanna know who they are.

1549
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:35,500
How?

1550
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:37,625
Get one of the ANA to talk to 'em.

1551
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:42,708
Them motherfuckers speak Pashto.
The ANA don't speak Pashto.

1552
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:44,375
I don't know. Figure it out.

1553
01:39:46,042 --> 01:39:47,167
The fuck...

1554
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:55,917
Cutter's fucking shit up outside.

1555
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:02,934
- All right. What's the deal here?
- He's saying he didn't know the bad guys.

1556
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:05,999
They just commandeered his house, and
there was nothing he could do about it.

1557
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:09,250
Well, that's fucking bullshit.
We did leaflet drops and shit.

1558
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:11,250
He shouldn't still be here.

1559
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,614
Why are you still here?
What's your reason for being here?

1560
01:40:28,292 --> 01:40:31,208
He says that he has
nowhere to go. He has no wife.

1561
01:40:31,292 --> 01:40:35,333
He is worried about leaving his goats.
He says that he's telling the truth.

1562
01:40:35,417 --> 01:40:37,667
You can search his house.
You will find no weapons.

1563
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,333
Wait.

1564
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:45,667
Farrenberg? Farrenberg!

1565
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:48,042
- Yeah, I'm here!
- Come here!

1566
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:51,042
We're gonna give this guy
some money, all right?

1567
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:52,684
- You fucking serious?
- Yeah, I am serious.

1568
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:55,125
Give me the fucking...
Open the fucking bag.

1569
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:59,542
- What are those, 2.5?
- Yeah.

1570
01:41:00,292 --> 01:41:01,458
Okay, give me one of those.

1571
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:31,792
My name is General Glen McMahon.
On behalf of the coalition forces,

1572
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:36,583
I wanna apologize to you
for the loss you've suffered here today.

1573
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:48,500
I know the money that Sergeant Ortega
gave you can't bring back your family.

1574
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:52,625
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild,

1575
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:54,667
because rebuilding
is what we're all about.

1576
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,125
And providing you
with the security you need

1577
01:41:57,208 --> 01:42:00,750
to live a long and prosperous life.

1578
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,708
Roads and schools
and then jobs, so...

1579
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:19,083
you can raise your families,
and jobs so you can put food on the table.

1580
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:29,583
The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.

1581
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:33,792
The Taliban aren't here to help you.
Only we can help you.

1582
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:41,875
We have a saying in America.

1583
01:42:43,208 --> 01:42:46,417
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

1584
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:55,833
I understand that sometimes it can be hard
to see the helping hand,

1585
01:42:55,917 --> 01:42:59,000
what with all the guns
and the strange guys

1586
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:00,833
and the mess and what have you.

1587
01:43:05,917 --> 01:43:10,042
But I assure you,
this is the hand of helping.

1588
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:11,625
This is the helping hand.

1589
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,250
Yeah.

1590
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:34,833
He says that he likes roads and schools,
but when you leave,

1591
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:37,750
it will all mean nothing
and they will be left in a big mess.

1592
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:39,500
And every day that you spend here longer,

1593
01:43:39,583 --> 01:43:41,343
the worse it will be for them
when you leave.

1594
01:43:41,417 --> 01:43:43,625
So please, leave now.

1595
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:46,125
Please.

1596
01:43:46,917 --> 01:43:49,417
I understand your concerns.
I really do. That's...

1597
01:43:53,417 --> 01:43:56,875
That's why we're doing everything
we can to bring peace,

1598
01:43:56,958 --> 01:43:59,792
and to train up your own Afghan forces.

1599
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:08,583
So that they can maintain
your security...

1600
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:12,333
well into the future.

1601
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,667
Please, leave now.

1602
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:34,292
Dragonfly, this is Spartan Two.
Think we're ready to roll.

1603
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:45,667
Give 'em hell, boys!

1604
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:48,583
Kill those motherfuckers! Eat 'em alive!

1605
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:59,917
Jesus Christ, Willy. What time is it?

1606
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,375
It's me, boss.

1607
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:03,292
Sorry to wake you.

1608
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,083
We have a problem.

1609
01:47:06,792 --> 01:47:11,292
That Rolling Stone article came out,
and it's not good.

1610
01:47:38,042 --> 01:47:40,625
Sir, it says we're shit-talking
our president.

1611
01:47:42,917 --> 01:47:44,333
And our vice president.

1612
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:48,750
That we don't have the support
of our coalition partners.

1613
01:47:52,042 --> 01:47:54,167
And that we're drunk all over Europe.

1614
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:03,250
Basically, a fucking drinking tour.
All over Europe.

1615
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:07,208
I mean, I don't even know what the legals
on a thing like this are, you know?

1616
01:48:07,292 --> 01:48:08,976
Nothing he says in there
is actually untrue.

1617
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,184
I'll get the editor on the phone
as soon as it's morning there

1618
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:15,875
and see if there's anything they can do.
I'm not sure what that's gonna be, though.

1619
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:18,375
Bottom line,
this is gonna play bad, all right?

1620
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:21,958
It's gonna play really fucking bad.
So we are in damage control now.

1621
01:48:22,042 --> 01:48:24,875
Guys, guys... Is this really that bad?

1622
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,833
I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure. But...

1623
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:31,542
this is Rolling Stone, okay? It's hip.

1624
01:48:31,625 --> 01:48:34,292
And you guys...
You guys are the operators.

1625
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:35,625
You know, you're out there,

1626
01:48:35,708 --> 01:48:40,542
you're getting shit done in like
a totally non-square way.

1627
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:43,250
Yes, Little, you fucking idiot,
it's that bad.

1628
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:44,934
This was always a terrible idea.

1629
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:47,917
Why you would unnecessarily
court attention like this is...

1630
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,458
- Simon, can you shut the fuck up?
- I will not shut up!

1631
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:54,667
This is your mess.

1632
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,500
You created it.

1633
01:48:56,583 --> 01:49:01,167
You invited this Cullen fellow in,
you didn't properly consult me!

1634
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:04,167
What? I didn't properly consult you?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1635
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,518
We had a conversation.

1636
01:49:05,542 --> 01:49:07,982
- Give me his phone number.
- What? Whose phone number?

1637
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,809
This fucking Cullen fuck.
Give me his fucking phone number!

1638
01:49:09,833 --> 01:49:12,143
- I'm not gonna give you his phone number.
- Why the fuck not?

1639
01:49:12,167 --> 01:49:15,583
Because you're acting crazy! You're acting
like a fucking lunatic right now!

1640
01:49:15,667 --> 01:49:17,667
You think this is crazy, huh?

1641
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:20,191
- You think this is me being crazy?
- Peter! Calm down!

1642
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:21,833
You fucking calm down!

1643
01:49:21,917 --> 01:49:23,167
Duckman!

1644
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,000
I'm gonna beat you down
unless you chill out.

1645
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:30,958
Oh, I'd like to see you try, old man.
Fucking come on!

1646
01:49:31,042 --> 01:49:32,917
Settle down, fellas.

1647
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:41,875
I do believe I'm finished.

1648
01:49:45,917 --> 01:49:47,125
So...

1649
01:49:48,917 --> 01:49:50,750
do me a favor, and...

1650
01:49:53,417 --> 01:49:55,500
be lovely to one another.

1651
01:49:57,167 --> 01:49:58,958
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

1652
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:09,333
Dick.

1653
01:51:10,042 --> 01:51:11,042
Glen.

1654
01:51:11,708 --> 01:51:15,458
The president wants to see you in DC.

1655
01:51:15,542 --> 01:51:17,958
You need to be on a plane this afternoon.

1656
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:21,958
- Okay.
- Okay.

1657
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:32,417
Andy.

1658
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:39,958
Badi.

1659
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:47,292
Okay. Let's go, Willy.

1660
01:51:57,333 --> 01:51:58,667
Fall out.

1661
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:35,667
- Do you need anything, boss?
- No. Thank you, Willy.

1662
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:42,792
Are you... are you sure you don't need me
to come with you?

1663
01:52:44,917 --> 01:52:46,333
I'm fine, Willy.

1664
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:49,375
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1665
01:53:17,917 --> 01:53:21,792
<i>And so Glen finally got</i>
<i>his face time with the president.</i>

1666
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:25,583
<i>Getting fired probably wasn't
the kind of face time he was after,</i>

1667
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:27,583
<i>but, well,</i>

1668
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:30,875
<i>I guess you could say it was
kind of a page in the history books.</i>

1669
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:33,375
<i>That was pretty exciting for me.</i>

1670
01:53:34,667 --> 01:53:37,708
<i>But, sadly, while I would've liked
to have thought</i>

1671
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:41,375
<i>that my story had made a difference,
it didn't.</i>

1672
01:53:41,458 --> 01:53:45,125
<i>It just became another
celebrity-fall-from-grace story.</i>

1673
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:48,750
<i>It would've been nice
if the conversation after</i>

1674
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:52,333
<i>had been about the failure
of counterinsurgency,</i>

1675
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:55,875
<i>or why we seem so desperate
to be at war all the time,</i>

1676
01:53:55,958 --> 01:53:59,375
<i>or how maybe what we're doing
is just making more enemies</i>

1677
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:03,042
<i>all in the name of keeping America safe.</i>

1678
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:06,458
<i>It might've been nice if it had caused
someone important to ask</i>

1679
01:54:06,542 --> 01:54:08,542
<i>what any of this says about us.</i>

1680
01:54:09,667 --> 01:54:13,375
<i>But really, the only question
anyone seemed to want to ask was...</i>

1681
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:15,833
<i>What the fuck was Glen McMahon doing</i>

1682
01:54:15,917 --> 01:54:18,375
<i>talking to a Rolling Stone
reporter anyway?</i>

1683
01:54:19,542 --> 01:54:21,917
<i>Which, admittedly, is a good question.</i>

1684
01:54:23,542 --> 01:54:27,083
<i>Anyway, in the absence
of any real soul searching,</i>

1685
01:54:27,167 --> 01:54:28,500
<i>what do we do?</i>

1686
01:54:28,583 --> 01:54:32,833
<i>Well, obviously, we sack Glen
and we bring in some other guy.</i>

1687
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:35,292
<i>And that other guy...</i>

1688
01:54:36,417 --> 01:54:37,958
<i>was Bob.</i>
