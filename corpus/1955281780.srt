(suspenseful orchestral music)

8
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,549

10
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,722
Sign here.

11
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,297
I'm gonna need that scarf girl.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,305
And you're gonna have
to lose those hoops.

13
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,717
Any other piercings
or body jewelry

14
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,186
they can get a hold of?

15
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:31,058
(suspenseful orchestral music)

16
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,889
Mm hm.

17
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,325

00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,943
(inaudible chatter)

23
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,346
Stay behind the yellow line.

24
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:29,783
(inaudible cackles)

25
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,785
(door creaks)

26
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:39,560
(inaudible cackles)

27
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:47,735
Hello baby, do you
like it long and hard?

28
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,102
(laughs maniacally)

29
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,373
I am hot and fresh for you.

30
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,408
(laughs maniacally)

31
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,410
Don't make eye contact.

32
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,946
Get me out of here,
I'm not a whore,

33
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,249
I just needed the dough.

34
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,950
(chuckles)

35
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,254
This way.

36
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,790
Hey man, you want
to get baked man?

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,293
(laughs boisterously)

38
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,263
Hey Mary, how would you
like to get yourself sticky

39
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,730
with a little cream puff?

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,732
(laughs deviously)
(Clarissa gasps)

41
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,669
Damn.

42
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,472
(laughs deviously)

43
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,139
I can smell your muffin!

44
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,676
(Clarissa groans)
(laughs deviously)

45
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,314
(electric buzzes)

46
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,715
Good evening.

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,918
I'm ok.

48
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,854
(suspenseful music)

49
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,356
Good evening.

50
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,091
Mr. Gingerdead Man sir,

51
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,428
my name is Clarissa Darling.

52
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,497
May I have a word with you, sir?

53
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,632
May I see your
credentials please?

54
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,467
Certainly.

55
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:57,004
(suspenseful music)

56
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,572
Closer please.

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,342
Closer.

58
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,378
Still not close enough.

59
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,684
That's a library card.

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,887
Mr. Gingerded Man sir,

61
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,324
I've been sent here by the FBI.

62
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,860
Tell me Clarissa,
when you were running

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,495
down the hall just now,

64
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,566
that little cream puff, he
shouted something at you.

65
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,736
Tell me, what did he say?

66
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,770
He said,

67
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,406
"I can smell your muffin."

68
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,975
(Gingerdead Man inhales sharply)

69
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,345
I, however, can not.

70
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,947
I do however, smell
the faint undertone

71
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,815
of vanilla scented skin cream,

72
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,151
and that pimento loaf sandwich

73
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,020
that you had for
lunch, but not today.

74
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,756
I am putting
together a case study

75
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,058
on just what it is that
drives you to kill sir,

76
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,627
if you are willing to
cooperate in my investigation,

77
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,129
the DA is willing
to cut you a deal.

78
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,403
Candy Land Island.

79
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:05,373
Just off the coast
of Lolipop Bay.

80
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,509
Everyday, for three hours,
you will be permitted

81
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,712
to go outside into
the fresh air.

82
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,614
You will walk on the
brown sugar beach,

83
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:17,250
you will swim in
the lemonade ocean

84
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,754
under (sighs) SWAT team
surveillance of course.

85
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,623
Will I now?

86
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,860
Come, come Clarissa,
let's not play games.

87
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,396
Do you honestly
think they can send

88
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,698
some rookie in here
to try and unlock

89
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,402
the complicated secrets of my
brilliant sophisticated mind?

90
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,769
(farts loudly)

91
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,639
(laughs gleefully)

92
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,274
What are the ingredients
that drive you to kill?

93
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,776
(buzzer buzzes)
Huh?

94
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,144
[Voiceover] Attention
all side chief personnel,

95
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,679
there's been a security breach.

96
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,416
We have been infiltrated by
misguided animal activists.

97
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,952
All personnel are to evacuate
the premises immediately.

98
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,953
(Gingerdead Man gulps)

99
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:53,854
(door clanks)

100
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,623
Oh my God, the horror!

101
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:56,657
What the fuck?

102
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,427
(background clatters)

103
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,729
(laughs evilly)

104
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,031
(chuckles gleefully)

105
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,833
You hippy mother fuckers
can't be up in here.

106
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,436
Yo Ezekiel, release these
imprisoned creations of God.

107
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,637
(club bangs)

108
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,539
Yea, run chipmunk.

109
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,273
Run muskrats!

110
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,443
Sugar gliders be free once again

111
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,545
from the horrors
of intersection.

112
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,746
(glass crashes)

113
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,714
Sweets for the sweet,
hey Gingerdead Man,

114
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,683
there is no FBI case.

115
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,485
You posses the soul
of my homeless brother

116
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,819
and drove him to kill himself.

117
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,455
Now I'm here to even the score

118
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,490
you little half
baked piece of shit.

119
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,524
No!

120
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,291
[Clarissa] No!

121
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,960
(gun fires)

122
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,894
(giggles)

123
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,895
Go be free!

124
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,230
(groans vigorously)

125
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,468
Oh my God!

126
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:41,802
Look what they've done to you,

127
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,737
they've shaved your body

128
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,906
and your little
jelly bean buttons.

129
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,211
Oh they've cut off
your noble (mumbles).

130
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,581
Don't you worry, I'm
gonna get you out of here.

131
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,950
(Gingerdead Man groans)

132
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,555
Be free, be free little
capuchin monkey, be free.

133
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,657
Run, run as fast as you can.

134
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,626
No, you don't understand!

135
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,494
(nose pops)

136
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,328
Fuck you!

137
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,597
I'll kill you...

138
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,831
[Gingerdead Man]
And fuck you too!

139
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:11,632
Do you understand
me Mr. Gingerdead Man?

140
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,866
(screams painfully)

141
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,034
I'll kill you if it's
the last thing I do,

142
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,505
I will track you
until the end of time!

143
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,707
Oh, shit!

144
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:24,612
(screams horrified)

145
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,279
(tiresome gasps)

146
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,280
Gotta haul ass.

147
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,281
Where am I?

148
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,119
Well fuck me to tears,
looks like I'm toast.

149
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,521
There he is!
(gun fires)

150
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,155
[Gingerdead Man]
Mother fucker!

151
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,124
This looks like fun.

152
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,058
(door creaks)

153
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,060
By Joe, I think we've got it!

154
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,729
This sustenance time machine

155
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,564
can actually send
simple food matter

156
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,065
into time and space.

157
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,035
Soon, hunger as we know it
will be eradicated, forever.

158
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,537
Just think of it,

159
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:53,641
a loaf of bread with an
expiration date of 100 years!

160
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,875
(laugh gleefully)

161
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,676
[Gingerdead Man] Too
bad your expiration date

162
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,044
is right fucking now.

163
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,112
(gun shots erupt)

164
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,750
(laughs evilly)

165
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,184
Woo!

166
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,185
Open the door, you
little fucking fruitcake.

167
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,654
I'm gonna knock that ass out.

168
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,221
Hurry up open the
door, I can't wait

169
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,990
'til I'll be able
to bust your ass.

170
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,691
(Gingerdead Man groans)

171
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,959
(door breaks)

172
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,561
Freeze you little
fun sized fucker.

173
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,295
Oh?

174
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,731
Sorry brown sugar, I'm
gonna have to catch you

175
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,667
some other time!

176
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,702
(laughs evilly)

177
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:25,072
(electronic swirls erupt)

178
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:30,077
(Gingerdead Man screams)

179
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:36,383
(upbeat rock music)

180
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,819
* Run, run, run
as fast as you can

181
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,390
* I'm not all mean,
I've devised a plan

182
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,260
* I'm sick, I'm
whack, I'm a maniac

183
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,462
* I'm touched, I'll
slides, I'll bust a cap

184
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,232
* So run, run, run
as fast as you can

185
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,103
* So run

186
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,338
* Just run

187
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,674
* I said run

188
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,343
* I'm a deviant
outcast out for blood

189
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,848
* Knowing the goal,
you're name is mud

190
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,719
* You didn't meet,
you're ass is grass

191
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,987
* I'm opening up
a can of whoop ass

192
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,724
* So run, run, run
as fast as you can

193
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,628
* So run

194
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,830
* Just run

195
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,332
* I said run

196
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,668
* I'm a type O
negative sociopath

197
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,239
* I'll tear your heart,
you'll feel my wrath

198
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,309
* I'll run your bones
'til they run red

199
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,411
* You won't fight back
'cause you'll be dead

200
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,148
* So run, run, run
as fast as you can

201
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,018
* So run

202
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,220
* Just run

203
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,657
* I said run

204
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:52,225
* Run, run, run
as fast as you can

205
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,764
* I'll take you out
with a frying pan

206
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,634
* Well in my way
I'm ready to brawl

207
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,903
* I'm a walking
talking wrecking ball

208
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,706
* So run, run, run
as fast as you can

209
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,509
* So run

210
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,679
* Just run

211
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,147
* I said run

212
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:19,152
* So run

213
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,124
* Yea

214
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,292
* Huh

215
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,168
(funky disco music)

216
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,757
(electronic swooshes erupt)

217
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,958
Huh?

218
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,727
1976?

219
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,495
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

220
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,197
Well, oh, I gotta
get outta here.

221
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,399
(Gingerdead Man
screams frustrated)

222
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,367
What are you do?

223
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,335
(gasps)

224
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,302
Look out, look out!

225
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,805
(chatters painfully)

226
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,811
(inhales sharply)

227
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,113
Oh yea.

228
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,481
(inhales sharply)

229
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,150
Oh yea!

230
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,919
Snowball!

231
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,356
Hey everybody, it's
time to switch it up!

232
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,124
Change partners!

233
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:36,129
(funky disco music)

234
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,635
Looking good PJ!

235
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,237
[Voiceover] Hey classy lady!

236
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,376
Oh yea, taking shit!

237
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,214
Hey, where are you going?

238
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,452
Huh?

239
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,221
Oh, pussy!

240
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:07,660
(funky disco music)

241
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,833
That twirls Epstien,

242
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,835
he's gonna skate in
the Olympics some day.

243
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,036
How do you know that?

244
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,537
Shut up Pickles!

245
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,373
He's waiting to ask Tammy
Pimento to marry him

246
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,175
until he wins a gold medal,

247
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,345
then he's gonna melt
the gold medal down

248
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,814
and make two matching rings,

249
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:28,816
so they can have a
white wedding on wheels.

250
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:31,284
Oh God, I'm gonna puke!

251
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,125
[Little Girl] Oh
shut up Pickles!

252
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,061
Oh, all right,
enough, get away!

253
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,930
Such a freaking fox.

254
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,431
Duh!

255
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,834
I mean, why else do you think
I'd be reigning roller queen

256
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,735
for four years in a row?

257
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,038
Are you ready to bring home
another crown tonight baby?

258
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,305
[Woman] What do you think?

259
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,306
I think...

260
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,309
I'd like to peel off
those satin pants

261
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,411
and ball you in the
back of my Trans AM.

262
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,947
Ugh back off Epstein.

263
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,549
[Epstein] Come on, you
know you're my best girl.

264
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,017
Give me some loving.

265
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,485
Whatever...

266
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,321
you'll get your rocks
off after I get my title.

267
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,023
Tonight, it's my night.

268
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,892
And none of these
little rink rats

269
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,861
are gonna take my
crown away from me.

270
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:14,895
Well then I better make sure

271
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,396
you get what's rightfully yours.

272
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,498
If I do, then...

273
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:20,868
well.

274
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,469
(giggles alluringly)

275
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,771
(upbeat disco music)

276
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,738
Cunt!

277
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,277
Attention skaters!

278
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,348
Welcome to the fourth annual
Roller Boogie Queen Contest

279
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,717
here at Trixie's Roller Land.

280
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,752
(crowd cheers)

281
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,289
Is everybody getting down
and having a good time?

282
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,324
(crowd cheers)

283
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,527
Get out on the rink and
show us it's done Trixie!

284
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,996
(crowd cheers)

285
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,931
Oh children, I
think it's no secret

286
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,500
that my skating days
have come and gone.

287
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,637
And sadly, so have all of yours.

288
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,908
(crowd protests confused)

289
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,642
Coincidentally, on this day

290
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,711
of great roller
boogie celebration,

291
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,648
I have received a telegram
from the county tax commission.

292
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,784
There is a balance of
back property taxes

293
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,254
that is going to result
in me closing the doors

294
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,056
of the roller disco.

295
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,826
Uncle Sam can't kill disco!

296
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,194
(crowd yells agreeably)

297
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,363
We're not gonna
let a few back taxes

298
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,265
shut this place down!

299
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,433
(crowd yells agreeably)

300
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,935
You're right!

301
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:31,704
It would take exactly
$85,000 for that to happen.

302
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,040
Well if we all work together,

303
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,141
maybe we could raise the dough

304
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,308
and pay for it ourselves?

305
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,444
(crowd shouts agreeably)

306
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,946
I know!

307
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,814
Maybe we can hold a roller
disco bikini car wash

308
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,483
in the parking lot tonight!

309
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,085
(crowd cheers)

310
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,087
Oh, that'll help.

311
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,388
Oh, oh, oh, I know!

312
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,623
We could have a roller
boogie bake sale!

313
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,994
(crowd cheers agreeably)

314
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,996
Surrounded by idiots!

315
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,598
Bake sale, here we go again!

316
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,133
Whoa!

317
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,570
Please, while I appreciate
your generous selflessness,

318
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,306
there's nothing I can do.

319
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,441
Let's just turn those
frowns upside down

320
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,310
and keep on trucking!

321
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,814
(crowd cheers)

322
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,183
Little Angel!

323
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,417
Huh?

324
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,586
Get that mirror ball
spinning white hot!

325
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,222
If this is gonna be the
final roller boogie contest,

326
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,391
let's make it the best one ever!

327
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,792
(crowd cheers)

328
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,996
Oh, and one more thing
before the festivities begin.

329
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,597
I'd like to introduce you all,

330
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,666
to my pride and joy,

331
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,003
my lovely niece Cherry.

332
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,370
She's come here
to help me pack up

333
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,306
what's left of my dream.

334
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,175
Please embrace her and
make her feel welcome,

335
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,012
she's all I've got
left in this world.

336
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,247
Say hi Cherry, don't be shy.

337
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,249
Hello.

338
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,385
(crowd greetings erupt)

339
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,421
Isn't she a delight?

340
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,123
Nerd!

341
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,225
(light shatters)

342
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,128
(ominous music)

343
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,233
And don't forget
to cast your votes

344
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,268
for the final
roller boogie queen

345
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:11,838
with our very own rink
manager, Miss Ingrid Harshman.

346
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,941
(crowd cheers)

347
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,277
Now let's roller boogie!

348
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,080
(crowd cheers)

349
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,085
(funky disco music)

350
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,494
(eerie violins snap)

351
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:41,501
(funky disco music)

352
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,572
(laughs boisterously)

353
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,076
(groans frustratedly)

354
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,612
Come on, why isn't this
stupid fucking thing working?

355
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,347
Get me the fuck outta here!

356
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,648
Oh come on!

357
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,417
(whimpers frustratedly)

358
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,785
Dynamite!

359
00:16:58,785 --> 00:16:59,586
Huh?

360
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,787
Asshole!

361
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,859
Of all the shithead
decades to get stranded in.

362
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,865
(funky disco music)

363
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:21,208
DJoreen, Sandy, it's
time for the big car wash!

364
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,742
Oh ok Connie!

365
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,244
We're gonna do what?

366
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,245
(girls squeal)

367
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,746
I'm gonna get you both wet!

368
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:27,880
(girls squeal)

369
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,815
Oh, whoa!

370
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,517
I'm gonna hose some hoes!

371
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,453
(girls squeal gleefully)

372
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,155
(groans pleasurably)

373
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,529
Nice rack!

374
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,164
Well as long as
I'm stranded here,

375
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,399
might as well roll a few heads!

376
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,600
Woo hoo!

377
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,239
Where's the cigarette machine?

378
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,910
Hey Peaches, happy last
night of Boogie Land.

379
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,646
Right back at your Peej!

380
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,349
Oh my God, Tux look!

381
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,550
What?

382
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,285
My mood ring, it says
that something epic

383
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,787
is gonna happen tonight
that I'm never gonna forget.

384
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,490
Duh!

385
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,159
What's that?

386
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,194
I call it Tux's
magical trail mix.

387
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:18,030
Shrooms, loods, acid, ecstasy,
bennies, and nose candy,

388
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,167
if we gotta say
goodbye to Boogie Land,

389
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,169
I say we cannonball
it to the max.

390
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,570
Count me in!

391
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,372
Ok, what should we
start with first?

392
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,275
How about a couple of these?

393
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,412
Let's get it on.

394
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,350
(chuckles)

395
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,653
(laughs playfully)

396
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:45,658
(upbeat disco music)

397
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,496
Randy.

398
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,265
Randy, this is my
precious niece.

399
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,667
She'll be helping us
close the place this week

400
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,637
and I thought maybe you
might show her around.

401
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,439
Sure thing.

402
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,341
Hi, I'm Randy.

403
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,212
She's Cherry, and I'd
like her to stay that way,

404
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,979
so if it's not too much trouble.

405
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,916
Yea, yea no problem.

406
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,685
I was gonna take a
break in a minute

407
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,454
and I was wanting to know

408
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,489
if you wanted to go for
a spin around the rink.

409
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,228
Oh no, Cherry isn't interested
in skating, are you dear?

410
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,662
Oh, she'll leave that to you.

411
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,231
Well, maybe, I think I...

412
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,765
Now, now, you're far too
clumsy for that my dear.

413
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,868
She's got a one way ticket to
becoming a dental hygienist,

414
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:29,869
don't you?

415
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,003
I don't know, I think...

416
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,239
Molars not rollers!

417
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,240
If I could just...

418
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,241
Drills not thrills.

419
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,242
But I just want...

420
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,243
Cavities not depravities.

421
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,444
Ok.

422
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,279
All right then,
that's settled.

423
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,480
I don't think it
would be a problem.

424
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,648
No skating!

425
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,317
(chuckles)

426
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,619
Oh, I will be in
my office packing

427
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,621
if you kids need anything.

428
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,692
Remember...

429
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,263
- No skating.
- [Randy] No skating.

430
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,265
Promise?

431
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,599
Yes Aunt Trixie.

432
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,272
You two have a
wonderful night.

433
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,875
(suspenseful violin notes)

434
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,649
Ah come on, how about just
a quick spin around the rink?

435
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,286
Are you crazy, I couldn't.

436
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,953
You heard her.

437
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,722
Besides, I don't even
know how to skate.

438
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,656
Yeehaw!

439
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,524
There he is!

440
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:25,792
What?

441
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,226
That little man, he
was right over there.

442
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,663
Little man?

443
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,098
Yes, he was
running right over...

444
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,837
There couldn't possibly
be a little man

445
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,339
running around in
here could there?

446
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,073
Maybe I'm...

447
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,675
a little more jet
lagged than I thought.

448
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,012
I know what it is.

449
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,314
You do?

450
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,581
Yea, you just need to
blow off a little steam.

451
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,982
Here come on, I'll
show you, it's easy.

452
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,551
I'd better not.

453
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,087
Look how crowded
the dance floor is.

454
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,191
She'll never even see you.

455
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,860
Really?

456
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,798
(funky disco music)

457
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,801
Come with me.

458
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:15,174
(funky disco music)

459
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,721
Oh stop Sandy, you're
getting me all wet!

460
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,392
You know you
love it foxy lady!

461
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,695
(girls squeal)

462
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,400
Washing cars is fun!

463
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,435
Oh yea!

464
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,136
Oh let's do this.

465
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,139
(girls squealing delighfully)

466
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,076
(groans satisfactorily)

467
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,684
And after that, I'm
gonna buy 10 pet rocks

468
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,386
and Shetland pony named Bear,

469
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,954
then I'm gonna marry
a Bay City Roller.

470
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,756
Those guys are fags.

471
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,494
You ever say that
again, you can forget

472
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,762
watching me compete in the
battle of the network stars

473
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,631
when I'm a famous actress.

474
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,566
Ok, I'm sorry.

475
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,638
Can I ask you a question?

476
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,106
What?

477
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,974
Do you ever think we're
gonna be able to skate

478
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,176
without this stupid railing.

479
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,545
Of course we will.

480
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,213
A digital calculator?

481
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,816
We've been coming
here all summer.

482
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,151
Seems like we would've
learned something by now.

483
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,787
Be patient Pickles,
we're not gonna become

484
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,723
championship skaters over night.

485
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,425
We'll make our mark.

486
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,661
Everybody gets their turn
underneath the disco ball.

487
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:45,932
(electronic pulses swoosh)

488
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:50,437
(kids scream)

489
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:58,578
(upbeat disco music)

490
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,081
(Gingerdead Man chuckles)

491
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,216
Wrong exit baby!

492
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,652
You're soaking it in.

493
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:09,789
Huh?

494
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,793
Danger, hydro...

495
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,695
hydrochloric acid?

496
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:18,465
You bitches look so
hot, I almost can't do

497
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,299
what I know I'm about to do.

498
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,236
(laughs evilly)

499
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,508
Almost!

500
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:33,480
(upbeat disco music)

501
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,285
Here come with me.

502
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,121
I can't, we shouldn't
be doing this.

503
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,556
Take my hand.

504
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,692
You can do this, all right,
you should be dancing.

505
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,159
But my aunt!

506
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,965
Take a chance on me.

507
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:58,838
(funky disco music)

508
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,122
Oh my God, Tammy you
look so beautiful tonight.

509
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,525
I've never seen
anybody skate like you.

510
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,092
Fuck off lady.

511
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:25,031
(funky disco music)

512
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,927
(all cheer)

513
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,734
(jazzy disco music)

514
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,636
(girls squeal delightfully)

515
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:04,771
That's it!

516
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,840
(girls giggle)

517
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,609
(ominous music)

518
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,278
(Gingerdead Man
giggles maniacally)

519
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,883
(girls squeal delightfully)

520
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,319
How much money have we raised?

521
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,954
Oh let me check.

522
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,395
$2!

523
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,362
What?

524
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,599
How many cars have we washed?

525
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,432
One!

526
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,067
Yea and it's Trixie's!

527
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:39,005
(girls laugh gleefully)

528
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,476
Some hose for the hoes.

529
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,913
(laughs maniacally)

530
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,351
That's it, let it wash over you.

531
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,922
(girls squeal delightfully)

532
00:25:55,922 --> 00:26:00,026
(ominous music)

533
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,297
(Gingerdead Man cackles evilly)

534
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:14,373
(girls scream painfully)

535
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:18,811
Great job!

536
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,012
Did I ok?

537
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,213
Heck yea, you're
a super freak.

538
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,782
Thanks.

539
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,516
I'm gonna grab us a
couple cold Shastas.

540
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,517
Ok.

541
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,821
[Voiceover] Woo, woo!

542
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,423
Way to go!

543
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,559
Yea, talk about
your fast learners.

544
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,493
Thanks.

545
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,161
I'm Coco.

546
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,162
And I'm Yoko.

547
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,196
I'm Cherry.

548
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,098
You've got the moves woman.

549
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,668
Yea, and it looks like
Randy's got his eye on you.

550
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:42,669
Me?

551
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,037
Oh no, someone as perfect as him

552
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,239
would never go for
someone as plain as me.

553
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,474
Are you kidding?

554
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,376
He's dated some real
pigs in his time.

555
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,712
Um hm, you're
exactly his type.

556
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:55,481
All you need is a little
disco dust to fix you up.

557
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,749
What do you mean?

558
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,585
[Both] A roller
boogie makeover!

559
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,187
Come on!

560
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,454
When we're done with
you, you'll be crowned

561
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,990
the last Roller Boogie Queen.

562
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,757
Really?

563
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,692
Uh huh.

564
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:06,826
Maybe it's true what they say

565
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,427
about saving the best for last.

566
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:11,097
'Bout time we got some
new blood around here.

567
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,364
(Cherry giggles)

568
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,004
If it's new blood you want,

569
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,172
well then it's new
blood you'll get.

570
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:24,410
(girls scream painfully)

571
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,846
(Gingerdead Man laughs evilly)

572
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,717
(girls scream painfully)

573
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,958
(skin sizzles)

574
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:45,297
Ah, the smell of
womanhood and melting flesh.

575
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:49,135
(girls squeal gleefully)

576
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:53,806
(upbeat disco music)

577
00:27:58,745 --> 00:27:59,746
* Uh huh

578
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:01,914
* Uh huh

579
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,016
* Uh huh

580
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,387
* Uh huh

581
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,622
* Uh huh

582
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:12,925
* Uh huh

583
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,094
* Uh huh

584
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:20,332
(girls squeal joyfully)

585
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,205
You look like a
roller disco diva girl!

586
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,307
Yea, now let's go out
there and get you that crown!

587
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,010
But my aunt...

588
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,244
We'll surprise her
with the new you.

589
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:35,014
Now, go ahead, turn around.

590
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,685
(girls scream excitedly)

591
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,087
I'm a stone cold fox!

592
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,621
(girls scream joyfully)

593
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,622
(static buzzes)

594
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:44,791
[Yoko] What happened?

595
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,225
That was weird.

596
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,360
Hey, you guys are right,
let's get outta here

597
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,561
and go skate.

598
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,830
Ok.

599
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,031
(ominous music)

600
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,966
(Gingerdead Man
laughs victoriously)

601
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,434
Crack myself up.

602
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,806
Well better get outta here
before the fuzz gets here.

603
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,477
(groans with struggle)

604
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,479
Wee!

605
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:12,251
(trippy rock music)

606
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:16,622
Oh my God, the
colors are so colorful.

607
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,559
I'm tripping my
brains out Peaches.

608
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,294
Make love to me now.

609
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,329
Ok.

610
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,198
Maybe we shouldn't

611
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:29,836
all the melting water
color ballerinas

612
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:34,040
and flying aquatic
creatures might see us.

613
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,441
(chuckle impaired)

614
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,278
Sh, Peaches.

615
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,848
I think this demon
has risen from Hell

616
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:43,749
and it's headed
right towards us.

617
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,188
Let's go hide in that
magical cave over there.

618
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,858
Yes, quick!

619
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,626
We gotta turn invisible first.

620
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,661
Ok.

621
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,064
Come on.

622
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:08,040
Oh, oh yea!

623
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,976
Coming to cop a
squat honey buns?

624
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,811
Who's there?

625
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,713
Oh, come on, don't be shy,

626
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,416
bend over and show
me that big fat ass.

627
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,918
Where are you?

628
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,452
Take off your underpants
and strut around for me.

629
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:25,457
Oh, oh yea, pussy.

630
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,259
I see you.

631
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,827
(Gingerdead Man groans)

632
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,562
you peeping Tom.

633
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,900
That's it, come
a little closer,

634
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,468
I got a snack cake for ya'.

635
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:40,940
Oh, well, well, well,
what have we here.

636
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,341
Why don't you come on over here

637
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,442
and nibble on it for me.

638
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,443
(woman growls)

639
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,445
(Gingerdead Man screams)

640
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,680
Let go of me you fucking cunt!

641
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,116
[Woman] Come on,
you son of a...

642
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,318
(cookie snaps)

643
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,852
(screams painfully)

644
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,857
(celebratory orchestral music)

645
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:21,080
(upbeat disco music)

646
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,025
You look beautiful.

647
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,193
So do you.

648
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,795
Skate with me?

649
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:37,796
Uh huh.

650
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,771
Mm, I'm voting for her.

651
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,974
Yea, I'm picking that cherry.

652
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:51,410
Whoa, she cleans up real good.

653
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,979
Ow!

654
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:57,883
(slow jam music)

655
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,420
That little whore.

656
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,359
(faint taps)

657
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,727
(mic screeches)

658
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,063
Attention everyone.

659
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,632
I can't tell you how
it warms my heart

660
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,902
to so clearly see
you all down there

661
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,472
skating and having a good time,

662
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,809
even though some of you
made a distinct promise

663
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,279
that you would not.

664
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,049
And don't forget, you still
have five more minutes

665
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,951
to vote for the final
Roller Boogie Queen.

666
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:10,956
(papers rustle)

667
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,695
(playful music)

668
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,864
(toilet flushes)

669
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,307
Woo, Christ!

670
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,876
What's that broad
living on, sawdust?

671
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,478
(groans)

672
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,946
I'm so busted.

673
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,117
I wanna thank you all
from the bottom of my heart

674
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:42,421
for giving this old
broad a wonderful life

675
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:47,093
and I can't wait to see
what's in store for all of you

676
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:50,896
once the music finally ends.

677
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,534
Cherry Wright to the
management office please.

678
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,338
Cherry Wright to the
management office.

679
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,439
She saw me!

680
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,108
You're all right.

681
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:06,978
(tense music)

682
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:14,920
(trippy rock music)

683
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,132
The walls are throbbing.

684
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,468
So am I butterfly.

685
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:38,610
(moans pleasurably)

686
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,781
(trippy rock music)

687
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:08,039
(ominous music)

688
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,208
[Gingerdead Man] Huh?

689
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,312
Oh!

690
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,548
(cackles ominously)
(suspenseful music)

691
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,628
(grunts with struggle)

692
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,962
Oh fuck.

693
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:38,537
Nice view!

694
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:48,013
(laughs evilly)

695
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,115
Woo hoo!

696
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:55,120
(upbeat disco music)

697
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:03,061
* I'm gonna disco you to death

698
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,332
* Kiss you at the moment

699
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,733
(knocks at door)

700
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,370
Yes?

701
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,005
You wanted to see me?

702
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,609
My, my, my don't
we look festive.

703
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,446
The roller girls
gave me a makeover.

704
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:23,114
Well, aren't they
the lucky ones.

705
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,050
Sit.

706
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,261
(grunts pleasurably)

707
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:39,064
It's synergy baby, come
on hammer me, hammer me, oh!

708
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:44,770
(grunts pleasurably)

709
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,374
What the hell are
you two doing in here?

710
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,009
Hi.

711
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,313
Yea, real high.

712
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:59,285
(trippy rock music)

713
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,854
You're sexy.

714
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,591
Yea.

715
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,958
What's up stud?

716
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:11,297
Looks like you two
could use some company.

717
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:13,932
Yea, come join us.

718
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:21,673
(groans pleasurably)

719
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,843
Oh yea, take it!

720
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,647
Oh God, and I
thought I was vile.

721
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:31,783
So, you think you can defy me

722
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,753
by painting yourself up
like a shameless trollop

723
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,189
and going out there and
making me look like a fool.

724
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,791
I'm not a trollop Aunt Trixie,

725
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,727
I was just skating.

726
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,762
Just skating?

727
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,464
Just skating?

728
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,334
Need I remind you that
you're sitting there

729
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:50,402
talking to a woman whose pelvis

730
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,339
is held together with
a screw and duct tape

731
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,741
because she was just skating.

732
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,409
You're a hypocrite!

733
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,744
If you hate skating so much,

734
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,245
then why do you own
a roller boogie?

735
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,649
Why you little bitch!

736
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,050
(Cheery yelps)

737
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,586
(women grunt)

738
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,855
Listen to me, they're
all gonna laugh at you.

739
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,790
They're all gonna laugh at you.

740
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:13,759
(Cheery yelps)

741
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:17,663
(women grunt)

742
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,365
(groans pleasurably)

743
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,533
Oh boy, if I had a
cock, I'd join in on that.

744
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:30,842
Oh yea, yea.

745
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,378
Looks like everybody around here

746
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:33,845
is looking to get nailed.

747
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,415
(groans pleasurably)

748
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:39,050
I think I can acomodate
them with that.

749
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,553
Yea that's it boys, hammer me!

750
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,055
Hammer me!

751
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,957
Your wish is my command!

752
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,125
Huh?

753
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,996
(nail gun fire erupts)
(laughs evilly)

754
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,631
Bye bye!

755
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:57,403
(laughs evilly)

756
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,417
If you build it, they will come!

757
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:15,787
Oh baby, I'm so high,
I can't feel my arm.

758
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:18,690
Feels so good.

759
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,426
[Gingerdead Man] Suck on this!

760
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:22,193
(laughs evilly)

761
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,262
(women groan with struggle)

762
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,196
[Cherry] You bitch!

763
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,038
(yelps out painfully)

764
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:39,110
Why do you hate skating so much?

765
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,078
What?

766
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,751
(harp music)

767
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,686
It was 1941.

768
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:51,122
FDR was in office and the
Japs were on a rampage

769
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,058
through out the Pacific.

770
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,860
While our boys had
gone off to war

771
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,327
to fight the good fight,

772
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,531
we girls stayed home
and did our best.

773
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,199
I'd been skating since I was kid

774
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,335
and I found myself more
comfortable on wheels

775
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,772
than I was on my own two feet.

776
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,574
It was about that time
the circus came to town,

777
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:12,978
and I found myself barrel
jumping to make ends meat

778
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,646
I was an instant senstation.

779
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,282
Before I knew it I
landed in the USO

780
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,150
performing for the troops.

781
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,120
The boys loved me,
especially FDR himself,

782
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,557
who invited me to a
special sunrise performance

783
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:28,460
in Oahu, Hawaii.

784
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,028
Everything was in place.

785
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,931
It was standing room only.

786
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,533
The sun began to rise behind me

787
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,201
as I took my position.

788
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,137
The crowd went berserk,
they were chanting my name

789
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,640
over and over as I
took a running start

790
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,142
and launched myself in the air.

791
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,410
(planes buzz)

792
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,714
It was about that time
the first bomb hit.

793
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,149
The barrels scattered
as hurled myself

794
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,684
across the marble patio.

795
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,287
And as I laid there
looking up all I could see

796
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,724
were the Japanese
zeros flying overhead.

797
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,294
I hit the ground like
a bag of wet cement,

798
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,297
shattering my pelvis
along with the dream

799
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,600
of a mighty nation.

800
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,301
(harps play)

801
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,271
What are you saying?

802
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,407
I'm saying that had I not
been performing that morning,

803
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:21,412
December 7, 1941, every
last one of those sailors

804
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,115
would've been manning
their battle stations

805
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:28,053
and Pearl Harbor never
would have happened.

806
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,592
So you see, that's why
you can't skate Cherry.

807
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,861
Not now.

808
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,363
Not ever.

809
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,133
I'm sorry about
your past Aunt Trixie,

810
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:45,704
I really am, but I
found my calling.

811
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,640
Your calling?

812
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,380
In four hours those doors
are gonna close forever.

813
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,583
I think we both know
what your calling is.

814
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,686
Wait!

815
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,789
Don't go.

816
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:04,990
Stay!

817
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,058
We'll burn that dress
and pray together.

818
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,394
I'm skating in that roller
boogie contest Aunt Trixie.

819
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,830
I'm skating, and
you can't stop me.

820
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:13,699
Cherry!

821
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,904
And I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.

822
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,606
(ominous music)

823
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:21,840
(electricity crackles)

824
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,745
No problem.

825
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,015
(crowd chants)

826
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,117
Do a little dance,
make alotta love,

827
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,485
commit homicide tonight.

828
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,386
[All] Harshman!

829
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,354
Harshman!

830
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,422
Harshman!

831
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,624
Harshman!

832
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,691

833
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:40,826

834
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:41,960

835
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,028

836
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,195
Harshman!

837
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,263
Harshman!

838
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:46,464
Harshman!

839
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:47,799
Attention skaters.

840
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,000
[All] Harshman!

841
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,503
It's time to
announce the nominees

842
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:57,508
for this year's Roller
Boogie Queen Contest of 1976.

843
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:01,012
(crowd cheers)

844
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,380
Is it you Harshman?

845
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,983
(crowd laughs)

846
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:06,451
Who said that?

847
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:11,489
I'll deal with you
later buster brown.

848
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,961
Where the hell is my remote?

849
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,863
(groans frustrated)

850
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:28,674
(intriguing suspenseful music)

851
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,187
What?

852
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:48,159
(suspenseful music)

853
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,717
Pop goes the weasel!

854
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:12,583
(screams frightened)

855
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,584
(laughs evilly)

856
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,022
(tense suspenseful music)

857
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:18,924
(screams)

858
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:20,191
Cherry!

859
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,127
You'd better get out
on the dance floor,

860
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:23,461
you never know.

861
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,505
(funky disco music)

862
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,208
I'd like to ask the
lovey young nominees

863
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,746
to please skate to the
stage to receive the honor,

864
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:45,083
and also to accept
the complimentary
roller boogie sash,

865
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,753
courtesy of
Joerski's fine meats.

866
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,421
Do I look all right?

867
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,423
Yea, you're one how twat babe.

868
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,560
Our first nominee...

869
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:59,064
is Miss Anne Morganstern.

870
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:01,566
(crowd whoops)

871
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,034
What?

872
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,104
(crowd cheers)

873
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,176
If you could step right.

Our next nominee, Miss
Betty Sue Richards!

875
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,182

00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,191
it's styling, step back.

880
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:30,128
I don't think anyone's going
to be surprised at all,

881
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,197
on the nomination
of this candidate.

882
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:35,233
She's a real classy

00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,535
a dazzling crowd favorite,

884

00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,827
What?

891
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:06,832
(celebratory music)
(crowd cheers)

892
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,034
Whoa!

894
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,376
Hi!

896
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:22,647
Hi!

897
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,088
Oh shit.

898
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:37,062
Oh and four time
winner Tammy Pimento.

899
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:40,198
(audience grumbles)

900
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:44,135
(giggles) Go Tammy,
go Tammy, go Tammy!

901
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,438
[Voiceover] You selfish bitch!

902
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:52,310
Oh gosh, I told myself
I wasn't gonna cry.

903
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,544
(giggles)

904
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,314
First, I would like to
thank my Lord and savior

905
00:46:56,314 --> 00:47:00,018
and I wanna let you all know,
it doesn't matter if I win,

906
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:02,553
it's an honor just
to be nominated.

907
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,955
Put a sock in it Pimento.

908
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:05,924
I will never
forget this night.

909
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,658
Beat it.

910
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,660
Oh yea, that's right.

911
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,096
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to present

00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:48,533
Congratulations!

00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:53,238
(playful suspenseful music)

917
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:55,706
Go over there and see
who's gonna win that contest.

918
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,211
How am I supposed to do that?

919
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,281
I don't care what you
have to do, just do it!

920
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,017
Congratulations!

921
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,285
Thanks!

922
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:08,719
Hey can I talk to
you for a second?

923
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,854
Yea, sure.

924
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,792
I know you don't
know me very well,

925
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,827
do I seem weird to you?

926
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:18,964
No, why?

927
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,233
I'm right.

928
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,970
I am seeing something
running around this place.

929
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,137
Like what?

930
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:28,039
(sighs)

931
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,874
This is gonna
sound really stupid.

932
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,577
It's a gingerbread man.

933
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,079
(laughs skeptically)

934
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,580
A gingerbread man?

935
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:43,354
(Gingerdead Man
laughs maniacally)

936
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:47,858
Oh! Time for more fun!

937
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:52,330
Oh, oh!

938
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:55,233
[Cherry] He was right there.

939
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,168
He?

940
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,569
It was.

941
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,771
It leaped out at me from
behind those boxes right there.

942
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,373
A gingerbread man?

943
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,109
I believe something
jumped out at you,

944
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,743
I mean maybe it was
a rat or something.

945
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,014
Or maybe somebody drugged you?

946
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:11,816
Or not?

947
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,218
Ok.

948
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:16,021
How about we both just
keep our eyes open?

949
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:22,860
(suspenseful music)

950
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,165
(laughs maniacally)

951
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:31,036
Well that was
certainly no surprise.

952
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:32,070
Oh!

953
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,475
It's all very exciting.

954
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:44,715
Uhm, would you excuse
me for a moment?

955
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,484
Well certainly my dear.

956
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:53,058
(upbeat disco music)

957
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:21,519
(playful mysterious music)

958
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,458
She's gonna win.

959
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:28,793
What?

960
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,662
By a landslide.

961
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:35,366
That's not possible.

962
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,537
Oh it's possible babe.

963
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,573
See you only got three votes,

964
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:46,544
so counting you,
me, that means PJ's

965
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,313
the only other one
that voted for you.

966
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,249
Son of a bitch!

967
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,521
That's it.

968
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,055
Go get a phone book.

969
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,691
Why?

970
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,860
(giggles eagerly)

971
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,862
'Cause we need
to find ourselves

972
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,664
an all night pig farm.

973
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,600
Huh?

974
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,438
Oh!

975
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,373
(laughs nervously)

976
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:22,213
(suspenseful music)

977
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,814
(man screams painfully)

978
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,151
(blood squirts)
(suspenseful music)

979
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:28,018
(laughs maniacally)

980
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,387
[Voiceover] Oh my God!

981
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:38,696
(upbeat disco music)

982
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:54,879
Hello world, I've arrived!

983
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,414
This is amazing!

984
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:06,324
(man screams painfully)

985
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:09,960
Help me, somebody
help me please!

986
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,531
(screams painfully)

987
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:21,272
(upbeat disco music)

988
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:30,515
Girl, he is so into you.

989
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:32,917
This night has really
been a dream come true.

990
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:38,823
Uh oh, here comes
your worst nightmare.

991
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,026
Hey there!

992
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:45,630
Oh my God Yoko, work it girl!

993
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,598
And Coco, you look...

994
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:50,000
Just like a Newbian princess

995
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,236
Tammy Pimento!

996
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:52,470
I'm Cherry.

997
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,339
Of course you are!

998
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:58,643
I love your hair, you
look fabulous tonight.

999
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,278
It's amazing how
popular she's become

1000
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:02,247
since she's changed her
looks and personality.

1001
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,948
Yea, she's really arrived.

1002
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,384
You're such a great skater.

1003
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,319
Your aunt must be
so proud of you.

1004
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,155
It's just too bad
you didn't get here

1005
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,123
'til the very last night.

1006
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,259
Thanks.

1007
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:15,626
May the best girl win.

1008
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:16,661
Good luck.

1009
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:22,633
Good luck, you're
gonna need it, nerd.

1010
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,138
Where are you going?

1011
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:32,410
Ah, my work is done here!

1012
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,878
(laughs evilly)

1013
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,347
Wouldn't want the
party to end too soon.

1014
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:42,820
Time for a little
disco genocide!

1015
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,657
(upbeat disco music)

1016
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:47,992
Hey jive turkery!

1017
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:50,828
It's time to crack the whip!

1018
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:55,700
(funky disco music)

1019
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,868
Better yet, let's
crack some skulls!

1020
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,638
There you are.

1021
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,206
I wanted to introduce you
to a couple friends of mine,

1022
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:05,776
Tux and Peaches but I can't
seem to find them anywhere.

1023
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:07,578
Randy!

1024
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,348
Have you seen Connie,
Sandy, or Doreen?

1025
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,216
No?

1026
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:13,183
Hm?

1027
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,686
This is weird.

1028
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,322
Where is everybody?

1029
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:25,830
(slow somber music)

1030
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,765
What are you doing?

1031
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,334
I can't do this.

1032
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,868
They're all gonna laugh at me.

1033
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,236
What are you talking about?

1034
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,605
You're all gonna laugh at me.

1035
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,774
This is a big joke on
the new girl isn't it?

1036
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,008
Joke?

1037
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,143
You're one of the best
skaters I've ever seen,

1038
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:40,144
you're a natural.

1039
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,846
I'm a freak!

1040
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:43,581
There's magic spinning
from those wheels Cherry.

1041
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:45,616
Randy, there's something
you need to know about me.

1042
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:47,685
I'm different.

1043
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:50,555
Yea, you are,

1044
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,591
but you got it going on.

1045
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,493
I've got nothing but an
aunt with a swollen eye

1046
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:57,127
and a broken heart.

1047
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,095
No.

1048
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:02,667
What you have my
dear, is a gift.

1049
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:07,672
(inspirational music)

1050
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:12,843
(funky disco music)

1051
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:13,978
Oh!

1052
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,946
(laughs evilly)

1053
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,548
Can I get a woo woo!

1054
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:18,949
[All] Woo woo!

1055
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,886
(inhales sharply)

1056
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:24,689
Woo woo!

1057
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:26,056
[All] Woo woo!

1058
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,525
Woo woo!

1059
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:28,659
[All] Woo woo!

1060
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,227
Yea come on jive turkey...

1061
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:33,197

1062
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:34,399
[All] Woo woo!

1063
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,668
Woo woo!

1064
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,470
[Gingerdead Man] Oh,

1065
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,777
(inhales sharply)

1066
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:51,782
(suspenseful music)

1067
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:57,287
Wait for melt baby!

1068
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:02,292
(suspenseful music)

1069
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:16,240
(crowd protests)

1070
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,842
(funky disco music)

1071
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:20,277
Uh huh, uh huh.

1072
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:21,345
Woo woo!

1073
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:22,179
(laughs evilly)

1074
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,313
(laughs) Woo!

1075
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:27,051
(laughs joyfully)

1076
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,322
Welcome to Saturday
night clever!

1077
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,827
(funky disco music)

1078
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,564
Man, Little Angel's really
tearing it up tonight.

1079
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:42,467
She's like a rabid dog when
she gets in that DJ booth.

1080
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:45,870
Cherry no.

1081
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,641
I'm sorry I let you down
Aunt Trixie, you were right.

1082
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:54,545
Oh no my dear, I let me down.

1083
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,481
I let us all down.

1084
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:00,117
Oh let's face it, I'm
a bitter old lush.

1085
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:03,721
If I hadn't spent all
those drunken nights

1086
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:07,191
up at the Indian casino, I
would still have the money

1087
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:11,529
to pay the back taxes and this
place wouldn't be closing.

1088
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:14,499
More importantly,
you'd have a place

1089
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:16,601
to roller boogie forever.

1090
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,035
Roller boogie?

1091
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:18,936
But I thought...

1092
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:19,837
Don't speak.

1093
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:21,405
Forget what I said.

1094
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,142
I was wrong Cherry,
you were right.

1095
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:27,778
I've been a hypocrite.

1096
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,613
But...

1097
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,347
No buts.

1098
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,849
When I saw you out there,

1099
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:34,519
I couldn't help but see
a magical reflection

1100
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:36,821
of my former self.

1101
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:40,825
It was as if I was
looking into a mirror,

1102
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,794
well that is before
the shattered hip

1103
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,830
and the bankruptcy issues.

1104
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,532
Excuse me boss,
I have something...

1105
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:48,398
Not now Ingrid.

1106
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:49,834
But it's really important.

1107
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,836
I said give me a second
you horrible woman.

1108
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,738
I want you to put
those skates back on

1109
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:56,574
and get out there
and win that crown,

1110
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:58,408
not for me...

1111
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,744
not for you...

1112
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:06,350
do it for those brave boys
at the bottom of the bay.

1113
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,820
Thank you Aunt Trixie.

1114
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,356
Now get out there
and roller boogie.

1115
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:16,661
(inspiration orchestral music)

1116
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,728
Miss Wright, I...

1117
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,029
Yes Ingrid!

1118
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:20,230
What is it?

1119
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,566
What could possibly
be so important?

1120
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:23,300
You have my undivided
attention, what is it?

1121
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,169
I'm sorry to interrupt chief,

1122
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,205
but it appears been
a triple homicide

1123
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,608
in the janitor's sanctuary.

1124
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:35,580
(suspenseful music)

1125
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:47,758
(chuckles evilly)

1126
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,963
Huh?

1127
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,932
What's that queen up to?

1128
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:59,604
(suspenseful music)

1129
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,105
A wise guy!

1130
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,308
(gasps horrified)

1131
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:05,610
Oh my God!

1132
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:08,913
Good God Ingrid!

1133
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:13,217
What kind of monster could
commit such a massacre?

1134
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,652
It appears they were murdered

1135
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:15,986
while participating
in some sort of

1136
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:18,923
a multi generational
menage trois.

1137
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:20,958
Yes I can see that.

1138
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:25,630
My God, would you look
at what's left of Buzzby?

1139
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:31,135
Sweet Jesus, he was
hung like a Clydesdale.

1140
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:34,972
Never mind, we must alert
the authorities immediately.

1141
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:36,306
Yes!

1142
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,808
And we will!

1143
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:40,645
Just as soon as we crown the
final Roller Boogie Queen.

1144
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:42,980
This night means the
world to my Cherry

1145
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,750
and let's face it, they're
not going anywhere.

1146
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,984
Yea, but boss...

1147
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,485
No buts.

1148
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,087
We will call for a
squad car the moment

1149
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,421
the winner is announced.

1150
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,257
Yes chief.

1151
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,759
In the meantime,
you lock his place up

1152
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:56,060
as tight as a drum.

1153
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,830
And whatever you
do, act natural.

1154
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,434
(sighs defeated)

1155
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:14,779
(upbeat disco music)

1156
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,118
All done!

1157
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,386
Good boy.

1158
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:25,522
Tonight, we're gonna
paint this town red.

1159
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:26,957
With blood!

1160
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,793
(laugh evilly)

1161
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:41,471
(laughs evilly)

1162
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,273
Be careful now!

1163
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,010
Attention everyone!

1164
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,277
The time has come
for the crowning

1165
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:50,114
of our final Roller
Boogie Queen.

1166
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:53,918
Will the nominees please step
up to the stage and join us.

1167
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:59,757
I must say that this moment
is very bittersweet for me.

1168
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,594
I hope you get it.

1169
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,796
Thanks.

1170
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,734
Wait (mumbles)...

1171
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:11,635
Well, there they are skaters!

1172
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:15,439
Please give it up for
our court of 1976!

1173
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:19,509
(crowd cheers)
(celebratory regal music)

1174
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,918
Aren't they lovely?

1175
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,486
Thank you Ingrid.

1176
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:32,957
It's such a special
night for me.

1177
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:35,225
No matter the outcome,
to go out knowing

1178
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:37,995
that my sweet Cherry
has made her way

1179
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:41,298
into the winners circle
does my old heart good.

1180
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,468
(giddily squeals)

1181
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,570
And now the results!

1182
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,973
(cheers erupt)

1183
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:52,342
Not only will the winner
tonight be crowned

1184
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:56,346
by our very own lady of the
court, Miss Ingrid Harshman,

1185
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:59,283
but she will be
awarded with a special

1186
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:03,253
fabulous gift package
containing cash and prizes

1187
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:07,691
including a Mr. Microphone,
Ron Co's pocket fisherman,

1188
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,861

01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:14,698
and a pair of delightful
rainbow toe socks.

1190
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,700
Drum roll please.

1191
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,971
(drums roll)

1192
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:25,976
And the winner is...

1193
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:29,880
Cherry Wright!

1194
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,883
(cheers erupt)

1195
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:37,654
(uplifting inspirational music)

1196
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:42,659
(crowd cheers eagerly)

1197
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:57,908
(suspenseful music)

1198
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:01,846
(uplifting inspirational music)

1199
01:03:01,846 --> 01:03:06,851

(suspenseful music)
(crowd cheers)

1203
01:04:07,912 --> 01:04:10,948
What are you doing?

1204
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:12,449
[Randy] Did you
see what's going on?

1205
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,918
No I don't see anything
except you causing trouble,

1206
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:15,920
now get the hell outta here.

1207
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,356
(suspenseful music)

1208
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,357
(rope snaps)

1209
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,358
Whoa!

1210
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,126
(liquid splatters)

1211
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:23,693
(crowd gasps)

1212
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:28,966
Yea!

1213
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,000
(laugh gleefuly)

1214
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,135
Geronimo!

1215
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:33,337
(crowd screams)

1216
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,605
(Cherry screams)

1217
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:39,076
(laughs evilly)

1218
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,645
Babe!

1219
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:42,746
(knife squishes)

1220
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:47,184
(laughs maniacally)

1221
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:48,986
Night, night!

1222
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:51,521
(gun shots erupt)

1223
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:54,458
Congratulations Cherry,
it's all for you!

1224
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,593
From the bowels
of hell itself.

1225
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:59,196
It's a homicidal
confectionery treat!

1226
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,664
Everybody run!

1227
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,499
(gunfire erupts)

1228
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:04,969
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

1229
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,304
Eat me!

1230
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:09,239
I'm Gingerdead Man
at your service

1231
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,975
my bicentennial bitch!

1232
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:12,676
I hope all you mother
fuckers are hungry,

1233
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:14,544
'cause it's time
for you to eat lead!

1234
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:15,212
Oh my!

1235
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:16,046
(gunshots erupt)

1236
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:16,780
(screams fearfully)

1237
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,714
(gunshots erupt)

1238
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:20,784
(panics fearfully)

1239
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:21,851
[Cherry] What do we do?

1240
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,153
You know what to do.

1241
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,889
You've always known what to do.

1242
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:29,893
You have gifts that
go far beyond the
roller boogie, Cherry.

1243
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:34,331
Use them now, use them as if
your life depends upon it!

1244
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,400
As if it does?

1245
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,301
(gunshot erupts)

1246
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,536
Son of a bitch!

1247
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:43,607
Now Cherry, kill that bastard!

1248
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,409
(suspenseful music)

1249
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:47,011
Sleep tight you little cunt!

1250
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:52,016
(doors slam)

1251
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,052
(suspenseful music)

1252
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,120
[Voiceover] There's magic
spinning from the wheels Cherry.

1253
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,023
Bring it on crazy eyes!

1254
01:05:59,023 --> 01:06:00,490
Thank you!

1255
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,361
You know, I always hated
Tammy, she was such a bitch.

1256
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:07,897
I totally voted
for you, I swear.

1257
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,833
(gunshot erupts)

1258
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:13,137
Put a cork in it you whore!

1259
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:16,573
Step right up, who's
ready for some more sugar?

1260
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:20,410
Do something Cherry!

1261
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:25,415
(suspenseful music)

1262
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,687
Let's boogie down!

1263
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,489
(electric explodes)

1264
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:34,958
Fuck!

1265
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,795
(electric static crackles)

1266
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:42,832
(suspenseful music)

1267
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,401
Pretty pity!

1268
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,503
(laughs evilly)

1269
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:50,074
(electric crackles)

1270
01:06:57,981 --> 01:06:59,916
Disco inferno!

1271
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,287
(laughs evilly)

1272
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:05,989
How do I look?

1273
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,191
So cute.

1274
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:09,626
Oh my God, what color
lipstick is that?

1275
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,628
It's shocking pink.

1276
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:12,596
[Voiceover] Can I try it?

1277
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:13,530
Oh yea, totally.

1278
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,533
(electric current buzzes)

1279
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,102
Don't act so shocked!

1280
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:20,104
(laughs maniacally)

1281
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:21,705
Don't act so shocked, get it?

1282
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,175
Is this a killer
night or what?

1283
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,443
TGIF.

1284
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:32,382
(laughs evilly)

1285
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,017
Burn baby burn!

1286
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:40,657
Bye bye!

1287
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:43,760
(electric current sizzles)

1288
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:46,830
Smoke if you got 'em!

1289
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:51,168
(electric current sizzles)

1290
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,572
I crack myself up!

1291
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,843
(electronic current sizzles)

1292
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:03,480
Get down!

1293
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:12,289
(fires sizzle)

1294
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:13,990
Suprise!

1295
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,360
Don't even think of trying any

1296
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,163
of that spooky horseshit
on me honey buns.

1297
01:08:19,163 --> 01:08:23,800
Looks like this will be a
1976 you'll never forget,

1298
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,270
well that is until
I finish you off.

1299
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,004
[Voiceover] Attention
Gingerdead Man,

1300
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:30,006
hold on to your cookies!

1301
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:31,541
Oh shit!

1302
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,342
[Randy] Freeze!

1303
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:33,677
(screams)

1304
01:08:33,677 --> 01:08:35,245
This can't be good!

1305
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:37,281
(electronic swooshes)

1306
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:41,985
Tina Joerski, time traveler.

1307
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:44,688
And trusty sidekick Pickles!

1308
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,590
Shut up Pickles!

1309
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:49,726
We're back from a little
trip through time.

1310
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:51,728
Frontways and back.

1311
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:55,499
Yea and uh, we've seen
all the trouble you caused.

1312
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:59,669
Oh come on kiddies, I'm just
a friendly gingerbread man.

1313
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:02,572
I wouldn't hurt a flea, now
give me back my water pistol.

1314
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,040
Sit on it you cookie creep.

1315
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,074
Oh shit.

1316
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,543
Fun time is over.

1317
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:09,879
We brought back a few friends
to help even the score.

1318
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,282
Well bring it on you
little butt biscuit.

1319
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:14,818
When I'm done with you,
I'll give you a tummy ache

1320
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,920
that'll be legendary
even in hell.

1321
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,322
We'll see about that.

1322
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:21,225
Gingerdead Man, meet...

1323
01:09:21,225 --> 01:09:23,760
(electronic current buzzes)

1324
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,295
(uplifting inspiration music)

1325
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:27,030
Adolf Hitler.

1326
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,366
(speaks foreign language)

1327
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,001
(gulps)

1328
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:34,338
Charles Manson.

1329
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:35,839
(electronic swooshes)

1330
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,874
Let's do something witchy!

1331
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:39,243
Uh oh!

1332
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:40,844
Jeffrey Dahmer.

1333
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,547
(electronic air swooshes)

1334
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:46,082
What's for supper?

1335
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,951
Holy...

1336
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,019
And Lizzy Borden.

1337
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:53,257
(electronic air swooshes)

1338
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:56,125
Might I axe what year it is?

1339
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,728
(electronic swooshes)

1340
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:02,098
And you do remember me,
Mr. Gingerdead Man sir?

1341
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:05,969
Clarissa Darling
here, and sorry,

1342
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:09,205
but none of us saved
room for dessert.

1343
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,508
(clears throat)
How could I forget?

1344
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:13,209
It's time for you to go home,

1345
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,513
you crummy little bastard.

1346
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:17,547
Check please!

1347
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,515
(tense powerful music)

1348
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:19,749
Kill him!

1349
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:22,018
Now slow down, I can
explain everything.

1350
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:25,221
You see my daddy didn't
hug me when I was little.

1351
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,423
Oh no, what are you doing?

1352
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:29,025
Oh no you assholes,
I'm warning you.

1353
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,928
I'm warning you
bastards, put me down!

1354
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,797
This is an outrage!

1355
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:38,034
(protests fearfully)

1356
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,036
I'm in the union,
I'm in the union!

1357
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:43,139
Put me down, put me down!

1358
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:46,242
No, no! Ah!

1359
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,746
(screams painfully)

1360
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,014
Yes.

1361
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:55,084
(scream painfully)

1362
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,085
[Gingerdead Man] Cookie Jar?

1363
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,587
Not the cookie jar!

1364
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:02,125
(screams panicked)

1365
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,772
I'll see you all in hell!

1366
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,142
[Little Girl] We did it!

1367
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:20,076
You did!

1368
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:21,578
You all did!

1369
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:23,547
And I wanna thank
you all so very much

1370
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:26,115
for saving the
day, well sort of.

1371
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,817
I mean, it would've been
nice if you could've arrived

1372
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,252
a little earlier.

1373
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,357
Uhm, excuse me Miss Wright?

1374
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:34,658
Yes dear child?

1375
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:36,760
Don't forget, we
have a time machine.

1376
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,494
But...

1377
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:38,762
No buts.

1378
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:40,464
I just went back in time
and warned Miss Darling

1379
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:41,731
what was about to happen,

1380
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,800
so the Gingerdead
Man never escaped.

1381
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,802
And none of this
ever happened!

1382
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,472
(all cheer)

1383
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:50,607
(sparkles twinkle)

1384
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:55,545
(uplifting inspirational
orchestral music)

1385
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,881
(crowd cheers)

1386
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,284
And by the way...

1387
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:02,552
What's this?

1388
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:03,987
A lottery ticket.

1389
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,122
On the way back, we
checked tomorrow's newspaper.

1390
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,825
Congratulations, you
are a millionaire!

1391
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,694
And Roller Boogie
Land is safe!

1392
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:14,898
(crowd cheers)

1393
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:17,834
And disco will live forever!

1394
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,202
Sure it will!

1395
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:23,272
(crowd cheers)

1396
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,948
Let's roller boogie!

1397
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,650
(crowd cheers)

1398
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:38,488
(upbeat disco music)

1399
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:19,596
(air swooshes)

1400
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:21,931
See, I told you
everyone gets their turn

1401
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,667
underneath the mirror ball.

1402
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:26,903
Mind if I hitch a ride?

1403
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,539
But Aunt Trixie,
we need you here.

1404
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,476
This is all yours
now sweet Cherry.

1405
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:34,578
[Randy] Where are you going?

1406
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:39,549
I have a little unfinished
business back in 1941.

1407
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,687
Goodbye Aunt Trixie,

1408
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:45,622
I'll never forget you.

1409
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,528
Take care of each other,
and stay away from sweets.

1410
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:52,996
Aloha everyone!

1411
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,565
[All] Aloha!

1412
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:56,833
[Little Girl] All
right everybody,

1413
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,067
you ready to go back home?

1414
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,402
(air swooshes)

1415
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,737
And behave yourselves!

1416
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:01,938
Wee!

1417
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,508
(laughs boisterously)

1418
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:07,143
Calabunga!

1419
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:10,113
(speaks foreign language)

1420
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,215
Yea!

1421
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,917
Peace out mother fucker!

1422
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:17,053
Aloha!

1423
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:21,190

1427
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:24,714
* I'm going to
disco you to death

1428
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:31,254

1432
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:59,916
* Grooving in your satin pants,
you're gonna live forever

1433
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,818
* Come on disco baby

1434
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,420
* Let's cut the rug

1435
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,591
* Trip the light, fantastic,
'til the room is red with blood

1436
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:12,261
* I'm gonna disco you to death

1437
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:18,768
* It's 1970 something so
it's coke instead of meth

disco 'til you drop

1439
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:25,241
* You're heart's been overheated

1440
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:27,310
* But that's finally gonna pop

1441
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,313
* Listen to your heart pump

1442
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,215
* As we do the bump

1443
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,018
* Dig that bass guitar from

1444
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:37,520
* Get up off your rump

1445
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,487
* If looks could kill

1446
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,756
* You'd dance until

1447
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:42,125
* My eyes cut like a knife

1448
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,593
* And leave you on
the dance floor crying

1449
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:47,330

1450
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:50,199
