1
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,635
I've made
a lot of mistakes in my life...

2
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,235
choices I can never change.

3
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,002
We grew up having
to be soldiers around here.

4
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:12,201
Most don't make it
past the age of 24.

5
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:22,434
But I never thought
it would come to this.

6
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,702
So, Bobby,
you gonna call Gina?

7
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,734
I don't know, bro.
She seem to be tripping.

8
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,067
Yeah, I heard she had fleas and shit.

9
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:48,034
No wonder my balls have been itching.

10
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,734
- And that's not the worst.
- You want to talk about the worst?

11
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,901
The best part of you
ran down your mother's leg.

12
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,902
- Oh.
- Nah, bro, she ain't got no fleas.

13
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,600
¿Más Cafecito?

14
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,001
It's from your dirty-ass house.

15
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:01,599
But seriously though, dawg,

16
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,601
does your mom like having
a dirty-ass house?

17
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:29,802
Hold up,
we're the only ones here, right?

18
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,001
Shut up, bitch.
You ain't gonna do shit.

19
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,834
Don't fuck around, Jason.

20
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,900
What are you thinking, bro?

21
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,602
Well, I was thinking that, uh,

22
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,602
Bobby and Derek go watch
the door and take a lookout

23
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,434
while me and Julian
go get the cash.

24
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:05,368
Whoa, fuck that, dude. We come here
all the time. They know who we are.

25
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,567
- You're such a pussy, bro.
- Yo, be cool, man.

26
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:11,599
I'll do it.

27
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,301
All right,
me and Derek will do it.

28
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:16,134
You two just go watch the door.

29
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,234
Little bitches.

30
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,535
That is so fucking stupid.

31
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,200
Hey, yo, hurry the fuck up!

32
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,234
- We're so fucking busted.
- Hey, man!

33
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,435
Shut the fuck up, stop being
a little bitch and watch the door!

34
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:34,800
Hurry up.

35
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:38,102
Shit. Get the money.

36
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,366
What are you do...

37
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,067
- Shit.
- What the fuck, Jason?

38
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:48,633
Get the money.

39
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,367
Let's go. Come on, go.

40
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:52,100
That is so fucking stupid!

41
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,233
You know what?
You said it yourself, bitch--

42
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,467
they know us,
and I ain't about to go to jail.

43
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:59,401
Well, you should have sat there
and ate your fucking torta, asshole.

44
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,202
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Come on.

45
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,267
After that night,

46
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:43,367
things were never the same.

47
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,267
It seemed as though Julian and I

48
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,901
were the only ones who grew up.

49
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,901
Jason and Derek just got worse.

50
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,634
- Whoo!
- Bobby!

51
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

52
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,234
Or at least Jason did.

53
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:05,502
Derek was just a little tagalong.

54
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,001
He did whatever Jason told him.

55
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,833
Hey, say hi to your mom for me.

56
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,900
These high school graduates.

57
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,500
So how does it feel, mijo?

58
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,401
I don't know.
It hasn't really sunk in yet.

59
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,134
What, that you'll be attending

60
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,934
West Virginia University
in the fall, or what?

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,235
No, that you're gonna blow
your entire life savings

62
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,967
on sending us both to college.

63
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,601
Each class gotta be about what,
like, 100 satellite dishes?

64
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,102
Órale, I don't want you guys
to think about that, okay?

65
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,700
That's mine.
That's what I have to worry about.

66
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,033
¿'ta bueno?

67
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,167
I know this is
a special day for you guys,

68
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:45,001
but I need you
to remember one thing:

69
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,901
One day does not define a man.

70
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,568
¿Entiendes?

71
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:52,200
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Pop.

72
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:55,701
Bobby, let me get a picture
of you guys real quick.

73
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,234
Yeah.

74
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,600
Orale.

75
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,300
Smile. Perfect.

76
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,201
My high school graduates.

77
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey, I'm gonna go
talk to these guys.

78
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,734
- Okay.
- Good seeing you.

79
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,867
Mucho cuidado.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,068
Derek, we got us
some college boys in our crew now.

81
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:16,766
Julian, you know
you're my hero now, right?

82
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,568
Oh-ho-ho, well
let me save you, Derek.

83
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,700
What, you're all badass
now or what?

84
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,801
Give me a fucking hug, asshole.

85
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,902
Hey, man, watch your mouth
in front of my pops, all right?

86
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:29,569
I'm sorry, señor.
I'm just really proud of su hijo.

87
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:32,835
- Tell 'em about the party, fool.
- Go ahead, tell 'em.

88
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,034
We're throwing you vatos
a party at this fool's pad.

89
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,434
- Oh, shit.
- So when can we expect you?

90
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:40,501
Y'all better come, eh?
We got cakes, trash can punch y todo.

91
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,067
Well, hell, I'm in.
I'll be there.

92
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,867
- Yeah? You in?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,468
All right.
How about you, Julian? You in?

94
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,834
Or are you a little pussy
like you always are?

95
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,000
At least I got a house, fool.

96
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,133
This one gets a piece of paper
and grows some balls.

97
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,900
Let me show it to you,
motherfucker.

98
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:00,101
Hey, put that shit away,
for real, for real.

99
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:03,434
We're proud of you guys,
real fucking proud.

100
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,368
Bring some bitches
to the party tonight, all right?

101
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:09,833
And not just him.

102
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,001
Tell your moms I'll pick her up
at 8:00, yeah? Cool?

103
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,966
That's not funny, dawg.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,468
Ahí voy.

105
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:26,833
Hi.

106
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,433
I'm so proud of you.

107
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,133
Thanks, Mrs. Fernandez.
It wasn't easy.

108
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:42,833
I don't know.
She's your daughter.

109
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,567
I'm gonna miss you, Mrs. Fernandez.

110
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:54,866
Where's Gina?

111
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:00,801
¡Ay, Chingada!

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,801
Hey.

113
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,267
Hi.

114
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:10,402
Oh, Bobby.

115
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,901
Baby.

116
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,767
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it

117
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,701
to your graduation.

118
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,267
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

119
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,167
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

120
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:29,701
There's nothing left to say

121
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:33,569
I wanna take it for what it's for

122
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:35,333
And, baby, bring it...

123
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,200
I love you so much.

124
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,169
I'ma have your life...

125
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,334
So are you gonna be okay?

126
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,601
Yeah.

127
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,068
I don't need no man.

128
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,433
Look at you.

129
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:07,236
You think you're all bad now.

130
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:10,135
I can see it in your eyes.

131
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,301
Nah.

132
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:25,268
How long are
you gonna be gone for?

133
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,201
Four, maybe five years.

134
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:37,234
But you can come visit me
any time you want.

135
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,934
Yeah.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,769
I can't afford that.

137
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:50,234
Well, I could send you some money.

138
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,868
Or better yet,
I could send you some plane tickets.

139
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,468
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,667
Gina.

141
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,401
Gina, look at me.

142
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:09,001
- What?
- Hey.

143
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:12,935
Hey, look at me.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,268
It's okay.

145
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:23,167
Would you promise me one thing?

146
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:28,333
Yeah.

147
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:30,399
What?

148
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,067
You'll wait for me?

149
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:39,767
Yeah.

150
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,766
I'll wait for you.

151
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,435
The gloves is off,
the sword is sharp

152
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:49,168
I swear to God, this time
I am leaving a mark

153
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,034
And I dare a motherfucker
to say something about Bugsy

154
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,201
They find ya bitch-ass in Kentucky

155
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,100
Nothing will get in my way

156
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:59,001
I'm willing to pay
however much it cost...

157
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,866
Bobby, you made it.

158
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,501
I thought I told you to bring
some fucking bitches, man, come on.

159
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,534
This is the only chick I travel with.

160
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,568
Aww, don't do that shit
in front of me, come on.

161
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:11,800
- Besides, don't you have Derek?
- Aww, fuck you.

162
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,500
What's up, bitches?

163
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,935
Is that the only chick you brought?

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,935
- Duh.
- It's the only chick I need.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,269
- You whooped-ass motherfucker.
- You're fucked up,

166
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:26,635
Get your-- come on,
get out of here, fool. Stupid ass.

167
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,367
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

168
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:29,966
Have a drink,
smoke some weed,

169
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,967
do whatever you want
with your girl.

170
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,967
I'm gonna get that girl over there.

171
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:36,467
She's been eye-fucking me
all night, man. Fuck.

172
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,967
- Have fun, all right?
- All right, thank you, man. Thank you.

173
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,935
You will refer to me as King,
and I run SA...

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,035
How are y'all doing?
I'm Julian.

175
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:48,302
Can I get you ladies a beer? Yeah?

176
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:51,001
Hey, move, pussy.

177
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:54,467
Really, dude? What the fuck
is your problem, bro?

178
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,534
What the fuck?
You ain't gonna do shit.

179
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,701
I ain't gonna do shit?

180
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:03,368
What, you gonna do something?
Do something, bitch.

181
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,301
Go. Go.
Do something.

182
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,434
Punk-ass bitch,
that's what I thought.

183
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,267
- What the fuck, bitch?
- Oh, what?

184
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:16,900
- Hey, hey!
- Who's the pussy now? Do it.

185
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,368
Come on, do it.
Do your boy, bro.

186
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:22,134
- Come on, put one in my fucking dome.
- What the fuck?

187
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,968
- What the hell?
- I'm tired of this fucking pendejo

188
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,467
always running in my shit.

189
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,133
- What the fuck?
- What?

190
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:31,466
What?

191
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,033
He grabbed my dick, bro.

192
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,733
I wouldn't touch your pito chiquito

193
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,500
with a fucking ten-foot pole, bro.

194
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,768
He fucking grabbed your dick?
That's why you pull out the fucking gun?

195
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,501
Come on, man,
you're fucking up the party.

196
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:45,402
I gotta keep this motherfucker
in check every once in a while, bro.

197
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,900
Hey, put the gun away, man.

198
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,168
Man, I overreacted.
I overreacted.

199
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:51,467
Hey, go back to partying, man.
What the fuck?

200
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,966
Shut the fuck up, man.

201
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:56,168
Hey, hey, nothing can come
between us, right?

202
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,601
Especially with all the shit
we've fucking been through.

203
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,401
Come on, stupid.

204
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:06,934
My bad.

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,801
Get a fucking drink.

206
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,201
"Overreacted" is a big
fucking word for you, Mexican.

207
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,000
Pulling out a fucking gun.

208
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:15,467
Come on, bro, let's get
some fucking pizza, some pizza.

209
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,234
Oh, pito chiquito.

210
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,767
Do you want a beer?

211
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,133
Yes.

212
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,133
It's foamy.

213
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,167
Very foamy.
That's yours.

214
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,568
- Love you, Pop.
- I love you, too.

215
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:39,533
- Phone home, cabrón.
- I will.

216
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,734
Mucho cuidado.

217
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,601
Julian.

218
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,601
I want to tell you, mijo,

219
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,601
that I'm very, very proud of you.

220
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,035
And I'm pretty sure

221
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,800
your parents would be
proud of you too, mijo.

222
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,801
No, no, en serio.

223
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:59,101
And no matter what anybody says...

224
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,700
you're my son.

225
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,734
¿'ta bueno?

226
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,467
Stop it.
Stop it.

227
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,600
Stop it with that
teary-eyed shit, eh?

228
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,501
You're supposed to be
happy right now.

229
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,500
Cuídate, okay?

230
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,168
My father took Julian in
when he was 10.

231
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:48,034
His parents were in and out
of rehab for most of his life.

232
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,568
Sometimes the place you're from
and the people you love

233
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:57,034
are the only things
holding you down.

234
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,569
We can never erase what happened,

235
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:04,567
but when you get the opportunity

236
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,735
to do something right,

237
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,467
you take it.

238
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:17,401
Robert Ramirez, Julian Medina,

239
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,868
pack up your stuff
and come with me.

240
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,701
Bobby, what do you think
this is about, man?

241
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:26,935
I don't know, man.

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,102
I mean,
we didn't do anything, right?

243
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,233
Relax. Here they come.

244
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,300
Gentlemen, Agent Montelongo.

245
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,035
Afternoon. Have a seat.

246
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:39,135
We don't have a lot of time,
so were gonna get right into this.

247
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,833
You know this guy?

248
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,334
What about this guy?

249
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,102
That's Jason.
We all grew up together.

250
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:50,801
How do they feel about you two
graduating from the academy?

251
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,133
How would they know?

252
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,336
Childhood friends and all,
you'd think--

253
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,902
No, this is something
Julian and I decided to do.

254
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,201
We kept it from everyone
but our father.

255
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,033
I mean, not because we're ashamed

256
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:06,000
but just 'cause we didn't think
they would understand.

257
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,867
Good.
That's all I needed to know.

258
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:12,803
Jason and Derek are connected
to a man that goes by Nadie.

259
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,568
He's on our Most Wanted list
and I want his ass.

260
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:18,401
You two are being assigned
to get Nadie,

261
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:21,669
immediately following
tomorrow's graduation ceremony.

262
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,167
Congratulations.

263
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,968
Robert, you're gonna do
some time in jail--

264
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,234
just a little actual time.

265
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,334
The rest will be added
to the system.

266
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,434
A couple of B&Es,
minor offenses--

267
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,101
nothing crazy.
You'll get all the details.

268
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,100
Julian,

269
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,333
you're the smartest kid
at the academy.

270
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,368
We want your help running
this thing from a distance.

271
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:45,001
No one knows
these two better than you two.

272
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:47,600
We're very lucky
to have you on our team.

273
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,869
I've set up a meeting
with the captain of the SAPD.

274
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,868
We'll brief you more then.

275
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,335
Good luck, gentlemen.

276
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,301
This is the shit
you came to the academy for.

277
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:24,236
I found out Pops was sick
when we graduated.

278
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,568
The only contact we'd had
with him was over the phone.

279
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,601
He never said anything.

280
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,334
And he didn't start to sound bad

281
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,268
until the cancer finally
took total control of his lungs.

282
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,801
It was hard to see him like that.

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,935
But my father would
rather have died

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,534
than missed seeing his
little homeboys

285
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,234
graduate from the
FBI Academy.

286
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:09,735
It was a sad day when
my father died.

287
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:13,868
He was all I had for most
of my life.

288
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:19,433
You be strong, mijo.

289
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,868
Don't ever let me

290
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:25,802
or your father down, okay?

291
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,600
You do as he says.

292
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:33,367
He loves you

293
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:36,201
more than anything in this world.

294
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,133
Acércate.

295
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:52,701
And after my mother died,

296
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,101
Pops made me strong

297
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,101
and helped me to understand
that there's a plan for all of us.

298
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:19,501
My father's death
was especially hard on Julian.

299
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:23,368
He was the only true father
he ever knew.

300
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:46,702
Julian was only 13
when they overdosed.

301
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:53,001
He refused to go to their funeral.

302
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:15,301
After we buried my father,

303
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:18,702
Julian was the only family
I had left.

304
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,102
Agent Ramirez, Medina,
pleasure to meet you.

305
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,800
- I heard nothing but good things.
- Cap.

306
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:53,269
You guys ready to work?

307
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,500
Good, 'cause I'm gonna need you

308
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,701
to get closer to Jason
than we originally anticipated.

309
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:59,367
This thing's a little bigger
than we actually thought.

310
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:00,666
How much bigger?

311
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,434
Nadie pretty much owns Texas.

312
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:04,500
He's got connections
in and out of the US.

313
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,801
This guy's set up shop
in just about every major city.

314
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,069
He's got a legion of followers
as young as goddamn 10-years-old.

315
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:12,567
If the Bureau knows so much,
why can't you bring him down?

316
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,501
As it stands right now,
we can't directly link him to anything.

317
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,335
Legally speaking,
this guy's untouchable.

318
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:21,468
- Why is SAPD involved?
- We have reason to believe

319
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,867
that one of our finest
might be on the payroll.

320
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,601
And not a lot of badges
know about this at all

321
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,300
'cause there's not
many people we can trust.

322
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:30,769
Seems like Nadie only trusts Jason
and Derek and people that he brings in.

323
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,801
That's where you come in.
You understand?

324
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,168
I don't see how anyone
could trust those two.

325
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:38,234
Well, they may be the only two
that know Nadie's true identity.

326
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,234
To everybody else,
it's just a name.

327
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,834
Cool.
Let's do it.

328
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:45,234
You understand?

329
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,401
All right, gentlemen,
get out of here.

330
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:49,434
I'll set it up.

331
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:58,301
Is this what four years of college

332
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,035
and six months in the academy
gets you these days?

333
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:03,234
We wouldn't have to put
rookies on the case

334
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,668
if you were in control
of your own backyard.

335
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,400
In the last two years

336
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:17,835
San Antonio has become victim

337
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,867
to organized crime

338
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,902
and drug trafficking
at an intolerable level.

339
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,234
Our children are becoming

340
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:27,734
drug addicts and criminals

341
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,101
right before our very eyes.

342
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:33,401
This must come to an end.

343
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:35,935
If you know of any illegal activity

344
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,303
or of anyone involved
in this epidemic,

345
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,135
please contact
your local authorities immediately.

346
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:45,001
Hey, you gotta pay your tab.

347
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,833
Well, how much do I owe you?

348
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,533
$15, plus tip.

349
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,634
15 bucks for three beers
in this shithole?

350
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,501
Here's a tip:
Why don't you clean this bitch up?

351
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,801
Just pay the tab, pinche guey.

352
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:00,834
Empty out the fucking register,
now!

353
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,867
Nobody fucking move.

354
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,233
What?

355
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,668
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the gun!

356
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,101
Drop the gun now!

357
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,868
Hey, relax.

358
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,033
You're under arrest.

359
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,366
I figured.

360
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,467
Watch your head.

361
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:34,867
- We have one in custody.
- 10-4.

362
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,835
Fuck you, asshole.

363
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,435
I'm too sexy for my shirt...

364
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,701
Yeah, what's up?

365
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,801
Yeah, I just got here.

366
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:06,034
All right, all right.

367
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,200
You're free to go.

368
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:25,100
Apparently someone thinks
you're worth a damn.

369
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:42,066
Derek?

370
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:44,733
Surprise, surprise.

371
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,867
Damn.

372
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:49,135
- Hey, man.
- Look at you.

373
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,200
Look at you.
Moving up in the world, huh?

374
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,866
Just a little bit.

375
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,702
- Badass.
- Just doing my thing.

376
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:57,567
Did you bail me out?

377
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,800
Hell yeah, I bailed you out.
How do you think you got out of there?

378
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,334
Thank you.

379
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,701
I don't know how to repay you.
I can't repay you.

380
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,801
Don't worry about it. I got you.

381
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,701
Is that yours?

382
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:10,001
Hell yeah. Come on, let me
show you what else has changed.

383
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,801
Where the hell you been at, man?

384
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:14,133
In there.

385
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,534
I used to be on the block all day

386
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,568
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

387
00:25:19,632 --> 00:25:22,034
I flip that, did hits and I'm on

388
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,534
They still want to lock me up, oh

389
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,600
They want to give me life...

390
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,467
Listen, grab yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.

391
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:30,767
- All right.
- What are you having?

392
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:34,570
Oh... vodka on the rocks.

393
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,667
So how long has this place been open?

394
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,701
About two years.

395
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,867
What do I owe you?

396
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:43,467
Oh, nothing.
It's on the house, man.

397
00:25:43,532 --> 00:25:46,001
Oh, rock 'n' roll, man. Thanks.

398
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:49,067
Bobby Ramirez.

399
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,200
Bobby Ramirez.

400
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:53,467
- Come on, man, get over here.
- God.

401
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,800
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you. How have you been?

402
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:58,001
Damn, look at you.

403
00:25:58,065 --> 00:26:00,333
What's up with you?
That's the question.

404
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,635
Well, you know, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

405
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:05,100
I need some of that.

406
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,434
It's good to see
you and Derek doing so well.

407
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:10,733
Yeah, you know.

408
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,800
What kind of trouble
are you getting yourself into?

409
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,200
Eh, you know.

410
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:15,899
Little college boy,

411
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:18,001
you were all straight and narrow
and shit, come on.

412
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:19,499
People change.

413
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:21,834
What do you mean?

414
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,335
I fucked up, jacked a bar.

415
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:29,866
Yeah, don't worry,
I won't be robbing this place.

416
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,101
God damn,
that's what I'm talking about.

417
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,333
- Shit.
- Fucking money's tight, you know.

418
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,134
That bad, huh?

419
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:39,068
Eh, shit just kind of went downhill
after Pops passed.

420
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:42,502
Yeah, I heard about it.
I'm sorry, Bobby.

421
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:45,835
No, don't be.
It's just life.

422
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:47,734
Anyway, how's Julian doing, man?

423
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,268
Oh, he's killing it, man, working for
some big company up in New York.

424
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:52,333
No shit.
Who'd have ever guessed--

425
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,334
that little bitch
always scared and shit?

426
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,834
He'll surprise you.

427
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,268
Hey, let's--
let's grab two shots.

428
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:02,068
Don't worry about paying me back
for bailing you out.

429
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:04,467
Joe, let's get two shots
for this guy,

430
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,267
celebrate my boy's return.

431
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:07,566
Joe.

432
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,534
Don't you got something to do?

433
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:16,733
Yeah.

434
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,400
Never write it down...

435
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,401
- Salud.
- Cheers.

436
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:22,401
If you riding it right

437
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,167
If you riding with us,
you riding for life.

438
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:26,500
Shit, whatever happened to Melissa?

439
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:29,201
Oh, dude.

440
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:32,234
She left my sheets
all bloody, man, oh.

441
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:34,768
You know,
I videotaped that shit too.

442
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,467
I videotaped that motherfucker.

443
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,133
Come on, come on.

444
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,200
God damn, you've done well.

445
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:43,900
- Well, you'd be amazed.
- By what?

446
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,735
- What?
- You said I'd be amazed.

447
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,267
Yeah, well, you'd be amazed

448
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,834
at what kind of money you can get

449
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,934
by not doing shit.

450
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,968
What do you mean?

451
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:01,867
You hear of Nadie?

452
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:05,966
Nadie?

453
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,534
- Yeah, Nadie.
- What, is it "no one"?

454
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,836
Yeah, Nadie--
he's a real person.

455
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,834
No.

456
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,969
Well, he's the world's
leading importer-exporter.

457
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,568
In what?

458
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:28,867
Do you work for him?

459
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,467
He bought you that shirt?

460
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:32,467
Yeah, he bought me
this fucking shirt, yeah.

461
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,467
- Bought you this house?
- He bought me this fucking house

462
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:36,300
and these shoes
and this fucking watch.

463
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,801
No, I am him.

464
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:42,035
What, you're Nadie?

465
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,067
Yeah.

466
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:52,434
So what do you import?

467
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,367
Anything and everything.

468
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:58,367
You see, the thing is,

469
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,567
I never get my hands dirty.

470
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,900
How?

471
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:10,367
I broker the shit.

472
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,934
I'm the organizer, the maker,

473
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,168
the pusher and the seller.

474
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:17,767
But I never touch anything.

475
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:22,802
- Why are you telling me this?
- You asked.

476
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:25,268
Yeah, I know I fucking asked,
but this is some heavy-ass shit.

477
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,901
You fucking asked.
You fucking asked.

478
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:33,000
Man, Bobby.

479
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,533
You should come work for me, man,

480
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,134
put a little--
a little extra change in your pocket.

481
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:42,969
No. I don't know, bro.

482
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,601
What?
You don't know?

483
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,200
You don't know?

484
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,767
- I don't know.
- You know what?

485
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,902
You're the same fucking pussy
you were in high school.

486
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:58,369
You are the same
fucking pussy you were in high school.

487
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:00,367
Nothing fucking changes.

488
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,967
The same fucking pussy,
like this, look.

489
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:05,567
Come on, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

490
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,266
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

491
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:09,200
I just got popped two seconds ago.

492
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,566
And?

493
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:17,501
Anyway, how do you know
you can trust me?

494
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,967
Shit, man.

495
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,766
After all we've been through...

496
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:28,033
all we've been through, man...

497
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:30,500
why wouldn't I?

498
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:36,967
Shit. Fuck.

499
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:38,700
It's nice seeing you,
motherfucker.

500
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:40,868
It's nice seeing you.

501
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:43,235
Good to see you too, man.

502
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,668
Aww, man, fucking Bobby.

503
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:48,268
Come on, get one.

504
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:50,667
Get one, huh?

505
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,068
Get one. That's some
high-quality shit right there.

506
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,934
- Courtesy of Nadie.
- You.

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,469
- Courtesy of Nadie.
- I think I like Nadie.

508
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,734
My turn.

509
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,767
My turn, motherfucker.

510
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,033
You dumb motherfucker!

511
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:46,667
Oh, motherfucker.

512
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:48,468
You know whose money
you're fucking with?

513
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,567
Oh, fuck.

514
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,534
Jason just funds everything

515
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,200
and we do all the actual work.

516
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:36,635
He just kicks back
and watches his bankroll get fatter.

517
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,501
Have you seen that guy's house?

518
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:42,335
Can he be traced though?

519
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,136
Only if we can connect
Jason to the buyers.

520
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,401
See, each buyer sets up
a dummy company,

521
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,534
and that company
pays Jason.

522
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,302
And he's smart.
And he's not greedy.

523
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,334
He doesn't nickel-and-dime shit.

524
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,068
Oh, shit, there he is.

525
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,534
Did you know he was gonna be here?

526
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,267
Come on, Bobby,

527
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,101
do you really think
this is a coincidence?

528
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:08,834
Bobby.

529
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,200
Mira ese pinche guey.

530
00:34:12,265 --> 00:34:15,301
- Holy shit, man.
- Good to see you, papá.

531
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:16,967
You didn't tell me he was in town.

532
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:18,800
He just got in.

533
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:20,434
May I?

534
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:22,934
- Yeah, have a seat.
- Good seeing you, man.

535
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:27,202
Bobby, is everything good?

536
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,133
- What happened?
- No, it's just this thing.

537
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,534
Yeah, I put a couple guys on it.
It's cool.

538
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,334
All right.

539
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,434
What brings you to town?

540
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,934
The job, man-- I got laid off,

541
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,568
had to come back home.

542
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:41,367
Sorry to hear that, man.

543
00:34:41,432 --> 00:34:42,866
Shit happens, you know.

544
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:43,967
It's all right.

545
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:50,034
Hello. What?

546
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,100
Yeah, I'll be right there.

547
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:55,334
Sorry, guys, I gotta run.

548
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,870
Hey, but don't worry about
losing your job too much.

549
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,602
I... may have some work for you.

550
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,834
Gracias, man.

551
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:07,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah, appreciate it.

552
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:08,967
- You game?
- Yeah, you know me. I'm down.

553
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:10,767
All right.
See you later.

554
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,801
All right.

555
00:35:26,232 --> 00:35:28,534
What the fuck is Julian
doing back around here?

556
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,667
I guess he just moved back.

557
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,068
I could use the manpower right now.

558
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,667
I don't trust that guy.

559
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,935
Yeah, but he's cool.

560
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,001
All right?

561
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:42,032
Remember...

562
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:45,033
we were all there.

563
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,466
Let's go.

564
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,267
What the fuck are you doing?

565
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,033
What?

566
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,401
I thought you weren't
supposed to get involved.

567
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:12,036
Come on, Bobby, I'm tired
of being a fucking desk monkey, bro.

568
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,034
I signed up to see some action,

569
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,867
you know what I mean?

570
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,867
Look, I get it.

571
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,868
Okay?
I just didn't--

572
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:23,801
I just didn't want you
on this side of things.

573
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,534
What, Bobby?

574
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,034
What, the drugs, the partying?

575
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,202
Man, you forget we used
to run these streets together, bro.

576
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:34,201
Give me a little credit.

577
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:36,233
I got this.

578
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,868
Then look me in the eyes
and tell me you got this.

579
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:47,500
I got it.

580
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:51,034
Okay?

581
00:36:53,532 --> 00:36:55,267
Okay.

582
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:02,435
Has Jason mentioned Gina yet?

583
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:04,434
Gina? No. Why?

584
00:37:04,499 --> 00:37:07,535
I haven't even seen her.

585
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,600
You should ask him about it, bro.

586
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,468
You get the tickets I sent you?

587
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, I did.

588
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:22,133
Are you excited to be coming out?

589
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,002
Mm, I don't know, Bobby.

590
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:28,600
You know, I have beauty school.

591
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,734
And you know what my instructor said?

592
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,400
That I'm a natural.

593
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:35,333
Well, yeah, but I--

594
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:37,334
I spent a lot of money on those tickets.

595
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:39,601
What do you want me to do, Bobby?

596
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,601
I can't just drop everything

597
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:44,235
and fly across the country
just to go see you.

598
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:46,034
What are you talking about?

599
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,267
I mean, you promised.

600
00:37:53,265 --> 00:37:56,534
Okay, I'm gonna come.

601
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:59,967
I love you.

602
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,134
I love you too.

603
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,634
I'll be waiting for you, okay?

604
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,267
Adiós.

605
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:50,367
What's happening?

606
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,167
How are you doing, brother?

607
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:55,400
Good to see you, man.

608
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:57,601
Hey, brother.

609
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,467
Bobby.

610
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:05,033
Thank you.

611
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,435
To the man who keeps
our pockets fat and us out of jail.

612
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:11,334
- En los ojos, ¿eh?
- To you.

613
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:13,834
- Seven years of bad sex.
- Seriously.

614
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,701
Having a good time, Bobby?

615
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,901
Can't complain.

616
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:23,236
See, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

617
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:28,867
Hey, get up.

618
00:42:33,265 --> 00:42:35,967
That's what I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

619
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,733
See, when you left,

620
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:43,035
Gina and I-- we--

621
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,701
you know, I hope there's
no hard feelings, right?

622
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,967
How are you, Bobby?

623
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:51,534
You know, I've been. And you?

624
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,968
I can't complain.

625
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,534
You should go.

626
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,234
I don't know what to say, Bobby.

627
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:26,435
A prize like that needed
someone to take care of her.

628
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:28,567
A trophy always needs polishing.

629
00:43:28,632 --> 00:43:31,935
It's like you said,
I'm the one that left, right?

630
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,669
It is what it is.

631
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,234
We cool, right?

632
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,834
Hell yeah, we're cool.

633
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:40,867
I mean,
look at all you've done for me.

634
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:44,436
That's right.
That's right.

635
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,601
Derek, I need to talk
to Bobby about something.

636
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,634
Take your girl.

637
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,834
No, no, Julian, Julian,
you're good.

638
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:57,001
You're good.
Have a seat.

639
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:59,600
Come on, let's go.

640
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:05,501
There's a job I need
you to do for me.

641
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:07,034
What is it?

642
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,701
It's a little vacation.

643
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:11,367
I need you to go to
Mexico for me.

644
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:14,368
Work hard, play harder, right?

645
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:16,467
That's right. That's right.

646
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,502
That's that.
Come over here.

647
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,134
Hey, Brent.
How are you doing, man?

648
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,567
Hey, Derek, what's up, bro?

649
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,735
Dude, the señoritas
in here are prime.

650
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,901
We try.

651
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:37,002
Listen, how did that--
that lead I gave you-- how did it go?

652
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:39,467
Oh, yeah, man. Hey, you really
helped us deliver on that one, man.

653
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:40,799
Good.

654
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:42,801
If there's anything
we can do for you,

655
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:45,301
you should let us know,
all right?

656
00:44:45,366 --> 00:44:48,268
- Anything you need, man.
- I appreciate that.

657
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:49,866
Matter of fact, you know what?

658
00:44:49,933 --> 00:44:51,868
I have some friends
that just came into town.

659
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:53,734
I haven't seen them in a while.

660
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,700
I want you to run them for me.

661
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:58,435
All right, we can do that.

662
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:00,000
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

663
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:01,599
Cool.

664
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,935
Joe, take care of them.
Have a good time.

665
00:45:22,432 --> 00:45:22,432
There are 25 points
in the first quarter.

666
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,435
There are 25 points
in the first quarter.

667
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:28,034
The average is 80 points a game,
and the guy's a freshman.

668
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,034
Hey, Terry.
You know what I mean?

669
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,234
It's all about the young talent.

670
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:35,402
It's like college teams are
always better than the pro teams,

671
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,501
that's all there is too it.
'Cause the pros don't give a shit.

672
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:40,101
They're making too much.
Baseball, basketball-- you name it.

673
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:42,400
Don't even get me started
On soccer.

674
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:45,735
It's the most boring sport
that's ever existed.

675
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:48,034
I honestly don't understand
how people can watch it.

676
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:49,600
It's like you kick the ball,
you kick the ball,

677
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,667
you kick the ball one way--
nothing happens.

678
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:54,202
You kick the ball, you kick the ball
the other way-- nothing happens.

679
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:56,800
So boring.
Final score-- one-nothing.

680
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:58,667
That's exciting.

681
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:05,934
What?

682
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:33,434
- Jesus Christ.
- I told you.

683
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:38,935
Jesus.

684
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,669
- There's the man.
- Fuck, bro.

685
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:45,303
Escobar called.
He wants his fucking house back.

686
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:48,035
Have you ever had your nails done
by an Asian woman?

687
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,036
- Uh, no. Have you?
- Fuck no.

688
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:54,634
Well, I have this theory.

689
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:57,034
See, a man with clean nails

690
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,868
cares for himself.

691
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:02,268
A man that cares for himself

692
00:47:02,332 --> 00:47:04,000
cares for his life.

693
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:08,102
I find it tends to cleanse
my conscience,

694
00:47:08,165 --> 00:47:11,401
like a Catholic, you know,
saying those Hail Marys.

695
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:20,668
Do you care about your life,
Julian?

696
00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:23,268
What the fuck are you
talking about, J?

697
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:29,934
No.

698
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,435
Why did you do that?

699
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:33,700
He's our brother.

700
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:35,801
No no no!

701
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:38,568
He was your brother.

702
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:41,768
And your brother was
a fucking pig.

703
00:47:43,632 --> 00:47:46,234
That's impossible,
you sick fuck.

704
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,200
Is it, Bobby?

705
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:52,966
Oh, man,
look what you did to him.

706
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:54,566
- Is it?
- Look at him.

707
00:47:54,632 --> 00:47:56,567
Why the fuck did I have a camera

708
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:58,600
following me around
for the past two weeks?

709
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,667
I'm not stupid.

710
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:06,167
That's fucking bullshit.

711
00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:08,601
Who told you that, huh?

712
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:12,002
Tell me, motherfucker!

713
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:15,168
Don't forget who I am.

714
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,534
What kind of brother doesn't know

715
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,268
his own blood is a fucking cop?

716
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,766
I should pop you too.

717
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,768
Yeah? What are you accusing me of?

718
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,602
Huh? Huh?

719
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,467
Say it, motherfucker!

720
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,300
Say it!

721
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:35,235
After all we've been through.

722
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,868
I live my whole life

723
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:40,868
with blood on my hands

724
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,168
from what you did.

725
00:48:46,332 --> 00:48:48,434
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

726
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:51,668
Man, give me-- give me--
give me the gun.

727
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:53,568
Give me the fucking gun.
Let her go.

728
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:56,267
Let her go. Let her go.

729
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:59,601
Get the fuck out of here.

730
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,134
You got work to do.

731
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,569
Be happy I'm gonna put this
motherfucker where he can be found.

732
00:49:05,632 --> 00:49:07,934
Why did you do this to him?

733
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,102
Oh, man.

734
00:49:12,232 --> 00:49:14,400
Oh, and, hermano,

735
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:17,101
you should thank Derek
for keeping us out of jail--

736
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,433
all of us.

737
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,235
I mean, really,
I mean, how well--

738
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:25,869
how well do you really
know people anyway?

739
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:27,734
Huh?

740
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:46,001
Come on.

741
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:05,901
Oh.

742
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:07,901
Please just-- just take--

743
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,801
just take care of him, please.

744
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:25,333
Why did you do it, Maria? Why?

745
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:27,167
Put that pinche gun away.

746
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,833
You're not gonna do anything, pussy.

747
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:31,401
You're a fucking pussy.
I hope your son doesn't end up like you.

748
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:33,401
Eres un pedazo de mierda,
bueno para nada.

749
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:02,467
This is bullshit.

750
00:51:03,899 --> 00:51:06,735
Listen, Bobby,
I understand how you feel, I do.

751
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,233
Look, I don't understand
why we can't just

752
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,100
bring him in on a murder charge.

753
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:13,134
I mean, he shot Julian
right in front of my fucking face.

754
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,100
- I understand that.
- I'll testify.

755
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:18,735
All right? We can get
the Asian lady to be a second witness.

756
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:20,800
Walk with me, son.

757
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:26,334
A single murder charge
is a state conviction, all right?

758
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:28,868
The FBI is not gonna risk blowing

759
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:31,235
an undercover operation
that could take down

760
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:34,502
the single largest drug trafficking
organization in North America

761
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:36,301
- on simple murder charge.
- A simple murder charge?

762
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:39,035
That's not what I meant.
Now I said I was sorry for our loss,

763
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,067
and you need to fucking
understand this shit.

764
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:43,067
Bigger picture, son.

765
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:46,101
Look at this objectively.
We're a collective.

766
00:51:46,165 --> 00:51:48,534
That loss affects
each and every one of us.

767
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:53,502
We can lock him up
for the rest of his life.

768
00:51:53,566 --> 00:51:55,834
And we will.

769
00:52:05,866 --> 00:52:08,235
Julian was my brother, man.

770
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:12,335
I know he was, son.

771
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,668
I mean, he's--

772
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:20,569
he's the only family I have left.

773
00:52:25,232 --> 00:52:29,636
I mean, Jason can't just
walk the fucking streets

774
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:31,300
and Julian's--

775
00:52:31,366 --> 00:52:33,735
Listen.
Listen to me, Bobby.

776
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:35,667
You can end this.

777
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:38,600
We gotta to do this the right way.

778
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,534
If you're gonna get
emotional on me,

779
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,667
I gotta yank you out of
this right now.

780
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:44,601
I don't want Julian's death
to be in vain

781
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,768
any fucking more than you do.
I don't want that,

782
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,635
but we need to get this guy Jason
on federal charges--

783
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,901
drug trafficking,
organized crime,

784
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:54,034
multiple murder convictions.

785
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:56,401
You want this motherfucker to go away
and never see the light of day?

786
00:52:56,466 --> 00:52:58,768
Is that what you want?
This is the way you do it.

787
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,735
But you gotta look at me
and tell me you're capable.

788
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:05,401
Look, I promise you something:

789
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:07,901
if we don't pin anything on him...

790
00:53:10,165 --> 00:53:12,267
I will fucking end this.

791
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:34,002
Aim, fire!

792
00:53:34,065 --> 00:53:35,800
Aim,

793
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:37,267
fire!

794
00:53:37,332 --> 00:53:39,000
Aim, fire!

795
00:53:39,065 --> 00:53:40,766
Recover!

796
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,134
Let's go.

797
00:57:29,399 --> 00:57:31,100
I'm so--

798
01:00:13,766 --> 01:00:15,701
Hello, Mr. Ramirez.

799
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:17,801
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you.

800
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:19,667
We've been expecting you.

801
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:21,734
Please, this way.

802
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:27,068
Well, it's about
a 20-minute drive to your hotel.

803
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:29,300
I'm sure they will be
serving dinner by then.

804
01:00:29,366 --> 01:00:32,602
Maybe you and your friend
would like to go out.

805
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:34,367
There is a very--
how do you say?

806
01:00:34,432 --> 01:00:36,967
--crazy nightlife here in our city.

807
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:38,133
Friend?

808
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:41,869
Yes, a gentleman
by the name of Derek.

809
01:00:54,366 --> 01:00:58,503
My eyes

810
01:00:58,566 --> 01:01:03,037
Follow you around the room

811
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:08,068
And I

812
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,867
Only ever look

813
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:15,469
At you

814
01:01:15,532 --> 01:01:19,168
The way you move

815
01:01:20,866 --> 01:01:25,070
Get a feeling I can't hide

816
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:30,303
It's up to you

817
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:33,868
If we're gonna do this

818
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:37,503
Tonight...

819
01:02:58,532 --> 01:03:01,534
What the fuck are you doing,
pendejo?

820
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,368
Pinche seamstress or what?

821
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:06,734
Can you bring in my dress?

822
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,567
I'm losing weight.

823
01:03:13,132 --> 01:03:15,067
Hey.

824
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:17,067
Hey, Derek.

825
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:20,201
Look at me, shithead.

826
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:22,166
Just get out, Mom.
You're drunk.

827
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,867
Why are you always sewing

828
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:31,468
that Cavaricci shit on your pants

829
01:03:31,532 --> 01:03:35,669
and those ducks from my
purse on your shoes?

830
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:38,335
Maybe if we weren't so poor,
I wouldn't have to.

831
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,834
Hey, I work hard for this family.

832
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:43,534
You show me some respect.

833
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,334
On your back.

834
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:21,902
Fucking shit!
I fucking hate this!

835
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:16,333
Who the fuck are you?

836
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:20,234
Look, I don't got time
for this shit, all right?

837
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:22,434
I got a delivery from Nadie.

838
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:25,534
What happened to Derek?

839
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,534
I don't know.

840
01:05:28,566 --> 01:05:29,967
So are you gonna let me in?

841
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:34,101
I look kind of stupid sitting
out here with a fucking duffel bag.

842
01:05:49,132 --> 01:05:51,234
So why'd they send you?
What happened to Derek?

843
01:05:52,733 --> 01:05:55,402
Yeah, it's like I said,
I don't know.

844
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:58,202
Probably found a nice
piece of ass down in Mexico,

845
01:05:58,265 --> 01:06:00,734
missed his flight back, you know?

846
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,468
A nice piece of ass, huh?

847
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:05,567
Yeah, well
you know Derek,' right?

848
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:07,633
Yeah.

849
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:09,333
I gotta make a call.

850
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:11,267
Why don't you grab a beer?
I'll just finish this in a bit.

851
01:06:11,332 --> 01:06:12,833
You know, it's cool.
I'm gonna go and--

852
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:16,369
Like I said, have a beer.
Nico, get this dude a beer.

853
01:06:37,399 --> 01:06:39,167
He's here.

854
01:06:39,232 --> 01:06:41,500
Yeah. Yeah, he brought it.

855
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:51,335
So how long have you been
working with Nadie?

856
01:06:51,399 --> 01:06:53,534
Shit, I've known him my whole life.

857
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,567
Huh.

858
01:06:58,232 --> 01:06:59,933
Funny, I've never met you before.

859
01:07:02,299 --> 01:07:04,434
Yeah, it's funny.

860
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:06,500
No, bro.

861
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:08,167
Sit down.
Take it easy.

862
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:11,034
It's gonna be a minute.
You're gonna do a few bumps, right?

863
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:12,533
Uh, you know what?

864
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,300
I had a late night last night.
I'm cool.

865
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:16,334
Two it is.

866
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:22,035
So how long have you been
working with Nadie?

867
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:25,368
Shit, hell of a lot longer than you.

868
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:33,367
I told you I was cool, man.

869
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:36,334
I think you need a little pick-me-up.

870
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:38,367
Come on, just one line.

871
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,134
What's the problem?

872
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,668
Why don't you tell your boy
over here to back the fuck off?

873
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:56,668
Hey, calm down, Bobby.
No need to get out of hand.

874
01:07:56,733 --> 01:07:58,734
Bobby, huh?

875
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:01,900
I never told you my name.

876
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:47,601
Like this, huh?

877
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:54,035
No, not like this.

878
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,501
Son of a bitch.

879
01:09:45,866 --> 01:09:46,833
Fuck.

880
01:09:53,532 --> 01:09:55,333
Fuck!

881
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,569
Motherfucker's got a boney face.

882
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,700
What the fuck are you doing?

883
01:10:01,766 --> 01:10:04,702
Huh? Fucking reading comics?

884
01:10:08,799 --> 01:10:10,167
Give me the picture.

885
01:10:10,232 --> 01:10:12,167
Give me the fucking phone.

886
01:10:12,232 --> 01:10:13,600
Come on.

887
01:10:21,466 --> 01:10:23,234
Will you come pick this up?

888
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:27,569
Hey, shithead,
come pick this shit up.

889
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:32,000
I swear to God, man,

890
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:34,000
if my sister wasn't having
your fucking baby, man,

891
01:10:34,065 --> 01:10:36,233
I would kill you right now,
you know that?

892
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:39,402
Oh, yeah, I'd stab you
with my fucking gun, man.

893
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:41,634
You'd stab me with your fucking gun?
That makes sense.

894
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:42,733
- That's good.
- Yes, stab you with my--

895
01:10:42,799 --> 01:10:44,367
shut the fuck up, man.

896
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:46,233
Fucking kill you.

897
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:53,034
How could you do this, man?

898
01:10:53,099 --> 01:10:55,301
You sadistic fuck. Huh?

899
01:10:55,366 --> 01:10:58,035
You're a sick motherfucker, man.
You know that?

900
01:10:58,099 --> 01:11:00,334
Right?

901
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:03,001
Huh? You're sick.

902
01:11:04,499 --> 01:11:08,135
How am I supposed
to make you look like this, huh?

903
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:17,635
Hey, get off your fucking ass, man.

904
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:19,167
It's your shot.

905
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:21,667
Let's go.

906
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,302
Fuck.

907
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:30,534
Fuck.

908
01:11:30,599 --> 01:11:33,601
What did you get
yourself into, huh?

909
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,568
Do you think we enjoy this?

910
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:40,501
I'm a cop, okay?

911
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:43,669
This hurts me
more than it hurts you.

912
01:11:49,366 --> 01:11:52,001
Actually,
maybe it hurts you more.

913
01:11:58,632 --> 01:11:59,766
What are you doing?

914
01:12:02,232 --> 01:12:04,200
Pick him up.

915
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:07,434
Pick him up.

916
01:12:30,366 --> 01:12:31,800
You know, I...

917
01:12:33,032 --> 01:12:35,634
I should kill you right now.

918
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,667
You know?

919
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:40,969
I should fucking kill
you right now.

920
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:43,934
No one would care.

921
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,335
No one would cry.

922
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:49,769
And no one would ever
even miss you.

923
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,869
But I-- I can't.

924
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:01,701
I can't.

925
01:13:01,766 --> 01:13:04,835
Why-- why can't I?
Why the fuck can't I?

926
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,734
I don't-- I don't--
I mean, I don't care.

927
01:13:12,299 --> 01:13:15,068
I don't care.
I don't-- I don't--

928
01:13:15,132 --> 01:13:18,168
it's not gonna make me sad.

929
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:21,768
Maybe--
maybe it's because--

930
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:24,302
maybe it's 'cause I want to know--

931
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,668
I want to know some things.

932
01:13:36,466 --> 01:13:38,701
Remember that time we held up

933
01:13:38,766 --> 01:13:41,735
that taqueria on-- on Mission?

934
01:13:43,165 --> 01:13:45,233
Remember that?

935
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:48,534
You and Julian

936
01:13:48,599 --> 01:13:51,902
were so fucking scared.

937
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:53,901
You guys were always

938
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:56,335
a bunch of little fucking bitches.

939
01:14:01,866 --> 01:14:04,969
And that-- that got me thinking.

940
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:09,802
What makes a better cop...

941
01:14:12,332 --> 01:14:14,634
than, you know,

942
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,667
a little bitch with a gun?

943
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:21,267
You know, I had to go
back to that place

944
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,600
and clean up that mess
all by myself.

945
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:30,802
True story.
I wouldn't lie about that shit.

946
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,168
I would not lie about that shit.

947
01:14:33,232 --> 01:14:35,334
That shit was scary as fuck.

948
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:40,003
I was scared.
That shit was horrible.

949
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:45,068
I'm only gonna ask you once.

950
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:54,400
Are you-- are you--

951
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:58,401
are you a cop?

952
01:14:58,466 --> 01:15:01,101
He doesn't have
the huevos to be a cop.

953
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:10,236
Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.

954
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,603
You-- I mean, you really really
fucked up Derek, man.

955
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:22,703
I mean,
he is hurt pretty fucking bad.

956
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:27,203
Why, man? Huh?

957
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:31,867
He grabbed my dick, bro.

958
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:39,768
He grabbed your dick.

959
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:41,901
Oh shit, that's...

960
01:15:43,432 --> 01:15:45,901
that's funny.

961
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:48,335
That's fucking funny.

962
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,734
You want to know
what else is funny?

963
01:15:55,766 --> 01:15:57,567
Yo!

964
01:16:05,599 --> 01:16:06,766
Derek, I--

965
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:14,401
You wore a mask
to cover up your pretty little face,

966
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:17,635
but I saw your eyes, my friend.

967
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:20,068
I'll never forget these eyes.

968
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:25,634
Let me ask you something:

969
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:28,134
Is the pain you
inflicted on my face

970
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:30,134
still on your hands?

971
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,500
Huh?

972
01:16:31,566 --> 01:16:34,568
Answer me,
you piece of shit!

973
01:16:50,366 --> 01:16:52,701
Why did you do it, man?

974
01:16:54,132 --> 01:16:55,233
Hmm?

975
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:57,467
Once you found out
Julian was a narc,

976
01:16:57,532 --> 01:16:59,700
you should have been happy
he was gone.

977
01:17:01,733 --> 01:17:04,569
Now I hate to admit it,
bro, but I--

978
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:07,701
I really really really
really loved Julian.

979
01:17:08,766 --> 01:17:10,767
I did. I did.

980
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:14,269
But, I mean, I had
no other options, really.

981
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:22,001
I mean, this--
this dumb shit right here--

982
01:17:22,065 --> 01:17:24,000
I could care less
what the fuck you do to him.

983
01:17:24,065 --> 01:17:25,833
I mean, shit, man, if you knew

984
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:27,300
how much trouble he caused me, you--

985
01:17:28,366 --> 01:17:30,334
I-- I should thank you
for disciplining

986
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:31,900
this motherfucker.
I should.

987
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,900
Thank you. Thank you.

988
01:17:36,766 --> 01:17:40,102
I want-- I want to know, Bobby.

989
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,601
I want to know.

990
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:47,068
- Just fucking shoot him al--
- Would you shut the fuck up?

991
01:17:47,132 --> 01:17:49,000
Get the fuck out of here.

992
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:50,833
Rodriguez, get this
motherfucker in his car.

993
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,034
- I'm just saying.
- What about Derek?

994
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:55,501
Leave this fucking cripple
here with me.

995
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:57,000
All right, man.
I'm sorry, man.

996
01:17:57,065 --> 01:17:59,200
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

997
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:02,534
Damn it.

998
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:06,599
Fuck.

999
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:13,168
I need you to tell me, Bobby.

1000
01:18:13,232 --> 01:18:16,234
I won't be mad.

1001
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:22,569
How well do you really
know somebody, Jason?

1002
01:18:22,632 --> 01:18:25,968
What? What?

1003
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:28,868
Be-- be-- be clear, motherfucker.

1004
01:18:28,933 --> 01:18:32,069
- How well do you really know somebody?
- What?

1005
01:18:32,132 --> 01:18:34,067
What?

1006
01:18:34,132 --> 01:18:36,267
I'm a narc.

1007
01:18:36,332 --> 01:18:39,334
I'm a motherfucking federal agent,
you dumbass.

1008
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:42,468
I did something with my life.

1009
01:18:42,532 --> 01:18:45,468
And you-- all you did was hurt

1010
01:18:45,532 --> 01:18:47,867
and steal and take.

1011
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:50,201
You make me fucking sick.
You know that?

1012
01:18:50,265 --> 01:18:53,267
Wow wow wow
wow wow.

1013
01:18:53,332 --> 01:18:56,101
Oh, shit, man, I--

1014
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:02,567
I was just trying to scare you

1015
01:19:02,632 --> 01:19:05,668
for getting Derek
and fucking my chick, but--

1016
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:07,134
but--

1017
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:13,401
I don't even really know
what's fucking going on.

1018
01:19:13,466 --> 01:19:16,035
What the fuck?

1019
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:18,468
Oh, fuck.

1020
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:33,502
Derek, have at him.

1021
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:37,403
Come on,
fucking have at him.

1022
01:19:37,466 --> 01:19:39,267
Come on.

1023
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:43,501
Oh, fuck.

1024
01:19:43,566 --> 01:19:45,067
Fuck.

1025
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:53,568
What's taking you so long,
dumbass? Come on.

1026
01:19:53,632 --> 01:19:56,267
What's taking you so fucking long?

1027
01:19:56,332 --> 01:19:58,500
Hey.

1028
01:19:58,566 --> 01:20:02,770
Hey, pull the fucking trigger!

1029
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:05,168
Oh, you're fucking useless, man.

1030
01:20:05,232 --> 01:20:07,500
Oh, you are fucking useless.

1031
01:20:07,566 --> 01:20:09,334
- I'm useless?
- Yeah, you're fucking--

1032
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:10,967
- I'm useless?
- Yeah.

1033
01:20:11,032 --> 01:20:12,299
- No, fuck you!
- Whoa whoa.

1034
01:20:12,366 --> 01:20:13,967
- Fuck you, man!
- Whoa whoa.

1035
01:20:14,032 --> 01:20:16,200
- Fuck you, Jason!
- Whoa whoa whoa. Hey hey hey.

1036
01:20:16,265 --> 01:20:18,400
Hey, back the fuck up, man!
Back the--

1037
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:20,734
- Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
- You know what?

1038
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:22,967
My whole fucking life
all you've ever done

1039
01:20:23,032 --> 01:20:25,067
is tell me
how stupid I am.

1040
01:20:25,132 --> 01:20:27,167
Guess what:
I'm not stupid, Jason.

1041
01:20:27,232 --> 01:20:28,866
No. I'm sorry, Nadie, right?

1042
01:20:28,933 --> 01:20:30,868
That's what you like
to be called, right? Nadie?

1043
01:20:30,933 --> 01:20:33,602
What kind of stupid-ass name
is that anyway, huh?

1044
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:35,734
Shit, if anyone should be
called Nadie, it's me.

1045
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:38,368
Because I'm always
treated like no one!

1046
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:39,866
I got a brain.

1047
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:42,468
I can think.
I know how shit's run, man.

1048
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:44,767
I know how it's run.
I've been running it.

1049
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,501
I don't need you.

1050
01:20:46,566 --> 01:20:48,067
- Hey, hey, hey, man!
- I can do this without you.

1051
01:20:48,132 --> 01:20:50,067
Shut the fuck up!

1052
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:57,536
Oh. Oh, fuck.

1053
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:01,336
My life's gonna be
a whole lot happier being a boss.

1054
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:04,435
Fuck!

1055
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:06,834
Hey, please.
Please, man.

1056
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:08,967
I will make it
all right, man.

1057
01:21:09,032 --> 01:21:11,701
Hey, please.

1058
01:21:16,466 --> 01:21:19,068
Please stop talking.

1059
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:21,133
Fuck!

1060
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,167
Just let me finish.

1061
01:21:26,265 --> 01:21:28,033
It's about time.

1062
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:34,402
No no no no no no no!

1063
01:21:34,466 --> 01:21:37,402
Damn it.

1064
01:21:37,466 --> 01:21:39,601
He said stay in the fucking car!

1065
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:42,035
Derek, Derek.

1066
01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:44,067
Shit.

1067
01:21:47,065 --> 01:21:49,534
Derek, Derek, please.

1068
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:51,400
Please, man, Derek.

1069
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:13,667
Shit.

1070
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,200
Derek.

1071
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:43,235
Derek.

1072
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:52,701
You gotta un-cuff me, man.

1073
01:22:57,799 --> 01:22:59,767
Bobby.

1074
01:23:01,599 --> 01:23:03,867
You remember that time that we ate

1075
01:23:03,933 --> 01:23:05,934
at that joint off of Mission, right?

1076
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,969
The one--
the one that Jason wanted to rob?

1077
01:23:09,032 --> 01:23:11,401
You remember that, right?

1078
01:23:11,466 --> 01:23:14,001
I do.

1079
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:17,567
I think about it a lot.

1080
01:23:19,632 --> 01:23:22,201
I think about it a lot.

1081
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:24,900
And I remember-- ow.

1082
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,602
I remember how you and Julian--

1083
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:31,001
you guys didn't want to do anything.

1084
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:36,034
And me-- I--

1085
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:37,700
I just wanted
to fit in.

1086
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:44,203
I mean, I was never
the cool guy, you know?

1087
01:23:44,265 --> 01:23:47,534
I-- I never had the nice shoes.

1088
01:23:47,599 --> 01:23:49,767
I never had money.

1089
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,769
I just wanted to feel important, man.

1090
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,368
Fuck important.

1091
01:23:58,432 --> 01:24:00,600
I just wanted to be accepted.

1092
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:07,236
You-- I mean, you had Julian,
you know?

1093
01:24:07,299 --> 01:24:10,168
And Jason--
he never needed nobody.

1094
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:15,533
But me--

1095
01:24:15,599 --> 01:24:16,800
Me--

1096
01:24:20,065 --> 01:24:22,033
I did.

1097
01:24:26,466 --> 01:24:28,434
I did.

1098
01:24:28,499 --> 01:24:31,068
Where was
my best buddy, huh?

1099
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,401
Where was my best buddy?

1100
01:24:39,933 --> 01:24:42,235
And now shit's all fucked up, man.

1101
01:24:42,299 --> 01:24:45,769
Shit's-- shit's all fucked up.

1102
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:52,602
And I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

1103
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:58,101
I don't know what to do.

1104
01:25:22,499 --> 01:25:25,702
You guys were right, man.

1105
01:25:25,766 --> 01:25:27,501
You guys were so right.

1106
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:32,101
That poor girl, man--

1107
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:38,968
she haunts my dreams.

1108
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:43,835
And that cook-- that cook--

1109
01:25:43,899 --> 01:25:46,067
he didn't have to die.

1110
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:49,467
He wasn't gonna
tell nobody.

1111
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:51,700
He was an illegal.

1112
01:25:51,766 --> 01:25:54,602
She haunts
my dreams too, bro.

1113
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,000
Yeah?

1114
01:25:58,566 --> 01:26:00,734
I mean, that's the reason
that Julian and I--

1115
01:26:00,799 --> 01:26:03,434
you know, the reason we went
and took the road that we took.

1116
01:26:07,032 --> 01:26:09,267
But you have to know

1117
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:12,234
that one day doesn't define a man.

1118
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:16,434
Right?

1119
01:26:18,432 --> 01:26:21,034
You have to un-cuff me,
bro. Come on.

1120
01:26:45,432 --> 01:26:49,235
Man, I appreciate you, Bobby,

1121
01:26:49,299 --> 01:26:52,068
I really do.

1122
01:26:54,232 --> 01:26:56,934
Jason--

1123
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,802
he never really cared about me.

1124
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:05,435
He just wanted
to treat me like an ass.

1125
01:27:05,499 --> 01:27:06,766
Oh, shit.

1126
01:27:09,132 --> 01:27:10,933
Sorry.

1127
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,035
He's sensitive.

1128
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,204
But you and I
both know, man,

1129
01:27:29,265 --> 01:27:30,966
as soon as we
walk out of here,

1130
01:27:31,032 --> 01:27:33,434
I'm gonna be popped
with all kinds of shit.

1131
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:36,602
No. No.

1132
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:39,902
Yeah, come on.

1133
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:42,201
Look, you don't have
to do this, Derek.

1134
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,035
I'm gonna miss you, bro.

1135
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:56,067
Dios.

1136
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,435
Bobby.

1137
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:25,601
- I'm so sorry.
- Take the handcuffs off, please.

1138
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:26,867
I'm sorry.

1139
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:30,935
You gotta believe me.
I'm not like this.

1140
01:28:35,933 --> 01:28:37,801
I just knew this would happen.

1141
01:28:37,866 --> 01:28:39,634
Jason was just too crazy.

1142
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:42,401
And then when I got home,
I found this note.

1143
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:46,500
What note?

1144
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:52,235
He thought I was
leaving him for you.

1145
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:57,702
I'm just-- I'm glad
I overheard him talking the other night.

1146
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:02,034
I'm so sorry, Bobby.
I'm so sorry.

1147
01:29:04,265 --> 01:29:06,233
I'm sorry.

1148
01:29:13,165 --> 01:29:14,766
- You have to go.
- No.

1149
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,267
Yeah, you have to go.

1150
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,867
- Go. It's okay.
- No.

1151
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:20,934
Go. It's okay.

1152
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:05,766
Bobby?

1153
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,534
Bobby?

1154
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:25,033
Are you okay?

1155
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:31,900
Is everyone here accounted for?

1156
01:30:31,966 --> 01:30:33,934
Yeah.

1157
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,934
The captain put a tracker on you
when you were a no-show.

1158
01:30:43,866 --> 01:30:45,834
I guess you owe him one.

1159
01:30:53,733 --> 01:30:55,868
Can I get some help over here?

1160
01:31:07,733 --> 01:31:10,102
Let's clear it.

1161
01:32:07,966 --> 01:32:11,202
I remember when my father
used to take me to play catch.

1162
01:32:14,132 --> 01:32:16,534
He used to keep me out
till the sun went down,

1163
01:32:16,599 --> 01:32:18,834
take me home, make me wash up

1164
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:21,434
and then go straight to bed.

1165
01:32:21,499 --> 01:32:23,834
I wish every father
would go that far

1166
01:32:23,899 --> 01:32:27,035
just to make sure their kids didn't
make the same mistakes they did.

1167
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:57,668
Julian used to get on my case
about my attitude.

1168
01:32:57,733 --> 01:32:59,668
He told me I should be happy

1169
01:32:59,733 --> 01:33:03,002
for all the things
God had given me.

1170
01:33:03,065 --> 01:33:05,033
Now I know he was right.

1171
01:33:08,566 --> 01:33:10,834
I was lucky to have a brother
like him.

1172
01:33:27,566 --> 01:33:29,868
Happy birthday, bro.

1173
01:34:23,733 --> 01:34:24,934
A great man once told me

1174
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,168
that one day doesn't define a person.

1175
01:34:28,499 --> 01:34:30,500
He was right.

1176
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:35,069
We all have the ability
to create our own legacy.

1177
01:35:34,499 --> 01:35:36,100
What's up, Cap?

1178
01:35:36,165 --> 01:35:39,101
Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

1179
01:35:39,165 --> 01:35:41,367
What's going on?

1180
01:35:41,432 --> 01:35:44,268
You were pretty tight
with Jason's crew, right?

1181
01:35:44,332 --> 01:35:46,100
Yeah.
What do you need to know?

1182
01:35:46,165 --> 01:35:47,933
Anybody you can think of
that would be capable

1183
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,001
of taking over that operation?

1184
01:35:52,899 --> 01:35:55,301
Why are you asking?

1185
01:35:58,065 --> 01:36:00,734
Nadie was just a name,
Bobby.

1186
01:36:03,532 --> 01:36:05,567
And somebody's still using it.

1187
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:24,134
Oh, oh, oh

1188
01:37:24,199 --> 01:37:26,200
I used to be on the block all day

1189
01:37:26,265 --> 01:37:29,301
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

1190
01:37:29,366 --> 01:37:31,601
I flip that, did hits and I'm on

1191
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:34,235
They still want to lock me up, oh

1192
01:37:34,299 --> 01:37:37,168
They want to give me life

1193
01:37:37,232 --> 01:37:39,467
Oh, oh, oh

1194
01:37:39,532 --> 01:37:42,601
They want to give me life

1195
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:45,735
- All right, yeah
- They want to give me life

1196
01:37:45,799 --> 01:37:48,301
All right, I wear the shoe
if the shoe fits

1197
01:37:48,366 --> 01:37:51,202
'Cause we was born
with ambitions of being rich

1198
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:54,134
We was born with ambitions
of hitting licks

1199
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:56,768
My mama said it'd
be days like this now

1200
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:59,335
This here was Bugsy shit,
that real Bugsy shit

1201
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:01,968
Oh, yeah, we copyright,
them niggas counterfeit

1202
01:38:02,032 --> 01:38:04,667
See, them niggas just
ballin' in they daydreams

1203
01:38:04,733 --> 01:38:07,802
Me and Norm finna go
and cop the Saleen

1204
01:38:07,866 --> 01:38:10,501
Team Hometown
cruising down the interstate

1205
01:38:10,566 --> 01:38:12,968
We was optimistic,
now we out the gate

1206
01:38:13,032 --> 01:38:15,634
Where the critics at?
They had a lot to say

1207
01:38:15,699 --> 01:38:18,268
I guess these niggas mad,
old and out of date

1208
01:38:18,332 --> 01:38:21,268
See, me, I'm like Hov,
I don't write shit

1209
01:38:21,332 --> 01:38:23,934
Took my dogs
to Hollywood, Mike Vick

1210
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,502
You riding the shit,
if you riding it right

1211
01:38:26,566 --> 01:38:29,535
If you riding with us,
then you riding for life

1212
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:31,767
I used to be on the
block all day

1213
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,869
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

1214
01:38:34,933 --> 01:38:37,168
I flip that,
did hits and I'm on

1215
01:38:37,232 --> 01:38:39,801
They still want to
lock me up, oh

1216
01:38:39,866 --> 01:38:42,735
They want to give me life

1217
01:38:42,799 --> 01:38:45,034
Oh, oh, oh

1218
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:48,168
They want to give me life

1219
01:38:48,232 --> 01:38:49,466
Oh, oh, oh

1220
01:38:49,532 --> 01:38:51,300
They want to give me life

1221
01:38:51,366 --> 01:38:53,968
All right, I wear the
crown if the crown fit

1222
01:38:54,032 --> 01:38:56,334
But all kings get killed,
so I don't wear it much

1223
01:38:56,399 --> 01:38:59,335
I hit the stage,
city to city, and tear it up

1224
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:01,934
Straight raw lyrics,
I put my heart in it

1225
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,002
But nowadays they don't like it
when you spit the truth

1226
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:07,333
They want that bubblegum shit
that they're used to

1227
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:10,068
See, these niggas in the game
for the wrong reason

1228
01:39:10,132 --> 01:39:13,001
Sitting on the bench
for the whole season

1229
01:39:13,065 --> 01:39:15,500
Team Hometown
cruising down the interstate

1230
01:39:15,566 --> 01:39:18,435
We was optimistic,
now we out the gate

1231
01:39:18,499 --> 01:39:21,101
The powers that be,
I see, was trying to hate

1232
01:39:21,165 --> 01:39:23,734
But Bugsy always on time,
never late

1233
01:39:23,799 --> 01:39:26,501
I'm riding with it,
these other niggas just ride around

1234
01:39:26,566 --> 01:39:29,135
Never leave evidence,
never write it down

1235
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,101
If you riding this shit,
if you riding it right

1236
01:39:32,165 --> 01:39:34,600
If you riding with us,
then you riding for life

1237
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:37,001
I used to be on the block all day

1238
01:39:37,065 --> 01:39:40,101
Getting money
till the sun comes up, oh

1239
01:39:40,165 --> 01:39:42,400
I flip that, did hits and I'm on

1240
01:39:42,466 --> 01:39:45,035
They still want to lock me up, oh

1241
01:39:45,099 --> 01:39:47,968
They want to give me life

1242
01:39:48,032 --> 01:39:50,267
Oh, oh, oh

1243
01:39:50,332 --> 01:39:53,401
They want to give me life

1244
01:39:53,466 --> 01:39:54,900
Oh, oh, oh

1245
01:39:54,966 --> 01:39:57,768
They want to give me life.
