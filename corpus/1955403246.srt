Yeah, well, anyway,

00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,410
it's pretty much how we pay
our bills every year,

63
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,712
but there was an emergency

64
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,146
so my mom had to go
out of town for the week,

65
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,549
so there's no way I could
put all these decorations up

00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,850
by myself for Halloween.

67
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,453

to do your dirty work?

I kinda sorta
didn't invite her, you know?

00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,211
I mean, I love her to death,

93
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,648
but she doesn't exactly
like to get her hands dirty,

94
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,550
so I figured we'd get
more done without her.

95
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,518
You know she's gonna
go bat shit on your ass

96
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,819

97
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,921

on all our asses.

are straight,

if we get it done,

101
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,795
then I won't say a peep,
but if we don't, who knows?

we'd help.

I love having
you guys over.

It's kind of hard

Why do you say that?

Well,
i love her to death,

been gone,

164

she's a little weird.

one of these people

i guess.

00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,357
Kind of creeps me out.

181
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,393
To each her own, I guess.

182
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,129
Come on.

183
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,732
Those bitches are starting
the party without us.

184
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,435
Okay.
I'll be right there.

185
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,703
[***]

186
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,472
[Woman inhaling, coughing]

187
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:48,675
And things got pretty heated
between me and the slut.

188
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,411
I mean, she was
all up in my face

189
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,579
arguing with me big time,

190
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,115
like she was ready
to throw down on my ass.

191
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,985
Finally, I just had to
sit her down and say,

192
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,821
"look, dude,
the cotangent is x over y

193
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:05,225
if the corners of the right
triangle are bac. You dig?"

194
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,293
Imagine.

195
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,996
Girl trying to
school me on trig.

196
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,263
I would've slapped her

197
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,032
if I didn't think
I'd break a nail.

198
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:16,804
Shit. Girl didn't know she was
messin' with a math whiz.

199
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,171
Oh, hell.
[Coughing]

200
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,341
I can't even figure out
a tip at a restaurant.

201
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,610
Like you ever have to
pay for your own dinner.

202
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,378
Truth.

203
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,414
Somebody say, "hey!"

204
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,182
All:
Hey!

205
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,518
Diets are to be
ignored tonight, ladies.

206
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,086
Diet? Who diets?

207
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,488
A body like that
and she doesn't diet?

208
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,024
I hate you.

209
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,827
Come on, guys.
Let's get started.

210
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,131
Oh, yes. Gin.

Ew!

213
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,159
It's not gross
from where I'm standing.

214
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,460
Ew!

215
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,428

Hey, you guys.

217
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,533
Come check this out.

218
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,135
What is it?

219
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,637
Jen:
I don't know.
It might not even work.

220
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,706
What?
One moment.

221
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,109
[All screaming]

222
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:33,280
Oh, my God!
Bitch!

223
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,414
You suck.

[Laughing]

225
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,718
I guess it still works.

226
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,752
Holy shit.
I guess so.

227
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,621
That is awesome.
Oh, my God.

228
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,256
[Laughing]

229
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,058
That was not cool.
It wasn't that scary.

230
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,793
Come on.
Okay.

231
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,128

Ooh, check this one out. Wicked.

234
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,315
Oh, new additions
to the haunted house.

235
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,118
I haven't even
seen these yet.

236
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,920
Ooh, these are
gonna scare the crap

237
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,154
out of the little kids.

238
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,656
Not just the kids. Barf.

239
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,425
What's the matter,
honey?

240
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,759
Too scary for you?

241
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,394
More like too silly.

242
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,763
Who would be afraid
of this stuff?

243
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,532
Ah!
[Gasps]

00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,767

245
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,270
That's not funny.

246
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,207
Silly, huh?
You seemed pretty scared to me.

247
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,510
Okay, I admit it.
I was a little scared.

248
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,379
Good one, kianna.

Thank you.

Scary, right?

[Laughing]

256
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,228
That's awesome.
That's enough.

257
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,130
That one's good too.
Pretty scary, right?

258
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,431
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,033
Twice in one day.
All right, you guys,

260
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,502
let's get back to work.

261
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,071
By the way, Jen,
don't you think

262
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,738
this crystal ball
would look perfect

263
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,207
in the center
of the room?

264
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,510
Whoa, whoa! That's my mom's
crystal ball. Be careful.

265
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,512
Well, don't you think
it's hidden here?

266
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,747
Honestly, I think we should
just leave it where it is,

267
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,217
because it's not even
part of the haunted house

268
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,352
and she'd freak out
if she knew we were touching it.

269
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,753
Catalina:
What do you mean?

270
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,990
It's perfect for
the centerpiece of the room.

271
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,157
It's beautiful.

272
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,326
Cat, you wouldn't
know beautiful balls

273
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,996
if they slapped you
on the ass.

274
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,497
You're right.

275
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,333
I gave up balls
a long time ago.

276
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,137
But I do love huge,
heaving orbs.

277
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,173
[***]

278
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,710
Seriously, guys?

279
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,512
She loves that thing
more than anything.

280
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,614
Like, she talks to it
all day long.

281
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,382
Full-on conversations.

282
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,883
To be honest, it kind of
freaks me out.

283
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,154
Like, I feel like it's
watching my every move.

284
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,356
[Phone rings]

285
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,261
Oh, my God! You guys,
it's my mom.

286
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,996
Ugh.

287
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,166
[Phone beeps]

288
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,934
Hi, mom.
Mother: Hi, honey.

289
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,502
How's everything
going there?

290
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,139
Fine, but the question is, "how
are things there?"

291
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,806
Oh, you know.
It's coming along.

292
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,643
They need to be.
We open a week from tonight.

293
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,578
I know, mom.
Everything will be ready.

294
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,314
It better. And I don't want
any boys there while I'm away.

295
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,383
It'll just distract you
from your duties.

296
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,817
Okay, got it. No boys.

297
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,686
And that goes double
for your girlfriends.

298
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,522
They're worse. Especially that
catatonia.

299
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,792
Mom, it's catalina,
not catatonia.

300
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,061
What was that?

301
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,928
What was what?
I heard laughter.

302
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,064
Is somebody there with you?

303
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,831
No, mom. Not... nobody's here.

304
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,734
You listen to me, missy.
Nobody better be.

305
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,036
I'll find out, you know.

306
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,305
I have eyes and ears
in that house.

307
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,307
Jen:
I know, mom.
Nothing escapes the wicked,

308
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,042
wondrous gaze
of the crystal ball.

309
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,510
You've got that right,
young lady.

310
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,145
The crystal ball
tells it all.

311
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,346
You didn't touch it,
did you?

312
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,847
No, of course not.

313
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,549
It's probably lonely
without me.

314
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,718
I'll take good care of it,
mom, I promise.

315
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,388
You just stay away from it.
I have to get going.

316
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,356
Your aunt will be out
of the hospital today.

317
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,624
Okay, well, stop fussing.

318
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,493
I promise everything
will be ready, okay?

319
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,662
It better be.
And remember, I'll find out.

320
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,565
Okay. Love you too. Bye.

321
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,966
See, you guys?
I told you.

322
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,069
She loves that thing
way too much.

323
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,970
I don't know.

324
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,539
I think it's kinda cute.

325
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,475
Maybe you just gotta
get to know it better.

326
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,580
[Deep laughter]

327
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,490
Hey, if you break that,
i am in deep crap.

328
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,393
Catalina:
Yeah, boobs!

329
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,399
Whatever, you guys.

330
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,034
Hey, what is this?

331
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,736
Open it.

332
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,174
Ugh.

333
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,111
You have such
beautiful eye.

334
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,547
That thing
is really gross.

335
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,150
Hey, we could put it
right here on the pedestal.

336
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,017
Catalina: Yeah.
Keep watch over us.

337
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,621
Uh-huh. Oh, hang on.

338
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,089
Oh, it's a DVD
of the movie.

339
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,391
What movie?

340
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,460
The killer eye, durr.

341
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,362
They made a movie
out of that thing?

342
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,996
They make movies
out of everything.

343
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,998
I saw one once
where this evil bong

344
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,568
sucked people inside of it when
you smoked out of it.

345
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,002
What was inside?

346
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,237
Naked bitches.

347
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,972
So hot.

348
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,774
That's my kind of
horror movie.

349
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,709
I love those movies.

350
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,778
Hey, I think we can
call it a night, right?

351
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,614
Maybe we should just stop
decorating for a while

352
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,283
and watch it.

353
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,019
It's not exactly
a chick flick.

354
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,654
It's more like
a dick flick.

355
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,556
Come on.
Don't be bitches, bitches.

356
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,292
It's probably like,

00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:14,792
I mean, since we might be
getting blown to bits and all.

895
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:17,394
I haven't been the most
faithful wife in the world.

896
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:18,929
I know.

897
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:21,532
And, you know, you haven't been
the most loving husband.

898
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:23,668
I know that too.

899
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:24,935
And I was... I was thinking

900
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,905
maybe we should get a divorce.

901
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,078
Wow!

902
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:37,081
That good for you?
Real good!

903
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,884
[***]

904
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,655
[Moaning]

905
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:48,358
Oh, it's never
been like this.

906
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,094
Mmm.

907
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:53,798
Mmm.

908
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,472
Oh, God!

909
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,941
Don't be afraid, Rita.

910
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,043
It's not an evil being.

911
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,578
It let me look
into its mind.

912
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,013
What'd it just do to me?

913
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:13,117
It had certain needs,
and it asked me to help it,

914
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,753
and in exchange,
it's gonna help me.

915
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:17,387
And so I did it.

916
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,823
I did it, Rita.

917
00:59:18,823 --> 00:59:20,891
It's gonna show me
how to open up a real portal

918
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,460
to the eighth dimension.

919
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,995
I mean, isn't this great?

920
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:27,564
A whole world full of these
little guys everywhere you look?

921
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,999
What are you
talking about?

922
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:32,937
This eye.
It's not here by accident.

923
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,184
Rocky?

924
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,756
Rocky?

925
00:59:57,194 --> 00:59:59,096
Rocky?

926
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,966
We're leaving.

927
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:09,106
It doesn't want us
to leave, Jenna.

928
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:11,642
Put that down.

929
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:12,910
Not on your life.

930
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,081
I said, "put it down."

931
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,516
Hey!

932
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:22,252
Get off of me! Stop it.

933
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,354
Don't fight it, Jenna.

934
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,490
Do what it says.
No!

935
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,258
Listen to it, Jenna.
No!

936
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,526
Open your eyes.

937
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,662
[***]

938
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:32,797
Get off of me!

939
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:34,064
Open your eyes.

940
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,153
Cat?

941
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,654
Wakey, wakey.

942
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,356
[In deep voice]
Time to get nakey.

943
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:02,292
Jenna just went
upstairs to get you.

944
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,828
I'm not there.

945
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:05,162
Obviously.

946
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,564
We have to get Jenna
and get out of here.

947
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:09,533
Jenna can wait.

948
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,601
This can't.

949
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:14,304

Stop it.
No!

956
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,004
Look at it, Jenna.

957
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:50,140
[Screams, grunts]

958
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,608

I think it's over.

972
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:58,876
Guess I turned that
freaky-deaky pervert into jelly.

973

Oh.
