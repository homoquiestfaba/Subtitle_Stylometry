This is detective Tom Caretti.

192

He'll be investigating
your girlfriend's murder.

193
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:10,234
Okay, Miles, so, uh...

194
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,136
where were you
when this happened?

195
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:15,839
We were...

196
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,172
you know.

197
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:22,109
Look, you need to tell me
exactly what happened.

198
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,782
We were kissing

199
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,784
And sort of pulling off
each other's clothes.

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,691
I went into my backpack,
'cause, you know,

00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,860
I wanted to make sure
i had, uh...

207
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,567
From here to the new station,
all right?

208
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,316
Got it?

209
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,140
Sorry, Miles.
Go ahead.

210
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,709
I couldn't find one.

211
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,145
So I turned away
for a second.

212
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,577
You want to see these?

213
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:57,246
And then I felt...

214
00:11:57,247 --> 00:12:00,267
the hairs on the back of my neck
stood up.

215
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,555
And then when I looked back,

216
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,188
He was standing
behind jenny.

217
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,558
Who?

218
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't know who.

219
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,831
He says someone
just appeared there.

220
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,330
I didn't hear a noise.

221
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:17,867
No door or anything.
No footsteps.

out of nowhere.

[Blade slices]

224
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,710
Her head was swinging
back and forth...

225
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,544
like he grabbed her
by her hair...

226
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:31,882
and chopped it off
at the same time.

227
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:33,547
With what exactly?

228
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:35,884
He had something,

229
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,320
Something metal.

230
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,258
A sword maybe.

231
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,656
I don't know.

232
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:44,327
He had it,
and then he didn't.

233
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,097
Everything happened too quick.

234
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,097
Did you get a look
at the killer?

235
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,566
I couldn't see
his face,

236
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,984
Just shadows.

237
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,506
So a dark, shadowy figure?

00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:57,940
Yeah.

239
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,842
And then what happened?

240
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:02,510
He jumped out the window.

241
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:05,182
What floor were they on?

242
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:07,083
Fifth.

I know how it sounds,

245
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,089
But that's what happened.

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,256

i was at the hospital.

to change your story...

Are you sure?

'Cause we dusted jenny's room

Agreed.

560
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,233
I just need him

561
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:19,503
and you can observe.

562

If you don't want
to go through with this,

563
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,505

He walks in
the front door...

574
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:22,065
with Jenny Garrison's head,

575
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:25,651

loaded with human remains.

576
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,143
Doesn't seem to make
much sense, does it?

577
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,312

579
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:40,149
after 13 years.

580
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,018
Maybe I'm not so crazy.

581
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,388
Cole, what do you got
on this book?

582
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,727
Some of it's written
in an ancient dialect,

583
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:52,896
But the title is a direct
translation from German:

584
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,565
"Every hundred years".

585
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,650
May I?

586
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,606
What do you think?

587
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:05,442
One of my patients
was an old German woman...

588
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,878
who claimed she was impregnated
by a demon,

589
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:13,249
a demon who needed a human host
to regenerate.

590
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,251
At the end of its 100-Year
life cycle,

591
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,755
he would find a host,
plant a seed,

592
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,257
and die at sunrise.

593
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:22,759
[Sighs]

594
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,260
She claimed the birth
almost killed her.

595
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,593
Her nightmares
were so intense,

596
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:30,999
She had to sleep
in four-point restraints.

597
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,203
A demon
that does the nasty,

598
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,438
it's, like, right out
of a comic book.

599
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:39,108
That demon is called
an Incubus.

600
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,280
So...

601
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,948
what is the subtitle
of this book?

602
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:49,787
Ihr gestalt ist meine.

603
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,890
"Your mind is mine".

608
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,409
we finally get to meet,
face-to-face.

609
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,047
Inkubus, right?

610
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,545
Oh, a staring contest.

611
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,217

I can stare too.

00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,127
Ah, yes.

614
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:36,133

I'm getting tired
of your bullshit, okay?

617
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,673
Before I ask any questions,

618
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:46,174
Is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

619
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:48,179
No.

620
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,012
How did you
get in here tonight?

621
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:52,650
Magic.

622
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,582

625
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:03,158
Those are tricks,
misdirection, sleight of hand.

626
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,595
Real magic bends reality.

627
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:09,432
So how did you get
into Jenny Garrison's room?

628
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,669
Did you just
abracadabra yourself into it?

629
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,336
Yes, and then
I cut off her head...

630
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,175
and left for here.

631
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,844
Any reason?

632
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,177
It's what I do.

633
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:27,783
Besides, how else was I going
to attract your attention?

634
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:30,620
So how long has it been now,
hmm?

635
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,654
12, 13 years, Gil?

636
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:36,994
I'd almost forgotten
how good it feels.

637
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,995
Magic or killing?

638
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:43,148
Killing is magic.

639
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,970
You see...
it's Caretti, isn't it?

640
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:50,505
Detective Caretti.

641
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:53,008
Yes, well...

642
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,845
I had become frustrated

643
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:59,181
At not receiving the acclaim
i so richly deserve,

644
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:03,019
So I began using my mark.

645
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,023
The "k"?

646
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:07,188
Yes, the "k".

647
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:10,692
Even then, some glory hound...

648
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,764
attempted to take credit
for my accomplishments.

649
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:17,767
Let me see
if I get this straight.

650
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,768
This whole thing...

651
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,806
is about you getting credit
for what you've done,

652
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:26,310
kind of like
a little ego trip?

653
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,642
So why should we believe...

654
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:29,978
that you're not just
some fucking glory hound?

655
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:32,149
Well, if anyone should know,

656
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,149
it should be you.

657
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,486
You were the best.

658
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,988
You got the closest to me.

659
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:41,691
When Chris Dawson
was arrested for my kill,

660
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:45,696
It was you who proved
it couldn't have been him.

661
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,198
You knew you had
the wrong man,

662
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,530
Just like the man I killed...

663
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:52,100
that the cops ID'd
as Inkubus.

664
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,968
I can't wait to hear this.

665
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,471
Diamante and his team...

666
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:59,640
were getting close.

667
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:02,480
You were ruthless,

668
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,715
Relentless.

669
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,550
So I killed a vagrant
to throw off the scent.

670
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:11,556
You were right, Gil.

671
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,054
But nobody would listen.

672
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:16,426
So case closed.

673
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:20,331
I can't imagine the pain
you must have endured,

674
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,167
the humiliation.

675
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,334
But I do like to try.

676
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:28,071

01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:20,907
[Murmuring]
Hey, Gil...

1110
01:01:20,908 --> 01:01:22,077
[gunshot]

1111
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,480
Oh, you better have not
lost your touch.

1112
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,082
[Thunder crashing]

1113
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:31,170
[Loud banging]

1114
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,105
[Water dripping]

1115
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,856
[Door slams loudly]

1116
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:12,875
David?

1117
01:03:16,156 --> 01:03:18,093
So you know...

1118
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,258
who I am?

1119
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:21,695
Yes.

1120
01:03:21,696 --> 01:03:24,597
- Have you been locked up
in that room all these years?

1121
01:03:24,598 --> 01:03:26,432
He takes me out.

1122
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:29,521
Sometimes.

1123
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:35,610
Has he ever taken you
out here?

1124
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,695
Yes.

1125
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:49,590
This is where I used to come
to think.

1126
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:53,930
Mostly about you.

1127
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,095
I never stopped
looking for you, David.

1128
01:03:57,096 --> 01:03:58,833
I know.

1129
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:01,101
He pitied that.

1130
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:04,189
He's a monster.
You know that.

1131
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,512
All these years...

1132
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,678
not knowing whether
you were alive or...

1133
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,430
I'm fine.

1134
01:04:16,984 --> 01:04:18,152
He taught me.

1135
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:21,237
He's a good father.

1136
01:04:22,756 --> 01:04:24,924
What did he teach you?

1137
01:04:24,925 --> 01:04:27,094
How weak people are.

1138
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:29,262
You take one simple thing
away from them,

1139
01:04:29,263 --> 01:04:32,764
And their lives
are never the same.

1140
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:35,502
They crumble.

1141
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:38,508
He never wanted me
to be like that.

1142
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:40,506
And are you,

1143
01:04:40,507 --> 01:04:42,310
like that?

1144
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:45,113
No.

1145
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:48,732
You look just like your mom.

1146
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,954
Do you remember living with
your mom and me?

1147
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:57,875
You're clinging to a life
that doesn't exist anymore.

1148
01:04:59,694 --> 01:05:01,362
That's all
I've had to cling to...

1149
01:05:01,363 --> 01:05:04,732
these past 13 years, son.

1150
01:05:04,733 --> 01:05:08,500
I am gonna beat him.
You know that.

1151
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:10,570
You can't beat him.

1152
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:13,908
Why do you think
he's never been caught?

1153
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,910
He's a demon.

1154
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:21,081
And what do people,
all people,

1155
01:05:21,082 --> 01:05:23,634
have to confront?

1156
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,753
[Sighs]

1157
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:29,256
Their demons.

1158
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:31,257
Is that what this night
is all about?

1159
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:33,160
Yes.

1160
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:38,264
Tonight,
you get closure.

1161
01:05:38,265 --> 01:05:42,519
[Thunder crashing]

1162
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:50,011
Hello?

1163
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,181
Is anybody out there?
Come back.

1164
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,847
[Static and beeping]

1165
01:05:53,848 --> 01:05:55,181
23-09, go ahead.

1166
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:56,518
Make sure they get here.

1167
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,952
I'm gonna go on the rooftop,
okay?

1168
01:05:57,953 --> 01:05:59,954
Okay... wait!

1169
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:04,627
Just be careful.
Okay?

1170
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:07,210
I love you.

1171
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,368
I love you too.

1172
01:06:15,369 --> 01:06:17,371
I wanted to tell you this
earlier at the office,

1173
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:18,539
but you ran out so quickly.

1174
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,704
I didn't get a chance...

1175
01:06:19,705 --> 01:06:21,874
what are you talking about?

1176
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:24,978
The dark stranger...

1177
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:28,647
that's the best
they could come up with.

1178
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:30,948
Of course they couldn't
describe him.

1179
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:33,752
How can you describe something
you can't see?

1180
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:37,755
It has to justify
the awful deed it committed.

1181
01:06:37,756 --> 01:06:39,759
They could never explain him

1182
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,929
Because they never
truly saw him.

1183
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,465
They could sense
he was with them.

1184
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:49,437
But how can that be explained?

1185
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,002
He's never been caught...

1186
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:56,277
'cause he's always the person
you'd least expect.

1187
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,444
Listen, he's just...
he's messing with your mind.

1188
01:06:58,445 --> 01:07:00,416
I mean, this is one
big fucking nightmare, okay?

1189
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:01,916
[Sobbing]
This isn't a nightmare.

1190
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,048
It's all gonna be over soon.

1191
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:04,217
It's all gonna be over soon.

1192
01:07:04,218 --> 01:07:06,052
Listen, I need you here,
okay?

1193
01:07:06,053 --> 01:07:08,353
Just until backup gets here.

1194
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:11,275
I love you.
All right?

1195
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:14,560
I got to go help Diamante,
okay?

1196
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:16,647
Go, go.

1197
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,451
[Thunder crashing]

1198
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:28,042
You saw him tonight,

1199
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:31,545
'cause he let you.

1200
01:07:31,546 --> 01:07:34,048
He's giving you the chance
to forget your old life

1201
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:37,369
And live this one,
in this moment.

1202
01:07:39,952 --> 01:07:43,625
So where is Inkubus now?

1203
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,294
David.

1204
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:49,163
Where he always is.

1205
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:52,032
Really?

1206
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:53,734
You sure
you're thinking straight?

1207
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,318
I've never thought
more clearly in my life.

1208
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:03,745
You're not gonna kill
your son.

1209
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,245
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up.

1210
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:08,515
I'm calling the shots now.

1211
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:11,183
You took everything
from me.

1212
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:14,687
Well, almost everything.

1213
01:08:14,688 --> 01:08:18,857
You see, you never really took
full control of my mind.

1214
01:08:18,858 --> 01:08:20,191
I always fought you.

1215
01:08:20,192 --> 01:08:22,494
No, you're wrong.

1216
01:08:22,495 --> 01:08:23,996
He's in your head.

1217
01:08:23,997 --> 01:08:28,502
No, not anymore.

1218
01:08:28,503 --> 01:08:30,336
You killed my wife

1219
01:08:30,337 --> 01:08:32,406
And my son.

1220
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:33,571
Dad!

1221
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,577
Don't call me dad.

1222
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,913
You are not my boy.

1223
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,495
[Spits]

1224
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:45,668
Captain, drop the gun now!

1225
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:53,128
It's all right,
Detective.

1226
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,211
I figured it out.

1227
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,266
It's over.

1228
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:00,431
That's great.

1229
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:01,535
Just take it easy.

1230
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:03,036
Don't do anything crazy.

1231
01:09:03,037 --> 01:09:06,874
Just lower the gun, slowly.

1232
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,445
Closure, right?

1233
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,612
It ends tonight, demon.

1234
01:09:12,613 --> 01:09:13,613
No!

1235
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:14,616
[Gunshot]

1236
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:17,401
No!

1237
01:09:22,688 --> 01:09:26,659
[Gunshots]

1238
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,748
[Thunder crashing]

1239
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:33,251
[Explosion]

1240
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:42,460
[Police sirens wailing]

1241
01:10:06,366 --> 01:10:09,369
It's horrible.

1242
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:13,873
Horrible, yes,
but...

1243
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:20,679
the facts are
your wife that died in labor.

1244
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,048
And you have to accept that.

1245
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:25,216
[Scoffs]

1246
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:26,887
You're just like
everybody else.

1247
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:28,321
You only hear
what you want to hear.

1248
01:10:28,322 --> 01:10:30,908
You think I'm a fucking loon.

1249
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:35,663
How can we believe you,
Tom?

1250
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,497
How can we believe
that demons

1251
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:40,002
Are ripping people's spines
apart

1252
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:41,501
And cutting people in half?

1253
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:44,204
How are we going
to believe you?

1254
01:10:44,205 --> 01:10:46,373
There's evidence there.

1255
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:52,713
The truth is that
you had a trauma.

1256
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:56,716
The truth is that
you lost a baby.

1257
01:10:56,717 --> 01:11:01,389
You lost people
you love very much.

1258
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,892
And you are dealing with it
by fabricating illusions...

1259
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:10,729
and making up demons.

1260
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:16,236
Your mind is creating
a reality that you can live in.

1261
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:21,325
Your wife died in childbirth,
Tom.

1262
01:11:23,444 --> 01:11:25,780
She hemorrhaged.

1263
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,383
They attempted a C-section...

1264
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,882
deep breaths and push.

1265
01:11:29,883 --> 01:11:32,050
And it failed.

1266
01:11:32,051 --> 01:11:35,388
But the more you look
at the cold, hard facts...

1267
01:11:35,389 --> 01:11:38,391
for what they are,

1268
01:11:38,392 --> 01:11:41,058
The more you can achieve
closure...

1269
01:11:41,059 --> 01:11:43,031
honey, honey, honey!

1270
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:47,700
Real closure.

1271
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:49,701
This is bullshit!

1272
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:53,238
My wife didn't die
in labor.

1273
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:54,572
It was him.

1274
01:11:54,573 --> 01:11:56,209
Every 100 years,
he finds a host,

1275
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,211
and that host
happened to be my wife.

1276
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:00,078
You don't unders...
no, again, I'll tell you!

1277
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:02,417
The demon came out
of my wife's stomach.

1278
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,249
Tom,

1279
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,786
do you realize
how this sounds?

1280
01:12:06,787 --> 01:12:07,952
There is a demon out there!

1281
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:09,124
You don't understand!

1282
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:12,459
I told you a million
frickin' times!

1283
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,830
One more time,
there is a demon out there!

1284
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,166
He is killing everybody!

1285
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,998
There is a demon...
where are you going?

1286
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:21,667
You need to talk to me now!

1287
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:23,338
You wanted to talk.
