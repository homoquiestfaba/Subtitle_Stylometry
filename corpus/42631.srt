Prepare number-three tube

00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,231
Switch fire control console to primary.

00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,136
Captain, we've been fired on.

- Estimate torpedo at 6,000 meters.
- The drill is over.

43
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,162
Well, Comrade Polenin...

44
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:51,208
do you have an explanation
for this disappointment?

45
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,046
Comrade Admiral, it's just another
burnout in the ignition sequence.

46
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,383
Comrade Captain, I will require
the names of those responsible.

47
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,469
I don't know their names. How the hell
would I know the name of the jackass...

48
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:07,140
that supplied a 30 kopeck insulator
to do a 50 kopeck job?

49
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,476
That's what I have to fight
before I can fight a war.

50
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:15,023
Comrade Admiral, the boat
will be at sea on schedule...

51
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,025
before the month is out.

52
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,320
I'll give you a name. My name. Polenin.

53
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,906
Mikhail. Captain, K-1 9.

54
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,241
Write it down.

55
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,852
Afteryou've successfully
completed trials...

56
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,479
on the mechanical, propulsion
and navigation systems...

57
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,981
in the Bering Sea...

58
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,608
you'll proceed beneath the ice
to the launch area here...

59
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,863
and test-fire the missile.

60
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,748
My orders were to prepare K-1 9 for sea
trials, and they'll begin on schedule.

61
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,960
But until the trials are complete...

62
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,254
to undertake an exercise of this scope...

63
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:47,593
may be, with respect, premature.

64
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,479
There is no doubt in my mind...

65
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,481
that K-1 9 is ready to fulfill her mission.

66
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,527
Operation Arctic Circle
is no mere exercise.

67
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:10,157
What is to stop the Americans
from destroying Moscow and Leningrad?

68
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,159
Only one thing.

69
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,079
A certain knowledge...

70
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,916
of destruction in return.

71
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,212
K-1 9 is that knowledge.

72
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:29,426
But not until Kennedy has been told
by his own spy planes that we have it...

73
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,096
and it works.

74
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,933
I promised Comrade Khrushchev...

75
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,187
that the American president will receive
his message before the end of the month.

76
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,813
Comrade Marshall...

77
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:46,068
perhaps Captain Polenin might--

78
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,280
Captain Polenin put his boat
and his men before the party.

79
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,574
He will be underyour command.

80
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,829
That's all there is to it.

81
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,802
- A captain on the CCP.
- Captain.

82
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,764
- What's your name, please?
- Demichev.

83
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,558
Torpedo officer, Comrade Captain.

84
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,811
May I ask the captain's name
and his purpose aboard our boat?

85
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,899
My name is Vostrikov.
Where's Captain Polenin?

86
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,694
Come in.

87
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,196
Yes?

88
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,533
- Good morning, Captain.
- Comrade Captain Vostrikov.

89
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,245
That'll be all, Yuri. Come in. Please.

90
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,836
Captain.

91
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,214
With the short lead-in time to sea trials...

92
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,175
headquarters wanted
your expertise on board...

93
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,511
and I'm pleased to have it.

94
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,055
I know this could be difficult--

95
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,058
It's never difficult
to do one's duty, Captain.

96
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,730
I was preparing my briefing
on the crew and on the boat.

97
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,525
- I see.
- The problem's fitting her out.

98
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,194
But my orders said you would
not be arriving until tomorrow.

99
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,032
The briefing can wait.
Please, show me the boat.

100
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,033
Of course.

101
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,002
We're finally getting
the turbines up to speed.

102
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,341
With luck, I'd say in another week
we might be able to run a test.

103
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,344
The equipment has not yet arrived,
Comrade Captain.

104
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,856
- Noted, Comrade Captain.
- The reactor compartment.

105
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,875
How hot are you running it?

106
00:11:47,### --> 00:11:50,043
We're at 50 percent
for the turbine test, Captain.

107
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,339
What is the absorption rate of the rods?

108
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,425
Three percent above normal.

109
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,929
Where is the reactor officer?

110
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,893
Lieutenant Yashin?

111
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,629
This man is drunk. Do you tolerate this?

112
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,007
- Of course not.
- Prepare charges against this man.

113
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,927
Inform command
we need an immediate replacement.

114
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,595
Yes, Captain.

115
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,976
Lieutenant Yashin is
the best reactor officer in the navy.

116
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,647
He's never been drunk on duty before.
We need him, Captain.

117
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,191
I urge you to reconsider.

118
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:58,946
I want this boat out of dry dock.
Sea trials begin in two weeks.

119
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,241
The boat isn't ready, Captain.
The problem is Moscow.

120
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,743
They organize party VIP tours...

121
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,454
while we're stuck with incompetent
yard crews and defective parts.

122
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,123
Sea trials will begin as scheduled.

123
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,626
We deliver or we drown.

124
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,905
In the history of the Soviet navy...

125
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,741
no sailors...

126
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:49,246
have been given such a boat as K-1 9.

127
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,334
It is the finest submarine in the world.

128
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,504
You have been given the honor
to be her crew.

129
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,883
I have been given
the honor to be your captain.

130
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,346
Without me...

131
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,182
you are nothing.

132
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,482
Without you...

133
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,234
I am nothing.

134
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,904
Much is expected of us.

135
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,073
We will not fail.

136
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:08,992
We're cursed.

137
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,709
Easy, easy. Keep it level.

138
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,379
Steady!

139
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,381
Now, down. Down.

140
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,223
Coming through.
Permission to pass.

141
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,434
- What do you have there?
- A new scope for the sonar station.

142
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,604
- Carry on. Install it.
- I work on the reactor.

143
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,025
- Where is the sonar officer?
- He's on a 24-hour pass.

144
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,113
Captain, I initiated the relief rotation.

145
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,448
- It's good for efficiency.
- No more passes. Cancel all leaves.

146
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:52,286
-We need everyone here to do their jobs.
-Yes, Captain.

147
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,954
Comrade Captain.

148
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,749
Lieutenant Vadim Radtchenko
reporting for duty.

149
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,253
I'm your new reactor officer.

150
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,674
- What was your last posting?
- Nuclear training academy.

151
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,093
- What was your last posting?
- Nuclear training academy.

152
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,722
He's never operated a reactor at sea.

153
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,557
I was first in my class.

154
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,226
Thanks.

155
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,313
- Report to the reactor control room.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,108
- That way.
- Thank you.

157
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,404
- Captain--
- He's qualified...

158
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,199
or command wouldn't have
sent him to us.

159
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,203
Officer on deck.

160
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,956
Pavel Loktev, senior technician.

161
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,251
Stepan Komarov, Anatoly Subachev...

162
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,379
Grigori Dyomin, Oleg Argunov.

163
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,381
Show me to the control room.

164
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,012
Watch out! I have to stop the truck.

165
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,099
They gave me the wrong drugs!

166
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,730
Stop the truck!

167
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,653
Stop! Stop!

168
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,446
Wrong drugs!

169
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,700
You gave me the wrong drugs!

170
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,952
You idiot! Stop!

171
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,420
Doctor!

172
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,422
It's the doctor!

173
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,727
He's dead.

174
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,899
Stay with the body
until the ambulance comes.

175
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,693
The rest ofyou, back to work.

176
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,198
Back to work!

177
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,872
Gavril.

178
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:58,055
Captain. Ever since
the solid ballast was loaded...

179
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,098
we've had a half-degree list to port.

180
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,267
I've tried everything,
but she won't even up.

181
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,730
Half-degree we can handle.

182
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,734
We'll compensate with seawater ballast
till we get back to port.

183
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,945
Ifwe get back to port.

184
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,700
You know what the men
are calling this boat?

185
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,744
The Widowmaker.

186
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,996
Five died from fumes sealing the tanks.

187
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,624
Another four in construction.
And now the doctor.

188
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,626
The champagne bottle.

189
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,254
Ten dead...

190
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,422
and we haven't left dock.

191
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,634
I'm surprised they confide their fears
to their commanding officer.

192
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,806
A crew is a family.
The captain is the father.

193
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,561
My own father inspired
more fear than he indulged.

194
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,818
I was told there are two versions
about your father.

195
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,281
One, he was a hero of the Revolution.

196
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,283
Two, he died in the gulag.

197
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,911
Both are true.

198
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:08,500
How are those safety checks
going on down below, Captain?

199
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,002
Proceeding.

200
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,007
Misha, Misha.

201
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,177
There you go.

202
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,471
Forty centimeters of headroom,
and he gives half to a rodent.

203
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,849
Yevgeny...

204
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,851
wrap this around your private parts.

205
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,853
The gamma rays can--

206
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,482
You should also take your dosimeter
once a day to the doctor.

207
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,817
Why?

208
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,696
He reads it and tells you how long
you have before your torpedo falls off.

209
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,542
Captain?

210
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,006
I'm Gennardi Savran,
your new medical officer.

211
00:20:56,131 --> 00:21:01,053
- What was your last posting?
- No. I am the base physician here.

212
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,889
They said there was an emergency.
So here I am.

213
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,350
Welcome to K-1 9, Doctor.

214
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,145
Captain, we will be back soon, won't we?

215
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,315
- I get--
- What?

216
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,734
Seasick.

217
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,612
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

218
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,906
Misha, please.

219
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:24,076
- Vostrikov marries a girl--
- Yuri, you promised. You promised.

220
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:28,455
Vostrikov marries a girl
with top party connections.

221
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,333
He knows which fork they use for salads,
so they make him a captain.

222
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,670
- That's why you've never been promoted.
- Be quiet.

223
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,840
We are all good communists here.

224
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,427
- To good communists.
- To good communists!

225
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:51,520
You're drunk. Sit down. Sit down.
Gentlemen, a little bit of respect.

226
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:55,774
Captain Vostrikov does not
know you the way I do.

227
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,861
You're still the captain,
as far as we're concerned.

228
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,280
He's the captain.
I'm executive officer.

229
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,157
I'm pleased. I'm gonna be with my boys.

230
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:05,659
My turn.

231
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:12,124
They say there was a cosmonaut
who orbited Earth before Yuri Gagarin.

232
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,627
But he was not loyal enough...

233
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,379
to hold his breath...

234
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,924
when his life-support system gave out.

235
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,801
So now...

236
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,803
he never existed.

237
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,683
Gagarin was lucky.

238
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,394
Let's hope we are too.

239
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,688
- To luck!
- To luck!

240
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,163
Kataya!

241
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,061
- Don't worry.
- Don't go.

242
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,234
Please.

243
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,958
Defense Minister Zolentsov,
Admiral Bratyeev...

244
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,711
request permission to carry out orders
in defense of the motherland.

245
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,381
Carry out your patriotic duty.

246
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,053
- All hands down.
- All hands down!

247
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,940
- Single up all lines.
- Single up all lines.

248
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,150
- Single up lines!
- Confirm single up!

249
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,152
Land the gangway.

250
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,821
Land the gangway!

251
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,073
Gangway landed!

252
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,117
Gangway landed!

253
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:14,246
- K-1 9 ready for sea, Captain.
- Port turbine, slow ahead.

254
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,290
Port turbine, slow ahead.

255
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,584
Slow ahead together!

256
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,850
I just hope you picked the right man.

257
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:37,037
- All compartments prepare to dive.
- Top hatches closed and latched.

258
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,541
- Open the midship vent.
- Midship vent open.

259
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,460
- Ready to dive, Captain.
- Dive the boat.

260
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,713
Speed six knots.
Make your depth 50 meters.

261
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,007
Speed six knots.
Planesman, make your depth 50 meters.

262
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,385
- Making depth 50 meters.
- Slow ahead together.

263
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,971
Slow ahead together.

264
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,682
- Course?
- Course is steady 3-2-3, Captain.

265
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,227
- Depth under the keel.
- Echo sound reads 350 meters, Captain.

266
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:13,574
Twenty meters.

267
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,220
Thirty meters.

268
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:40,475
Don't worry. It'll stop
once the pressure increases.

269
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:46,064
Simulate an electrical fire
in the galley, please.

270
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,654
Fire in switchbox number 65.

271
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,823
This is a drill. Repeat. This is a drill.

272
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,325
This is a drill. Repeat. This is a drill.

273
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,044
It's stuck.

274
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,670
Fifty meters.

275
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,174
Fire has spread
to the next compartment.

276
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,219
Simulate electrical failure,
compartment four.

277
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,932
Electrical failure, compartment four.
This is a drill.

278
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,476
Compartment four,
loss of electrical power.

279
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:26,563
- This is a drill.
- Emergency lights. Let's go.

280
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,946
Fire's out in the galley, Captain.

281
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,825
Too much damage.
Too many casualties.

282
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:44,206
Simulate flooding, compartment four.
Make them work in the dark.

283
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,597
If this were not a drill...

284
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,141
the boat would be crippled
and half the crew would be dead.

285
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:07,271
- Let me speak to the officer in charge.
- Try it again tomorrow.

286
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:35,132
I only wanted to say...

287
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:40,012
how sympathetic I am
about the change in command.

288
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:44,391
These decisions aren't always
for us to understand.

289
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,269
Thankyou, Comrade Suslov.

290
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,981
Still, you must feel it's an honor...

291
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,108
to serve on this boat in any capacity.

292
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,030
- Indeed.
- It's historic.

293
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,368
Excuse me.

294
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,544
Checking the aft pressurizer?

295
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:14,880
Yes, Lieutenant.

296
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,759
You know religious icons are forbidden.

297
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,062
This is the future, Pavel.

298
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:35,067
Cars that never need refueling.
Free power for every family.

299
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,111
Maybe even travel to the planets.

300
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,656
It's a privilege to be a part of this future.

301
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:42,658
Yes, Lieutenant.

302
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,458
Good morning, gentlemen.

303
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,011
- What's this?
- At sea we only shower on Saturdays.

304
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:47,097
Action stations. Chemical fire
in motor control compartment.

305
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,808
This is a drill.

306
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,019
Watch out!

307
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,196
Fire in the main switchboard. C2 L.

308
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,617
Valve rupture in compartment eight.

309
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:12,247
Torpedo fuel spill in aft torpedo room.

310
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,673
Start the drill again.

311
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,704
Comrades, officers and sailors,
remember...

312
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:56,333
the American propaganda
will always try to play...

313
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:56,375
the American propaganda
will always try to play...

314
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,919
on your baser, primitive instincts.

315
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,964
Greed, lust, individualism.

316
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,676
In American propaganda,
you will see how everybody...

317
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,762
has a car, nice clothes,
a nice apartment...

318
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:12,182
but you will never see
the truth behind this lie.

319
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:16,103
You will not see police dogs attacking
strikers and civil rights demonstrators.

320
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,606
You will not see the beggars
in the streets, the homeless...

321
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,066
the Negro shantytowns of the South.

322
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,902
You will not see the warmongers...

323
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:26,280
who threaten the world
with nuclear holocaust.

324
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:35,622
Stand by to simulate
firing torpedo number eight.

325
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,166
Number eight isn't loaded, Captain.

326
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,668
I know that.

327
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:43,172
I want you to unload
seven and load eight.

328
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,924
Now, please.

329
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,426
Captain.

330
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:51,346
Ice formations near our depth.

331
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,515
I suggest we go deeper
and run the drill later.

332
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,562
Negative. Ice formations will not
be suspended in the event ofwar.

333
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,399
Unload seven torpedo.
Load eight torpedo.

334
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:05,777
Unload seven torpedo.
Load eight torpedo. This is a drill.

335
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:08,989
Do we ever stop?

336
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,825
- We need the rest.
- Yevesky, quiet.

337
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,953
Proceed to your action stations
immediately.

338
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,496
Come on!

339
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,502
Engage running gear.

340
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,671
Torpedo withdrawn.

341
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,508
Open breech door number eight.

342
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,135
Traverse torpedo.

343
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,432
Traversing torpedo.

344
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,270
Dmitri! Come on. Help me. Help me!

345
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:46,652
Don't stop!

346
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,996
- Two men are injured.
- Have them seen by the doctor...

347
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,623
and start the drill again.

348
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,377
- Two men short, Captain.
- Have them put the torpedo...

349
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,881
back in tube seven
and start the drill again.

350
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,553
Traverse torpedo!

351
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,638
Traversing torpedo!

352
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:20,352
Going under. Clear.

353
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,690
Attention!

354
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:27,484
At ease.

355
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:32,656
I was told there was some complaining.

356
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,244
But I said, "Not my men.

357
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:40,330
They're the best crew in the fleet.

358
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,125
They will pull to the last."

359
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,835
So...

360
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,296
any complaints?

361
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,090
There's no complaints here, Captain.

362
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,094
Good.

363
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,976
It's not the men's fault.

364
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,103
It's your fault.

365
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,148
The officers.

366
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,775
You have failed to set high standards...

367
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,195
to correct their deficiencies.

368
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,117
Ifyou do your job, the men will do theirs.

369
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,288
That is all.

370
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,682
- What's her name?
- Kataya.

371
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,690
She's pretty.

372
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:55,739
She's pretty.

373
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,327
- Sorry.
- I'm writing to her.

374
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,998
- Where are you going to mail it?
- It's in case I die.

375
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,334
In case you die?

376
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,972
In case I die.

377
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:52,421
Report to captain.
Five miles from missile launch area.

378
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,423
We are ahead ofschedule.

379
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,767
Good morning, gentlemen.

380
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,188
Course to steer, 1 -8-5.

381
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:10,689
1 -8-5.

382
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,277
Captain.

383
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,614
Captain.

384
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,241
Conduct emergency dive drill.

385
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,744
Bow planes are jammed 20 degrees down.

386
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:28,373
- Bow planes jammed 20 degrees down.
- Set. Twenty degrees down.

387
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:36,089
- Bow planes jammed 20 degrees down.
- I have the conn.

388
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:40,344
Move!

389
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:52,731
1 20 meters.

390
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,073
1 30 meters.

391
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,244
1 40 meters.

392
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,791
1 50 meters.

393
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,672
Take the boat down
to maximum operational depth.

394
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,301
Make your depth 250 meters.

395
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,221
Turbines slow ahead together.

396
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,508
240 meters.

397
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,180
250 meters.

398
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:09,433
Captain, I respectfully suggest
going below 250 meters...

399
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,185
is an unnecessary risk.

400
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,187
Continue the dive to 300 meters.

401
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,523
300 meters is close to crush depth.

402
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:18,609
I know.

403
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,616
260 meters.

404
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,745
Make your depth 300 meters.

405
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,762
280 meters.

406
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,226
290 meters.

407
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,446
300 meters, Captain.

408
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,450
- Level the planes.
- Level the bow planes.

409
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,688
Simulate flooding
in the aft torpedo room...

410
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:40,148
and emergency surface.

411
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,943
A rapid ascent beneath the ice cap
is not advisable, Captain.

412
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:46,363
I did not ask foryour advice.

413
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,372
Flooding in compartment ten.
Emergency surface.

414
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:58,709
Go, go, go, go, go!

415
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,503
Man stations!

416
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,384
Poliansky, bring the planes
to full rise. Keep ten up.

417
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,803
Make turns for 20 knots.
Full ahead together.

418
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:14,057
Planes to full rise. Full ahead
together. Keep ten up. Speed 20 knots.

419
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,153
Pavel, wedge!

420
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,408
Hold it steady! Go!

421
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,543
Go! Go! Go!

422
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:53,847
- The rupture is sealed, Captain.
- Excellent.

423
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:56,350
Recommend we stay
at safe depth, Captain.

424
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,855
- How thick is the ice here?
- Kornilov.

425
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,941
Ice recon.

426
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:08,237
- Come on. Come on.
- Less than one meter in this area.

427
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:14,201
- These reports are almost a week old.
- This time ofyear...

428
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,745
the ice is only getting thinner.
Continue surfacing.

429
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,206
I'm not sure ifwe can control
an ascent this fast, Captain.

430
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,378
- Neither am I.
- 1 30 meters.

431
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:28,799
1 20 meters.

432
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,639
- 1 1 0 meters.
- Blow main ballast.

433
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:45,023
- She's starting to roll.
- Permission to hold at safe depth.

434
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,359
- Denied.
- 80 meters.

435
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,444
Pump room,
are we pumping the trim tanks?

436
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,779
She's rolling to port.

437
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:00,998
- Blow port. Shut starboard.
- Changing over to alternate air supply.

438
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,375
- 60 meters.
- Stop turbines.

439
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,751
Stop both turbines.

440
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:09,089
- Level off, damn it.
- 40 meters.

441
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,218
- Brace for impact.
- Brace for impact!

442
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,179
Brace for impact.

443
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:30,254
Take the conn.

444
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:35,050
Raise the radio and radar masts.

445
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,052
Give them three sweeps.
Medium range.

446
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:08,250
Prepare to fire the test missile.

447
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:24,641
Prepare to launch test missile.
This is not a drill.

448
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,066
Central command,
missile control manned and ready.

449
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:35,777
Preparing silo three for firing test missile.

450
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:42,576
Power up console for missile launch.

451
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,837
Number-three launch door opening.

452
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:20,781
Comrade Captain, Moscow confirms
test missile launch authority.

453
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:34,127
Attention! Initiating
power-up procedure, Captain.

454
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:35,629
Very well.

455
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,102
Fueling in progress.

456
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:54,565
Simulate activation of the warhead,
number-three missile.

457
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,779
Let's go. Come on.

458
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:04,616
- Contacts?
- No contacts.

459
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,952
Radar, sonar. Contacts?

460
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,746
No contacts.

461
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:22,050
- Fueling complete. Table elevated.
- Ready for firing sequence.

462
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,053
Fire missile three.

463
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:28,932
Time to launch:

464
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:30,684
Fifteen seconds.

465
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,769
1 4, 1 3, 1 2...

466
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:35,564
1 1, 1 0, 9...

467
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,482
8, 7...

468
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:40,152
6, 5...

469
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:41,987
4, 3...

470
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,531
2, 1.

471
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:21,527
Confirm missile away, Captain.

472
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,535
Congratulations, Comrade Captain.

473
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,454
We just wrote our names
into the history books.

474
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:35,874
Captain.

475
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,377
Confirm successful missile launch
to fleet command.

476
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:39,753
Yes, Captain.

477
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:44,800
This is the captain.

478
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:48,262
We have successfully
launched ourtest missile.

479
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,472
All hands stand down
from combat stations.

480
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:52,432
Yes!

481
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:06,947
You will be in my report
for leaving your post.

482
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,657
And you will be in mine.

483
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,578
You needlessly endangered
this boat and its crew.

484
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,874
Two hundred million Soviet citizens are
depending on us, Captain Vostrikov...

485
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:19,751
to save them from nuclear attack.
You risked them as well.

486
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:22,796
I took this boat and these men
to the edge...

487
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:25,924
because we need to know where it is.

488
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:29,678
These 1 20 men are a crew now because
they achieved something together...

489
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:32,139
that they did not think they could do.

490
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,975
Next time, when it is not a drill...

491
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,103
they will go to the edge and past it
and die, if necessary...

492
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:41,190
because that is what
their duty demands of them.

493
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,863
You were lucky, Captain, this time.

494
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,824
I hope I'm on another boat
when your luck runs out.

495
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:54,888
Misha, Yeltsin, come on, quick. Everybody.

496
00:50:56,139 --> 00:51:00,310
Get that laundry out of there.
Form a group around the flag.

497
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,232
Get that laundry out of there.

498
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:09,611
Branan, you're asleep?
On the double. Get closer.

499
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:15,951
Everybody move, yes.

500
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,705
Closer. Closer.

501
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:23,083
Move closer.

502
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:25,252
Winning team closer.

503
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:30,257
Smile.

504
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:37,472
Good.

505
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:22,518
Everything all right? Problems?

506
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:31,777
Yes. There was residual condensation
in the reactor compartment.

507
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:33,820
But I shut down
the number-three generator...

508
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:37,157
and that should reduce the condensation.

509
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,201
I'm counting on you, you know?

510
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,954
Yes, Comrade Captain.

511
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:47,334
Comrade Captain.
Message from command.

512
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,848
Comrade Commander, the crew
is lined up to your order.

513
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:04,893
We have received a message
from Moscow.

514
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:09,189
They congratulate us on the successful
launch of our test missile.

515
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:12,818
- We have proved our readiness.
- Serving the Soviet Union!

516
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:15,487
And now they honor us
with a new assignment.

517
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:21,243
K-1 9 is to assume missile patrol
along the eastern seaboard...

518
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,161
of the United States.

519
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:28,500
This is a mission
of critical strategic importance.

520
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,795
The boat will come
to full operational status.

521
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,258
Do your best. I expect nothing less.

522
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:40,846
Crew dismissed!

523
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,976
He nearly got us killed today.

524
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:49,438
And for what?

525
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:53,692
To show the men he didn't win his bars
by marrying a Politburo member's niece.

526
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,620
You are still our captain, Misha...

527
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:08,874
and the only one we trust.

528
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:16,715
- Captain Polenin?
- Yes.

529
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,218
Captain Vostrikovwants
to see you in the chart room.

530
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,719
Yes.

531
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:39,404
Command wants us on station
as quickly as possible.

532
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:45,410
Our course will take us past
the NATO base at Jan Mayan...

533
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:48,372
and from there to our patrol zone...

534
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,749
400 kilometers off the coastline...

535
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,417
between Washington...

536
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,214
and New York.

537
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:05,347
- Make turns for 1 5 knots.
- Speed 1 5 knots.

538
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,349
Speed 1 5 knots.

539
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:15,023
- No contacts. Down scope.
- Periscope going down.

540
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:20,237
Dive the boat.

541
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,220
Andrei, more wine.

542
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:47,514
You only get one glass.

543
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,933
But because we are
the creme de la creme...

544
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:51,935
a glass of red wine with dinner...

545
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:57,065
is the headquarters' way of telling us
that the crew of the K-1 9 has no equal.

546
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:00,652
No. It's because we're sitting
on a pile of uranium.

547
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:03,238
Red wine gives you strontium...

548
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,282
or takes it away.

549
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,910
Or something. Something good.

550
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:32,267
So, we should be 70 miles...

551
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,437
from Jan Mayan NATO base.

552
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,316
One mountain. No trees. 1 5 men.

553
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:42,903
One radio station.

554
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:45,489
I've seen that island
so many times from the periscope.

555
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:27,531
What's the matter?

556
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:32,119
I miss seeing the trees...

557
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:35,747
seeing the sun, the stars.

558
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,208
You get used to being underwater.

559
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,588
When I muster out...

560
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:45,799
I'll just go work
in the coal mines with my brothers.

561
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,515
So it's all the same to me.

562
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,231
A loss of pressure in the primary
circuit on the aft reactor.

563
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,066
Check the other sensors.

564
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:51,365
Confirm loss of pressure.

565
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,581
Let me through!
Watch out!

566
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,917
- We've got a leak!
- Give me the emergency manual.

567
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:06,880
- Come on!
- Lieutenant...

568
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:08,924
I noticed the pumps
were drawing too much power...

569
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,886
during the turbine tests, but
I didn't think it was serious.

570
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,144
Out of my way!

571
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,021
Move!

572
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:30,654
The control rods are dropping,
Lieutenant.

573
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,908
- Auxiliary pumps.
- Pavel, auxiliary pumps.

574
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,832
- The pumps aren't working either.
- Recycle them!

575
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:45,043
I have, but the pressure
keeps dropping.

576
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:48,672
Confirmed.

577
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,924
- But the rods will cool it, right?
- No.

578
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:54,178
They can't control the reaction
by themselves. They need coolant.

579
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:57,264
Lieutenant, the core temperature
is at 400 degrees and rising.

580
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:59,349
Cut equalization!

581
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:16,158
What's the problem?

582
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:18,660
The primary coolant loop
on the aft reactor's ruptured.

583
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:22,456
- What? How did this happen?
- What difference does it make?

584
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,334
- Answer my question. How?
- I don't know, Captain.

585
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:27,419
The core's heating up.
The mission's over.

586
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:30,589
I'll tell you
when the mission is over.

587
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,382
Who's responsible for this?
I want a name.

588
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:36,178
You want a name? I'll give you
a name-- Vostrikov, Alexei.

589
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:39,014
- Watch yourself, comrade.
- And here's another name--

590
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,557
Radtchenko, Vadim.

591
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:43,727
The untested reactor officer
you put on this boat.

592
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,619
We will fix this problem.

593
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,663
We will continue the mission.

594
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:11,338
- Surface. Surface the boat!
- Surface the boat.

595
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:32,901
- How bad is it?
- The leak is in the sealed area.

596
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:37,322
There's no way to get to it.

597
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:43,120
The temperature will keep rising
till it reaches 1,000 degrees.

598
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:45,038
- And--
- And?

599
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:50,043
- And what?
- No one knows.

600
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:54,339
It could start a chain reaction.

601
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:56,341
There would be radiation leakage.

602
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,552
The core would melt through
the reactor...

603
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:00,888
and start a thermonuclear
explosion.

604
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:12,065
- How long do we have?
- Three or four hours.

605
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:15,444
It could be less.

606
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:25,078
Get whoeveryou need,
regardless of rank.

607
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:28,123
- And solve this.
- Yes, Comrade Captain.

608
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,794
Solve this. That's why you're
here, you understand?

609
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,047
Get up!

610
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:37,257
Get up!

611
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,343
Get up!

612
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:43,305
Doesn't he ever
get tired of drills?

613
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:46,391
Let's go! Let's go!

614
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,950
This is the captain.

615
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:06,453
We've had a malfunction
in the aft reactor.

616
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,499
Measures are being taken
to correct the situation.

617
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,378
Remain atyourstations.

618
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:22,636
- Read it again.
- "In case of sudden drop...

619
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,972
in the pressure
of the primary circuit...

620
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:28,392
measures must be taken to reduce
precipitation heat release."

621
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:31,937
But this doesn't work.
The reflux valve isn't here.

622
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:35,524
- What measures?
- There are none. It's useless.

623
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,818
The rest is about the backup system,
which was never installed.

624
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:41,989
When we reach periscope depth,
I need to speak to fleet command.

625
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:43,824
Yes, Comrade Captain.

626
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:57,337
Why can't we just
shut the reactor down?

627
01:03:57,421 --> 01:04:00,591
We have shut it down, but
we can't control the reaction.

628
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:03,177
Suppose we use the forward
reactor?

629
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:06,889
We could cross-connect its pumps.
Use them to cool both.

630
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:09,558
The rupture in the reactor
is not accessible.

631
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:11,560
Therefore, we can't seal
the leak...

632
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:13,562
and we'd have two reactors
out of control.

633
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:17,941
So we still have
to cool down the reactor.

634
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:22,112
- Permission to speak, Lieutenant.
- Of course.

635
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:27,201
The coolant is
just distilled water.

636
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:32,539
We have 30 tons
of fresh water on board.

637
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:34,374
Yes.

638
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:37,628
- But how do we get it to the core?
- Pass the schematic.

639
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:18,377
I need contact
with fleet command. Now.

640
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:19,837
Still trying, Captain.

641
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:23,841
The air release pipe can deliver
coolant deep enough to the core.

642
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:27,010
We can hack off the valve
and pump in the fresh water.

643
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:29,054
We've got 30 tons, Captain.

644
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:32,766
There's some high-grade pipes
in the torpedoes.

645
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,018
It's not much to weld.
Thirty minutes, at the most.

646
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,064
- And ifwe can't fix it?
- Hiroshima.

647
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:43,610
1.4 megatons, ifyou factor in
the two reactors and the warheads.

648
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,737
Only Hiroshima was less.
It was a lot less.

649
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:48,991
Scuttle the boat.
Get the men off in rafts.

650
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:58,876
We will not abandon this boat.
Scavenge the pipes.

651
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:02,421
We'll be ready to go when command
authorization comes through. Go!

652
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:29,615
- Have you reached fleet command?
- No, Comrade Captain.

653
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:36,205
Captain, the long-range antenna
feeder has shorted out.

654
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,957
The seal must have ruptured
when we submerged.

655
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:43,629
What's the range of the emergency
transmitter, 90 kilometers?

656
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:47,799
- Up to 1 00 kilometers, Captain.
- Core temperature at 490 degrees.

657
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,733
That's it.
Take it, Dmitri.

658
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:12,658
- I'll take it, Captain.
- Take it.

659
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,079
Make sure no debris
gets into the pipes.

660
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:24,753
- Where's the hacksaw?
- Let me have your attention.

661
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:26,588
Men, listen.

662
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:33,679
I have decided that the reactor unit
will affect the repairs.

663
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:37,015
You will go in teams of two.
Ten minutes inside, maximum.

664
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:39,434
- I will go in the first team.
- No.

665
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,562
I need my executive officer
to command.

666
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:44,565
- But under the circumstances--
- I am aware of the circumstances.

667
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:48,819
- It's out of the question.
- I'll go in the first team.

668
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:55,826
- It's my duty.
- I am ready to serve.

669
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:10,549
You will go in with the third
team to inspect the repair.

670
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:14,052
Yes, Comrade Captain.

671
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,472
That is all. Carry on.

672
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:39,244
Quick! Get something!

673
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:44,082
- Quick.
- Fuel spill in aft torpedo!

674
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,085
Good.

675
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,763
- Chief.
- Toolbox.

676
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:06,313
Feed water system isolated!

677
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:09,608
- Vent off the feed water tank.
- I've got three more meters here.

678
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:16,114
Meat.

679
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:19,284
Just meat falling off the bone.

680
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:23,622
Nice and tender.
Melts in your mouth.

681
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:27,709
- Dumplings.
- Dmitri likes dumplings.

682
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,050
Reactor temperature?

683
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,595
Five hundred and thirty degrees.

684
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:42,891
- How long?
- About 1 5 minutes, Captain.

685
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:44,518
Good work.

686
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,728
- Comrade Captain?
- Yes?

687
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:49,273
Our equipment is prepared
and we're standing by to enter.

688
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:51,149
We have a few minutes.
Take the men up top.

689
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:54,069
- Get some air.
- Thankyou. You heard him.

690
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,113
Get some air.

691
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:00,158
- Go, go.
- Lieutenant.

692
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:04,997
- Go on.
- I was getting married.

693
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:07,###
You will.

694
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:10,586
You will.

695
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,013
Your hair falls out,
or something like that.

696
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:25,350
- It won't be that bad.
- Ten minutes is nothing.

697
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:30,230
An hour later and ourwatch
would have been over.

698
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:35,694
It's fate.

699
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,123
- We don't have radiation suits.
- The warehouse was out.

700
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:49,875
They sent us
chemical suits instead.

701
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,504
- They might as well wear raincoats!
- Misha, I know.

702
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:04,139
Tell the men these will help.

703
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,225
What else can we do?

704
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:07,851
Yeah.

705
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,988
It's only ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

706
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:22,783
- Do what you can and get out.
- All right, Anatoly?

707
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:27,746
- Okay?
- Yeah.

708
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:35,379
- It'll be fine.
- Captain.

709
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:43,804
Men.

710
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,850
This difficult task
has fallen to you.

711
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:52,521
Our fate is in your hands.

712
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:56,400
Request permission to carry out
reactor repair, Comrade Captain.

713
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:57,776
Permission granted.

714
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,781
May God be with you.
