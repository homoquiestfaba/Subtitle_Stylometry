1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,526
Live from the front yard

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,237
of Mr. Winchell's
spookily decorated house,

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,574
it's The Paloni Show!
Halloween Special!

4
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,202
Featuring performances
by Philvia Crim,

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,245
Michaels Smith, Tony Shandals,

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,539
Guy Shrunt, Mustard Girl.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,626
And of course, Mr. Winchell
and his one-man puppet show.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,754
And now, please welcome
your favorite hosts...

9
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,839
Leroy Paloni, Reggie Paloni,

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,841
and Cheruce Paloni.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,635
Hey, everybody,

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,553
we, uh, we're the Palonis,
and this is a huge...

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,680
We like specials.
We like hosting specials.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,682
That's like a thing we love
as a family and...

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,268
Yeah, yeah, this is
a big opportunity for us.

16
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,020
- By the way, I'm Reggie.
- Yeah, and I'm Leroy,

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,605
and this is our sister Cheruce.

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,399
And, you know, tonight we have
some great Halloween comedy shorts

19
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,402
we're going to be showing you
along with some incredible performances.

20
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,570
Live right here,

21
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,364
uh, in front
of Mr. Winchell's house.

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,324
Our entire special hosted

23
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,867
in front of this
unimpressive dump.

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,993
Hey, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

25
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,286
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, come on, Cheruce.

26
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,330
She's just a little irritated today.

27
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,749
Hey, I had ideas
for this fuckin' special.

28
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,334
We should have wrote a story.

29
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,002
It's a Halloween special.

30
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,046
It needs practical effects,
gore, suspense.

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,424
Oh, I don't know, maybe somebody
getting stabbed in the fucking face.

32
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,260
That's what Hulu wants, baby.

33
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,886
Who did you talk to
at Hulu, huh?

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,263
Shut the fuck up!

35
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,514
- Okay.
- This was all approved.

36
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,349
Everything behind me
was approved, all of this.

37
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,102
You know what? Why don't
we just get the ball on the road

38
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,062
and check out our first short
of the night.

39
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,296
Uh, here we go.

40
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,527
Hey, Leon,

41
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,904
should I go to the party
as a woodpecker

42
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,823
or a banana?

43
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,490
Dude, banana.

44
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,492
That's what you gotta be.
Chicks love bananas.

45
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,327
- Really?
- Banana it is.

46
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,705
Guess that means I'm stuck
being the woodpecker.

47
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,544
Hey-hey, buddy, check me out.

48
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,778
These chicks are pecking me raw.

49
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,135
Damn it, why'd I choose banana?

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,595
No one likes banana.

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,263
Not much fun in there, is it?

52
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,224
- Oh, totally.
- It's not really my scene.

53
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,185
Me either.

54
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,727
You want to go somewhere
we might fit in?

55
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,730
- Really?
- Sure, yeah. I'd like that.

56
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,359
Wow.

57
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:15,612
A super-exclusive
billionaire party.

58
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,658
I guess being a banana
kind of worked out for me tonight.

59
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,660
I told you we'd fit in.

60
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,828
Come, this way.

61
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,521
They're about to begin
the peeling.

62
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,415
Begin the what now?

63
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,545
Aah!

64
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,658
A a a ah!

65
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:41,012
Uh, this isn't the kind of party
I thought it was.

66
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,722
I, uh, I probably should go.

67
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,807
My friend is likely
wondering where I am.

68
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,935
No, you can't go.

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,436
Not until you peel me.

70
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,188
You want me to peel you?

71
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,213
Yeah, peel me.

72
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,234
This isn't your first
banana party, is it?

73
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,693
No, no, of course not.

74
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,987
I've been
to banana parties before,

75
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,407
so it's not strange at all
for me to peel your skin off.

76
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,746
Not weird, not weird,
not weird at all.

77
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,627
Okay, my turn.

78
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,651
Don't move.

79
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,863
Wait, why do you have
a zipper on your...

80
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,216
Oh no.

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,842
Yeah, uh...

82
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,952
I think there might have been
a miscommunication here.

83
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,721
You have to leave.

84
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,014
You shouldn't be here. Quick.

85
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,039
Halt!

86
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,335
Why hath that banana
still his skin?

87
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,546
The rules are clear.

88
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,192
Or does he think us unworthy

89
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,736
to bear witness to his fruit?

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,822
No, he does not think
you unworthy.

91
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:45,392
Then he must drop
his skin immediately.

92
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,604
Or I will take personal offense.

93
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,206
No offense meant.

94
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,541
I can drop my skin.

95
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,501
I can drop my skin right now,

96
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,525
Dropping my skin.

97
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,152
Ta-da!

98
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,339
As I suspected.

99
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,465
Human.

100
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,992
So, can I go now or what?

101
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,390
- Damn.
- Another clumsy accident.

102
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,726
That's the third banana peel
this week.

103
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,270
When will people start to learn
to watch where they're walking?

104
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,522
I'm not so sure
it was an accident, detective.

105
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,441
I think this whole scene
has been staged.

106
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,901
A murder?

107
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,694
Who would want this kid dead?

108
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,613
I don't know,

109
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:23,096
but you can be damn sure
I'll find out.

110
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,915
Told us th-they liked
the idea of us being

111
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,083
in front of Mr. Winchell's house
for the whole thing.

112
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,168
You don't say anything

113
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,961
unless you read it off
these cards, alright?

114
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,379
You're going to fucking
blow this for us.

115
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,091
Coming up,
Mr. Winchell jerks off his dog.

116
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,302
- That's not what I wrote.
- Come on, Cheruce, cut it out!

117
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,180
I-I-I just want to say this is
a really important opportunity,

118
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,349
and I want to thank Hulu
for believing in us.

119
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,768
It's our goal to make
the best Halloween special ever,

120
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,895
right here in front
of Mr. Winchell's house.

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,396
Remember, they really wanted us

122
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,023
to be in front
of Mr. Winchell's house.

123
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,983
They really li... So I don't know
where this is coming from.

124
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,151
Yep, they called me up
and they told me that too so...

125
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,820
Yeah, and they said it
in the meeting.

126
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:02,946
- They said it twice.
- A couple times.

127
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,490
I mean, you know, they've been
very good partners for us so...

128
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,699
That's... Hey, you know what though?

129
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,992
- That's family, I guess.
- Okay, okay.

130
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,661
Reel it in, guys.
We're fucking live.

131
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,703
Thank you for the note, Cheruce.

132
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,038
But, like, you know, this is the show.

133
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,331
- Oh, I couldn't tell.
- It's fine, Cheruce.

134
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,708
- This is the show.
- It's going exactly as planned.

135
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,252
Where have you guys been?

136
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,213
You promised to take
Little Long-Legs trick or treating!

137
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,465
We're hosting our Halloween Special,
Aunt Stephanie!

138
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,883
- We told you!
- This is important, Stephanie.

139
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,051
Get out of here!

140
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,095
This day couldn't get any worse!

141
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,514
I have never been invited
to a party before

142
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,766
or had any real friends,
and these cool people saw me

143
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,601
in 7-Eleven
and they liked my look.

144
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,186
And now I can't go to their party

145
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,814
because you don't give
a dried-up fuck about your cousin?

146
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,065
You monsters!

147
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,900
You try only having sex once

148
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,528
and then becoming a single mother
with a retarded kid.

149
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,737
- Fuck you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

150
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,030
- Okay...
- Classy, Aunt Stephanie.

151
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,950
Do not use that word
on our Hulu special.

152
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,869
- God, what is wrong with you?
- People are watching at home.

153
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:51,911
So sorry for that.

154
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,163
Great. Here's his costume.

155
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,747
Oh, and by the way,
he has diabetes.

156
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,832
He's got diabetes.

157
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,667
Type two, he did it to himself.

158
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,793
I want candy.

159
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,879
Oh, my God. Okay, calm down,
Little Long-Legs.

160
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,381
Leroy, diabetes is going
to throw off the entire vibe.

161
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,216
I-I don't think they want us
talking about that.

162
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,093
Even if it is his own fault.

163
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,469
I think diabetes type two
is a protected class.

164
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,430
- Well, that's even worse.
- Okay, we should really throw it

165
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,348
to the next... the next short
while we figure this out.

166
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,142
You know what,
you're right, Reggie.

167
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,768
Uh, hey, everybody,
let's check out our next short.

168
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,792
Here we go.

169
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,650
Hey, kids.

170
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,778
Get ready for
Plopsie and Friends!

171
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:31,600
Here's Annie Alphabet
and Captain Colors!

172
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,289
Hey, kids.

173
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,874
Welcome to a very special
Halloween episode.

174
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,293
You know,
Halloween can be spooky,

175
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,597
but it doesn't have to be scary.

176
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,505
Now, let's have a warm welcome

177
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,882
for our favorite
kooky cuddle monster.

178
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,926
It's Plopsie!

179
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,472
Oh, shit.

180
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,349
Whoa, Plopsie, are you okay?

181
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,558
What happened to you?

182
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,292
Hey, never take a swim
in the LA River.

183
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,253
There are portals there.

184
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,274
Okay. Uh, Plopsie,
why don't you tell us

185
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,568
about some of the spookiest things
about Halloween.

186
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,487
Ghosts and ghouls
and goblins, oh my.

187
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,989
- Yeah, you want to know spooky?
- I fell into this fucking portal.

188
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,032
Jesus Christ, Plopsie.

189
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,242
And I saw the future.

190
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,619
You guys better start kissing ass
to the lizard people

191
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,455
'cause I swear to shit
they're taking over.

192
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:19,791
Plopsie, are you okay,
like, medically?

193
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,792
Do you want to maybe go home.

194
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,002
- Me go...
- You fucking go home, I'm fine.

195
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,462
I'm fucking fine.
Let's do this shit.

196
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,714
I've got a date after this.
I'm trying to wrap early.

197
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,716
Okay, Plopsie. Why don't you
tell us about werewolves?

198
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,926
- No, fuck that.
- Alright.

199
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,887
I was playing Marco Polo by myself
in the LA River this morning.

200
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,639
You actually can't do that.

201
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,890
I got sucked
into a vortex, kids,

202
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,183
and the lizard people took me.

203
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,852
They did tests on me.

204
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,103
They mated with me.

205
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,521
Alright, let's talk
about trick or treating.

206
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,714
Long story short,
now I can never die.

207
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,818
It'll be my greatest curse,
right, kids?

208
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,653
I'm having a bad time.

209
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,446
Let's talk about
what's scary on Halloween

210
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,240
that maybe doesn't need
to be so scary.

211
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,284
What is scarier
than what I just told you?

212
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,327
Oh, Captain
Colors, did you hear that sound?

213
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,912
Sounds like
we just got a letter.

214
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,606
In what fucking world does
getting a letter make that sound?

215
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,585
Toby, age five,
from Arkansas says,

216
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,669
"I love Halloween,

217
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,129
"but I'm scared of haunted houses.

218
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,338
What do I do?"

219
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,007
Well, Toby, you have to remember

220
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,051
that everyone in a haunted house
is a person, just like you...

221
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,387
Don't! Let me talk to you
for a second, man-to-man.

222
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:14,930
No!

223
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,974
Toby, I'm going to give you
some coordinates and a machete.

224
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,142
I need you to come here
and kill me.

225
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,768
No, we're not giving Toby
any coordinates.

226
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,103
It may not work the first time,

227
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,022
but I will give you
so many shares of my company

228
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,732
if you just keep chopping.

229
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,192
Plopsie, you have a company?

230
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,651
- I sell used needles.
- You sell them used?

231
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,778
Yeah, but we make it up
in volume, baby!

232
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,802
Okay, uh...

233
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,658
O-okay.

234
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,953
Okay, Kayla M. From Michigan
is seven years old.

235
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,581
Kayla, what poisons
does your daddy have?

236
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,000
Plopsie, I'm going to need you
to stop asking children to kill you.

237
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,293
Also, can you pull your weight?

238
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,753
We're only supposed
to do the intro,

239
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,880
and you're making us steer
this whole thing.

240
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,673
Uh, oh shit, hold that thought.

241
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,717
Uh, my date's waiting for me
in the bathroom.

242
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,927
I gotta wrap this up.

243
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:54,969
In the bathroom?

244
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,245
Yep, handicap stall.

245
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,640
Plopsie's still got it!

246
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,184
- Okay, no, can we...
- Can we roll the song?

247
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,435
Don't you fucking dare, Jeff!

248
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,978
- Please do the song.
- Just roll the song...

249
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,522
- Come on, Je...
- Oh shit, here we go.

250
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,549
- No, no...
- Okay, can we evacuate the kids.

251
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,633
There's going to be a fire.

252
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,284
- Stop, stop.
- Uh-oh.

253
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,619
No. No matches. No!

254
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,008
Okay, the studio's on fire.

255
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,766
Uh, yeah, I'm just...

256
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,502
Everybody follow me outside.

257
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:51,901
Welcome back, folks.

258
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,445
Wow, that was sure was
a fooky, spooky, funny time.

259
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,281
You're darn right it was.

260
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:57,699
That's what's so great
about... the Palonis

261
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:58,825
and, and what we do.

262
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,786
You know, this is why
th-th-this whole thing is so special.

263
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,997
- Well, hey, guess what?
- We're taking this on the road.

264
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,665
That's the news.
That's the big announcement.

265
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,126
Cheruce, is Little Long-Legs
in his costume yet?

266
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,086
Yep.

267
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,004
I'm Tiny Short legs.

268
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,214
Little Long-Legs,
your legs are like your whole shtick.

269
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,341
Why, why would you pick a costume
that doesn't show them off,

270
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,552
you know, like, like show those,
show those bad boys off, baby.

271
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,138
I hate my long legs. I'm ugly!

272
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,057
Oh, come on, you shouldn't be
ashamed of your long legs, little guy.

273
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,976
- Why not?
- They're so long and nasty.

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,227
Shut up, Cheruce!

275
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,188
Be quiet for once.

276
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,564
It's okay. Look, I-I think
your costume is great,

277
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,048
and I think everyone
will love it.

278
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,072
I want candy!

279
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,658
What the fuck are you
supposed to be dressed as?

280
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,035
You fucking piece of shit.

281
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,578
That is so offensive.

282
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,538
It's not the '90s anymore.

283
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,749
You might as well be
in a fucking black face.

284
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,125
Oh, you didn't know
we lived here?

285
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,044
Everybody knows us.

286
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,505
This is targeted bigotry.
This is no accident.

287
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,923
Check out this next short.

288
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,823
At least those are mostly good.

289
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,585
Um, I should take this.

290
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:50,980
Hello.

291
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,189
Hi.
Hey, can I call you back?

292
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,213
I just...

293
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,885
What do you mean
I need to come in?

294
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,469
More testing.

295
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,763
I see. Okay.

296
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,224
Um... thank you.

297
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,037
Had a screening
for cancer last week

298
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,106
and, um, come in for more testing.

299
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,168
That can't be good, right?

300
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,377
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

301
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,503
I mean, how would I even come in?

302
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,287
I mean, I'm stuck
in the middle of the woods.

303
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,177
What's that?

304
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,231
I'm so sorry.

305
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,937
Aah!

306
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,149
Aah.

307
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,640
You're officially cancer free.

308
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,393
Can I just say thank you.

309
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,412
You know, for, for being here with me

310
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,289
at every step
of the way, Rubber Face.

311
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,356
You have...

312
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,378
Oh!

313
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,070
Oh, dear God, please don't...

314
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,090
I have children, please.

315
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,994
It's my oncologist.

316
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,955
Hello.
You know, now it's not the...

317
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,125
What do you mean
I need to come in?

318
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,710
Cancer.

319
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,344
What the fuck.

320
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,659
Th-th-this is a disaster, alright.

321
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,995
This is not the show
that Hulu signed off on, Leroy.

322
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,538
Right now, we should be
smack dab in the middle

323
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,332
of Philvia Crim's
incredible human pretzel routine.

324
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,835
- Where the fuck are we?
- I'm really sorry, folks.

325
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,878
I don't know what to do either, Reggie.

326
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,671
I don't like being
off the rails like this.

327
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,672
Let me just think.

328
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,865
I'm afraid
there's no time to think.

329
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,843
My name is Dr. Toomis.

330
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,553
I work at the local
mental institution

331
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,013
for the criminally insane.

332
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,371
Have you seen this man?

333
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,975
Is that Michael Myers?

334
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,977
No, it's Dana Carvey.

335
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,979
Sorry, no, Dana Carver.

336
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,856
He's wearing a Dana Carvey mask.

337
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,357
Garth from Wayne's World.

338
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,359
His birth name is Dana Carver.

339
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,028
He's my patient.
He escaped.

340
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,906
He carves up his victims
into what can only be described

341
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,449
as human salad.

342
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,867
- Uh, listen, sorry.
- We're not interested.

343
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,785
We don't have any money.

344
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,369
We're trying to host a show here.

345
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,872
Uh, everybody watching at home,
uh, bear with us.

346
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,707
- I'm trying to figure this out.
- No, I'm not homeless.

347
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,752
Dana is carving his way
through this town, please!

348
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,545
I'm warning you and everyone.

349
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,547
My name is Dr. Toomis.

350
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,966
You know, Leroy, I got
a confession to make to you.

351
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,384
I-I-I did have cash on me.

352
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,094
I've, I've got $50 of cash on...

353
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,471
- Keep it.
- He'd just use it on drugs.

354
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,306
Well, yeah, listen, it's, it's...

355
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,641
He'll be fine.
He'll land on his feet.

356
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,559
- You think so?
- Yeah.

357
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,684
I mean, did you see
how he was dressed?

358
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,311
He was dressed better
than me some days.

359
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,188
Yeah, he's probably
got somebody...

360
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,357
Hey, probably some angel
out there looking out for him.

361
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,275
Oh, oh, Leroy.

362
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,651
Watch out for that bowl of body parts.

363
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,903
- Oh geez, thanks, Reggie.
- Almost stepped in it.

364
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,988
Kind of looks like,
I don't know, human salad.

365
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,282
Huh, only on Halloween, right?

366
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,283
Ugh, gross.

367
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,661
Oh, grosser than Guy Shrunt

368
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,247
and his tight five about that
Michael Jackson docu...

369
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,332
- What is a "tight five"?
- It's a comedy term.

370
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,167
The Guy Shrunt
Michael Jackson bit is great.

371
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,086
I... Shut up.

372
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,545
- Doesn't make any sense anymore.
- Leave the cards out of it.

373
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:44,463
- Just forget the cards.
- Fine!

374
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:45,588
You know what?

375
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,714
Leroy, I got an idea.

376
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,258
Why, why don't we throw
to two shorts

377
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,467
instead of, instead of just one short.

378
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,052
- Yeah, okay, that's perfect.
- Two shorts in a row.

379
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,095
Yeah, two shorts. Yeah, yeah.

380
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,347
That's unorthodox for us,
but we're going to do it.

381
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,015
Well, the audience sure must be happy
about hearing that.

382
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,058
Uh, take it away, two shorts.

383
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,643
- Take it away.
- Here you go, two.

384
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,400
Hey, manager.

385
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,693
You're the manager.

386
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:07,944
I have a problem.

387
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,238
My apartment smells
like both piss and shit.

388
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,074
It also smells
a little bit like salami.

389
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,743
But that part I'm okay with!

390
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,811
I got to, um, um, um, um...

391
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,873
inspect the yoga room.

392
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:20,999
Whew!

393
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,127
Man, I don't want to deal
with any problems today.

394
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,336
Reed, thank God you're here.

395
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,796
I have a problem.

396
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,214
Bronwen, unit 403.

397
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,593
Sorry, but I'm, uh,
here to practice, uh, yoga.

398
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,636
Always dodging responsibility.

399
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,971
Remember the broken elevator.

400
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,306
It's been months.

401
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,725
- I fixed that.
- So, you're here for yoga.

402
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,351
Do you even know how to do yoga?

403
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,187
Do I know how to do yoga?

404
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,230
Do I know how to do yoga?

405
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,065
You don't know how
to do yoga, do you?

406
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,067
So I don't know how
to do yoga, is that so?

407
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,843
- No!
- Woo-ha!

408
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,198
Wow, you do know how to do yoga.

409
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,391
This morning,
my neighbor tried to bite me.

410
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,328
I think he's a zombie.

411
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,454
It's Halloween.

412
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,372
Probably just trying to spook you.

413
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,750
- Was he wearing a costume?
- He was nude.

414
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,419
- I've heard enough.
- Sounds like a zombie.

415
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,254
Let me guess,

416
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,088
but you are not going to do
anything about it.

417
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,381
Wrong again.

418
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,383
I'll shoot the motherfucker
in the head.

419
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,222
It's broken.

420
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,681
It's not broken.

421
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,726
Strawberry lime.

422
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,810
Your yogurt.

423
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,436
You can smell that far away?

424
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,980
I can smell the milk
and bacteria.

425
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,107
That's how good
I am at smelling.

426
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,859
- Go ahead, press the button.
- It's broken.

427
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,611
It's not broken. I fixed that...

428
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,790
How the hell
you stay still during all that?

429
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,376
Because there is nothing wrong
with the elevator,

430
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,361
I fixed it, per what I've
been saying this whole time.

431
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,800
- Who is it?
- I'm nude in here.

432
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:54,760
It's Reed.

433
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,928
- Oh please, don't shoot me.
- I'm nude.

434
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,388
You're a zombie...

435
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,597
idiot.

436
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,599
- First, I'm nude.
- Now this.

437
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,561
Ow! My eye.

438
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,962
- That's right.
- Surprise, we're both zombies.

439
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,942
It was our elaborate plan
to lure you up here and eat you.

440
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,611
They'll replace you with a manager
who actually does work around here.

441
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,613
Your management is a disaster,

442
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,408
but soon you'll be
nothing more than a meal.

443
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:19,492
Why is he smiling?

444
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,202
You both fell for my plan.

445
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,205
I knew you were a zombie
the day you moved in.

446
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,167
Smelling your yogurt
was the final proof.

447
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,419
In addition
to strawberry and lime,

448
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,212
I detected gray matter.

449
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,506
Yogurt made from brain.

450
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,134
Oh, and shooting yourself
in the eye was part of your plan?

451
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,136
- It was the perfect distraction.
- Oh!

452
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,470
What did you do to me?

453
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,389
I intentionally left the elevator broken

454
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,057
waiting for this off chance.

455
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,185
And your yogurt was
the perfect receptacle

456
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,394
for the acid that I brought.

457
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,855
But what about me?

458
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,982
I could still eat ya', you know?

459
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,549
Go ahead.

460
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,986
- Is this part of your plan too?
- Eat me.

461
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,155
- What if I don't want to?
- Eat me!

462
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,990
I don't want to!

463
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,233
Ho, ho!

464
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,922
Oh!

465
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,027
Huh?

466
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,903
Hmm?

467
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,965
I told you not to invite Steve!

468
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Oh!

469
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,187
Stop running!

470
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,456
- Oh man, that was great.
- Right, folks?

471
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,790
Sorry, folks at home.

472
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,959
Just as soon as
Little Long-Legs gets his candy,

473
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,295
we'll be back on track
at Mr. Winchell's house in no time.

474
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,130
Uh, yep, yep.

475
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:19,589
That's, that is how
it's going to work.

476
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,799
Would you slow
the fuck down, you little cretin?

477
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,676
All the best houses are up here.

478
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,911
They give us full-size candy bars.

479
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,515
Oh no.

480
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,350
He's headed into the abandoned
Fletcher house, Leroy!

481
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,518
Cheruce! Catch him!

482
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,312
- I'm trying, goddammit.
- He's too fast.

483
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,898
Cheruce, you, you idiot!

484
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,608
He's, he's in this
fucking nightmare house now.

485
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,443
- Fuck you, Reggie.
- Get off my back.

486
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,611
Hey guys, listen. We...

487
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,321
Let's just keep it together, okay?

488
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,365
L-L-Leroy, we should probably
just throw it to the next short.

489
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,783
- Just throw it to the next short.
- Uh, okay, yeah.

490
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,203
Um, everybody, buckle in
for the next Halloween short.

491
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,412
Take it away.

492
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,710
Goddammit,

493
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,587
- the cupboards are bare.
- What's that?

494
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:03,132
Vegan foie gras, expired in 2014.

495
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,217
Yeah, I'm so hungry.

496
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,553
Stupid fucking demanding bodies.

497
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,931
Oh, what sort of gum is that?

498
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:12,642
Yeah, it smells really good.

499
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,185
Oh yeah.

500
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,271
Oh yeah, fuck.

501
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,022
So fucking hungry.

502
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,858
Oh, God.

503
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,526
Dude, back off.

504
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,735
Oh geez, Owl.

505
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,280
You don't gotta be
such a fucking homophobe, man.

506
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,782
Just trying to smell
your mouth, for fuck's sake. God.

507
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,743
Owl, you must have some cash
hidden away up your boring ass.

508
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,704
Please, we're starving.

509
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:34,205
Well, first of all, Mogg,
go fuck yourself.

510
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,206
And secondly,

511
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,292
I told you I got fired from my job

512
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,419
because somebody
hacked my Twitter.

513
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,713
Owl, how many times
do I have to apologize?

514
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,339
I'm sorry.

515
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,175
I was very high.

516
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,593
Oh hey, I got it.

517
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,011
Let's go trick or treating.

518
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,889
- What?
- Werewolf Jones, we're in our 30s.

519
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:51,890
No, come on, come on.

520
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:55,101
L-listen, let's get all dolled up
and go out begging, right?

521
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,603
What's the worst that could happen?

522
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,229
Here, I'll rack up a few lines.

523
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,064
Okay. This, this.

524
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,941
Pretty good.

525
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,343
Oh yeah.
There you go, have at it.

526
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,678
Meet you outside in five.

527
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,701
Ooh, Megg, sexy witch.

528
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,478
Yep, figured I may as well
completely debase myself.

529
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,164
Frank-n-furter?

530
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,707
Uh, yeah, time warp.

531
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,000
Alright, let's do this.

532
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,585
Owl, what the fuck, dude.

533
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,170
Did you all just go
through my laundry?

534
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,954
I'm going to have to burn
all that stuff now.

535
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,948
Whatever, let's do this.

536
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,036
Ah, nobody home.

537
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,097
Hey, look, the window's open.

538
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:35,748
Come on.

539
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,710
Okay, well, this quickly devolved.

540
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,898
Fuck, It's dark in here, right?

541
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:42,982
Where's the kitchen?

542
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,692
I smell food.
Beef!

543
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:45,836
Through here.

544
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,096
Holy shit!

545
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,492
Run. Owl, come on.

546
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,452
Oh, my fucking face.

547
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,954
- Where's Jones?
- They got him.

548
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,580
They fucking got him.
He's dead.

549
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,915
- Oh, God.
- What are we going to do?

550
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,751
Oh, I think I might have
to go to the hospital.

551
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,127
Oh.

552
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,463
Ugh, Owl, that's disgusting!

553
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,674
- Dude, put a bag on your face.
- We don't want to look at that.

554
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:08,938
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

555
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,886
- Who's that?
- That was a fucking cop-knock.

556
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,179
Let's get out of here.

557
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,203
Where?

558
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,975
Megg, where are we going?

559
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,393
We'll steal a boat
from the marina.

560
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,751
We're sea-people now.

561
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,964
Guys, guys, let me in.

562
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,610
I left the rest
of my coke in there.

563
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,634
I need a bump.

564
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:35,767
Okay, I think we're
in international waters.

565
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,079
I'm cold.

566
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,622
Here, let's do some more lines.

567
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,040
Oh.

568
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,193
I hate you guys so fucking much.

569
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,801
- Little Long-Legs!
- Little Long-Legs!

570
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:52,844
- Little Long-Legs!
- Where are you?

571
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:53,970
- Where is he?
- Where are you?

572
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,054
Where you at, Little long-Legs?

573
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,765
- He can't hear you, shit bag.
- He has diabetes.

574
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,475
Just a minor hiccup here, folks.

575
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,644
We'll be back on track
in, in just a minute.

576
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:02,854
I can't believe this, Leroy.

577
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,731
- I, I can't believe this.
- I know. It's insane.

578
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,483
It's worse than insane, it's...

579
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,026
Listen, we're going to find him

580
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,694
and get out of this house.

581
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,070
I hope so, I hope so.

582
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,947
If not, I'm just saying, if not...

583
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,265
- We will.
- Come on, let's fucking go.

584
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,827
The homeless guy.

585
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,287
How the hell did he get
ahead of us?

586
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,538
- I don't know.
- Look at his calves.

587
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,081
I mean, th-this guy, this guy runs.

588
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,732
Look at 'em.
This guy definitely runs.

589
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,254
Human salad!

590
00:25:29,072 --> 00:25:31,716
You kids are going to look
so much better

591
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,428
topped with croutons
and Parme-sian cheese.

592
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,263
Oh, my fucking God,
we're going to die.

593
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,997
- Just run!
- Holy fuck!

594
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,267
He's, like, right behind me.

595
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,727
Everybody at home,
just, just check out

596
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,729
this next short
while we figure this out.

597
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,447
Surprise!

598
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,578
Jesus H. Christ, guys.

599
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:01,687
What the fuck?

600
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,123
Jesus.

601
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:04,999
I almost had a heart attack.

602
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,316
Come on, man.

603
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,712
I walk into a room
and you yell, "Surprise!"

604
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:10,736
Fuck you.

605
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,549
Fuck you.

606
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:13,925
Fuck all of you guys.

607
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,493
You and you and you
and you and you.

608
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,976
I haven't watched
that footage in a long time.

609
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,563
It's still very hard to watch.

610
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:30,174
That was 50 years ago, tonight.

611
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,886
Half a century, lot of water
under the bridge.

612
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,096
Yeah, that was my birthday party.

613
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,909
More scared than I have
ever been in my life,

614
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,077
before or since.

615
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,204
I hope nobody watching this ever

616
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,981
has to feel the level of terror

617
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,126
that I felt that night.

618
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,818
I felt unsafe.

619
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,778
Very unsafe

620
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,174
and terrified.

621
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:58,761
What those people did to me
at that party was terror-ism,

622
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,412
because they terrified me.

623
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,730
Ever since that night,
that fateful night, uh, uh,

624
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,024
Mr. Mayor plans
his own birthday parties.

625
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,485
Uh, Teresa has been
removed from that duty,

626
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,487
right, Teresa? Right?

627
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:16,405
Right, Teresa?

628
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:18,198
Honey?

629
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,240
Dear?

630
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,868
Because of the sheer,
unadulterated fear

631
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,286
that I felt that night,

632
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,164
I was able
to implement legislation

633
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,709
that I called
the "Carefree Scare-Free bill."

634
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,819
It's a bill that I brought into law

635
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,242
that says that nothing scary
can ever happen here again.

636
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:41,012
It's been that way for 50 years.

637
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,830
Nothing will scare you
in Right behind you ton.

638
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,498
Count on it.

639
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,770
- No skeletons?
- No.

640
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:49,771
- Vampire teeth?
- No.

641
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:50,814
- Fake blood?
- No!

642
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,315
- Fake skeletons?
- No!

643
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,650
Ma'am, you're going
to want to cooperate

644
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:54,568
if you want to get into town.

645
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,528
- I am co-operating.
- Come on through.

646
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:57,946
Ha, keep going.

647
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,782
Hey, Neil, I checked these ones
last night, they're okay.

648
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:01,783
What was that?

649
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,660
Her, I'm not so sure about,

650
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:04,661
check the trunk.

651
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,704
Well, you see, my family's run
this pumpkin farm

652
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,122
for over a century, yeah.

653
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,166
You know,
about five generations or so.

654
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,918
It wasn't until
about 50 years ago

655
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,212
with the passing of
the "Carefree Scare-Free Act"

656
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,297
that we had to start
paintin' the suckers.

657
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,592
Blue, red, indigo.

658
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,345
Can't do orange though,
because orange is the scary kind.

659
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,472
Also, we gotta coat 'em
in this here resin,

660
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:25,849
at least one to two inches thick

661
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,059
so no one goes around carving
any scary faces

662
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,083
into the suckers.

663
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:31,856
Mm.

664
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,690
You know, I've been called
to armed robberies.

665
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,567
I've been in high-speed chases.

666
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:38,361
I've been involved loosely
in sexual stuff

667
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,655
that is a little out
of my comfort zone.

668
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,490
Mm-hmm.

669
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,074
Nothing prepares you for this.

670
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,826
Couple of these slip through
every year,

671
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,269
but, uh, we always catch 'em.

672
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,356
Neil, can we get this
covered up please?

673
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,670
So, Halloween,
obviously, that's out.

674
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,463
And guess what?
We don't miss it.

675
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,215
Because what's Halloween about?

676
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,301
What do people like
about Halloween?

677
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,595
Well, people like dressing up.

678
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,138
Hey, that's a great costume.

679
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,723
Who you dressed as
this Mayor Day?

680
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,558
I dressed as the mayor.

681
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,455
I should have known that.

682
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,272
You look wonderful.
You look great.

683
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,566
And so does your mom
and so does your dad.

684
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,258
- Thank you.
- Family of mayors.

685
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:20,945
You don't like Halloween?

686
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,473
Come here and celebrate
Mayor Day with us.

687
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,576
Just wear one of these,

688
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,640
'cause that's what I wear.

689
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,625
- Thank you!
- Miss Micelli, you sent a wonderful...

690
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,067
I'm proud of you too.

691
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,128
- Thank you.
- I love you back.

692
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,152
Fellow citizens,

693
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,072
family...

694
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:41,717
friends.

695
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,595
I am so pleased and proud
to be here with you

696
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:50,391
celebrating our 50th Mayor Day
here in this town.

697
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:54,145
The people who were
in attendance at that party

698
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,981
on that night
are also here tonight.

699
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,025
Most of them are still with us,

700
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,653
so let's give them
a rousing round of applause.

701
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,656
- Thank you. You're too kind.
- Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

702
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,784
You guys gave me the biggest scare
of my life back then,

703
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,410
but you also gave me

704
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,121
the greatest idea
of my life back then

705
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,623
and you get...

706
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:16,417
What's happening?
Oh, my God, what?

707
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,294
What's happening?

708
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,318
What's happening?

709
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:27,929
No, no, no.

710
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,557
Yes! Yes!

711
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,335
Gotcha, bitches!

712
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,063
Why are you laughing?

713
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,816
You fell for the old
"town where nothing scary happens"

714
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,592
for 50 years trick.

715
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,220
- Yes! Yes!
- What?

716
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,449
Yeah, scared, Teresa?

717
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,243
I want a divorce, tonight!

718
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:52,745
Neil, serve her the papers.
Ha, ha!

719
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:53,997
Bye!

720
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,623
Oh, Teresa, I'm sorry.

721
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,750
Halloween is back!

722
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,627
Goodbye, Mayor Day!

723
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,462
Hello, Halloween!

724
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,160
- Little Long-Legs!
- Cheruce, grab him!

725
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,805
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

726
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,016
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth as it...

727
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Holy shit!

728
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,768
Oh shit.
I fucking hate this.

729
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,187
What's this guy's
fucking problem?

730
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:18,891
I don't know,
I don't know what the fuck...

731
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,692
Run, run, run! Hurry!
What the fuck is this?

732
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,801
Come over here
and get against the wall.

733
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,950
- We're going to die!
- We're going to die!

734
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,327
We can't die on camera.

735
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,496
That was part
of the contract with Hulu.

736
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,040
Um, everybody, just watch this.

737
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,273
Take, take it away.

738
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,963
Don't listen to the lies.

739
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,757
No one does meat anymore.

740
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,509
Eating animals is wrong.

741
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:48,968
People taste better.

742
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,432
The only true
cannibal restaurant for miles.

743
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,726
Family business since years ago.

744
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,686
Never chewy ligaments.

745
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,398
My name is The Owner,
and I don't mess around.

746
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:05,318
You want rotten dogs?
Go and see my competitors.

747
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,446
A prime selection of young meat.

748
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,115
Ethically sourced.

749
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,367
I'm Jason.

750
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:15,078
And if you are watching this,
I'm already dead.

751
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,162
I was eaten at...

752
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,413
Clacky's!

753
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,290
By the cream of society

754
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,834
and so can you be.

755
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,127
Ten thousand likes guaranteed.

756
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,463
And just look at
these stunning babes.

757
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:26,673
Never work again.

758
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:30,218
I've seen the apocalypse,
and now I'm ready for God.

759
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:34,097
Life isn't great until you're famous
for an hour or so.

760
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,934
And once someone here
was eaten by a famous rapper.

761
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,252
Got a six-figure T-shirt deal.

762
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,280
Good evening.
Welcome to Clacky's.

763
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,739
Thank you, come in.

764
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,283
Take a seat.
Have a go and have a seat.

765
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,160
You'll have a good time.

766
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:55,368
Aya!

767
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,204
Go and have a check
on tonight's star guest.

768
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,229
Okay, Dad.

769
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,000
Um, hi.

770
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,609
Uh, are you alright?

771
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,503
All, all set to go?

772
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,422
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah, I'm ready.

773
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:08,340
I'm ready for death.

774
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,884
I can't wait to shake God's hand

775
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,094
and say good work, old chap.

776
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,637
Can I, can I get you anything?

777
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,599
Um, a can of pop or an orange?

778
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,892
Well, it may seem strange,

779
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,685
but may I meet my slaughterer?

780
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,479
Oh yeah, yeah, of course.

781
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:23,587
Clarence!

782
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,648
Well, hello there.

783
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,693
Yes, you must be
tonight's slab of gristle.

784
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,361
Don't worry, I'm gentle.

785
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,363
I, I assumed you'd be human.

786
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,140
Yes, well,
it's a legal loophole.

787
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,995
Guh... Do you have a reservation?

788
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,872
You took my boy away.

789
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:42,415
I know he agreed to it,

790
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,042
but you took him out of this world

791
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,252
and fed him
to vultures and beasts.

792
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,046
Madam, please.

793
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,048
We do not serve vultures here.

794
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:52,592
We serve the highest of society.

795
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,302
Your son died for a good cause.

796
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:55,512
You did him in.

797
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,597
You slaughtered his carcass
for profit.

798
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:00,308
Well, he did willingly
go through the application.

799
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:03,686
And you promised him
10,000 likes on his socials.

800
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,522
And I know it's only been
a few weeks,

801
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,006
but this is nowhere near 10,000.

802
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,485
Could you, uh,
possibly do another retweet?

803
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,654
Sure, okay, great, no problem.

804
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,405
And, and my Instagram.

805
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,618
I want mine cooked alive, mommy.

806
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:20,453
I want to taste its fear.

807
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,121
Will they serve babies?

808
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,415
I hope they have some baby
on the menu tonight.

809
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,376
- Yes, dear, I'm sure they will.
- I'm sure.

810
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,919
Ladies and gentlemen,

811
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:30,672
tonight's main course is Nigel.

812
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,340
He wanted to be an engineer,

813
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,593
but it seemed like a lot of hard work,
and nobody likes that.

814
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:40,265
So tonight, he cuts his life short
to serve you, our finest.

815
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:44,144
But before he is butchered,
he'd love to meet you all.

816
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,836
So, bring him out.

817
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:48,606
Uh, one moment, chaps.

818
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,860
I will just check
and see where he is.

819
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,362
Aah! Get me out of here,
I've changed my mind!

820
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:54,989
You better let me go.

821
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:56,656
Why isn't he tranquilized?

822
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,533
Um, Lady Fridgely called ahead

823
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:01,369
and she requested
untranquilized meat tonight.

824
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,954
Well, you still do it.

825
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,956
- Please don't let me die.
- Come here, boy.

826
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,791
Let me slice you into pieces.

827
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,395
No, not out there.

828
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:11,296
Oh, my God.

829
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,630
It's a beetle.
What is that doing here?

830
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,383
To think such creatures
handle the food.

831
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,076
- Oh, come on.
- He's one of the good ones.

832
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:21,038
Dinner has escaped.

833
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,349
But la-ladies
and gentlemen, hold on,

834
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:27,920
but don't leave because, uh,
we have some backup meat.

835
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,088
Oh no, man.

836
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,798
What's going on?

837
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,218
I can't handle this, man.

838
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,330
No, it's the only
haunted house in the city.

839
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,207
Oh, hey, everybody.

840
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,957
We escaped the killer
by the thick of our teeth.

841
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,000
Thin of our teeth.

842
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,002
The good news is,
the police are on their way.

843
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:52,212
I think we're,
I think we're going to be alright.

844
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,130
It's the abandoned Fletcher house.

845
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,090
We're in the closet
in a creepy old trophy room,

846
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:57,366
you fucking idiot.

847
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,553
Leroy, the 911 lady says
we gotta stay really quiet,

848
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,764
so do you think Hulu
would be mad or upset

849
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:05,391
if we had a part of the special
with mostly whispering?

850
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,894
No, I want candy!

851
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,938
Shut the fuck up,
you're going to get us killed.

852
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:13,048
No, let go of me, I want candy!

853
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:14,925
Shut the... be quiet.

854
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,031
Holy fucking shit!

855
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,574
Nooo!

856
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:22,451
Come on, let's go!

857
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:23,475
Why is this happening?

858
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,310
Come on, hurry.

859
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:31,835
Everybody, just take a look at this next,
really funny Halloween short.

860
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:39,783
So, Nugget, I heard you've got
a date with a girl tonight.

861
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:40,928
Yep.

862
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:43,721
Oh, that's,
that's fucking awesome, man.

863
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,390
A real girl, aye?

864
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:46,641
Ha ha, good on ya.

865
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,185
Yep. Going to try
and have sex with her.

866
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,728
Oh, are you serious, man?

867
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,272
Oh, that's so cool.

868
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,940
I'm so happy for you, eh.

869
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,066
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks, mate.

870
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,527
It's like,
it's like the 57th date.

871
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,736
So, yeah,

872
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,888
feeling pretty good
about it, yeah.

873
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:04,099
Wait, this is the 57th date?

874
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:05,452
Yeah.

875
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:09,747
Yeah, 57 or 56 or in
the mid-50s, somewhere.

876
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:10,939
Yeah, about that.

877
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,625
Oh, okay.

878
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:16,629
And... and you haven't, like,
done anything with her or nothing yet?

879
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,448
Well, I mean,
we've... I've... we've like,

880
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,217
we've, like, eat... we've talk...

881
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,784
We've talked and...

882
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:24,387
Yeah, sure.

883
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,222
And we went to dinner and stuff.

884
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,599
Yeah, we've done that stuff.

885
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,809
Okay. Yeah, no that's,
that's cool.

886
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,561
Yeah.

887
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:33,062
- Um, you have...
- You haven't, like, kissed her

888
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,814
or held her hand or nothing?

889
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,358
Well, I mean, not specifically.

890
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,735
No, we haven't done that,

891
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:42,489
but we have,
we have had sushi together and...

892
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:43,990
Yeah, dinners and stuff. Yeah.

893
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,617
Like I say, we've talked.

894
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,784
So, I mean,

895
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,244
we're, you know,
we're getting there.

896
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,205
We're working up to it.

897
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:51,331
- Yeah, okay.
- So, you... you're like... you're not...

898
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,833
You don't want to rush into anything
basically, is what you're saying.

899
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:54,668
Yeah. I mean...

900
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:57,587
Yeah, you just never know
in this day and age, you know.

901
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,964
Like the whole "me too" era
and everything.

902
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,133
You gotta just be
a bit careful, don't you?

903
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,718
Can't just go full on.

904
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:04,969
No, I, I get you.

905
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,055
Yeah, you just, just want
to take it slowly, don't you?

906
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,641
- Just take it slow.
- Just, you know, see what happens.

907
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,267
Just, you know, go with the flow.

908
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,769
Well, I mean, the good thing is

909
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,063
she probably appreciates that,
doesn't she?

910
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:18,316
That you're not, you're not one
of these guys that just wants sex.

911
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,527
- Well, that, you know, that...
- Yeah, that is how I see it.

912
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,197
I just, I want her to know
that I respect her enough,

913
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,890
that I don't, I don't think about that.

914
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,434
Yeah, you don't think about it?

915
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:33,206
I mean, yes, I do,
but I, I want her to think

916
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,707
I don't think about that.

917
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:35,501
- Yeah.
- If that makes sense.

918
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:37,627
- No, that does make...
- Yeah, that makes sense.

919
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:38,711
I think she'd appreciate that.

920
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,046
Yeah, well, I think so.

921
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,422
And, you know, like I say,

922
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,967
something about tonight
just feels right.

923
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,719
Feels like something
could happen finally, you know?

924
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,972
- Yeah. Well, yeah.
- Good luck to you, mate.

925
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,956
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm rooting for ya'

926
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,892
to have a root.

927
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:56,896
You get it?
Like, have a root. Like, sex.

928
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,482
- Oh, you know I get it!
- Yeah, oh no, I get it!

929
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,442
No, I get it!

930
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,527
- You like that, yeah?
- You'd have a root.

931
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,136
No, no, I get it.

932
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,614
Yeah, no, just a little bit of,

933
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,890
just a bit of fun.

934
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,243
Well, Happy Halloween, mate.

935
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:11,661
- Oh, yeah.
- It is Halloween, isn't it?

936
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,663
- I forgot.
- Yeah, 31st of October.

937
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,165
Oh yeah, yeah.

938
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,541
- Yeah, cheers.
- Yeah, thanks, mate.

939
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:17,565
Good luck to ya'.

940
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,611
Oh!

941
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,842
- Mr. Stuffy!
- There's no time.

942
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,177
Cheruce, stay with me.

943
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,821
Boo lie Doom Bah Lo! Oolie Bahlah!

944
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,449
Give me the power, I beg of you!

945
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:52,160
He's doing a Child's Play!

946
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,435
Shoot him harder!

947
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,917
Boo lie... boo... balah!

948
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,547
Alright, boys.

949
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,716
I think we served
enough justice here.

950
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,302
Officers, if you don't mind,
my sister really needs help.

951
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,637
Officers, be advised,

952
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,556
the suspect of the third street
trash can graffiti has escaped

953
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,266
and is currently
impersonating an officer.

954
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,392
He could be any one of us.

955
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,852
This is scary, this is serious.

956
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,036
Proceed with caution, fellas.

957
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:22,089
Uh, Leroy, I think
we should get out of here.

958
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,111
I don't know if you can hear me

959
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:27,904
over these loud gunshots,
everybody,

960
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,949
but check out this next
Halloween short.

961
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,061
Uh-huh.

962
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:38,981
And yep...

963
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:41,209
Wow, if I don't say so myself,

964
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,943
this is looking pretty good.

965
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,380
- Hey!
- Ah!

966
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:46,673
- Yeah, hey.
- You with the tweezers.

967
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,050
Oh, hello.

968
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,135
- Yeah, I know.
- Weird, right?

969
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,804
Little man living in your model town

970
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,180
or whatever this thing is.

971
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:56,099
But hey, today's your lucky day.

972
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,810
'Cause I can make
all your dreams come true!

973
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,229
Anything you ever wanted
or wished for,

974
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:02,730
I could make it happen!

975
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,024
All you gotta do is say
my name three times.

976
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:08,069
- Wow, yeah.
- Uh, okay, what's your name?

977
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,196
Well, that's the thing.

978
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,614
I can't say it.

979
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,325
So, uh, h-how's this work?

980
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,162
- Do I have to guess or what...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

981
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,329
- What's...
- Uh...

982
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:18,998
How am I going to know it?

983
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:20,206
Oh. Okay, here.

984
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,815
Take this, here you go.

985
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,734
Okay. Let's see.

986
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,963
I can't say that.

987
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,323
- Come on, what's the big deal?
- It's my name.

988
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:31,594
What are you trying to say?

989
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:33,303
That's, that's,
that's what they call me, man.

990
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,138
That's my name.

991
00:41:34,162 --> 00:41:36,222
- Okay.
- Well, just to be clear,

992
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,142
I say this horrible,
horrible thing...

993
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,478
- Uh-huh.
- ...and then I get whatever I want.

994
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,396
- Yeah, yeah.
- Anything, infinite wishes.

995
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,356
Yep, right. Yeah.

996
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,941
But, uh, you gotta say,
you gotta say it in a crowd.

997
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,651
Yeah, at the top of your lungs.

998
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,487
Gah...

999
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:50,488
Three times.

1000
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,721
Yeah, or it doesn't work at all.

1001
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,119
Okay.

1002
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,746
- You... you're go...
- Yeah?

1003
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,414
Yeah, why not?

1004
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:02,523
I'm going to go do it.

1005
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,045
Attention, everybody.

1006
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:10,614
I have something
to say three times.

1007
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,259
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1008
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:14,886
It's working, it's working.

1009
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,554
Ay-yay-yay.

1010
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,389
Ooh. He's coming back,
he's coming back.

1011
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:23,728
You said it?
You actually said it?

1012
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,313
Oh, you idiot.

1013
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,440
You can't go around
saying shit like that.

1014
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,276
But you said you were going to make
all my dreams come true.

1015
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,153
- No, no.
- Fuck no, man.

1016
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,113
You're crazy.

1017
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:34,781
You think I'm going to help you?

1018
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,741
Fuck you.
I think you're a shitwad.

1019
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,993
- You said...
- And you're ugly.

1020
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,453
I don't even want
to be seen with you.

1021
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:41,704
What have I done?

1022
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:44,040
Oh, my God. What an idiot.

1023
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,583
Alright, I'm, I'm done with this.

1024
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:46,733
I'm going inside.

1025
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:50,046
What am I going to do
with all these bottles?

1026
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,967
Cheruce, can you hear me?

1027
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:54,844
Say something.

1028
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:56,678
Welcome back, folks.

1029
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:59,806
Let's check out
the incredible finger painting

1030
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,975
of Tony Shandles.

1031
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,019
Le-Leroy,
she-she's going to be okay, right?

1032
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:07,129
She's... she's gone.

1033
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,983
Okay, at least she's safe
in hell now, you know.

1034
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:10,818
Oh, my God.

1035
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,569
Oh... Oh, my God.

1036
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,028
Okay, okay. No, wow.

1037
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,697
No, it's rea...
It's sinking in now, Leroy.

1038
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,282
It's, it's hitting me.
It's all real.

1039
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,658
This must be what
rock bottom looks like.

1040
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,326
I fucking quit!

1041
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,870
Fuck you, fuck Hulu!

1042
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:23,830
Fuck Halloween
and fuck the police!

1043
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:25,707
I, I, I can't do it, Leroy.

1044
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,083
I can't host the show anymore.

1045
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,334
Me neither, we're done.

1046
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,712
You know, I guess
the show won't go on.

1047
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,464
You know, we blew our shot with Hulu.
It doesn't even matter.

1048
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:34,591
It's over.

1049
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,301
I want Mr. Stuffy!

1050
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:37,385
You fucking monster.

1051
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:40,096
You got the special ruined
and you killed Cheruce.

1052
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,931
Okay, Leroy, take it easy.

1053
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:43,016
Here's what we're going to do.

1054
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,143
I'm calling Aunt Stephanie.
Her party is over.

1055
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,729
We gotta get rid of this kid
before we hurt him.

1056
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,022
I'm going to hurt him, Leroy.

1057
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:50,398
I can feel it
building inside me.

1058
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:51,399
I'm going to hurt him.

1059
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,525
Hi, you've reached Stephanie.

1060
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:53,444
I'm not here, bye.

1061
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:54,508
This can't be happening.

1062
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,155
- Is this real?
- No, fuck that, alright.

1063
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,698
We're going to go
drop him off at the party.

1064
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,867
Hey, Siri, locate Aunt Stephanie.

1065
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,076
Wait, what?

1066
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,228
It says she's right there.

1067
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,207
Alright, look, Leroy, here's,
here's what's going to happen.

1068
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:08,583
We're going to throw it
to the next short.

1069
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,293
And then we're going to drop
this little bastard off

1070
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:11,086
and be done with him.

1071
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,545
He's a fucking piece of shit.

1072
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,214
And I'm sick
of pretending he's not.

1073
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:16,549
I'm, I'm really sorry
about this, Hulu.

1074
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm trying to come to terms
with this right now.

1075
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:21,179
I'm pretty sure I'm in shock.

1076
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,181
Th-th-this is not the show
we wanted to make.

1077
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:25,767
This is not the special
we wanted to do.

1078
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,018
My sister's dead.

1079
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,062
She's, she's gone.

1080
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:30,396
Cheruce is gone.

1081
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,024
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1082
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:36,069
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's check out the...

1083
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:37,445
Just throw it to the next...

1084
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,155
Just play the thing.
Just play, whatever...

1085
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,490
- I'm freaking out!
- Play it.

1086
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,497
Ladies and gentlemen,

1087
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,166
a strange tale
you're about to behold.

1088
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,168
This story is just the beginning.

1089
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,920
The beginning of the end
of the world.

1090
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:54,921
I'm going to be a hero.

1091
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,631
Exclaimed the bold young man,

1092
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,091
forgetting that unrequited love

1093
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,218
had broken
his frail young heart.

1094
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,470
- Johnny!
- Johnny, come, it's urgent!

1095
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:04,347
Called his mother
in a very urgent tone.

1096
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,557
I'm on my way!

1097
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,016
He said forgetting that the world

1098
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,518
was going to end that day.

1099
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,312
A pair of aliens
from outer space arrived

1100
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,439
to take over and humanity erase.

1101
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:14,506
Literally.

1102
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:18,319
Then they zapped a cat
crawling on the floor,

1103
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,030
believing it was a man
walking on all fours.

1104
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,825
Then they zapped a tree
from their spaceship in the air.

1105
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:24,868
Because we were convinced...

1106
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,911
It was a man with bushy hair.

1107
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,646
So they landed in a tub
and they met an old lady.

1108
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:31,749
This one is actually a human.

1109
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:33,567
Let's turn her into gravy.

1110
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,486
So the Armageddon started.

1111
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,214
Here I am.

1112
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,215
Mom?

1113
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,633
The boy said immediately,

1114
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,951
forgetting who had called him
in the first place.

1115
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:46,598
He couldn't remember his mother
or why he was in the bathroom again.

1116
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,934
All the memories erased
from his young and chubby brain.

1117
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,436
Suddenly the plot thickens

1118
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,563
and one of
the Martians disappeared.

1119
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,255
Zap! Like the dickens.

1120
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:03,198
I feel very confused,
I thought I had a friend,

1121
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,974
but now it's just me,
I'm all alone in the end.

1122
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,203
- This amorphous...
- And viscous.

1123
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:10,330
...and viscous blob
swallows the memory

1124
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,123
of things thrown in there.

1125
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:13,500
For example,
if I throw in a comb,

1126
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:15,585
people will forget what it's like
to comb their hair.

1127
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,337
Ah, then I'm going
to throw in my cap

1128
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,463
so that people will forget it.

1129
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:21,341
Then I'm going to invent it myself
to make a lot of money.

1130
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:22,259
Then I call the girl I like,

1131
00:46:22,283 --> 00:46:23,510
and then she's going to fall
in love with me.

1132
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:24,470
But then Johnny remembered

1133
00:46:24,494 --> 00:46:25,678
that he wanted to be a hero.

1134
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:26,555
I'm going to be a hero!

1135
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,264
By throwing
all guns into the blob.

1136
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:29,807
Then all wars would go to zero.

1137
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:31,184
Nope, I don't want to do that.

1138
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,584
No, I don't.

1139
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,315
Hey Johnny, you're adopted.

1140
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,466
That's why when
your mother disappeared, you didn't.

1141
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,741
This, this seems pretty quiet
for a party, doesn't it?

1142
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,034
Yeah, wait till
Aunt Stephanie sees

1143
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:49,685
what her son did to Cheruce.

1144
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,123
Help!

1145
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,084
Mama.

1146
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:56,793
Aunt Stephanie,
why are you all tied up?

1147
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,503
Look at Cheruce, she's dead.

1148
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,338
Those cool people I met
at the 7-Eleven

1149
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:02,340
turned out to be cultists
who are killing people

1150
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:05,009
because they think
it'll open this box.

1151
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,221
I should have known
when cool people invited me to a party

1152
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,181
that it was too good to be true.

1153
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:12,016
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1154
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:16,312
How nice of you
to join our little party.

1155
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,106
Tie them up!

1156
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,648
And throw that body on the pile

1157
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,358
with the other failed attempts.

1158
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,193
Three more victims to kill.

1159
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:24,988
Three more scratches
at the lottery ticket

1160
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,557
that is summoning
the great demon Turvok.

1161
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,661
I want my Stuffy back.

1162
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:32,413
Fuck, Leroy.

1163
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:34,497
I did not think this night
could get any worse,

1164
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:36,249
but, but it just did.
It just happened.

1165
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:37,709
Maybe this is all just a bad dream,

1166
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:41,212
and everything will be back to normal
after this next short.

1167
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:01,774
Welcome.

1168
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,842
This is my house of horrors.

1169
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:06,178
Come and have a look around,
why don't you?

1170
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:10,366
No, no, no, no.
That's a baby.

1171
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,785
Baby does not belong
in the microwave...

1172
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:16,646
Huh?

1173
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:19,764
Come here.

1174
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:23,402
Huh?

1175
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,595
Uh-oh.

1176
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,182
Time for a spot of gardening.

1177
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:57,688
You're in trouble now.

1178
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:00,398
Ugh.

1179
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,530
Hey, my baby!

1180
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,176
Hey, I'm coming!

1181
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:15,955
Ah.

1182
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:18,208
These guys need taking out.

1183
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,170
Got one.

1184
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:26,966
Got one.

1185
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:45,652
Do you want to see
what I keep under my bed?

1186
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,823
Yo ink.

1187
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:55,847
Come here, you little monkey.

1188
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:57,265
That was a close one. Huh?

1189
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:02,084
Whoa!

1190
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:11,929
Ohh.

1191
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:38,097
Aliens tried to put baby in microwave.

1192
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,933
- Again?
- Again.

1193
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:45,104
Well, maybe the stab and toss thing

1194
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:46,815
isn't going to be
what summons Turvok.

1195
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:47,691
I totally agree.

1196
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:50,235
Well, I'm pitching the body works
exhibit-type thing.

1197
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:51,277
Cut 'em up, fillet them out.

1198
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,113
Nice! It sounds gorgeous,
but it's pretty involved.

1199
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:55,365
I mean, they get professionals
to do that.

1200
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,325
- You're saying I can't do it?
- What, I'm not good enough?

1201
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,953
I'm not saying
you couldn't do it, eventually.

1202
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:01,913
It's just as a friend, you tend...

1203
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:03,248
Sorry, folks.

1204
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:04,166
This isn't a dream,

1205
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,501
it's more of
a fucking nightmare.

1206
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:09,462
Leroy, I think I just put
something together.

1207
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:12,465
You know,
all this gore and violent death.

1208
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:16,052
Right, right? And Cheruce
getting stabbed in her fucking face.

1209
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:17,971
Oh, my God.

1210
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:21,349
That's what Cheruce said
a good Halloween special would have.

1211
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,977
- Is, is this special?
- Is it good?

1212
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,271
Yeah, yeah.
I think maybe, yeah.

1213
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:27,856
You know,
we may have went off the rails

1214
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,900
and we may have never got
to see Mr. Winchell pie his dog.

1215
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:33,069
Cheruce's death is
exactly what she said

1216
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:34,571
would make this special amazing.

1217
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:36,614
So... and I'm processing this still,

1218
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,033
but I think that means
it's okay.

1219
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:40,285
Look, here's what I think it means.

1220
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:41,953
As things get crazier,

1221
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:43,913
the chances of dying increase

1222
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,332
along with the quality of the special.

1223
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,500
That's going to be
a tough needle to thread,

1224
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,878
because on one hand,
I'm excited 'cause I get it.

1225
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,338
But on the other,
I really don't want to die.

1226
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:53,715
Okay, Ted Bundy,

1227
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:55,216
tell me wh-wh-what do you think
we should do?

1228
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,510
Well, I would like
to fuck him in the mouth.

1229
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:58,262
Oh!

1230
00:51:58,286 --> 00:51:59,804
- A little bit.
- Holy shit.

1231
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,140
Maybe that's the thing
Turvok's looking for, a little...

1232
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,516
The extra spice.

1233
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,809
Ah, why didn't you say that earlier?

1234
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,769
- We could have...
- I get nervous around you, you know?

1235
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,062
Come on, this is a safe space.

1236
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:11,900
Human salad is back on the menu,

1237
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:13,026
you stupid sluts.

1238
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,235
You filthy sluts.

1239
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:14,987
Mr. Stuffy!

1240
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:16,891
- What the fuck?
- You filthy bitch!

1241
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,847
You filthy sluts!

1242
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:21,743
My husbands, no!

1243
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,467
Everyone's dead.

1244
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,743
I guess we're safe now.

1245
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:42,388
Heh, heh, heh!

1246
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,057
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is going on?

1247
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:45,892
Why is Mr. Stuffy a killer?

1248
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,852
I love you, Mr. Stuffy.

1249
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,062
What, are you guys dumb?

1250
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:50,980
The human salad line
didn't tip you off.

1251
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,690
It's me, Dana Carver.

1252
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,234
I did a Child's Play!

1253
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,610
Now please be quiet

1254
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:58,428
so I can do this creepy walk
towards you.

1255
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:00,699
No!

1256
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:02,158
Holy shit,
he's coming right for us!

1257
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,701
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, yeah, he is, yeah.

1258
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:04,953
But he's, but he's moving kinda slow.

1259
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:06,412
He is moving slow.

1260
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:08,581
I think we have like,
what, like, 60 seconds.

1261
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,166
Maybe 90 seconds, I don't know.

1262
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,668
But whatever it is,
whenever he gets over here,

1263
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,002
we're going to be in big trouble.

1264
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:14,379
I'm starting to think
maybe two minutes,

1265
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:15,964
like a full 120 seconds.

1266
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:18,216
- I think two minutes is a goo...
- Is probably about right.

1267
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,968
Little Long-Legs,
I know I get mad

1268
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,386
when you escape
being tied up at home

1269
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,619
when mommy needs alone time.

1270
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:24,973
But now I want you
to untie yourself.

1271
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:26,933
Use those precious long legs
God gave you.

1272
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:27,810
What the fuck.

1273
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:30,687
Yeah, yeah, um,
Little Long-Legs, untie, untie.

1274
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:34,023
I love my long legs now.

1275
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:36,884
I had an arc. I arced out.

1276
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:40,363
I'm doing it.

1277
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,824
- Quick, Leroy, untie Aunt Stephanie.
- I got an idea.

1278
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,576
You better do something,

1279
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,311
I'm going to get there pretty soon.

1280
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,344
- Mr. Stuffy!
- Way to go, Reggie.

1281
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:04,804
I don't know, Hulu.

1282
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:07,098
I think the Palonis
might have just pulled

1283
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:09,559
a cat out of a bag on this one.

1284
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:11,811
You guys are still hosting
that shitty show.

1285
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:13,771
- Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
- Jesus, Aunt Stephanie, be quiet.

1286
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,357
Yeah, look, and I just want
to say something else.

1287
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:19,068
I really think, I really like
our Halloween special.

1288
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,153
It's pretty good now.

1289
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:22,655
You know, Cheruce, she's dead.
She's dead, she died, and that...

1290
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:23,532
But I think that's alright,

1291
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:26,493
because, because if she
would've seen how it turned out,

1292
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,328
how her death
contributed to the special,

1293
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:29,412
she would love it.

1294
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:30,331
Yeah. Well, I mean,

1295
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:33,291
I wouldn't say that it's okay
that Cheruce is dead,

1296
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:34,210
but yeah, you know.

1297
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,127
I feel good about the special.

1298
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:37,670
Reggie, grab Cheruce's corpse

1299
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:39,797
and let's go home
and finish this show,

1300
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:41,549
having learned that
sometimes it's better

1301
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,009
to let things go off the rails

1302
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,803
than to, you know,
like, try to steer it

1303
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:48,431
with your hands
all fucking tied to the wheel

1304
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,807
and your fucking...

1305
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:51,643
- You know what I mean?
- You said it, Leroy.

1306
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:52,769
Ha. Alright, folks.

1307
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:55,104
Check out our last Halloween short
for the night.

1308
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:02,946
Dude, my fucking
science teacher wants me

1309
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,948
to study fucking science
and shit.

1310
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,366
But it's all bullshit, man.

1311
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,493
It doesn't even make
any fucking sense.

1312
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:11,621
Ah, dude, anyone would be like,
ugh, shit, man.

1313
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,044
Hmm. You know what I noticed
about science?

1314
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:20,237
Is that it's fucking dumb.

1315
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,429
Hey, what are you kids
doing out there?

1316
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:30,723
Take a hike, old man.

1317
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,934
We're pissing on science books.

1318
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:34,310
Yeah, man.

1319
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:38,022
Well, if pissing
on science books is your thing,

1320
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,859
you better not go messing around

1321
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:45,822
down near that
old haunted spaceship

1322
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:48,449
in the woods over there.

1323
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:50,493
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

1324
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:53,580
They say there's
something in there

1325
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:55,957
that don't take too kindly

1326
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:57,709
to little boys and little girls

1327
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,194
who don't do
their science homework.

1328
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:02,279
Well, that's it for me.

1329
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:04,113
Whoa.

1330
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,681
Dude, we were literally
just talking shit

1331
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:12,849
about our science homework.

1332
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:14,017
I mean, let's get out of here.

1333
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,685
This is a little on the nose.

1334
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,395
Will you two shut up, alright?

1335
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:21,882
I'm trying to fucking party
in this fucking haunted spaceship.

1336
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:25,445
Whoa.

1337
00:56:58,752 --> 00:56:59,752
Run!

1338
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,357
- Oh shit!
- Oh, my God.

1339
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,381
Oh, my God.

1340
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:10,889
- Hold on, hold on.
- Come on.

1341
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:13,326
What the heck?
Oh, my God.

1342
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,369
Dude, what the fuck?

1343
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:15,620
Dude, calm down.

1344
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,163
Dude, it's an astronaut, alright?

1345
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:18,998
He's a fucking nerd.
Does math and shit.

1346
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:20,399
We can bully
our way out of this.

1347
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,336
You don't understand, man.

1348
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,171
Like, I know 'cause
I'm all shredded and shit,

1349
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:28,258
everybody thinks I'm like
this fucking super macho tough guy.

1350
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,451
But I have
all these feelings, man.

1351
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,663
No!

1352
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,685
Huh? Wha...

1353
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,103
What the heck?

1354
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:40,938
Oh man.

1355
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:42,129
Oh!

1356
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:44,607
No, don't do it, man.

1357
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:46,883
No!

1358
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,637
Ohh. No, no, no.

1359
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,110
Oh, my God. Oh.

1360
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,745
Oh shit.

1361
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:19,249
Oh no.

1362
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,691
Mm-hmm.

1363
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,845
Well, folks, despite what we thought
was a complete disaster,

1364
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,263
off-the-rails nightmare,

1365
00:58:57,287 --> 00:59:00,099
we pulled off one hell
of a Halloween special.

1366
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:02,977
We even got Mr. Winchell
to keep Cheruce alive

1367
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:05,772
in sort of a Jim Henson
Weekend at Bernie's way.

1368
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:08,233
Hey, all's well that ends well,
right, Reggie?

1369
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:09,984
- Huh, what?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Leroy.

1370
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:12,403
I have just been obsessed
with this strange puzzle cube

1371
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,988
I found at the witch's cabin.

1372
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:16,241
And you know me and puzzle cubes,
you put one in front of me

1373
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,225
and I, I won't put the dam,
the darn thing down.

1374
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,829
- Holy shit, Reggie.
- Why is it glowing all over?

1375
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:22,080
I have no idea, I was twisting.

1376
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,623
- Did you solve it?
- I think I solved it.

1377
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:24,833
Well, what the fuck does it do?

1378
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:25,857
Ow!

1379
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:31,297
Whew! Oh boy.

1380
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,549
Thank you for getting me
out of there.

1381
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:34,843
You have no idea
how many hundreds of people

1382
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:36,636
have been sacrificed
just trying to summon me.

1383
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,681
Jesus, people.
Hello, come on.

1384
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:43,643
It's just a puzzle cube,
like in Hell raiser, you know?

1385
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,062
Anyways...

1386
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:48,273
You have summoned
the great demon Turvok.

1387
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:50,733
As per demon law,
I will grant you one wish!

1388
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,610
No rules, no caveats!

1389
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:53,969
I wish for candy.

1390
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,305
Wish granted.

1391
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:00,243
Are you fucking kidding me?

1392
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,662
Our sister is dead,
and you wished for candy?

1393
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:04,122
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1394
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:05,999
You have diabetes,
you can't have candy.

1395
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:07,083
You fucking bitch!

1396
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:09,460
- Jesus, what is wrong with you?
- Well, folks, that's all she wrote.

1397
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:12,213
And I'm not talking about
that Angela Lansbury show

1398
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:13,214
from the '80s.

1399
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:16,718
Have a Happy Halloween
and hopefully we'll see you next,

1400
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:19,470
at some point, eventually again.

1401
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:20,829
Bye-bye, everybody!
