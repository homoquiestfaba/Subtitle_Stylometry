1
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,930
Negative. No sign.

2
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:46,253
Wait a second. I think I got him.

3
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,172
You know...

4
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:16,844
...you could put someone's eye out
with that thing.

5
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:20,569
We airlifted out the last passengers, Ace.
We're heading out.

6
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,533
What about the animal cargo?

7
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:28,486
Don't worry. It'sjust one little raccoon.
If I were you, I'd turn back.

8
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,163
If you were me, then I'd be you!

9
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,483
And I'd use your body to get to the top!

10
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:37,292
You can't stop me, no matter who you are!

11
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,967
Loser!

12
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,486
L-o-o-...

13
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:49,847
...s-e-r.

14
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,446
Hungry, fella?

15
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,044
That should hold you for a while.

16
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,566
That's okay, Spike.

17
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:03,369
There's nothing more we can do.

18
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:07,212
Look, Spike!

19
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,169
Do not fret, my woodland friend.

20
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,682
Your life is in the hands of Ace ventura...

21
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,366
...Pet Detective.

22
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:53,531
Whatever you do...

23
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,366
...don't look down.

24
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,602
Hang on!

25
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:33,206
Hang on, little buddy!

26
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,807
I got you!

27
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:36,566
I think I got you!

28
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,088
Maybe not.

29
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:39,492
You're slipping!

30
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,771
Don't let go!

31
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,446
My goodness.

32
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:01,922
Hello.

33
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,851
That was quite a shock.

34
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:07,484
It's extremely nice to meet you.

35
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,883
My name is Fulton Greenwall...

36
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,732
...and I am looking for an Ace ventura.

37
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:14,891
No man here...

38
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,725
...carries with him...

39
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:17,928
...a label.

40
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,128
What?

41
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,047
Oh, yes.

42
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:22,965
No names. How silly of me.

43
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,207
He's an American.

44
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,644
We are all children...

45
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,162
...of the same life force.

46
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,891
Yes, of course we are.

47
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:36,573
He bends over and speaks from his rear.

48
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,848
Oh, him.

49
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,283
Right this way.

50
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,761
He came to us a broken man.

51
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,130
He had lost the will
to sustain his existence.

52
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:51,246
Yes, I heard about that
unfortunate accident with the raccoon.

53
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,289
It was terrible for him.

54
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,210
But the life force...

55
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,561
...once again...

56
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:58,211
...smiled upon him.

57
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,442
He's now...

58
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:00,966
...at peace.

59
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,244
I will wait here.

60
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,092
I must apologize.

61
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,529
Quite. Well, no harm done.

62
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,331
Let me introduce myself.

63
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:48,530
My name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I'm here to employ your services...

64
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,604
...in the retrieval of a lost animal.

65
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:51,967
Can you help us?

66
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,169
Your request is like your intestine.

67
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:56,489
Stinky...

68
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,052
...and dangerous.

69
00:08:58,213 --> 00:08:59,931
We can pay handsomely.

70
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,010
I am now a child of light.

71
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:04,972
Your earthly money holds no appeal to me.

72
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,483
$20,000.

73
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:13,051
Really?

74
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,367
No.

75
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:19,922
I cannot.

76
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,723
For I am sorely needed...

77
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,281
...here...

78
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,447
...at the ashram.

79
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,251
May I interject?

80
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,166
We're short of space.

81
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,570
And it's important for you
to use your talents.

82
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,764
Let me help you pack.

83
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:42,482
But I have yet to attain
omnipresent super-galactic oneness.

84
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,048
Wait!

85
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,005
There it is!

86
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,365
You've just attained it.

87
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:50,967
I have?

88
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:52,568
Just now.

89
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,365
You are one!

90
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:57,528
I can see it in your eyes.

91
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,968
You're more one than anyone.

92
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:03,482
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?

93
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:04,608
Take mine.

94
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,523
This took you 80 years to achieve!

95
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:09,483
That's okay.

96
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:11,962
I don't like it anymore. Really.

97
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:18,010
In light of this personal sacrifice
you've made...

98
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,884
...I have no choice...

99
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,087
...but to take the case.

100
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:26,447
Great!

101
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:28,166
I'll tell the others.

102
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,686
Master!

103
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:35,328
Break it to them gently.

104
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,128
I've never seen them act like that before.

105
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,721
Denial can be an ugly thing.

106
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,806
We should go, Mr. ventura.
I've arranged a plane.

107
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,844
I'll meet you at the bottom.

108
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:14,007
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.

109
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:24,769
Isn't this incredible?

110
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,086
It's going to be some kind of record!

111
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,251
"Everyone loves a Slinky

112
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,403
"You got to get a Slinky."

113
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,485
Go, Slinky, go!

114
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,087
Oh, man!

115
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,727
Can you believe it?

116
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,529
It was right there!

117
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,808
Can I do it one more time?

118
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:52,602
Forgive me, but if we don't hurry,
we might miss the plane.

119
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,372
Of course.

120
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:56,450
How selfish of me.

121
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:59,883
Let's do all the things that you want to do.

122
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,288
Canadian moose during mating season.

123
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:27,642
And now...

124
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,532
...a yak.

125
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,442
Peanut?

126
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,965
Yes, I have one right here!

127
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,762
It's bulky, but I consider it a carryon.

128
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,127
Peanuts?

129
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:50,005
Oh, I see!

130
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:54,046
If we can get back to business,
Mr. ventura?

131
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:56,807
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.

132
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,885
Since their sacred animal has vanished...

133
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:03,922
...they believe that there is a curse fallen
on their village.

134
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:08,603
It all started some time ago when,
one night....

135
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:11,924
So, the daughter of the Wachati chief...

136
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,608
...is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe.

137
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:19,164
And the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.

138
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:20,203
But...

139
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,846
...if it is not recovered...

140
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,605
...the result will be...

141
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:26,685
...the merciless slaughter of the Wachati.

142
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:30,521
Mr. ventura?

143
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:36,447
There's...

144
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:37,807
...someone on the wing.

145
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:39,087
Some...

146
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:40,566
...thing!

147
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,050
I'm sorry, what did you say?

148
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,371
The daughter of the Wachati chief...

149
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:50,727
...is set to wed...

150
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,532
...the first son of the Wachootoo tribe.

151
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,771
Spectacular!

152
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,167
This land holds great beauty!

153
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,166
How far to the crime scene?

154
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:38,608
I'm to bring you first to the consulate...

155
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,604
...which is beyond the trees...

156
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,567
...on the other side of the jungle.
So, you'll have to circle around....

157
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,245
Steering's a bit loose!

158
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,286
Alignment's off!

159
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,244
"Oh, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

160
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:09,603
"We love you

161
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:13,572
"And our pretty Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang loves us, too

162
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,123
"On Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we depend

163
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,525
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
our fine four-fendered friend."

164
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:38,932
There's the consulate!

165
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:40,571
Oh, thank God!

166
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,008
If I can just find a parking spot....

167
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,006
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy bit.

168
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,964
Nonsense, poopy pants!

169
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,171
We're going a bit fast!

170
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,204
Really!

171
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:52,567
Look out!

172
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:07,969
Like a glove!

173
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,206
You should get this baby detailed.

174
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,889
The Consul General's car!

175
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:22,681
Down!

176
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:24,292
That's it. Down.

177
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:40,892
Come on, man!

178
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,564
Mr. ventura, so looking forward
to your arrival.

179
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,763
Funny, it didn't seem that painful
when you did it to the horse.

180
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:06,729
Sir...

181
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:10,169
...Mr. ventura has an affinity for animals.

182
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:12,922
Shall we?

183
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,852
Shalln't we?

184
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:19,486
Tell me, Mr. ventura...

185
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,684
...just how good are you?

186
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,447
You're a workaholic.

187
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:27,525
You recently returned from a trip to Gotan,
in Northern Africa...

188
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,491
...and you just took a nasty spill
because of some...

189
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,889
...shoddy masonry work.

190
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,085
very impressive.

191
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,171
May I ask how?

192
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,652
Surely.

193
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:45,608
The abrasion on your hand is the type
sustained in a three-to-five foot fall.

194
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,969
The remnants of plaster on your shoe
pointed to a careless mason.

195
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,248
Your new watch, a quality forgery, was...

196
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,770
...most likely purchased through
the North African black market!

197
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,644
And my work habits?

198
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,566
A workaholic.

199
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,086
The urine stain on your pants...

200
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,448
...would signify that you're a single-shaker!

201
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,683
Far too busy for the follow-up jiggle.

202
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:08,172
Brilliant, Mr. ventura!

203
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,083
Simply brilliant!

204
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,162
Spank you!

205
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,966
Spank you, very much!

206
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:19,050
We've been coexisting quite nicely
with the native cultures...

207
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:23,126
...for the past 200 years.
They're almost like family at this point.

208
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:23,844
Are they?

209
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:26,891
It is imperative that we recover
the sacred animal.

210
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:30,522
If not, the peaceable Wachati
will be obliterated.

211
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:33,003
The Wachootoo are bloodthirsty.

212
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:37,001
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.

213
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:45,849
Do I have something in my teeth?

214
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,208
Cadby!

215
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:50,449
Lovely brunch, I must say.

216
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:52,369
Quinn!

217
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:55,092
I'd like you to meet Ace ventura.

218
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:59,612
This is Burton Quinn. He owns
and operates Quinnland Safari Park.

219
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,332
Most call me Quinn.

220
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,092
Say hello, Tinky.

221
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:05,608
Pleasure, Tinky.

222
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,730
Corvus corax. Common raven.
Smartest of all birds.

223
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,963
Rare in these parts.

224
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,841
Excuse me.

225
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,690
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.

226
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,162
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers...

227
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,529
...made from the heads of innocent
and defenseless baby seals!

228
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:33,651
Who is this ghastly man?

229
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:36,043
Ace ventura, Pet Detective.

230
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:37,602
You must be...

231
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,126
...the Monopoly Guy!

232
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,363
Thanks for the free parking.

233
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,608
Another activist, Maguire.

234
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:49,963
Activist, yes.

235
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,005
Activist, yes.

236
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:57,326
Mr. ventura...

237
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:01,845
...there's nothing wrong
with enjoying the fruits of nature.

238
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,205
You should try it some time.

239
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,005
All righty, then.

240
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,526
You know something?

241
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,046
You're right.

242
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,970
"Do not pass go.
Do not collect two hundred dollars."

243
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:53,372
It's lovely, but I fancy myself an autumn.

244
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,842
If you've quite finished, Mr. ventura...

245
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,812
...we might make for the projection room.

246
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:05,252
Kooky.

247
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:11,209
I'd like you to meet Hitu,
chief of tribal security in the province.

248
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:12,521
Please!

249
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,602
Don't...

250
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:16,362
...get up.

251
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,849
At this point, we don't have any leads...

252
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,572
...but we've had similar problems
in the past.

253
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:35,442
Sorry.

254
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,052
This is Derrick McCane...

255
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,809
...spotted several times in the province
in the past year. He makes a living...

256
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,567
...from rare and endangered species.

257
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,571
These two are Australians.

258
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:55,609
The bald one is Mick Katie.

259
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,931
The other is said to have been raised
by aborigine--

260
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,205
Aborigines.

261
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,886
The natives call him--

262
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:09,048
Call him Gahjii...

263
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,486
...the hunter.

264
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:16,089
Both are known poachers
and have been seen in the area!

265
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:21,608
This wedding's in four days.
I cannot have bloodshed here!

266
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:23,724
We're counting on you!

267
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:34,887
Hi-ho, Silver!

268
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,406
Away!

269
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:39,886
I've assigned Greenwall to assist you.

270
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,453
Before you go, Mr. ventura...

271
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,969
...I'd like to show you something
you may enjoy.

272
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,693
As one animal lover to another.

273
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,683
Something wrong, Mr. ventura?

274
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,561
Of course not.

275
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:17,525
It's a lovely room of death.

276
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,769
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

277
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,646
Down, Boba!

278
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,851
Mr. ventura, how could you?

279
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:58,328
Now, Mr. ventura, I think the village
is about a mile ahead.

280
00:23:58,493 --> 00:23:59,608
Excellent.

281
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,008
Flat tire!

282
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:06,331
I think this joke has run its course,
don't you?

283
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:07,882
Certainly.

284
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:10,646
I prostrate myself before you
and beg forgiveness.

285
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:13,122
Don't get me wrong.
I do enjoy the occasional prank.

286
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:15,932
It's just that my heel is getting rather raw.

287
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:22,165
We love you, Dark Continent! Good night!

288
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,128
Listen!

289
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:32,205
The majestic song
of the male silverback gorilla.

290
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:37,328
We should move along. It's their mating
season and they can get rather hostile.

291
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:52,964
Excuse me, Mr. ventura.

292
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:54,526
I have to rest.

293
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:56,371
Of course you do!

294
00:24:57,013 --> 00:25:00,403
The Wachati believe they draw their power
from these caves.

295
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:04,532
Now they live in fear
since their sacred bat has vanished.

296
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:06,762
Bat?

297
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:10,802
What...

298
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:11,928
...bat?

299
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,323
The one we're here to find, Mr. ventura.

300
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,689
You didn't say anything about a bat.

301
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:18,769
What's the difference?

302
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,571
What's the difference?

303
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,088
Have you seen one? They're hideous.

304
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:27,929
Lifeless, beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge grotesque wings. Even fangs.

305
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,371
They give you rabies.

306
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,645
Yes, quite. I see your point.

307
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,725
But are you saying
that you won't take the case?

308
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:41,848
No.

309
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:45,570
As a being of light, I must show
compassion for all living things.

310
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:46,608
Good.

311
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,685
I'm not touching it, though!

312
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:50,492
No, spank you.

313
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:06,323
The Wachati are a peaceful people.

314
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:08,882
They find all forms of life sacred.

315
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:10,811
I like them already.

316
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,732
Bumbawae Atuna.

317
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:15,687
Nice to see you.

318
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:17,047
Bumblebee Tuna.

319
00:26:17,213 --> 00:26:18,646
Bumblebee Tuna.

320
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:21,291
Ace ventura, Pet Detective.

321
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,607
How are you?

322
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,690
All righty, then.

323
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:29,012
Excuse me.

324
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:30,930
Your balls are showing.

325
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:32,692
Bumblebee Tuna.

326
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:37,049
They have lived in the same state
for thousands of years.

327
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:40,683
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.

328
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,205
What's going on over here?

329
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,930
All young Wachati warriors
must face five days...

330
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,492
...of balance and concentration.

331
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,962
Should he lose his focus and fall...

332
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:57,203
...he must start over again.

333
00:26:58,453 --> 00:26:59,886
Earthquake test!

334
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:05,007
He's good.

335
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,092
With my help, he could be the best.

336
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,489
We should see the chief, Mr. ventura.

337
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:12,083
This way.

338
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,526
Neato!

339
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,167
The chief says he knew you would come.

340
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,971
"Chim-chiminy chim-chim-cheroo!"

341
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:45,004
The chief has not understood
the dialect you're using.

342
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,327
Say I'm happy to meet him.

343
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,244
And that his sacred...

344
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:50,642
...bat...

345
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:52,405
...is as good as found.

346
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:05,370
My goodness. The chief really seems
to like you.

347
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:08,729
That is a great sign of affection
in the Wachati tribe.

348
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:14,007
Really?

349
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,884
This is the chief's son, Ouda.

350
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:19,846
The missionaries came through
and taught him English.

351
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,366
I like you!

352
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:27,602
My....

353
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,964
Aren't I the popular one?

354
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:37,051
Allow me to display my affection.

355
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,766
It is the mucus...

356
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,685
...that binds us.

357
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:14,602
The chief says that
the sacred hut is over there.

358
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,292
How'd they pass the guard?

359
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:26,012
I'm afraid he was found shortly after...

360
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,732
...sleeping.

361
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,805
At ease, Soldier.

362
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:33,004
We all make mistakes.

363
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:47,726
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy, flying weasel.

364
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:51,322
Please, Mr. ventura!

365
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:55,452
That is sacred ground. I'm sorry,
but only the Wachati are allowed there.

366
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:58,122
Take it easy.

367
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,249
I'm the lougie guy, remember?

368
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,968
Yes, yes, Chief. Thank you.

369
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:16,681
Thank you.

370
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:20,006
The chief says that unless
the sacred bat is returned...

371
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:24,723
...before the marriage of the princess,
the Wachati tribe will meet their death.

372
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,368
What type of bat are we talking about?

373
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,961
The great white bat, of course.

374
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:40,723
Crepuscular Chiroptera?

375
00:30:40,893 --> 00:30:42,804
But to the natives:

376
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,088
Shikaka.

377
00:30:57,893 --> 00:30:59,372
Shikasha!

378
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:02,652
Shish kebab.

379
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,682
Shawshank Redemption.

380
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:06,126
Chicago!

381
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:08,245
You're out of there!

382
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,643
Go on. You're gone. Go on!

383
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,965
Were you going to eat these?

384
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:49,853
I've got to inspect that cage.

385
00:31:56,573 --> 00:31:58,165
My, my, my.

386
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:00,848
This fruit paste is delicious!

387
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,692
The pottery is lovely!

388
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:04,172
It's made from guano.

389
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:05,606
Guano?

390
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:07,365
That sounds so familiar.

391
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,171
Bat droppings.

392
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:17,170
It's a chief resource of the Wachati.
They use it to make things.

393
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,044
Yummy!

394
00:32:41,853 --> 00:32:46,563
Now this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition.

395
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:49,042
The virgin's dance of seduction.

396
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,891
I am now a holy man.

397
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:58,726
I think of women only as mothers
of our children.

398
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,452
They are a sanctuary
for the reproductive organs.

399
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:04,684
A temple to house the miracle
of procreation.

400
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,252
Do you have $1?

401
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:13,929
Thank you so much!

402
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:16,208
I've not danced in years!

403
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,212
Hi.

404
00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:39,090
Don't mind me.

405
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:40,852
Sleep.

406
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:42,965
Sleep!

407
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:52,411
Fe...Fi!

408
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:55,249
Fo...fum!

409
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:59,249
I smell the fingerprints of scum!

410
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,451
Better dust the place.

411
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,171
Totally clean.

412
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:25,853
Not one damn clue.

413
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:30,132
Unless....

414
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:11,604
Here she comes. Oh, boy.

415
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:13,843
Holy, holy, holy, holy.

416
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,612
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.

417
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:18,649
You have come to help us.

418
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:20,407
We are in...

419
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:22,644
...great appreciation.

420
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:24,041
You...

421
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:26,568
...speak English.

422
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:27,927
Yes!

423
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:30,608
The missionaries came with books.

424
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:40,048
You are very good with that!

425
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:42,124
It's incredibly accurate.

426
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,372
Care to try?

427
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:51,246
Not bad!

428
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,729
Try again. Relax your shoulders.

429
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:55,122
Breathe.

430
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:56,885
And release.

431
00:35:59,653 --> 00:36:01,371
There you go!

432
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:04,050
You make me smile.

433
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:07,251
And yet...

434
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,005
...I am troubled.

435
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,726
You see...

436
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:15,891
...the man my father wants me to marry...

437
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:19,252
...I am worried I will not please him.

438
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,128
I've never known a man.

439
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:37,967
I'd love to help.

440
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,406
But you see...

441
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:43,123
...I have vowed to take a life of celibacy.

442
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:45,961
Well....

443
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:47,361
Perhaps this...

444
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:49,968
...will assist your decision.

445
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,405
Those are very nice.

446
00:36:56,573 --> 00:36:58,962
But I am a child of light. A pure spirit.

447
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:02,171
I'm no longer encumbered
by sexual appetites.

448
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,362
Oh, mama, oh, mama...

449
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:11,122
...oh, mama, oh, mama....

450
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,850
I'm so sorry, Mr. ventura....

451
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,365
That's okay.

452
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:27,611
I was just...

453
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:30,963
...practicing my mantra.

454
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:37,004
Didn't you want to visit the sacred caves?

455
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:38,162
I do!

456
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,444
Meet me outside in ten minutes.

457
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,849
If I don't finish my meditation...

458
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,493
...I tend to get a little cranky.

459
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,884
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

460
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:59,291
Everything here seems good!
Big load off my mind!

461
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:03,281
You can speculate all you want,
but unless you check it out yourself...

462
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:04,607
...you never know.

463
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:05,443
Let's go back.

464
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,444
Don't you think you should investigate?

465
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:10,127
There's no reason to go in there. Ever.

466
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:12,011
I sense it as a holy man.

467
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:14,328
-You said you wanted--
-It's dark!

468
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:17,047
I could fall into a precipice.

469
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:18,602
Take this.

470
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:23,086
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.

471
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,325
I am not afraid!

472
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:50,288
I am not afraid.

473
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,331
I really like it here.

474
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,086
My medallion!

475
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,406
I will fear no living creature...

476
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:26,447
...as long as I keep this near me.

477
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,762
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!

478
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:38,286
That's okay.

479
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:43,088
All I really need is my torch.

480
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:45,649
Die, devil bird!

481
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:51,081
I'm okay.

482
00:39:58,533 --> 00:39:59,886
They're in my hair!

483
00:40:00,013 --> 00:40:01,969
They're in my hair!

484
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:05,850
God in heaven! Help me!

485
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,803
There is nothing in your hair.

486
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:12,568
Exactly.

487
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,563
I was merely running a drill.

488
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:22,929
Just as I suspected.

489
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,003
Quinn.

490
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:25,162
What?

491
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:27,450
We met him at Cadby's soirée.

492
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,366
His bird is a raven, Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.

493
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:33,968
You don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a powerful man.

494
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,566
Worry not.

495
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,451
For I...

496
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:40,526
...am a master...

497
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,445
...of disguises.

498
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:35,772
Eat up, guys!

499
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:38,288
None of this animal goes to waste.

500
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,768
Mr. McCane.

501
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:13,162
How're you?

502
00:42:13,253 --> 00:42:14,925
I'm doing well.

503
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:24,843
Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.

504
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:28,247
I'm just a curious little rhino.

505
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:30,329
I appreciate your...

506
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:32,724
...agreeing to undertake this.

507
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:44,208
Meeting secretly with sinister types much?

508
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:47,725
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.

509
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,923
Kind of hot in these rhinos.

510
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:24,086
Warm!

511
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:34,285
I had a dog and his name was...

512
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,052
...Bingo!

513
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:40,685
Time to get some oxygen.

514
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:48,885
Come on!

515
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:00,530
Mayday!

516
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:08,449
Must...

517
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:09,807
...have...

518
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:11,446
...air!

519
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:34,448
Come on!

520
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,928
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Look, look.

521
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:44,245
Oh, look!

522
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:47,287
The mother rhino is giving birth!

523
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:52,685
Oh, God.

524
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,321
Mommy!

525
00:45:23,453 --> 00:45:24,852
Cool!

526
00:45:25,053 --> 00:45:26,372
We have to get out of here!

527
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:28,045
Quick, get in the jeep.

528
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:29,851
Quick, girls, get in!

529
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:32,724
Welcome to Quinnland.

530
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:37,282
And you, too, my friend.

531
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:43,289
I know, you'll be happy here.

532
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:53,363
How did you get out, fella?

533
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:57,682
You're a cute little devil.

534
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:00,405
What you got?

535
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,530
Where's the bat?

536
00:46:20,133 --> 00:46:21,930
What's this about?

537
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,448
Who are you?

538
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:25,168
Where...

539
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:26,801
...is...

540
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:28,691
...the bat?

541
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:30,565
I know who you are.

542
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:33,009
I met you at Cadby's!

543
00:46:33,213 --> 00:46:34,407
You're that...

544
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:35,846
...ventura fella!

545
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:37,850
Last chance!

546
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,930
Where is that darn bat?

547
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:44,650
What're you going to do?

548
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,532
What're you going to do?

549
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:49,366
Whatever I have to get some answers.

550
00:46:57,373 --> 00:46:58,488
Stop!

551
00:46:58,573 --> 00:46:59,767
Stop it!

552
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:02,483
You'd like me to stop it.

553
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:04,251
Getting to you?

554
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:07,050
I won't tell you anything.

555
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,244
A tough guy, huh?

556
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:20,887
I know what to do with tough guys.

557
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:33,764
My brother used to do that!

558
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:35,525
You sadistic bastard!

559
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:36,932
Stop it!

560
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:38,651
All right! I'll talk!

561
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:39,483
Spill it!

562
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:43,043
I paid Derrick McCane to find the bat.

563
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:48,727
I thought it could be an attraction.

564
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:51,283
Business has been a bit off lately.

565
00:47:51,373 --> 00:47:52,726
So...

566
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:56,088
...you don't know who...

567
00:47:58,253 --> 00:47:58,890
...took the bat?

568
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,645
Neither does McCane.

569
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,369
I'm going to untie you now.

570
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:12,881
Before I do, I want you
to know that I'm really...

571
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,167
...truly...

572
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:15,203
...very...

573
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,204
...sorry!

574
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:23,605
Appreciate the lift!

575
00:48:23,973 --> 00:48:25,770
We'll walk from here.

576
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:33,605
Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues.

577
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:35,126
But I have instincts.

578
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:38,091
And my instincts tell me
we're getting closer.

579
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,607
I can feel it.

580
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:42,572
I can feel it like it's right...

581
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:44,327
...in my neck!

582
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:45,932
Run!

583
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,085
Starting to get numb!

584
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:03,205
Three darts...

585
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:04,726
...is too much!

586
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:36,048
I think...

587
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:38,408
...I lost them!

588
00:50:07,573 --> 00:50:08,688
Flowers...

589
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:10,611
...for me?

590
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:14,211
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.

591
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,128
You are my hero.

592
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:25,886
Was I...

593
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:27,972
...talking in my sleep?

594
00:50:28,053 --> 00:50:32,092
You've been suffering hysteria.
It's a natural reaction to the poison.

595
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:33,487
Water.

596
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,524
Guano bowls.

597
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:44,932
Collect the whole set.

598
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:47,447
Ace, did you see the shooter?

599
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:48,887
Only their feet.

600
00:50:49,173 --> 00:50:50,970
Not enough for a positive ID.

601
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:53,363
It's the dart of a Wachootoo shaman.

602
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,402
The whaty whatan?

603
00:50:55,493 --> 00:50:59,566
The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,
has protested the intertribal wedding.

604
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:04,852
Has he?

605
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,730
You do not speak Wachootoo.

606
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:10,690
I go with you.

607
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:13,563
Ouda will be my interpreter.

608
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,082
Please, take care.

609
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:21,325
The Wachootoo are savages.
If they catch you, they'll be merciless.

610
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,566
Worry not.

611
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:27,484
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.

612
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:31,249
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...

613
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,607
...thing.

614
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,609
The sacred bat must be in a hut.

615
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:04,566
We'll never know until
I can walk freely among them.

616
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,005
Wunderbar!

617
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,442
He exclaimed with great relish.

618
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,567
Come on, girls, show them what you got.

619
00:52:54,973 --> 00:52:56,167
I'm sure it's fine.

620
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:58,642
Ouda is probably going for help right now.

621
00:52:58,973 --> 00:53:00,452
Hello, Ace!

622
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:02,002
They found me!

623
00:53:02,093 --> 00:53:03,651
No sweat!

624
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:08,043
Don't beat yourself up.

625
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,566
You know...

626
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:21,646
...gingivitis is the No.1 cause
of all tooth decay.

627
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,846
What does equinsu ocha mean?

628
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:29,412
White devil.

629
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:30,968
Tell him I'm not.

630
00:53:31,053 --> 00:53:33,726
I only met you. How do I know?

631
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:40,890
-He said--
-Let me guess. "White devil"?

632
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:42,486
You speak Wachootoo?

633
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:44,604
Tell them what I'm saying:

634
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,327
I come in peace!

635
00:53:55,453 --> 00:53:58,013
I couldn't help but notice
the equinsu ocha part.

636
00:53:58,093 --> 00:53:59,970
Did you refer to me as "White Devil"?

637
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:01,452
That's how they know you.

638
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:03,728
Leave that part out from now on.

639
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:06,768
I represent the princess!

640
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:17,448
"War...

641
00:54:17,773 --> 00:54:19,252
"...is hell."

642
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:21,803
The last thing we want...

643
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:24,646
...is a fight.

644
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:40,048
The chief said...

645
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,328
...if you pass all Wachootoo tests...

646
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:44,211
...you do not die.

647
00:54:47,573 --> 00:54:49,052
Kooky.

648
00:56:08,253 --> 00:56:11,131
My entrance to the winner's circle!

649
00:56:11,613 --> 00:56:15,162
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.

650
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,608
Do not worship me!

651
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,245
Chief says you have passed all tests
but one.

652
00:56:30,613 --> 00:56:33,525
Only left is Wachootoo Circle of Death.

653
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:35,172
Funny...

654
00:56:35,413 --> 00:56:37,449
...that's my specialty.

655
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,406
This is it?

656
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:15,683
I have to beat him?

657
00:57:28,093 --> 00:57:29,924
All righty, then!

658
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,845
I must tell you...

659
00:57:36,013 --> 00:57:37,685
...I don't wish to fight.

660
00:57:38,493 --> 00:57:41,451
violence is no longer in my nature...

661
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:44,645
...but if you want it, you got it, sister.

662
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:51,845
Biting, I see.

663
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:54,732
I was unaware that the Wachootoo...

664
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:57,604
...were biters!

665
00:57:58,733 --> 00:58:01,531
Why don't you try this on
and see how it fits?

666
00:58:07,853 --> 00:58:09,923
He much better fighter than you.

667
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:11,612
Doi!

668
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:29,126
All right!

669
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:32,012
This White Devil thing
has gone far enough.

670
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,482
Nobody...

671
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:35,212
...messes...

672
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,369
...with the "do"!

673
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:56,728
He said, sorry, White Devil...

674
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,571
...but he must kill you.

675
00:59:00,213 --> 00:59:02,522
I'll have you know
I have the reflexes of a cat.

676
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:04,968
And the speed of a mongoose.

677
00:59:05,373 --> 00:59:06,567
Throw it!

678
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,405
I dare you!

679
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:27,763
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!

680
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:57,292
It's in the bone! It's in the bone!

681
00:59:57,413 --> 00:59:59,847
It's in the bone!

682
01:00:16,973 --> 01:00:18,691
He says you make him laugh.

683
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:21,282
You are like sissy girl!

684
01:00:36,653 --> 01:00:40,089
Wachootoo Chief say,
"You friend to Wachootoo."

685
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:51,211
But if the curse of Shikaka not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky...

686
01:00:51,373 --> 01:00:55,446
...Wachootoo kill all Wachati
and smash your head on a rock.

687
01:00:58,013 --> 01:00:59,162
Super.

688
01:00:59,373 --> 01:01:01,284
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

689
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:03,847
Take care, now. Super. Bye-bye, then.

690
01:01:05,773 --> 01:01:06,842
Are your legs sore?

691
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:08,730
Want me to carry you?

692
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:10,730
That won't be necessary.

693
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:12,485
I have a high pain threshold.

694
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:14,325
Holy monkey!

695
01:01:38,373 --> 01:01:40,329
Ace, why you stopped?

696
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:44,561
The Wachootoo didn't take Shikaka.

697
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:49,211
Hi, welcome back.

698
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:51,406
What would you say this is?

699
01:01:51,493 --> 01:01:53,131
Dart of Wachootoo shaman.

700
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:54,648
Precisely.

701
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:57,691
And when compared to one of the darts
that hit me before?

702
01:01:57,773 --> 01:01:58,603
Same.

703
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:01,362
Only to the untrained eye.

704
01:02:02,173 --> 01:02:05,165
The Wachootoo dart is made of wood
from a mimosa tree...

705
01:02:05,293 --> 01:02:09,605
...while the other is carved
from a red fungus-bearing acalla.

706
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:12,492
And there's only one area
of the jungle with red...

707
01:02:12,653 --> 01:02:14,405
...fungus-bearing acallas.

708
01:02:15,693 --> 01:02:16,921
Go back to the village.

709
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:19,846
Tell them the Wachootoos attack
tomorrow at noon.

710
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:26,489
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.

711
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:39,123
Won't be long now, Katie.

712
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:43,644
Big night tonight.

713
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:45,849
You're going to meet your new owner.

714
01:02:46,653 --> 01:02:47,529
G'day.

715
01:02:47,613 --> 01:02:49,285
Disgusting rat!

716
01:03:05,053 --> 01:03:06,725
Gravy!

717
01:03:11,773 --> 01:03:13,445
Did you hear that?

718
01:03:14,413 --> 01:03:15,482
What is it?

719
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:17,006
Silverback.

720
01:03:27,893 --> 01:03:29,326
Female.

721
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:31,248
Big.

722
01:03:32,053 --> 01:03:34,248
About 200 meters...

723
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:37,012
...south.

724
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,047
We'd get $5,000 for one of those.

725
01:03:40,293 --> 01:03:42,727
-What about the rat?
-Don't worry about it.

726
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:44,685
We'll be back in no time.

727
01:03:49,653 --> 01:03:51,405
Stay downwind of it.

728
01:04:06,293 --> 01:04:08,488
You're even uglier than I thought.

729
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:11,363
She's a big one, isn't she?

730
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:31,092
Oh, boy.

731
01:04:31,293 --> 01:04:33,124
Deciduous trees on the bank.

732
01:04:33,773 --> 01:04:35,809
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.

733
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:37,849
Steadily increasing water current.

734
01:04:37,933 --> 01:04:39,048
Spike...

735
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:43,206
...I think we could assume
the stream gets pretty rough up ahead.

736
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:55,690
As soon as I get you loose,
you can chew through my ropes.

737
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,002
That's it!

738
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:04,168
That's it!

739
01:05:05,453 --> 01:05:07,045
Yes. Your turn.

740
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:11,242
All right!

741
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:54,771
I'm alive!

742
01:05:57,493 --> 01:05:59,563
I'm alive!

743
01:06:14,613 --> 01:06:16,524
Say "uncle"! Say "uncle"!

744
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,642
Don't start what you can't finish!

745
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:28,412
Quit hitting yourself!

746
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:30,165
Quit hitting yourself!

747
01:06:30,693 --> 01:06:33,651
Oh, water tastes good, yes!

748
01:06:40,813 --> 01:06:42,565
This isn't over yet.

749
01:06:42,653 --> 01:06:46,532
There's something I missed.
Some clue or motive I've overlooked.

750
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:49,168
And that motive is...

751
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:51,527
...plah!

752
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:52,967
Think!

753
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,169
Someone wants the tribes
to destroy each other.

754
01:06:55,253 --> 01:06:57,972
There must be something valuable
in this equation.

755
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,403
Perhaps we should meditate, Spike.

756
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:03,570
For it is said that when seeking answers,
one must...

757
01:07:03,893 --> 01:07:06,282
...quiet the soul in order to hear them.

758
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,329
What is it the Wachati possess...

759
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:16,805
...that is of great value to other men...

760
01:07:17,013 --> 01:07:19,732
...besides the princess
with the amazing rack?

761
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:33,362
All righty, then.

762
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:17,772
You're back?

763
01:08:19,093 --> 01:08:21,891
You can dispense with the smallpox,
all-knowing one.

764
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:25,124
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.

765
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:27,772
very well.

766
01:08:27,933 --> 01:08:29,605
What answer do you seek?

767
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:32,043
What do the Wachati possess...

768
01:08:32,173 --> 01:08:34,733
...that is of great value to civilized man?

769
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:38,569
The medallion will lead you to the answer.

770
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:43,125
You do still have the medallion, don't you?

771
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:44,243
Medallion?

772
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,289
Why, surely.

773
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:49,163
I left it back...

774
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:51,252
...with my body.

775
01:08:51,413 --> 01:08:52,971
Your aura...

776
01:08:53,293 --> 01:08:55,363
...is weakening.

777
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:57,967
Okay! I threw it in a cave!

778
01:08:58,133 --> 01:09:01,523
What do you want from me?
What are you? Mr. Perfect?

779
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:03,047
Where is it?

780
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:05,090
It's probably lying...

781
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:07,727
...in a big pile of....

782
01:09:23,613 --> 01:09:24,966
Guano!

783
01:09:26,173 --> 01:09:28,926
They have guano!

784
01:09:39,493 --> 01:09:40,972
Like...

785
01:09:41,413 --> 01:09:43,085
...a glove.

786
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:47,892
Hi, Chief!

787
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:50,569
Appreciate your meeting me here.

788
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:53,764
Let's go kick some...

789
01:09:55,093 --> 01:09:57,004
...consulate butt.

790
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:07,972
Hello, Ace.

791
01:10:08,893 --> 01:10:09,643
You want your money?

792
01:10:09,733 --> 01:10:12,327
Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.

793
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:15,206
I've come for the sacred bat. Where is it?

794
01:10:15,533 --> 01:10:16,409
Why...

795
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:18,451
...whatever can you mean?

796
01:10:18,573 --> 01:10:19,847
Guano!

797
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:21,128
Hello!

798
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,210
Does "poop" ring a bell?

799
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:26,848
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate...

800
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:29,493
"...producing 84 percent
of the world's fertilizer...

801
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:32,041
"...a $1.4 billion industry."

802
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:34,169
That's what this war is about.

803
01:10:34,653 --> 01:10:39,204
You can't take possession of the caves
while the Wachati inhabit the area.

804
01:10:39,373 --> 01:10:41,523
And you want that dookie so bad...

805
01:10:41,693 --> 01:10:43,126
...you can taste it.

806
01:10:43,213 --> 01:10:44,407
I thought that--

807
01:10:44,493 --> 01:10:46,643
Yes, thank you, Fulton.

808
01:10:48,973 --> 01:10:51,692
That's a fine theory, Mr. ventura.

809
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,085
What's it got to do with me?

810
01:10:54,893 --> 01:10:56,804
I thought you'd...

811
01:10:56,973 --> 01:10:58,486
...never ask.

812
01:11:02,093 --> 01:11:04,607
When I met you, there was
a white substance on your shoe.

813
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:07,526
Yesterday, I saw the same substance
outside the hut...

814
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:10,650
...and it hit me that
the Great White Bat has white guano.

815
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,803
That's what you slipped in!
It was on your shoe!

816
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:15,691
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

817
01:11:15,933 --> 01:11:17,764
Let me run that back for you.

818
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:25,443
That's what you slipped in!
It was on your shoe!

819
01:11:25,533 --> 01:11:28,969
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

820
01:11:30,093 --> 01:11:31,845
Damn, I'm good!

821
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:33,446
Can you feel that?

822
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:34,922
Can you feel it...

823
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:36,571
...Captain Compost?

824
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:41,085
The day of redemption is at hand!

825
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:43,851
Repent!

826
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:47,610
And thou shall be saved.

827
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:50,647
very good.

828
01:11:53,133 --> 01:11:54,407
very good.

829
01:11:54,973 --> 01:11:57,009
I believe you've solved the case.

830
01:11:57,133 --> 01:12:00,967
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.

831
01:12:01,493 --> 01:12:04,610
If you are the slime behind
this little flim-flam...

832
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:06,246
...why, oh, why...

833
01:12:07,413 --> 01:12:09,210
...did you hire me?

834
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:12,405
I'm afraid there'll be an investigation
after the war.

835
01:12:12,573 --> 01:12:13,847
You were my alibi...

836
01:12:13,933 --> 01:12:16,811
...to prove I'd done everything I could
to stop it.

837
01:12:17,053 --> 01:12:18,122
Arrest him.

838
01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:20,087
Arrest him!

839
01:12:22,653 --> 01:12:24,006
Please arrest him.

840
01:12:25,773 --> 01:12:27,445
Simon says, "Arrest him."

841
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:39,610
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. ventura.

842
01:12:40,053 --> 01:12:42,886
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. ventura.

843
01:12:45,453 --> 01:12:47,683
Shall I stick him on the wall?

844
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:51,249
No, I don't think it'll be necessary, Gahjii.

845
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:55,566
Mr. ventura has very cleverly stolen
the sacred bat of the Wachati.

846
01:12:55,733 --> 01:12:59,931
Unfortunately, we were unable
to recover it in time to stop the war.

847
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:02,681
Hit the lights!

848
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:07,252
The switch is on the wall beside you!
Go for it!

849
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,006
Flick it!

850
01:13:21,853 --> 01:13:23,047
All righty, then.

851
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:25,124
Shall we go to jail?

852
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:37,286
What are you? H.R. Shove-n-Stuff?

853
01:13:39,093 --> 01:13:40,082
Get in!

854
01:13:41,693 --> 01:13:43,285
Just one more thing.

855
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:52,086
What are you doing?

856
01:13:57,773 --> 01:13:58,728
Stop it!

857
01:13:59,053 --> 01:14:00,566
I said, stop it!

858
01:14:09,133 --> 01:14:10,885
To the jungle, Boba!

859
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:27,082
Friends...

860
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:28,522
...rodents...

861
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:30,052
...quadrupeds!

862
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,489
Lend me your ears!

863
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,809
Imbecile! You let him get away!

864
01:14:42,933 --> 01:14:45,811
You don't seem to understand.
The tribe will be killed.

865
01:14:45,893 --> 01:14:47,929
Remind me to send a sympathy card.

866
01:14:48,013 --> 01:14:49,605
We're going to get the bastard.

867
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,684
There's nothing he can do now.

868
01:14:51,773 --> 01:14:54,492
We've got the bat, and it's nearly noon.

869
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:12,971
What the hell's going on?

870
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:54,250
You see...

871
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:58,282
...humans and animals can live in harmony!

872
01:16:11,453 --> 01:16:13,523
Sorry for the delay, Ace.

873
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:19,211
Hey, Poachers!

874
01:16:19,773 --> 01:16:20,762
Say hello...

875
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:23,731
...to my stinky little friend!

876
01:16:41,213 --> 01:16:42,805
Get out! Get out!

877
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:46,004
Not so fast, Sally!

878
01:16:49,253 --> 01:16:50,971
Get it away!

879
01:17:47,253 --> 01:17:49,813
He wants to go off-road.

880
01:17:55,893 --> 01:17:58,453
Nobody wants to play with me.

881
01:18:05,173 --> 01:18:06,447
Loser!

882
01:18:21,853 --> 01:18:23,889
From the consulate, right?

883
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,171
This is weird.

884
01:19:29,813 --> 01:19:30,962
Noon.

885
01:19:33,493 --> 01:19:34,926
The Wachati.

886
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,084
The spirit will overcome.

887
01:19:41,213 --> 01:19:42,931
The spirit will overcome.

888
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:19,123
Headhunters!

889
01:20:40,893 --> 01:20:42,611
Shikaka!

890
01:20:53,693 --> 01:20:55,923
Coming through. Clear a path, people!

891
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:29,043
They will now consummate the marriage
as the tribe watches.

892
01:22:29,173 --> 01:22:30,242
Well done, Ace.

893
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,893
You must be extremely proud.

894
01:22:33,293 --> 01:22:34,931
Pride is an abomination.

895
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:36,805
One must forego the self...

896
01:22:36,893 --> 01:22:39,407
...to attain spiritual creaminess...

897
01:22:39,893 --> 01:22:42,282
...and avoid the chewy chunks...

898
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:44,405
...of degradation.

899
01:22:52,373 --> 01:22:53,408
What'd he say?

900
01:22:53,493 --> 01:22:56,565
I think he's saying, "She's not a virgin."

901
01:22:58,013 --> 01:22:59,571
They can tell that?
