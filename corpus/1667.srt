1
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,250
...get out of here alive, I tell you.

2
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,193
Let's go!

3
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,037
Incoming!

4
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,125
- Sorry, captain.
- It's all right, son, just keep moving.

5
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,252
That's the future in your hands.

6
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,340
Heave! Heave! Heave!

7
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,677
- Starboard gunners ready, captain.
- Lieutenant.

8
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,474
Fire!

9
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,438
Prepare to take us into the channel.
Ahead a half.

10
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,691
- Make revolutions for five knots.
- Aye, sir.

11
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:56,325
- Range, 150 yards!
- 150 yards!

12
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,330
Fire!

13
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,459
Fire!

14
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,256
Fire!

15
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,139
- All ahead full.
- Aye, captain.

16
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,715
Stop engines.

17
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,967
- Captain?
- Stop engines! Run silent!

18
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,886
Cease firing!

19
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,723
Cease firing!
Close the gun ports. Hold still.

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,100
- Cease firing!
- Close the gun ports!

21
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,130
Mrs. Nwokolo?

22
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,217
Eva Rojas, World Health Organization.
This is Dr. Hopper.

23
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,427
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Please come with me.

24
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,227
Sorry about the dark.
The light hurts his eyes.

25
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,978
- Thank you.
- What's his name?

26
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,439
Azikiwe. Most call him Kiwe.

27
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,817
Hi, Kiwe. My name is Eva.

28
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,486
We need to have a little look
at you, okay?

29
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,613
- How long has he been sick?
- For two days.

30
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,950
- Has he traveled anywhere recently?
- He was in Mali last week.

31
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:12,660
With his father.

32
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:16,038
- Where is his father now?
- He's at the lighthouse.

33
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,456
That's where he works.

34
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,125
Blood pressure, 80/50.

35
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,502
- Circulatory failure.
- Drawing blood.

36
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,883
- Easy, son. Easy. No, no.
- Kiwe!

37
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,802
- Sedative, Eva.
- What dose?

38
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,095
Two mils.

39
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,764
Easy, son. Easy. No. It's okay.

40
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,308
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
Just trying to help.

41
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,394
It's okay. It's okay, Kiwe.

42
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,312
It's okay.

43
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,983
- Your mama... Your mama is here.
- It's okay, Kiwe. It's okay.

44
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,155
You all right?

45
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,324
- Mali, just like the others.
- Yeah, I know.

46
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,162
- This is an outbreak, Frank.
- We've got six cases.

47
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,664
- That's not enough.
- Oh, how many do we need?

48
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,207
Sixty?

49
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,084
Six thousand?

50
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,504
When does it start to matter?

51
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,265
We have to find the source, Frank.

52
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,478
You wanna go to Mali.

53
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,812
It's not gonna happen.

54
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:25,983
WHO isn't gonna lose
any more staff to a civil war.

55
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,695
- Here, finish your report.
- Good.

56
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,490
- Just in time for the autopsy.
- Eva.

57
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,245
I'll do what I can do.

58
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,165
I'll re-present to the board.

59
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,293
- And maybe they'll listen this time.
- Thank you.

60
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,296
We still need blood samples
from his father.

61
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,215
I'll find the father.

62
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,489
Hello?

63
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,494
Mr. Nwokolo?

64
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,214
Mr. Nwokolo?

65
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,287
Hey!

66
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,373
Help.

67
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,512
You have no business being here.

68
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,064
Quick, get her bag.

69
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,384
Are you okay?

70
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,168
Hey! Hey, pick that up!

71
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,713
What are you doing? Come on.

72
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,174
You're walking past...
All right, guys. Come on.

73
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:40,553
Guys, quit screwing around.

74
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:45,057
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on. All right, stop.

75
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,726
All right, hold it there.

76
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,103
Report any variances over two feet.

77
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,651
Here, hold on to these.
Come on, grab it.

78
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,822
All right. Come on, you piece of...

79
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,783
All right, give me a wrench.
I need the wrench.

80
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,493
Wrench! Anybody there?

81
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:12,335
All right, oil. I need the oil.
All right, the oil. Thank you.

82
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:18,466
That's it. All right, we're good!
We're good!

83
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,468
Sorry.

84
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,596
Here. Hi.

85
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,389
- Al Giordino.
- Eva.

86
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,433
- Eva Rojas.
- Nice work.

87
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,060
- Thanks.
- Welcome aboard.

88
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,603
Thank you.

89
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:36,525
All right, turn it on. Go down.
Go, go, go, go, go.

90
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,944
More. Keep going.

91
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,113
Hi.

92
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,115
- How are you? Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

93
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,492
- I'm Rudi.
- Sorry, where are we?

94
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,620
This is the Martha Ann,
It's a NUMA boat. Ship.

95
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,498
We didn't know who you were, so
we kind of patched you up ourselves.

96
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,458
You had an edema
of the upper tracheal track.

97
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,544
Rudi, I've been waiting
two months for this moment.

98
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,755
Don't mess it up for me
by letting him drown.

99
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,257
- Yes, admiral.
- Diver up!

100
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:05,471
In five, counting,
four, three, two, one.

101
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,404
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce to you

102
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,866
after a 772-year engagement
on the bottom of the ocean:

103
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:28,911
King Bateen!

104
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,166
Nice job, everyone.

105
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,794
Except you, Al. What the hell?

106
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:40,172
It's a 10-ton-rated winch,
my friend, not a fly-fishing rod.

107
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,675
You know what? You're thinking
of the Thompson 12-91.

108
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,011
Whereas you're astride a 12-93.

109
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,513
- Not that you could operate either one.
- Boys!

110
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:48,681
- Sir?
- Sir?

111
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,517
The king meets the people
at the museum in five hours.

112
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,686
- Don't worry, sir. He'll be there.
- He'll be there.

113
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:54,854
He better be.

114
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,689
Secure those cables!

115
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,818
Hey, look who's on her feet.

116
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,194
Thanks to you, I guess.

117
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:06,032
You were lucky to just lose your bag.
Dangerous city.

118
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,242
Damn it, I did lose my bag.

119
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,038
- Nothing worth dying for, I hope.
- Well, that's a tough question.

120
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,123
Nothing worth you dying for.

121
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,583
Hey, Dirk, get your butt up here

122
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,169
so we can scrape
some of the crap off this thing.

123
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,046
- Excuse me. The wife.
- Come on, ladies,

124
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,797
get Mr. Bateen unhooked.

125
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,550
Clean him up.
We got a party to go to.

126
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,594
- Admiral?
- Retired.

127
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,679
- Jim Sandecker.
- Eva. Eva Rojas.

128
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,890
I'm with the WHO.

129
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,477
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee.

130
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,605
- Hey, Dirk. Hey, I need your help.
- What?

131
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,816
- Is it left over right, or right over left?
- This better not be like last time.

132
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,027
I can't remember.
It's driving me nuts.

133
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,822
Is there something about a rabbit
going around a tree or something?

134
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,824
I'll be there in an hour.

135
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:52,828
- What, Dirk?
- That was Oshodi.

136
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,248
He thinks he might
have found something.

137
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,627
Oh, that's great. That is fantastic.

138
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:03,297
- Thank you very much.
- No, no, no, no, fantastic for me.

139
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:08,177
I can't wait to tell Sandecker that you're
not gonna be at the museum tonight

140
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,971
because one of your contacts
from the Nigerian underworld

141
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:14,266
has found evidence of a Civil War
ironclad shipwrecked

142
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,769
- In a storm off Africa. Yeah, right.
- Storm off Africa.

143
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:20,523
That's what you're talking about, right?
Yeah. Sandecker's gonna freak.

144
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,275
- Look, Al...
- And I'll be there. He'll turn all red.

145
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:27,947
The fox chases the rabbit around
the tree and down the hole.

146
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,701
That's how the tie works.
Don't you worry, I'll be there.

147
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,830
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

148
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,459
First, I'd like to thank the Lagos
museum for this magnificent reception.

149
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,294
I would also like to thank

150
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:46,173
our primary benefactor on this project,
Yves Massarde.

151
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,467
Thank you.

152
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:53,806
We are NUMA,

153
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,143
the National Underwater
and Marine Agency.

154
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,771
And this, ladies and gentlemen,
is what we do.

155
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,234
King Bateen.

156
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,322
- Where is he?
- He's not at the buffet.

157
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,033
- Damn it.
- Do you want another kebab?

158
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,411
With the help of museums,
with the help of governments,

159
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:19,081
private organizations like ours
can work in partnership

160
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,750
to make sure that history,

161
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,836
history that has been lost
to the tides of time,

162
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,423
can be returned to its people.
Thank you.

163
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,925
Thank you so much.
Have a lovely evening.

164
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,601
Do you have a CD burner
on that ship of yours?

165
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,812
Yes, the same one I bought
from you last month.

166
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:46,859
I have a wonderful piece, straight
from the Iraqi National Museum.

167
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:49,987
Don't show me things like that,
Oshodi. We're not that friendly.

168
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:54,200
Okay, okay. Now, here it is.

169
00:17:55,701 --> 00:18:00,289
A very special piece.
The one I spoke to you about.

170
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,086
It breaks my heart
just to show it to you.

171
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,053
Where did you get this?

172
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,971
Cash, please.

173
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:18,683
We are not that friendly.

174
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,077
This is a great party.

175
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,082
- Thank you for inviting us, admiral.
- The pleasure is mine.

176
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,501
Yves, this is the woman
I was telling you about,

177
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,420
- Dr. Eva Rojas.
- Hi.

178
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,755
I'm delighted to make your
acquaintance. I'm Yves Massarde.

179
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,799
Nice to meet you.
This is Dr. Frank Hopper.

180
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,342
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

181
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,886
Yves does a lot of business
in Africa.

182
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,347
Some even in Mali.

183
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,475
Will you excuse me?

184
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,272
I understand you believe there is some
sort of plague coming out of Mali?

185
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,107
We don't like to say "plague."

186
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,151
- What do you think it is then?
- A plague.

187
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,319
So you do business in Mali?

188
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,697
Do you know anyone there
who could help us

189
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,158
by pressuring the WHO
to send a team?

190
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,161
Well, you see, much of Mali
is controlled by a warlord.

191
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:22,246
General Kazim. Do you know him?

192
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,082
Yes. He used to be a colonel
in the Malian army,

193
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,460
and gave himself an upgrade
the day he shot the president.

194
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,670
He's the man who put the "war"
back into "warlord."

195
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,213
And he controls the country?

196
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:33,174
Half of it. And the other half
no one controls,

197
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,009
but I don't know which is worse.

198
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,721
But I have to warn you, it is very
dangerous for foreigners right now.

199
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,182
I would say it's probably
more dangerous for locals.

200
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,977
Yes, but your death would
look very bad in the papers.

201
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,021
So does the word "plague."

202
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,527
All right, I will call some people,
but at the end of the day,

203
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,864
I'm just a businessman,
so be patient.

204
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:59,033
Oh, yeah, she's good at that.

205
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:03,120
He's not gonna help us.
This was a waste of time.

206
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,707
Eva, we can't just wander into
the middle of a Malian civil war.

207
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,377
The fighting with the Tuaregs
is too severe. You know that.

208
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:12,254
I think we should go back
to the hospital...

209
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,257
Admiral, have you ever seen
a Confederate gold dollar?

210
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:17,385
- Dear God, don't start this again.
- Of course not.

211
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,053
The Confederacy never made
a gold dollar.

212
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,888
The mint was destroyed
near the end of the war.

213
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,973
Dirk, I beg you on my hands
and knees. Don't.

214
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,852
But not before Jefferson Davis
had five samples made.

215
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,814
He gave four of those samples
to his top generals:

216
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,067
- Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Johnston.
- Every time we come to Africa,

217
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,278
out comes that stupid ship model.
Out come the old port journals.

218
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,739
We are leaving for Australia
tomorrow.

219
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:40,574
Four of those samples
have been found.

220
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,703
But the fifth never was.

221
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,038
That one was given to
an old family friend of Davis.

222
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:49,208
A brilliant young sea captain
named Mason Tombs.

223
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,503
Captain of the CSS ironclad Texas.

224
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,258
- Where in the hell did you get this?
- Frederick Oshodi.

225
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,843
And he got it from a man
named Indigwe.

226
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,430
But the important thing is that Indigwe
found this in Labbezanga, Mali.

227
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:03,848
Hey, my dad collects coins.

228
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,601
No, that coin and the Texas
were on the Niger River.

229
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:10,271
It's impossible. An ironclad
couldn't make it with her draft.

230
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,648
Let me take the Calliope
to Labbezanga, have a look around.

231
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,109
- You can't have my boat, Dirk.
- Three days, admiral.

232
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,528
Just three days. Imagine.

233
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,113
Imagine.

234
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,618
All right, if I strike out,

235
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:27,121
you'll never hear another word
about this.

236
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,625
You got 72 hours.

237
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,794
And not a nanosecond more.

238
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,297
You fellas just bought
yourself a boat trip.

239
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:39,258
You're a gentleman, admiral.
I don't care what they say about you.

240
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,969
I got a bottle says we never find it.

241
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:46,599
- Make it a case.
- All right. You're on.

242
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,292
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See you later.

243
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,670
Hey, yo!

244
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,049
- You're late.
- Excuse me?

245
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,385
- I was told 8:00 departure.
- Eight o'clock?

246
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,428
- I never said 8:00.
- I said 9.

247
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,180
- Nine.
- It's after 10.

248
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,556
Who said 8?

249
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:29,517
Admiral Sandecker.

250
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,852
Yeah, he said to give him a call
if you had any problems.

251
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:33,896
A problem? With what?

252
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:37,066
He wants you to take us
up the river to Mali.

253
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,653
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

254
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,948
- Taking you to Mali?
- Wait.

255
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,908
There's been an outbreak in Mali.

256
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:49,954
- It's going to become an epidemic.
- And you wanna hitch a ride, doctor?

257
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,707
What, WHO's making
budgetary cutbacks?

258
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:54,542
Please. It's important.

259
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,212
- You guys got enough gear?
- Probably not.

260
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,512
Small boat. No privacy.

261
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,889
I'm not shy.

262
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,723
Where do you call home?

263
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:35,226
I have a house in Monterey,
but I'm never there.

264
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,853
Monterey. There's great diving
in Monterey.

265
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,356
Is that all you ever think about?
Diving?

266
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:44,652
No. Sometimes I think about
Petricola pholadiformis.

267
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,863
The angel wing clam.

268
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,658
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

269
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,202
This river's the only place
on earth they're found.

270
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,121
When they're underwater,
they glow in the dark.

271
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,040
Now, the amazing thing is that
modern science cannot explain why.

272
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,709
There must be a reason.

273
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,878
Till then, my theory is that
they do it because they can.

274
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:05,506
Dirk! That's it. Let's go.

275
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:07,800
Angel wings.

276
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:12,221
World would be a lot cooler place
if more of us were like that, huh?

277
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,988
This is the center of the cluster.
Here. Asselar.

278
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,906
That's where we have to go.

279
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,159
Right in the middle
of Kazim's civil war.

280
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,828
Hey, you ever been
after marlins, doctors?

281
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,205
Oh, no, not
the marlin story again, Al.

282
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:40,916
Seven hundred
and thirty-three pounds.

283
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,878
Five and a half hours
in the fighting chair.

284
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:47,173
- I thought it was 600 pounds.
- Hey!

285
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:51,093
What did you catch that day?
I can't remember anything at all.

286
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:52,887
How long you guys been together?

287
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,849
Oh, since kindergarten.
College. Navy. NUMA.

288
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,393
Poor guy's always
been in my shadow.

289
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,229
Always the Al's-maid, never the Al.

290
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,148
Right?

291
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,488
Nice, doc.

292
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:12,448
You're pulling your weight.

293
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:19,038
- My watch, chief.
- All right, my man. Excellent.

294
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:27,421
Your friend Al told me all about
your Captain Tombs and his boat.

295
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:29,256
Oh, he did, did he?

296
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:33,094
He also said ironclads were
not made to cross the ocean.

297
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,930
Well, neither was man. Tequila?

298
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,769
And you found a coin?

299
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:46,774
Not just a coin.

300
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,820
I found the coin.

301
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,948
Now, I also have a letter
from the captain's widow

302
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:57,451
alluding to her husband's
urgent Eastern voyage.

303
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,787
I have a sailor's log
on an Atlantic clipper

304
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:02,707
who swears on a stack of Bibles
he saw a great iron beast

305
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,376
steaming two miles
off the African coast.

306
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:10,923
Now, what kind of man tries to take
a ship like that across the ocean?

307
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,468
Why? How?

308
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,512
I don't know.

309
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,264
But I plan on finding out.

310
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:26,439
Al loves it when people ask me that,
thinks it makes me look a bit:

311
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,492
This must be nice.

312
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,329
To have this as your office.

313
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:45,124
Well, every great thing that's ever
happened to me

314
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,876
happened in the water.

315
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,963
Every one.

316
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,977
Hey, Rudi, come on,
help me out with this.

317
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,146
Oumar.

318
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,482
- You got it?
- There you go.

319
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,069
- How long to Asselar?
- Oh, six, eight hours. No problem.

320
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,029
- You stay for long?
- No, not long.

321
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:16,781
All right, this one too.

322
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,533
- Think it'll be safe?
- Oh, it's okay.

323
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:22,828
Where we go now,
no fighting. No problem.

324
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:25,706
- Yeah, no problem.
- No Tuareg.

325
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,710
Listen, I've been thinking.

326
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,880
When this is over,
there's a place I know.

327
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:35,007
It's called Monterey.

328
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,426
- Never heard of it.
- No?

329
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,804
It's got a beautiful beach.

330
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:43,265
Golden sands, aqua-blue surf.
The place is paradise.

331
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:44,892
- Sounds good.
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,355
I also happen to know a woman
who has a house there.

333
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:53,317
And because she's a workaholic,
she's never at home.

334
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:56,529
Now, I haven't asked her, but I'm
pretty sure that she wouldn't mind

335
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,863
if you dropped by.

336
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,573
Can I bring a friend?

337
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,827
You'd have to ask her.

338
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,954
I already did.

339
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,415
You did?

340
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,085
You, me and the bay of Monterey.

341
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,463
Thank you for everything.

342
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,424
- You're welcome.
- And good luck to you.

343
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,719
You as well. Bonne route, doctor.

344
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,488
Mr. Indigwe, he lives...

345
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,953
Indigwe. He find this
one week before, yes?

346
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:56,839
You know, I'm not
too much of a linguist...

347
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,050
...but that didn't sound too good.

348
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:01,427
Indigwe is dead.

349
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:06,682
Yeah. Hey, the check.

350
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,352
What is "the check"? L'addition,

351
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,488
Hey, you know, my dad
collected ancient coins.

352
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:24,950
From Rome, China, Siam, Persia.

353
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,454
Somehow they all ended up
in a shoebox in New Jersey.

354
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,084
- Meaning?
- Coins travel, Dirk.

355
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,630
Even if that poor guy was still alive,
it could have been nothing.

356
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,967
Yeah, but the coin traveled
from somewhere, Al.

357
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:44,470
And unless it hitched a ride
on the back of a dolphin,

358
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,263
I'm gonna guess that
its jumping-off point

359
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,808
was a little bit closer
to where we're sitting.

360
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:54,730
Really, you can see that ironclad
steaming up the river? I mean, really?

361
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:58,567
Isn't it more likely that we missed it
somewhere off the coast of Virginia?

362
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:02,113
Right?

363
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:05,199
Hello?

364
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,119
Dirk.

365
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,081
I'll meet you at the boat.

366
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:18,295
No, I got the check.

367
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,589
Don't worry about it. I'm serious.

368
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,258
I know, I get it all the time.

369
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,095
Sit down, I'll get the check.
L'addition,

370
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:22,818
Ya-Sheikh.

371
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:24,945
My name is Dirk.

372
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,699
I'm looking for a boat.

373
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,746
And when would we be
seeing this boat?

374
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:38,167
About 140 years ago, in 1866.

375
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:42,004
Back when Labbezanga was
one of the greatest ports in Africa.

376
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,631
Do you know anything else?

377
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,677
We use events to find dates,
not dates to find events.

378
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:50,763
Well, there was a storm.

379
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,848
There was a great storm.

380
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,226
One that would have raised
the depths of the Niger

381
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:58,187
enough to allow the boat
to get here, yes.

382
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:08,572
It is written here.

383
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,909
Six days after the great storm,

384
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,873
a dark ship rode without sails
under the banner of a single star.

385
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:22,837
It was driven upriver,
never to return.

386
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:25,214
Bearing...

387
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,717
...death.

388
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,721
It brought a sickness
from here up to Gao

389
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:36,559
and bore over 300 souls to heaven.

390
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,812
It was believed a damnation
from Allah.

391
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:42,356
A ghost ship.

392
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:44,567
A cursed ship.

393
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,577
What does that mean?

394
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,839
- What?
- That's Arabic, Al.

395
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:08,591
Yeah. Sounds poetic.
What's it mean?

396
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:10,593
"The ship of death."

397
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,803
Great. Should we call Sandecker?

398
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,972
- No.
- What ship? Whose death?

399
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:16,515
He'd just tell us to come home.

400
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:19,185
- Sounds reasonable.
- Yeah, then I'd get a case of tequila.

401
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,437
Boys, we are going upriver to Gao.

402
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:25,024
All right. Rudi, you gonna run
the sonar on the riverbed?

403
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,860
Come on, I was hoping to meet
a girl on the Australia trip.

404
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:30,488
No, African war zone. Ship of death.

405
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,703
Bye.

406
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,607
- Got a profile.
- Another truck bumper?

407
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,609
Bicycle? VCR?

408
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:12,071
Sixteen degrees, twenty-decimal-zero
minutes north, zero...

409
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,991
Wait, hold on. It's just
some interference with the buoy.

410
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,993
- Al.
- Yeah, I got it.

411
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,494
When did you check the calibration?

412
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,162
I had it out of the water
three hours ago.

413
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:21,872
All right.

414
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,335
- Anything, Al?
- Hey, guys.

415
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:29,005
Take a look at this.

416
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:35,594
It's red algae.

417
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:38,681
That doesn't make any sense,
this is fresh water.

418
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,808
- I'd better get a sample.
- Yep.

419
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:01,203
It's okay, they're just looking
for Tuareg fighters.

420
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:35,237
Very well, thank you.

421
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,698
For you.

422
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:41,243
Join me.

423
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:43,287
Thank you.

424
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:49,001
These belonged
to General Mayenne.

425
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,548
Then one of them actually killed
the Comte de Vezelay.

426
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:58,302
Isn't that fascinating?

427
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:02,431
Beads for the natives, Yves.

428
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:04,975
What do you want?

429
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:09,605
Well, you know the doctors
I was telling you about?

430
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:13,442
I am afraid they're
on their way to Mali.

431
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:17,321
I thought your man was going
to take care of them in Lagos.

432
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,241
- Well, we had a problem.
- And now the problem is mine.

433
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:28,457
And another thing, general,
if I may say,

434
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:33,004
I am slightly concerned
your measures of containment

435
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,755
are losing their effectiveness.

436
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:38,342
Why? Because five or six poor souls
escaped from Mali

437
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,970
- And died in their beds?
- The disease spreads quickly.

438
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:44,390
And luckily, it kills quickly too.

439
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:50,187
General, I think you should control
the movements of your population.

440
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,564
What's that?

441
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:55,818
Are you trying to tell me
how to run my country?

442
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,487
You take care
of your business, Yves.

443
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,656
I'll take care of mine.

444
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:02,867
Of course.

445
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:04,827
- Rocks?
- Nope.

446
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:08,497
- River? Radio?
- Nope.

447
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:11,208
- Radar?
- Rudi.

448
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,752
- You... That's not...
- It is.

449
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,837
- He can't even...
- Here we go again. I spy.

450
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:18,674
- All right, something I might get.
- I spy...

451
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,302
- I spy with my little eye...
- Guys.

452
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,182
- Company.
- This is the Malian Civil Authority.

453
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:28,517
- I got it.
- Prepare to be boarded.

454
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:30,853
You are trespassing
in Malian waters.

455
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,521
Shut off your engine
and throw out a rope.

456
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:35,191
Hi, this is Al Giordino speaking.

457
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,361
Al, Sandecker. I presume you're on
your way home with my boat?

458
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,279
- Everyone on deck, right now.
- It's for you.

459
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:42,448
- Al, what's going on?
- Where are the doctors?

460
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,742
Where are they? We are looking
for the doctors.

461
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,703
I have to put you on hold. I don't
believe this is a normal shakedown, Al.

462
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:52,416
If you do not shut off your engine,
you run the risk of being fired upon.

463
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,086
The doctors. We are looking
for the doctors. Where are they?

464
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,963
- Where is the woman?
- I'm sorry. I don't speak English.

465
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,007
You are speaking English now.

466
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:03,636
No, no. I only know how to say,
"I don't speak English," in English.

467
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,724
- Al.
- Hi. Hold on.

468
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:12,061
Stop! Stop the engines now
before we open fire.

469
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,108
Whoa, hat!

470
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,991
- Did you get my hat?
- Sorry, it's gone.

471
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,159
That's my favorite hat.

472
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:42,758
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

473
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:46,512
- Where's Dirk?
- I think he's...

474
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,442
Hold on.

475
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,479
Dirk! Dirk.

476
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:48,991
I'm gonna come in.
You jump on the front.

477
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,036
- You want me to jump?
- Get on the front of the boat. Got it?

478
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:54,163
- Really?
- What am I...?

479
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:04,924
- Al!
- What?

480
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,388
Here, flare gun.

481
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,890
- Signal for help?
- No, shoot them.

482
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:23,359
- Hey!
- Sorry.

483
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,739
Come a little closer, babe. Come.

484
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,164
Oh, yeah!

485
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:59,603
That is what I'm talking about.

486
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,469
- Are you all right?
- That was close.

487
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,095
- Al, pick up the phone,
- Yeah, it was.

488
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:34,764
- How about you?
- Pick up the phone,

489
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,432
- Glad I'm driving.
- Still there?

490
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,309
- I am too.
- What the hell is going on?

491
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:39,977
I shot a guy with a flare gun.

492
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:41,979
- A flare gun? What?
- Cool.

493
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:42,688
What did you...? Did you say you
shot someone with a flare gun?

494
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:45,274
What did you...? Did you say you
shot someone with a flare gun?

495
00:42:45,483 --> 00:42:47,109
- What?
- Who?

496
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:51,405
Don't put the phone...

497
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,660
Rudi?

498
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:08,297
Who's shooting? Al, who's shooting?
Is someone shooting at you?

499
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:09,965
You'd better not hurt my boat,

500
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:12,927
Engine two is out.

501
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,596
Fourth and long, man.
What do you wanna do?

502
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:22,561
- I think we need to pull a Panama.
- A Panama. A Panama?!

503
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,398
- Panama?
- You think? Really?

504
00:43:25,648 --> 00:43:27,233
- Yeah. Really.
- No Panama,

505
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:30,903
Somebody pick up... They're
ignoring me. They're ignoring...

506
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,280
Everybody's ignoring me.
Pick up the phone!

507
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:35,366
Take it. We're doing a Panama.
We're doing a Panama!

508
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:37,034
- What's a Panama?
- Navy thing.

509
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:39,870
- I didn't know you were in Panama.
- Weren't. We were in Nicaragua.

510
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,290
- Then why do you call it a Panama?
- We thought we were in Panama.

511
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,960
No Panama,

512
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,839
What are you looking for? Al!

513
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:03,644
Al. Al, I'm really confused.

514
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:13,696
How we doing, Al?

515
00:44:14,572 --> 00:44:16,073
- Go help Dirk.
- What do I do with this?

516
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:17,575
Just go!

517
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:19,535
Down.

518
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,081
- Open the engine hatch.
- Okay.

519
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,543
Let's go, Al.

520
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:33,924
Got it.

521
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:37,178
Here, light this.

522
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:40,931
- Aren't these the admiral's?
- Just light it.

523
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,692
What the...?

524
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,486
Whenever you're ready, Al.

525
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,613
- Come on!
- What are we doing?

526
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:58,991
- I don't think you should be doing that.
- Okay. Drop it.

527
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,410
- We're good.
- Yeah?

528
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,079
- All right, hold on.
- Hold on.

529
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:04,747
Okay.

530
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:10,795
Al!

531
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,055
Hey, I need a life jacket.

532
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:41,784
Crap.

533
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:43,995
He did a Panama.

534
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:46,163
He did a Panama.

535
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,542
Cool.

536
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:52,545
- Is that how it worked the first time?
- Well...

537
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:55,589
...it didn't really work
the first time.

538
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:00,344
- I lost my hat.
- Again?

539
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:01,762
Yeah.

540
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,859
Man, is Sandecker gonna be mad

541
00:46:15,026 --> 00:46:17,320
when you tell him
you lost the satellite phone.

542
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:20,239
Not as mad as when Rudi tells him
it was attached to the boat.

543
00:46:20,448 --> 00:46:23,409
- Wait. Why me?
- Because we're not going back.

544
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,619
- Right, Dirk?
- Nope. We're going to Asselar.

545
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,457
- No more Texas?
- Ironclad's on hold for a while, guys.

546
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:32,335
Those soldiers weren't after us.
They were after the doctors.

547
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:35,629
I got a feeling whatever bug
Eva's chasing, it must be a doozy.

548
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,757
- We gotta get there first.
- I'm going with you.

549
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,925
- Nope, you gotta tell Sandecker.
- Hold on. Hold on.

550
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:42,970
How am I gonna get across the border?
I never took survival training.

551
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,389
- Consider this your course.
- It's kind of pass-fail,

552
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:47,058
which I always thought was easier.

553
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:51,062
Look, Rudi. Lay up here till dark, then
make your move. The border's not far.

554
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:52,563
- Okay.
- All right.

555
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:56,901
Al, you remember
that time in Morocco?

556
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:00,321
Oh, yeah, when you made me ride
that damn camel

557
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,949
- That bit my ass.
- Yeah, that's the time.

558
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:06,661
Why?

559
00:47:14,752 --> 00:47:17,963
God! What is the secret
to this thing?

560
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:20,675
Just wrap it around your nugget.

561
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:25,137
- What part? Here? This?
- Yeah.

562
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,266
Well, how come yours stays on?

563
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:31,602
Maybe you got a small head.

564
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:36,232
I don't think so.
Somebody would've told me.

565
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,717
Thank you.

566
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,682
World Health Organization.

567
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:11,767
Hello?

568
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:14,061
Is anyone here?

569
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,360
Frank.

570
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:23,738
Look at this.

571
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,421
Anyone here?

572
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,721
Hello?

573
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:54,810
Hello?

574
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:12,036
Oh, my God.

575
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:31,157
This well was filled in recently.

576
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:33,826
I think people here knew
the water was making them sick.

577
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:36,620
I still say we should
let Oumar go down.

578
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:39,165
Oumar, you wouldn't mind
going down that well, would you?

579
00:50:39,415 --> 00:50:40,875
- No, it's okay. I'll go down.
- You see?

580
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,918
Frank, I'll be fine.

581
00:50:53,304 --> 00:50:55,306
Yeah, there you go.

582
00:50:57,058 --> 00:51:00,144
All right, you're looking good.
You're looking good.

583
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:02,938
- Give her a little more rope.
- Okay.

584
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:07,693
Be careful, please.

585
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:10,529
Just take your time.

586
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:12,114
Eva.

587
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,991
Eva, hold on.

588
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:17,495
Eva. Hold on. We've got you.

589
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:18,829
- You got it?
- It's okay.

590
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:22,500
- Bring her up.
- No, I'm fine.

591
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:24,543
Give me more rope.

592
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:34,387
Got it. I made it.

593
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:49,485
- Got water.
- All right, great.

594
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:51,946
Get what we need,
and let's get you out of there.

595
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:55,324
Hey, looks like we've got company.

596
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:58,869
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

597
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:00,371
Okay.

598
00:52:00,538 --> 00:52:02,873
Hello there. I'm Dr. Hopper with
the World Health Organization.

599
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:05,960
- You have no authority to be here.
- What are you doing?

600
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,587
Eva, get those... Oh, my God!

601
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,674
- Frank!
- Charlie, please don't shoot me.

602
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:13,592
Charlie, don't...

603
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,414
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
do you hear that?

604
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:08,147
- This is all of them?
- Yes, sir.

605
00:53:09,607 --> 00:53:14,528
The UN knows that we're here. This is
a United Nations-sanctioned mission.

606
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:19,492
Where's your colleague?

607
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:24,664
No, no, no, no, no.

608
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,916
I mean, the woman.

609
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:32,004
She didn't come. She's ill.

610
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,302
This pistol, it belonged
to General Sir Henry Watkins.

611
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:41,847
.455 caliber. Very rare.

612
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:44,850
Hard to find the rounds.

613
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:50,022
I have them made
by Holland & Holland of London.

614
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:56,487
Twenty-seven pounds each.

615
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,533
You should put the money
to better use.

616
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:03,661
Like containing this plague.

617
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:21,012
I will give you some advice.

618
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:25,433
Tell me where Dr. Rojas is.

619
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:28,227
She's not here.

620
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,897
Have it your own way.

621
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,747
Make it look like a horde of Tuareg
swine just came through here.

622
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:50,082
- And find the woman.
- Yes, sir.

623
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,584
She's here.

624
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:54,378
Somewhere.

625
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,580
You men, set up a perimeter.

626
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:31,957
I want you to search
the whole town.

627
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:36,128
- Hey, Salim, come over here.
- Yes, sir.

628
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,660
Open up a few rounds
just to be sure.

629
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,334
Hey.

630
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,889
Al, little help here.

631
00:57:19,732 --> 00:57:21,567
Oh, man.

632
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:17,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Eva.

633
00:58:21,794 --> 00:58:23,254
Come on. You okay?

634
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:25,297
- Yeah.
- Come on.

635
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:28,551
We gotta go.

636
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:32,096
Wait. Wait!

637
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:34,807
Frank!

638
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:37,351
Frank!

639
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,150
We're done here.

640
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,176
We're in Tuareg country now.

641
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,889
We're gonna drive north about
three hours till we hit the flatlands.

642
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:19,101
From there it should be a relatively
easy drive to the Algerian border.

643
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:21,854
Sorry.

644
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:24,523
Eva.

645
00:59:26,651 --> 00:59:28,361
Eva.
